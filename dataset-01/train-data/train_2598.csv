1,No Upgrade,"I was pleased with its performance until I realized that Toshiba doesn't offer the upgrade to Pocket PC 2003. Seems like just a ploy for me to sell it and buy the 755, which is the same machine. Needless to say I'm not happy with Toshiba's support of this product."
3,Great PDA &#65533;...if you don&#65533;t have to connect to a PC.,"First the good new. The Toshiba E740 is a great value. Compared to PocketPCs like the iPaq, you get dual storage slots and wireless connectivity all in a very nice sized package. An add-on wireless card would cost you about $100 and take up a valuable slot. Add to this an excellent Amazon price and I believe this is one of the best bangs for the buck.Now the bad news. ActiveSync has serious flaws. I have had more problems in three weeks using ActiveSync with the E740 than I have had with by previous iPaq and Jornada over the past three years combined. Besides the ActiveSync connection going away a couple of times a day, the most frustrating problem is when I drag a file over to the E740 and ActiveSync disconnects in the middle of the transfer. Toshiba acknowledges these problems but does not have a date for a fix yet.I give the E740 5 stars, but the frustrating ActiveSync experience 1 star."
2,No upgrade path to WM2003,"I would not waste your time on purchasing a Toshiba PDA. I bought my E740 arund July of 2002 and it has been in for service twice for HW issues and stability issues.To add insult to injury, Toshiba will not be offering an upgrade to WM2003 for the E740 community. I would not trust them to do the same with their new ""flagship"" product, the E750...Buy another PDA, do not get burned..."
2,Sorry,"I haven't had it long enough to have had service problems, but otherwise I agree with the comprehensive list of criticisms in the other reviews."
1,No Go,Product never completed BETA testing. Owners are stuck with a device that was never finished. 12+ minor problems add up constant headaches. The monthly lockups are unforgivable. No PPC 2003 update is the last nail in the coffin.
3,My e740 was just recalled,"Up until a few minutes ago, I would have said I was very happy with my e740. Now, I discover that my unit has been recalled for some problem with losing all data in case the battery is removed or runs down. This recall will mean that I will be without my e740 for over 1 week. Toshiba is not offering ANY type of compensation for my inconvenience. A free extra battery would be nice. That's what DELL offered when they had the battery recall last year."
3,Love-hate relationship,"I love this machine since it is quite unbeatable in term of price/functionality. Unfortunately I also hate this machine! As lots of reviewers have revealed, the record button is really annoying-very difficult to avoid activating it by accident. And yes, it can lose all the data if battery is disconnected. Another problem is that the backup program fails to recognize the CF card from time to time, although there is a cure (deleting some files may help). This is a machine that users needs to learn the tricks to live with. The summary: good idea, bad execution."
1,Expensive junk,"I liked it because it is small, and includes WiFi, CF, and SD slots. The problem is that the battery meter is all over the map, and stuck at 1% most of the time. This prevents me from using programs, and causes me to get pop-up warnings. Lots of users have this same problem, but Toshiba thinks it can be solved by monkeying around with the software. This is a hardware problem, and Toshiba techs aren't trained to know and fix it. Overall, a very expensive paperweight."
3,Amazing in it's time,"Best PDA ever made when it was released! Only use now is for historical reasons, Toshiba made amazing PDAs too bad they never entered the Smartphone market!"
1,Piece of Junk!!! Don't buy,"I have a really cool paperweight for anybody that wants it. It sort of looks like a PDA, but isn't.Seriously though, I had my E740 for a little less than a year when it started doing hard-reboots like others have complained about. I contacted Toshiba and they had me send it in. They sent me a new battery when they supposedly ""fixed"" it.Shortly after the warranty expired, the PDA became totally unreliable and eventually stopped working altogether. That was over 4 years ago.Since then, I have been using a Dell Axim X30. It's like night and day. I have never lost any information with it. It's too bad Dell got out of the PDA business."
1,really bad technology,So how do you make a worse product? Put a lot of good things in and then have it not work. I've owned the 740 for four months. It's battery has gone dead a dozen times despite my best efforts to keep it charged. Buttons in the wrong place. No back-up battery circa 1990. Makes you give it a new name and go through set up again every time the battery goes dead!!!! All this led to syncing problems. And Toshiba is of absolutely no help. A very very bad product. Anyone thinking of buying one should immediately look elsewhere.
1,Avoid this device,"1) Slow - even with the more expensive processor2) Unreliable ActiveSync software3) Under recall4) Poorly light screen with poor colour reproduction5) Low quality speakerOverall, a seemingly great device on paper which is poor in reality"
1,Loses all Data if not continually recharged,"I purchased this PDA assuming it would be an improvement over my Palm because of the color, Microsoft compatibility and wireless feature. It does function alright except if it is left off the charger for a day. Then it loses all data and I have to reload all the programs, contact list, emails, to do lists, etc. I did send it in for the voluntary recall, but this one doesn't do any better than the first one. If you ever ""forget"" to leave it in the charger overnight, then expect all data to be lost the next morning and you'll have to reload everything. Because of this, this PDA is useless and just sitting on my desk. I have resurrected my old palm monochrome.Be careful buying this because Toshiba does not give refunds even on bad equipment."
1,not reliable,"I bought the pocket pc to read e-books. Every time it ran out of battery I had to reinstall the operating system and the e-book. It took too much of my time. I used to be paranoid about the batter level. I still would like to buy a pocket pc but I don't want to reboot it every time the battery runs out. What should I look for?I saw the iPAQ 111(64MB SDRAM), and iPAQ 211(128MB RAM) with 256 FLASH ROM.Do you think that the FLASH ROM will solve my problem?Do you recommend the iPAQ 111 for e-booking and personal use?"
3,Good for office productivity but not so good for multimedia,I wish Toshiba would have given some more attention to the recording feature. I've a compaq Aero (very old model). Even the recording quality of that surpasses that of Toshiba e740.
1,Buggy Device - Worst Support of any PDA Co.,"Aside from Toshiba being the only company in PDA history to initiate a recall, they are also extremely incompetent in their service dept.I've had Palm's, Ipaq's, Jornada's and never had a problem. Since getting this PDA, I've had nothing but problems!! Don't be fooled by the price- you get what you pay for!! But don't take my word for it- Search the web and newsgroups for the words ""e740"" and ""problems"", sit back, and enjoy!"
2,toshiba is inflexible to deal with,"The product is great, but Toshiba corporate is the pits. They recalled this pda, and don't offer any compensation for the trouble."
1,More trouble than it's worth,"I ordered the e740 in August 2002 and I have never been satisfied with it. First, I simply cannot get the wireless function to work with my wireless network. I have even tried to get support from Toshiba but they just referred me to a 3rd party sponsored website. There was absolutely no help in setting this up to network. Next, this puppy loses ALL MEMORY AND DOCUMENTS if you run out of battery power, and you can do that very easily, especially by mistake. I recently loaded it up with memory for a trip, with documents which I needed. The darn thing turned on in my luggage, and when I arrived at my meeting I had no documents, no power, and no way to get them back without syncing to my computer at home. I am fairly sophisticated with electronics and computers, but this thing is beyond me. By something else. Anything!"
1,Loss of Data and Programs - No longer supported,I bought this product when it first came out last December and even though it isn't one of the serial numbers that was recalled anytime my battery runs down to 0 you lose all of your data and any programs you have installed. This has happened to me on vacation and on an overseas business trip and makes the product worthless.Toshiba no longer suppports this product so if you get a bad unit you are on your own.
1,What a peice . . .,"I have tried everything that I can think of to make this $500+ PDA work for me. It has been back to Toshiba twice. I puchased the PA3197U 1BRL ""high capacity battery pack."" It is still the single worst electronics purchase of my life.The main problem is that the e740 will dump ALL my data at a whim. It randomly resets and looses all my data.If you have any use for a PDA that will require that you COMPLETELY set it up and re-sync it in order to recover your data, Toshiba has a PDA for you !If you are looking for a company that will answer your customer service needs by selling you additional, over-priced accessories that will in NO way resolve your problems, consider giving your business to Toshiba."
1,Screen cracks,"Please be careful. This product has an inferior screen to others out there. The screen is also not covered by the company, so you will be back in your pocket to replace the screen."
1,Problems with Screen !,Love product at first but Screen when out after just 4 months of usage. No help from Toshiba but had to pay them to get it fix. This seems to be a continual problem with this product. Don't buy unless you want to spend another 130.00 to get screen fix!
2,Fanciest gadget I got stung on,"After 6 months, the unit has been back to Toshiba 3 times. Not all of the product is covered under warranty. The repair cost is substantial if it is an item not covered like the display (suddenly went blank) They never did fix the battery problem. Data lost even with a charged battery. Toshiba blames all the bugs on Microsoft. If you purchase a Toshiba product and get burned, there is probably a club forming somewhere. The things that did work made it seem worthwhile though. It is a shame a company like Toshiba doesn't service their product very well."
4,As handy as a PDA can be!,"Many of the reviews here seem to have been written prior to Toshiba's recall of this model for a back up battery defect. I've had no problems with data loss yet, but will be sending mine back for its recall work (all paid for by Toshiba, including the mailer).Setting up the wireless was a breeze with my home systems, a little bit more difficult with my work VPN based system. But all in all this has been a significant plus for this PDA.With the new thumbkey board coming in a few weeks, this unit gets closer to a 5 star rating. I have the expansion pack and every keyboard I have tried through the USB connection has worked just fine. Ditto for the ATI based video out and screen mirroring.I've been very pleased with this PDA, after having used many varieties dating back to the original Newton."
1,"Failed after recall ""repair"", had to return again","...I had to first return it for recall (it worked fine before the recall) and it came back with power management totally screwed up. When the power management crashes, it turns itself on and heats up unexpectedly (great for warming hands in Winter or warming a bagel.) Toshiba would not replace the unit - insisting on trying to fix it again - even after all of this overheating.The unit will barely play MP3 files and has terrible performance. The record button is so badly placed that every day I get home to find that little snippits of my day have been captured in wav files on the unit..."
3,E 740 problems,This is a a great PDA execpt for one thing. It is has NO built-in memory to save stored data. The E 750 took care of this problem and Toshiba essentially stifed the owner of the orignal -including my letter to them which was written before one year warrantee. They never even answered my letter.Their answer was to give you a $40 credit towards their old defective E740. Good customer relations - Toshiba
3,Toshiba e740-Good feature/value unit.,"The e740 was great in its time, but now it has been bested by HP's new iPAQ 5400 series iPAQs, which not only have built-in WiFi, but Bluetooth, Biometrics fingerprint security, Compaq's AMAZING transreflectived TFT display, a removeable 1250mAH battery (roughly 25% larger than the e740), compatibility with nearly all iPAQ 38xx/39xx accessories, and better sound quality. The WiFi in the 54xx series is greater range as well due to an external antenna.The e740 has two things over the 54xx...1) a jog dial, and 2) a CompactFlash slot (which the iPAQ requires a sleeve for)->not to mention price (the e740 can be had for $400 while the 54xx costs $699 retail). I also like the e740's jog dial. But beyond that, unless price is an issue, the 54xx is the way to go."
2,Its not secure if you dont store info on real pc,"My Pocket has been reseted 4 times already, I have only used it 4 weeks in the 3 months that I have it, it is really disapointing losing your information. With this gadget you have to be lucky first, and be on top of charging it all the time. To me it simply sucks."
1,Batteries not worth diddly,"I used to own one of these things, and I used mine to read books most of the time. However, I found the battery life to be almost useless, because it required recharging every 3 days or so. If I forgot to recharge, I would always have to restore my backup, and that was dicey at best.Finally, I just stopped using it altogether, and my kind hubby got me a sony clie' to replace it with. I couldn't be happier...nice color screen, batteries that last over a week w/o recharging, no lost data, no record button to accidentally record with. Oh, and half the price too. With all the rebates on that, it came out to $85. Although the e740 did mp3's just fine, I never used mine for that purpose, so the clie' was a good replacement for me.If you need an expensive mp3 player that might do other stuff for you, the e740 would be a ""good"" choice. Otherwise, look into sony's line of pda's...much more reliable. :)"
3,A fine PDA but not a great one,"It is a good PDA but for shure it is not the best one.the Cons.1) is the battery life is not the best one, and if you don't charge it frecuently you can lose all your data, it had happen to my just twice in the 9 moth that I had own it2) It is big,3) you can not upgrade it to Windows Mobile 20034) it has the worst soundPro.1) the USB/VGA expansion pack is great2) the Wi-Fi integratedAlso I lost the stylus pen, so I bouth from Toshiba the pack of 3 stylus pen, for my soprise they where Belkin pen's in a Toshiba case. and they are really bad because they scratch the screen.I use screen protector, and I have to change it every 3 weeks becouse the replacement stylus pen scrach it."
1,Buy something else,Can't upgrade to mobile 2003 even though it is Xscale machine. Toshiba is ripping off people who bought this thinking they had some sort state of the art equipment. They simply dumped support and say sorry.
1,Literally Garbage,"I spent a lot of time trying to develop a Text Messaging/Mapping over MURS application for the PocketPC/WinCE platform in 2002, and picked up the E740 as my target device, thinking I was getting a ""good deal"". But Toshiba never supported this device properly, and its Operating System couldn't be upgraded... besides, the thing was a piece of junk anyway - constantly losing all your data, and a big hassle to synchronize... I had been a happy Palm user before, and was quickly dismayed at the poor quality of the device.There was some hope for a Linux OS upgrade for the device in late 2002, but that went nowhere as well.I'm not going to even try to sell this thing (along with all the accessories I'd paid good money for)... it is finally GOING IN THE GARBAGE RIGHT NOW (11/2/2008)... GOOD RIDDANCE!"
1,Terrible Customer Support!,"This unit has had more bugs than the dirtiest restaurant in town. However, the most frustrating part is that Toshiba will not communicate with its consumers about what they are doing or planning to do to remedy the problems. They have lied to, hidden the truth from, and ignored their customers. I have never had an experience with a company quite like I have with Toshiba...it will be my last experience, I assure you."
3,Software needs help,"Lots of neat features, but has some software glitches which really need to be worked out. Lots of us are having problems with false battery calibrations, and the software wasn't properly prepared for day-light savings time."
2,I should have bought a Dell,"I've had the unit for a while now it's in the shop for repair for the second time! I bought the Hi-Capacity battery accesserory and it worked fine, for 1 month. After charging all day, the battery meter would go to zero in ahout 3 hours. It's tempermental, some days working just fine other days I lost all my data. Backing up from the storage card was no pleasure either, It caused duplicate entries in all entries including programs.I don't need a toy, I have to use it in my business and it has to be reliable. I'm a pharmacist and use it to read reference texts and drug DB's.I'm not buying another Toshiba Pocket PC."
2,Think twice before purchasing.....,"After owning this e740 for a week, I can say that I am experiencing the problems reported by most other people. While the system is feature rich, these problems make using the system a little frustrating.The synchronization will drop intermittently. I have used the USB connection on 2 different computer systems and the IR connection and they all drop, so I am convinced it is the unit. I even upgraded the ROM to the latest version posted by Toshiba and this did not fix it.I bought a Sandisk 128MB SD card for the unit and it doesn't work. I replaced it with a Lexar and it worked flawlessly.I also had the problem of bumping the recording button, which accidentally turned the system on. Not the best place to locate that!I did email a problem to Toshiba support and heard back within 24 hours, so I would say that their support is very responsive.Overall a nice system, if you can live with the quirks."
1,Stay Away from this PDA,"Despite early fixes from Toshiba, this PDA still has frequent problems with hard resets (you lose everything), loose batteries (you lose everything), and no support (cannot be upgraded). I am junking mine and moving to any vendor that shows they support their products (unlike Toshiba)."
2,"Buggy, but if you want wifi for cheap...","Just bought one, and I'm probably about to return one. The e740 is ""best in class"" for its time, but only because no one at the time had integrated wifi. Can't really be called wifi, because you have to install an upgrade before you even have basic support for 802.1x. Reconfiguring for different access points is a pain - if you plan to use wifi, don't settle for any pocket pc 2002... go for 2003.ActiveSync disconnects often (in fact, using the most up-to-date ActiveSync will CRASH the sync software on the device).Compact Flash cards cause the device to hang at least a couple times a day.As long as you are only going to use the wifi on one access point, and will never using compact flash cards, and don't mind only using the device for 2 hours between recharging, the e740 is for you. If you want to use all the promised features, go somewhere else. It's not gonna happen."
1,Lousy Toshiba Support - Zero upgradability,"Avoid this product at all costs. If you are buying a Toshiba for its upgradability, forget about it. The e740 is full of bugs, and promised upgrades to an operating system that will take advantage of this processor are not to be provided. The attitude from Toshiba is really ""take the money, and forget about you."" If you're even considering the new e750, please reconsider and look at a Compaq. The difference in support is immense, and over the long run Compaq/HP really stands behind their products."
1,Wouldn't purchase Toshiba again,"After all the problems over the short time I've owned this (1% battery charge problem, active sync dropping, low battery life, etc) and now Toshiba's decision not to support the 740, I doubt I will ever buy a product for that company again. I owned an iPaq 3600 before and wish I would have stuck it out for the wireless iPaq (5400 series). Avoid Toshiba."
4,Finally switched from Palm!,"My Palm IIIc was dropped and started working erratically so it was time to change. For the basic functions, this thing is pretty much plug and play, so you can be up and running right away. The screen is nice and bright, better than my old Palm, plus now I have sound! Weight is about the same. The wireless works well, except my settings don't seem to stick, but I haven't had time to pursue it. Sync via IR is handy when you don't want to connect the cradle, but of course it's slower. Kept turning on recorder by accident at first, but learned how to avoid it. Only real complaint is the jog button, seems a little too touchy for playing games, or maybe it's just me. :-) Lots of function for the price!"
3,Amazon.com's Toshiba e740 ==> with Bluetooth or WiFi 802.11b ?,"Those who purchased this PDA from amazon.com, does it come with Bluetooth or WiFi 802.11b?The product description in this site only talks about bluetooth and wLAN (while wLAN can be anything...)I already emaild amazon.com for clarification without any response so far..."
2,Run like Hell,"If you want to buy a beta product, then go for it. Buggy; Poor, er, no tech support; not a great screen; many resets; you'll get to know the UPS guy after sending it back many times; etc., etc."
1,e740 - lousy support,"Have had several issues with this product. Back to manafacturer 3 times. Poor support from Toshiba each time. Tech support(Canada) is merely a call centre that dispatches purolator boxes to return the unit rather than a source of help.2 new motherboards and a new battery later its working fine..except that at less than 6 months old this unit is now obsolete. Toshiba has so far refused to support Pocket pc 2003 upgrade on this product.So much for an upgradeable product. Technically this product should be able to support 2003, but once again Toshiba has let its customer base down. I can tolerate a faulty unit, but not a product that is no longer supported less than 6 months old.Guess that will be the last Toshiba I buy. Please dont buy this product....save yourself some grief and give your money to a manafacturer that gives a damn about you."
1,Buy Something Else,"Buy something else. Whenever the batteries lose their charge, this unit loses all of its data.Visit www.toshiba.com and see for yourself. They have a recall notice right on their home page! Toshiba states that you can ""work around"" the problem by ensuring that your batteries never drain completely... not a very helpful tip!I read about this recall before ordering the unit, and I assumed that it only affected units that had already shipped. Bad assumption!UPDATE: We contacted Toshiba to have the unit repaired under warranty, and they REFUSED TO REPAIR IT! They said that since our unit's serial number was not part of the recall, they would not repair it. I know what you're thinking - that's so unbelievable that it can't be true, but it's true!We had to write numerous letters to Toshiba executives and wait over 30 days to finally get the matter resolved. It is now mid-April, and we still cannot use the unit we purchased in December."
5,"Very Good, but could do better on processor and screen","Toshiba e740 is the first handheld to deliver a device with Intel's XScale processor as well as built-in Wi-Fi (802.11b) connectivity. I like it very much, but the 400 MHz processor is not that much better in performance than it's predecessor e310. Also the screen on iPaq is better.But, if you want functionality, this is the PDA for you. It has WiFi card for wireless internet browsing and many features that other PDAs have. At ($)Amazon is selling it for cheapest price as of today.Overall a great value."
2,WiFi sucks battery,"I bought this for the integrated WiFi feature.Worked great, but the battery lasted a little over an hour. With the WiFi switch turned off the performance was in the range of three hours. I guess I was expecting at least a couple hours of use with the WiFi enabled. I wish Toshiba would have been straightforward regarding the unit&#65533;s battery consumption with WiFi enabled.I ended up returning it last week and will continue to use a laptop for meetings."
4,Almost perfect,The e740 is an overall excellent choice for anyone interested in a PDA. There are only a few drawbacks such as a poorly placed audio recording button and the fact that no extra software is included.
1,Mind of its own or no mind,Very frustating device. Constantly drops my Audible book program so all the software has to be reloaded. Feel like you have to handle with tweezers so as not to turn something on or off. Full of surprises. Very slow downloads. Nice screen. Looks good. I bought the spare battery which is a tight fit but after inserting it may crash machine.
2,Save your money.,"Yet another in tasteless series of self-promoting, self-aggrandizing books on the first O.J. case. Mr. Spence, obviously out to make a quick buck, has done what he accuses so many others as having done. Moreover, he has written 85,000 words on what anyone else could do in a few thousand! Despite the cover jacket, there are *NO* new revelations, just his updated and long-winded spin on matters. He finds fault with everyone connected with the case, and assures the readers that if he were in their shoes, he would never commit such errors in judgment. What drew me to the book was that he was an outside observer, but this work lacks journalistic objectivity. It is just another salvo in an ongoing battle of egos, and a disappointing one at that."
1,Arrogant and Boring,"Unfortnately, the last book on the OJ Simpson trial, before this one, wasn't the last word. Spence has become mesmerized by the persona he has created in the media. This book spends half the time telling the world how great the author is. The second half of the book is spent violating every aspect of an attorney-client privilege. Apparently he consulted with Mr. Simpson regarding anticipated litigation, yet concludes that this was not confidential, but a neat tidbit for his book. He thereafter includes the latest in promoting two storylines to attract media attention without foundation or back-up in order to gain headlines. This book is an incredible disappointment."
1,"O.J., ex cathedra","Gerry Spence has the abilitity to pontificate on any subject you can name. This time the topic is the Simpson case. Most of the book makes no sense at all, as Spence seems to be arguing all sides at once--but with sincerity and conviction. In the author's view, everyone involved was an idiot--or at least a moron--except Spence. The book isn't really worth reading since the author risked nothing of his own."
1,So Bad it's INCREDIBLE,"I would have thought it impossible to write a book on the OJ trial and hardly mention it, but Gerry Spence has pulled it off stupendously. In addition to rambling endlessly about his own great escapades as a cross between Abe Lincoln and Davey Crockett, he travels all over the roadmap in some kind of ""stream of consciousness"" writing I've never seen get past an editor. His totally disjointed, repetitive orgy of self-admiration actually began to fascinate me, wondering if he could really keep it up for 262 pages. Not only did he do it--he included an index. For WHAT?Here's a book that could only have been dictated, transcribed and edited purely by ""spell check."" I don't blame Spence for ""writing"" this book. I blame St. Martin's for publishing it."
3,Interesting in some ways but a poor novel,"I recently watched the 2008/2010 Survivors TV series (2 seasons) and enjoyed it quite a bit. I thought it would be interesting to read the book, as books are very often better than their film counterparts. For me, that did not apply in the case of this novel. The TV series developed the characters much more. The book is a fast moving description of how the characters handle the post-virus world. I found it interesting as an exercise in imagining what that would be like (and could be like), but it lacks substantially in character development, what makes each person tick, what are their traits, their complexity as individual humans. The ending was to me ridiculous, cheap sensation. Literary fiction it ain't, but it was still interesting to me to think about the situation. Basically, our society would go back to the Middle Ages. Not a fun prospect. Survivors was similar to One Minute After - also not great writing, but interesting to explore the situation."
5,Great DVD player!,"This DVD player is probably the best value one I've seen so far. It has more features than you can imagine. Some most useful features for me are:1) it plays all regions DVDs. DVDs and VCDs from Asia didn't play in my Panasonic player but no trouble here. Not all Apex DVD players are region free. ...2) For U.S. DVDs, you can switch from wide-screen picture to full-screen picture at a press of a remote button.3)Two microphones can be connected for karaoke.4) Kodak picture CD works on this player too. (I haven't tried it yet)..."
1,"I would pass on this deal, if I had it to do over....","Bought this DVD player 6/1, received 6/9, installed 6/15 (Father's Day present, along with the Clint Eastwood DVD Collection). Anyway, during the last few DVD's we've tried to watch, the machine has skipped screens, and reset itself to the beginning of the DVD numerous times throughout the show. Called Apex CS - was on hold for 43 minutes before reaching a person. Gave my info, was told ""good thing you called when you did, the 90 day warranty is almost up"". Got my RA# and will be returning this unit tomorrow for repair. Guess my advice is, if you want a good, cheap DVD player that will last you 2-1/2 months, this is your lucky day! Also note that Apex does not pay shipping costs for returns. Also note that estimated turnaround for the repair is 5-6 weeks."
1,No PAL support!!!,I notice in the tech specs and the picture of the remote control that this one doesnt support PAL like the previous models.I hate it when a company like APEX also starts to make DVD players which limit cross-compatibility for somebody like me(who buys videos around the world. PAL and NTSC).I verified on the APEX website and saw that the AD-2500 that they have on their website supports both PAL and NTSC. The one on amazon doesnt!!
1,Poor Quality,"The first unit I had was dead on arrival. The second unit I received was scratched but seemed to play alright. After two months of normal usage it began to randomly fail to play. It began freezing during films for up to 10 seconds at a time before continuing to play. This had nothing to do with the actual DVDs as the same scene wouldn't neccessarily cause the problem to repeat itself.Since others are raving about it, your mileage may vary. I imagine it is just really bad quality assurance on their part."
5,Excellent product! It plays everything,"Just want to emphasize its compatibly. There is no dvd code restriction on this player! It plays all discs my friend bought in Asia. Of course, it also smoothly plays dvd I rent from blockbuster. wonderful!!!"
2,"High compatibilities, low quality","The remote on my Apex DVD player stopped working after just few weeks; this leave me unable to navigate the menu since there is only a few buttons on the player itself.DVD player has problem waking after Power Off; the player would not decode properly, so the picture would be scrambled. I have to turn on and off several times to get it functional again. So basically you have to leave the player on all the time to avoid this problem.Good compatibilities, can play vcd without problem. Although it can view JPEG, it would distorted the ratio to fit into the TV frame, so it's basically useless for picture viewing."
4,Why spend more on SONY or PANASONIC get APEX ad-2500,"Searched for a name brand dvd w/progressive scan and afew more extra's such as playing PAL and being region code free! Not SONY, not PANASONIC, not RCA, not PHILLIPS, not SAMSUNG and only one JVC model[]did what the apex does so well! ITS PLAYS EVERYTHING FROM EVERYWHERE and PROGRESSIVE SCAN []wake up name brand makers! Apex lover for life!"
2,Died a quick death,"Used it for good 15 months. It was bargained priced for the features it offered. Average user interface. Played everything I put in it and for the time it worked, I really thought it was a good bargain. But like another reviewer mentioned, it won't read anything any more. Tries to load and ends up with ""no disc"". I'm sure somebody in China would want the metal casing back so they could recycle it into another feature rich bargain electronics."
3,"It's works, but it is cheap and loud.","It works fine, but it is put together very cheaply and it makes an awful hummmm noise about half the time. I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind your DVD player making loud humming noises."
2,Don't buy it.,"I bought my in July 03 and now in Sept. 03 I'm going to have send it back in for repair already. The player does not read read my DVDs (even the new ones) any more. It keeps saying that there is no disc. This is too much hassel for a $60 player. I'll have to pack it, send it in and wait for it to be fixed or replaced. The AD2500 is not bad, it does very much everything I want to use it for. But this is way too unreliable."
1,Terrible machine,"We ordered the first APEX AD-2500 and after two weeks it broke down (would not respond to the remote control). Amazon replaced it free of charge, but then 4 months later the new player broke as well (would not show the picture, though the sound continues coming). Very sad and a lot of hassle. I guess we get what we pay for, regardless of how many stars the product has :-)"
4,good cheap player,"I bought this because 1) it's cheap (plus no tax, free shipping), and 2) it has karaoke. For some reason, name brands such as Sony don't have that capability. Well, the karaoke works ok, definitely not like the audio you get at a karaoke bar, but good enough for home use. Besides capability of playing DVDs (even ones from China) and VCDs, I was surprised to see that it can play JPEGs. I scanned in many pictures and burned them on a CD, in different folders...and on the screen, you can choose any folder and view the contents. Needless to say, a great surprise!The only problem I'm having is that I have to turn the machine on 2 times in order to get it to play. The first time, there is no display, and after turning it off and turning it on again, the display pops up. Strange..."
1,worthless,"Apex has a 90-day warranty.....ours fried after 4 months. Repair is more expensive than a new machine. Do not burden yourself with this nonsense....buy something that works for longer than a few months.Not to mention: slow to respond to remote control, flimsy construction, poor substitute for a real cd music player with a good display, etc....."
1,Terrible,"It worked fine for maybe two weeks till it died on me. I would not recommend this product under any circumstances. Maybe I was just an unlucky person, but I rather not press my luck."
3,Take a chance,It is definitely a beautiful player. I only played VCD on it and it was working wonderfully. The first item shipped to me could not open the tray and I returned to get a replacement. Apex has a reputation of quality issues but I am taking my chance here. The power-off state has a red light on it and it is kind of annoying. It was also a little loud playing some disc. I also hooked up Y Pr Pb and try progressive scan on a DVD and it gave me a narrow small letter box with poor picture quality. I hope it is just because the DVD and will try a couple more today.
4,Not Too Bad for a DVD Player,"This DVD player plays all formats, does JPGS and AVIs and so on. The only problem I've had with it is the remote control. Pressing the power button; you need to be within 5 feet of the unit to power it on. You can be at a normal range to turn it off, but its the power on IR command that seems weak. Other than that, it has basic features and if your looking for a general DVD player, this is your winner."
3,Progressive Scan Failed,"This DVD player has the ablility to play pretty much every format you can imagine but the main feature for this DVD I think is the Progressive Scan capability. The bad news is, it doesn't work well at all with my Sony HDTV. The screen keeps flickers everytime when I switch from Interlace to Progressive mode. So if all you want is to have the ability watch VCD, SVCD, DVD...etc., might as well get a cheaper Apex instead."
5,"Read to work,","As soon as I turn on and put any video formate, it will play. I love it and you will love it too. Buy it for this low price and enjoy it."
3,not a free region dvd player,"I bought this one recently because I read the review and someone said it played all region dvd. But it is not, so im very disappointed with it. The buttons dont work very smoothly."
1,Apex is garbage,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. They do not care about the consumer and based on my past 1.5 years of experience there is virtually nothing we can do about it but stop buying their products.Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
1,"I will never buy another APEX machine, ever.","I had a slightly older model. It too was very reasonable priced, but it had a weak remote. APEX wouldn't do anything about the weak remote, but I solved that problem with a programmable learning remote.The DVD lasted just over a year- hardly longevity. Then I contacted APEX and it was so much to reapir, I decided just to replace it; but I'll be damned if I any buy anything from them again."
4,IT's NOT all region.,"I just got one myself. And it's not true that people hints/ siad about it's a region free player....This is NOT a all region DVD Player. Where are you from, ""davidxwang from Pittsburgh, PA USA"" ? What did you do with it to make this region free?"
1,Dead after 11 months,"I bought my Apex because of it's high compatibilies and functions; it has that, but ... The player is of low quality build. The remote stopped working after about a month; the player has problem properly decoding after powering off after a few months. Then it has problem playing periold. And finally, the disk loading tray won't even open after less than 11 months. It's not worth the trouble with Apex DVD player; there are plenty of other brands that can play vcd and other formats.On previous review, I gave it a 2 stars, but now that it has died, it deserves the 1 star that it is truly worth. Had I written a review a 2, 3 weeks after I bought the item, I would probably gave it 5 stars becuase of its attractive price and many features, but 2 weeks is not enough time to see the quality and reliability of a product. Stay away from Apex DVD player."
2,not impressed,"Had one, worked ok, played most dvds, sometimes hung up, after little over a year power supply went out. Got GF one, lasted about 4 months and now usually won't even recognise there is a disc in, or will freeze up before even getting to the menu screen. I don't plan to ever buy another APEX"
5,The Most Compatible DVD player brand on the Market,"I bought my first Apex (model 500) over 2 years ago for $100. I was amazed to discover later that it not only plays standard DVDs, but also VCD, SVCD and more recently DVD-R that I have authored!! I still have it. So when I saw the AD2500 for [item price] and free shipping, I immediately bought 2. This model offers progressive scan as well as component video output and it still plays all of my home-authored VCD, SVCD and DVD-R!! This is an incredible value, specially when you know that most name-brand DVD players DO NOT play VCD, SVCD, DVD-R, etc. So the AD2500 is the BEST product if you are looking for excellent video output as well as compatibility with every home-produced video format you can think of (except DivX, which I have not tried that yet!) and every brand of DVD-R disk!! There is only one item that is not as good as before: the remote control!"
1,"WAS GREAT WHILE IT LASTED, 2 WEEKS!!","USED THE MACHINE WONDERFULLY FOR 2 WEEKS, AND THEN IT DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE SMELL FOR A DAY AND THEN WAS DOA THE NEXT MORNING. I WAS USING THIS AT A BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, SO IT WAS A REAL BUMMER WHEN IT QUIT. I WILL SAY THAT I RECEIVED AN ABSOLUTELY NO HASSLE REFUND, BUT I THINK I AM GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM APEX."
2,"Not the end all, be all DVD player but good","Mistakenly I bought this player thinking that it played multi- region DVDs - it doesnt. Definitely not a sexy machine and the remote is basic looking also find that the signal strengh from the remote is poor. Main drawback for me was the menu to select mp3s. When playing a mp3 file you cannot browse the collection of mp3s without first stopping the file being played.Picture is great and sound too. For the price its a good player , not great."
3,Apex DVD player,Cheap and worth what you pay for it. Good for basic DVD playing. Might last a couple years.
4,A good buy!,"All in all I have purchased 7 units (one for myself, others for friends & family) and every one is happy w/it. I have mine over 4 months now, on average it played ~1.5 hr of VCD daily, never had any problems. Mine has no problem playing MP3, VCDs, SVCDs (in both PAL & NTSC format); I don't use it to play DVD much for I have a different unit hooked to a home system.I wonder if APEX has a poor quality control and thus there are the complaints from the others! I'll order 4 more units for my friends (as they don't have Internet access)."
3,"Good, general background with photos, no drawings","This book provides an adequate photo history of the Storch. The photoes are only of fair quality. There are no three view drawings or drawings that show markings. This book will provide some information for people building Storch replicas or models. There are books in Polish and German that provide more pictures that could be used to supplement the information in this book. There are few books on the Storch and this is the only one in English outside of the now out-of-print ""Profile"" series."
3,A Let Down,"I was disappointed with the quality of the photographs and lack of details, on the aircraft and those who flew them, between the covers. There are no color profiles to speak of. Not quite the Nowarra that I'm used to (Aircraft and Legend Series).I did also find a few mistakes to the captions, the most obvious one was on page 47, ""A Morane-Saulnier MS500 Storch in Service with the Thai Air Force."" Neither Fiesler nor Morane Storchs ever served with the Royal Thai Air Force(Thailand is the only nation in SE Asia that was never colonized). The picture clearly depicts a MS500 with South Vietnamese roundel on the fuselage and a South VN flag on the rudder!But for ten bucks, a price of a useless magazine at a newstand now a days, I gave it a 3 instead of 2 stars.FIESELER FI 156 STORCH IN ACTION by Squadron Signal Publication has much better content and photographs."
4,Interesting Historical Perspective - Fast Shipping,"This book has lots of pictures, and a good deal of informationabout a rare warbird. Fortunately, it is written in English-unlike the other more definitive texts which are mostly inGerman. If the photos in this edition were of higher qualityI would give it 5 stars."
4,Expected,This was really what I expected when buying this product. This is really all you need in a brush stand. I couldn't push my self to spend anymore then 10 dollars on something so simple. Overall I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap brush stand.
4,Real LIfe!,"The book was very helpful to me, esp. re: grieving the past, and his personal examples helped alot. But psychology as a science is fatally flawed and a leaven that has entered the Church and not been purged out, replacing the Bible with multi-false gurus who come and go. (Is this part of the apostasy warned about in the Bible? No doubt.) But for pointing out the problems with Divorce on adult children, it is an excellent read."
3,A Good Masal Movie,"It has been a long time watching Hindi mas ala movie. So why not go for it. If you feel anytime like that. And if you get a chance to watch this movie then give it a shot. Nothing to loose. The score for this movie is 50%. Screenplay was good. Acting was good. Good Direction. The songs in this movie are average.Usual Hindi masala. Friendship, love, vengeance, hatred, fight, killings, ending. Story goes very interesting for the usual Hindi movie lovers. Jackie, Sunny, Anupam have all done a good acting."
5,The fairies versus the manitous in a fantasy Ottawa.,"De Lint, who gets better with each new novel, is at his best when combining folkloric traditions as he does here with Mexican brujeria, Native American, and Celtic. The blend is becoming more seamless and the mix makes for fascinating reading. His plots are strong and his characters linger long after the last page is turned. His vision of the larger than life aspects of the mythos he so adroitly imagines is tempered by some very genuine, foible-full humanity. This is a grand tale in the greatest storytelling traditions and while he manipulates the myths and folklore to his purposes, he does with respect and the essence remains true. Captivating reading. If you enjoy the adult fairy tales of Angela Carter, Tanith Lee, Jane Yolen, and the similar series of short tales editing by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling, you'd likely appreciate this, as would readers of Borges, Garcia Marquez, and Jonathan Carroll."
3,disappointed in Kindle edition,I was disappointed in the editing of the kindle edition. There were several misspelled words and nonsensical sentences. I have the hardcover edition also. Love the original book.
5,Ah Mr.De Lint to even get a glimpse into this world......,"I think if I could live anywhere real or imagined it would have to be in a Charles Delint book. In fact now that I'm living in Canada and in his neck of the world I might see if I can look it up.I first heard of Charles De Lint when I puchased and read ""the little Country"" It was a bit confusing at first but after rereading it a second time it all clicked in with me. Now I can claim that I've read and/or reread most of his books. This one being the lastest I've had my hands on.All of his characters are clear and very well defined. As I read his books sometimes I think I can see or feel Jilly in the background or the Crow Girls laughing outside in the trees, or the Aunts shopping at the local farmers market. His melding of Native American Beliefs and Celtic Paganism/Druidism is remarkable!! There are such simularaties between the two.Now I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of The Onion Girl:) Cant wait to ""devour"" it!!"
4,"More action, less introspection","I totally enjoyed this book. However, it read more like an action adventure fantasy, than a typical DeLint novel. I found that I was more interested in the actions taken than the thoughts/motives driving the characters in this novel. If you are looking for a typical DeLint, you will find some of it here, but you will find more action and force than you normally see. I have noticed that seems to be a trend, though. There was quite a ""big action"" feel to the end of ""Somewhere to be Flying"", too. I do recommed you pick this up if you are a big DeLint fan. IF YOU'VE NEVER READ DE LINT, then go back & buy the three short story collections, first, to get yourself familiar with his people and his environment. You will enjoy this book much more if you do; it will give you a sense of history to the story and the characters."
3,"A good enough story, but...","While I enjoyed Forests of the Heart, I also found it to be the least satisfying of the six or seven De Lint novels that I've read to this point. As always, the ensemble cast is strong, with characters that make you either care for or despise them. But things get a little slow around page 90, and drag for another 50 pages or so. I feel that De Lint can sometimes put just a little too much gratuitous dialogue into some of his tales, and this stretch particularly suffers in that manner. The initial conflict between Donal and Miki seems somewhat contrived, not exactly coming out of nowhere, and yet leaving me wondering what's going on, until it's gradually explained in the narrative. Still, the overall premise is intriguing, and it's a good read, especially when you get past page 140 or so."
1,Gerber 07500 MP600 Blunt Nose,"I have always like Gerber and their one hand opening multi-tools but this tool disappointing in every way.The build quality is a joke, final finish on the plier head is bad because the edges are not straight, wire cutters are a total joke because they can barely cut the wire, the plastic lock sits crooked, and one hand opening is not smooth, in fact you have to hold only one handle and flick it in a just right angle very fast so it would come out from the first try. The plier jaws are also too stiff and need oiling before use and you need to work them a lot to make them smooth.The screwdriver heads are too tick and the small screwdriver is too small and not as precise to be a small precision screwdriver. The only thing I liked is the way tools lock and unlock, that part is very smooth and when you pull the individual tool out they actually come out one at the time. I think that people from Gerber should actually read these reviews and try to improve on their tools."
5,Gerber Multitool,Fast delivery and service was great!And as far as the productI think gerber makes a great product.I give them as gift all the time.
4,multi-plier blunt nose,"I would like to give this a five rating, but they now have the blade option being difficut to open, they don't have the groove in the blade matching up with the indentaion in the handle so its difficult to get the blade out. But I now like the blade being just that, rather than when they had (or have)the serrations also on the blade. Other than the indentations not matching up, it's a very good purchase."
2,poor quality,"My recent purchase of the Gerber 07500 Multi Plier resulted in disappointment. The mechanism is stiff, sticks and is clumsy to use.Previous experience with Gerber multi tools was excellent. They've lost quality control."
4,Tried it out of desperation...,"...after my favorite shave soap was discontinued, but became a fan after test-driving it for a few shaves; nice lather, easy on the skin, pleasant fragrance."
1,Don't buy anything from ViewSonic!,"I purchased two of these VX922 monitors and in less than two years, both of them failed. Black screen. The first one drove me nuts because sometimes it would come on and sometimes it wouldn't. It did that for a few months before finally failing. The second monitor just stopped working one day. There is a class action lawsuit against ViewSonic for their grossly deficient quality. I recommend that no one purchase any products from ViewSonic. Just because it works out of the box doesn't mean it will work a year from now. They seem to make products that are designed to work for at least one year but just past the warrantee, they fail. Thanks!"
4,Great for games,"Games look absolutely amazing.Oblivion never looked so good.Went from a 17"" Samsung Syncmaster CRT to this.DVDs look ok too.Only problem is the poor viewing angle.There's basically one position to hold you head and if you move it a part of the screen gets dark.It would be nice if the screen would tild forward and back more.An up and down adjustment would be great too.I'd still buy it again."
4,Satisfaction with the purchase,"I am satisfied with the acquired product, therefore it took care of my necessities. The image is very good and the screen is very great. It would like that the Amazon opened a store in Brazil."
2,What was everyone watching?,I love animated movies but this one just didn't make the cut. I wanted to kill the little girl in only a short time on screen. It was pretty don't get me wrong but even at this 7.99 I would never consider adding it to my collection.
2,I made a mistake,"I am a DVD collector. We don't watch broadcast or cable. We wait for the good stuff to come to DVD and then wait some more for it to be affordable. We scrutinize the reviews at Amazon and Rotten Tomatoes so as to not buy a total dog. We then apply the following criteria for purchase: ""Is it likely we will want to watch this movie more than once?"" Dragon Hunters passed all those tests and found its way into my DVD player. It stayed in there for about fifteen minutes. We found stupid, annoying and unwatchable. More accurately, unlistenable. The pictures are pretty. But that's it. Turned it off. Watch it twice? Couldn't even watch it once. And we lowered Amazon ratings credibility a notch. It's really a one star movie, but two stars reflects the creative animation. I suppose you could watch it with the sound off."
1,"movie is nice , but the dvd is bad","i have nothing agianst the story or animation iam against the description that it contains subtitles english and itdoesnt, i bought it twice , from amazone and from a seller, subtitles are impotant to many people out there, i dontknow about the blue ray maybe it contains subtitles , if anyone can help"
2,Had potential,"The animation style looks good. The characters from the blue bunny, little girl, Leon Chu, sheep, and little red flying things are cute to look at. However, the story and plot just weren't done well. There weren't many surprises in this tale, just alot of running around by the characters."
4,Cute animated film...,"Zoe dreams of a knight that will save the world from the terrible skeleton dragon. And one day she finds him! Except, Lian-Chu isn't really a knight, but rather a brave orphan who survived a previous dragon attack. Lian-Chu, with his sidekicks Gwizdo (interested in money) and a little runt of a dragon, decides to take on the job, which is pretty remarkable, given that all other knights came back either mad or made of ashes.It takes a village to slay a dragon, but no one is there to help Lian-Chu except his friends. Is this enough?Fun movie, with some intense scenes and a bunch of rather neat creatures and ""special effects;"" think Avatar meets Mulan. Animated."
4,Seems different from the other movies. Worth watching,"As much as I liked Dragon Hunters, I can't give it 5 stars. The only character I enjoyed through the whole movie, was Zoe. And the whole movie is not too exciting. Everything happens on the weird planet where everything floats in the air, and you don't see much of the humans or many dragons. Just a few characters, a few dragons. However I like to try new things, and so I watched Dragon Hunters and I liked it. But without Zoe it wouldn't be that good movie to watch. I would even watch second part if there was one."
5,For the Knight in us all.,"In our pursuit of all things Renaissance, we stumbled across this truly remarkable animated dragon movie.My grandson watches it over and over again, then studies the comic book while we travel. Well worth the money. Thank you Amazon for having such a great search engine."
3,boring,This movie was boring and confusing. I like to watch things with my children to monitor it and we were all up and down and it could not keep our focus ... (children ages 10 & 8)
3,Decent movie for the price.,This movie is ok for the price $9.99 is what I paid for it through amazon. Now for the kids point of veiw. My sons which are 2 and 4 years old prefer How to Train Your Dragon. Why? Be you get to see the dragons in that movie. In dragon hunters the focus is on the characters and not on the dragon so much. So if you are buying for a child go with How to Train Your Dragon
3,Good see-once movie,"Aimed at a more juvenile audience. Plot is rather simple. Kind of prophecy-fulfulling by comparing to an earlier ""book"" in the story about Silver Knight Gothic told to the heroes and so becomes self fulfilling.Great voice acting, Stunning graphics. But we're never given much of an explanation for how the world came to be like World of Warcraft's Outland and why the dragon looks like something straight out of Northrend."
5,"WOW this is a really good movie, where did it come from ?","A typical hero story with some really amazing visual images and neet characters that develop nicely, and one BOOM dramatic ending. We watched it three times in a row first time.I real nice surprise this was. The monsters are too fun to be scary."
3,Tries too hard,"Yes, it was visually spectacular. But so outlandish with the setting's fierce disregard for gravity, not unlike the unbelievable floating islands of Avatar. It was ludicrous, visually. Beautiful, but just silly.As for the plot, it was nothing out of the ordinary. I found the little girl character extremely annoying, as well as the whiny sidekick. There was not much to recommend this movie. I was very disappointed, after reading decent reviews. Viewed it on Netflix."
2,disappointing,"I stumbled across this movie while searching for some other DVD's for my 7 yr old son's birthday. I had never even heard of the film, but because of the rave reviews here on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a favorite at our house, so I guess I was expecting something more like that movie. I was really disappointed. The plot didn't really hold the interest of either the kids or the adults in our house. Very few scenes actually featured dragons. The story itself seemed a little dark to me, and I just didn't care for the way the violent scenes were depicted. I also didn't care for a lot of the language; not that there was any profanity, but I prefer that my kids don't learn to call each other ""stupid,"" or walk around talking about ""butts."" At least I didn't pay a lot for it."
5,Dragon Hunters,I saw this on TV and I just have to add this to my collection. It was funny and very entertaining I just have to share with my family.
5,Suprise hit,"I purchased this movie after reading the other positive reviews on Amazon. The quality is great, and the entertainment value is high. My 4 yr old daughter watches this mover over and over, it is in her primary lineup of movies for the moment."
5,An Animated Movie For The Whole Family!,"What a great family movie! I had never actually even heard of it until my daughter showed me at the store today! What a nice surprise. I suspected it would be another lame animated movie, with the same storylines and jokes. But it was very good! Very action packed for a child's movie. The ending was enjoyable and the characters were funny. My daughter, who is 7, really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great ""family movie night"" choice!"
3,Dragon Hunters (Blu-ray),"A welcoming competitor to all the Disney and Dreamworks animations.The story is surprisingly funny with a fairytale like twist. The Blu- ray gives you the experience you want from an animated movie with perfect picture and sound.I would recommend this disc if you like animated movies and the hint of fairytales. It hasn't the star gallery doing the voices, but is still worth the investment."
3,Okay,"Scary for a 3 yo, so my daughter did not like it. Maybe when she is a bit older we will give it another try."
5,The Dragon Hunters,My son had been wanting to see this movie. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.com and save money getting it for his birthday. The seller was very quick and the movie was as described. I love Amazon!
4,Flute case,This is a standard case and well-built. The old case has lasted over 20 years so I'm sure this one will last as long.
4,Thinnest and most practical,"I use Toshiba laptop as my prime pc so I dont expect to replace it with e310. In transit, can catch up with .doc, .pdf or even MS Reader format work documents conveniently. The amazing offline and online capabilities of internet explorer can shock some people. You can go online via cradle or read your websites offline. It not live online,yet but am sure with Wi-Fi card, this will be strong contender with the laptop. Especially waiting at the airports.Sleeker, and not clunky like Compaq and yet as powerful. If I didnt mind bulky, I will stay with the laptop and not buy.Compaq.If looking for compact flash slot, buy the e570 or e740."
3,Nice but no backup battery,"This is the fourth PDA I've owned, and while it has a lot to offer, you really need to ask yourself if the small size is worth the tradeoff of a ridiculously expensive main battery and no backup battery. I was used to getting at least a week on a charge (which I'm sure seems short to the Palm folks), but for this a long weekend of NON_USE can be enough to drain the battery. And that's not trivial, since there's no backup battery. Never again will I buy a PDA without a backup battery."
4,Excellent!!! But slightly unstable,"For the basics, Toshiba's e310 Pocket PC is excellent. Using the oh-so-familiar Windows operating system, navigation and programs are seemlessly integrated with your desktop. It is quite easy to download photos and games. The size is perfect -- not too small, not too large.The Pocket PC has several options for writing, including free style, letter recognizer, and the keyboard. It takes a bit of practice to use the ""handwriting"" styles. The keyboard is a reliable standby.On the down side, the system occasionally gets stuck and requires rebooting, especially when the battery begins to run low. This can be annoying, especially if you are in the middle of something. Also, the screen size is a bit small to properly use Excel or Internet Explorer.Overall, I enjoy my Pocket PC and am satisfied with my purchase."
2,Ebook reader only--very crashy,"I bought this device to read ebooks, and it does ok for a low price (like under $100). I use Word, Tiny Ebook Reader, MS Reader and Mobipocket. They all work, within limits.This device is extremely crashy and locks up a lot if you try to do too much. Make sure you never have more than one application running, and I would never trust my contacts or calendar to it.As I bought it to use as a pure ebook reader, and got it cheap, I'm satisfied, but don't be fooled into thinking it's a real Pocket PC, it's just not stable enough."
4,Best yet,"Just converted from Palm m505. The Pocket PC OS is excellent, far better than the kludge of Palm OS, Pocket Mirror, and Outlook 2002 that I was using. ActiveSync seems excellent.The PDA itself is also very good so far, nice screen. Microphone is a little scratchy but the audio through an earphone seems fine."
4,Great little PDA,"Very pleased...great deal, great pda. The color screen is crisp and fairly large compared to others. Includes a handy expansion slot for up to 128 ram. Buttons are very usuable and ergonomic...scroll button is wonderful! MP3 player sounds great through headphones and for the price one of the best ones out there. Finding an external keyboard will be a problem since no compatible ones are made so far...all and all good pda. very strongly recommend."
3,Be prepared to call technical support to get going,"I just bought this wonderful device last week and since learned that it will not work with NT so I then updgraded to Windows 2000 just so I can sync with Outlook on my desktop. The directions are horrible and required me to go to the Toshiba website to download the latest drivers and still working on getting it to sync. It seems finicky, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I spent about 2 hours with technical support and they gave up citing that it was proabably the docking station for my laptop. I will continue to try to get it to work. Other than this it seems like a woderful toy and I can't wait to learn about all of its features."
1,Completely Buggy,"First one that I received had a weird issue with the clock running 3 seconds for every real second. Sent that PDA back, got another one, but that would only intermittently sync with my computer. I tried to call technical support, but they were a complete waste of time. Setting up a PDA shouldn't be a huge ordeal, and if you do run into problem, you should have a right to expect customer support to at least be somewhat helpful. Very disappointing as I have two Toshiba laptops - but I will never buy a Toshiba product again if this exemplifies their product and product support."
2,Decent PDA but could do better,"First off, if you have a Mac, don't even look at PocketPC's for a PDA. The e310 is a decent PDA but it lacks the ease of the Palm OS. For instance, the active sync that is used to sync the 310 with the computer stopped working at random. This is despite downloading the newest version of the software and uninstalling and reinstalling the software. The e310 is too much like a PC it crashes too often and requires the use of a hard reboot. Plus the battery life is very short. I needed to charge it every night and that was only with a few hours of use. I'd recommend going with the newest IPaq that allows the battery to be switched out, or a Palm OS PDA (the OS is more stable and battery life is better)."
4,Great,"I bought this pda in lieu of my old m130 which I was not quite satisfied due its speed. Anyway, the toshiba e310 is a great machine with its size and price. Though I'll be missing the bluetooth for awhile that is the reason why I gave a four but certainly I'm satisfied, I have my pocket bible, procad, image viewer all running on the same device, and I never encountered any crushed, power along well I always have my sync charger with me all the time and my external battery."
4,Not Bad!,"My first PDA, I've had it for a couple of weeks.Synchronizes well. Small and light. I am quite happy.I wish there were more add-ons for it like a keyboardand a WiFi networking card. But I guess that's what alaptop is for!"
5,All I need and more!,"I've owned my E310 for a week now.The software that I purchased and installed are:1. Code Wallet2. Agenda Fusion3. Point Start4. Rapid Calc5. Pocket SlideshowI also purchased the 128M SD card and the EB leather case (see below for web site address).The basic software that comes with the E310 works fine. After I installed the software mentioned above, it has made my job much easier. Since I'm in the military I keep documents of (duty roster, alert roster, leaders book, slide presentations) available on my PocketPC. Military personnel know what I mean (HOOAH)! Syncing of all my work/info between my office computer and E310 works fine. Overall I couldn't be more happier with my E310.http://www.ebcases.com/StoreFront.bok"
4,Better than I thought...,"I bought the Toshiba e310, after doing a lot of reviewing and I think it offers just the right package for anyone who is getting into the PDA world, but I must say this PDA lacks something that should be pointed out. Although it has a SD port, and you can expand the memory capabilities of the unit, there is no way to put a modem to it, besides the bluetooth card. Except that, this PDA is great. It has all you need, including Adobe Acrobat Reader for Pocket PC, that from my point of view, is a must when you handle information. If your budget is not to high to buy a Compaq or HP PDA, my suggestion is to buy it right now, I think it is the right choice that covers cheap and functional"
2,"Great PDA, But Lacks Keyboard Accessory","Both my wife and I bought the Toshiba e310 shortly after its release. At that point, Toshiba and Belkin, and perhaps others, were saying that a keyboard was in the works. At this point, a keyboard still has not been released, and it seems doubtful that one will.Toshiba did a poor job in this area, in my opinion. If I were purchasing a PDA now, I'd probably buy the new Dell PDAs. They're doing it right -- you can order their keyboards along with the PDA. Dell is also going to bring the price of PDAs down, it seems. Other than that, though, we've had an excellent experience with the PDA. We're not the kind of people to waste money on every new PDA that comes along, so we'll probably use these for several years, we hope, although we'd really like to have a portable, folding keyboard."
1,Very disappointed,"If it's not too late, I'm going to try and cancel my order. And I was SO looking forward to this PDA. It's not compatible with NT. Or Windows 95. I had to read that little fact in another reviewer's comments in this forum - I didn't see it anywhere in the technical specs. A call to toshiba support confirms it. So that means I'll either have to buy a new computer to sych it at home or do without synching since I don't imagine I can get my entire firm to change operating systems just because I bought a new PDA. Rats."
5,Para los hispanos,"es mi primera pocket pc, pero por su precio y los rebates que ofrecen uff tengo para rato, me sincronizo con avant go y tengo las noticias de mi pais y todo el mundo a diario, hago cartas, hojas de calculo, mis contactos, mi musica, mis cuentas por pagar y cobrar, mi agenda, etc, es mi secretaria pues me avisa cuando tengo reuniones, es excelente se las recomiendo, completamente configurable, manuales entendibles la resolucion super buenisima, los controles posee tres el lapiz, un boton de navegacion y otro en la parte superior usa el que quieras que de igual forma funcionan, la conectividac con tu desktop, internet, impresoras, todo facil de usar, ella hace todo el proceso de instalacion, es un buen producto a un excelente precio."
1,Pointless,"There is absolutely no point - now that there are palmtops on the market that are far more functional - in a handheld that requires the use of a dinky little stylus and a specialized writing method to enter characters, and has a tiny little display window unsuited for any long form text.Not to mention that it has an MS operating system, which I have some philosophical problems with."
4,Suprisingly cool,"Have been using it for a couple months now. It's just about everything you'd want in a handheld and fast. Operating system (microsof) takes a little gettting use to, had some issues trying to organize my shortcuts for apps. Overall though I am really pleased and impressed. Kicks my old PalmIIIe's butt with a much better interface, but that's not really a fair comparison.Price is a bargin!"
1,Bad Choice,My E310 is a piece of junk. I have sent the thing back twice and it comes back in the same condition. The company will not give me a replacement or my money back. I will never buy another product from Toshiba. I have never been able to charge the battery up to 100% even after 24 hours. There is a distinctive line that runs across the screen. I send it in for repair and it comes back the same way
5,Bang for the Buck!,"I used to use a Palm IIIxe.I *used to* strain to read tiny type on a screen that had little contrast. I *used to* wish I could write on the thing without dealing with GRAFFITI.Now, I look at a bright, vibrant screen. I write on the screen like I would write on paper and watch the e310 suck in my text *fairly reliably,* unless I revert to my sloppy-handwriting self. Sure beats dealing with one letter-at-a-time graffiti.Now I can record voice notes, playback music, and use the thing almost constantly. My Palm had been sitting for a while and only used when I went traveling.I bought the 64-MB SD card to boost the memory, but have yet to put it in. In fact, I have yet to use more than half of the installed RAM.This little puppy is one of the best gadgets I've evr used. Everyone around me is still plinking through their Palm screens, and I don't envy them one bit. The two or three Palm owners that looked at it have said they would have bought the same thing if it were out back then."
5,"Small screen, big value","Does everything big PC does. Only problem is without full keyboard data entry is much, much slower. That problem still needs to be dealt with."
1,Light weight is the only good quality!!,"I own this pocket pc for less than two years; it already gives up on me. System freezes, unusable every time it powers up, update the ROM and it still won't work. (It only works when I reset it). I did regret from buying it ever since I got it. It has little memory storage and eats battery like crazy. No second charger where you can take it with you when travel, and no user replaceable battery. In my case I didn't need this replaceable battery thing, because it stops working before the battery life stops. Only good quality about it is its light weight! I didn't want to criticized, but I had enough! People said it has good display, and it looks nice. When it compared next to my co-worker's HP iPAQ, this looks like a peace of junk, then again, I only paid $250.00 for it at that time."
1,Unreliable product and poor Toshiba support,"I would not recommend purchasing this product. The main reason is that Toshiba does not back their product beyond the warranty. Within six months of purchasing this PDA, it crashed three times and the company will not replace the product or refund my money. The will simply repair the item. Considering the situation, I don't feel this is appropriate."
4,problem with accidently turning on recorder,Easy to use. The only problem is that when you take it out of the holder you almost always will hit the record button. I can't believe that they did not notice that when making the product. It can be a real pain because you have to shut the recorder off each time. The only way to get it out is to grab at the top and then you get finger prints on the screen. My first experience with a pda and I am happy with it otherwise
5,A must for touch screens,"I used a Palm T5 for several years without a screen protector, and it is still going strong. However, the screen does show wear with abrasions from use and abuse. This purchase allowed me to protect the screen of my new Palm Treo as well preserve the life of my T5, which still works great and stores all my audiobooks. Take extra care when putting these things on, though. Cut them accurately to fit your screen and make sure you get them on perfectly smooth on your first try. If you do, you will forget they are there and protect your screen wonderfully."
1,"Stay Away...waste of $$$ - (USB 1.1 only, very slow)","This unit looks new. Looks like a new design. But it's a waste of your money. It's only a USB 1.1 (ie: 12mbs transfer speed) versus the long standard USB 2.0 (ie: 480 mbs).Worse, it's not even priced at USB 1.x device prices (ie: < $5).:("
4,Something's Missing,"The product in and of itself is fine. However, there is a reference to a DC Power Supply that is required if a user wants to daisey-chain or add devices that require power. I cannot find this power supply. The product code is USBHUB4CP. I went to the Linksys site, and they don't have it either. Is this power supply ""vaporware""? What's the story?"
5,Nice Hub,"This is a very good, very simple to use USB hub. It is a USB 1.0 or 1.1 only, so it is pretty cheap. The cord is not too long and not too short, just as long as it is in the picture."
3,"Tiny and cheap, but be sure to get the separate power supply","Tiny, inexpensive, basic USB hub. Check, however, to make sure all your USB peripherals draw very little power, otherwise you will need to buy the separate power supply as well."
3,It's an unpowered hub,"Since this hub draws power frm the computer bus, it will be sharing the 500 mhz of one USB power over the 4 ports it allows. On high-power devices such as scanners, printers, cameras, video capture, etc... this hub will not be able to support multiple devices of this kind.It's fine for USB input devices (mice, keyboards, joysticks, etc). Nive form factor and price."
5,GREAT LITTLE DEVICE,"After searching, I found that this hub is what I need. It doesn't need a power supply. My Scaner which gets its power from the PC , works great. all my other devices that use USB works great too. It has a little power on light. This hub is small but works as it should. I recommend it to everyone. The size of the cord is not a problem, It is as if your computer had four more ports at the back. I think you could not find another hub at this price.PEACE."
4,Gets the job done!,I am using this USB hub to connect 3 printers to an Airport to print over WiFi and it's working just fine!
1,$18 down the drain,"Does not support usb powered high-speed devices such as USB 2 external hard drives, scanners, etc. In the case of my Maxtor external hard drive, a pop-up warning comes up that advises you that the drive will operate at slower speed. In fact, the drive operated so slowly as to be useless. No external power supply is available anywhere for this USB hub. Should be either pulled from Amazon or the cover blurb should state that no AC power supply is available (and that without it this unit is useless unless you are just connecting keyboards, mice, and the like.) I will probably just trash it, not worth the trouble to return."
5,Great product,Add 4 USB ports quickly and hassle-free; just plug it in and the extra ports are instantly there. Works great!
2,NO POWER SUPPLY,"This nifty little USB Hub does *NOT* come with the power supply made for it, NEITHER can you purchase it from Linksys. After having called Linksys, they informed me that they are phasing out this product. If you plan to run USB devices off this hub that require little to no power, this product is great. I can hook up my mouse, printer, and USB Flash drive, but if you want to use, for example, a Wireless USB Card on this hub, IT WILL NOT WORK."
4,Good propuct,"A good solid USB hub, I have no complaints. Note that it does not come with a power supply, and therefore will get all of it's power from the computer. this means that it may run out of power if you attach something with high power requirements like a floppy drive or hard disk. you can order a power supply for it seperately, the users manual has a part number. using the adapter will also help with laptop battery life."
5,Great little hub for the price!,I bought this little guy so I could plug my Palm Tungsten T2 and 128 Megabyte Flash Drive on my DELL L400's single USB port. Works great! I did not have to install an external power supply for the Linksys four port hub. The cost/benefit ratio and quality is excellent. That is why I give it five stars.
4,Be aware that it is USB 1.1 only,"It works well, but be aware that it is USB 1.1 only. I am not using it for my Epson RX620 scanner/printer, which is USB 2.0"
1,Doesn't work,I tried to use the USB hub by Linksys and when I did the screen would freeze or my track ball orkeyboard would not work properly. They work fine when disconnected from hub. I am using withWindows XP Professional on a Dell laptop. I called Linksys and was on hold for 25 minutes. I hung up.Again I called and was on hold for 15 minutes then when they transferred me I was disconnected.
1,defect!!!,The USB port that I received was defected; it almost messed up all my other devices that were connected to the hub.
4,Good USB Hub,Use this to expand the USB capability of an older laptop PC and it does the job. Haven't had any problems with the item.
2,"It works, sort of","I use this product with my laptop which only has one USB port. I have a variety of USB hardware items that I connect to it including a Microsoft Optical mouse, a burner, printer, and a palm handheld. I have a problem with it turning off and on. I often lose the ability to use my mouse because it runs out of power. This is simply because the mouse is drawing power from the USB port, and so are the other hardware items connected to it, which turns out to be too much for it to handle.I would recomend buying a hub with a power adapter. You can buy a power adapter for this, but it's not really worth it."
3,It's OK!,"I just received my Hub two weeks ago, and so far it's been ok. I run Windows XP and plug both my optical mouse and Compaq ipaq into the usb ports. My only issue is that now my laptop wants to load the drivers for one or both device ('s) each time It boots up. It's more of an annoyance than anything. Otherwise the hub works fine.I am curious to know if anyone else is having this issue."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"This is a great unit by adding 4 USB ports to your existing computer. Be aware though that this unit has a short cord so if you have a PC and your USB port is in the front like ours, you may have to get a small extension cord in order that it doesn't fall out of the socket every time you put in, or take out, a peripheral. But the extension cords are very inexpensive and it's well worth the price. It has actually saved me from buying a new computer for the house due to the limited number of USB ports on our present PC. Obviously, there is a male part on the cord, that fits into the USB port of your computer. For someone like me, I needed that in the description to fully understand the workings of the unit. Otherwise, a great buy."
1,I could not use it,I am not very knowledgable about computers. This turned out to be a USB hub and not a USB-2 hub which I required. Also the cord was much to short for my situation since I have no ports on the front of my computer. I gave it to my church rummage sale without opening it. The information was in the ad. I just didn't understand it.
3,Linksys USBHUB4C ProConnect Compact USB 4-Port Hub,"Beware that this is a usb 1.1 hub (slow speed), not 2.0."
3,"Fat and Clunky for ""Compact"", No USB Extension Included.","This has to be the fattest ""compact"" USB adapter I have ever seen. I've had USB hubs that were a 1/4 of the USBHUB4C's size, and got the job done well. AND, those other hubs were FREE after mail-in rebate....It would have been nice if Linksys included an USB ""A"" extension cable with the USBHUB4C, since the cable itself is only about 5"" long. It doesn't really benefit desktop users to have a short, stubby USB hub hanging off the back of the computer. If you have an extension cable, use it.For some reason, the DC power adapter, USBHUB4CP, that you supposedly can purchase separately to turn this USBHUB4C into a powered USB hub, doesn't exist anymore on the web.... So don't count on this hub for any USB device that draws power from the computer itself, unless you can figure out the DC rating for this hub."
2,underwhelmed...,"It has a really short cord - but more annoying is the fact that the on-line description said it was USB 2.0, but upon delivery the package and booklet say it's USB 1.0 and 1.1 - nothing about 2.0."
5,One's man's ceiling is another man's floor,"The warnings may be justified, but this device delivers exactly what I wanted. The short cord is ideal for my laptop setup. The lack of separate power is an asset, since all my USB devices (mouse, keyboard, printer, camera) can draw power from the USB connection itself. That means no additional power cord to snake through to an outlet. My desk appreciates the small form-factor. And of course it delivers the primary benefit of a hub: the necessity of unplugging just a single connection to get the laptop on the road.I do wish Linksys would market an identical-format hub with USB 2.0 speed."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"This is a nice piece of equipment that will promply improve the organization in your desk with three more USB connections for your peripherals.Installing it couldn't be any easier, just hook it up and go.One draw be is that this is a 1.0 USB compliant connector. You might want to consider the new 2.0 standard for faster speeds, and more value for your buck."
4,"nice and compact, but you might end up needing power","it's the perfect size if you need the ports for USB 1.0. be warned, however, that there's a tiny power input jack in the side (you can almost see it in the photo -- the little cutout on the left in the blue), but it doesn't come with a power adapter or any information about what to use. i use an optical mouse, a keyboard, and a webcam without problem, yet i've heard many usb devices need powered USB and there's clearly a jack, so i thought i should mention it."
3,Extension Cord is too short,"I just got this order and try it. I mainly want to use it to hook up a bunch of USB stuff such as Memory Keys in my notebook, which require not a lot of power. This product is Good. With a 250 MB zip driver and several USB memory key, it ran well.However, my Toshiba notebook puts all of the USB head in the back. Thus, for such a USB hub with such a short extention cord, it is really inconvenient for me.My suggestion is: for those person with USB jack behind the computer, this is not a good choice."
1,It simply doesn't perform as it should,It looks nice and is handy but it simply cannot handle two different devices working at the same time!
2,The trick with compaqs & Win 98,"After 2 calls to tech support & 8 hours at the keyboard, I finally figured this out myself. There seems to be a problem with Compaq & Win 98. It finds the driver for the new device on the harddrive, but can't load it. The trick is to check the box that say's ""Skip the file"". It finished loading & now recognizes the device. Still not perfect...it runs my printer & DSL line, but when I add a 3rd device, e.g. a scanner, it knocks the DSL line off. It shouldn't be a power problem. I think all 3 devices have their own power. My solution. Give this hub to someone with a different computer & newer version of Windows & get a Belkin F5U021 4-port hub with optional power adapter included for a few $$ more. It was the same trick with clicking ""Skip the file"" to get it up & running, but it does run 4 devices at a time, including the DSL line."
2,USB,"An OK unit, but only works with USB1; thus unusable with anything remotely new, unless you don't mind waiting interminably for downloads, etc."
4,Short term reliability,"For the time being as I am in the process of purchasing a new computer, the USB device will work for my laptop, taking into consideration the fact that I don't have powered up devices attached to it that would draw from the laptop."
2,Linksys 4-port hub,"The item was a great idea. I bought it for my laptop. However, I quickly found out it was not compatible with my USB 2 system and was in fact only good for 1.1 USB systems. I think the add should have stated that it was 1.1. I bought because it was a ""Compact USB 4-Port Hub"" never realizing that it was not a USB 2.O Hub. I need to pay more attention I guess."
3,This is *not* USB-2.0!,"I bought this hub because of the Linksys name and didn't need a power input. Agree it is kind of chunky, looks pregnant enough to give birth to a USB cable jack!! Please note that if you need USB 2.0 this hub is not compatible. When I plugged in my Fujitsu Scanner I kept getting alerts saying I wasn't getting optimal speed to/from the scanner so I just plugged in my Mouse and Keyboard into the Linksys, and plugged the Fujitsu into a USB port on the PC and all was fine."
5,Problems solved,No more USB connection space troubles. Thanks to this device I can connect more accesories to my PC without losing connectivity.
4,5 stars?,"I only gave it a 4 stars because it does its job and does it well. What else is it suppose to do? Its not great, but a very good item if you need it."
2,Cisco-Linksys USBHUB4C ProConnect Compact USB 4-Port Hub,"I purchased this item as used, shipping was great received a day earlier than told.My only problem it seems I can only use 2 ports at a time, when I need to use three then the other one won't work.So I can say I am disappointed with the item only."
1,Not for Me,"I don't find shooting chickens (or any animals for that matter) fun. I thought there'd be more to it but it's just a ""kill the chickens"" game."
3,Very Amusing,"This game is really cute but there are some tricks that I haven't been able to figure out yet and cannot find any information online or elsewhere that would help.To get the chicken in the car, first shoot up the car. You will shoot the door off, shoot the hood, and then shoot off the grill. Then he won't immediately duck back down. The one in the outhouse can be revealed by shooting the sign in the door (is it a heart?). Listen for the sound of the bees when you are elsewhere. The louder it gets, the more points you will get for shooting that chicken. But, if it gets too loud, you're in trouble. Minus 50 points for getting bee stung. Do not shoot the snail or the white flag or the porcupines! Still haven't figured out the one in the oven. Lost a lot of points trying to though."
5,Geat game...,"We love this game. There are some tricks we've learned. The chicken fishing-if you wait a safe falls for 50 pt. The chick with the pan, after several hits you get 75pt. Shoot the flash cards for pts. The kite is 25pt, hit the falling chick for 50 more. We can't get the chick in the stove. Any ideas. I found ""Revenge of the Chickens"" downloadable only. No disc available. I think it is similar. We also would lower the rating. My 3y/o and 7 y/o love it. There isn't any blood or guts. They just squawk..."
3,NICE BRACELET,"This is a nice bracelet.But,it's not for every wear. I have to take it off when I write."
5,Rocknoceros rocks!,"Not only does my one year old love listening to the music, but so do I! It's a great mix of tunes that keep your toes tapping and child smiling."
4,Rare treat of talent and sensetivity,"Dakota really shows her ability to touch on the sensetive side of being human and alive. Her songs Let Godiva Ride and I never mention have a wonderful weight and fullness to their sound. Princess is a tender ballad that shows her gift for emotion in her music. This CD is an artful blend of rock, blues, and pop. A great debut album. I look forward to hearing her music develop over the years and anxiously await her second album."
4,ojalá y pudiera ir,"La novela está bien, la trama y los caracteres bien dibujados, pero lo que más me impresionó sobre el libro es la descripción de la ciudad de Antigua. La autora hace un retrato de la cuidad tan detallado y con tanto color que es imposible que no le entren a uno ganas de ir. Me encantaría visitar Antigua un día de estos."
5,Vivo y envolvente,"Como mujer chilena la historia me movio, removio y conmovio como pocas hasta ahora. Creo que me ayudo a pensar en muchas cosas de mi propia vida y en mi identidad. Vale la pena, no solo para mujeres, creo que Marcela Serrano tiene algo que decir a todos. No importa si la calidad estrictamente literaria no es tan fantastica (aunque este es el mejor de sus libros), al final, uno no es un academico de la literatura, uno lee para vivir."
4,Collectors review,These books are old in print date but fresh in interest to any new reader they can read over and over with lots of enjoyment I am proud of my little readers and enjoy given them good material to read
5,To Fill The Skies with Pilots,"I needed this book for a research project in a hurry, and I received it promptly and it was in great condition. This book has a fascinating and detailed history."
5,Lang-O-Learn-always a quality product,"As a speech pathologist, I buy lots of language stimulation cards. Lang-O-Learn never disappoints. I've seen stim cards that are blurry, ambiguous and /or so dark you can hardly see the object pictured. Lang-O-Learn stim cards are always bright, clear and precise. This set focuses on farm animals and a few other objects found on the farm I use them for my adults here in rural Central Pa."
5,Early Project of Jeff Johnson,"A contemplative instrumental project that somewhat defies description. Very gentle, soothing and meditative, yet remaining characteristic of aspects of Jeff's work, this project seems a shared venture between him and others he often collaborates with (Sandy Simpson, Dieter Zander, and Kathy McClatchey are co-producers and performers). The music all flows and works together seamlessly, utlizing a shifting cast of instuments and players, some of whom lend contributions to only a song or two. Perhaps a little atypical but also good for that reason."
3,Interesting book with some humor,"This book is nicely written and has a unique point of view for the person moving to Maine. There are some areas of Maine that receive more commentary than other, but what is included is good."
1,Not What is promised - No Multi-player,"This item was made by micoshaft, and Ensemble studios (EOS). EOS was the online multiplayer engine that ran all the fun. Well they went out of business, so Ubisoft is now the ones that are selling the game.When Ubisoft released the game, they shipped every single copy with the same CD KEy, thus making the online multiplayer useless.I called Ubisoft, and they are out of product keys to re-issue, and Microshaft AKA little India, is not covering this game anymore because it is out of their 5 year window of support.Ontop of all this I received the $9.99 jewel case edition that you are debating on buying this one or that one... they are one in the same.IF, and only IF you get the actual product that is pictured above of the Original box will you receive the correct product to get online with, because it will be a unique CD Key... (not included in this product...grrrr)"
1,Identical CD-Keys,"As a previous reviewer posted, the CD-keys that you receive are identical...the main problem, really, is that you don't receive the product you're looking for; you receive the Xplosiv plastic case instead. Watch out for this one. The game seems fantastic, though."
4,Age of Mythology Gold Edition,Age of Mythology Gold Edition is a great fun game. I love it. When I started playing my Mom had to confiscate it because I was playing it too much. It was all I thought about over the course of the first week.
5,Age of Mythology computer game,This is a game where the children actually learn something. My 11 year old daughter and her friends love mythology and this game fits the bill.
2,No Multiplayer.,"Great and fun game, used to have and play all the time. Purchased again due to lost CD and Product key and the Key that was given is not usable for online muliplayer. Very dissapointing"
5,Amazing,"This is an amazing game. It is by far the best game like it, compleatly trumping both age of empires, with its god powers this game rocks my socks. Even the cheats are the best and funniest ever. In what other game can you make exploding methain chickens of doom fall from the sky?"
5,well packed and timely shipping,this is one of my all time favorite series of age of empires.. worke well with windows7 system.. havent tried playing multiplayer yet
2,unable to play multiplayer,"was a huge fan of this game many years ago when released and absolutely love playing online multiplayer, yet i am unable to"
2,does not run on win 7 64bit,"says ""initialization error"" after full install with disk in cd drive. i installed the gold edition with the cd codes provided."
5,FUN!!!!!!,This game is really awesome. The graphics are great and the gameplay is also really good. i definetly reccomend buying this game
1,I am willing to bet ...,"... I'm willing to bet that the folks here who give this movie 5 stars have absolutely no background whatsoever in space travel, physics, astronomy, science, etc. It seems that only the uneducated masses (Sibrel, 5-star reviewers et al.) are ""smart enough"" to uncover this hoax, yet those that are educated with PhDs in any field of science are ""too stupid"" to realize it was all a hoax. Ever heard of Occam's razor? It is highly dubious that so many uneducated folks are so cunning and all the doctors, astronomers, physicists and rocket scientists have been duped all these years. It's the other way around, the uneducated masses have been duped by this movie; the educated can see right though it. Think about it."
1,"Bad science, Dishonest film making","Bart Sibrel asks us to believe that tens of thousands of engineers, scientists, pilots and politicians have engaged in a secret conspiracy for over 30 years. That they lied to Americans and the world about this very important event.Shame on this man, who calls himself a filmmaker. It is far more believable that he is just an opportunist with no sense of honesty and no regard for the honor of documentary film making."
4,Interesting and Funny,My grandmother died and she never believed that the man walked on the moon.It is the first time after this that i hear this theory again in this dvd.I really dont know if all what you will see is scientificslly proven or not but i found it interesting watching it.I am giving it four stars just because it is beyond funny the idea of the theory that the man never walked on the moon is true.
3,A Funny Thing Happened in my VCR,"The footage shown in this video is the same as what I saw on the FOX special report. I'm guessing that this producer repackaged the sources used on Fox with some ""exclusive"" footage. Basically, IF you saw the FOX television special then you got all the basic information about the moon hoax.However... The conclusions drawn in this video and on the Fox Special are seriously flawed. I won't elaborate on details here, but if your seriously interested in this hoax theory visit the enterprise mission website (enterprisemission.com) and look for the ""Who Mourns for Apollo?"" report.I gave three stars because the video was well produced and it blazes a trail to uncover hidden truths, albeit flawed conclusions. The people presenting the hoax theories have every right to be suspicious, and there's a bigger truth out there.. if you care to look"
1,A funny thing happened on the way to the moon,"I was very disappointed in this video. With 47 minutes of play time, this video spent most of it talking about the history of the space program. Any kind of hoax theory that might have made it interesting was only, at the most, 10 minutes. Granted there were a few things that made it interesting but I felt that this tape used the title to sell old NASA footage and avoided the hoax portion."
1,The Most Pathetic Conspiracy Theory Ever,"After the Mythbusters debunked this man's claims and after the LRO actually imaged the Apollo landing sites, down to the footsteps of the astronauts, one can only wonder why this man is taken seriously by anyone."
1,A Hilarious Bad Movie to prove that Apollo was a Hoax,"What fun!! I really laughed at this one. Anything can be faked, especially this video. Anyone heard of Adobe Photoshop? There is also software to change a video in any way. I know because I have videos which I can edit in any way I please. All is needed is the equipment and the software. Everyone is discussing shadows and the like. Has anyone heard of physics and the properties of light? There once was a smart cookie named Albert Einstein who gave all of mankind a great deal of knowledge about our universe.None of these so-called ""Movie Makers"" have the slightest knowledge of mathematics, either.Would you really argue physics with the village idiots?I am an Apollo veteran.I have Honors Degrees in Mathematics and Astronomy."
4,A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon.,This video is a great way to teach the fallacies of reason. It helps students to think through their initial reactions to drawing a logical conclusion.
5,awesome movie,"this films explains precisely how and why we faked the moon landing in great detail.showing the us governmnet to be liars they break down the walls of this big lie one by one, youve got to see it to believe it."
1,Bad science at it's worst,You will never find a greater collection of bad science and outright lies than in this documentary. Shadows converging? Even my 12 year old figured out the reason for that but here in this documentary the makers couldn't. No stars in the pictures on the moon? Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out either but here it's presented as proof of the moon landings being a hoax. Even their statement at the beginning of the documentary that states that 25% of the people in the US (based on a poll by Gallup) believe the moon landings are a hoax is not correct. Gallup has the poll on their website. The correct number was only 4% and you will find more than that believe Elvis is alive probably. Nothing but bad science and distortion. Hard to believe anyone with even the most basic understanding of science could swallow this fairy tale.
1,are you kidding me?,What a joke. So many holes in his theories that he states as fact. Chooses to ignore info that doesnt agree with his money making scheem.Glad buzz punched this dude
5,Excellent piece of work !!,"Did the people who wrote these reviews here on this page see the same documentary that I did ? ... It was an amazing, insightful and extremely well researched documentary and I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in finding out the truth about the Apollo moon hoax ... Wake up people , and recognize the truth when you see it . ... The looks on the faces of the Apollo astroNOT'S said it all , in this film ... And the NASA footage is the SMOKING GUN PROOF that the missions were nothing more than a huge scam !! ... To quote Neil Armstrong .. "" Ask me no questions and I will tell you no lies"" , says it all also ."
4,"we didnt land on the moon, come on now","I was just wondering if we landed on the moon 34 years ago, why havent we or any other country for that matter ever go there again. I mean we go into space to hatch chicken eggs, come on we would be up there taking samples or something!"
1,Fun For The Feeble-Minded,"Complete and utter paranoid nonsense. Total disregard for scientific facts. Then again, stupidity is its own punishment."
1,If there were a 0 star it'd get that!,"I actually did a fairly extensive year long research project specifically on the idea of a moon hoax. I went in thinking a hoax was possible, however after this DVD, I relaized the money I had wasted. This DVD is for the stupid fool who will believe anything he/she hears. Spend your money on capricorn one and something else entertaining. And Mr. Sibrel is full of himself. There isn't any amazing footage, actually, hes clearly in it for the money..."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this title. My advise is to save your money. The documentary spends a lot of time covering the events of the 1960s instead of the so called evidence. I found the Fox special more compelling. I am still undecided about whether we went to the moon or not. This DVD did not convince me. The Fox special at least got me thinking about the possibility.
1,Worthless RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Nice Basement work. Video students could do a better job of editing. Provides no real proof. If this piece of crap was at all valid Bart would have disappeared long ago or been shot. This is man is a greedy head case who JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY by making accusations on a poor video. Very dissapointing. Really wish he provided real evidence. I guess some people really WANT to beLIEve. Seriously do people really even care is we went to the moon? I mean seriously!
1,Men DID walk on the moon!,"This movie is complete garbage. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because you can't give it zero stars!Every single piece of ""evidence"" that the moon landings were faked can be easily proven wrong. These hoax theories only distort history, and anyone with a brain knows the moon landings really happened. If the photos taken on the moon show proof the landings were faked then why does NASA still provide the photos free on their websites? If they had proof of a hoax the photos would have been destroyed, not posted on the web for the world to see."
4,How did they return?,"I find it questionable whether there is really any need for a documentary proving that NASA never sent men to the moon. Even if they had managed to reach the moon alive, it would have been an engineering miracle for them to have succeeded in leaving the moon's surface and returning to Earth. Actually, to say it was an engineering 'miracle' is being too generous. It was an engineering impossibility and it simply did not happen."
2,Not as good as it appears.,I bought this to seal a leak in some flashing. It did not work. It was easy to apply and the directions were clear.
3,leak sealer,was not as I expected with a whit cap the spray was clear and very thin liquid does not work on veritable surfaces
1,This product is a complete scam,"I am not sure where those four and five star ratings came from, other than maybe company insiders. The product simply does not work wet or dry. It is about as effective as paint. If you do a google search, pretty much every review of the product will testify to the same thing. To have it rated a 4 star on Amazon smells of sharp practice. Do not buy."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,I feel really stupid for wasting my money on this product. First of all there product description lead me to think I was getting a case (read it above) Then when one can arrived I contacted the seller two times through the link on amazon. They failed to respond. I let it go and chalked it up to a lesson learned. Then when my son was going to put it on a kitchen sink trap the agitator inside the can was stuck and nothing would come out of the can. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. The seller will not get back with you if there's a problem. Actually it was Product Features not Product description that lead me to think it was a case. They have changed this and its not there anymore but I have the screen capture printed and it was misleading.
3,Not happy with the product,It was delivered in the time it was suppose to. The product cloged in use and was only able to use half the can before it stopped spraying. Paid way to much for such a small amount.
1,No Pressure,After one use the spray stopped working. I have nearly a whole can of useless sealant. Too bad the sealant worked on the can it came in!
5,Awesome,"I tried to find this in my local mega warehouse home improvement place and they do not have anything like it. One application worked great. This is my second can. The first time I had a leak in an addition onto the house between the new roof and the wall. I tried to seal it with the pitch like substance but I still had a small leak. This sealed it great. No problem for 3 years, even with the hurricanes here in Florida! This time I had a leak in my pool filter housing that was causing water to shoot out of a small crack in the plastic. I sprayed it twice, waiting about an hour and have had no problem for over a month. This can saved me a couple of hundred dollars. Great product, lots of uses"
1,This stuff is worthless,Tried this on a small leak under my sink drainer. Did nothing...very much like spray paint...no leak sealer at all and chipped off within 2 days. Do not buy!!
5,"Hearts Divided: 5-B Poppy Lane, etc. - Debbie Macomber",Debbie Macomber is a wonderful writer of love stories. You can tell she knows her stuff. She travels to various cities/states to get a feel of the places she writes about. I have read almost 100 of her books & loved every one of them. Her series are my favorites - such as her Blossom Street series & her Cedar Cove series. 5-B Poppy Lane is part of her Cedar Cove series.
3,Another Winner,"As always Debbie Macomber comes through with another heart-warming, enjoyable journey into life. Although the ideas for her books may come from various friends, acquaintances or conscientious flashes, the end result always seems to make life through Debbie's characters something to cherish."
5,Excellent BOOK!,I read it all in one sitting. I couldn't even take a bathroom break :) I highly recommend.
3,Hearts Divided,"*** In this sweet little story collection, past and present are bridged by a common thread of love and revealed secrets. Granddaughters learn lessons about love from their grandmothers' recollections of the past, of loves they had in the WW II era. The stories are connected by email messages between the three grandmothers, but they do have a common theme. Debbie Macomber's entry that opens the anthology is the strongest of the three, however, each one is a sweet, safe read for book lovers of all ages to enjoy. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,Not bad...,"Of the three stories, I enjoyed the one by Katherine Stone the best. It was very sweet and the characters were cute. The bit about the grandmother's eyesight seemed sort of random, though... kind of like the author wanted to just throw in some information that people should know about cataracts.The story by Debbie Macomber sort of seemed... a little dated, I guess. As I read it, I sort of wondered if it had been written years ago and was being republished, with a few updates to accomodate for technological advances (cell phones, email). It was just an impression I got from the characters, I think.I have no real complains about the Lois Faye Dyer story. It was fine.All in all, an okay book, but not a keeper."
3,I was a bit disappointed in this one...,"The first part of the book that Debbie Macomber wrote was great, but the two that followed by two other authors were not as good. They were ok and the story lines were good, but their style of writing was not as good as Debbie's. It is really obvious in the second story that you are no longer in Macomber land."
2,Scam.,"I feel cheated. The image of the 4oz package looks exactly the same as a 12oz package on the monitor screen. Nowhere do they tell you its a 4 oz package & if they perchance do, its hidden or obscure. Im not a happy customer. I feel Ive been ripped off."
4,"it's good, except","When I got it, the dvd was an LCD, and it didn't have the music video's on it which I thought it would."
3,she looks better than she sings,"And I was hoping she was a lot better looking. I read a few reviews of her figuring that since she's supposedly super popular her cds would be decent.One or two catchy songs, but that's it. Her singing is mediocre, at best."
4,Irene Iddesleigh,Long flowery sentences that go on forever! A fun book that I donated to my public Library. Be prepared for sensory overload!
3,Unbalanced,"Trash can did not fit close to wall due to a protrusion on the lid's back. The trash can bottom was not equipped to secure its balance, when opening and closing."
5,Worth the price,"I had a $50 coupon, so the cost was not as great, but after receiving the trash can, I would have paid full price for it. It looks nice. The lid works great. The band around the top and the bag holder are a tremendous asset. The white color is much better than the stainless ones that leave fingerprints. This was a very good choice."
4,Expensive but works well,"I like the hands-free design. The linkage between the foot pedal and the lid seems a little loose (and a bit flimsy) but works ok so far. The trash can has a thin metal exterior with a plastic inner liner that you can pull out to dump the trash. We use tall kitchen trash bags with tie ends and it's a little awkward getting them installed so the tie ends don't hang outside the can. Might try the bags with draw strings and see if that helps. Item arrived in excellent condition. For the price, I expect this trash can to last AT LEAST ten years. Anything less than that and I won't be sending hugs & kisses to OXO."
2,Not worth $$$.$$.,"My wife & I purchased the OXO almost two years ago; we have used and maintained it with extraordinary care. It was our hope that it was well constructed and with proper use & care, the Can would last for some time. Not the case, a couple of weeks ago, the foot control opener mechanism, which is partially constructed of plastic, with a metal rod, broke (small black bar)after nearly two years...we now have to open can by hand. We purchased the OXO because it was purportedly well-made and would last at least five (5) years...unfortunately, this has not been the case. We are disappointed and feel it simply was not worth the price. Certainly in this case OXO did not live up to its reputation as a quality product. We're appealing for a replacement because we feel strongly that OXO ought to stand behind its product! Disappointed reired MD & spouse!!!(:)"
1,Still Broke Despite High Price,"I looked for a trash can forever. Silly, I know, but I wanted something simple, big and not stainless steel. I figured spending this much money for a trash can would mean it wouldn't break like my last step trash can. Nope! Broken. We've had it for 6 months and now the step won't work. Now I feel much sillier. I think the main problem with the construction is that part of the hinge, the most crucial part of the whole trash can, is made of plastic. Should I spring for a higher-end trash can again I'll go a step further and get what I really wanted, a biohazard step trash can."
3,Sponges pretty good,"When I first bought these sponges, my logic was that they were the same price as shipping, so hey, why not?The sponges arrived, and were pretty big, and had a shape so you could cover a lot of area (like on your cheeks), or be exact (like around your eyes), and were pretty soft.There are some downsides, however. For one thing, foundation stains them (though I find this to be true of all cometic sponges). The package suggests wetting the sponges before use, but they fill with water, and once wrung loose shape to a squished form. I've also found that after washing the sponges and leaving them to dry over night, they sometimes do not regain their shape.Overall, I like the sponges, because they are better than the maybelline sponges I have bought commercially, and I would reccomend them. If, however, you do not have a problem with the sponges you currently use, you may be best off with them."
1,Ridiculously overpriced,"I had to include something to get free shipping and I needed makeup sponges. That's my excuse for spending $6 for these. I'd heard good things about Alison Raffaele and assumed these would be very high quality. Instead, I received two sponges in an unsealed plastic bag [only marked with a UPC code.] These are equivalent to the sponges one can buy at CVS or Walgreen's, in a 30-count bag for $1.59."
2,Flimsy,"These arrived looking like someone had sat on them for a few hours. They were not poorly packed. They are flimsy and insubstantial and do not hold their form well. They squish down to almost nothing when used to apply foundation. I strongly recommend another brand of makeup sponge, this one being the worst I've ever used."
2,Disappointed in this one,"I've heard such great things about Duck tape and the Duck dispensers. So when my trusty tape dispenser broke, I decided to give it a try. First of all the little metal thing that holds the tape in place is too narrow. It is also too loose. More often than not, when I slice the tape, it just slides all the way off and I then have to peel it off the roll. If I don't use it for a few days, the tape adheres so tightly to the little metal thing that I have to peel it off by hand -- can't make it slide. So, this was a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it if you want ease of use. Next time I'm in the hardware store or Costco, I'll be replacing it with something of more industrial strength."
3,good gun,The resonse to a question I had was prompt and clear. The tape gun works fine for a basic model.
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased these last year and loved them, until they broke at the bridge. I returned them to MJ for repair and they stated it would be $65 to repair. When I asked why, they stated that Amazon was not an authorized seller of MJ sunglasses. I did not choose to pay the repair fee and will never buy sunglasses from MJ or Amazon again. A very disappointed customer."
4,"Maui Jim Ka'anapali Sunglasses...Hot Rays, Cool Sunglasses","Living is South Florida demands the use of high quality UV eye protection. These glasses are so light weight, I sometimes forget they are on. The construction uses a super elastic Nickel Titanium (NiTi) frame which can not be bent of deformed out of shape and high impact plastic lens. The bronze color looks great as well. Maui Jim did a nice job on the size, fit, shape and feel for these glasses."
4,He loved them!,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves them and says they are very comfortable and they look great. The only complaint is that he cannot put them on and take them off with one hand as they are wrap around. He is very loyal to Maui Jim, would never buy another brand of sunglasses."
4,Great Travel toy,I take my 3 year old daughter on the road with me a lot for work. This and the other Match box pop up sets have been lifesavers. It isn't a terribly complicated toy and therefore requires her to use her imagination for most of her play. It packs up fairly easily and is compact and easy to travel with. Great summer trip toy to entertain kids in an otherwise boring hotel room!
5,Superb jazz guitar,"This 2-cd set is a bargain. Fox is a tremendous player in the traditional groove, and this set includes a solo cd and a cd with a back-up band. Not surprisingly, the solo cd is more challenging, including a virtuoso ""Caravan."" The cd with the band includes original material, which holds up well. If you like players like Joe Pass, Frank Vignola, and Jimmy Bruno, you will appreciate Mimi Fox."
5,Beautiful and masterful playing all the way!,I play jazz guitar as a hobby and have an instructional DVD by Mimi. On these sets she shows to the world how great a musician she is. The missing link between Joe Pass and Kenny Burrell!
4,11th edition of the collection,This collection includes an episode by episode guide to the Original Series.
4,Simplicity Volume 7: Woodwinds,I think it is a very soothing and relaxing. When I first heard it I couldn't believe it was hymns. I would reccommend this to anyone that enjoys calming instrumental music.
5,My favorite Corrs album,"This is my favourite Corrs album. Everything else from the Corrs has paled in comparison to the lively atmosphere that exudes from this recording. The Corrs has a wonderful synergy with the audience in this album, their MTV Unplugged recording of ""Toss a feather"" is still the best recording they ever did on this track."
5,Unplugged,"Aside from ""The Corrs - Live from Geneva"" concert, the ""Unplugged"" concert is my favorite Corrs' concert, and I own five of their concerts. It is an up close and personal concert with excellent sound and a wonderful back-up orchestra. Like ""The Corrs - Live at Lansdowne Road"", it is a European (Region 2) DVD, which will not play on most American DVD players. It can be played on a laptop computer, however. If you like the music The Corrs used to make, you'll enjoy this DVD, and wish the group would make a comeback for it's many fans around the world."
4,A terrific start for a new author,"I read this book when it first came out a few years ago and liked it immensely. The characters are heartwarming and the story is so enjoyable. As a Regency romance, this book flows easily and the only bad thing about it is how quickly it ends."
4,Very valuable but don't buy it first,"I enjoyed this book and was very informed by it. I doubt you can find more detailed background data about Lucille Ball's work (from the beginning of her career to the end, from stage to the big and small screens) and her (lesser known) co-stars and co-workers anywhere else. The problem is, I'm a new fan to Lucy and I wanted to read about her life in a more conventional way (where she was born, raised, her influences, her marriage, children, etc). Those types of books got such mixed reviews from fans that I thought I'd start with this one, which had only positive reviews. There is some basic bio in this book, but it assumes you know that type of information about Lucy. So I would just say: make sure you don't start with this book if you're a new fan. It's like getting to know her backwards (everyone around her instead of the star herself). This is definitely a book for seasoned fans who want to know ""more."""
5,Fantasy at its best,"Anyone who loves cats and reads Tolkien, LeGuin, Rowlings, McKillip etc. will love this book."
5,Still great music after all the years.,"This CD, from almost a decade ago, is one of Elton John's more progressive and outgoing works. He still has the vocals and stamina to keep going after all these years. I recommend it to anyone who has listened to his music."
4,A Great Album from a Great Artist,"""Songs from the West Coast"" is by far one of Elton's strongest efforts within the last 10 years. It is great to hear Nigel Olsson again. His drumming style blends so well with Elton's songs as exemplified by the album opener ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" and ""I Want Love"". One has to wonder why Nigel wasn't featured on drums on the entire album.The lyrics on the entire album are particulary strong. I hope Bernie Taupin is not as sad as some of the songs he writes. ""Look Ma, No Hands"", ""Dark Diamond"", ""I Want Love"" and ""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore"" cover a lot of emotional ground. While the beautiful melodies and vocals of ""American Triangle"" and ""Ballad of the Boy In the Red Shoes"" prove to be great vehicles to provide some insightful social commentary. Elton's vocals and piano playing are GREAT throughout the entire album. The hardwork of the solo tours paid off! Elton John and this album deserve the critical claim."
2,Disappointing,"Having read reviews along the lines of ""Elton seems to have rediscovered his passion for making rock music,"" I was disappointed to find here only twelve more of the middle-tempo, unexciting, run-of-the mill songs Elton has been churning out for the past 10 years. There is no bigger fan of 1969-1984 Elton John than me, but this album is just further proof that this former genius has run out of ideas. Gosh I hate to say that, but I'm afraid it's true."
2,definitely overrated,"It's too bad Elton chose to sing these songs in his mannered, annoying TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION-era singing style. That ruins it for me."
2,Elton Comes Out.....And Strikes Out !,"In my opinion this has got to be Elton John's worst effort to date, and trust me when I say that I had hoped that this cd was going to be one of his best. In reading the lyrics to the songs which are in the cover insert, I found that most of the selections on this cd pertain to the struggles of being gay, and we are left with a rather depressing cd. Elton John's past efforts have been extremely memorable, and either bouncy or beautiful, this time we are faced with melodies that are very forgetful, and very bland. Elton should have taken a couple of uppers before recording this cd, then perhaps we would at least have a couple of songs that were danceable. I absolutely will not recommend this cd to any of my friends, and would like to warn you beforehand that this is not the Elton John we all love listening to."
3,review t.b.d.,"I'm just guessing on the rating. I haven't bought this cd YET, I need some advice. I'm 38 years old, and haven't bought an Elton cd since 'Rock of the Westies'. The other ones I have - 'Goodbye', 'Tumbleweed', 'Madman', 'Honky', and 'Captain', are absolute jewels to me which I still play regularly. Unfortunately everything Elton has done since then has been disappointing, with boring lyrics, little musicality, and monotonous vocals. I want so badly to buy this album, but ONLY if it is up to my standards. Maybe I want to relive the best decade of all, the seventies! But buying a cd today is a big thing for me, because most of it is garbage (but we won't go into that now), so those who read this should help me to make a decision. No fans of MTV, rap, or Britney need respond. Thanks in advance!"
5,The best so far,Songs from the West Coast is definately the best Elton John Album to come along in quite a while. He has gone back to a sound that he had back in the late 70's. His voice sounds better than ever and it's great to hear more piano. Highly recommended for anyone - a must have for Elton fans.
5,Best Elton since the 70's..,"From the openning cut, the cynical ""Emperor's new clothes"" to the final This Train - this is a great album - every cut is interesting and well done. American Triangle is a moving song about the Matthew Sheapard tragedy. Both Original Sin and I Want Love are those Elton songs that grow on you - as you realize they are great tunes (like The One - they are songs that initially sound slow, but become infectious real quick"
4,Elton Turns Best Album in 10 years,"""Songs From The West Coast"" is honestly Elton's best album in a long time. It seems that he has gotten back to his roots, and his songwriting has reaped the benefits. If you're a big Elton fan, you should really enjoy this album."
4,This Train Don't Stop,"On this 'record' Elton finally returns to the sound that made him a superstar in the first place. Primarily Voice, Piano and Band. Hints of Tumbleweed Connection, great songs, and most of important of all the production. Oh what a relief to hear an Elton John album that isn't completely ruined by being over-produced, like so many were in the 80's and 90's.The only weak track for me is 'The Wasteland' which just sounds like a bit of a filler. However, one track sums this album up for me, and its ""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore"". This is the best single track Elton has recorded since the 70's in my opinion, and certainly in my top 10. This track would be worthy of a place on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, or Honky Chateau.From what I have read recently 'The Captain and The Kid' may also be a return to 70's form for Elton. If it matches this one I'll be buying it."
4,My first Elton John CD,"I have listened to Elton's music for a long time and thought it was time to add him to my collection. My best friend loves him and his music. I was dancing around the kitchen while I cooked to one of his songs and heard him say ""Wyoming"" and of course I was thrilled. FINALLY, I listened to the words and just started crying. I live in Wyoming and when I realized he had written a song about one of our own, Mathew Shepard, it touched my heart. I think he has an amazing sensitivity about life and writes music to the hearts of many."
3,Yes and No,"The publicity machine is touting a return to early 70's form on Elton John's thirtysomething release, Songs from the West Coast. Well, yes and no. The highlights here, nearly consummate with John's earlier work, certainly bring to mind the earthy piano rolls and soul searching beauty of Honky Chateau or Madman Across the Water. ""Dark Diamond"", ""Original Sin"", ""Love Her Like Me"", and ""Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes"" are all fine additions to the canon. ""Birds"" nearly withstands it's insipid lyric. Otherwise, it's business as usual, with Bernie Taupin's hamfisted conceits sabotaging EJ's grand melodies at every turn, nowhere more embarrassingly than on the Matthew Shepard tribute ""American Triangle"". Taupin does get it exactly right on the opening cut, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" (which could also be an apt title for this review)."
5,"""Songs from the West"" are the BEST!!!","EJ has done it again!! This one's a delightful 'deja vu!!'... a trip down memory lane...the past, revisited...all that, and MORE!!! I have to say that for me? This CD runs a close neck and neck with ""Captain Fantastic."" In fact, much of ""Songs from the West Coast"" reminds the listener of a ride with the Brown Dirt Cowboy!! KUDOS to Elton...you are truly ""MUSIC to my ears!"" Thank you for the sentimental journey."
5,Just Keeps Getting Better,"I've never really been disappointed since I bought my first Elton John album nearly 30 years ago. Some have been better than others, the styles have varied, but ""Songs From the West Coast"" is just a gem. ""Original Sin"" will be a classic. The piano based melodies and clean production are superb. Elton is allowed to sing with his voice and piano without production modifications. ""Wasteland"" is one of the songs you can crank up the radio with. Other songs make you think about the world we live in, and how we can perhaps make it better. You can't lose purchasing this album, great song after song."
5,What a way to go out!,"I am one of many who are a big fan of most of Elton John's '70s songs, luke-warm on some of the '80s material, and downright wary of some of the '90s overproduced, ""movie love song"" stuff. Well, with this apparent final album of his long and illustrious career (as he himself announced at a recent concert), Sir Elton has very much returned to a sound that made him a legend in the first place. This piano-heavy effort truly does recall Elton in his prime in many spots. The first single, ""I Want Love"", is only an average track on the album (and it's still a great track). Check out such tracks as ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ""Dark Diamond"", and ""The Wasteland"" for examples of vintage Elton. Also check out the powerful message in the sad song ""American Triangle"". In fact, I don't think that there is a weak track on the album, and the songs flow together very well. Definitely a recommended purchase for long-time fans of this all-time-great performer."
4,Just getting better,"Good old Elton is back, and this time stronger than ever. I hesitated between giving this album four or five stars, and I tend to say four is not enough, but then, this is Elton John, one the most ingenius singer-song-writers with BT of all time, and hence the standard has to be set always a little higher...Excellent collection: Emperors New Clothes, Dark Diamond, Look Ma no Hands, Birds, I Want Love, Red Shoes (the ""Rocket Man"", ""Nikita"" or ""Daniel"" of all Elton songs) etc... There is no filler, an album, very much down to earth, pleasantly slim produced, almost country-like Tumbleweed Connection or Honky Chateau; all natural so to speak, and the songs of a quality not heard since the second side of ""Sleeping with Past"". So why not five stars: Well, there is still a bit of the genius missing, the surprise element so to speak sorry Elton, a bit of nit-picking, really. You can still do better, but clearly, as you mentioned on the sleeve to Bernie: Things are just getting better..."
5,These Songs Have Brought Back The Old Elton John,This CD was my favorite for a while. Elton John is one of the most universil names in music. He is a master mind for great songs. 'Songs From The West Coast' really showed us that Elton can go back to his glory days. Bravo. That's all I have to say. Bravo!
2,EJ falls asleep at the wheel on trip to West Coast.,"You wil definitely need Love after listening to this depressing, anti climactic melancholy post marital bliss album. Let it go, leave it on the shelf, Do not buy it. Download the only good song on the album "" I need love"" or Tape the Video off MTV or VH1. Let it go. Wait for it to show up in the bargain bin at the store, it should only take a few months.Sorry Elton, I am a huge fan, 26th row ticket holder Elton/ Joel concert. This album wasnt even close to being satisfactory. What happened?"
3,"Nice effort, but nothing new...","I was expecting a new musical and lyrical growth from Elton to represent this new modern era. Instead, all you have is 1970's song writing mixed with 2001 music production. I've heard Elton sing it all before. This record sounds like he just did it for the money. All this coming from a huge Elton fan."
2,Wake me when it's over.,"I don't understand the hype for this album. It sounds like typical post-80's Elton: BORING! Although Elton is obviously long-past his 70's peak, his 80's releases nevertheless had one or two tracks that made them worth having (for diehard fans). But in the 90's, his music became almost exclusively ballads, often crossing over into schmaltz (Lion King, Princess Di, etc.). I stopped buying sometime around ""The One."" His current ""renaissance"" is based on soundtracks and AIDS activism--as he admits, he hasn't had a legitimately great album in over twenty years.To me, this one sounds like more of the same. Slow to mid-tempo songs, sung in his lower register."
4,perfect-o distort-o,"Trans Am is a great band, mixing electronic music with fairly straight-ahead rock. There's lots that should sound familiar to anyone who likes anthem-rock, but for some reason, it all sounds better when trans am does it. Same for the electronic stuff. It's simple and maybe even slightly cheesy, but it's got energy and intelligence behind it...somewhere. This is a great disc, but probably better suited for folks who already know the band. There's some really good live stuff on here, which is cool because many of their songs sound totally different in a live setting; I've seen them live twice, and they never disappoint. There are also some songs on here that can only be found on overpiced imports. This is a good deal."
2,Huh?,"I had read for quite some time that Trans Am was this really cool Alt-Rock/Electronica outfit which was taking things to the next level. This CD is a ""greatest hits"" or something, but it certainly doesn't impress this first time listener.There are some rather catchy tunes on here, but they are stuck between lo-fi jam sessions, and cacophonous bleep-fests. Possibly some good 'source material' for other artists looking for soundbytes or loops, but definitely a mediocre album."
1,Garbage,This is the first cd that I have purchased by Trans Am. I'm amazed that Thrill Jockey put this out. Is their other stuff this bad?
3,Good gun couple things wrong though...,"If you are looking for and acurate gun this is not the one to get, and since there is no hop-up you cant adjust the spin. It is really fast though, I was able to make my friend bleed through his northface. The laser also doesnt work and the scope aims about 4-6 inches too high and if you dont use it there are no sights on the gun. I recommend using the largest bb's that work for this gun so the accuracy is better.Pros-Fast/powerful-Cool looking-Large number of rounds-Good size-Easy to use and put togetherCons-Unaccurate-Friends wont fight with you-Scope doesnt work-Laser doesnt workOverall I'd say get it because it is great for the price, but dont be looking for the perfect gun."
1,poor quality,Bad design and materials used in production. This gun broke within hours of operation. I would spend your money on another gun.
1,DONT BUY THIS,ill keep it shortpros big capacity 300 roundsconsall plasticlow powerscopes fakelasers cheapvery flimsyfeels light itll shater if u drop it
1,Watch out! This TV may stop working right after your warranty expires,"This TV deserves zero stars if possible. I will never recommend this product nor buy any Philips product again. I bought this TV for almost $2k and it was working good until after 18 months when it suddenly went off, and instead of coming on, some red light started blinkng. Now I'll have to spend lots of money to fix it after Philips refused to take responsibility. It's interesting to note that I am not the only one facing this phenomenon of having his/her TV die right after the one year warranty expires. You don't have to take my word for it, just do a web search for Philips TV blinking problems and you will see what I'm talking about."
5,Excellent Plasma HDTV,Outstanding picture. My wife and I love the wide black frame around the screen really make it look like 65inch plasma TV.
1,beware of the cult following,"It was the review above that put me off this book, but I read extracts from my university library and also consulted ""joseph Beuys: the art of cooking"" from the same author and found nothing of use, just a general rantings of the authors relationship to the artist. well, good for you - but how does this help me? or anyone else?The author SEEMS to offer the same hero worship that Joseph Beuys was keen to escape from, given the dangers of idolising anyone, his critics certainly made a big deal of this (especially benjamin ""quite mean"" buchloh who compares Beuys to fascism and claims that a former luftwafe pilot cannot represent the art of post-war germany - but I say, look to your own problems in dealing with your national identity in the climate of psychological post-war reconstruction and leave the do-gooders be) and the image tends to override everything else - the lasting image is one of messiah and not creative freedom."
2,Not so bad,I don't like it much. I think it could be more interesting. It has too much fantasy. I think it could be a little more realistic.-- this is a review from a 9-year old girl.
2,"Original artists, but not original hits! Listen before you buy!!","I guess it's cheaper to get the original artists to do a remake of their hits, but what a shame. I'd save my money for the original hits--they're much better."
4,Schick Injector Blades,These are the only blades that my husband wants to use and they have become hard to find in retail stores. Very happy that I now can order them online.
2,Blech.,"I bought this cd in the hopes of enriching the Advent season, but was disappointed. It just comes off as a lot of grandstanding, with most of the songs having been written by Peter Hallock, the founder and musical director of the choir. He is a Doctor of Sacred Music, and it definitely sounds like it. If you also have a music degree, you may like it as well. But I thought it was unnecessarily complicated and hollow. I gave it two stars because of the Scripture readings; they didn't manage to mess those up."
5,Excellent Book,"When we decided to upgrade from Word 97 to Word 2003, I was worried about how I was going to learn all of the changes quickly. Since we didn't upgrade to Word XP (and I think there was another version before that even that we didn't go to)there was much to learn. For Word 97, the book Word 97 for Law Firms also by this author was my bible. This new book is even better and I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who uses Word in a law firm and needs to get up to speed quickly. It has a CD with practice files on it and there is a chapter on metadata (which my attorneys have been asking me about), and a great chapter on complex documents. The price of this book is a lot less expensive than a training class and it does a good job of covering all of the information that I need to know about."
3,Useful but basic,"A useful perspective if you are just starting out on upgrading to Office 2003 in a law firm from a previous version. Unfortunately this was published just a little late for us and we had done most of the legwork that this would have saved! It was still worth the purchase though for a couple of pointers that have allowed us to tweak settings that help to avoid problems.I found the information on Outline numbering much too simplistic to be helpful for troubleshooting numbering problems. There is no mention that using the bullets and numbering dialog box is known to cause document corruption, and of course this is a particular problem in complex legal documents.We do use it though as a handy reference for reminding us in IT what the concerns of our users are likely to be and a reminder of their level of understanding."
5,A standing ovation for this outstanding performance!,You don't have to be an opera love to love this book. Mr. Volpe is a great story-teller and what stories and backstage drama there is. This is a book that combines brilliant business insight with an amazing personal success story. It offers an insider's look at the stage of the world's best opera house and a backstage tour of divas and dramas. It's got something for everyone and Mr. Volpe's story is both candid and compelling. You feel like you have the best seat in the house after you finish reading this book. And I am waiting for an encore!
4,amps basics,"this is a small book dedicated to explain all the basic information about guitar amps, very educational.later when you read it well, you can move to more complex material like the tom mitchell book."
3,could have been better,"well what can i say ????? two comic book legends come together for a timely run (it was 94""!!) on the better of the then punishers books...... dixon the writer has done loads of the vigilante punisher storys before so he should have more of an edge on the character! with saying that the story of the punisher encountering the russian mob and his vigilante oppsite number a russian ex solider is all well and good, following the trail to war torn kosovo is a worthy one too its just that the story gets a bit bogged down in the plight of the war at the expanse of the action(lets face it, that is what pun man fans love!!!) kurbets art is well..... what can i say GREAT!! good to see the punisher drawen like a real person and not a muscle bond oaf!!! all in all not a bad tale but could have been better!!!"
4,Shadow Children are being executed? Or saved?,"Have you ever snuck into a prison to try to save your friend? Trey has! Join in on all the adventures that Trey, a third child himself, goes on to try to save third children and their families in a country that only accepts two children per family. All other children after the first two must be executed if they are found, or the family is fined a large amount of money that they must give to the population police. The population police are trying to track down third children so that they can execute them. The President of the country is telling them to execute all the innocent third children that they may find. Will Trey get caught by the President who is leading all of this mess? Or will he succeed in freeing the lives of his friends? If you want to find out what risks Trey takes, read Among The Brave by Margaret Peterson Haddix, the author of ""The Shadow Children"" series. This one is a page turner!"
4,"Good, but not great...","While this book was enjoyable to read, I wouldn't recommend buying it. If I didn't know better, I'd say Margaret Petterson Haddix is loosing her touch...Still worth reading, but I'd suggest borrowing it from the library rather than purchase. It was just confusing and hard to follow. A bit borring actually.Good overall, but unless you're a huge fan, I wouldn't buy it."
2,Not impressed,"While I liked the changed in perspective, this book just wasn't well thought out. I can forgive the fact that everyone seems to live within driving distance of each other but there were so many just plain strange jumps in the story. The story also wasn't consistent with its own rules. Everyone is supposed to carry the very important ID at all times - but it seems to be casually dropped as an important safety measure? This is not consistent at all. I had a hard time figuring out what was happening and why."
5,Still Enthralled,I was introduced to this series by a friend and I just cannot get enough of it. It just keeps getting better and better.
5,deservs a 5star for sure,i read this books 6 months ago and i still keep thinking of this series. my friend never liked to read she hated it she said she got bored after she started reading among the hidden she fell in love with these books i recomend thi book to anyone who enjoys a good and exiting tale. ;)
5,Great Children's series,I love this series for children. my daughter actually tells me how much she appreciates what she has now. She finished all 7 books in less than 2 weeks. It is a very captivating story.
5,Ernest Borgnine very good in this movie.,Great story line. Excellent human interest theme. Bit of a different role for Ernest Borgnine in his final years I believe.
5,grandpa for xmas,excellent sorry it did not get shown on Hallmark this year. next year I can watch it whenever I want
4,Heartwarming,"This is a great movie of a family reuniting during a time of need. It stars Ernest Borgnine who demonstrates he still can be a lovable old gruff. The movie is set during the Christmas Holiday but is enjoyable the entire year,"
3,OK Movie,"Amazon provided great service and fast shipping as always but if I had it to do over again, I would have chosen a different movie than this one. I have finally learned a lesson. Go to U-Tube and watch some of the movies there that you intend to purchase....before wasting your hard earned money on not so great movies."
5,Heartwarming,"A Grandpa for Christmas is a heartwarming tale of reconciliation. Ernest Borgnine is his usual somewhat crusty but loveable self, and Juliette Goglia, who plays his granddaughter, gets to show off her beautiful singing voice. If you like a story about family members coming together for the first time and helping each other, this movie is for you. I've seen it on TV twice. Now, I'm buying it!"
5,Borgnine Still Rocks,"At 90, Ernest Borgnine is still a better actor than others half his age. At 9, Juliett Goglia is a better singer and actress than others twice her age. And the supporting cast is excellent...Jamie Farr, Richard Libertini, and Katherine Helmond are a hoot together. Mix 'em all together in an interesting story about an angry child forced by circumstances into a new school with new friends, and a new home with a grandpa she's never known before, and you have a cute, funny and heartwarming story full of likeable characters...especially the leads played by Borgnine and Goglia (yes, that really is her singing). Highly recommended!"
5,dougrocks,I love a grandpa for Christmas. When ever it's on i watch it. Well i try. If i miss some off it or all i feel sad because i don't know when it will come on again. I feel its a good show. Thats some reasons why you should buy or watch it.
3,"very sloped, difficult for geriatric cat to use going down","My cat has recently started to have seizures and the medication used to control them has really affected his hind legs and balance. I thought these steps would help him to get up and down on the bed but the steps have a definite slope to them making my cat pitch forward quite a bit and it looks like he is very uncomfortable going down, as if he is afraid he will tip over. I have a book under the bottom step in an attempt to level the steps out and that has helped some. That being said, the steps went together quickly and are reasonably sturdy for a small animal. I wish the picture had been more clear how much of a slant there is to these steps as they are perhaps not the best product for my cat to easily maneuver."
1,Prt Gear Easy Step 111Pet Stairs,"Pet Gear Easy Step III Pet Stairs, 3-step/for cats and dogs up to 150-pounds, Large, CocoaThe pet steps were easy to assemble. However, I am not happy with it. My dog refuses to use it. He has arthritis in his back.It is my opinion, that the steps are too high and there is not enough surface on each step so that my dog can comfortably climb each step. No amount of pulling or pushing will help. He just refuses. So it is now a toy for my two-year-old grandson who likes to jump from the bottom step. When you design these steps , do you keep in mind that it might be used by an older dog or one who is slightly disabled? Charge more if you have to, but give us design that will be functional."
2,Pretty much worthless,"If you're thinking about these steps for anything other than a cat or ~20 pound dog, I recommend looking elsewhere. I have a 45 pound beagle and this product is so compact and poorly manufactured that he can hit the middle step and that's about it.Any weight on the top step causes the whole unit to wobble, even when it is wedged against the bed. Basically, if you think of this product as a cube which has six sides, it only has four (the back and bottom are empty space) which offers no support. If you put a large dog on these steps, not only would he/she physically be unable to use them because of the dimensions, the whole thing would utterly collapse."
3,too narrow.,too narrow for the 3 steps. my beagle would go up them but too narrow when going down. he felt unstable. returned it. i think the two step is more balanced.
4,Nice product,"I read many, many reviews before ordering this. We have an 11-year-old (luckily) very, very healthy 50-lb. dog who likes to curl up on a high-framed bed. She doesn't have too much trouble jumping on and off the bed without the stairs, but given her age, I wanted to make life easier for her and not wait for her to land wrong and hurt herself at her age. Like many of the other reviewers, we are have a bit of trouble getting her to use the steps, probably due to her aforementioned ease negotiating the height of the bed without them so far. She has no problem putting her front paws anywhere on them, but when it comes to committing her full weight to the steps with her back paws, she won't do it. I was glad to know this going in, and we will continue to work with her. We are very satisfied with the quality of the product, and I encourage purchasers to measure the height that they need as this product comes is varying sizes. I nearly ordered the wrong size, so be sure to measure."
2,Dog is afraid of these stairs,"First off, the product arrived in a timely manner and was fairly easy to put together. So thank you for that.However, for some reason my dog, after 2 months of having the stairs, is still afraid to go up and down the stairs! He is not afraid to go up and down any other staircase but this one. I'm not sure if it is because it is because the stairs aren't fully carpeted or because the last step (step closest to the floor) is angled in such a way that makes for a harder landing. I really can't figure it out! Sometimes he cries when he wants to come down off of the bed and then I just wait and wait until he gets down himself (was thinking he would eventually overcome his fear), but it isn't getting better!"
1,Dog steps,Dog is afraid and wont use it we used a bench made of wood he feels more secure cause it is solid he is a 130lbs rotti
2,Pet Gear Easy Step III,This product was impossible to snap together so I had to get a hammer and it dented the product. The stairs are slanted and my golden retriever would not go up them. Then the box stated for small dogs when the advertisement says for dogs up to 150 lb. I returned it.
2,Unsturdy Product,"We bought this item for our 50lbs english bulldog to get on and off the bed. The product is very unstable and our dog that is extremely used to stairs was scared to even get on it. I don't blame him, it looked like it was about to fall over as soon as he stepped on it.We will be returning this product and building our own stairs."
4,One of the betteer ones out there....,Structurally more sound than most snap together units. Looks pretty nice and female Lab was not freightened by it when she used it the first time. Easy to clean off and has good skid mats on steps.
5,Great item...but my dog won't use it,"The stairs are exactly as advertised. They were simple to assemble, the pieces just snapped together. But, my dog won't use them. I guess she's afraid of them. So, I'm going to unsnap them, put them back in the box and return them. Maybe if I had introduced her to these stairs when she was a puppy she'd use them."
2,Poor quality,Very disappointed in the quality of the product. Not sturdy enough to hold my dog of 135 pounds.He won't even get on it because it is unstable to walk on. I have tried numerous times to get him touse it and he refuses. I am sending it back.
5,Excellent!,"These are easy to assemble and easy to use. My dog loves them and figured it out pretty quickly. They do slant downward just slightly so she doesn't use them go to down from the bed, only up."
5,Great Pet Steps!,My 12 pound Terrier started having arthritis issues and was no longer able to jump up on the bed. I purchased 2 other types of steps before this one and was not happy with either. The Pet Gear steps are perfect. It was very simple to put together. Took maybe 5 minutes. The steps are deeper so there is more room for my dog to jump on them and he feels much more comfortable in doing so. The carpet makes it not slippery and the height is perfect for a bed.
2,For Smaller Dogs,"The description for these pet stairs said up to 150 lbs. The stairs are definitely designed for a small dog. I have a Golden Retriever that weighs 70 lbs. She recently had knee surgery so I bought the stairs to help her got onto our bed without risking injury to either of her back legs. The steps are so narrow and close together, that she couldn't figure out which paws to put on which stairs. She ended up skipping the middle stair, which totally defeated the purpose of the stairs to begin with. I sent these back and we had our handyman build wooden stairs that were set up better for a larger dog.I think they would be great to help a small dog reach higher pieces of furniture, but don't let the weight limit fool you. Large dogs will not handle these well."
4,steps,My dog thanks youShe now can get up to bed with out any helpTook only minutes to set upand about 20 minutes to train dog
3,ho hum ho hum,"might work for small dogs regarless of the rating, but unfortunately my rotty was not interested. I think they need to be more stable"
2,Shaky steps,I would not recommend these steps for a large dog. I have 2 golden retrievers; one is 76 pounds and the other is 92. The bigger one has trouble getting on our bed since we purchased a new frame. He has only gone up the stairs with assistance and they are shaky and do not seem to hold his weight very well. I will give it a few more days before I return them to petsmart where I bought them.
4,Solid and dog friendly,"Our Golden Retriever learned to navigate these steps after just two lessons. The steps are stable even with her 91 pounds. We took them out to the car when she had to get her annual exam at the vet's office and she went right up with no coaxing. Such a relief from hoisting her into the car. I wish the steps folded for easier transport (took up half the back seat) but probably they would lose their stability if they did. They were worth the money. If the dog fell or slipped trying to get up or down without steps, the vet bill would be horrific."
3,OK - SERVES IT PURPOSE,"This is the perfect size for my bed. The slanted stairs are a bit strange; one of my chihuahuas will use it and the other one will not; I now have 2 sets of steps in my bedroom. I was slightly difficult to put together, like other buyers, I had to use a hammer."
3,"I returned this item. However, I think it will work for some","Bought this for an older 70lb golden retriever as we have a high bed for him to get on and his back legs are getting pretty weak. It went together fine and didn't take but 10-15 minutes at most to figure it out. I do think it's a bit flimsy and specific to my case it was rather narrow and that was the main reason I returned it. Our dog just didn't seem to like that there wasn't much to walk on. I'm not sure I'd agree it would be good for dogs up to 150 pounds, but I do think it would work for dogs who are more surefooted or maybe smaller in size. I feel the description of the product was for the most part accurate and the product just didn't end up working for me."
4,"Good stairs, whole step should be covered in carpet","Bought these steps to allow our 14-year old Border Terrier easier access to the bed. While we were able to get him to use them, it would have been easier, and probably less unpleasant for him, if the entire platform of each step were covered in carpet. Instead, the carpet piece on there leaves the edges of smooth plastic open, meaning his paws would hit that and he didn't seem to enjoy it very much. Once he figured them out a bit more, everything was alright. But that simple adjustment would make these great."
3,BROKEN,a PART WAS BROKEN AND THERE IS A NOTE IN THE BOX (STATING BROKEN)FROM THE FIRST PERSON THAT BAUGHT IT AND RETURNED IT. WHY WOULD IT BE SENT OUT IN THAT CONDITION. MY HANDYMAN WORKED ON IT AND MY DOG IS USING IT. I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO RETURN IT AND GET IT REPLACED BECAUSE MY DOG IS OLD AND NEEDED IT RIGHT AWAY. AMAZON DID REFUND A PORTION OF MY PURCHASE PRICE
2,Slanted steps,"I got these for my aging, overweight, going blind precious pal. The steps are not level. They slant downward. She fell right down them and splatted on the hardwood floor. : ( Returned."
1,Disappointed,"The ""Pet Gear Easy Step III"" was very disappointing. The steps were too narrow and slippery for my 60lb dog. I returned it to the supplier 123 Stores."
3,Not For Pudgy Dogs,"My dog weighs 80 pounds and is considered a medium size dog, yes I know she is well nourished and has a figure problem. These stairs do require support on two sides. The stairs are butted up against my bed frame and then the night stand offers more support otherwise they do move and frighten my dog because they are unstable. It took a lot of coaxing and repeated lessons to get my dog to trust the stairs. She goes up fast now but is afraid...coming down is another issue, because the stairs slant she is fearful, so we end up picking up her large pudgy body and lowering her to the floor. The steps assemble quickly but they are not for bigger dogs. The description says it will hold up to 150 pounds but I would not recommend it. If I had to do it over...I would have purchased a ramp. These stairs are great for my two cats that weigh less than 10 pounds, they are suited to smaller dogs."
3,Slip n' Slide,"Very easy to assemble...all parts lined up. The stairs are at a very downward angle which is great for my dog to get up, but not down. He slides on the plastic at the edge of the steps and practically slips all the way down. He is only a 30-lb. dog. The carpeting is slippery also. If they would put non-slip tape on the steps, it would be better. I might have to put a 2x4 under the steps to make them more level. If I had to, I would not buy these stairs again especially for the price. A cat would have no problem going up/down them. I'm not sure whether to return them yet or not. My dog is trained in agility and still has trouble getting down them, so we'll see."
2,Big Disappointment,"The graphics are very poor and there is no way to use a controller, you must use the keyboard."
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the inferior graphics. I expected much more for my money, and once the disk is initialized, you cannot return it. So don't waste your money on this product."
4,You can't get bored,"This game is totally NOT Boring. Once you start to get tired of playing one way, you can change to another type of play and wait until you get tired of that type. I thought my favorite was the two sided until I started to play the ice Tetris, then I played the fire tetris. It just goes on and on including the classic. All tetris lovers must try this!"
3,Tetris rediscovered,I t wasn't the version I had anticipated but was enjoyable anyway. I'd looked a long time for a MAC version and this came close.
5,awesome,This was exactly what I was looking for. Got it within a reasonable time frame....very pleased
3,Hard to Follow any September,"My kids (and I) found this book hard to follow. It is much too complex for the age grop it is intended. Hard to follow, follow, follow ... Try to remember this next September!"
1,Really poor quality-broke the 1st time my daughter played with it,"Don't waste your money on this toy. My daughter played with this only ONCE (on Christmas) and several plastic parts broke off immediately. She is very gentle and loving with all of her Breyer toys, and was so disappointed at how fast it was broken. When I complained to the Breyer company, they sent out another of the same toy. We donated it."
2,Not very durable,My granddaughter gets frustrated with it as the doors fall off the truck. I thought Breyer would have a better product.
1,skip this brand,had i known this truck and trailer was gonna come apart each time my grandchild tries to play with it i would not have bought it. not only did amazon ship it to the wrong address and it arrived late but the top on the trailer come off every time he touches the thing and the goose neck connection comes off along with the rear view mirrors. this is the second breyer product that i purchased this year that will not stay together. my advise is skip this product line
1,CHEAP Junk,I never open the packaging. I could see the paint peeling off the trailer through the packaging. Poorly made. Cheap plastic tires and truck door looking as though it would fall off the truck. This all without getting the truck and trailer out. Not recommended.
2,"Very Small, cheap plastic parts, we're returning","My daughter was extremely disappointed in this product. The connectors (hinges) on the doors so cheap. One door hinge was visibly broke before she even unpackaged. She had used measurement specification given before buying but ends up not even the small polly pocket dolls fit inside nor her smallest horses. Once again, you're paying for a name and this time the product does not stand up to the name. We're sending it back. I give over all 2 because it's cute. If you want to put it on a shelf for something to pretty to look at then this is your toy."
2,don't waste your money,I bought this for my daughter. The first thing during the unpackaging was one of the side mirrors broke. The horses do not stay standing up and the back doors swing open so the horses fall out. She is so frustrated with it that she gave up. That was a waste of money.
3,Fun and cute but fragile,"This toy is very cute, I love to play with it! Unfortunately, it is my daughter's toy officially, and she is five years old, and the thing keeps coming apart. The top of the trailer comes off the hinges all the time, and the part in the back of the truck that the trailer inserts into comes off very easily, and is difficult for her to replace. It is just not sturdy enough for a little kid to play with, even one who tries to be careful."
3,Not as great as I originally thought...,"Breyer is a top line brand of horse toys, so I thought this trailer and truck would be a definate winner. I bought it for my son and ever since he first opened it, piece after piece have fallen off, snapped off, broken off, or was just made very flimsy. I think it's cute, and it's got a lot of cool features (doors that open, trailer detaches, etc.) but definately not for those that want to ""play with it""."
1,This product is not worth the money,"I purchased this truck & horse trailer for my son's Christmas present - the one thing he wanted. Everytime he tries to play with it the entire trailer falls apart. The top lid portion comes apart constantly, the 5th wheel attachment to the truck has come off a number of times. The horses will not stay upright, the back door does not stay closed. In my opinion, don't waste your money. It is a piece of junk for the price you have to pay. I thought Breyer made better toys than this."
1,very poor quality...don't waste your money!,WOW! What a surprise to open this item and find it poorly made and extremely flimsy. Not the Breyer quality I grew up with. Sad!
2,Pretty flimsy,"The hinges are very weak plastic and have already broken with light use,,,and the back doors on the trailer never closed we'll straight out of the box. We expected a lot more for the price, but it was made no better than many dollar store toys,,,, I'm really disappointed, your company used to make a lot better product"
1,Junk,Sadly the picture pretty much shows true size. I was very upset when I opened the box as was my daughter. She has all different size horses and none of them fit in this. If I had it to do over again I wouldnt pay $5 for this. Its something you would expect to buy at Dollar General or Family Dollar. Not from Breyer!!
1,Ordered as a gift,Much smaller than I imagined. I am just going to have to me more careful when I select the Breyer products.
1,Breyer Stablemates Pick - Up Truck and Gooseneck Trailer,"The Breyer Stablemates Pick - Up Truck and Goose neck Trailer is nice to look at But Is not suitable for kids to play with as it falls apart easily,the plastic is very lite weight and comes apart just too easily, this would suit someone wanting a display piece rather than a toy that can be used by kids."
2,Poorly Made but great idea for a toy,"Right out of the box a piece of the trailer broke. It is so flimsly. Unfortunately, I bought a Breyer toy similar a few years ago for my Godson and that broke as well, had to take it back. The kids were so excited and then to open the box and try to play with it when pieces are breaking off/already broke, is just sad to see. Not only does it have to be sent back, now we have to find a replacement. I do not believe I will be buying any more Breyer toys."
2,easily breakable,"My daughter had been begging for this trailer. She loves horses. She has the stable,and the hospital, and they stay together pretty well. The gooseneck trailer broke within a few hours after she started playing with it. The hitch that connects the truck to the trailer broke off. There is a silver colored piece that broke. I would not recommend thistoy unless you want to see a little girl's heart broken."
2,horsetrailer,"I bought this for my 3yr old nephew. He enjoyed the truck and trailer, but I thought the removeable doors on the trailer were very flimsy and difficult to put on after removal. The removeable parts seem as if they would break easily."
3,BREYER STABLEMATES PICKUP TRUCK AND TRAILER,BOUGHT FOR 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER SHE LOVES IT BUT THE TRUCK DOOR HAS FALLEN OFF ALREADY. WOULD THINK IT WAS MORE DURABLE BEING A BREYER. MAYBE I HAVE TO GO GERMAN MADE FOR REAL QUALITY.
2,Bought for daughter's birthday.,"I recently bought this for my daughter who loves horses. She was so excited about the trailer and the same day we gave it to her, a piece of the trailer broke. I was very dissappointed with it considering it was Breyer. When I was growing up, Breyer was a great product. I guess they've changed. My daughter was quite sad to say the least!"
2,Not worth the money,"I found this toy to be cheaply made, the inside fence broke on Christmas Day and the truck comes off it's trailer hitch often. The plastic is cheap, and it is overall smaller than pictured. After I bought it, I found many better ones for less money. Overall, my niece liked it a lot and plays with it often, so from that perspective I am happy with it. I suggest shopping around before you buy this one."
1,What else can break?,"Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away. I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this truck and trailer set, and the companion stable my daughter was given as a gift. The concept is great - the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets. She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended. It is also beyond repair as screws fall out of the door and can't be re-set due to the angle, mirrors snapped off, hinges broke. We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day. We have had a much better experience with the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister. Again, these Breyer play accessories are a waste of money being so poorly made."
2,Horses are not included!,"We bought this from toys r us offline store. When we opened it, one of the side mirror of the truck broken and the doors are not closed tightly.Moreover, there's no horse!! I paid about 35 dollars (not in here amazon).There's really really small comment that horses are not included in the back.I really really want to return it."
3,"Good, but . . .","While this seems to be a good product (admittedly, I don't possess it), I would think twice about buying it. ""The James Joyce Audio Collection"" (which I do possess) - another collection of readings at $20.97 (on Amazon as of 3/19/04; ISBN: 0060501790) - offers everything this product has and more for only an additional ten dollars. I suppose if you're only interested in the Joyce readings (only two on either collection, unfortunately), this may be the right product: they are undoubtedly the highlight of either collection, and are well worth even twenty dollars alone. Still, why throw away the opportunity to hear a fantastic reading of Molly's soliloqy, or listen to Fr. Arnall's hellfire sermon pounded out? Do yourself a favor and spring for the 4-disk ""Joyce Audio Collection."""
5,No one sings Bob Dylan was good as Joan Baez,"Joan Baez/ Any Day Now/ songs of Bob Dylan (Bonus Tracks): Everybody seems to know someone who just can't stand Bob Dylan's voice. If you want to treat that person to the art of Bob Dylan, get them this album. If you're a Bob Dylan fan, this album is going to be a treat for you as well. If you're a Joan Baez fan, well, you just have to have this one in your collection"
3,ole opry bias?,"However dated, all-american value has to last, in view of Baez' own too sparced album-release schedule nowadays. Neatly and lavishly packaged and augmented with at least 2 live tracks, the remastered double-LP-on-one-CD release may yield but 2 objections. First: compressed, kinda robbed of dynamics sound quality due either to the sourced analog tape or super bit mapping process employed to liven it up. Secondly, all her reissue activity considered, the 10th album hardly qualifies for reissue at all as doing no justice to Baez' brilliant folksy balladeer side (there was none to the Dylan-induced stampede-measured Nashville-produced material). Baez-wise, one should, first thing, get hold of the rest of them from Vanguard Records and other her labels. The program's obvious winner ""Love Is Just A Four Letter Word"" might stand on its own, but not within conext of Baez' discography. Regrettably, 2 live-in-Japan numbers are even more bland, thrown in for the sake of... I don't know what."
5,A Perfect Hit,"This CD changed my life! It's ecclectic blend of upbeat songs and a positive message has encouraged me to keep ""thinkin' that I'm thankful""A perfect score for a perfect CD!"
5,DINGO BALLS,"This is my dog's favorite treat. He doesn't care for the Dingo bones. Dingo balls are hard to find in Hawaii, well, at the stores that I go to, so, it's great that I can get them through Amazon.com. Delivery is very fast!"
2,dingos,The red part of the dingos was missing from 3 of the balls in one bag and two of them in the other. The others have not been opened yet and I found this very upsetting since this is the part the the puppies go for first. I don't mind paying that price if it is as shown. The bag show no white only balls.Theresa Miller
5,Chihuahua heaven is right!!,"upon reading the reviews and the fact that my dog loves the regular dingo bones and the dingo twists, if figured id try these too. theyre great. my dog loves the red strip of ""chicken"". lol idk about chicken being red but what ever, he loves it. keeps him busy and out of trouble. before he destroys the little ball i try and play with him rolling it around but he just gets it in his mouth and paws and goes to town. highly recommend this product. PS, Idk why, but theres a dingo dental mini bones...its the same as the other regular mini bones. those are also cool. I find those last the longest, so get those if you want these bad boys to last."
4,Dingo Goof Balls Value bag,My little dachshunds really like these. They get the meaty part eaten right away so they don't always work on the rawhide part. Good value tho and appropriate for smaller dogs.
3,Your dog will go through them fast.,"I like that I can stuff treats in the center of them, but my dog's an enthusiastic chewer and she's through with this in no time. I order them occasionally for a little variety."
2,Not too good,They were kind of cheesy...I thought we could play with them a little before my dogs got to munch on them but they fell apart in the bag - Not good
3,Trance Visionary Remake,"Since the biggest complaint about Trance Visionary was the lack of those famous Wishbone Ash guitar lines, Mike Bennett and Andy Powell went back into the studio and remade the album. They added those missing guitar pieces and gave it a live feel, thereby coming up with a new version of the album called Psychic Terrorism.Still, I am a great fan of good old rock and roll, and don't much like the album. I would, however, recommend this album for people who are lovers of techno music and would want to hear what a fusion of techno and rock might sound like. I would consider this album as more of a ""club"" mix, but there is a lot guitars."
1,dont buy this,"im a huge wishbone ash fan have been for 30 yrswhen i bought it i had to check to see if someone slipped a techno cd in on me. but unfortunately it was, much to my amazement- wishbone. file this under G for garbagethis really should come with a warning label"
3,please read,"way over priced 4 a 30 min episode,$26 to watch a whole season u cant keep or go to wal mart and buy the dvd 4 $24"
4,Review,Cd's were in great shape and arrived in a timely manner. The seventh season was much better than season six which I felt was sort of slow. The storyline for season seven was more believable than season six.
3,Weeds Season 7,"What can I say, it's Weeds!! Love the series, but these episodes are very short. The price was right, if it had cost more I would have been disappointed."
5,AHHHH Can't wait to see more!,"I know everyone raves when they talk about a show that they enjoy, and really why would you spend money for a show you weren't into? So it probably comes as no surprise when I say that I love the story line and can't wait to see what happens next season. I won't give away any spoilers so I'll stop now. But if you are into a little bit of drama and strongly believe that families should stick together you will enjoy this show."
5,I LOVE NANCY BOTWIN,"Weeds is the best show ever! Its soooo funny, cleaver, and its touching all at the same time. I watched all the episodes in one day. Now I anxiously waiting for season 8."
3,Weeds 7,Not as absorbing as previous series. Maybe the story has exhausted its potential. Loved the earlier work but this one not so much.
5,Weeds,This has been a great DVD series. Really funny. I can't waitfor season 8. I would highly recommend to anyone.
3,WEEDS GOING DOWN HILL?,"I LOVE THIS SHOW IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES, BUT SOMETHING ABOUT SEASON SEVEN DIDNT DO IT FOR ME LIKE THE PREVIOUS SEASONS. MAYBE I'M JUST A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED IN HOW THE SEASON IS ENDING. I FELT LIKE THE FIRST FEW WERE EXTREMELY EXCITING AND FUNNY TO WATCH. I ALSO MISS CELIA!"
3,Season 7...eh...,"Seasons 1-5 of Weeds were great! They grabbed you and left you hanging to see what was going to happen next. The final three seasons weren't bad, but they weren't all that great either. Lacked the punch of humor and drama that the previous ones had. Elizabeth Perkins absence from the show is definitely felt..."
4,A little crazy,"I have watched the entire series of Weeds and it has gone downhill a little since the beginning episodes. The series should have ended a few seasons ago. sp season seven is pushing it. Cast is still great, plot is still crazy, but sagging somewhat."
5,Weeds Is STILL Smokin,"I am an avid Weeds fan, I've followed the show since season 1, and season 7 proves yet again why Weeds is such a smash hit. The characters find themselves in a new setting with a new list of wildly fun guest stars. Each of the main cast goes under some form of change whether it be mentally or physically. The writing is just as snappy and the characters, well developed. Season 7 bought back Heylia James and all the comic relief that comes with her. I am most anxious for season 8, and do hope they bring back Celia Hodes."
2,Weeds Season 7,"I was eagerly awaiting this season to see if this show could possibly go back to the old glory days of seasons 1 through 3, but I was highly disappointed. I found this to be the most un-entertaining seasons of all them (including season 4). It was very poor jokes in my opinion and poorly written. I think the only reason I will watch season 8 is because of the cliffhanger it left at the end of the last episode."
2,What happened?,"Get ready for a complete 180. There is very little drama and action in season 7. Weeds had some bad ass villains in years past...Armenian drug lords, crooked DEA agents, Mexican hit-men, and the great U-Turn just to name a few. How do the creators justify following those brutish adversaries with the cream puffs of season 7 which include preppy college weed dealers and effeminate male models? Perhaps the writers were smoking weed of their own while typing up the scripts. Season 7 is a throw-away. The last time I saw a show jump the shark this bad was when Stephen Urkel started inventing jet packs and personality-changing machines on Family Matters. In addition to a lack of drama, season 7 wasn't laugh worthy either. The characters of Andy and Doug were not written nearly as funny as they were in prior seasons. Here's to hoping that things will turn around in season 8."
2,Eh.,"Weeds season 7 was mediocre. The season ended and I felt that nothing had gone anywhere and it was just the ending to another episode. If you're a Weeds fan, you might as well watch it, but I wouldn't say these past few seasons are getting any better.Also, the DVD was hard to navigate and I couldn't skip intro previews very easily, but maybe it was just my BluRay player."
2,Not as good as the originals,"They need to end this show soon. Its running on fumes! And just like how Charlie Sheen was getting a little old for his role in 2 and a half men and one of my favorite actors/comedians Dennis Leary was starting to get a little bit old for his character Gavin in Resuce Me. I think Mary Louise Parker is getting a little old for Nancy, though she's still cute in her own way, and she was really hot when the show first began. Also her sons are gonna have to grow up and move out (and hopefully not sell drugs) at some point."
2,Why cant I stop watching this awful show?!,"I had to buy this because I watched all the season available on netflix and they ended with a cliffhanger but trust me, just as bad as all of the other seasons! Same things happen in every season. It's not creative or original."
1,We just don't enjoy Weeds anymore.,"We really enjoyed the first two or three seasons of Weeds. Now, we can do without it. Plot has gotten too extreme and characters are no longer compelling to watch."
3,"Great show, but problems viewing","I loved the show. The only issues I had were with the streaming HD video. I kept getting a ""Bandwidth is too low"" notice and the picture quality would go down. Over and over and over. Annoying. I purchased the HD version of the show, have high speed internet, a brand new modem to accomadate the internet speed, but still had issues viewing Weeds in HD. I lost some money on this. One of the episodes was only available on line because of a compatibility issue with my Panasonic Blu-Ray player. Just the one episode. Weird. Annoying."
3,Was alright.,This season was ok. The ending was very disappointing. It seemed like they just wanted to end it with some huge twist but the twist wasn't necessary. It was almost like they didn't have any ideas for an ending so they made a stupid one. But the show is still ok. And the woman who plays Nancy is still a bad actor (in my opinion) but the rest of the cast is pretty good
1,wtf,"i actually can't believe this show last for seven seasons. it started out interesting with multi-dimensional characters, but ended up a bad ripoff of itself. the plots became repetitive and boring, and nancy went from being worried mother to psychopathic whore."
1,what a disappointment,"I loved the first few seasons of Weeds, what happened? It went from funny , entertaining, to dark and miserable for the most part. Everybody got ugly and angry , who wants to watch that , not me! Nancy became obnoxious, treating her family like sh*t. whatever inspired the creators to go that route I have no idea. Life is hard enough , I watch things to be uplifted, not dragged down into angry bullshit , isn't there enough of that in the world without having to make TV shows about it too?So disappointing, the makers should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Love this show,"Was it the best season yet? No. But it's still very good. Still one of my favorite shows. Definitely worth the watch. Silas is hotter, Shane is crazier and I hate Nancy more than ever. Can't wait for Season 8 to come out."
5,LOVE IT,The show is well written and acted. The characters are funny and lovable. Can't wait until I can buy season 8.
4,Weeds Season 7,"It was great to be able to stream this season since netflix is so behind the times, but the problem I have with the amazon streaming is that there is no provision for subtitles. Since I am hard of hearing, I use the english subtitles that netflix provides. So, what's up amazon. Why don't you provide them?"
2,Love weeds But...,You can only watch this show so many times before the Tory wore itself out.... I kind of lost Interest after season 5 I won't be watching season 8
3,Closing time,"I have enjoyed this show a lot, but feel it's closing time now. Instead of extending it for one last season, this season probably should have been the last. I found Nancy to be extremely irritating and had never felt that way before, so for me, that's a sign it's time to go. The season seemed to drag after the first and until the last couple of shows, but those seemed hurriedly thrown together to bring the show back on track. Overall, if you're a Weeds fan, you have to watch it, but you'll most likely be wishing for shows like the older ones."
2,"If you haven't started the series, don't start now","Actually, if you want to start, I don't think that I would watch past season 3. I loved this series and can't help but watch it every season with the *hope* that something gets better. But since about season 3 or 4 the story line has been absolutely ridiculous. This one was by far the worst. I used to root for Nancy, now she (and her kids) get on my nerves. Characters are no longer likable. I'm pretty much done with this series after this letdown of a season.I guess this is sort of how I pretend the last season of Lost didn't exist ;)"
2,"Jumped the shark, nuked the fridge, just not funny anymore","With season seven, Weeds has finally blown past its freshness date. This was once the funniest show on television, but it has become a boring slog of plot reversal after plot reversal, each more stupidly contrived and ironic then the last. There just aren't any good laughs anymore, if it wasn't for the Kevin Nealon character there wouldn't be a good line for any of the thirteen episodes (but his screamingly funny ass-rip of two SEC agents in episode 8 is one of the highlights of the whole series). The Nancy Botwin character has long lost any sympathetic quality she had and has turned into a grotesque loser, to the point that I truly don't care anymore what happens to her, or to any of them. In fact (without going into a spoiler), when the last few seconds of the final episode had played, all I could think of was: Good! What a great place to end it! Shame, what happened to this show."
3,"Not so grand ""finale""","As the previous season wound down (6), Weeds lost more of its interest waned. But Season 7 was a letdown; too much violence, sick of the cursing, and the main characters became more of ""hardened criminals."" Most he humor went down the drain and the end was huge letdown to me. I would not recommend this series!"
4,"""Weeds"" Takes a Bite Out of the Big Apple","Season Seven of ""Weeds"" brings the dysfunctional Botwin family to New York, where the laughs and marijuana flow freely. Series creator Jenji Kohan regains the serio-comic momentum lost in the previous two seasons. Though the cliffhanger falls flat, the 2011 episodes maintain a high batting average. Mary-Louise Parker and Company shine as always, with a good showcase for Kevin Nealon's revitalized Doug Wilson. However, one senses the iconoclastic show is finally winding down . . . and not a moment too soon."
5,~*The Best Dance Music in the World!*~,"this is the best cd. i bought it after i saw the movie, and ended up making a pom's routine to ""We're Dancing"". the cd had a wide variety of music, so i am never bored!"
4,Really Cool!,"I saw this movie and really enjoyed the music in it. I bought this a while ago and still play it very frequently! I liked the tracks ""First Kiss"", ""I Wanna Be With You"", and ""oh...ok I like every track! :)"
5,One Of The Best,"This is truly one of the best CD's I have ever bought. The songs range from pop to r& b and can fit any mood you are in. Not only that, you can dance to all of them, which is perfect. I have to say that I like every single song on this album, but my personal favorites are:1) I Wanna Be With You-Mandy Moore3) Don't Get Lost In The Crowd-Ashley Ballard4) We're Dancing-PYT5) Friends Forever-Thunderbugs8) Cosmic Girl-JamiroquaiThis is a must have CD for anyone who loved the movie ""Center Stage"", or for anyone who is looking for a CD with great songs to dance to."
4,Center Stage Soundtrack,"When I first saw the movie, I was skeptical about the music. I was expecting the soundtrack to have all of the classical stuff that had been used for the more mainstream performances. Instead, they included songs like First Kiss and I Wanna Be With You (which I have to say is not my favorite song). All in all, a well-rounded soundtrack. I'm really glad they left Come Baby Come on the soundtrack. 4 stars.Disappointments: They left ""Candy"" off the soundtrack, and put on ""I Wanna Be With You."" Small mistake there."
5,Great Movie! Great Soundtrack!,I saw this movie twice last weekend and loved it! The movie and the music made me want to go home and dance for the first time in 4 years! It inspired me to do something else with my life! The movie really focused on dancing (broadway and ballet) and what the dancers have to go through. As soon as the DVD comes out I am getting it and I ordered the CD yesterday and can't wait to get it as well! If you loved Fame or Stayin Alive you will love this also.
5,This is one of the best CDs I own!,"I bought this CD the day it came out and I love it! The songs all seem to tie in well to the movie, which I haven't gotten to see, but looks amazing! My favorite tracks are:#4- ""We're Dancin'"" by P.Y.T. I love this song, it's got a great rhythm and the group is my favorite!#7- ""A Girl Can Dream"" by P.Y.T. I think everyone can relate to this song... well, girls at least. The group is so sweet, they're the nicest girls. Anyone who enjoyed their songs needs to be on the lookout for their new single ""P.Y.T. (Down With Me)"".#2- ""First Kiss"" by International 5 (I5) This song is very different, much like their new release ""Distracted"", which is also a great song!#1- ""I Wanna Be With You"" by Mandy Moore This song was a hit. Enough said.Overall, I thought this CD was great!"
3,its ok - i've heard better,"The best thing about this cd is the salsa of Jamirouqe(?) and the Red Hot Chili Pepper's cover of Stevie Wonder's 'Higher Ground'. Other than that it's your standard teenage bubblegum. Michael Jackson is overused (can't they find something else to rock to). If you want a good Michael Jackson album buy Bad, that's where the songs come from. This is a Fame-wannabe. The least the director could have done is have some original songs written for the movie. The movie was ok - the dancing was stupendous. But it could have been better. If you want a good dance album - pick up Saturday Night Fever or Fame or Bad or Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life."
4,"Ok, except for the PYT","I loved this movie and the soundtrack is great, too, except for those two crappy songs by the talentless teen-terror girl group, PYT. They are the most awful group I've ever heard. ""We're Dancing"" is just another stupid synthesized pop song, and ""A Girl Can Dream"" is pointless, silly, and just plain bad. The other songs on the CD are good, though."
4,Great Soundtrack,"The Soundtrack was as good as the movie with a few exceptions.I could do without the Latino song ""Come Baby Come"" which not many people like to listen to unless dancing in a Salsa bar. Also one of the better songs I beleive it's called ""Candy"" is missing from the soundtrack. This would be the song during the warm-up at the dance studio. Why must they cut songs that should be on the soundtracks out of them?"
4,Awesome CD,"After seeing the movie, and falling in love with it I decided to go out and buy the CD. It was probably one of my best buys ever. I even got my friend stuck on it. Every song is worth listening to and even reminds you of the scene it goes with in the movie. I would suggest that you go out and buy it today!"
5,This CD totally deserves Five Stars!,This awesome soundtrack I play over and over again. I especially love We're Dancin by P.Y.T. and the soul version of I Wanna Be With You. This is the best soundtrack I've ever had and I totally reccomend it!
5,A review of Center Stage from a DANCERS POINT OF VIEW,"~~In my opinion, this is an excellent sound track with a catchy beat and a smooth dance-like tempo. The songs that impressed me the most were definetely ""We're Dancing"" by P.Y.T., ""Friends Forever"" by Thunderbugs (which was also a great graduation song for all of those who are graduating this year or leaving their friends), ""Higher Ground"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, and ""Canned Heat"" by Jamiraquai. These songs we used in my dance class for warm-up and practice. Overall I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes to dance or likes to listen to up-tempo music, that will really get them off their feet and make them WANT TO DANCE!"
5,This CD is AWESOME,"I bought this CD the day it came out and it was really really good. If you are a pop music lover then you will like it a lot. The Mandy Moore song ""I Wanna Be With You"" shows a much more mature sounding side of Mandy. The awesome group of 13 and 14 year olds, PYT put out 2 awesome songs on this album, uptempo ""We're Dancing"" and slow tempo ""A Girl Can Dream"" (my favorite because it's really pretty and I can relate to it a lot). Some other tracks I really liked are ""First Kiss"" by International Five and ""Friends Forever"" by Jamorique (I think I spelled it right). If you love pop music about love and relationships, you'll love this CD so I reccomend buying it if that kind of music is your cup of tea :)."
5,It is one of the best soundtracks,"This CD is one of the best soundtracks I have heard. I don't have to skip any of the songs because I like them all. ""We're Dancing"" is one of my favorite tacks on the CD and I also like the Mandy Moore track ""I Want to be With You"". It seems that with such a goo round up of songs the movie will be great. I can't imagine it not being as good as the soundtrack."
5,Exellent !,"If you liked the movie (hey, even if you didn't enjoy the movie), you should definatly get this soundtrack! So many different styles of music and artists are included in the tracks."
1,center stage,I never received my CD. I sent an email to customer service telling them I never received it and they gave me a credit on my account.
3,Pam Roberts plans may not come to be !,"The Circle C burns down, Pam Roberst is placed as the CON and eventually she gets a position on the Board of the Hospital at Chandler Springs. Sophie gets Married and Margret and Sean become engaged, a lot of action in this book. This is the third in a series of books.Great writing by the author and I am looking forward to reading the Nurses, so I can see what happens .... I am now excited about Chandler Springs and all the Gang."
5,Small Press Legend Does It Again,"A.D. Winans has been writing poetry that matters for years. In this new collection, we find a bit of his old stuff as well as a bit of his new stuff. Either way, the effect is the same--brilliant poetry. This isn't everyday run-of-the-mill tomfoolery--this is poetry that lashes out at injustice. Winans has a way of bordering between the political and personal, and it works. I highly recommend this book to long time Winans fans as well, as newcomers to his work. It's a joy to read. Plus, the 20 odd photos in the book give it a personal, historical feel. This is one of the major poetry books of the year."
5,District X: X marks the spot!,"An amazing combination of brilliant, convincing dialogue by Hine and explosive graphics by Yardin & Co. There is Brooklyn and the Bronx. Then there's District X, a section of Manhatten filled with regular mutants, working the hussle of everday life. Follow the story of Ortega, a family man, a rookie cop, exiled from Cuba because his parents were the only thing worse than mutants: poets! His new partner is guess who? No other than the ex X-Man Bishop. These 6 first issues, bound handsomely by Marvel Knights, will delight and entrance all who glipse its glossy pages. Git down on it!"
3,"""Notes"" being the operative word.","According to the back cover blurb, this book is the best written on the Languedoc region of France. Not so. Though billed as a travel book, Notes is more aptly described as a collection of letters about Mr. Wright's personal experiences while living in the area. Lengthy anecodotes about sailing, biking, eating abound, while info about the Languedoc itself are sparse. OK as a memoir, not as a depiction of the region."
1,Cry Me A River!,"Oh, my God! What a depressing book. I counldn't finish the damn thing! Cry yourself a river and be done with it girlfriend! Where do some of these silly writer's come from anyway? I suppose in all fairness to this writer/want-to-be, this book did have one thing going for it (as a second thought), I did like the cover. There are so many seasoned writers out there that are better equipt to offer sound advice with this (self-helf) issue. I'd go with them and see what they have to say before purchasing the very expensive paperback. ($17 bucks, ouch!) Sort of pricey to be bored to death, don't you think?"
1,not at all what i expected!,I thought by rading all the reviews on this page that it would be a good book...NOT! It wasn't beleivable or very realistic. The whole thing seemed far fetched and questionable. I had to force myself to read it. It was not a good book at all. I saw so many errors in the grammar and spelling throughout the entire book. I can't understand why a publisher would put their name on this book!!
1,One word...Whiny!,"Please don't whine about your past. How can you ever expect to move forward if you are so caught up in the past?? This book reads terribly, it is far fetched.The author is shamelessly adding her book to top sellers as a 'also recommended' SAD...SAD...SAD!I didn't like it, I read the other reviews and thought I would actually get a wonderful book. But what a shoch I got when I opened the envelope it came in and began reading this expensive piece of CRAP!!Don't waste your money!! I wish someone had warned me!"
1,Jerry Springer without the humor,"I am astounded at the number of positive reviews of this book on this site. I would have guessed that the reviews had been written by the author herself; however, Ms. Stewart writes at fifth-grade level and many of the reviews are better written.I am a psychotherapist who has worked with abuse victims for twenty years. Ms. Stewart emphasizes at the end of her book that abuse victims need therapy. I would be surprised if the author has had therapy, as her writing shows no connection with any underlying feelings and absolutely no insight into the impact of the abuse on her life. Struggling through the horrible grammar, spelling, punctuation and the annoying immature writing style, I was left with a perception of a pathetic woman who has embraced victimization as her only identity.This was an expensive little book; only the second in a lifetime of reading that I will be throwing in the trash rather than keeping in my library or sharing with others."
2,too many errors!,"I appreciate everything that she experienced, but when people purchase a book, they don't expect to find numerous mistakes such as typos and incorrect usage of a word. The book could have been better had the publisher/editor done their job. These errors reflect on the author. I wonder if her rough draft was published without polishing it up. I did enjoy the book though."
5,Delivery Of A Poignant Look At Abuse,"having read THE GLASS CASTLE as well as SMASHED, I can tell you that NIGHTMARES ECHO fits right in among the books mentioned. In NIGHTMARES ECHO, the author relates to the reader the horrowing child and sexual abuse she endured. Pushing the pain down below the surface and then years later watching it unfold before her eyes with no way to stop it. Through courage, she and her husband were able to fight through the demons that threatened to take her life completely away,and learn how to control and even go on to become a survivor. I have reviewed all three books mentioned above, and do believe if you want the full scope of what life is like for those you shun, perhaps it is time you read real life memoirs."
5,What a Story,"Unbelievable what this child-teen-adult went through. The manipulations,the emotional and physical abuse,the sexual abuse. I cried hard tears for this child with a Monkey on her back. Amazing book. sad realization of what children go through and no one ever sees or is it that they don't want to see?Blair Seaborne"
1,Grammar Echos,"I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This seems as if it was written by a middle-school student. The mistakes take away from the writing and believe me, the writing cannot afford it! After reading the book, I feel as if I know nothing about the author. The book was missing so MANY important details. For example, once the mother walked in and caught her husband abusing her daughter, WHY WAS NOTHING DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It seems as if the father got away scot-free with sexually abusing his daughter, her friend, and murdering his wife. It kind of reminded me of the Dave Pelzer books - highly unbelievable and unlikely. I don't even feel sorry for the author because it is so poorly written and unbelievable!"
1,"Don't buy this book, it isn't worth the paper or ink","(...)Can we talk just about the writing, the punctuaiton, the wrong use of words the confusion of verb-tense?Can we also talk about a woman, who claims to be 40, who thinks that at 21 she had finally learned to become a woman? You might think that at 21, but by 40 one would like to believe that wisdom and self-reflection would give you perspective on how young we really are at 21. (...)"
1,"You can have my copy, it's at the city dump.","I stumbled unto this book looking for another I ignored the negative reviews and now I'm reporting on my disappointment from my decision to purchase this book. After the first few pages because of so many errors you don't even want to continue reading it. Dare I say I would have enjoyed getting my teeth pulled more than trying to finish this book. It is a book of such poor quality that I wouldn't even use it to line the bottom of my bird cage( I love my birds ). Anyone considering wether to buy this book or not, I say not. You can have my copy, it's at the city dump."
5,great story,"This is the only Care Bear book I had growing up and I now read that same copy to my son. It's beautiful illustrations are gentle and the story is simple and sweet...just what kids NEED today! I am ordering a ton of the other books because I love the modern fairy tale that the Care Bears are, when handled the way THESE books depict them. No ""villains"", all real inner conflict that children experience with real solutions.These are great books!"
4,"great Christmas music, but depressing at times","Most of the songs are good renditions of popular Jul songs, but I find the organ instrumentals depressing and too church-like. If those songs were happier and joyous sounding, I would have rated this a 5."
5,The Dukes!!,Got this during the Gold Box Deal of the day! What a deal it was. We have loved the Dukes of Hazzard since we were kids. Loved Watching them on tv! Now my kids get to enjoy them with us. Will not be disappointed it is an amazing set.
5,Hazzard box Set,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. It has the whole series, and a bonus DVD or clips of the reunion to current times, and looking back. My hubby really enjoyed that part of it. I believe it also details facts of the car and how things were done. This a great buy for any Hazzard County fan."
3,Trailer What?!,"Low budget shows heavily now, but my wife, who I bought this for, just loves those good ole boys. Came individual season box sets, instead of one big complete season volume, that I thought it would be. Outside of that, no complaints."
4,Horrible front label!,"A wonderful kitchen trash can, but OXO's label in the front of the can was a struggle to get off! When I finally did remove it, the black finish on the front of the can was a bit ruined. Can't OXO use an easily removable label from plastic?"
4,black trash can,"Great trash can as I was looking for an all black can and could not find one in any store. Slight trouble with removing label. The only reason it did not get 5 stars, I felt the garbage can was over priced but I desperately needed an all black can."
4,Missing foot pedal.......,"I am apparently not the only person missing the foot pedal....Love the can, but want the part. This can matches another size (8 gallon) and the other came with the foot pedal. I will investigate and hope to receive. Love the cans!"
3,Disposable Garbage Can?,"I really liked this garbage can. It is a good size and the bags do stay secured. However, the screws holding the pedal in place kept falling out and now the pedal has broken off. I wasn't expecting to have to replace this garbage can after only 6 months!"
4,Amazon dropped the ball,"I ordered this Trashcan from Amazon for almost $40. When it arrived, poorly packaged, the foot pedal was missing. I contacted Amazon for a replacement, or significant discount on the defective unit. They were unable to do either, they claimed not to carry OXO anymore. The only offer they had for me was to return the unit at a great inconvenience to me. I contacted the manufacturer, and they have made good on the replacement part. I also noticed the product was 25% cheaper from the manufacturers website, and they offer free shipping. Amazon is no longer king of the best price around."
2,nice trash can but...,"This is a nice trash can. Looks nice, works well, but the hinge on the lid sticks out about 3 inches in the back. Consequently the trash can will not set against the wall without scratching the paint and looks like its sitting in the middle of the floor."
5,great trash can,"This is the best trash can we've owned. I bought one and loved it so I bought a second to use for recycling; then bought a third for outside by our pool. It looks great, functions well, and is larger and sturdier than any other trash can we found - all at an excellent price. Highly recommended."
4,OXO Good Grips A+,"Product lives up to the hype. !3 gallon bags fit well and are easy to remove and replace. I was a bit hesitent to buy after reading about the difficulty some had removing the front label however, I had no problem removing the label we just peeled it back slowly. Contains odors well and the color is great in my kitchen. I had previously purchased 3 other trash cans for the kitchen looking for one I could live with. This is it!"
5,Works great! Looks good!,Just got this can looks and works great. The label did come off just peal it slow. The lock to hold the bag in also holds bag!
2,Worked great...for 3 months,"I bought this trash can in September, and it worked great for the first 3 months. After that, I noticed that the pedal felt a little weird. When I took a closer look, I saw that one of the plastic components of the pedal mechanism had broken off. I called Oxo and they said I could ship it back at my expense. Ugh! It was past Amazon's 30 day policy, so they wouldn't give me a refund either. It's frustrating that Oxo won't stand by their product and pay for shipping for a defective item."
5,Highly recommend,"This Oxo Good Grips trash can is attractive (by trash can standards), sturdy, and functional (the bag holder keeps a standard 13-gallon kitchen trash bag in place well, and the foot pedal keeps me from having to come into contact with the trash). As other reviewers have stated, removing the sticky label on the front of the can slooooowly is key.I considered purchasing a Simple Human trash can for my kitchen, but just couldn't bring myself to spend that much on a trash can. I've had good luck with Oxo products, and this one is no exception."
5,Very nice addition to my kitchen!,"I was thrilled to get this and it fits great in my kitchen. I love the foot pedal opening lid and the bag holder (to make sure that the bag doesn't fall down inside the can).I actually received 2 foot pedals in my package. I guess I got someone else's that posted a review before that they didn't get one in their box.The kids can use it easily and it's a great color (black), which is hard to find in regular stores."
4,Darned Label Earns it 4 stars.,"The trashcan is fine. I was all ready to report that OXO heard you and changed the way the label sticks to the front of the can. It was much easier to remove than I had read. However, there was a thin line of residue and I tried to remove it with Goop off and ruined the finish. So, this little trash can is costing me $80.00 because I had to order a second one. Also, be careful not to discard the pedal cover. Whatever you do don't use Goop off to remove the label."
4,Black 13-gallon trash can,"Finding a black trash can can be a difficult task without the internet! I was glad to have found this one that is big enough for trash accumilated by a family of 6. The foot pedal is great(works perfectly by the way) and keeps the lid closed so my 2 dogs can't get into it and spread trash all over my kitchen.Good value all around. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's made of plastic that can possibly break.Don't worry about the description saying the mouth is wide, your regualar tall kitchen bags will fit with no problem."
3,All right! I give up!,"How do I get the icky adhesive off that was used to attach the label? I ordered this nice-looking black sleek trash can, and now the front has a yucky sticky spot on it, after trying several solvents to get the gunk off.The foot pedal sticks up too high for an easy step, and I'd like the top to open up wider with the pedal. Otherwise it's OK for a reasonably priced trash can. The hook to lock in the plastic liners is a nice feature."
3,Not the best I've seen...,"To put it simply: I've seen better...much better on the subject. I honestly did not find the book very comforting to read. There were also a lot and I say a lot of refrences to ""God"" and religous texts. In numerology books there is usually a little and that's fine but this book seemed more religious if anything.It was an interesting read however, and did have a lot of depth. I'd rather read other books on numerology though."
4,Memories with a Twist of Time.,Refreshing familiar music with the edge of todays sound. Enjoyable to hear a woman's voice bellowing the tunes we remember from yester-year.
4,Stoned Immaculate,"I'd say 7 of 17 cuts on this CD are very good to excellent. That's as many as can be expected on ANY CD! The best cut is ""Wild Child"" by the Cult. What a powerful band! The last 30 seconds or so of this song alone make it worth buying. And Ray Manzarek on keyboards is the icing on the cake. Even better than the Doors original version from ""the Soft Parade"" album. My second favorite track is ""Children of Night"". It's tightly edited organ music from ""When the Music's Over"" with new spoken poetry consisting of lines from ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" with a great beat! Excellent and unique! There'a a version of ""Light My Fire"", sans organ solo, by Train. I thought it was dreadful the first time I heard it. ""Light My Fire"" without the trademark organ solo is a song with its heart and soul cut out. However, after repeated plays it sort of grows on you. It does have a short & sweet guitar solo which sounds alot like Krieger himself."
4,I must have this...,"I have not purchased this cd yet...but I saw it on VH-1 Storytellers. I loved STP, Creed (even though I don't like them), Days of the New, and Smash Mouth. But my goodness did the Cult and Train blow! I realize they are not supposed to be Jim or even replace him or sound like him but ugh! I think they just ruined their song...especially light my fire...it turned Pop, like Britney Spears--well maybe not that bad. But it sounded like a cheerleading session! I love the doors sound, and I love some of the vocals...so I will take the good with the bad just to have this! By the way I really must have it!! :)"
4,"A great tribute album, but it could be better","This album has tons of great points. Scott Weiland (STP) has to have turned out the best Doors cover that I've heard with Break On Through. Scott from Creed also delivers, with a spirited version of Riders on the Storm. Aerosmith is another band that really delivers with a good cover of Love Me Two Times.This album was great, but it lacks what I'd consider essential to the completion of a perfect Doors tribute album. The Smashmouth cover of ""Peace Frog"" does not convey the same feeling in the music, and the vocalist does not have the conviction that Jim Morrison had. Light My Fire is also misrepresented in the same manner. If it were left up to me, I would have hired Glenn Danzig to perform a cover of Not to Touch the Earth, as well as Bad Religion to cover When the Musics over."
5,Worth it just for the Burroughs track,"Awesome track. I'd happily buy the album just for the Burroughs track. It's music mixed together with William S. Burroughs' famous voice as he rambles on quoting Morrison (""Blood on the streets"") and then breaks into a discussion of Morrison (""Died in a bathtub in Paris...seems like a g**amn strange thing to happen."")At the end it blends together with Jim's voice. It's a really bizarre but fascinating track."
4,Doors tracks for the 21st century,"Listening to the first two tracks I thought STP and Creed had sampled Morrison from other sources. I liked them better than the ""new"" Doors tracks. The two Natalie-Cole like duets with John Lee Hooker and William Burroughs were low points in my view. John Lee deserved his own vocals, and Burroughs' sampled voice sounds even worse than Morrison's. All the other bands do a great job staying faithful to the Doors yet bringing their own sounds out. And Aerosmith has been officially forgiven for its nerdy last few years."
1,Get this on Napster - buy the true Doors instead,"I'm not trying to advocate piracy, but this CD only has a few songs that I liked (which many other reviewers also said). I am a big fan of the Doors, The Cult, and Creed. On this CD, overall, the emotion wasn't there. On the Storytellers VH1 special, I enjoyed Ian Astbury singing the Doors songs - he seemed to be into it. The singing of Scott Stapp from Creed sounds great too. Days of the New does OK remakes on this CD, but nothing special. The other tracks are frankly crap. They did try original ways of singing classic songs but they just don't work. Do yourself a favor, if you are into the bands on this CD, then buy that bands albums. If you are into the Doors, buy Doors music. If you want this music, I urge you to listen to the clips first (or use Napster) and if you like more than 2 songs maybe you should buy it. Mine will be for sale, it was a waste of money."
3,2 good songs,"I am die hard Doors fanatic and have been anticipating this album for some time. Like many reviewers I am not overwhelmed. It's not up to par with Enconium (Led Zeppelin Tribute) but it has two songs that make this a must for any Doors fan. William S. Burroughs track Is Everybody In, and Perry Ferrell's Children of Night (soon to be heard in every dance club). Otherwise this album is nothing but a bunch of posers acting out their Morrision fantasies."
2,Keep it real with the originals.,"I don't think there should be a tribute album for the doors. They have such a timeless sound that nobody can duplicate. I sure as heck do not own this. I heard it on the House of Blues radio hour. Great radio program by the way. I listened to some of it and after probaly 5 songs I couldn't stand it. It's just not the same. Oh course Elwood Blues (aka Dan Akroyd) was raving about this and calling it essential. BS Dan you know its not true you're just trying to sell a product. The only cool part I think would like is the John Lee Hooker and Moorison duet, and the Bo Didley song. Okay I hope I have made my point made Don't buy this and if you already own some doors CD's buy some Bob Dylan instead. peace out."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I owned this CD before, I lost it and bought it again. This is a must for Doors fans. Track 4 by Aerosmith, Love Me Two Times, is killer!!!"
4,Morrison lives,"STONED IMMACULATE brings the DOORS nicely into the 21st Century with creative covers performed by obvious DOORS fans of considerable talent. Highlights include Smash Mouth's searing ""Peace Frog,"" Morrison/Hooker's ""Rock House Blues"" duet, the ""Cosmic Movie"" DOORS collage, Oleander's juiced-up ""Hello I Love You,"" and Ian Astbury's desyrupized ""Touch Me.""This collection is certain to please lovers of late 60's rock as well as all DOORS fans.TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 71:38"
3,"Pretty cool, pretty cool.","It's not the Doors, but it is an interesting listen. There are two cuts with some Jim in the backround but it is definatly not an American Prayer."
4,Very nice tribute to Morrison's poetry,"My favorites were Riders on the Storm, by CREED, and The End, by DAYS OF THE NEW. A nice tribute, especially to his poetry."
3,"its ok , i would borrow it not buy it!","i love the doors,there music is great but there are only a few good songs on it. some of the artists really messed up some good songs,such as aerosmith , bo diddley,william burroughs,train.the best is stone temple pilots, creed,days of the new . i would borrow it from a friend instead of buying it"
3,Just Another Tribute Album,"This is a typical tribute album. A bunch of big bands, a few old time favorites and the living members of the band in question get together to reignite the ""spirit"" of their band. Blah, blah, blah, if you ask me. The album is a mix of stinkers, bar room covers and one or two decent tracks. I could do without the covers by Aerosmith, Creed and Smashmouth, all of whom make these songs sound just like their own crappy music. STP does a decent rendition of Break on Through, but it seems to wasted. Ian Ashbury and the Cult make the best contributions, however, as these guys manage to have the feel for the Doors music. If you can find this CD and burn it, do it, don't buy it though- it ain't worth it man . . ."
2,Pass on it,"A friend bought this CD and I borrowed it. I'm sure glad I did. I am really unimpressed. There are some good artists on this CD, I just can't tell you what went wrong. Possibly, ""The Doors"" are out of pratice or have lost the feel, but ths CD isn't worth buying. I was upset, because I like Perry and John Lee Hooker. I'm sorry to say that the only guy who does a decent job is the clown from STP. Of course he is heading in the same direction as Jim Morrison, so fine."
4,It was guuuud!,I really enjoyed hearing kinda recent bands cover some of the best doors music. I love the doors and I'm so glad that this tribute was done!
4,Funnier if it weren't so true,"Laugh out loud funny. Like any good conspiracy theory, some solid facts, well observed connections, and a lot of creative guess work makes this a perfect light summer read. As a stay at home dad, I alternated between cracking up at the depiction of how the mind of a married man works and sighing with resignation at the horrors of a life secretly out of my control. Sometimes I even ""earned points"" by sharing carefully selected parts with my go-to-work wife."
5,Bought for my YongNuo flash,"I bought this diffuser based on other reviews around the internet. Like all reviews said, it fit my YongNuo YN-468 II E-TTL speedlite perfectly.Snug fit with no worries of it coming off when rotating the head of the unit.Great replacement for the off brand speedlite."
4,It does the job,"The Omni-Bounce works well for diffusing flash and cutting down on glare. The best feature is perhaps the fact that it is tailor made for a specific flash unit, so it fits perfectly without the need for tape, rubber bands or velcro."
4,It Works Well,"This Omni-Bounce Diffuser works well with my Nikon SB-600 flash. It fits perfectly on the head of my flash unit and performs as expected from this type of diffuser. If you want an affordable bounce diffuser for your nikon SB-600, this is a good buy!"
4,Nice Product,This diffuser works great with my SB-600 although it has almost the same results as the diffuser that is built into the flash. The diffuser fits perfectly over the flash and is a snug fit and easy to remove on and off. There is not a big difference when using it in bounce mode but it's worth taking up space in your camera bag.
5,Must have for External Flash,"The improvement on your external flash images is significant. Instead of washed out, blown out faces with harsh shadows, the Omnibounce softens and evens out the flash for a much more natural look. Especially useful for portrais and best used at an angle. If you have an external flash, this inexpensive accessory is a no brainer."
5,The softer effect in my pictures really does work for me,I got this with a new SB600 for my D60. Works as advertized.Both my wife and myself like the softness effect that this accessory gives the pictures we take.
4,Works as it's supposed to,"Wanted an easy diffuser for my Nikon SB-600 flash. This white plastic fits perfectly, feels secure and does what it's supposed to. Easy to travel with and doesn't look 'funny'. What more can you ask for?"
4,Sto-fen OM600 Omni-Bounce Diffuser,I am amateur photographer and purchased this product with the Nikon SB-600. It fits well and arrived in new condition.
5,"Nice diffuser, really softens flash nicely",Just a couple quick comments on this diffuser. I am not a pro but I really like what this diffuser does to the flash. It allows me to get closer up to my subjects without changing my flash exposure which leads to darker backgrounds. It also reduces hotspots like I would expect. I havent tried some of the small soft box diffusers and probably wont as I really like what this has done.
5,Great fit is main asset,This diffuser works great on my Nikon SB-600 flash unit. The fit is nice and snug plus the close-ups are pleasing.For the price you can't go wrong.SBfledgling
3,Sto-Fen OM600 Omni-Bounce Diffuser,"I don't leave home without it and I use it on practically all my indoor, flash required pictures."
3,SB600 Diffuser,"This product has a good fit but not tight enough so it easily drop off or tilted, otherwise no complain."
5,Great Flash Diffuser,"I purchesd this to use with my Sunpak PZ42X, and it works great for bouce flash. It takes the glare off and gives your subjects a nice soft light. I read about this in The Outdoor Photography Magazine, and it was a must have. It fits a little snug, but that's good, because I won't worry about loosing it. Just remember you are restricting the light of your flash, so you need to power it up a notch or so."
5,Wonderful little thing,"It costs a fraction of Nikon SB-600, but it enhances the overall performance by 50%."
5,Good product,works great to soften photos of people. just be sure to adjust your f-stop to compensate for the some of the flash brightness being reduced
4,Sto-Fen OM600 Omni-Bounce Diffuser,"the Sto-Fen OM600 Omni-Bounce Diffuser is light, durable, simple piece of plastic that fits nicely over my flash.although not as nice as the professional white umbrellas, this gives a slightly similar effect for a tiny fraction of the cost."
4,Expensive Piece of Plastic,"Item works just fine. I just wish I'd shopped around a bit and saved a few bucks. I mean really, it's just a piece of formed plastic. My advice: shop around for a better price."
4,Must Have,"A flash diffuser is a must have to spread and soften the light. A naked flash can provide very harsh, uneven light. This little diffuser works surprisingly well and it's cheap! It fits the Nikon SB-600 perfectly. Buy it, you won't regret it and you'll wonder why something like this doesn't come standard with a flash that costs a couple of hundred dollars."
2,Falls off really easily,"I love the quality of lighting when I use this with my SB-600 but I hate the fact that it comes off the flash so easily. I can't even put the flash on a desk sideways as this will come off. Also, when the flash is stored inside my camera bag with this mounted, 9/10 times it will come off when I pull it out. Really annoying. Why can't they make these so they snap in place?"
4,DOES IT WORKS WITH ANY OTHER FLASH?,"Hi I have a Young Nuo speed lite flash , and I'd like to know if this amazing diffuser fits on it ...Can somebody help me with that? I will appreciate it a lot , Thanks :)"
1,Worst than nothing for eye glass reflections,"With NOTHING on the SB600, I can direct the flash up toward the ceiling and I can get rid of eye glass reflections. With this Bounce Diffuser on the SB600, if I aim the flash up toward the ceiling, I get reflections in eye glasses. The reason being, that when aimed straight up, there is light coming from the side of the diffuser which reflects off of the glass of the eyeglass wearer, without the diffuser, there is NO SIDE light and thus no eye glass reflection."
1,Be forewarned: do not waste your money on this thing,"1. After reading the various reviews on the Stofen, I figured for the price--> I might as well check it out.2. Bottomline: this thing is a total waste of money (thankfully not that much). I'm able to get more balanced, well lit shots by simply using my flash, bouncing it off the ceiling compared to using the Stofen (at varying angles). What's interesting is that if anything, the Stofen seems to focus / concentrate the light as oppose to diffuse it (ie very strange). I'm assuming that if one wants diffused light that is better than bouncing one's flash off the walls, one probably needs to use the various more expensive and bulkier devices that the pros use (ie it's becoming clear as to why the pros use what they do... because they work)."
1,"Great concept, but ..............","This was suggested on the web site under the camera flash I purchased. It does not fit that flash, at all, not even close. I need to return it, which they say they will clearly do, which is a good offer, but the flash itself was a dissappointment, too."
2,Not necessary,You have to stretch it hard first before you can attach on your flash.Never buy this kind of product & it doesn't make any difference.
4,Sto-Fen Omni Bounce,"After using the product for a month, i'm very satisfied about the results. Subject lighting is good and even. Definitely will recommend to anyone."
4,Expensive Plastic!,"This diffuser fits nicely on the flash unit I use and works well, although it's a bit high priced for what it is!"
2,Diffuser does stay on Nikon 600 flash,Nice diffuser but it does stay fixed to my Nikon 600 flash...it falls off during shooting.
5,An excellent read-aloud picturebook to express emotion and boost very young children's self-esteem,"I Love Me is a very simple picturebook expressing love for a child, and encouraging the child to love himself or herself, in easy reader phrases. ""I wish for you to love yourself as much as I love you. / Look at yourself in the mirror and see for yourself. / Say out loud, 'I Love Me!'"" A mirror on one page, a connect-the-dots section, and a page with the words ""I Love Me"" to color add an interactive touch to this positive-minded book, illustrated in warm colors with drawings of hearts and stick figures. An excellent read-aloud picturebook to express emotion and boost very young children's self-esteem."
5,Fantastic!,"A fantastic collection of images of the city of Rochester. Whether you were just a visitor to the city or are a lifelong resident of the community, Riggott's book captures the beauty of the city in page after page. The images are beautiful, timeless and are perfect memories of the incredible city."
3,"Excellent reference for each variant, but little else","This was my first Warbird Tech series purchase and I was pleasantly surprised. As a modeler's reference, this is an outstanding source of details. The developement of all the various sub-types (some ""extremely"" rare) are covered including many photos and pilot's manual drawings. There are a very few wartime stories and fewer still pictures of the P-61 in combat theaters (hey, there ""aren't"" many pictures of night fighters in action). Most of the pictures seem to come from Northrop files, but they are usually large and clear - excellent for figuring out where to place that ""control box"" on the left of the cockpit. ;) If you are looking for markings of operational (as opposed to prototype) aircraft, get Thompson's ""P-61 Black Widow Units of World War Two"" (Osprey Combat Aircraft Series). Between the two of these books, you should be able to find those nagging details some modelers crave. Recommended."
2,Disappointing,"Although the book provides an interesting general overview, it passes over some important details almost entirely. For example, Chapter 5, Armament and Radar, says almost nothing about the P-61's radar capabilities, and instead dwells almost exclusively on it's 20 mm cannons.A book about such an important night fighter should have much more to say about it's radar systems. After all, this is what made the P-61 so important to begin with.Can anybody direct me to a good source of information on the P-61's radar systems and capabilities?"
2,Feh. This would have been great in 2006,The res on the artwork here is less than miserable. The interface is high-tech circa 1996.I'm dissappointed in this purchase. I would have thought it was fantastic when I bought my first PC in 1993.
4,The Merit of ART (DVD),"Even though I don't belong to the art profession and have only very limited knowledge of the arts, I feel the contents are great and useful, based on my discussion with friends who are artists.I therefore bought it for my friends in the arts profession overseas."
1,whaasssuppp,Why is this under Herrmann's listings? If I wanted trance music I'd ask for it. This guy ever hear of copyrights?
3,There is a reason why it was never shown on TV in the US.,"When you think of bad and lazy final seasons, a few shows come to mind, like Star Trek TOS and even, Sliders, but at least those shows had their final season broadcast, Rurouni Kenshin didn't have this.Basically what happened after the end of Season 2, the writers of the Anime ran out of material from the Manga, so they made their own...and out came some easily forgettable story arcs and episodes that just run together.maybe I am being negative after the epic arc Season 2 contained, then going to this lazy stuff, its like going from Star Trek II to Star Trek III.now to be fair, if you view this season on its own, its quite entertaining, meaning if you watch it without considering the quality of Seasons 1 and 2.I would only buy this if you are a completest and want the whole set."
3,Thumbs Up,Just as I remember it from Cartoon Network way back when. Good show if you like Samurais and fighting with a little romance mixed in. Although the music is a little corney at times the show is one of my favs.
4,For younger people but still good.,If you like it when people kick people's a**es without killing them this is for you. There is still killing but not done by Kenshin. Kids can watch this but adults will enjoy it too.
3,wasn't what i expected,"i think season 3 of rurouni kenshin was ok. but it wasn't what i expexted. kenshin's last enemy was supposed to be enishi yukishiro, not shogo amakusa. in the last episode of season 2, they showed totmoe's grave. what is also disappointing is that they didn't show saito. i hope there will be a season where kenshin will fight enishi and his csix commrades. see you later."
5,Classic toons recreated as a classic roleplaying game,"This roleplaying game is a classic: the one absolutely perfect fit between rules system and subject matter. The rules are simple enough to be learned in an hour. The milieu they simulate is animated cartoons, in the classic violent and silly Warner Brothers idiom. There are storylines and characters for those who want them, but both take a back seat to lunacy--boggling other characters or making them Fall Down (you can't hurt a toon!). Wile E. Coyote, Sooper Genius, couldn't have done a better job!"
3,Decent Movie -3 stars,"This movie plot wise revolves around a conflict of two groups :one is shipping out weapons to the bad guys,the other is the patriots who worked for the other group but now refuse to.Okay plot , the fighting takes this movies rating down a bit, see this movie , dont necessarily buy it, unless of course you like old chinese movies."
1,Not worth a cent...,"I bought this data cable for my i450. I received it pretty fast, no complaint there. The problem started when I installed the program on my computer. When I bought it , it clearly stated on the product's specifications that it was comptatible with the i450 among others. When I got it, it did not have my model # on the disc. I did not contact the seller to get it replaced because when I read the instructions on how to return the product, I had to pay to ship it back, and it would cost about the same as the product itself. I am very dissapointed with this purchase... Buyers beware!"
1,Poor,"When searching for an item to transfer info to my phone I hoped it would do as I asked before purchasing, unfortunatley it does not. Not compatable with requested phone or functionality. Poor product."
2,Great Value,THe shiiping on the cable great got to the house fast. That's where the fun ended. My computer running XP would not load the drivers for my phone from the cd that comes with the cable. I have an i836 Motorola. I searched off and on the net for a few days and found Motorola's Website and found the drivers. The other complaint is the phone won't stay connected to the cable. This could be the phone or the cable. But I have been able to print a list of all the phone numbers.
1,Tell me what there is to like about this book?,"I can tell you what I like, and it isn't this book! Too many gratuitous characters, adding serious confusion to an already tangled and convoluted plot. In fact, I'm still not sure what this book was supposed to be about.I think the main thing that destroyed this book for me (besides the nifty example of a deux ex machina ending) was that I didn't like the main character at all. In fact, I didn't like any of the characters!!! If I did start to think one of the characters was at least interesting, she got dropped from the story and a new, unlikeable one would pop up.My friend liked the pic on the front cover and borrowed the book...The inevitable phone call: ""So, when does it start getting good?""'Nuff said."
5,God's Annointing Abounds!,"I received my CD 2 days ago, and I haven't stopped playing it yet. ""There Is A Fountain"", ""Hour of Visitation"", ""Shout Hallelujah"" and ""I Call You Faithful"" moved me to tears of joy in the Lord. This is true praise and worship. God's annointing is on this choir. Listen and allow the presence of the Lord to come down. Your life will be blessed."
3,Not the cheese I crave,"If you are in the camp of Jimi Jamison and crave that glorious cheese-like rock that goes down like a bowl of Lucky Charms with a great marshmallow to cereal ratio, this is not the one. Stick with When Seconds Count and Vital Signs. I would simply purchase The Ultimate Survivor as it has pulled the only songs worth hearing in my opinion. This is predominantly filler material that sounds like bad hair metal choruses and songs that are not memorable after multiple plays except the 2 or 3 on Ultimate Survivor."
5,Incredible,"I'm a pianist for a large Catholic Church in the Nashville Area. I've been playing keyboard for over forty years. When I was young and naive I used to dream of playing with the Beatles or some other icon of pop culture. Now I dream of playing Crucified With Christ with the Booth Brothers which, in my humble opinion, is the most beautiful musical tribute to Our Lord ever performed in modern times. The harmonies, the Soul, the immovable current of a LOVING Holy Spirit pulling tenaciously at your heart; it will take your very breath away. I was listening to this song late tonight as I've done on many other occasions and was curious to see how others were moved by it. I couldn't believe there wasn't a single customer review posted yet. What a shame that I'm the first. Give this song; this CD; this trio a chance. Open up and may the Peace of Our Lord Jesus Christ Be Always With You!"
2,Disappointing,"I had very high hopes for this book due to its title and was looking for how to more cohesively merge Buddhism with management in modern corporate America. My experience is that this book neither explained Buddhism correctly nor did it give good management principles. It was just some light reading and common sense. The meditation exercises at the end of the book were strange discussing different colors of light and using the four elements in meditation all that is needed is to focus on the breathe and observe thoughts without losing yourself in them, that is true meditation, simply sit. This book also focused to much time and effort on the self,which is the very thing we should be overcoming. This is a poor book on Buddhism and management.Keep Looking."
4,Great Introduction to Buddhist Principles at Work,"This book is a terrific introduction to integrating Buddhist principles for Western business people. Part 1 of the book, written by an American business consultant, outlines the approach and discusses the basic tenets and how they apply to the business community. Part 2 contains practice exercises for general issues and specific concerns.An excellent starter book for those interested in Buddhism in the work environment. Probably not appropriate for readers who already have a basic understanding."
5,An overview of terrorist threats to business,"Business Confronts Terrorism: Risks And Responses by Washington DC political consultant Dean C. Alexander provides the reader with an informed and informative overview of terrorist threats to business both abroad and here at home. Alexander also explains the ways in which terrorists take advantage of our ordinary, everyday economic system to finance their activities. He goes on to explore corporate security measures; analyses the relationship of the public and private sectors as they collaborate to defeat terrors groups; and reveals how the threat of terrorism has affected American labor, management, and business in general since September 11, 2001. Simply put, Business Confronts Terrorism should be considered mandatory reading by every American private citizen, business owner, labor leader, and government policy maker."
4,volumetrics,"Makes sense. Recipes are so-so. Agree they meet the criteria, but sadly missing on ethnic foods, except & unless you really like Mex-Tex, and or Oriental & Mid east food.I would have liked to see some recipes for German, Russian, Hungarian, and yes, Jewish traditional cooking. All in all, a worth while approach. Gave the book to my son , who is battling 360lbs. I have adjusted a few of my approaches to dinner, but i cannot spend too much time in the kitchen."
3,"Using it, not sure yet",I am trying this diet after losing weight on Medifast and regaining it. Hope it works.
4,Very Interesting -- and it Works!,Wish I would have found this 7-8 years ago when it was first published.I lost 65 pounds but became stuck for a year or more. This book helped me break the plateau...and I'm on the way down again!
5,Forget gimmicks. This is a sound diet plan that works!,"This diet book written by Dr. Barbara Rolls is one of the very few that is well-researched, honest and based on sound nutrition principles. Many diet books are based on flimsy gimmicks designed to sell the book and do little else! This book stands out in the crowd because of its sound advice and its emphasis on scientific evidence. Dr. Rolls is not selling a gimmick. She is selling a plan for eating that has been shown to effectively reduce appetite in numerous scientific studies. Using the diet plan outlined in this book will help you control hunger and eat less without compromising good nutrition."
5,The Plan That Works,"This is undoubtibly the most sane weight loss/control program ever. Once I actually read the beginning and understood the concept, it made total sense. I tried this after seeing it in Consumer's Report as the #1 Plan where upon it is easy to loose the weight and keep it off. All that is required is to know if the calories of something (food)is lower, the same as, or higher than the actual gram weight. (Both of these are on labels of food purchased). There are tables to help you understand the concept as well as recipes and menues."
3,Don't purchase the Kindle Version,"The Kindle version of this book is riddled with text errors. Many of the measurements are represented as ""VA Cup"" or ""`4-inch cubes"" instead of 1/4-inch cubes, the entire book is riddled with errors that leave you guessing at proper measurements. The book is a great book with great advice but at least the Kindle version is full of errors that make it very difficult to use. I would recommend purchasing the hard copy."
4,Feeling Guilty About What You Ate Yesterday?,"I LOVE the entire concept of Volumetrics... Eat as much as you want and lose weight! Seriously, we can all benefit from Volumetrics' advice -eat more fruit and vegetables, drink more water, and consume fewer fats and simple carbs. Above all else, I appreciated the gentle reminder to forive yourself when you eat things that are bad for you. We are far from perfect, and this diet (and its authors) recognizes this fact and helps us overcome our guilt and anxiety about our shortcomings."
4,Strike Freedom In Action,"This is a wonderful model of what is one of the most impressive Gundams ever built. It has a great deal of joint articulation, and interchangeable parts (shields, guns, hands). Not to mention it has built in lights. So when it's late, you can flip the switch and it will light up in true majesty!"
4,Strike freedom,The Gundam Seed Destiny Strike Freedom with Flash Edition 1/60 Scale Model is great. It was two day of fun as I put this model together and I love the finished product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that loves models.
3,Could Have Been Better,"The story is good, but the book is disappointing. Meg Rhyland discovers she might have a half-brother who is entitled to half of her inheritance. She investigates to determine if his story is true. This is where the good stops and the disappointing begins due to erratic plot lines.For instance, Meg is investigating this man on her own then suddenly meets with private investigator, Susan, at a restaurant. Although the back cover talks about a PI, her abrupt appearance is confusing. What helped Meg decide to hire her? What is her background? How did she find her?Another disconnect is Meg's relationship with her lover Kit. Is Kit straight or gay? What does Kit's sister have to do with the story? What is the point of Kit's alcoholism? How does this add to the main story line? If Meg is truly devoted to Kit, why does she turn to Susan?This is a well-written book, but the asides are distracting. Young missed a true opportunity here."
5,A story of betrayal,"This is a well-written and honest account told from the perspective of a youth who is left to wallow in a foster care system that ultimately does more harm than good. But worse than the system and the strangers are the family members whose actions are unfathomable. If you're looking for a warm fuzzy kind of read, this isn't it. But if you like a story that will open your eyes and make you think, this is the book."
4,wow,i was looking at batts on ebay thay want $30 bucks for the 1060 mlap one so you will save money by getting this works grate charger is cheep but works
3,Speedy delivery,"This item was delivered within a few days.I don't use the car charger but the other charger works just fine. No problems with it as yet. As for the battery, it has to be charged everynight so it is not as good as the original. I give it a three because it loses the charge too quickly even though it revived a phone that had been out of use for months. If you purchase this battery don't just buy one. That was my mistake.Hey you get your money's worth for buying a cheap product."
5,Excellent Product & Service,"I recently purchased a cell phone battery and accessories from SF Planet through Amazon. The items were the lowest price on the web, exactly what I ordered, and being a few days before Christmas, it was delivered on the 24th. Amazing!"
2,Phone chargers overheating,"The battery works OK, car and wall chargers became very hot when charging the phone."
3,My Review,"It is a great product and value for the price they are asking! Everything is great quality. My stars are stuck at 3, but, I would definitely give it a 5 star review!"
3,A little bit dissapointed,"The positive view: The battery is for HTC, works fine.The negative: The traveler and wall charger are for V3 Cellphone, not for HTC as the description says"
1,i fell for this s**t,"nothing works...all it is, is plastic with random wires in it making it seem like it's real..i was pissed when i tried it out...o well right whan can you do..."
5,FAST SHIPPING!,"Ordered this on Friday, and received it on Monday! I live in Florida and it came from California. Unbelievable! Would doing business again anytime."
3,Bargaincell 3-Piece Value Pack of HTC T-Mobile Dash,The Battery was just a little to thick and my cover would not close. Other then that everything else works fine.
2,"Cheap, and built like it. The battery is the hook.","My power adapter died after a week. The car charger is OK, but feels wiggly. I don't have a lot of faith in it lasting too long, but it might surprise me. The battery it came with saves this deal. It has been great."
3,Think about before you buy...,"Bought 7 to pass along to family members in case any get locked out of our beach condo. Product is fine, but finding a metal spot on your car anymore makes this a tough item to really use! Under the hood is about the only place but you need a key to get into your car to get under the hood anymore."
5,I never have to worry about it falling off from underneath the car,"I'm the world's worst to lock my keys in the car, so I got this to put my keys in so I could it attach it underneath the car.Works great!"
3,Check Size Before Ordering,"Like Mr. Howell, I suggest you check the size before you order. My Honda Accord key won't fit--too long and too fat, both. Otherwise seems okay."
1,very cheap quality product,"the plastic covering the cable is very cheap quality and is not by any mean, good enough to be used outdoor. I also noticed that the cable would bend over showing weakness in the inside plastic. Just bad quality overall. Do not get lured by the cheap price of this product and get a cable that will be good for years. It will be a better investment."
3,"good product, BAD packing","This is a great griddle. You can make pancakes twice at fast now.However, I was surprised how amazon packed this. It seems that nowadays amazon packs items with those plastic air bags, which is fine with me. BUT! they don't wrap them around the product you are buying. Here's what they do, get a box, put the product in, put the plastic air bags, and that's it. So, the plastic airbags will serve as a cushion only at one side(who knows which side it will be, who knows how the shipper handles these boxes.)"
4,Great Griddle,This is a great griddle. It heats evenly and makes great pancakes. It seemed slightly less non-stick after a trip through the dishwasher so I hand wash now.
3,Kitchen Aid Gourmet,It's pretty good. Almost exactly what I was looking for. It could be a little bigger but for the price a good buy.
4,The first LP that made it okay for kids to listen to Rock n' Roll.,"Even though half the album was recorded during his time at SUN records in 1955, The rest of the album done in New York in 1956 is just as great! A little too much piano on some songs, but it's still a historic album. I wish they had added a stereo mix of the album. The sessions added don't cover much of the album, but more of the singles he recorded at the same sessions, also wish there were more sessions from the album tracks."
5,Couldn't be happier,"This review will be pretty short, I have had the unit for almost a year now and it has gone above and beyond. Several power outages and a lightning strike and my Plasma, 400 DVD Changer, and sound system are still alive and kicking. Two of the outages ran the batteries to zero and quick check shows that i have only lost .3 percent of the battery output which is awesome."
1,Belly up after a year,"This thing worked fine for a year, then, as another user posted, it just powered all of its outlets down--for no reason. Everything else in the room remained powered up. Fortunately, I use this UPS just for routers and external drives. My computer and more important components are protected with a superior APC backup.This is the second UPS I've bought from Belkin, and the second to barely make it to a year. I should've learned my lesson the first time."
2,Not reliable,"I bought this in January 2006 and used it as battery backup for an Apple PowerMac G5.Using a Watt-Miser, I measured the power used by the PowerMac at about 350 watts and this product provided enough power for an orderly shut-down. That is, until September 2008 when storms knocked out power in my area for 8 days. Once power was restored and the Belkin fully charged, it would no longer provide backup power.I am still in the process of getting Belkin to honor their 3-year warranty, but I was told by Belkin Support that they no longer produce this product. I will update this review once my warranty experience is complete.Belkin's Bulldog software for Mac OS X is also unreliable -- if this product is used with an Apple computer, just use the built-in UPS monitoring found in System Preferences."
1,Way To Many Problems With This Fountain!,"I had this fountain for a 1-2 years and it constantly was breaking down. The slates would fall out because of the bad bonding that they used to put it together. I think about 9 slates fell out. I glued them back in and they held but what a pain, I paid good money for this thing.I also had to replace 3 pumps, yes 3! Very, Very CHEAPLY MADE! Another pump went and I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to fix it and sell it on craigslist but i figured it wasn't worth the hassle plus possibly make a new enemy. So I toss it in the TRASH. I'm serious!I would keep away from this fountain, you will almost definitely have constant problems.I have noticed on other Kenroy fountains that they don't have the best reviews. Others are having problems too. Nice looking fountains but they Break Down!"
2,Waste of Money,"I returned this book right after I received it. The pieces are sparse, and don't reflect what Futura is known for -- the graf history that he's a part of. If you want a real book worth your money, check out 'Dondi White'. It is filled with pieces that Dondi did along with the sketches that preceeded them. It also contains artwork he has done for the gallery setting and is a much better designed book in general. In all fairness, 'FUTURA' does try to get innovative with some of the paper-cutting techniques and material, but that kind of experimentation should be done at the artists' own time and not at the expense of the consumer. I give it one star above horrible."
2,"Low budget and it shows, sadly","Love the meaning behind the movie. The main actress played her part well but others needed more talent. It's odd how some scenes were spellbindingly professional and then suddenly, it was low quality acting. Would I watch this again? Not really, unless I'm super bored and have nothing to watch...maybe. Scenes were too drawn out. Many scenes were cut and pasted from the original Jesus movie, which made it less like a ""new"" movie."
5,Excellent Film!,I have sent this film on two mission trips with my sister -- to Peru and Swaziland. It is a wonderful tool for women's ministry to help them know of Christ's great love and healing power for each of them.
4,Adorable book!,"Book arrived in great condition. Packaging was very well and arrived on time. Great translation from English to Spanish. Book was smaller that I anticipated, but that it my fault for not reading the dimensions on the book. Would recommend to others!"
5,A very hungry reader.,"Thank you so much for the book. My nephew loves this book so much in English, I was very excited to get him it in Spanish. The condition was great (just as advertised) and the price was very reasonable. Thank you for this business transaction."
2,Mr. Jenkins was the only thing I kinda laughed at..,The rest of the videos were on par with old All That skits. Sounds great until you realize that All That wasn't really as funny as you remember it.
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS,"THIS DVD IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. KEL MY HAVE BEEN FUNNY WHEN HE IS ON TV BUT ON THIS DVD HE'S NOT FUNNY AT ALL. THE VIDEOS HE DOSES ARE VERY WEIRD. I WOULD RECOMMENED ANY ONE WHO IS GOING TO BUY THIS TO SAVE THERE MONEY, I WISH I HAD."
1,Leaked!!!,What more needs to be said it leaked right out of the box would recommend to avoid them. Leaked A Lot!!!
1,Lost Product,"I have never received this item, I e-mailed the person who said that they sent the product. But she never put a tract on it. So this is money down the drain. This taught me a lesson."
4,"Old, but still great!","It's hard to believe that it took Survivor so long to rerelease their entire catalogue on CD, but they finally did it, and it's a good thing. I've heard all of their other albums, but couldn't find this one anywhere until now. While it may lack some of the depth of their later albums, it contains some of their catchiest, rocking melodies ever. As some of the other reviews pointed out, this one is more guitar-based than the Jim Jamison stuff is, and at times, it almost has an ""Iron Maiden-lite"" feel to it. Perhaps some people will be turned off by the lack of ballads which infused albums like Vital Signs and When Seconds Count, but if you're just looking for catchy, feel-good rock, definitely give this a try."
1,Where are the handbells????,"Having played the flute, i appreciate it. However, i did NOT buy a selection of music advertized as Hand Bell Ringing to be INUNDATED and OVERPOWERED by flute playing !!! Yes, it is classical, yes it is Seasonal, but in my opinion it crossed the line. It should have been titled Seasonal Flute Music with Hand Bells Every-So-Often in the Background, until you get to cut 17 of the 18 total !!!"
1,Very poor picture quality; almost unwatchable; Doesn't deserve even one star,"I love Robert Benchley shorts as seen on TCM; they are so clean and crisp in picture quality and I expected the same in this expensive Paramount collection. Instead, each short is more faded than the cheapest Alpha video. I've never been more disappointed and would return them for a refund if possible."
3,Benchley Redux,"For die-hard Robert Benchley lovers, this is a must-own even if the visual quality of the shorts leaves much to be desired. They don't seem to have been restored or remastered and look faded and grainy. It's great to have them, nonetheless, and while Benchley's understated humor now seems a little muted, his charming manner and his little throwaway gestures, expressions and delivery are still fun, even if the comedy lacks its original impact. The pieces are amusing if not always laugh-out-loud funny, probably because so many of his ideas have by now been imitated and become comic cliches in the intervening 68 years. These are definitely relics but well worth watching anyway."
4,baby shower gifts,the person was purchased for absolutely loved them. great pricing for snoopy items I also purchased alot of other snoopy items that were perfect together.
5,very cute!,These are well made very cute onsies! I love the old fashioned style of them. Not too thin also! Thanks:)
5,Awesome,I first heard Redeemer on the radio and thought it was so beautiful. I then saw her live on a local Praise television station. Just today I was flipping the channels and saw the video on BET. I think the song is wonderful. I had to call the Christian Radio station in Dallas to be able to get all of the information I needed. Just because I called they decided that they would play it then and there. I think this song is wonderful. Nicole has such a beautiful tone and she has her own style of singing. It is wonderful. Keep up the work Nicole.
5,Anyone read the Gospels?,"I just now ordered this cd mainly for the song ""Redeemer"". However, I listened to the other snippets online, I like some, dont like others. All of you who are complaining about her discussion of race, have you actually read the Gospel accounts of what Jesus said? He talked about everyday life that people could relate to, Nicole is just doing the same in her own way. Each one of us has a ministry, if this is hers, who are we to tell her no? None of us is in the position to tell another what they should do with the gifts God has given them, that is the work of the Spirit. If you don't like her message, don't listen, but I'd suggest we need to hear it sometimes. Remember, the most important thing: Jesus is LORD!"
5,"Inspiring, uplifting, and DIFFERENT!","I just bought this CD yesterday, mainly because of the song ""Redeemer"", which I have fallen in love with since we started singing it in our church choir. But I love the whole CD, and particularly the mixture of music styles. I'm disappointed in some of the reviews which say Nicole is too ""political"" or focuses too much on racial issues. I think God's heart is broken to see how we have divided ourselves along racial lines, when he's the one who created us in so many beautiful colors. And I think he's speaking to us through Nicole's music. Hers is a unique perspective and voice among Christian songwriters, and as a white suburban mom in my 40's, I'm thankful to have myself challenged on these issues as a Christian. It's all about loving our neighbors, which is very much a spiritual issue. There are plenty of other Christian songwriters out there if you don't want to listen to that perspective."
4,Energetic CD,"Nicole C. Mullen is worth it, because every second on this album is terrific. Her rendition of 'On my knees', which she wrote, is far better than Jaci Velasquez's version. 'Butterfly' and 'Freedom' are sure to make you dance."
5,"Beautiful music, Beautiful voice",Nicole does a wonderful job in bridging the various styles of music.
3,Nice blend,"This is a nice blend of southern black folk music traditional gospel, and modern rock ballad-type songs. The only problem I had with this CD is that Nicole aparently tried too much of varing styles. Though its wonderful music, listeners tend to want to hear one style from one artiste. ""Redeemer"" and ""On my knees"" are great songs, but they don't blend with the other styles that are on the CD. It sounds too experimental thats all. I hope the next album is a bit more of one style."
5,Nicole In Control,"I received this CD for Christmas. I have heard ""Redeemer"" on the radio. And that's why I wanted the CD. As soon as I opened the package I played the whole CD. I was truly amazed. My favorites are ""Ready for This"" ""Butterfly"" ""Granny's Angel"" ""Family Tree"" ""Redeemer"" ""Freedom"" ""On My Knees"". Once you listen you are hooked. I taped the CD so I can listen while I drive. I can't wait until she performs live in the Washington D.C. area. I only have I complaint, the first song ""Ready For This"" should have been named ""I Believe In Jesus""."
5,very very uplifting,"I saw Nicole for the first time recently at Grace, Columbus, Ohio. Nicole is very down to earth and she has such incredible voice that I bought her CD. I really enjoy all the songs in this CD. Nicole's music is spiritually refreshing and up lifting. Worth every penny I spent. Try it, you will like this CD. Nicole, can't wait for your next CD!"
1,A FLOP,"The chryselephantine sculpture is disappointingly covered both in content (just worth a couple of lines) and pictures (awful, tasteless and neglected duotone photos). Clearly, the author focuses just on arty sculpture rather than serial manufacture, missing the point of art deco sculpture, a blend of art and craftmanship."
1,Dedicated mainly to Austro-German metal sculpture,"Disappointing book. The title should be Germanic influenced metalwork from 1910 through 1935 to be more realistic. Does not cover the wide spectrum of Art Deco sculpture in Western Europe, deals mainly with European sculpture and metalwork east of the Rhine river."
5,Laugh Your A** Off Funny!,"If you LOVE the first two seasons of Little Britain, you'll DEFINITELY LOVE Season 3. In fact you HAVE to BUY it! You WON'T be disappointed!!!!! I have NEVER laughed so hard. The first minute of the first episode, I lost it and laughed until I cried! Bubbles Deviere (if that's how you spell it) is such a crack up.I love David Williams and Matt Lucas. British humor is so much different than American humor. I'm just so taken back by this whole series, it's BRILLIANT!They introduce a few new characters, that DO NOT disappoint! But the regulars are even more HILARIOUS! Vicki is just as hilarious and Margery is also very funny! oh and don't forget about Sebastian! I LOVE IT!Just watch it, I promise, you won't be let down."
4,Descent into cheap-shot madness,"It doesn't matter that the comedy isn't cerebral. It doesn't matter that it's highly offensive. This series breaks you down to your shameful bones. Indeed, you WILL bare your crude, crass soul.Like an old lady suffering immense incontinence; like a young liberal power couple losing an uphill battle against the brute force of the lowest common denominator; like a hardworking social worker drained by undying servitude to a fat man in a wheel chair and his fallacious claims of disablement......you are putty in the hands......of Little Britain Series III.A step up from Series II, which in turn was a step-up from Series I. The guys really come into their own, with the unwavering support of narrator Tom Baker, the Dr Who veteran turned insane clown...MATT LUCAS (""RICHARD & JUDY"", 2005): ""We try and...eh...constantly evolve - make things a bit more spectacular than before..."""
5,Britcom for those WITHOUT a sense of humor!,"Life in my opinion is not lived until you've watched Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of Little Britain.""Yea, I know!"""
4,Very good for what it is but use with caution.,"I like using this to peel kiwi fruit. It gives a nice clean peeling to the fruit. A regular paring knife will take too much of the skin hence too much of the flesh. But you must be careful with it, I once cut the tip of my pointer finger while peeling the kiwi fruit and it was quite painful. The serrated blades are very, very sharp. Another negative about this peeler is that the skin of the kiwi fruit got stuck on the teeth of the blades and I had to manually pluck out the skin. I think this slows down the rhythm and thus the efficiency of the peeler. My experience is that if you peel ""slippery"" fruit or vegetable like kiwi or tomato, you must be very careful that the fruit does not slip out of your hand when you use this peeler or you might risk injuring yourself just like I did. I usually cradle the fruit in paper towel to prevent from slippage and peel with extra caution."
4,When a regular peeler won't work...,Peaches and certain other fruits and vegetables just don't peel very easily with a regular peeler. This gets the job done much more easily!
5,Oxo Good Grips Serrated Peeler,"I saw this peeler on Jacques Pepin's cooking show and tried it. It works beautifully on tomatoes which my other peeler, the handle was comfortable, and kept my hand from turning black while peeling apples during apple season."
3,"OXO Serrated Peeler - extremely sharp, doesn't work that well","I bought this because I saw something similar that showed you could use a serrated peeler to peel tomatos. The tomatos must be firm though otherwise you'll have a big mess on your hands.But in using this item to peel a cucumber it didn't work as well as my older model - only took off bits at a time and I tried using in different hands/different sides of the peeler.And this is odd because this peeler is extremely sharp - I cut myself on it. Overall, I wouldn't get this one again."
2,Too much talking,"There is more talking in these tracks than drumming music. If the talking was removed and the drumming was allowed to be the focal point, it would be a much better CD."
1,The Need and Blessing of Prayer,"I found the book very wordy, and difficult to follow, probably because it was from the German translation. It seemed to be a rather literal translation and not easily read. Thank you."
1,"Bad translation, Wonderful text.","Rahner is inspiring; this translation is really a ""trot"" for those who want help with the original German. It is not a translation into acceptable English. ""Despaired hearts""? Why not ""despairing hearts""? That we cannot give a name to instead of that we cannot name? Mensch is ""man"" in English only because English has no equivalent to ""mensch."" My prayer group is going to use the old translation called simply On Prayer. My prayer time was spent re-translating and that is not what prayer is supposed to be!"
3,Fruity Loops 3 and FL Studio,Re: Fruity Loops 3 and FL Studio.The registration process for the boxed version is a nightmare. Customer service is nonexistant. I have written several e-mails regarding confirmation of my paid 'lifetime upgrade' and nothing.I would not buy a Fruity product again.
2,Fruity Loops,"The program is probably OK, but registration, updating, and customer service is a nightmare. Customer service, if they respond at all, can take days upon days by e-mail. Ahead should take a lesson Nero. That update process is a breeze."
4,Very enjoyable...,"Loved the Kegelstatt, liked the others...it's hard to go wrong with Mozart chamber music...and Barenboim is a master...especially some of the piano concertos..."
5,Great alternative to wireless,This product worked immediately with no set up other than plugging it in. Where ever I need internet access around the house I just plug in the slave unit and attach it to the computer with a network cable. Speed was as good as plugging in directly to the DSL modem/router.
5,Works great with my PS3!!!,"This was one of my favorite purchases of the year so far. Just plug it in and it works- no configuration required. The only hassle I experienced was that it didn't work in the first outlet I tried. Talk about a few anxious moments. I didn't bother reading the manual to find out what the blinking lights meant. I just tried another outlet and it worked brilliantly.Best of all, I was able to hook up a PS3 in the bedroom. I have yet to experience any bad lag, disconnects, or glitches. Don't wait! Get this product today!!!"
1,Might not work for people living in apartments,"I had high hopes when I ordered this item from Amazon. To my dismay (and as stated by many in reviews) this device is a really poor performer if you live in an apartment complex where home-wiring is a little complex. I ditched the powerline option and got a DLink wireless routerD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router. I had a linksys but this one blew me away with its performance. So if Wireless is an option and you live in an apartment complex, stick to WiFi..."
5,"Easy to set up, flawless and very fast.","Took the units out of the box, plugged the first in upstairs and the second in the basement where Wifi access had been marginal. Worked without any additional setup and extremely fast and stable. This is on a Mac where there were few other reasonable solutions. I would highly recommend this."
5,Directv Video on Demand-a solution,"When I discovered that Directv was offering video on demand I began looking for a way to bring broadband to myDirecTV HR21 HD DVR Satellite Receiver - (HR21700 / HR21-700)]. Certain options were out. I could not wire myApple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Gigabit) MB053LL/Adirectly into my DVR. A Wi-Fi solution was possible but Directv advises against it. So I began looking for a power line ethernet adapter. My search stopped with this excellent kit.Setup was very simple. I simply plugged a 10BASE-T connector into the airport and into the master unit (conveniently labelled by Panasonic). Then you plug the secondary unit into the DVR. Both units are plugged into the wall (hence the term ""power line"" ethernet adapter).No more set up is required and I began receiving Video on Demand immediately."
3,"Works on short runs only, poor panasonic support",I could only use these adapters in the same room my computer was located. I wanted to use it 35 feet away and they would not work. It took nearly 4 hours on the phone with panasonic (numerous cutoffs) to even identify the correct department (cameras) to talk to someone. Their help was that I should buy 2 more adapters and that might work. PCUniverse refused to let me return the adapters even though they were not used and suggested I go back to Panasonic (right). I will not deal with them again. Suggest you run a cable (inexpensive)for a fraction of the cost and guarantee reception.
4,Works ok,"I purchased this unit instead of the Direct Tv wireless unit because the Direct Tv unit did not work with other media such as xbox, wii, netflix or blueray downloads. The only problem I had was getting it to work with the Direct Tv box. It was Direct tv's fault as nowhere in their instructions did it say to turn on that feature in the menu guide. (They wanted you to buy their unit). Eventually I did get it to work after calling Direct tv's customer service, This is much easier than wiring the house even though the download speeds are slower than a wired system."
4,WORKS WELL IF YOU DON'T WANT WIRELESS,"WORKS PRETTY WELL IF WIRELESS IS NOT AN OPTION OR DESIRE, BUT MANY HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE CAN INTERFERE WITH IT LIKE MANY LAMPS. SO THE EXPERIENCE MIGHT VARY DUE TO THE LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE."
3,Go wired if possible!,"Had a difficult cable run I was trying to avoid. This sounded like a good solution. In reality, it is really slow. After using for about a month, I ran the cable and never looked back. This might be OK for some people, but I was looking for better performance than I got."
3,"Easy to setup, but lacks performance","I picked up this device to stream video, and so far it has done the job.The adaptors are easy to setup and the built in speed helped me identify the outlets that lack in performance. (I did my own speed test and compared the results)Overall, however, the speeds seem to be similar to the 802.11g wireless. Therefore, if you are looking for a step up in speed, be prepared to be disappointed. Use these only when wireless is not an option."
5,Terrific product for addressing WiFi connectivity issues,"My daughter's room is in a remote area of our home and WiFi connectivity was always a problem. The Panasonic Ethernet Adaptor was easy to install and provides excellent networking performance. Also the price, verses NetGear, was very attractive.Additional post:Bought a second unit for my Son's xbox360/ very easy to add a second adapter"
5,panasonic powerline adaptor,"This product is as easy as 1-2-3. Just plug it directly into the wall, connect your ethernet to your router and to you computer/gaming system. The product works flawlessly. I like the idea of not having to broadcast wireless, leaving my network at risk of intrusion and not sacrificing the speed. I bought this product to move my desk into a built in area and to connect my xbox 360 wired not wireless. So far so good. I recommend this product to anyone how can understand third grade instructions."
4,internet,"Works great. It have 6 units and using them on a computer (instead of wirelesss) 2 blue ray payers, and 2 directv boxes. I have had these for 8 months with no problems"
2,Performance Too Variable,"When this product is working well, it is very fast. However, it frequently slows down greatly and sometimes fails to communicate at all. If you had a house with nothing else plugged in, I am guessing that it would work great. If you have things like air conditioning, battery chargers, etc., it might not work so well for you. I returned this product using a label printed from Amazon and received a full refund. Amazon has great customer service!"
4,Panasonic Powerline Adapter,"My previous D-link powerline ethernet adaptor could not be upgraded to Vista. I thought I would try the Panasonic adaptor since it was self-synching and required no software. Unlike trhe D-link unit it did not work when the remote adaptor was plugged into an outlet in the same room as my computer. However, it worked fine when using an outlet in the next room, but this necessitated running an ethernet cable between the two rooms. It has been working fine without any loss of synch problems that I experienced frequently with my D-link product. In general I am very satisfied with this product. The alternative would have been to add a range extender for my wireless network which would have been a much more expensive option condering the very low Amazon price for the Pansonic powerline units."
3,Godd Story,"Good story, poor art. Well, that is, the art was bad for the first story arc in the book (looked like a 10 year old drew it), but the art improved in the book's second story arc. Good writing though, and for hard-core She-Hulk fans, it's a must regardless."
4,"Johnny's voice still great, but c.d. too short","This is a very good c.d. with a variety of broadway styled music from Les Miz to Rent. Johnny's voice is as good as ever. I only wish the c.d. could have included a few more songs, especially for the price we have to pay."
1,Minimal Mathis,"I love all kinds of music but most notably music from Broadway shows, especially when a great singer like Johnny Mathis performs them. That having been said, I am not particularly thrilled with this new Mathis CD. While his voice is in fine form, the selection of songs is an odd mix especially the songs chosen from The Lion King, Ragtime, and Jekyll and Hyde. And I was very disappointed in the duet of Seasons of Love from Rent. With the sole exception of Loving You from Passion, I found little else of much interest on this CD.I am in total agreement with the first reviewer of this CD; it is much too short. Given the weak material and a playing time of just barely over 30 minutes, I would steer clear of Mathis on Broadway."
4,"Good News (Mathis), Bad News (Sony Music)","Grrrr. Has a major artist, in the past decade or so, released a CD at such a high price point which is as short as this one (some 33 minutes!)? What, is Sony limiting Mathis' controlled composition royalty fees to a certain number of songs per release? Johnny needs to take his golf club and teach those Sony execs a thing or two. On the plus side, Mathis is in glorious soaring voice here; this endearing, unassuming, generous, nice man continues to get better with age (as opposed to certain other Broadway divas whose voices are stridently heading south). It's a diverse, current set, and it's great to hear Betty Buckley in a big budget setting with Mathis (though there is the worst digital editing gaffe imaginable at 3:43 in the Buckley/Mathis track; did anyone listen to the final result)? Even ""Seasons of Love"", which I think has a pretty clunky melody and rhythm kicks here. We love you, Johnny, despite the brevity here."
3,SHORT BUT SWEET,"What a major disappointment that such a good CD is really only half a CD! It is insulting to a consumer that there are only 33 minutes on this CD, in particular since the total time is not indicated on the cover!"
2,Mathis on Broadway,"What a disappointment! Only nine songs on the album but liking Johnny Mathis and knowing his style, I thought this must really be a good CD! The songs are very mediocre, in style, rhythm and umph! He could have chosen more diversified material. With so many show tunes out there, what a waste."
3,Short and ordinary,"It is not bad, but is also not good. There is not much style in it. Interpretation is plain and uninvolved. The CD is also quite short. Meanwhile, I wouldn't mind listening to it either. It is pleasant enough to serve as background music while you are doing something else. If you are a collector of musical theater music, you might want to skip this one."
1,This isnt a ROMANCE NOVEL!!!,"I purchased this book based on the high reviews but was gravely disappointed .. It had a good start with the ""hero"" Caid who finds Lisette dying and rescues her. Then the plot shifted to a different story after that. Seemed like author was more interested in writing about New Orleans' swordsman than the romance itself! There was hardly any good dialogue between the characters that I found myself skimming the pages to look for them. On rare occasions when they two DID talk ..They conversated like complete strangers! which confuses me because how can they fall in love in the first place?! I found myself just reading about Caid dueling and the history blah blah blah.. This makes a good fighting/action book but for a ROMANCE?? FAILED. Save your TIME and MONEY."
1,Low Quality Sound,"Bought to replace HP computer speakers and shocked at the difference. I made the assumption after market speakers would be superior to the ones that came with the computer 5 years ago, but was obviously wrong. These sound like a pair of answering machine speakers. If you just need sound, any kind of sound, then they are a semi-cheap solution. But, if you listen to Pandora, iTunes, PC video games, streaming video, the Windows theme music when you boot up the computer, these will leave you very disappointed. The Hewlett Packard factory speakers were far superior, but decided to replace since their stands broke ... should have kept them and just laid them on the desk."
1,too cheap,constant white noise in background. I guess that is what you get for 10 dollars. Spend a few more dollars and get something that works.
4,"Basic, but does the job well.","They're pretty basic speakers, but they do what they need to and do it well. I don't use them for anything fancy, so they're a great fit."
4,Great sound,"My kids use these speakers with their Zunes and they seem to have great sound. I've even had to tell them to ""turn it down"". Great price, also."
2,i am disappointed,nice pair of speakers but with out power supply they are useless so the problem was the missing parts they don't work
3,For the money they're ok.,"I recently bought a pair at Fry's and for the money they're ok. If you can find them on sale for say, $9.99, that's even better. I just needed a pair for a small apartment and they fit the bill. I use them to listen to music and watch movies on my Mac Mini and they're fine for that. Compared to a Harmon Kardon, Logitech, or other high priced subwoofer system the sound isn't really that great. But what would you expect for under $20? They're fine for using with an iPod or other portable too. They would not make a good ""main"" sound system though."
4,I bought the Cyber Acoustics 4 Watt 2.0 Computer Speaker System for my wife.,My wife was born in Thailand and she uses the speakers to listen to her favorite Thai music. The sound is great.
3,It needs help,"I recently bought this item for my Tippmann 98 Custom Platinum edition. This is a great part and really helps keep the tank out of the way, but unfortunately the only issue with it is that the hose connector does not fit the Platinum edition hose. You actually ave to replace the entire tank connector assembly with the original so that the hose will connect correctly! This puts tension on the hose, which may or may not be an issue, but it's still annoying. This is why I rated this item a 3, as it is cool, but its definitely not perfect."
5,Enlightening awareness on how to speak to preschoolers!,"Carol Garhart Mooney's book ""Use Your Words"" is a short and easy read; yet, is full of wonderful information on how to better communicate with young children. I recommend any adult who works with, has, or is lucky enough to spend time with impressionable youngsters to sit down with a cup of coffee and enlighten yourself. Your words maybe conveying confusion and frustration to the little ones in your world."
3,Book was damaged in the mail.,So i bought this book expecting a new and undamaged copy. But when it was shipped it was not packaged properly. So when I got it the binding was broken in half. It is still usable but it is also a pain to deal with. On the upside
4,Interesting thoughts,"I don't necessarily agree with all aspects of the book, but it did provide interesting thoughts and alternative ways to think about things. The stories that are included are pretty cute."
3,Flimsy,"The True Temper wheel barrow is not exactly top of the line. Assembly is pretty easy, but don't expect this thing to be able to handle really heavy loads. I tried using it to move some gravel, and it felt as though the handles would snap. They bent and wobbled as I wheeled it across my yard. I was a little worried the thing would disintegrate. I think this would be best for moving mulch or light amounts of soil, but that's about it. I wouldn't trust it with bricks or stones."
2,disappointing,"I found this book incredibly disappointing. i had seen the little radio shack books and figured this contained all those rolled into a big book. well it doesn't. it's agreatest hits and i didn't think they were all that great. more digital than analog and most of the analog circuits are based on chips that aren't around anymore. maybe it's not a problem for someone who knows there IC's but i found it incredibly frustrating. Several times I tried to build circuits but couldn't find the chips. And when he doesn't go into detail about what each component is doing, it's tough to find a substitute."
4,"Clear, nuts and bolts format suitable for all.","A popular title with both students and engineers, this book covers the fundamentals of creating and using many different circuit types and applications. From resistor color codes to complex digital circuits, Mims delivers with consummate style"
4,Nice collection of handy circuits,"This was purchased as a replacement for an older copy destroyed in the flooding following Hurricane Katrina - I was already well acquainted with the circuits described. In its day, it rated five stars. Unfortunately, some of the components used are no longer available (which is pointed out in the text), but most of the circuits are still viable. If Forrest Mims would write an updated version around more readily available components, it would probably rate five stars again."
3,"Nice chronology, but not much bang for the buck","A new DVD from megadeth that compiles the best of the old available videos is a great idea, spanning it over 2 discs to try and complete, great, but ultimately there is always stuff left out. The Angry again video did not make this disc, and neither did 99 ways to die video, both great tracks from the capital years. Also, since this is capital, you miss out on the great sanctuary years and the past 2 studio albums.I also agree with the previous reviewers, the sound could have been better (not mastered in 5.1 surround, still 2.0 stereo), and the video quality is only slightly better than the vhs. Additionally, a few liner notes are appreciated, with full track lists, not just a brief overview. finally, censorship, why?.overall, a needed addition to the megadeth collection, but this could have been the be all, end all of videos. There is hopefully something else cooking in the future for the Arsenal archives that will make this feel more complete."
2,Weak at best...,"If you like watching old style music videos than this DVD is for you. I saw almost nothing I hadn't seen before. The rare ""acoustic performance from Argentina"" is about 30 seconds long. The sound quality isn't even that good. I don't really even get the point of this release or why it took so long. The cover is sweet though and I love the video for Hangar 18 just for the Vic Rattlehead parts. Also, they silence out the curse words. Dave, are you serious?"
1,I'm so glad,After reading some of these reviews about this dvd...i'm so glad that i have all of the old megadeth videos on vhs tape before this crappy dvd cameout and sent them thru the editing room and destroyed them forever!!!! How dare them destroy the classics!!!!!!!!!!!
3,I paid my hard earn money for... censored videos??,"I bought this DVD about a few years ago back when Circuit City was around for 30 bucks (this was long before I started shopping Amazon) and I was stoked to watch all my favorite Megadeth videos on my big screen and it was cool and awesome, so much content and it was fine.. untill I noticed all the beeps and censors of alot of the videos, most notably HOLY WARS, Go To Hell and some of the live performances and then I started getting unpleased, all the ""extra footage"" was just crap interviews, although the easter eggs are kind of cool but over all I paid 30 dollars for this and I got censored videos it just didn't make sense to me at all. I PAID for it and its still censored?? I would say this is worth 10 bucks TOPS if someone wants to buy this and don't mind what their getting then by all means go and get it. Overall its a great collection.. just not complete.."
4,Pretty cool viewing but could've had more,"Arsenal of Megadeth is a good buy if you're a Megafan wanting the majority of the videos and some semi-rare footage but it's not the all-inclusive collection I was hoping for. Some of the song have censors, others don't. I found it a bit comical they felt b-tch needed censoring but c-nt didn't. The Gigantour footage was okay but they cut Peace Sells short. Overall it's a good buy but there are some minor annoyances."
4,"Excellent, but no Letterman's TV appearance","It is a must-have DVD for Megadeth fan. Unfortunately,there was no ""Train Of Consequences"" TV performance on Dave Letterman' s Late Show included, and no ""The world needs a hero"" & ""The system has failed"" materiel as well."
5,Fifth - Bad Boys Blue,"The album sounds greats with all the jucy style of the group. It's nice to listnen at home, in car and when you with your friends"
2,Not for those who want to really LEARN programming.,"The title of this book should rightly be Win 95 Game MAKING!! I could easily see why a book like this would tend to recieve polarized reviews. People who actually wish to learn more about the theoretical implementations of game components are likely to be disappointed in this title. On the other hand those who are intrigued with the idea of producing a game of their own design, but are perhaps only familiar with the rudiments of programming in general, are probably more likely to favor it. Personally, and for the former class, I would recommend the likes of Andre LaMothe's ""Teach Yourself Game Programming in 21 days. A definate oldy-but-goody by any standard. Yeah it's a DOS based book but the theory of it all is very sound and easily ported with the proper supplements."
1,Too outdated and simple,"This book is nice for the advanced programmer who would want to write *very* simple games. If you do not know C/C++/MFC code, learn it first! Furthermore: this book is too outdated because they (for example) refer to DirectX as the 'Microsoft Game SDK' and don't even mention the presence of Direct3D! Do not buy it: I did and I regret it!"
1,"Codes too old, do not work","If a reader use old version of Visual C++ like version 4.X, then the codes provided in the CD may work. But codes do not work with Visual C++ version 6. There seems no place where the authors provide a fix. People using only a new programming soft should avoid this book.Explanation and organization of this book look good though."
4,"Interesting, informative, and succinct.","This book is just plain fun, though it is not entirely true to its title; there are no astounding secrets or revelations here, just tidbits of military trivia that make for a liesurely read. At times, some discussions may be masking a contempt for the military establishment, but this does not diminish the historical and entertainment value for the information. The bottom line: if you're looking for an easy-to-read, abbreviated compendium of military facts, this book is for you; if you're really looking for ""dirty little secrets"", get your own security clearance."
1,Wrong cover??,"I bought this for my retired military husband...what a bummer. This book is nothing about secrets,but just a sortof ""handbook"" on already know, workings of the military. Not a big attention holder."
4,John Elefante-Corridors-1997,"This CD by former lead singer of Kansas, John Elefante, remains an all time favorite ofmine of rock gospel music from the 90s to this day. Nearly every song is great but favorites of mineare ""Where Does Our love Go, Eyes of My Heart and the title song ""Corridors"". I'm glad he has a new CD ""Revolution of Mind"" out of more great songs, as he hasn't exactly had a lengthy discography for such a great artist.I understand he has a studio in TN and has produced recordings for many other artists. His tenor voice is excellent and all the musicperformed is wonderful throughout the CD. Highly recommended from me and if my dear wife were still here,she'd say the same."
3,Great Song.,"This is an album by former Kansas lead singer John Elefante. It has some okay tunes and some good music. The only track that really stands out for me is the song ""Eyes of My Heart"" it is such an awesome song I cant stop singing it. The lyrics on it are just so powerful."
5,Great songs of faith from the heart!,"I waited a long time to find this CD and buy it, based on the radio play of the hit ""Not Just Any Other Day."" The good news is the entire CD is just as terrific! This CD exceeded my expectations ... wonderful songs of Christian faith, very Christ-centered, and exceptionally performed musically. If you like Billy Joel in secular music, you'll feel at home with this CD."
2,Avid Book Reader NOT Pleased,"Have a Little Faith is a book comprised of four short stories with a ""message"". However the stories were slow and uninteresting. If your going to have a short story it should be fast moving and have some good action. Something that is going to engage the reader quickly. This book lacked interesting characters, or theme, and the ""message"" to each story was hardly worth the time it took to read the boring book. I am huge fans of Jacquelin Thomas and ReShonda Tate Billingsley and would recommend readers give their other books a try, just pass on this one."
2,Under-realized game from good studio,"I like what this team does, at least they are trying to take adventure gaming into a modern arena, but they still have not incorporated their own sense of story into their games..The interesting premise does not sustain itself, and the insistence to imitate the cryptic, puzzle based myst game style does not compliment the 3d interactivity of the game"
2,Navigation was nauseating,"I love adventure games and I bought this because it looked like it would have good graphics and fun puzzles, but when I started playing it, I found that the navigation was just too difficult. Trying to move around felt like being on a roller coaster, it made me feel nauseous. There was a point early in the game where you have to approach a podium to solve a puzzle, which I couldn't solve because none of the items would move. Finally I realized that you have to approach the pedestal at the exact correct angle in order to move anything. I had to repeatedly re approach the pedestal from slightly different angles until finally I was ""in"". All of that jerking forward and back was not pleasant. So if you are easily bothered by ""spinney"" or bad navigation, I'd give this a pass. Granted, I'm 49, and maybe it wouldn't bother someone younger, but I just thought I'd give my 2 cents in case it helps someone else."
5,Sentinel Descendants in Time,"It's got to be the best pc game I have ever played ,full stream video,360 video,you can look every were and it's not a move sume were then load video and so on .I hope I can find more like this game .thank you to the programer's great game docdos"
5,Technically fantastic...,"This game has two outstanding and remarkable features. First, there is full 3-D movement throughout those scenes. The images are active and full. Your movement is not instantaneous click and jump to a different angle, zoom or closeup. You actually move through the scene. Second, the imaginative worlds. They are really breathtaking and vivid. These features alone make the game worth owning.Puzzles range from simple to virtually impossbile. Plot and objective is less than motivating and uncertain until nearly the end of the game.Moving about freely in unique and imaginative 3-D worlds is what this game is all about and makes it first rate. It is also what separates it from the point, click and jump adventure games. This is very close to virtual reality."
3,It's just 'okay',"For me it was easy to get stuck without being able to move forward. I love these kinds of games, but the puzzles are too hard for me."
3,visual problems,"I wanted to play this game, it is so beautiful and looked to be just the kind of game I like, lonely exploring. Unfortunately something in the interface used sent my motion sickness into overdrive, after a few minutes my head would be spinning."
1,"Uninspired, unimaginative profiteering on the name of an imaginative visionary","A Tarot deck whose cover image does not show a single sample card? Does that make you suspicious?A brand new Tarot deck whose supposed author has been dead for decades and who never created a Tarot deck? Does that make you suspicious?If neither of those facts arouses your suspicion, then buy this deck. And the Brooklyn Bridge.Alas, the purpose of this product is clearly not to communicate inspiration and insight from the teacher to the student, but simply to transfer $30 from the consumer to the merchant.Dion Fortune is surely turning over in her grave; and if the Society of the Inner Light really believes in magic, that should make them nervous. As well as guilty and embarrassed."
1,This really is bad,"You will probably hate this deck as much as I do (and I'm sure as much as Dion Fortune would). Dion Fortune demanded the best quality they were capable of from her students, this deck is an obscene mockery of the Tarot, the Golden Dawn Ritual Tarot is more in keeping with Dion Fortune's expressed ideas of Tarot and quality."
2,Billy Joel Syndrome,"The album Inside Job by Don Henley proves something I have suspected for sometime now, happy people don't make great rock and roll records. The similarity between the career of Billy Joel and this album are almost frightening. In his day, Billy Joel made some great music. Then he settled down, married a super model and had a kid. His music went down the tubes. Of course, the marriage ended, and the next offering by Billy Joel was Stormfront, an album that could be put up song for song against his best work. So, I've said Billy Joel enough during a Don Henley review. Don is just too damn happy. Even when he tries to be mad it comes across to me as forced."
1,What the...?,"Amazon should have another review option where you can leave ""zero"" stars because that's what Inside Job deserves. I should have know better than to buy this CD. Just look at the title of the songs. Miss Ghost? The Genie? They're Not Here, They're Not Coming? Goodbye to a River? My Thanksgiving? One look at the album cover and you would assume that Inside Job was an album with serious messages. Wrong! I like Don's expressions throughout the CD insert photos. He's all serious and determined. Then, you listen to the disc and you feel as though Don's about to start rapping any second! I still don't understand why the long wait to release this CD. I believe Don wanted an album that had the stamp date of ""2000"" so he can claim he released something new during this decade. Tell you what, Don. Take the rest of your life off from the music career and live off the Eagles ""Greatest Hits"" royalties!"
3,You get the love that you allow....,"The problem with an artist like Don who is so ""current events"" oriented is that his material gets dated very quickly and, therefore, doesn't hold up well over time. Not to say this album is a waste. Far from it. His bar is set pretty high so giving this cd a 3 star rating is like giving other artists a 5. ""For my wedding"" ""Taking you home"" ""Annabelle"" ""They're not here"" and ""Everything is different now"" are all very, very good tunes. And, to me, ""Thanksgiving"" is a letter to the same person he wrote ""Heart of the Matter"" to on his previous album. He's at his very best when he writes from his soul and most of this album comes directly from that source. It's only when he goes on a personal rant that makes some of the other songs irrelevant after a couple of years."
3,Time Takes a Toll,"There is nothing quite like Don Henley's majestic voice, certainly a bit of a timepiece. However I found the albulm to be a major disapointment after an 11 year break. The single that was released is terrible...save your money."
1,hypocrite blowhard is back,"Don Henley has a touched a raw nerve. He gives the listener an idea of what it must be like to be a huge corporate rock whore in the 1980's. Unfortunatly its not 1987 anymore, I guess somebody forgot to tell Henley(his music sounds instantly dated)it's not the Reagan era. The old self righteous blowhard still rants and raves about the same things he always has. The music industry is evil, big business is bad. Which doesn't in anyway prevent Henley from gettin rich from both. I guess it takes a big man to hate the people that made him richer than God. Henley's disdain for the youth of today is embarrassing in it's ignorance. On a closing note the song ""Working it"" sounds like it should be on a soundtrack album for a bad nevermade judd nelson 80's movie, dealing with a crooked wallstreet broker who falls in love and mends his ways to the sounds of dated henley."
5,Henley's Best Yet,"When Don Henley is on creatively, there is none better, and this album is a fine example. This is reminiscent of the best of the hey-day of the Eagles.It has been years since we were given new Henley material, but this was worth the wait. Each song is a gem. One notes a certain theme that runs through the songs of maturing and realizing the more important things in life. It takes an artist to pull that off without sounding corny, phony, or pretentious, but Henley pulls it off.I was prompted to buy this CD when I heard the song ""Taking You Home."" It has personal meaning to me, since, like in the song, I was going along fine until I met and fell in love with someone I didn't know I was looking for. That's what music is all about-when you can believe that a song is custom made for you."
3,Not bad but not brilliant,"Some very good tracks: Taking You Home, Damn It, Rose, For My Wedding, Miss Ghost and a lot of so so ones. I can't help thinking that Don's best efforts have been with Glenn Frey, so if he guested on the album, why didn't they knock up a couple of tunes? Nice to here some laid back acoustic stuff which I think he does best. Voice comes across great.You can't please everybody all of the time. Beauty's in the ear of the listener!"
4,"You can count on taxes, prices going up and Don Henley","Well..... at last. If you're an avid Henley fan you've now exhaled. The minute I heard Takin You Home I said that's and instant hit-time will prove me right. This is one of America's greatest poets and wordsmith of grand quality. I might remind everyone he's outlasted the Beatles etc. He sings his truths and he's put his beliefs on the line - hopefully we will all take time to think about what he has to say. We are certainly doing something like that 'cause there isn't a ticket left for his tour this summer. Darn! Yes I was a little disappointed not every song is his best yet, but he still has it-there is no doubt in my mind. He has other priorities now, if you listen to his words... If I was an American I'd hold this man in great esteem."
4,A Fan of Don Henley,"I was kind of disapointed in some songs but there are a few good songs ""Taking You Home"" was my favorite."
4,Why did this take 11 years?,"This is his best CD to date, better than ""End Of The Innocence""...My biggest complaint is the price. Why is his CD $17.99 everywhere I've looked? Even in Wal-Mart! Does Mr. Henley need the extra money? Best songs are ""They're not here, they're not coming"" (with the country radio jab in the lyrics), ""Damn It, Rose"" and ""Goodbye To A River"" (hey Don, we DO need DAMS ya know! It's just a fact of life for us humans!)."
4,Henley does it again.,"It's worth buying, not as produced as End of. Close your eyes when you listen to the cut Inside Job, are you sure that isn't John Hiatt?"
2,Disappointed,"While there are a couple of cuts that are vintage Henley, I am quite disappointed in the CD overall. A lot of funky sounds are incorporated into many of the songs...too bad...one can buy rap or funk CDs if so desired. Henley should know better. I don't like it when talented artists try to deny their age and heritage. Was neither worth the wait nor the money."
2,song constructions are weak,"whatever you think of henley, he's often capable of supremely catchy meditations on life. on his new album, tho, the songs feel forced, like maybe he spent a little too much time trying to make them sound right. the love songs fair better, although i can't help but think they'd sound best with either solo guitar or solo piano as he sings them to his wife in his living room. the political songs are fine lyrically but the tone in his voice is condescending and lecturing. if i want to be told the stupidity of corporate logos, i'll buy a political pamphlet. worse, the political songs aren't catchy. he should've cut all the lyrics by half and gone for simplicity."
3,Not one of his better works,The latest Don Henley is a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting songs like the foot tapping The End of Innocence or New York Minute but all I got were songs which were quite run of the mill. The album does have its moment in songs like Taking You Home and For My Wedding. I am very sure that Don Henley can do much much better than this. After all he was the man who gave us the classic Hotel California when he was with The Eagles.
1,Dudsville USA,"What a letdown. After listening to the previous CDs that Henley recorded this one is really disappointing. He certainly had enough years to come up with something better. Just because of a sappy scene on ER with Hathaway and Clooney, lets not get too caught up that we can't hear objectively. Maybe he should have waited another year or two until he had material on par with past works."
4,"Literate, mature Henley","With each album, Henley has stretched his songwriting. Inside Job is no exception, with a more mature Henley bringing a new perspective to his work. Standout tracks include ""Taking You Home"" and ""Annabel"" where Henley again demonstrates his mastery with ballads. The social commentary (""They're Not Here, They're Not Coming"" and ""Working It"") is predictable and not especially compelling. However, Henley's ""Goodbye To a River"" is a thoughtful and powerful eulogy. Overall, I would recommend this CD to any fan of Henley's previous CDs and despite some reservations about the social commentary tracks, I find myself reaching for this CD more often than many of my other recent purchases."
4,"New Henley, with some old..","It is not at the excellence of ""End of the Innocence"" or any of the eagles songs, but It does have some good songs, and is good listening, and shows the same ole' ""negative"" we are all going to die Henley, but I would recommend this to anybody who remotley likes henley or the Eagles"
2,Lighten Up,"Having had eight years of his favorite policitians in office, you'd think that the world would have turned Don's way. Guess not. If you're into depressive whining, this one's for you."
3,There's No Excuse for This,"C'mon Don, how many years have you had since ""The End of the Innocence""? This is the best you could come up with in all that time?Yes, there are maybe 5 solid songs here (one of which he didn't write), but the rest is just overblown and overlong. Perhaps part of the fault is producer Stan Lynch's. Someone needed to say to Don ""Hey, this tune of yours just isn't working...it's just boring and generic"". Maybe he didn't have the guts - Glen Frey probably did.Regardless, SOMEONE should have told him, because for about half of this CD, he really didn't know any better himself.I'm a big fan of Don Henley - and for that alone I think I deserve better quality...so do you."
1,11 Years? Don should have used 22,"I am the biggest Don Henley/Eagles fan but I can honestly and sincely say that you would be wasting your money if you bought this album. There is no heart or soul displayed on any of this album with the exception of ""Taking You Home"" which starts to wear very thin after only a couple of listens.And yes, I have to agree with the other reviews that have labeled Don as a hyprocrite. At least if you're going to be bashing corporate America, at least do so with music that comes from the heart, which is something Don has managed to do in the past. But to bash the establishment with music that sounds careless and heartless while being part of that establishment, is dowright imperious and an insult to any fan of his music. If Don was really that hungry for exposure/money, he should have done another Eagles tour where at least he could somewhat justify taking people's hard earned money (even if it costs $100 a seat)."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Maybe it was because the wait was so long, or the hype was so huge, or maybe it was because I've never heard a truly BAD Henley recording. Until now. The jazzy, funky horns make me wonder if Mr Henley is a closet Earth Wind & Fire fan. The man whose lyrics have seen me through many different phases of my life appears to have run dry. I'm glad that Mr. Henley has found a level of contentment in his personal life - but like other great songwriters and performers before him - personal happiness and good music don't mix very well. As soon as I send this review, I'm heading straight for the used CD store, hoping to get a good price for it before their shelves become flooded. Save your money."
1,Whining Don,"It's clear by the sound and content of this CD that Henley's had it. Depressing and whining, save your money and don't buy this in spite of the hype."
2,Major disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed with this CD. I feel Mr. Henley is an incredible hyproctrite, getting VERY rich off of the people he slams in these mediocre songs. As for the music, I think the word ""boring"" sums it up best.A major disappointment."
3,Henley returns,"There are a few standout tracks on INSIDE JOB including 'Taking You Home' and 'My Wedding Day'. I'd call this a safe album, one which Henley fans will want to add to the collection. Probably won't earn him thousands of new fans, but enjoyable all the same. There are no punchy tracks on this album, they are all quite ballad style in nature."
1,This Eagle has become a Lame Duck.,"This album is so boring and so slow that it makes ""Sunset Grille"" look like the Headbanger's Ball. The current top 40 hit is the only song worthwhile. The rest drag on like chinese water torture, each painfully long and painfully slow. Don't waste your money on this one. Too many other great new releases out like Vertical Horizon's Everything You Want.I give it a 1 out of 10."
3,Whining...,The first track is great. And so is the title track. The only problem is the rest of the album gets boring and Don wont stop complaining about the government and big business. It gets annoying.
2,Returned after purchase.....,"Henley has written some good songs on this CD, but frankly, I was bored with most of the music. Because I returned this Cd after purchase, I don't have most of the songs memorized. You will enjoy My Thanksgiving, Everything is different, and song #1 and 2. Beyond that, This Cd is too meloncholy and depressing. His TV special peaked my interest and I took a flyer, but there is not enough good material here(4 songs out of 13) to justify the purchase. Stick with End of the Innocence or The Beast for better music. I think Henly,like many artists, now have an easy, happy life and it affects their work negatively. Sting's latest CD is another example. A happy marriage for these men means dull material for we listeners."
4,the wait is over,"Finally a new album from Henley. I don't know or particularly care how his conflicts with the recording industry ended. I am simply glad that it has ended. I for one have missed his music. (would love to see another Eagles album) I have to say I held off picking this album off for a bit, was afraid of what might have happened after all those years away, but I was pleasantly surprised. Every song on this album is solid and proves that the man is still an excellent music writer. Old fans of Henley (like myself) who are wondering if he'd lost his touch, the answer is no, he's still got it.....so go get it."
5,"My thoughts on ""Taking You Home""","I find this cut to be especially compelling. I love the music which is mellow and sweet, but I most love the lyrics! Most lyrics regarding finding love is usually about somebody who is lonely and ""looking"" or ""hoping"" for love in their life, however, in this song, the lyrics are about a man who had a good life. He was happy, content and not particularly looking for anything until this woman came along! Then it seemed that this woman somehow enriched and added so much more to the already full and meaningful life of this man. So, he's in love and seattles it...he's taking her home! To me, the lyrics just seem fantastic and powerful, not to mention that Don Henley has a great voice! This CD should be brought just for this song alone."
4,Worth the wait,"I have enjoyed this CD very much! It has both upbeat tunes and classic Henley ballads. As usual, excellent lyrics. 70 plus minutes of new tunes. If you are a Don Henley fan, you will not be disappointed."
5,Maybe Not His Best But I Like It,I would like to give ten stars only for the fact that he made another great CD for us. Maybe it is not his best album and I have to admit I would rather listen to Building The Perfect Beast or early Eagles albums. Nonetheless this album is the best he could do at this moment and after a few listens I gradually hooked to it.Taking You Home is a great ballad reminding me of another great vocalist Michael Bolton. For My Wedding and Annabel remind me of early Eagles. Great and relaxing lullaby-like ballad. Everything is Different Now and They're Not Here They're Not Coming remind me of Centerfield by John Forgerty nice country flavored rock. Goodbye To A River and My Thanksgiving might overshadow that Jackson Browne.Full of great vintage music is packed in here. For me it is an ideal CD to play after hearing metal/hard rock music.
3,Two great cuts...,"""Annabel"" - what a sweet, sweet lullaby. That and ""Taking You Home"" make this CD worth every penny."
2,Very Average,I respect The Talent of Don Henley for what he did in the past.but this Disc isn't happening.It Feels Very Contrived.I Feel Like 2nd tier Mellencamp&Springsteen Material from the mid-80's.this was Cool Saying this back around that time period but now it's way after the fact.Folks Have already Heard Rain On The Scarecrow&Born In The U.S.A.The Working Class Man? I think Not.He is talented but it is Wasted Here.He waited way too Long.
4,End of The Innocence Meets Age of Introspection,"How can any rock and roll fan from the 70's deny themselves anything released by Don Henley? I bought ""Inside Job"", on its release date, to if nothing else, enjoy Henley's soaring voice of emotion and his always introspective search. The first track, Nobody Else In The World But You, made me feel that the name referred to my purchase. However, I became more and more addicted with each passing track. ""For My Wedding"", is like peering into the life of one who has historically followed temporal pleasure, yet has now found their meaning of real love. ""Damn It Rose"", is a haunting view of the self-centered pain left in the wake of a suicide. Again...DH hits the mark."
3,Don Henley Grows Up.,"Don has long been an activist, and it is tediously evident on about half of the songs on the album. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Eagles / Don Henley fan, way back to the days of Doolin-Daltin and Desperado. But whatever happened to Saturday Night, and other songs that you could just listen to and enjoy without having to think about the political or environmental worth of a song? Don, lighten up a little!This album has some great tracks like Everything is Different Now and My Thanksgiving, but this is one of those Cd's you listen to for a week and hardly ever pull out again."
5,Classic Henley with a twist!,"I heard ""Workin It"" for the first time and instantly liked it. And then I heard ""Taking You Home"" on ER and immediately knew I had to buy this CD. It is classic Don with some cynicism, but also a new Don who is obviously happy with his life as a husband and father. ""Taking You Home"", and ""Annabel"" are two of Henley's best love songs of all time. I've listened to the CD several times now, and must say I enjoy it as much or more than anything else Don Henley has done.You won't be disappointed if you are familiar with this artist and the high quality of work he produces. His social commentary is also right on."
2,Schlock and Petulance,"Cranky coots like Henley lately've been pumping out overproduced schlock (e.g., the latest from CSN&Y), and Henley proves himself only marginally better than the above-mentioned stink rockers. Tracks like ""Taking You Home"" are quite wretch-worthy, and the only single redeeming quality about the CD is ""Workin' It,"" which is a laughable indictment of a system by which Mr. Henley seems to've benefited quite nicely. Still, the old man's petulance is fairly entertaining, hence the two stars."
3,"Couple good tunes, way too preachy","It's not a bad album--there are a couple really good tunes, like ""Taking You Home"" and ""For My Wedding"". And a few okay ones thrown in. But the rest of the album is filled with songs that are somewhat preachy, espousing Mr. Henley's eco-friendly sentiments. While his goals are admirable, I bought this thinking it would be a pop album, instead I got a sermon on how to treat the environment.So it's a little disappointing--I do really like some of the songs, but I'll probably always program my CD player to skip the rest of the album."
2,This is bad,"I think Don Henley has one of the best voices in music, but that is all that is good with this cd. Way too much preaching and the music sounds so fake. What ever happened to real instruments. This guy doesn't need all the gimmicks. His voice should be at the forefront of every song, but it's the music that is. He is also one of the few that forces you to listen to the lyrics because his voice is so awesome, but the problem with that is you have to listen to these lyrics. There is really just three good songs. I gave it two stars because of his voice, but that is all. I actually gave this cd away. It was that bad."
2,JUST SO-SO,"A fan for more than 2 decades I expected more...one or two tracks may make it...but the rest is just well, so-so."
1,NOT ONLY...,"Not only was I disappointed, but I was left depressed after listening to this CD. The only worthwhile track is Annabel. Though Don Henley is often reminiscing-like in style, this CD has taken this to a new level of melodamatic melanchony - LIGHTEN-UP! (and GET OVER IT! ) Don't bother with this CD if you are looking for more of the ""End of the Innocence"" or ""Building the Perfect Beast"""
2,"If you like music listened through a tin can, then buy this.","I like the Eagles dvd. It sounds clear, precise, and very clean. Well, this album doesn't have it. It sounds muddy, sloppy and distant. The music's fine, but I didn't buy a dts dvd to hear this poor quality sound reproduction.I strongly recommend that you do NOT buy this dvd. Sorry, Don. Better luck next time."
4,Great for travel too,"I actually purchased this set to take along on vacation so that I would not have to worry about the kids. It was great because you did not have to screw it in to install it, it applies with and adhesive. I just took along a bottle of goof off to remove the adhesive residue when we left! The added peace of mind made for a stress free vacation!"
1,Don't be fooled,I purchased this product in hopes of making my home more secure but when I opened the package and pulled out the alarms I discovered that they dont make a sound loud enough to even scare a mouse. They make an annoying sound but its faint even with brand new batteries.
4,bo's hard,"the whole album is pretty much bang'nI jus think he should of had some differnt features like LUNI COLEONE C-LIM ,X-RAIDED T-NUTTY KURRUPT LYNCH ectBUT OTHER THAN THAT THE ALBUM IS WORTH IT"
5,should be platinum....,no one has written a review for this album and i dunno why the clips that ive heard made me want to buy it....andyone else who checks this out should pick it up cuz its worth it
1,Fit is very poor,"I bought this for use with my portable DAC which has a Toslink out. Unfortunately this adapter did not fit properly. I bought two: One would just go into the DAC but wouldn't click or stay in at all; the second one barely clicked but would pop out very easily. Oddly, I tried this on my Yamaha receiver and found that once plugged in, I needed a pair of pliers to remove it- no joke. So not only is the fit very sketchy on different devices, but it is also inconsistent from one adapter to another. And yes, I've used Toslink cables on both devices with no problems at all. Luckily this wasn't too expensive, but I'm still a bit bummed this won't work."
1,Optical Adapter,"I was not happy with this adapter, as it did not do what I thought it would. No sound from the source to sound system. Very disappointed."
1,Doesn't work,"Yes, the other review is right. This will not work, I got it and it does nothing. So pretty much you're just paying for a piece of plastic that is pretty much worthless."
2,Did not work for me,"I realized after i tried using it that i would need an actual audio converter to get a digital sound to analog from my hdtv to my stereo, that being said not sure what this would be used for. So basically wasted couple dollars."
5,A MUST READ,"This is the first book I have actually seen on estate planning that was actually interesting. The stories and letters are captivating. I found myself drawn into the next one without even knowing it. By the time I had finished the book I felt like I not only learned a fair amount about estate planning, but that I also learned a lot about myself. I found myself thinking about what I really wanted to pass on to my heirs (and not so much thinking about the money). Kudos to these great authors."
5,Great approach to a difficult & complicated subject,"I enjoyed the book, Best Intentions, and have given copies to several friends. It includes real-life examples that are easy to understand and addresses hard to face issues well. For those of us 'Baby Boomers' who do have the best of intentions for loved ones we will someday leave behind, it is a good way to start the dialogue and plans for the inevitable."
1,OPEN FLAG,"There is a reason that these flags cost only $5.00....compared with other flags that are $25.00 - the quality, workmanship and finishing are substandard. It will be interesting to see how long they last. I don't give them much time...."
5,Open Flag,"I was very pleased with this product, we bought it for a friend that has a restaurant. The flag they had was pretty worn and I thought it would be a nice idea. I had shopped around for price and couldn't believe how expensive they were, then I went to amazon and was astonished at the price and the product. It suits a very good purpose and was delivered quickly."
3,You get what you buy,"I'm peeved at the limited description and the lack of pictures. The flag is very thin- see-through. It is only one sided- on the opposite side you see ""OPEN"" backwards through the thin material. But you get what you pay for. The better flags that actually say they are two-sided and triple sewn cost upwards of $50 to $75. So I bought two of these flags as I'm sure they will be damaged quickly as they are so flimsy.Can't beat the price, though."
5,"Very sturdy prongs, excellent Amazon service, versatile ring","I had Amazon put a .39 radiant diamond in this setting.The setting is very classy. I wear it as a right hand ring, that is why I say it is versatile. The .39 size worked very well with the proportions of the ring. My diamond is a radiant but as you can see many other shapes will look splendid too. If you are choosing a conservative diamond, this is the setting for it.I highly recommend this setting and also Amazon jewelers. The customer service is very friendly and they speak clear English. They will help you decide on a diamond based on your parameters. The jeweler will inspect your diamond and if it doesn't live up their expectations Amazon won't sell it to you. Be sure to see my photo of the completed ring."
2,Meh...,"Mr jankings is kinda funny, but the rest isnt that great. I mean Im a Kel fan and all but this isnt that funny..."
3,Too Commericial Sounding,"I was really looking forward to this album after hearing their hit song ""stick around"" with its jailbreak video and the catchy yet tough hooks.I wish i could saw that my anticipation was worth it.Most of my disappointment comes from their producer Ray Kennedy who gives them a mainstream rock sheen that is completely at odds with Cody Brauns gritty voice and the bands taut musicianship.Most of the songs revolve around getting either wasted or tough road songs with some heartbreak bits in between.Also i think they need a new drummer he doesn't seem as well rounded as the rest of the group preference to go with empty drum sound with very little fills or energy.I def think this band is going places but i think they do need to work on what makes them different from the rest of the Americana Pack luckily they have the chops and songwriting skills to get there."
3,A Little Disappointed,"This book reads more like a textbook for high school or college. It is very thorough, but lacks enough color pictures to make identification easy, which was the reason I ordered the book in the first place! I have 2 curious elementary school grandchildren who saw a snake near my front porch. We never could identify it using ""Snakes of Virginia""."
4,ain't no love like hip hop love,this CD is a definate MUST HAVE for all lovers of hip hop and jazz alike. just listening to the samples alone is not enough. if you love the music(hip hop) you must cop this album.
4,Jazz Version Remixes! .......,"I jumped on this one after a friend from the ""dirty"" (Atlanta) told me it was selling out down there. Hey...... why wasn't this promoted enough in NY? or maybe I need to listen to the radio more.Not a excellent CD, not really a great CD to me because I have the original version of every track including Tupac, Dre, Outkast, Lil Kim and even Tribe's ""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm"" original CD I got back in 89 with Bonita Applebum on it and I really think the originals sound better. But if you don't have the original recordings, this is the best thing to them. A hip-hop jazz CD at best, but all remakes. I saw some of these guys perform with Jill Scott and they are a great band, but I think they should've put at least one track of thier own on this CD to let the public know they can right thier on material.........."
4,Hip-Hop-On-The-Smooth-Jaz-Tip,A coworker from Philly hipped me to this CD. I first played it in the car with my teen age daughter ~ she LOVED it! We both agree that fusing hip hop and smooth jazz is a great and long overdue idea. I'm looking forward to the next release.
5,Check It!,"Hidden Beach Recordings Presents: Unwrapped consists of the best talent jazz has to offer. The music is spell binding, funky and hip as it combines hip-hop music with a touch of smooth jazz. Buy It!!!!! It's worth it."
5,Just the biznis ... !,"There are things I think I know and things I know I know, and I know that this CD is a must have for all lovers of JAzz and Hip-Hop.Heard it originally on Choice FM, London, phoned the DJ, Kirk Anthony, got on-line an bought it. One of the best buys this year for me. Listen to the samples and decide for yourself."
2,it looks like a good album on paper,"hidden beach is a great label, these are great songs. I was excited to hear this album, but i was disapointed when i did. it just sounds like hiphop muzak. skip this and get anything else on hidden beach, or check ropeadope."
3,Weak,"As a whole, I thought that this CD was a big disappointment. It was promoted heavily in Atlanta and I just expected more. I am wondering how they chose the songs that they covered. Bonita Applebum and maybe Stan stand out on this CD."
1,smoothe jazz meets hip-hop,if you hate smoothe jazz then you will hate this album. this album made elevator music out of all of my favorite hip hop classics. they took my money. don't let them take yours.
4,A Fresh Take On Great Songs,"This cd is a must pick up for anyone that enjoys music to play in the background. The music is soothing, yet upbeat and encouraging at the same time. Sometimes, you just want to listen to the instruments play without any vocals, and this is as good as it gets!"
5,Very different and very nice.,"Being a jazz fan along with a fan of ol' skool hip hop. I was first turned on to this collaboration by a friend and have purchased I believe 6 of the 7 vols. Everyone who hears this that can hear, because some of you are just listening. Know this is something special if you like the 2 genres."
4,A different jazzy groove,"These are not your put-you-to-sleep cool jazz rip-offs of popular R&B songs! Definitely a step up in my book of the music I can relate to. If you like the sounds of Boney James and sometimes just want to bop your head to some Tupac, you've just found your CD. These won't be played on the radio -- it's too contemporary for the average jazz station, yet too laid back for a rap format. I like my jazz fusion funky, so I just found my ""put the top back"" CD for my car this summer."
1,i hella love hyphy,"and this aint it. on a jazz rating this gets deez nuts. so cereal. its subpar wack jazz at it's crapyist. and making hip hop digestible for non hip hop audiences? don't listen to hip hop if you dont like hip hop. hip hop sampling is nothing like these garbage guitars and keyboards over a beat and hook. and if you don't have the musical intelligence to understand that... then i have a pair of kenny g tickets for you.im not intending to be defamatory according to the review guidelines.. but im calling it like i see it. from someone who has little jon next to the john coletrane and duke ellington album recorded on impulse! in his record crate. (read: records, vinyl, albums, LPs)ps, i think i got jipped out of the one star i was forced to rate this."
2,Disappointing and shocking...product expires in 2 months!!!,"I bought this product in June 2009, and I have just found out that the expiry date is 08/2009. I purchased this product with 200 capsules and am supposed to take one or two capsules per day so the product should be good for at least 100 to 200 days instead of just 2 months of usage. I am very disappointed with Amazon from which I ordered directly."
4,Keep on Looking,"Alright. Birdie is great. This CD has some very, very pretty songs. I'd recommend you look into buying it, but NOT FOR FIFTY DOLLARS! How ridiculous. Take a nice stroll, outside is a cool place to be, and go pick the disc up at your local music store. You might even find it used! I doubt that they'll be asking such a price.*OR* go search at Poppolar Records. They have this CD (and the record) FOR LESS than TWENTY CDN DOLLARS!! You want indie? Forget Amazon."
5,I love it,"The Rhythm bible is a great book. its a must have book for all musicians; beginners, intermediate and advanced. the language used in itis simple and easy to understand.more so, this is a book that can easily fit in one's hand bag or laptop bag on the way to work."
1,The Movie That Choked,"A boring 90 min. and depressing to boot. I had to wait in a long ""line"" to get this film from my library. When I finally did, it was a total disappointment. The NYTimes review says it all in a nutshell: ""Harsh and intermittently affecting but oppressively contrived and mostly pointless."" Don't waste your time."
2,There are much better options,"If you are talking a College level course that utilizes this book as the main text, I would suggest that you try to find additional information. You will likely learn more, through internet research and using your camera over the duration of the course, than this book provides. By the final chapter you are left wondering why this book would ever be chosen, as a required textbook. A good example of this is chapter 9, where the majority of text consists of simple musings and references to previous chapters."
4,"order early, it took a few weeks","I didn't realize that it would take three weeks plus, so I didn't have it quick enough for my class, so order quick! Otherwise all is good."
3,It's okay,"It is a nice grater, but find ourselves using the more convenient graters that don't have to be put together to use."
3,It Was Pretty good...I guess,"Okay, I guess the book was okay, but Over all they hardley even mentioned Lacey, really thier were like 15 pages about her and the rest about blue and Elizabeth joinin the volley ball team, and I think (It's my opinion) that it's stupidto mention that Lacey smokes, I mean it will bring a bad example to young readers; Oh, yeah whats the deal with the rad buisness? and all the fake macho stuff, Blue has to do and say throughout the book, Super Surfer DUDE! Please gimme a break! But over all, I guess it was pretty good, but definatley not a keeper, but it's good to read it outta the libary, don't spend your money on theis book, in my case I tottally regret it!!! :)"
4,Whatever,"This book was pretty good, but where was Salvador? He was mentioned only once, and we never knew where he was! Blue is very intresting, but we need more info about him, such as age. Was anybody else dying to know his age? Also, what is happening to Anna and Salvador? They have just dropped off the face of the planet! Now Anna is kinda boring, but I loved Salvador! He is so funny! Bethel needs to get her attitude fixed, cause she is really getting on my nerves. But this book does describe Lacey really well, and why she does the things that she does, such as treat Kristin badly. Good part on making her mother come! Overall, a good book, but loose ends need to be tied up badly."
5,All of the Sweet Valley Jr.High Books Are Great!,"Hey! This is a Great book, compared to #16, which is veryawful,if I do say so myself. But you have to buy this book, even ifyou have no clue what it's about."
4,Great quotes for educators,"This is a small, hardcover book that offers great words of inspiration for educators. Famous quotes from famous people and former educators makes this book invaluable to the educational field. This book makes a great gift for someone who teaches or even an administrator. These crafty little quotes can add a smile to someone's face!"
1,Bad!!!!,"These batteries could not sustain a 5 minute call before the low battery indicator came on. This is after full days charging, even though it was stated that it was compatible with the 2420 model.In addition, it might be coincidental but the instrument started to malfunction after using these batteries and is now unusable and had to be dumped.Very bad buy."
2,Spanish with English Subtitles,"I wasn't happy to find out it was in Spanish with English subtitles, not mentioned online. The movie was so so."
4,Pretty Good.,The film was pretty good not great. I didn't fall sleep. Their was some slow spots but all in all nice eye candy.
4,Clandestinos,"Nice movie, it was somewhat what I imagine. About a jailbreaker guy with 2 friends and how he try to be part of the society but in the wrong way. The movie have nudity and gay scenes but artistic not weird"
3,Older mans influences,Not what I was expecting at all. The story is about 3 unlikely frineds who break out of reform school. One of the boys has a crush on a terrorist and sets out to find his older friend. He builds a bomb to set off in public to gain his approval and is sure this will bring him back. Really about a gay boy with a difficult life who is influnced by some older gay men. Not a completed waste of an hour of my life
3,Ras El Hanout - more curry-like than I'd anticipated,"I love Morrocan chicken and a good Ras El Hanout spice is essential for this dish. I was suprised at this blend, it differs significantly in the balance of flavors from the one I was originally introduced to. This is a much more savory - curry-like spice than the more sweetly cinammon-heavy original I started with. I'll have to try others to understand better if there is a 'standard' for Ras El Hanout!"
2,Disappointing,"This version of ras el hanout has way too much fennel and anise. Almost overwhelming, in my opinion. I will keep searching for a better one."
2,Dissapointed,Did not taste or smell like much of anything. Maybe it was ground a while back and lost its freshness.
3,Found better,"Flavor a bit harsh, like raw masala. I found better at a local high-end spice merchant, more refined flavor, better blended. This would maybe serve in a pinch."
1,Bad!,Did not scream. This is shoddy merchandise that one would expect to fine in a dollar store and still would cost too much!
4,Bought for my husband - Dog loved it!,"I bought several versions of this toy for stocking stuffers (cow, pig, chicken, monkey). By far, the monkey is the most fun. We had ""shoot-outs"" to see who could shoot their animal farther. Great fun for all ages.After the humans had enough fun - we shot it for the dog to fetch. While not a durable dog toy, the dogs went crazy at the screaming and fetched it again and again. We absolutely couldn't stop laughing. Get a few!"
2,Fun but breaks very quickly ...,"I did get a few of these for some office fun, and fun they are ...!Downside; they break fast, VERY fast ... after 2 or 3 shots one of the hands (needed to hold and shoot) simply fell off ..."
4,Cute gag gift.,This is a funny gag gift that is inexpensive. I bought one as a prize for an ugly sweater contest.
1,Save your money,Not worth the money. Cheaply made not easy to use a total waste; only thing stopping me from returning them is because they were purchased as a gag gift.
3,Flying Monkey,"It took me a little while to figure out how it worked. Sometimes the monkey will squal and sometimes it won't. Overall, it was a decent product."
4,Who wouldn't love a slingshot monkey?,"This thing is great. I bought one of these for each of my kids for Christmas and they love it. I love it. Unfortunately, the dog loves it too, so we can't play with them while he's around!These appear to be fairly durable. They are also fairly loud, so be warned."
4,"See, Monkey's can fly.","This flying monkey is one of the funniest things that I have ever seen.Fun Factor: It's a flying monkey. You stretch it, and let it go, and it screams. It doesn't get much more simple then that.Educational Factor: I gave this a 3 mainly because it really teaches it's users how trajectory works. If my physics professors used this in college, I probably wouldn't have gotten a D in physics that first semester.Durability: Not bad, it's still going and I've shot the thing all over the place.It's cheap and funny, it's the perfect toy."
3,Screaming Monkey lost a hand,"Okay, so first off, lots of fun, very loud, and flys pretty far. However, my monkey's hand detached after only 10 throws :( that makes me a sad monkey chucker. I think I'll be able to get it back on. Hell for this cheap, I can always just get another."
2,Monkey Scream,Unfortunately the scream sound only worked the first time.Can it be returned for exchange?
3,fun toy!!,Our teenagers have thoroughly enjoyed this toy. The Flying Screaming Monkey has brought lots of laughs to our house.
1,Bad Product Bad Company,"Monkey flies MAYBE five feet...does not always make screeching noise...tried to get refund/credit and return item but was told on phone with HandHeldItems that they would only credit my account if I would CHANGE MY POOR REVIEW on their website. I am currently disputing the charge through my credit card company. Oh, yeah, it took them 3 weeks to contact me in response to my emails about returning these items for a refund. Hows that for bad business tactics?"
1,Monkeys!!!,The monkeys are cute but I probably won't be using them as Christmas gifts as I had planned. One of them broke the 4th time we tried playing with it!!! Don't want to give a gift of that quality!!!
4,Great Office Fun!,This is actually my 2nd slingshot monkey -I bought the first one for a co-worker and his was such a big hit that I had to buy another.
5,love,love love love it so much fun a nice toy for any age. worth the money it really works and screams
4,Fun but annoying,"I bought this for my wife for X-Mas, with the understanding that it would end up being annoying. Man was I right...She loved it, shot it at me, annoyed the animals with the screeching, and had a blast with it all day long. The slingshot ability (fingers go in the monkey's hands, his arms hide the slingshot bands) works well and you can easily launch this thing 30""+. The screeching effect starts when the monkey launches and when it hits. All in all, it's a fun toy that the wife enjoyed, but it's not going to be a every day play toy, and if you buy it for your kid, chances are you are going to regret it quickly because of the screeching."
1,totally hate it,not as i thought it would be by description so would not order it ever again. too small for adults and too ackward for kids
2,hand fell off,It was a gift and the first time they launched it across the room the hand fell off. Poorly made.
4,Screaming monkey tag anyone? ;- ),"Fun toy to play tag with. The only problem I had was I had to re-tie the rubber tube as the knot came loose and almost pulled out on one of the two I purchased. These are fun toys and are pretty soft if you get beaned in the head with one. Great for kids (of any age) and the price is right - my shipping was more than the toy. Oh yeah, it makes a funky monkey screech when it's sailing through the air. It easily has a 15 foot range and is sized for small fingers. Kids love it."
3,Its ok,Its a great game once you get the hang of it. Luckily there are tutorials and a demo even. They also give you a practice run before you start a real session. Cool game but I would have gotten something else if I knew it was going to be like this.
4,Excellent Calendar,"Excellent calendar, but you can find it for much less elsewhere. I got it brand new for $29.99"
1,not what I expected. No words/writing!!!,"It's just a tabulated thing showing english next to hebrew calendar. For about a hundreds years.It's pointless nowadays, when we have computers.programs like aishluach or kaluach.I can't believe anybody would rate such a book so highly. Or not make clear what the book is in their reviews.I did once see a book with a similar cover that explained the calendar. That was what I was looking for. This was very misleading."
5,Coconut...,"I love coconut juice and meat since that is how I get my daily fat and all the benefits that coconut has to offer. I place the coconut in the freezer and after draining the juice I double bag it in plastic bags, smashing it on the concrete driveway. I recycle the shell and grind the meat with OXO Good Grip Grater. Freezing insures meat and shell separation easily in big pieces which is essential in grinding. This OXO box grater works well and looks beautiful. Plastic container went into recycling on the day of purchase since coconut requires attention due to its shape and hardness when grinding otherwise you better figure on missing fingers. America's Test Kitchen has given their approval as well. Microplane sells a box grinder which comes with surgical grade stainless steel which is superb as well. The best way to get fresh coconut meat in all my foods. Great products. Bravo."
3,Bad redesign,Cooks Illustrated is correct in their assessment of this new design. The grater cuts in both directions and winds up shredding instead of grating. You have to lift the potato or cheese or whatever or you will have a mess. I was disappointed in the grater and didn't know about the re-design when I ordered it.
5,Excellent grater with comfy handle,"I received this excellent grater as a wedding present. The good grips handle is very comfortable to hold when grating. The grater is sharp, easily slicing through things like carrots, potatoes, and a block of cheese. I love the container at the bottom. It is so handy to be able to shred cheese into a container that fits on the grater, then put a lid on the container, and pop it in the fridge. I've trusted OXO products before, and this grater is no exception."
3,grater,Oxo Good Grips Box GraterI am an OXO fan but this is one thing they can keep. Do yourself a favor and save your $15.00 towards a Cuisinart. I would try to grate cheese and it would fall all over my counters; it was just plain messy! Sure it is a cute idea and maybe useable if you dont need a huge amount of cheese. But during the holidays when I was cooking large meals this item had me so fustrated I almost broke it to see if it would work better!Signed enraged cook who retired the grater and bought a Cuisinart!!!!!
5,HUGE OXO fan,"If you've seen any of my other reviews you'll know that I'm a BIG fan of OXO products. Most of my kitchen tools are OXO. There is no exception when it comes to this grater. I use it constantly and it's so handy to be able to drop it in the dishwasher and pull it out the next day to use again. The sealable cup is great to store leftover grates and I love, love, love that it stores inside the grater. I have bought this for gifts for my kitchen tool fans friends."
5,Excellent Grater,"Outstanding product, as are all the others I have purchased over the years from Oxo. Sturdy construction, sharp cutters, great handle, non-wobbly during use. The plastic collection box is fairly useless for me, although that is certainly not a downside. Best price here than I've found elsewhere, too."
3,Handy grater,"This a nice, versatile grater with a handy measuring cup catcher that also has a lid. Mine arrived damaged (the grater is dented and the measuring cup lid is cracked). I didn't want to go through the trouble to send it back, since the grater is still usable, so I notified Amazon about the damage. They gave me a 20% refund, which was quite satisfactory for me. Thanks Amazon!"
5,A Great Grater,My wife purchased this for my Birthday as I do most of the cooking in the house. I had been using a set of graters with plastic edges and they were promising death to themselves or my fingers in the near future. This product has given excellent service and is used on an average of 3 times a week. It rarely makes it into cabinet storage and now has it's own little home next to our coffee maker. Good stuff Maynerd!!
5,great product,"This is a fantastic box grater. The construction is solid, the cutting surfaces adequate in size, and it's sharp. We grate a lot of cheese and use our grater a often. Both my wife and I noticed immediately how well this one works. The non-slip gasket around the bottom lip makes it very steady during use and the little box with cap makes storing any extra cheese a snap, although we almost never have any! The easy grip handle is very comfortable to hold. It is a pretty simple device so it is hard to wax poetic, but this is an excellent product. I am quickly becoming a big fan of Oxo kitchen tools."
5,So handy!,"Another Cooks Illustrated find! And I see many of the cooks on Food Network using this same grater. It grates wonderfully and I love the little box on the bottom for catching the food. Of course you still get some of whatever you are grating on the outside, but all in all this works great and is very convenient."
3,Good quality but cup design not useful during grating...,"When I saw the photo I assumed that the design was for grating straight into the cup. Unfortunately this does not work well as in some types of grater that where the grating surface is parallel with the counter and grated material drops straight into a catching container. With the OXO Good Grips Box Grater design (the cup below the vertical grater) quite a bit of a grated material such as a hard cheese falls on the counter outside the grater and cup. Even if the grater is slanted at an angle to be at a more horizontal angle the grated material is flung outward and onto the counter (or the angle makes the cup pop off). To me this is not an ""excellent"" design as some others have described. Maybe I am missing something?"
2,Handle broke off after 1 month of use,"I bought this grater because of the positive reviews, but within the first month the handle broke off when my wife was using it, slicing her hand quite nicely. My wife and I are not hard on our kitchen tools, which is why I was shocked it broke so quickly, our other box grater we still have and it's been over ten years. After close inspection all that holds the handle to the metal grater is some glue so there is a good chance it could happen to you as well, which is why I cannot recommend this grater."
4,Does a good job,"I replaced my Microplane box grater with this one based on the reviews. The problem I had with microplane was that the plastic kept fatiguing and would crack. They have not fixed this problem, so I decided to go with OXO instead. I don't use it with the container. I did once, but extra cheese fell off onto the counter. You could grate it on a plate or cutting board and put the extra into the container when you are finished, otherwise it's just easier to grate without it. It does a decent job and looks like it better designed than the Microplane."
2,Falls Apart,"It looks neat...catch your food in a handy little box and save yourself a mess, right? Wrong! Food still winds up on the counter, and the box isn't great for measuring things I shred most, like cheese (too much too fast) or lemon peel (sticks to the inside of the grater anyway).My biggest beef with this grater--the handle FELL OFF before it had been used 10 times. It's not well built at all. The box part feels flimsy enough to break as well, but a year and half later, I'm still using it to grate cheese, thus the generous 2-star rating. It's not comfortable, but I'm too cheap to buy another one right now. If you're considering this item, you may want to browse elsewhere."
4,Great Grater,"I was a little worried about purchasing something like this without seeing it in person. However, this is a good product. It's sturdy, has a good 'grippy' handle, and the added container is a nice touch."
1,OXO cheese grater and box,"Very disappointed. Being cheese lovers we just want our cheese grated and conveniently stored so we needn't grate cheese on a meal by meal basis. The odd cutting surface of this grater creates curly grated cheese but requires more work, the tiny box holds maybe a cup of cheese? May as well use the grater each time you need it. I also thought they may have improved the design somehow by compressing the standard 'square' design of my other graters into a rectangle but nothing realized other than it again held less grated cheese. Had we not thrown out our old grater where the cheese holder held ~4 cups of grated cheese I would have shipped this back immediately.For us this device is more of a toy than a functional kitchen tool. Perhaps other users grate their cheese for each use but we use cheese frequently, perhaps every three days so storing was my primary interest as was the usual degree of effort required."
1,Great concept but badly executed,About a quarter of the cheese end up outside the box so I have to grate over a plate instead of the box.
5,Superb Box Grater,"As a long time OXO fan, when my generic box grater fell apart, I took the opportunity to upgrade to the nicer OXO grater. While only a few dollars more than the cheapo units, it is much sturdier, has a nicer handle and comes with the clever plastic catch tray which is a press fit onto the bottom of the grater. And even better, it comes with a separate lid for storing shredded items in that catch bin if you so desire (nice for time pressed clean-ups). A top notch item, and a recommended purchase."
5,Excellent design,"This grater was actually designed with some forethought. It comes with a small container (that has it's own lid) that fits inside of the bottom of the grater. You can pull this container out, flip it around and it fit it into the base so that you can grate your cheese directly into it. It has measurement markings on it (up to 1 cup) which are very helpful and the lid is really nice so you can store extra cheese. The handle is comfortable and the overall structure seems sound, not like it will bend or flex during use. It grates cheese well too."
2,No go,"The ""good grip"" handle is nice and comfortable; however, the plastic container cracked after one use. You can buy a grater almost as good for 1/4 the price. Made in China, this is an example of you don't get what you paid for."
4,A premium grater,"Good overall grater. Now I hope you didn't really believe everything was just going to fall into the bottom container, did you? Only in fairytales, folks. But the container is still good to have anyway, to store leftovers or just as a measured sealable box. The grater is wide enough for most typical applications and is generally a fairly well made product. Expect it to simply work, and that's fine as far as I'm concerned."
2,The container is useless,"I am surprised that many reviewers praise the container box. It is actually quite terrible - you may notice in the picture that it narrows towards the bottom, thus making the whole thing unstable. After a couple of times of accidentaly tipping the grater because of this instability and scattering carrots or cheese all over the floor, I now just grate on a cutting board. The blades are OK, wouldn't say amazing."
4,greta kitchen tool,"This is useful-heavy duty, can put in the dishwasher, safe and easy to use. Quality is great and it's great for pizza making."
5,GRATER,I'VE USED THIS ITEM TO GRATE CARROTS AND CHEESE. IT IS AS SOME BUYERS STATED THAT THE PARTICLES WIND UP AROUND THE GRATER AS MUCH AS IN THE GRATER. YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO USE A PLATE WHILE GRATING. IT'S A NICE PRODUCT OTHERWISE.
4,Cheesy Cheese,"There are many types of graters for cheese that I have not tried. This, in my opinion, is probably the best and most practical of its kind.It is still not nearly as convenient as buying pre-grated cheese from the store. I have now learned that the taste of quality cheeses, freshly grated at home by comparison make the convenient pre-grated packaged cheeses taste like cardboard.It is interesting how one's attitute can be so easily changed. I was formerly happy with cardboard."
3,A good book for review but......,"I just completed a year of graduate level Bio-stats. I thought this book would be a good way to cement the concepts I have learned in my long term memory. First, I would say that any review is helpful and this book is helpful. I commend the author for putting together a book of this kind.That said, I have some problems with this book. After a few chapters I decided to check out the author's credentials. It seems he published multiple books on electronics. The biggest downfall of this book is the authors excessive use of radio frequencies and similar themes for examples. If that kind of subject matter works for you than it will be a great book. Also, the author uses many different symbols from what I was taught. This is not the worst problem in the world but it is a detraction.All in all I gave this book a 3 stars, I feel it is bit generous but there aren't any others out there."
2,Not impressed,"Sorry, but I've seen better example of introdactory courses. Concepts sometimes hard to understand - I needed constantly recheck them in Internet and Wikipedia. Examples sometimes vagues and surprisly seem that author doesn't fully feel concepts as well.Author like kidding but his jokes usually do not help to understand ideas at all."
4,No Mumbo Jumbo,"I fell in love with this text beginning with the review of basic mathematical concepts. I like many others in my age group were weened on the ""new math""(read victimized)and never quite got past the point of communicative v distributive properties. This book on the other hand strives to enable the reader to understand the tenets of a particular area without requiring very abstract thought processes.It's taken me 43 years to realize the term irrational number is connected to the concept of ratio and not the psyche. I found the same teaching strategy evident through all the chapters of this book."
2,oh man...,"When a statistics book is written under the premise of ""demystifying"" and simplifying a complex subject starts off with a chapter on basic math, you know you are in trouble. True, the computation of statistics relies on formulas, but they will not help you understand statistics - in fact, students often learn statistics better when the focus is on the construction of concepts over time, not the memorization of random formulas, most of which will be forgotten in the long run.This book is not entirely useless, but there are so many other better books on statistics. I recommend skipping this math...I mean, statistics book and focusing on them."
2,Not written for mathphobes,"You would think a book that purports to ""demystify"" statistics would be written for people who are math-phobic. This book really isn't. It describes mathmatical ideas with formulas and not with plain english.It's basically just a stats text book."
4,An excellent text book for academics and govt officers but,"not for investors nor traders.As a trading book fan, CFA and professional trader, I must say this is the most informative, knowledgeable, well-researched book on hedge funds I had ever read. It could be a bible for anyone working in a bank or government institutions who need to monitor risk and legal issues concerning the very sophisticated hedge fund operations. This may be attributed to the very strong academic background of the author. However, it certainly goes far beyond the need and understanding of the general investment public or even professional traders like me whose primary objective may just be to profit, and profit. Therefore the value of it depends much on who the reader is and what he wants. No matter what, the quality of the book and the sincerity of the author can be much appreciated."
1,Celtic Women audio CD,"This CD was absolutely lame! Do not confuse it with the group of ladies known as Celtic Woman.They are not the same people,nor do they sound anything alike,whatsoever.I do not recommend this CD to anyone!"
5,Perfectly blunt.,"Uncompromising and to the point, grating but clear, a perfect point of reference for understanding contemporary africa."
2,Ayitteh's Thesis is still Based on Blaming the West,"Ayitteh's analysis is simplistic and capitalizes on right wing trends in the world. Although, rightfully locating many of Africa's problems in African hands, he doesn't escape blaming the west as he sought to do. He conveniently blames black americans (he makes no mention that Americans of other colors also have complicity in Africa's troubles through their apathy) and the West. While rightfully criticizing Afrocentricity for its propensity of fixating on the past, Ayitteh fails to also blame cultural and interpersonal relationships among ordinary Africans for Africa's problems, while glorifying Africa's democratic past. He fails to examine the undemocratic elements in Chiefdom (i. e. such as the capture and selling of slaves to Europeans) legacy on African leadership today. He too easily fixates the blame on a few African Big men and the easy punching bag of the West."
2,A sensationalized account of Africa's problems.,Ayittey has written a thinly disquised traveloque in which he often gets the facts wrong. His subsequent analysis is sensational and overly generalized - it seems to be based wholly upon his pre-conceived perceptions of the continent. Why did he bother going in the first place?
2,Not fresh at all,"I was so excited about the Turkish delight after read some review, but it was disappointing. The Turkish delight is not fresh enough and is too hard to eat. That changed the whole taste of turkish delight as dessert. I'm still very disappointed about it."
3,ok but turkish delight is only great when it is freshly made,i got spoiled in istanbul and ordered some to remember...this brand is the best brand in istanbul....but i think it loses a lot if it isnt made and eaten in a day or so.
4,seems OK compared to Scotch,"Compared to the Scotch clear packing tape that I usually use, this tape actually is a lot easier to start. It doesn't stick as much to itself. However, I thought the tape seemed more prone to wrinkle instead of lying flat when I used it. It worked fine for my purpose of bundling up recycling boxes. Seems like it would be fine for sealing mailing packages as well."
4,"Small footprint for junk drawer, works well.","The tape worked well enough to seal packages for mailing--the roll started easily, unrolled easily, and cut easily on the dispenser. It does feel a bit on the thin side, but that didn't hamper its performance any of the times I used it. I like the small footprint, as it's super easy to fit in a junk drawer, but it also means the roll doesn't have a ton of tape on it."
2,I don't get it,I don't get it why is this tape so expensive.I don't get it why is this tape so expensive.
1,Smells horrible and is very thin,"I've always been a Scotch packing tape girl. I've gone thru rolls and rolls of the stuff, but my local store had this on sale yesterday so I decided to go for it. Mistake. The tape has a very strong chemical glue smell that Scotch simply does not have. The Duck tape is also much thinner than Scotch and tends to fold back in on itself. Not only will I not buy this product again, but I will likely throw the remainder of this roll away."
5,Much better than Scotch brand,"I've always used Scotch brand tape since it's the only brand that my local brick and mortar stores seem to carry, but my last two rolls of it have been awful -- no stick at all. I decided to try this brand, and am so glad I did. It really is frustration-free, while also being durable and strong. It holds packages together really well, and will be my new go-to brand for packaging tape."
4,It is SMOOTH.....,"Yes, I got this free to review, but I could have chosen much more expensive items. I chose this tape because I will be moving and knew I would use it. I HATE most tapes as they stick to each other and are hard to unroll. I must admit this does unroll smoothly and is easier to use than other tapes I have used in the past. It doesn't seem to stick quite as well as packing tape I'm used to, which means I will likely have to use more, but it will also be easier to unwrap boxes, so a con and pro there. I do think overall it will make it easier to both wrap and unwrap boxes and anything that makes moving easier...."
3,"Unique Product, But Made Some Trade-Offs","First, this tape is not necessarily any easier to start than other brands. While the tape does not stick to itself as strongly as others, it also does not stick to the box as well either. Because it does not stick to itself as much, it is easier to lift up the end (once you find it). However, the tape tears more easily than others. While this is good in one sense, in that you do not need scissors or the built-in cutter (you can tear it by holding with your fingers and ripping across), it is bad in another in that it tends to rip unexpectedly when trying to get the roll started."
5,Great Strapping Tape,"I used this to seal up bins with winter clothing/accessories, and put them in the garage. We had used duct tape last year, and within a couple of weeks, it had unsealed, and the bin lid popped off, allowing dirt into the bins. This has held over the last month, and looks as if it will continue to hold. The bins are the standard rubbermaid bin. I will update this review towards the middle of the summer as temperatures heat up.One thing I would note is that the sticky residue doesn't seem to be as bad as with duct tape."
1,Very little tape on roll,This has 1/2 the tape of 3m/scotch available at sams club. I mean VERY LITTLE tape actually exists on this dispenser
3,disappointingly small roll,"I should have paid closer attention to the length of this packaging tape but 22 yards is really not a lot. I typically purchase a different brand and size which seems to be a much better value with less frequent replacement. Henkel brand was good tape, started with ease and sealed packages very well, but I don't feel the value for price paid was very great."
1,"Came off the roll easy, but would come off boxes as easy",Stuff kept coming off boxes. Regret using this vs my normal Scotch version.Cant stray from 3m it seems when it comes to clear packaging tape
4,"Good tape, small roll","This is high-quality moving tape. It sticks well to boxes, and it holds well. It taped up my moving boxes sturdily, and they managed the duration of the move quite well. The easy-start claims hold up to testing- it was very easy to start this roll every time I took it off the guides. That said, anyone who's moved knows that you go through a lot of tape and boxes. This is a laughably small roll of tape for a move. I think I'd need 30-40 of these just for one move. That's just not economical. So, while this is high-quality tape, I would definitely only buy it in a much larger roll."
4,Good packing tape,"I like the smaller roll since I do not do much mailing. It stuck to my box and tore easily when I used it. I'm sure if I were purchasing tape at Christmas, I would want a longer roll, but for general use, it is perfectly fine tape."
3,Not as expected,"The original Algemarin was way more concentrated and a little went a long way. Even so, I'm thankful to be able to get the ig quality, though somewhat diluted."
2,Beware the lack of specifications.,"These are much smaller then I thought. The base the speaker sits on is only 4 inches sq. They are pretty woobly on the carpet in my studio. I won't be able to use these though, because I needed stands for mid. sized monitors, these are designed for miniture sized speakers with not much more then a 4-5 in. base. They would cost about $4 to build and are made from less then a quarter of a sheet of medium density fiberboard."
3,Heroes Bedding,"I received a packaged sheet set with a full size top sheet and twin bottom sheet which was a disappointing hassel. Also, the sheets and comforter are very stiff & itchy. They have been washed several times and are still very stiff. However, the design and colors are very cute."
3,Your Standard adventure game,"It worked on my notebook, despite its 32MB graphics card, so that was nice.The game did indeed have an island, and I suppose you could call it mysterious. It also had monkeys which is always a plus in my book, and a female lead character (another plus). The story line was pretty good, but there was a bit of ""hunt and click"".So, if you're looking for a standard computer game (first person like Myst), this one is fair."
3,If you liked the book this may be for you,"This more of a fan work then a fully dedicated game, If you've read Mysterious island this is kinda neat because you get to see a lot of the locations on the island (although they are far closer together then you would think :). But as a stand alone game, not so great, it's mostly just fan work."
4,Great fun!!,"I really loved playing this game. I thought the puzzles were fun and challenging, and the graphics were really great. I also really liked the navigation. The game was a little on the short side, but is priced accordingly. All in all a very enjoyable experience."
3,I never got to see the ending!,"If you're into storylines, this isn't for you. It's too much about heavy thinking, building things and using your inventory than providing you with an indepth plot and some good characters. I enjoyed the graphics, but it wasn't as good as most out there. I spent about 2 weeks on and off with this game, and when I finally got to the end movie, there was a glitch and all I got was a black screen. It's pretty obvious what happens so I didn't bother to replay it, plus I wasn't into it enough to care what happened. Too much brain work involved."
4,Smart game,"Return to Mysterious is a definite step up in quality gameplay from others I've recently finished--the action is totally non-linear (everything takes place on a small island) and there are multiple ways to solve every puzzle. Players can earn points for creativity and style, which makes the game replayable if you want to shoot for a higher score.The reason for my deducting a star is because 99% of the solutions are based on finding and combining (and recombining) inventory items in novel ways to ""build"" something. OK, that's fine for a few puzzles and I appreciate the amount of thought the developers put into the game, but after a while it began to feel like a long (very long) IQ test. I don't care how gunpowder is made, I don't know how to make cakes out of birds eggs.I was almost happy to see a slider puzzle."
4,Return to Mysterious Island,"I thought this was a interesting game with some real twist, figuring out how to make all the weapons was a real challange."
5,HOT!!!!,"If you think the original song of THIEFS THEME is hot, I suggest you get the remix with BIG L. Big L, overshines NAS in this track. Even though it's an old BIG L verse, it's always good to hear his voice. Two legends at it. R.I.P Big L."
5,A must have for any serious blues lover!!!!!!!!,"If BB King's entire recording catalog consisted solely of the 20 tracks found on this CD he would still be considered one of the greatest vocalist and guitarists ever. Buy this CD, select track 16 and listen to it over and over... then move on to track 17 and do the same. Good Lord!"
5,enjoyable,"product came in good timing, excellent service.very durable and well made, a very fun and cutetoy."
5,Masterful,"An utterly captivating jazz vocal album filled with surprising material and above all, originality. Every track is subtle and thrilling. This is a CD that makes you stop and listen. Not since the breakthrough albums of Cassandra Wilson a few years ago has there been such a deeply felt -- played and sung -- jazz album."
2,"Good Information, Boring to Read","I chose this book to read with very high expectations. Once getting about half way through it I realized it was more like a textbook than anything else. It was very dense with information and was lightened up a little with several stories, but overall it was quite long and drawn on. If you are really looking to use and apply Feng Shui in your life then this really isn't the book for you unless you have the endurance to read it about three times through. It does convince you that this way of life does improve yours, but actually improving your life it does not do. Overall, I would recomend looking more into the subject, but I don't think this is the book to do so with."
3,Sensationalized Horror,"I discovered this book when my friend mentioned that she had read it and we were discussing cults. I looked it up for her to find the exact text that she had read to benefit our discussion. I was disappointed with the work. The authors of the essays are not well-known or even experts in the field of psychology, criminology or religion. Some of the essays provide gruesome detail, too sensational to be considered a valid fact. Despite the citation of sources used to construct the essays, I found the information contained within this book to be less than scholarly. However I find this book qualified to be entertainment for those with a morbid curiosity. I confess that I was sucked into the essays, horrified by what I was reading and prepared myself for nightmares."
2,Bogus pomp from beyond the stars,"OK guys. I'm down with the Emperor and Enslaved. I'm down with Anaal Nathrakh and Immortal. I think Arcturus kicks butt. But Limbonic Art sounds like they're trying to write a new grim soundtrack for that cheesy '80's version of 'Flash Gordon'. Check me out, I'm Ming the Seriously Satanic zooming through the cosmos on a warp-drive inverted cross! I can appreciate the preposterous keyboard work for what it is, and most of the drum programming is alright; though ultimately, LA's bargain bin Dimmu-isms are just silly. I can only hope that Daemon and that other guy only record the stuff that makes them giggle, as they travel about the galaxy on a skull-shaped asteroid.If you want to hear something truly bone-chilling, I recommend the symphonic works of Krzysztof Penderecki. THAT stuff will bring out the raw, cold terror you're looking for."
4,"Up lifting, easy listening","Excellent music - Great for study, relaxation or quiet times with a loved one."
2,REALLY short on specifics,"Talks WAY too much in generalities and jargon, with almost no specifics. The website for the book says they can't give more specifics about, for example, project specification documents, because of confidentiality. That's a really lame excuse for not coming up with a sample, detailed project spec."
5,The bible of Web Project Management,"Not for the newbie producer, but a wealth of knowledge contained in this book. I have been a producer for a number of years now and when making the move to full-size websites, I needed to get more information on documentation and process. In researching I came across this book and very glad I did. From research and scoping to execution and maintenance this book covers all the pitfalls, documentation, and questions you need to plan for when building an Enterprise site. A great book that will stay in my library forever."
1,I must be missing something,"I was looking for a book on project mamagement and after reading all the 5 star reviews I bought the book.The reviewers must have not read any other books on project management or something because I could not even get past the first chapter. Lots of useless info and charts to fill pages. Boaring writing style, gave up and returned it!Get Web Design: Workflow that works by Kelly Goto and Emily Cotler instead."
4,A Good Read,I find myself picking up this book often to incorporate into business or for a refressher.Byron Gileswww.gilestechgroup.com
5,A Lost Classic,"I am one of those thousands who came to Emmylou's music via Wrecking Ball, Spyboy and Red Dirt Girl. I've been recently collecting all her past catalog, and admit that I hadn't expected to like Last Date because I'd read so-so comments and reviews about it. But, repeated listenings find me enraptured with this CD. Harris' music during the eighties was inconsistent compared to her string of 70's classics, but Last Date is, to my ears, at least equal to anything Emmylou's recorded.I listen to Emmylou largely for her amazing voice, and that voice is in glorious form here; the slightly echoey ambiance of the live recordings results in a truly breathtaking sound. The band are great, and the songs are well-selected. For me, this is indeed one of the truly essential Emmylou Harris recordings."
5,"Peak Performance By Emmylou and The Red-Hot, Hot Band","Wow, how could it get any better than this? Emmylou's great, great voice, terrific selection of both old rock n' roll and contemporary pop songs and the absolute red-hot, Hot Band. I'd give it eight stars if I could. This is one you won't grow tired of. Just put it on the disc player, hit the repeat button and enjoy."
5,I keep listening to and singing the songs on this CD,"I am nine and I love this CD. My friends like it too. I keep singing ""Immigrants"" and ""Jingle Bell Mood"". I know that lots of grown ups like this, but kids would love it too."
5,Great Book,"This book is just a must for any firearm enthusiast.there a plenty of pis's and data, for example, all the varitions of the 92 seriers."
4,great book needs better packaging,"This book is informational and meets expectations, but since it was a gift better packaging was needed, like a box"
5,A Great Book For Beretta Aficionados,"If you love all things Beretta, then you will appreciate this superb book. Wilson magically transports you through 475 years of history to Gardone, Val Trompia, Northern Italy, by way of some of the most delightful examples of the perfect blending of walnut, metal and handcrafted artistry."
2,Don't buy it if your looking for facts,"I had hoped this book would provide some useful information on older SO shotguns. The book devotes lots of pages to the subject, but it seems that almost all of the information is available through the old catalogs that are downloadable from Beretta.com. There seemed to be an effort by Wilson and Beard to build more romance and mystique into the Beretta brand, hey guys that's what Beretta has a marketing department for!This is a beautiful book for the coffee table but if your looking for a book with useful data then keep searching."
1,"Not a research or history , mostly PR.","I bought the book hoping it would allow me to learn more about several older Beretta shotguns I own. Other than a table on dates of manufacture in the index, that used to be avilable on line for free, there was very little usable detailed information."
5,can't be beat,"""Fat Man"" is the real first rock n roll record (if you ignore all the jump blues that were fashioning what came to be called rnr)"
4,The book contains solid wisdom with practical methods,"This is a how-to book of enlightenment from a hypnotists perspective. Arjuna gives several hypnosis-type ""induction"" scripts to bring one to an experiential understanding of otherwise spiritual concepts like: Surrender, Self Enquiry, Separation, Memory, God, Higher Self, Right Livelyhood, Desire, Fear and Judgement. I can see this book being useful if you have a partner who you can work with. Probably less effective if you record or buy recordings of the scripts. For some students this will be exactly what they need.The book didn't have the impact for me like the words of Ramana (who is often quoted in the book) Maharshi or Nisargadatta. Arjuna claims to be a disciple of Poonjaji who was Ramana's famous student and has several photos in the book of himself and Poonjaji."
4,A little disappointed,"Arjuna's other work is considerably clearer and more usable than the material presented in this volume. It is, nonetheless, an excellent, but not outstanding, presentation of Advaita philosophy."
5,Bad Azzzzzz,A MUST HAVE!!! I love how they have intergrated Young Justice and the Justice League into this series. Great animation and story line.. I hope they keep this series going.....
1,I'll wait...,Meh. I'll wait for the complete season one box set. This is just more money grubbing nonsense and Warner trying to backtrack after the singles releases.
4,This is where Season One hits overdrive,"Introductions are over, origins have been told, and the team is finally operating on all four (or in this case six) cylinders. Too bad the threats they face have escalated as well. Young Justice is the best DC animated series since Justice League Unlimited, and it probably surpasses JLU technically (animation, backgrounds, color, etc.) if not in characterization and plotting. Any DC fan should pick this up, although DCU purists may take umbrage at some of the changes (remember, it's Earth-16 so the old rules don't apply).So why four stars instead of five?Three reasons:1) Lack of special features2) No Blu-ray option. Animation this good deserves the HD treatment.3) It's only half the season. Sadly, I fear we'll never see full sets (or a 3rd season)so this is the best we'll get."
4,Stronger than the first half,"Young Justice is definitely getting stronger as it goes. Seems that the writers are catching their stride. It's a very adult show, which I appreciate.Really like their version of Dr. Fate - love the pathos.Joker - think I'm ruined for the character after Mark Hamill.I appreciate the growth in Robin. And why Batman says he took Robin in. Very nice."
5,young justice,my rate of this item is great!! fantastic!! couldnt complain about dc comics!!! cartoons bringin our favorite heroes to life!!!! 5 stars!!!
3,Are they SURE it won't scratch?,Maple is hard wood and the particular item I received had some fairly sharp edges on it - until I hit with some 320 grit sand paper.
3,"Mixed, though Rich in Ideas","William Gass proves his remarkable erudition in this expansive collection of reviews and reflections. Although this book is a bit unfocused at time-particularly in Gass' meandering discussion of the history of the spectacle-there are still extraordinary essays on Rilke, Gaddis, Rodin, as well are more abstract commentaries on the nature of evil and sacred literature. Mr. Gass' personal temple of texts is an interesting look at his aesthetic and philosophic influences, without the oracular and hierarchical tone of critics like Harold Bloom. Still, this collection is a bit rich at times-like biting into an overly sweet, strawberry chocolate. However, Gass nevertheless proves his intimidating knowledge of literature and culture without ever losing touch with his own creative commitments."
3,Great Show - Terrible DVD Setup,"There's no doubt that you will almost die laughing while watching these Kung Faux DVDs. They're smart, witty, and so unexpected. However my main complaint is that there are COMMERCIALS! Yes, commercials! Advertisements for various products run two to three times within one episode and then there's about 5-10 minutes of commercials between each episode. Another problem is that there is only two episodes on each DVD, which would be extremly pricey if you paid the full $17.99 Amazon asks for each of the 5 DVDs. I suppose you could say the many extras on the disc make up for there only being two episodes but spending $90 to own the complete series is outrageous!"
3,soap leaked out,"I just hooked up my new one and the soap container leaked all the soap out into the machine and onto the floor before I turned it on. I called Eureka and they are sending me a new soap container. I asked for a new bottle of soap and they said they had none in stock. In my opinion, they should've offered to send at least a couple bottles when it came in. Nope. It's a pain that I had to use the machine just to clean up its own mess, and then clean it out, and wait til next weekend to do my carpets. But I like its features so I'll give it a try.Edited to add that I returned the product because it didn't work well at all."
4,Great for people with kids,I got the carpet cleaner about a month ago and so far I think I got what I payed for. I have a two year old and this carpet cleaner has been a real life saver while living in an apartment. The only bad thing about it is that when I pack it up and put it away the soap leaks out into the clean water container and onto my floor where is has been sitting. I have fallowed all of the instructions on how to store it and nothing seams to help. This is the first carpet cleaner I have gotten and so far compared to the one's you rent I am happy. If you are looking to buy this carpet cleaner please look around to find the best price because the differ from store to store.
2,Leaks a Lot.,"I can't recommend this machine because of its problem with leaking soap, clean water, and dirty water. It also does not suck the water back up very well, especially on hard surfaces. I had to pass it over many times to get some, but not all, of the water off the floor. It will leave your carpet very wet due to its leaking problem. It is also very large and cumbersome. I sold mine on eBay and am now buying a Bissell."
4,Excellent Cleaner,This is a great cleaner. I borrowed my sisters and loved it so much I bought one for myself. I'm surprised by the reviewers saying their carpets are soaked. My carpets dry overnight. I have also used this on my hardwood floors and on upholstered chairs and the attachments work great.My only complaint is the water tanks are small so you have to refill often.
1,This one is a turkey,"I was lucky to get two years of use out of this cleaner. Parts started breaking off, the handle broke and the gaskets leaked water and solution. This machine is not worth the money. Eureka blew off my complaints so don't expect anything in the form of customer service."
2,carpets stayed wet too long,I was disappointed that the carpet stayed wet all day and into the next. I previously had a hoover and my carpets were dry in about 3 hours.
2,My 5th Atlantis....,"Recieved my 5th Atlantis. The others leaked, etc. Gave this one to my daughter since I had bought ""Royal"" and love it.One review mentioned a TAB on the collection tank. Why a tab? I will have to check and make sure it doesn't have one.If the tab was the problem then the service man surely would have known it was there.I had posted 5 times and they were removed. Wonder if Amazon doesn't like my comments?"
1,I would say this machine sucks--,"But that is the problem it doesn't, it only extracted 1/2 containerful of the 2 1/2 containers I used to clean the living room. Carpet wasn't just damp it was soaked took forever to dry. Can't recommend this Eureka product."
1,piece of junk,"Yes, I tried the Atlantis...yes, I used it once, yes, I have a tremendous back ache, yes, my carpet (next day) is still soaking wet..yes, it isn't clean.... yes, I am still looking for a carpet cleaner. This is not easy to maneuver at all.I had a Hoover that worked for many, many years...I'll be headed their way again soon.Eureka should be ashamed."
5,Lost but not forgotten,I was thrilled to see my Uncle's name in print once again (Fred Hughes)! He was and is a talented writer and wonderful singer. Some of his songs were a top seller on Billboard charts and he even appeared on American Bandstand. His soul filled songs bring back memories of how truly inspiring his words could be. Thank you ... for remembering my Uncle and marketing his lost but not forgotten songs.
4,WWE Classic Superstar: Rowdy Roddy Piper,"Once again, comes another great figure. I got it a while ago, and it looks great standing up to the others. It comes with the belt (which looks really cool), a microphone, his kilt, and his HOT ROD shirt. All of these things look excellent. His face though, does not really look like him, and his body is way to bulky. Piper was really skinny. Do not pay attention to that though, because this is still a great figure. He's getting inducted into the Hall Of Fame this year, so again I say buy it (only if you can still find it!)"
1,Crazy Plot,"If you like no plot, lots of incidents, and flat characters, then you might like this book. Otherwise go read Sweet Savage Love by Ms. Rogers and not this clone which is lackluster."
1,I thought this was supposed to be a romance ...,"but there was nothing romantic in this book! The hero was poorly conceived, the heroine a spoiled brat who took pains to prove it. And obviously got it from her Mother. What makes a romance is that one will live anywhere as long as it's with the other. Not Mom! A little dust in her lemonaide and she high-tails it back to France. And wasn't it convenient that while the hero is half indian (scandalous!)he's not of the same tribe that keeps attacking them? I only managed to got half way through the book before I had to find out if it even ended happily. When I read how he felt so bad about her being raped by the indians, but at least he got to kill one of them, I threw the book in the trash."
2,They're all the Same,"For first time readers of Rosemary Rogers, this is a good book. However, Sweet Savage Love has served as the Template for this book, Wildest Heart, Dangerous Man, In My Arms, Tea Planters Bride, Midnight Lady, ETC. Steve Morgan and Ginny Brandon's story and character are retold in each of these books with slight variations. Angela Lindsay (heroine of this book) is a watered down version of Ginny Brandon. I recommend Wildest Heart, and Sweet Savage Love, but just remember it doesn't matter which one you read, they're all the same."
3,Works OK; doesn't last as long as I hoped.,"Not a terrible battery, but it didn't feel like a new one. It gave maybe an hour or two of power before losing the charge. I haven't used the laptop a lot since I bought the battery, but I'm *reasonably* happy."
2,Not What I Expected,"I didn't think twice about getting this CD. I own every Club Mix CD since 1995, I've always been very satisfied, and this CD already had a few titles that I was familiar with, i.e. Blood is Pumpin, Feel the Beat, Played A Live, The Lonely One. This is the High NRG Music I was looking for, I assumed the entire CD had the same power and energy. Unfortunately, there are only about 8 real heart pumping tunes on this CD, the rest is mainly trance, and synth. If that is what you are looking for than this CD is for you. But if you are looking for pounding Club Music, you might be disappointed... I was."
5,"Great Klezmer, but not that swinging","After reading the readers' reviews of this record, I expected something more swinging (like Benny Goodman plays Klezmer). Instead, the rhythms are very European-traditional sounding. That's not a bad thing; I love this album too. Dave Tarras' clarinet playing is impeccable and Sam Musiker's arrangements are great. If you want to hear a more swinging approach to Klezmer, try Mickey Katz: Simcha Time."
2,CUTE ITEM - BUT A SMALL PROBLEM,"I HAVE THE BEDDING SET, MOBILE AND AN EXTRA VALANCE. I DECIDED TO ORDER THE SHELF TO MATCH WITH THE BEDDING. WHEN THE PACKAGE ARRIVED I OPENED IT UP AND THE SHELF HAD 2 SMALL DINGS ON THE FRONT OF IT. I TRIED TO HOLD IT UP TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE NOTICEABLE AND THEY WOULD AS THEY ARE ON THE VERY FRONT. SO I SENT IT BACK AND HAD A NEW ONE SHIPPED. AFTER OPENING THE SECOND ONE IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. SO I HAD SO SEND THAT BACK TOO AND JUST WANTED A REFUND - I DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP GETTING NEW ONES JUST TO OPEN THEM AND FIND THAT THEY WERE DEFECTIVE. I AM NOT SURE WHY IT WAS LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS VERY WELL PACKAGED."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"Fantastic--with one possible issue. Nicely ""weighty"". Smooth handles. Absolutely gorgeous.Easy to install. May be partially assembled. Easy to install after reading instructions.The one problem is that the handle sticks out more than the original handle of a standard sliding door. The screen door handle grazes the handle. I have to push the screen door outwards and then slide the door past it. I would sooner replace the screen door or remove it than replace this door handle.It has been everything I have been looking for."
2,Be Warned!,"It is PRINTABLE CD-R however, if you're like me who'd like to print on the CD label, you will be HIGHLY disappointed like myself when you find out the shiny surface on the CD-R will NOT allow whatever you print on the label. The ink will COME OFF!What's the point of printable CD-R if you can not use your printer to make a professional label??"
1,Silent Hill 4 is Horrible,"I am an enormous fan of Silent Hill 2 and Silent 3, but Silent Hill 4 is not the same. The controls are so ridiculous that I turned the game off after 15 minutes from frustration and I doubt that I will be playing it again. Very disappointing."
4,An interesting departure,"I actually really like this silent game. It's quite a departure from the Silent Hill series, but it is still awesome. I like the fact that your room serves as a weigh station and yet it isn't completely safe. The other areas, are well done and interesting."
3,Fun But....,"I bought this game for my son and youngest daughter to play. They loved it to begin with but it is just the same things over and over again. Level one just repeats itself just adding a few twists. They eventually gave up on it because of boredom. It is full of the Silent Hill thrill and excitement so go ahead, give it a try."
4,Excellent Replacement or New Sub Amp,"I could have repaired the amp that was in my KLH Sub but to replace the capacitor and gain switch, the unit did not work well from the getgo. This was a perfect replacement. It was a perfect fit with one minor adjustment to a connector for the speaker. The sound and adjustibility is perfect. I also like the heat syncs to keep it running cooler."
4,"Received, Transgressed, Transmitted and APPRECIATED!","Nectarine #9 have a fuzzy guitar and vocal sound that reflects the pouting sexuality of Mick Jagger, the hazy atmospherics of The Verve, and the quirky smugness of Pavement. A varied and well-produced downtempo album."
5,Big Bill's #6 of 2001,"Advanced listening for intelligent people. Very unique sound with a cool flow. Unlike many obscure bands that take a while to get used to, Nectarine No. 9 is a hit immediately. Combine the best elements of; (and these are great albums) The Beatles-Revolver, T.Rex-The Slider, Pavement-Slanted and Enchanted, and Stereolab-Mars Audiac Quintet with a form of music never before even thought of and that's what you have here. The four albums listed above are considered all-time greats, there's good reason to think that this CD may be considered an all-time great as well someday."
4,Beautiful melody beautiful words,the music of yesterday is gone but not forgotten as the music of today which is non melodic words that are bland no feelinjgThis Cd was worth the money .
4,Suspenseful & Informative,"Paranoia is a taut, compelling read from start to finish. The narrator, Chad Carver, is an ordinary guy who's pulled into a nightmare world of conspiracy theories. When his long missing brother Palmer re-enters his life and tells him that the Illuminati, an immensely powerful group of conspirators, are about to kill the president and then committ further atrocities against the population, Chad must decide whether or not to believe him. Paranoia weaves many fascinating facts about actual conspiracies into the plot, enticing readers to do their own research. The novel is aptly named, for Dilouie manages to capture the essence of that state --the reader, like Chad, has no idea until the final pages who or what is to be believed. Readers of The Illuminatus Trilogy (by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea) will especially appreciate this book, though it's also a good introduction to the intriguing but frightening realm of conspiracy theories."
4,The new Catcher in the Rye...,"Quite a good book- just finished the other day. Verythought provoking, but from a different perspective,one that says to the reader, ""I'm going to make You aconspiracy theorist..."". It's almost as though thisis the type of book that would replace the book forthe people who always need The Catcher in the Rye, inthat it truly touches the reader, and brings out a newenlightenment on life, even for those who areconspiracy theorists. The spooks who needed Catcher as their safe-haven, does this novel bring out that feeling, emotion, and security blanket? We will see..."
4,Paranoia....who me.....stop looking at me...,"I love the idea of the book as I am drawn in by some of these theories. The author did a good job with grabing you early and not letting go. The book was very fast paced and I finished it quickly, a real page turner. The only issue that I had with the book is I thought the story unraveled too quickly and I had it figured out early.This was a fun read and very ""movie"" like."
3,Small bowls,OXO Good Grips 4-Piece Prep Bowl Set with LidsI guess I could have read the description for the size of the bowls but they are so small that they aren't that useful. holds a couple of eggs to mix. If you need larger than that too bad.
3,Smaller than imagined but good storage bowls,"I,like others,did not read the description completely and was surprised when I received these as they are a lot smaller than I thought they would be....but they were still a great price. I can use them for storage and for prep and mixing small items. I will read a little better in the future..."
3,okay,I thought these were bigger. They are nice but so small. Probably would be great to put a snack in for your childs lunch.
5,Great book!,This book has some very scary stories. Unfortunately they are all true. We have to be prepared for anything and this book explains how having a gun can determine life or death situations.
4,Lots of Insight,"Having read Chris's Concealed Carry Manual, I have been looking forward to ""Thank God I Had A Gun""The stories cover how citizens can protect themselves, against the bad guys of the world, in many cases without having to fire a single shot.I would recommend this book to anyone that is considering carrying a a firearm, or anyone that already is licensed for CCW"
5,wake-up call,"this book needs to be read by people that are not total anti-gun but think the police can ""save"" them. Learn that the gun is just a tool with a job to do,learn to use it like you would any other tool."
5,I could not put this book down,"If you have any thought that you might want a gun for self defense, this book is a must read. If you think you would never need to defend yourself with a gun, this book an absolutely essential reading.I couldn't put it down. These are real stories about real people. Some who were anti-self-defense-gun before their incident-- some were already gun fans.Trust me. You will be enthralled. Read it."
2,it's okay,I have one of these cases and have been using it for awhile. I was disapointed in the fact that it did not protect my screen like I thought that it would. I carry my ipod in my pocket and it bumps into my keys and cell phone and I have found that the ipod screen under the plastic screen still got scratch up a little. It is better than not having something to protect it but next time I will look around more for a better design.
4,quick delivery - great no Ipad,"Love watching it. Show has stopped once or twice, where I have to begin again - not sure why. Internet connection could always be a problem. Great to watch on Ipad. Will use this again."
4,One of the best reality shows...,"This is well worth the money. This is one of the best reality shows on TV and is definitively the best of the ""Real Housewives"" franchises. It's a must have."
4,Flapper Party,"The episode was interesting because it showed what happened after the fight at Camille's. Kyle and Camille attempted to reconcile one more time. It looks like they made some progress. Watching reality shows can be a mirror into one's own life. I definitely can relate to situations, where their are women who have conflicts like this. Interestingly enough, they both seemed to make amends.I think it is possible to learn from the behavior of others, even though, most people would consider this tv show a fluff piece."
1,Thankyou,"Thank you to this show for making me happy being who I am. They think they are all good hearted empathetic, happy people but you can see how unhappy they are inside, and that money has made them soooooooooo spoiled.I'm really grateful for this show making me happy at my meagre salary and having to raise my own kids, not have 4 nannies - what a lunatic!"
1,TV Passholder should get instant access as soon as episode is posted!!!!,I am a Pass holder for this series.I should be given instant access when an episode is made available!!!!!!!Instead of waiting another couple hours!Ridiculous service! Get it together!
5,The BEST housewives!,"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills were my first ""housewives"" so I'm a late-comer to the Real Housewives franchise. As they were my first, I've come to love them the best, as I now watch ALL of the Housewives series. Season One of BH was Great. They're certianly entertaining. I watched the series when it aired and then watched it again on DVD. Check it out and you'll be hooked."
5,A great item at a great price!,Bought this for my wife's 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer and she really likes it. The cargo logic blocks work great for grocery shopping or anything else that you need to stop sliding around the liner. We have the third row seat and this can fold up when you use the third seat.
1,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO","Will never buy a wood meat tenderizing hammer again. If using to bang thin cuts, the spikes will get smashed dull quickly by the cutting board...and even splinter.Only used mine a few times, so it isn't useless (yet), but it definitely doesn't work as well and it looks like hell.Meat and fat also easily get stuck in the deep crevices (metal probably does this to a certain extent, too, but not as bad and, since it's not porous, the possibility of bacteria is much less)"
3,Made in China. Why?,"First off, I love OXO products. And this is a good one. Works like it should and is a good piece of wood. But it IS made in China. Couldn't they have made it using a company here? OXO needs to bring their jobs back to the USA. It's a freakin wooden meat tenderizer."
5,Incredibly Durable and Incredibly Comfortable,"I took these tights with me on a trip an wore them for five consecutive days, hand washing between wears of course, and they held their shape beautifully. No runs, not holes, no tears in the crotch area, even after five days, and they are genuinely reversible. I wore them with both black and brown side out. They are a tremendous space saver in a suitcase, and they hold up to being worn with tall boots. I snagged the leg in the zipper of one of my boots, and there was no damage, at all. Plus, they do hold you in nicely. The sizing can be a little vague. The fit is comparable to the SPANX Power Panty. If you own a pair of those, just buy the same size, and you should be fine."
4,Thanks Spanx,Thanks Spanx for a servicable and unique two-in-one product. Great for traveling because of the two different colors. Only wish that there was more tummy control.
3,SPANX reversible body-shaping tights- Waisteband does not stay smooth,"I ordered the SPANX reversible body-shaping tights in size C, color gray/black. The tights are constructed of stretch micro fiber, and advertise that the flat waistband is smooth and comfortable, won't dig. I find that the waistband flips in the front, and I am forced to readjust for maximum comfort. I do find that the tights provide full coverage and nicely shape the thighs and rear. I find that the Coolmax is successful and does wick sweat away from feet."
3,workit girlfriend.,"Must buy for the reservse make sure you handwash it bc,mines tore up after 2 wearing bc,I threw it washer by accident.it will last longer I promise if you hand wash it."
3,Unraveling a bit already!,"After wearing these tights the very first time, the crotch area started to unravel a bit. To avoid this, the tights need to be worn very snugly in the waist area. It was disappointing to see the unraveling ""runs"" in the seat area. The tights were not inexpensive!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"It seems like everyone is scared to say how bad this album is because they love Nelly. Nelly is good, Ali is bad, very bad. He is okay in the St. Lunatics buy cannot carry a song by himself, and this is terrible!"
2,"Album bad, with the exception of one song",The only good song on this album is Boughetto. It has a good beat with accompanying lyrics.
3,HIP HOP NOT CARTOON.....,"I only wish that people would take time and listen to the real hip hop. Yes I agree that MAINSTREAM HIP HOP may not be the best, but if people would take the time and listen to some underground groups like LivingLegends and Swollen Members. They would see that HIP HOP IS NOT A CARTOON just dumb people choose to say it is because they dont know what REAL HIP HOP is. I am an artist my self and I perform HIP HOP music and for someone to say that HIP HOP is a CARTOON is just plain ignorant, that would be like someone saying that alternative rock is a cartoon because a bad album came out or that pop was a joke because of the backstreet boys. All I am asking is for people to know the facts before they spew out nonsense.THANK YOU.....1"
4,Not Pac but better then others,This CD is not the best thing that I have ever heard but considering that Roy Jones is a boxer by trade I cant complain. This is a album that i am not ashamed to say that i own.
5,Sixty Forty,The cut i heard on the radio sixty forty was so dope i don't know what say. i am a big fan of roy's anyway so i'll buy it when it is available. Bernard who..........
3,Down goes Roy! Down goes Roy!,"I bought this cd because I've seen Roy in the ring and I thought if he brought the same intensity to his cd it would be great. While he does bring intensity, his rhyming skills are sub par. The beats to his songs are good, and he does have some nice rhymes but for the most part his flow is pretty mellow. In all reality, some of the things he says don't even rhyme! However, Roy does show potential but I just think he's to busy with boxing to care as much about the music. If you're a Roy Jones Jr. Fan buy this album. If you're a boxing(that's what the majority of these songs had to do with) fan or sports fan then by this album. However, if you're looking for an established star with good rhymes and flow look somewhere else because Roy at least with this cd doesn't deliver a knockout,HE GETS KNOCKED OUT!"
4,Roy Boy Holding His Own,"For all those who dismissed this album before hearing it just because he's a boxer and ""he must be bad at rapping if he's so good at fighting"", shame on you. Roy Jones Jr. is one of the most multi-talented entertainers ever. He's a solid rapper(grew up in Pensacola, FL freestyling against local rappers), he has been in three well-known movies, even though he was just doing cameos, and he's the greatest pound for pound boxer of all-time along with Floyd Mayweather. The lyrics might not be as brilliant as pac's or anything but they are typical rap lyrics that pump you up.P.S. From 1989 through 2003, Roy-Boy was 49-1(38 KOs) with his only loss coming in a DQ after he hit Montell Griffin while he was knocked down. He faced him 4 months later at the exact same weights and KOd him in two minutes.....what a god."
1,Stick with boxing,"I love to watch Roy Jones box, he is one of the most exciting boxers of today. Why tarnish your name with a stupid rap cd that has horrible lyrics, learn to write before you start rappin. The single I saw the video for was so poorly perfomed, his rhyme schemes are terrible and too simplistic. If you like most of the mainstreem rap thats out right now, which I dont, you might like this a little. Keep up the good work in the ring, I want to see that fight between you and Bernard."
2,Take it for what it is - Tall Tales from an ego maniac,"Yes, it's a fun read. Especially if, like Mitchell-Hedges, you're not overly concerned with truth or facts.A previous reviewer wrote:""Once in Central America Mike was able to discover one the most celebrated crystal skulls ever found. Although not known at the time, afterwards it has been discovered those crystal skulls are conscious depositories of knowledge, and wisdom.""Sorry, not true. While the Mitchell-Hedges Crystal Skull is a remarkable feat of artistry and engineering, it has never been submitted for a formal, scientific examination. In fact, his daughter has consistently refused to allow it to be examined. There are unsubstantiated reports that HP Labs did some testing on it in 1970, the reported tests did not uncover any mystical properties. That skull and all the other crystal skulls are nothing more than fakes created to bilk money from gullible people.Not unlike the ""tales of adventure"" told by Mitchell-Hedges."
1,it didn't work at all!!!!,"Everything plugged in fine, just didn't work. I bought it specifically to play Guitar Hero and no such luck."
2,Most Rea Fans Probably Won't Like This.,"I guess he got bored with the kind of music he'd been playing all his career. So here he takes a sharp turn towards techno, and if you're not already a fan of that style of music, I doubt if you'll find this very appealing. Having said that, I will admit that after 4-5 listens, a few songs did finally emerge from the muck and plant themselves in my brain. I'd initially planned on taking my copy down to the used record store and selling it, but on the strength of these few songs I decided to keep it after all. But if you're a fan of Chris Rea's music and you want more, I'd recommend any other album he has ever made over this one."
1,This CD takes its title literally,"I have been a Chris Rea fan since ""Benny Santini"" and own and love every CD since then. I anxiously awaited my copy of The Road to Hell II, and was terribley disappointed. In his effort to be different, I think Chris lost his way. I admire him for his effort, but hope that his next album will include more guitar, real drums, less repetition, and better lyrics."
3,Following Clapton's Lead,"First off original The Road To Hell is his best work and a 5 star album. If your looking to discover Rea then start there. But then again if you liked Eric Clapton's Pilgrim album and ""I Get Lost"" song this might be your cup of tea. Though unlike Clapton - Rea is not playing as much guitar on this one, which is a shame.But chances are those reading these reviews are Rea fans. And to those I bring up the lack of guitar on this album. His voice is in top form, but it could've been a lot better with more guitar.The last half of the album is superior to the first half. Die hards will be pleased with ""Marvin"" ""New Times Square"" and ""Firefly"".I was bored with God's Great Banana Skin and Blue Cafe. He was treading old ground over and over. So this make him a little more interesting."
1,Downward spiral,"Compared with Rea classics like ""On the beach"" or ""Auberge"", this cd doesn't even deserve a single star. For me, this record is just the sad climax of an artistical crisis that started out with ""Espresso logic"" in 1993. On his new album Rea incorporates techno and house beats, but he fails terribly. I'm a fan of contemporary electronic music, but what Rea does is pure claptrap. Monotonously stomping beats are no substitute for good song ideas and melodies! This album was a bad flop in Germany and doesn't contain a single decent song. And the cover artwork which shows a man captive in a computer monitor is just too trite to believe! I hope Rea will find back to his old style. By the way, ""Road to hell part 1"" is probably Rea's most interesting and ambitious album."
1,Huh?! What happened?,"What happened here? Is this seriously Chris Rea?That's what pops into my head when I start trying to listen to this so-called successor to ""The Road to hell"".I'm rather disgusted by this entire affair.Somebody tried to pull a Clapton/Simon Climie ala ""Pilgrim""It's my least favorite Chris Rea release. In my humble opinion his worst release. It's a rather annoying release and almost unlistenable. I was highly disappointed by this. My least played Rea album and one that now simply sits in my collection."
2,A Major Disappointment.,"Compared to the original ""Road to Hell"" album, this is a very poor effort. Chris Rea has deliberately tried to make the songs sound more up to date - In other words, there's a lot of drum machines and some female backing vocals. Quite frankly it just doesn't work.Lyrically, there's nothing very new either. The lyrics continue the same theme as the original album, with just a bit of a NY theme thrown in. Even worse, the song ""Good Morning"" sounds just like a filler designed to add another 5 minutes of playing time to the CD.Two songs do stand out from the general mediocrity here. ""E"" is a well presented and thoughtful song about the drug Ecstacy, and the ballad ""Marvin"" a touching tribute to Marvin Gaye. Interestingly, both these songs sound more like traditional Chris Rea.In short, this artist is capable of much better work than this. Give this one a miss."
3,Either the Dash is a Battery Drainer or needs a Stronger Battery,"This battery seems to work as well as my original battery worked when it was new. The Dash seems to drain batteries rather quickly. Leave a couple applications open, and battery drains fast. I do not spend too much time talking on the phone, and get maybe 2 hours of actual talk time."
1,Doesnt work with HTC 3G Dash like the title says,The product I received didnt work with the HTC 3G Dash like it says in the title. Wasted time and money
1,"Battery ""bubbled"" after less than 6 months","After less than 6 months of using this battery, it has ""bubbled"". The chemicals inside have expanded and so the once-flat sides are now pushed out and rounded (kinda like those bad laptop batteries you keep hearing about). It hasn't ever been in extremely hot or cold temperatures (it never gets left in the car or outside). So because of this, the back won't even fit on my Dash correctly anymore. Also, the battery life is down to maybe 12 hours (making maybe 1 or 2 phone calls during that time), probably a side effect of the battery bubbling. I would not recommend buying this battery as a replacement."
5,Best replacement! So happy with this product!,"I can't express how much this product has helped me. The battery that came with my Dash was ok in the beginning, but quickly deteriorated. The new battery arrived promptly and keeps my phone (which i use very heavily) charged all day and it still has 2 or 3 bars at the end of the day! I love it and would highly recommend it!"
5,satisfied,Bought this a few weeks ago. It took exactly as long as they said... like 5 days. Works great! I would recomend this item for DASH T mobile. My original battery only lasted less then a year.
3,"Good price, different specs",I was glad to find a replacement battery that didn't cost a fortune. So far it works good. Will last a day with moderate talk. Only complaint is it is different specs than the OEM. OEM is 3.7v and 960mAh. The new on eis 37v 1050mAh. I think this means it should last longer but seems to be the same or a little less.
3,Entertaining but how true?,"Bought this book beacuse it seemed interesting and it has since inspired some good conversations. BUT and its a big one, the list seem to hold little merit and often make little sense. A list on one page about Libraries that are largest(public or private? didnt specify) didnt match up with the list on the following page about Private libraries that were largest even though there was over lap. I was disappointed and as i went along i felt like some of the lists were fabricated at best."
4,Wonderful Resource!,"In reading a Path to Follow, I found it to be a fantastic resource for thinking about how to involve ALL parents in the education of their children. By highlighting the idea that parents and teachers can have honest and mutually beneficial conversations about children, I think that the authors of this book have hit on the true meaning of parent involvement!"
5,works really well,It is really nice to have a good portable battery for my printer again. Received this in a short amount of time and it works great
5,Battery pac for H470 printer,"Purchased this battery aprox 1 mo. ago. Charged overnight and then plugged in to my printer as per instructions. (Nice to have one less cord to carry around). HP claims up to 450 pages on one charge. I don't know how many pages it will actually print but so far it has done 125 pages without a problem also, many of the pages were in color. The charge has lasted for a month so far and is still going strong. I'm very happy with this battery. 5 stars."
5,You are my world,"We really like to listen to this album in the car. Our children love to here #'s 1,2,8, and 13 over and over again. And we don't mind. We cannot wait to buy more Hillsong music. I like the whole album myself. EVERY SONG."
1,Bad movie - Oh God protect us.,"Some movies are so bad that it is hard to put into words. You wonder how anyone could take part in the movie or allow it to be made. How could they release something like this. The story, well there is no story. The acting is bad, well there was no acting. If God loved us he would protect us from something like this. If there is a God I would hate to have anything to do with this movie and have to face him. I saw some good reviews of this movie here on Amazon.Com. I saw two people gave it 5 stars. I understand that people like different things but my God. I suspect that there are people out there will like any film that puts forward faith in God. If you believe in paying for your sins before you face God, if you think suffering will ease your way into heaven then watch this movie. There are a lot of great films about God, faith and religion out there please do not put yourself thur hell by watching this one. God have mercy on us."
4,what a surprise!! It wasn't cheesy!!,"Was really expecting something more along the cheesiness B movie line like Left Behind or something. I wasn't to thrilled with Left Behind, I enjoyed the books much more. I thought they could have done more with that movie, but this movie, Judgement, I actually enjoyed it. There were a few violent scenes, but not anything full of gore. Just boom and they're dead, one explosion. No foul language. My copy said it wasn't rated, but Amazon.com labels this movie as PG-13, which I thought was appropriate. It's not something I'd want my 2 year old watching, but wouldn't be horrified if he woke up from a nap and saw a scene or two.I'd recommend this movie. This was apparently a sequel. I didn't know it when I bought it and followed along fine without seeing the first movie."
5,enthralling,"This is the fourth film in the Apocalypse triology. Helen Hannah was saved from execution by the antichrist himself so he could humiliate her and show the world what happends to those who follow God. Meanwhile, the underground band of haters plans an escape. Helen's lawyer struggles with what is happening. We learn that his mark is fake. He doesn't believe in Jesus or Maclausso as messiah, he just believes in earth. Tangiable things. Will Helen escape? Will her lawyer come to Jesus or accept the mark of the beast?"
3,The Best in the Series,With the exception of suffering through Mr. T trying to read lines this movie is wonderful and quite compelling and powerful. The courtroom scenes are great and this film really pulls you in. I enjoyed this film and Tribulation the best. Can't wait to see what else they come up with. Cloud Ten is a studio that has done some really great stuff and some real bad stuff too. But that's creativity for you.
1,Poor Quality Finish,"The stainless steel and the polished brass are fine and dandy, but the painted Franklin bathroom support bars have a poor quality finish that cannot endure the rigors of the shower and Pennsylvania's acid water..The stainless steel support bar is much the better, but the white ones painted finish does not hold up. After six months the paint was cracked, and rust made its appearance.Thus the replacement is now stainless steel.On the instructions(and they must only be in English), the following should be stated : The painted support bars are not recommended for use in damp areas, please use the brass or stainless steel only.Another thing I detest about today's products is the triple languaging used on the details and instructions. Here in America we use and speak one language - English."
1,valchrispt,"The CD player on this product lasted 3 months and has not played another one since. It just played one day, and then did not the next."
2,sound not good,"sound is disappointing, sounds coppery and undeveloped, i would be happy if it wasnt so expensive - i would price it at $15 tops, plus it doesnt have a mp3 input/ av cable input which everthing should be equipped with the ipod age"
2,Poor Quality FM Tuner,"We have owned this exact Philips clock radio for 3 years. The product is cheaply designed, or uses inferior components. Out of frustration we are now looking for a replacement because the radio cannot stay tuned to the major radio stations in Los Angeles. Given the unstable fidelity of the FM reception, I don't believe there's a good value here.I will concede that the introduction of ""HD Radio"" in Los Angeles may play a role in the poor sound. Once the major stations converted to HD, the unit's sound quality deteriorated. I switched from one station to another, then the 2nd station converted to HD in January '08.Sadly, my CDs have always sounded terrible on this product."
3,ONE MAJOR FLAW,"This unit and it's successor the AJ3910/37B both suffer from the same fatal flaw: although the packaging states in large bold lettering: ""Wake to your favorite CD track,"" there is no way to set a track number for the alarm. The unit's alarm will ONLY wake you with the first track of the CD. I called Philips support (which was quite helpful), and they confirmed this. They also confirmed that Philips does not make a comperable product with said feature.It's a shame really because everything else about the unit is top notch. The clock read-out is clear and bright enough to read across the room without my glasses on, yet not so bright as to disturb my sleep. The sound is top notch for such a small unit, and the controls are pretty easy to use.But the lack of ability to select a specific track to wake up to is a fatal flaw. When faced with the decision to either: (a.) burn a pile of custom CDs, or (b.) exchange the unit for one with the all-important feature, I'd rather exchange the unit."
4,Very nice,"This is a pretty good only a couple of small complaints.1. the numbers are very bright so at times I have to put a barrier up so it doesn't disturb me. My husband likes that the numbers are larger than my previous one so he can see them when he's getting dressed since his doesn't have illuminated numbers.2. CD/Alarm - I can't fall asleep to a CD if I don't want to be awakend by a CD. You can only select Radio/CD/Alarm.The ""sleep"" time between alarms is 6 minutes, which I find odd, but that's fine. Love the 2 alarm settings...one for weekday and one if I need it on the weekends."
3,Compact but not a good radio signal,"I purchased this radio to save space. It is small, but I am not happy with the radio signal. The CD player does not have a button to select a track either, which makes me have to listen to all tracks in order prior to the one I want to get to."
2,Is there a cd-radio worth the bucks ($),"Purchased this as a replacement for the RCA RP5640 - CD clock radio which lasted all of 12 days. While the Philips cost ~40% less, it didn't impress on the large points (not feeling ""cheap"" and not auto-setting the current time) and the small (didn't include the backup battery). Other small points: (1.) The clock face doesn't appear to have a dimmer switch, and in order to play a CD you've got to have a red ""cylon eye"" glowing as well. (2.) The mechanism of the cd player can be heard from 2 feet away (a ""whirring"").If it lasts, I may recall that ~$40 USD was a decent price. Right now, I'm thinking not-so-much."
2,too much static,"I think this clock radio is adorable, a nice little package, but I'm returning mine because the radio reception is so weak that the static is really bothersome. Admittedly I live in an area (NYC) where it's hard to get a strong clear radio signal, but I just bought a no-name replacement from RadioShack that's giving me reception without the static, so there it is. If you live in an area with good reception, this is probably not such an issue."
2,Very Bright Display - CD Player acting up after 6 months,"After 6 months I have deleted my original review... My main beef with this product is that I had to put a pillow in front of the clock to avoid the harshly bright dislpay...it's way too bright in a dark room when you are trying to sleep. More recently (after 6 months), the CD player has taken to stopping in the middle of a CD. The lens over the laser/detector looks clean as a whistle, so I don't have a clue what's broken.I would not recommend this product, in fact I purchased a new alarm clock that projects the time onto the ceiling because the overly bright AJ3910 was too much work to deal with at night. I Highly recommend getting a clock radio with a dimmer function. I also noticed that it appears this is no longer available directly from Amazon..."
1,Didn't keep time,"First, this Clock radio is compact and looks great, but the problem I had is that it didn't keep the correct time. Within an hour, it would be two minutes behind. Within eight hours, it would be 15 minutes slow. The front button features worked out well for me. Other than not keeping time, I would have kept this item."
1,CD player broke after 4 months,"My husband and I bought this for our infant's room to play soothing CDs when she was upset. We used it everyday for about 2 months and then only used it about once every other week. We tried to turn it on tonight when our daughter was fussy and the CD player won't read any CD. The radio has a weak reception, so now it is just an expensive, bulky clock. And since it is past 30 days we can't return it. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Trash,"I bought two of these, and neither CD player worked for long. I bought them 4 years ago, so maybe they fixed the problem - but I doubt it, as I see the other reviews. I'm shocked they are still being sold!"
1,"Bad customer service, Bad radio reception, Package smells weird","My purpose of purchasing this cd clock radio is to listen radio and cd. First when i received this package smells super weird like got it from homeless. Then I tried to listen am 1400/1450 snd some fm channels. all i heard was cccczzzzzzzzzz instead. so i wrote to let ""c_amazon-deals"" the partner store know that this product was not working. They told me to send the item back to them and could get full refund but shipping fee were nonrefundable. I do not want to keep this crappy thing in my room. So i sent the item back to them and had to paid return shipping fee from my own pocket which is around $12 eventhough the radio is not working. After they got my returned radio and tried to charged me 4 dollors more saying for the extra shipping fee they paid. I felt myself got trick by this marketplace seller. Stay Away from this marketplace seller."
3,Nothing incredible here.....(spoilers ahead),"While I love the illustrations from Lee Weeks & Jae Lee, the story itself gets a bit confusing especially if you've been out of the loop w/ the Hulk comics. I was a big fan of Peter David's now classic run on The Incredible Hulk but ""Tempest Fugit"" crosses between flashbacks & cliche cameos by Wolverine, Kang, Fing Fang Foom, Leonard Samson, etc. but even more predictable is that their in actuality just conjurer's to confuse the Hulk some more. This almost reads like an episode of Lost & ironically enough, Peter David does poke fun at that show w/ a remark that Banner makes when addressing Kang who's actually the villain Nightmare. The last part of the book is very short & just comes across as standard filler material despite Jae Lee's awesome artwork. Nothing terribly great going on in these pages."
2,Moderately useful information but extremely idealistic...,"Some of the information provided in this book is helpful and even useful but most of this is just too idealistic and not very practical in the actual operation of a ""real"" day care business. Perhaps more of the suggestions would work in a Home Day Care, but they really are not very practical in a medium to large corporate operation, even one like ours that is privately owned (not a franchise)."
4,Admirably relates the heroic tale of The Calgary Highlanders,"Basing his past-paced narrative on primary sources, Bercuson unveils a gripping drama of a peaceful Canadian militia regiment suddenly thrust into the maelstrom of World War II. Although written from the battalion and company commander perspective, he skillfully interweaves personal deeds of heroism, brutal scenes of horror and acts of devotion throughout this highly readable story. Full of suspense and pathos, his exciting battle descriptions leave the reader emotionally exhausted. The only major drawback to Bercuson's book is its lack of adequate topographic maps. After all, a soldier without a map is like a surgeon without a scapel. Many valuable lessons of leadership, lovalty and unit cohesion may be learned from this regimental history. However, its main lesson is the awful reconfirmation that the price of freedom is paid by the blood of our youth. The Highlanders suffered 403 dead and 1354 wounded during the war."
2,Not Up to Current Standards,"In no way does this book compare to Black Yesterdays, South Albertas at War, or even Bloody Buron. A lack of significant maps, photos, and appendices render the book impotent in its descpriptions of the battalion at war. Fatal casualty list in the back is incomplete and strewn with errors. Photo section is poorly thought out.The book is far more readable than most regimental histories, and far better than Farran's history. Bercuson looks unflinchingly at the CO's failings, for example. But compared to the new state-of-the-art in regimental histories cited above, the book falls well short of the mark."
3,An Extended Player's Manual for Counter-Strike (Xbox),"Prima's official strategy guide for the Xbox version of Counter-Strike is little more than a beginner's guide, but it's a thorough one. The beginning section of the guide is an in-depth explanation of the mechanics of the game for newbies with a few useful tips sprinkled throughout. The next part is the most interesting one - the weapons chart which shows you all the statistics for the weapon as well as the weapon's damage effect on an oppponent either with kevlar and helmet protection or without. The rest of the guide goes on to detail the individual maps of the game with overall strategies to detailed tactics. Overall, if you're already a mediocre CS player, you don't need this, but if you're new to CS, I'd consider purchasing it."
2,Cool...But It's Not What I Ordered,"I oredered this guide thinking that it covered the original Counter Strike for XBox. Well, I was wrong. I was instead sent the guide for the game Sounter Strike: Condition Zero, which has the same maps as Counter Strike, but it's not what i ordered."
3,Get Ready To Talk..........blah blah blah,"Well this game wasn't that good. But the story lines was ok and the back grounds were nice. But it needs some action, if u love fighting then don't buy this game but if u like to talk... get it."
5,Great season of a great show.,"This is one of my favorite shows on television now. Smart, fashionable, dramatic, and funny - it has everything I enjoy watching. This was a great season, full of drama and surprises. I recommend it to any fan of the show...and I recommend the show itself to anyone. I've introduced so many different kinds of people to the show, and everyone loves it."
5,S-BETT-tacular!,Ugly Betty is an overall hysterical show that keeps you amused from cute peep-toe shoe to Vanessa William's raised brow of doom! Each character is played brilliantly through each season! Nonstop laughter! Let the comedy ensue!
5,Ugly betty fan,"If you love ugly betty, you'll love owning and watching it on dvd. Especially those of you who are just as sad as I am about the ending of the series and kinda excited, but nervous at how badly they will mess up the possible movie in the works!"
4,very perceptive,"This book was very interesting. It presented a unique view of the way rugby shaped South African society and influenced the way whites percieved themselves. It also includes a scholarly discussion oof the ways in which rugby influenced apartheid. This book is very different, and quite mind-expanding."
4,review,Took a punt at reading a new novel and was pleasantly suprised.A good crime story told just the right way.
4,A great second book in this series,"I don't recall how I became aware of this series of books by J.A. Konrath, but I just finished reading BLOODY MARY and enjoyed it immensely. I read his first book, WHISKEY SOUR awhile ago and interested me enough to continue onto this second book.BLOODY MARY continues with the characters from the first book, and brings them alive with witty dialogue and outrageous situations. Some sequences might be a bit graphic but that's just fuel from my mind's eye. I feel for Jacqueline Daniels and the others in her life. Mr. Friskers is a hoot.J.A. Konrath writes with humor and attitude. I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the rest in this series. Move over, Janet Evanovich."
2,I Passed on this one,Have enjoyed the previous books. This one was just too much blood and gore. It seems like every mystery author tries to out do the blood and gore aspect.The authors have very little knowledge of what real crime is. Hope this is toned down in the books to come.
2,"Not my cup of tea, I guess.","It might be just me, but I couldn't get ""into"" this book. I prefer Jeffery Deaver or Ken Follett for mystery/suspense type books."
4,Another good one!,"Loved this book as well. This was the 3rd in the series, Can't wait to read the next one. Another one I just couldn't put down."
4,"Good book of the series,but...","This is the tamer of the books J.A. Konrath has written. The others are far to bloody for my taste, and have given them away without reading most.This book has some tameness to it, and I would recommend it to others, but would tell them the other books are very harsh. Well it's up to the readers if they like or idslike that type of writing."
2,"Why not call it ""Whiskey Sour Once Again""?","Bloody Mary is a very poor sequel to Whiskey Sour. It is the same book, basically. Once again, a powerful sociopath has a personal vendetta against Jack. I hope the author has something new to offer in the upcoming third book in the series...Unbelieveably, according to the reviews of Rusty Nail, the 3rd book, he recycled the story again. Forget it!"
3,Bloody it is.,I found this book lacking in the plot. When they are at trail did no one in the courtroom catch that fuller admitted to it. That kind of surprised me. Other than that the book was great. The sense of humor was stellar
5,Loved it!,This was a very good story. I will have to check out more of the Jack Daniels Mystery books.Humorous in many spots while remaining a mystery.Thank you!
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Lately, I have been attracted to a whole new genre of books. I picked up ""Whiskey Sour"" on a fluke, and upon finishing it, I immediately put ""Bloody Mary"" on my TBR list. Jack Daniels is a likeable character, with her faults and unique personality traits, and Konrath's ability to develop her to the point of jumping off the pages makes it all the better. With great dialogue, rockin' plots, and outstanding writing, the Jack Daniels series may be among this decades best of its kind.Konrath keeps it fast and sharp, like these type of books should. He doesn't drag the reader down into a pit of extra words and fluffy descriptions. ""Bloody Mary"" is a ""knock em dead"" book that gets my two thumbs up and a snap!"
5,Mystery Killer,"Jack is a cop with a great partner. They work on solving the mystery of who is killing people and leaving body parts in a morgue. Finding out it was another cop in their precinct, puts a twist on their search."
4,Bloody Mary - A Thriller,I really liked the story but the ending was too abrupt. It left me wondering if she got back with Latham and if her mother ever came out of her comma.
1,Disappointed,I tried this book for the first time and used recipe for Summer Zucchini bread on page 90. It was a disaster. I felt there is an error in this one because it only called for 1/3 cup of water for large loaf of bread! I followed this one to the letter and the result was a hard clumpy mess. I'm an experienced bread maker user and this was a huge disappoint.
1,Not impressed,Have purchased quite a few bread machine books and this is my least favorite. Tried numerous recipe's that failed to live up.
4,Excellent book for the health conscious!,"My family is very happy with this book. It has healthy, great tasting recipes without added fat or sugar that are easily made in the bread maker. Definitely recommended."
5,This is a great book for motivation,I think this book is one of the best motivational books I have ever read. Anytime I am feeling down or stressed I can look at this book for a few minutes and I feel like I can go out and conquer the world. I am often wondering what is the true meaning of life and this book helps answer that question. I highly recomend this book for anyone who enjoys uplifting life quotes or self-help books.
2,Very dull,"The only reason I would recommend getting this book is to fill the gap in your Choose your own adventure collection. R.A. Montgomery is real notorious on vagueness when it comes to his storytelling. He'll be real in depth with the plot on one hand and then fast forward with generalizations on the other. I also don't understand why he keeps recycling names of planets and galaxies from his other works like 'Space and Beyond'. I was able to beat the book on my first read. All I really had to do was not be reckless and make 'safe bet' decisions, more specifically: always consult with congress. In the end, it seemed that destroying the 'Power Master's' fleet of minions and breaking through his forcefield was a piece of cake in all of a half a page. I suppose it's all just campy, innocent, 80's sci-fi complete with futuristic 'printouts' of data."
3,book review,"I read War with the Evil Power Master. There were many different stories with many different endings. I read all the stories, some of witch I died in and others I was a hero. I would recommend this book if you like sifi fantasy adventures. So if you like stuff like that, go get this book!"
3,Not Bad,This album wasn't bad. The best song is Little Things of Venom..I first heard the song while in Las Vegas. The lead singer appears as the lead character in an IMAX film called Haunted House which is shown at the Luxor Hotel & Casino. The band appears together at the end singing the Venom song which is played throughout.
5,before anything else,"What can I say, They supported the counting crows in glasgow @ the start of 2000. I was far more impressed by them than the crows, Upstaged was not the word, ive spent since then trying to find the album in scotland to no avale. Thus why im here, arid are by far the most promising band ive heard in a while,Personnal I think comparing them to jeff buckley is not fitting and draws a poor conclusion to those who like myself are not a big jeff buckley fan.What can I say but stress beyond any shadow of a doubt BUY THIS ALBUM. invest in arid. For those who are still not convinced cause im only hear buying the cd, consider this Its on the strenght of a half hour set..."
5,Music That Calls My Heart Home,"The walls of my life close in every day, but then I hear his voice breaking through the other side. And his heart and soul reaches out to me, pulling me deep into sound, and instrumental waves slam into brick stones. And the heart of lyrics roars with soul, and I am his until the music comes to an end."
5,Let go and begin again,"This book of meditations was on my daily list of readings when my husband of 51 years passed away.I had been reading the book before he died but after his death the readings became more poignant.The meditations help pick yourself up, emotionally, physically and spiritually. We are not alone, there are many of us (the whole human race) going through different struggles daily.Many times we are our own worst enemies and many of us think that we are alone. The author makes us understand that we are not alone and if we are willing to pick up our mat and walk, only then we will be able to face our situation(s) and move on.Like the Byrds share with us in their song: Turn, Turn, Turn. There is a season for everything under the sun.The Byrds - Turn Turn Turn: A Musical Documentary"
1,BAD SERVICE,I never recieved my book. I pay for nothing. I am still waiting for it. I never going to buy from this seller again...I really wanted to read this book.
