5,I'm loving it,Awsome movie one of the best movies of the 70's crime drama comedy has it all took A while to come out on dvd don't know why Great cast great acting
5,The Brinks job,very good and the price was right and it was fast dellivery service ouiltey of vhs tape was very good and look brand new.
2,A better recording exists!,"Stanford's Second Piano Concerto is far better than his first effort in this genre, and he admits that he was inspired to write it after hearing Rachmaninoff's Second Concerto, which becomes clear to the listener. However, Stanford's Second abounds with original and beautiful tunes, is well-orchestrated and quite engaging, even on the first hearing. The Fingerhut performance has been available on CD for sometime now, so I was interested in hearing this latest entry into the catalogue.Sadly, this recording lands short of ideal. The pianist seems to have his part well in hand, but the instrument he plays has a thin and brittle sound. The orchestra plays badly, well below most acceptable standards. In short, stick to the Fingerhut performance, which includes another Stanford work for piano and orchestra: Variations on ""Down Among the Dead Men."" Don't be turned off by the gruesome title; it is a fine set of variations, if a bit long."
4,Scared the bejeesus outa me!,"I rented this film to watch at my boyfriend's apartment one night when he was out of town. When it was over, I couldn't decide if it would be scarier to stay there alone or walk the block to my own home.This is one film that proves that big computer animated ghosties do not a scary movie make. The scariest things in this movie are a piano with a note that won't play, and a ball that just won't go away. No creeping black goo. No screaming cherub statues. No oozing smoke morphing into monsters. You all can keep your remakes of ""The Haunting"", I'll take ""The Changling"" any day as an example of truly frightening entertainment."
5,SPINE CHILLING!,I Hired this thinking it would be another old dodgy film. It absolutely scared me senseless! I love the atmosphere and especially the sceen with the psychic writing the messages down on paper (automatic writing). This is the BEST haunted house film ever made. You WILL be scared if you watch this. WARING! It will give you the creeps...
4,Genuinely chilling,"If you like intelligent, low-key, well-crafted horror films such as The Others or the original version of The Haunting, you'll probably like The Changeling. The script isn't the greatest, but director Peter Medak really has a feel for creating a spectral atmosphere. Features the best seance scene since the one in Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon."
3,Great Scott!,"I have never seen a ghost story like this one and it kept me glued to my seat! George C. Scott did a wonderful job in this film and it's infortunate that he has left us. This story is about a man's love of music(a composer)and he seeks comfort in it after his wife and child were killed tragically by a truck. He decides to seek a new home to find solace and work on his music writing. While he is settling in his new 'mansion'and working round the clock, he discovers he's not alone. Need I say more.....The connection between a broken-hearted father and the ghost of a lost child clash in a very deadly twist of fate. I suggest you see it and I am glad that I became a fan of George C. Scott."
5,Surprisingly Frightening Old-Fashioned Ghost Story,"This made-for-TV movie is surprisingly strong, probably one of the best of the genre. The ghost bits are very psychological - it's not what you see, but what you expect to see! If you like the Haunting or the Innocents (or, in another way, Alien or The Thing), add this one to your collection.Starring George C. Scott, the film is set in a wonderfully huge and ornamented old house, complete with strange banging noises, a secret room, scary seance session and mysterious recordings of a child's voice found on a tape. Who was he?! Watch this one in the dark with somebody near."
5,great movie..great dvd,finally someone has did justice to a old movie to dvd..sound and picture are very good. video is darker than normal and looks like most movies do when in the theater. they did a great job on sound..for example when the seance is being played on his recorder it really gives you a sound like you are there in the house with him..and rest of movie the surround works good..so if you have a theater sound system be prepared to enjoy..grab your popcorn...turn out the lights and sit back and enjoy....
5,browser,"you will never walk by a set of stairs without being scared again....the wheelchair! I first saw this movie when I was about 4 years old and i have seen it hundreds of times since. By far, the scariest movie experience ever!"
5,Now THIS is Horror,"What a classic. One of the (if not the) best horror movie I've ever seen. This is a movie that will leave you with vivid scenes and nightmares, unlike these new hokie Hollywood films with teeny-boppers running around with 4-foot knives, chopping each other up. In case Hollywood hasn't realized, that stuff isn't scary, just stupid. What's scary is psychological horror like this movie, which actually makes you use your head. The seance scene (all of it) and when the little girl sees the boy coming through the floor of her room still sticks in my head to this day. I could watch this flick 1000 more times and only get more out of it each time. If you like horror that's actually disturbing, not just random slaughtering, and that really stays with you, this is one of the best."
5,Never Forgotten,"After a few decades of watching horror (from blood bath to terror to shiny shocker) no film of this genre has ever affected quite like this one did. With writing, direction and acting all in a perfect row a classic was made; The Changeling should easily fall within any discerning fan's top 10 list."
4,still a good movie,"It was almost as good as I remembered, but it was a tad slow and it could have had more scary/ghost parts. This might be a good one to remake, not with a bunch of graphic ghoul but a little more high tech and more scary/ghost parts. It's a good solid scary story."
5,This one will SCARE YOU!,"I remember how this movie made both my date and I jump when seeing it when it came out in 79, and it still has the same affect today. It doesn't rely on huge special effects like todays movie do, instead it goes for the ""made you jump"" tacktick of realy scary moments that make you think twice.(the bouncing ball down the stairs is one of the scariest moments I've ever seen on film) I've seen and own a huge number of horror/scary films over the years, and this one is still one of my top 3. See it. I know you won't be dissapointed.."
5,Great Classic Horror Film,"Other than ""Nosferatu"" and a handful of other movies, The Changeling could be ranked as the best horror film of all time.It is truly a great movie. I'm not a George C Scott fan, but he was great in ""Patton"" and acceptable in ""The Changeling.""I will not spoil any of the film, but he is not the right actor for the first half of the film, but finishes strong in the second half. I'm sure there was more to the special effects than what there appears to be, but it really doesn't have the special effects that you see in today's movies....and it doesn't need them....the filmmakers knew what they were doing. They learned what most haven't, you don't always have to see it to be scared of it. Have fun with this one and buy it now."
4,Made me jump! That Kind of Scary!!!,One of the first movies to actually make me Jump! I rented this movie years ago and will never forget it. There is this weird fear of old rickety wheelchairs that scares the pants off of me. Just seeing the cover of this movie scared me. You will realize that a wheelchair can scare you like that. A child's rubber ball...harmless??? Yeah right. Watch this movie and see if you don't freak out over a rubber ball. I really loved this movie. After buying it on DVD I again was as scared and freak-out just the same as I was the first time I saw it years ago. The sound and picture are pretty good and nothing to complain about. Enjoy this movie with a person that likes to cling to your arm during movies. They'll never let go and you might have to ask them to release a little pressure from your arm occasionally. G.
4,An Eerie Ghost Story That Is More Than Just Ghosts...,"After an accident where John Russell (George C. Scott) losses his wife and daughter he tries to rebound by taking a teaching job. In the city where he is teaching, he rents an enormous house where odd things begin to happen. He wakes up to banging sounds and doors are opening without the use of the human hand. The mysterious happenings begin to escalate and it is becoming intensely alarming. John tries to understand what is going on, but is it too late for him to decipher the occurrences? The Changeling is horror story that builds up a frightening atmosphere that keeps the audience on their toes from the beginning to the end as they can feel the chilly draft blow across their neck."
4,obvious problems?,"I'd like to correct the misinterpretation by 'Ishmael166@AOL.com' down below. He claimed the film has 'holes in the story'. No offence, but he mixed up two families who lived in the same house but the different period. 'C.S.B.' stands for Cola Stella Barnard who was 'killed by a coal cart' in 1909. 'Four family gravestones in the cemetary' are belong to the Barnard family who lived in the house around that time. Before that, the Carmichael family lived in the house and the boy was murdered then. 'They' left for Europe in 1906. So, there are no 'holes' that he pointed out."
4,Atmospheric Thriller,"Although it occasionally degenerates into silliness, The Changeling is by and large the most effective haunted-house thriller since the original ""The Haunting."" Played with considerable restraint by the cast and directed in a clean, uncluttered fashion, it should easily satisfy any one who wants ghostly chills rather than cheap slasher effects."
5,Prepare to be scared......,"Released in 1979, The Changeling is a masterful film filled with suspense and terrifying moments. The late George C Scott is superb as John Russell, a composer who moves into an old mansion after the tragic deaths of his wife and daughter. There strange happenings occur and he soon realises that something in the house is trying to comunicate with him!Scott is supported well by Trish Van Devere as the local historian who helped him to find a house and together they finally get to the bottom of what is causing the events to happen.One of my all time favourite films it still gives me the creeps to this day, especially the playback of the seance and the 'ball' sequence. Definately worth having in your collection!"
4,A classic,"I bought The Changeling because of all the great reviews that it received. The movie certainly does deliver suspense and fright as it was intended to do through a great plot. However, like me, most of you who choose to watch this movie must already be a fan of ghost/haunted house movies, and will find that you have already seen many of the elements present in this movie in other more recent movies. I would have enjoyed this movie alot more had i seen it before the other movies. The Changeling definitely is a classic and a must see for the true fans of haunted house movies."
4,"spooky, but not as great as the reviews","this movie does have some spooky moments, the best being when the wheelchair gets a life of its own and chases the woman down the stairs, very scary, but other than that I was not terrified. The story line is good but I did not like the fact that Scotts character was showing interest in another woman not long after his wife and daughter were killed. That turned me off and soured the whole movie."
4,The Changeling 1980,"They say it's loosely based on a true story, since we were not there we would have to take their word for it, but yes there is such a thing as creepy scary even downright haunted houses. This Movie is Good,Part-Horror,More Dramatic,more whodunit,more of a Thriller really. But it's a good movie to watch."
4,Scary movie without gore,"Very good ghost story. Heartbreaking in one scene but aside from that, entertaining movie, good cast."
5,A Classic,"Simply one of the best ghost stories on film. George C. Scott is the thinking person's hero who tries to get to the bottom of a mystery that occured years ago in the house he is renting as he wrestles with the grief of the recent loss of his family. If you have never seen this film, you owe it to yourself to check it out. This is how we made films before CGI, when acting was the hallmark of a good picture."
3,Not my kind of movie,"I don't like horror movies. I bought this for my dad. He enjoyed it, so that's all that matters."
2,Irritating premise,"This movie tries to be moralistic... but the message in this movie was ridiculous. The politician who was adopted to replace the murdered boy is made out to be a villain. How in the world would an orphaned six-year-old child be to blame for accepting the family that adopted him? The conclusion is supposed to represent some form of justice againt the politician, even though both the politician and the ghost were victims. Absurdly moralistic and overrated."
5,One of the true great ghost stories,"When I first saw this movie, I was alone and it scared me as well as kept me enthralled with the story. I have since seen it a few more times. And yes, it still gives me chills, even describing it to others gives me goose bumps. When I hear people talking about scary movies, I always, always recommend they watch this. The main reason I find it so terrifying...it could happen to you."
3,Pretty Good Old-School Psychological Horror Flick,"If you're expecting a shocking gross-out fest, you might as well stop reading now. However, if you're interested in a film along the lines of ""The Uninvited"", this is a good bet. George C. Scott is a widower who moves into an apparently haunted house, and becomes the instrument of a Ghost's revenge. The film is very slowly and deliberately paced, and the revelations come slowly, so patience is a must. Overall, it is a film worth watching for Horror fans. The DVD is pretty much extra-free; Just Cast & Crew Bios."
4,Good Movie with Atmosphere,"I tried watching this 4 of 5 times and each time I fell asleep. It has a sleep inducing quality to it. Usually movies that put you to sleep aren't good. I finally forced myself to stay awake through the whole thing and it was really good.It's about a guy who loses his wife and daughter then moves into this house that is haunted by the spirit of a boy from 1900. From there on it gets creepier as the boy is trying to communicate with him from the dead and reveal the horrific stuff that happened to him so the guy could solve the case... The seance scene was so creepy.It's got that old school quality to it and real atmosphere/genuine creepiness you don't find in the movies of today. Overall, i'd say it's a solidly good movie and i'd recommend any horror fan or fan of scary movies to buy it.Good story, good atmosphere, how a real horror should be done."
4,George C Scott classic,"This DVD with Mr Scott and an enthralling plot is excellent ""depth psychology"" for understanding human development."
4,Classic acting,I was engrossed in the Changeling. The musical score was excellent and set the mood for the whole movie. This movie achieves a high level of suspence/intrigue/thills without the need for explicit blood/gore. The lack of any gratuitous flesh was refreshing. I found the acting to be first rate. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would recommend it to lovers of suspence/thrillers.
4,Spooky!,George C. Scot is very good in this spooky ghost story. The antique wheel chair scared the heck out me the first time I saw the movie.
4,Above The Average Formula For A Haunt-Flick,"Basic Plot: John Russel has lost his family (a wife and daughter) through an auto-accident. Torn apart yet determined to continue life, the pianist/composer moves away to a gigantic old house. But before long, he realizes he's not the only one inhabiting the fortress of creepiness. And, believe it or not, this ghost has a good reason for disturbing the peace.The Changeling surprised me by using just as much (if not more) plot as it did horror. The horrors you'll experience in this film are usually more psychological than visually freaky -- although you will get your share of classic ghost-related images and sounds to help you along. I was expecting a fright-fest, yet instead found quite an interesting and well-constructed storyline. Overall, The Changeling is a great film to satisfy both of your horror needs: Some spooky haunting and an unraveling mystery."
5,The BEST Horror Movie Ever!,"The Changling is a classic scary movie -- ghosts, a fantastic story that unfolds throughout the movie, and a great cast. No teenagers having sex, harsh language or blood, guts and gore. Just an incredibly scary movie -- you'll love it!!"
4,Superior Ghost Story.,"Spine-chilling. If I needed a definition for that word, The Changeling would do it for me. I've seen it several times but a couple of scenes send chills down my spine nonetheless. A ghost story/murder mystery combined, The Changeling is an old-fashioned supernatural tale, eschewing blood & guts for atmosphere & suspense.This is NOT a horror movie. It is a ghost story. An extremely well done ghost story, that got little fanfare when it was released, but is far superior to much of the hyped fare then and since. With a solid cast, led by George C. Scott, the film manages its thrills and chills by technique, i.e., by the adroit use of sound and image, and a carefully crafted buildup of tension. A good story that overcomes any gaps in its internal logic by good acting and skillful direction and production, The Changeling is well worth a look; however, slash and gore lovers need to look elsewhere."
1,Not scary,"I recently ordered The Changeling dvd from Amazon because of all of positive reviews it received. After reading other customer's reviews, I thought that this would be a truly horrifying movie. Personally, I thought that the movie wasn't scary at all. It was extremely boring. I was hoping that this would be an intelligent horror film that was truly scary, but I was proved wrong. The lead character spends the majority of the movie researching the family that once lived in the house.Unless you are terrified by a child's empty wheelchair (the wheelchair is the main ""scare"" in the movie), I would recommend skipping this movie. There are no scares, and the characters aren't interesting. If you want a horror movie that is both intelligent and scary, I recommend ""The Ugly""."
1,A lame excuse for a movie that not even george can save,"The movie was boring and lame. It did not hold my interest at any point and the ending was confusing. George C Scott was okay....it wasn't that great of a movie though. If you want to see a old good movie, get Dracula,I Saw what you did, House on haunted hill or The Haunting (1963)."
5,The Ultimate Classis Ghost Story,"Even after watching ""The Changling"" numerous times..it can still make me jump at the super scary parts. The story line is great and the acting superb. The music is beautiful and haunting. I wish their was a soundtrack with the music box theme on it. This is a great film for sleepovers..just don't expect to sleep after watching it."
3,For a calm night,"It's a good movie, not full of cliches and cheap scares (like actual horror movies), and knows how to keep the suspense in most of times but, personally, I think that something missed. Maybe for its predictible final"
4,Too scary to watch straight through!,"This is one of those wonderfully suspenseful movies that's more suspense than horror. It's SO suspenseful that when it was initially released theatrically, I stayed to watch the lecture hall scene, then left. I'm in that scene, you see. It, and much of the campus stuff, was filmed at the University of Washington in Seattle. Now I'll have to get the DVD just to have that one scene."
3,moderate,"Good,but not brilliant.Old and outdated, yet scary and eerie. Worth while to buy and see for yourself."
5,A very special message and well kept secret.,"I first saw this film listed 2-3 years ago around Halloween ina list of rated horror films. This film had a good rating. I toldmyself I would watch it some day. This Easter weekend I did.I must say that it is one of my favorite movies and I am sure that its probably being remade at this very moment. I had neverseen a George C. Scott flim before, but I know he played Gen. Patton. I have never been into watching war films. I am going to purchase this movie for my collection from Amazon.com. and the movie poster. This film is a little scary, but I did receive ablessing after watching it. This is a film that I have never seenon HBO or regular cable Tv. When it came out I didn't see it atthe theater. I didn't even know what the Changeling meant, but now I do. May George C. Scott rest with our Heavenly Father. I know he passed away in 1999. I enjoyed this film."
5,The Changeling,"Very good and scary movie. Saw years ago on video, DVD makes it so much better. Some say it's better watching it for a second time-you may miss some key facts the first time around. One of my favorites! Highly recommended."
5,The best Ghost Story movie...ever.,"No bodies, zombies, cannibalism, sex, or creepy psychopaths with edged weapons. Just slowly mounting chills and fear that puts chills up my spine when I talk about this movie. George C Scott plays a widower who moves into a historical house in a once-fashionable area of Seattle. After hearing strange noises, he begins to investigate the former occupants, searching for the cause of the disturbances. This movie is simply terrifying. I can't describe the scene where the seance recording is played back without suffering a chill down my spine."
4,Alfred Hitchcock-The Masterpiece Collection,The selection of movies in the collection is just what I wanted. But some of the video's skip and stall.
5,The Best,A great deal with awesome movies. Just missing Dial M for Murder and North By Northwest and I would have been blown away.
2,carefully screen quality,"Hitchock is a master, no doubt, but view all movies soon after purchasing, BEFORE refund expires, to make sure ""remastering"" and production were done right. I received a set with absolutely deplorable audio, and Amazon did not want to take them back before I complained more strongly. I was told ""sometimes there are errors in pressing"" as I argued for a replacement product. Could be it is tough to do quality control with DVDs, but can't be that hard."
5,Magnificent Box Set!,"I didn't even know this was available until I was in a local Best Buy last Sunday (12/18/05)... and I bought it on the spot... for $98.99. Kinda wish I had known about it sooner so I could've paid $10 LESS on Amazon, but even @ $98.99 that works out to only $7.07 p/DVD... and that was a Great Price, too! The remasters are excellent, and the use of the original poster art is cool, too. There are 'complaints' that there's not sufficent Bonus Material? Big deal (or, honestly, ""Get a life!""). Oh, yeah, the 'velvet' box is real nifty, too. If you're a true fan of Hitchcock, this 14-DVD box set is a Must Have!"
3,"5 Stars for the movies, 1 Star for the packaging","I would love to have most of the DVDs in this collection, but I won't get it because of the poorly-designed packaging. I don't want 4 DVDs crammed into one case with the artwork reproduced one-quarter size and overlapping. I want each DVD in its own case with full-sized artwork on the cover. If the idea was to make it more compact, the space saved is insignificant. I think the real reason is corner-cutting to save a few bucks. The other Hitchcock set did it the right way- 1 DVD per case. This is very disappointing. For a lot of us, aesthetics count for a lot. Actually, my ideal preference would be for all box sets to be packaged chronologically, in the order each film was released."
3,You must be a Hitchcock fan to appreciate this,"The DVD boxes are not the best quality, but the illustrations are superb. Hitchcock is a classic (in the sense of Twain): get a lot of praise but no one sees many of his films. I personally had not seen all of Hitchcock films, and I must confess that some of them are pretty boring. Still worth having this collection."
5,Alfred Hitchcock - The Masterpiece Collection,"This is a great collection of Hitchcock's best at a great price. Packaged well, too; great for display."
1,I would guess that this is a wonderful collection.,"This collection looks interesting and should be a good value for the money, however, as it never arrived, I can't give it a better rating."
5,suspense the olde fashioned way,"I never enjoyed Hitchcock as much as I have enjoyed it now; recently hosted a homemade film festival with this collection and found it to be scintillating and fun; to watch the Master at work. The price was amazing, considering some of the films contained should be considered classics in their own right: ""Psycho"" ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". Nobody has ever made films like Hitchcock and probably never will, either, especially today when there is too much reliance on F/X."
5,Great box set of classic Hitchcock...,"I received this set as a Christmas gift and I couldn't be more delighted. Up until this year I had been trying to gather my Hitchcock DVD collection piece by piece- but this set did it for me!This set has most of the major films Hitchcock lovers want- like Psycho and The Birds- along with some not as acclaimed but just as entertaining films like Torn Curtain and Rope. The only thing missing is Cary Grant, but there are other collections for those who need North by Northwest or Notorious. I was very impressed to find two of my personal favorites in this collection: Marnie and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Marnie also includes a rather interesting documentary featurette.The packaging, as others have said, is not fantastic...but it's adequate and I find the crushed velvet casing quite charming.I don't think Hitchcock fans should have any worries about purchasing this collection...14 films for a reasonable price, what more could we ask for?"
1,Very bad reproduction quality--we feel cheated,"The masterpieces contained here are ruined by sloppy reproduction, veering from light to dark unpredictably. sometimes obscuring images. This happens on different DVD players, so the discs themselves are at fault. We feel cheated. It will make me think twice about ordering from Amazon."
1,come on,"the versions released a few years ago of Vertigo and Rear Window are great widescreen editions. it doesn't include To Catch a Thief or North by Northwest (the one they really need to restore). i won't be purchasing, what a joke"
4,One problem,The only thing that was a problem was that one of my disc was scratch. not amazons fault but the manufactures. i clean the disc up and it seems to work so they get a 4 out of 5.
4,Extra Ordinary and well restored!,"Most of us, Hitchcock fans, often feel we have seen these films several times. I must admit I watched all 14 and enjoyed them for the ""first time"" again. The restoration is extremely good and makes one realize that, if one had seen them before, it was always of very poor quality. I recommend it to anyone who is a ""Hitch"" fan.Louis Castelli, Ph.D."
2,"Ok, however","The movie came very fast and I was very happy. The movie Vertigo skips and does not play right. I have not had a chance to watch all the other movies. I believe the problem is within the disc manufacturer, not the seller."
4,"Good collection, but ...","Where is North By Northwest? For a masterpiece collection that tries to capture the best of Hitchcock, they've left out one of his very best films."
5,THE MASTER IS BACK !,HITCHCOCK IS LIKE ELVIS AND TUPAC...HE DON'T DIE EASY. THIS WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!
2,another good boxset bad cover art,The reason i gave it two stars was because they released pretty much the same movies a dozen times it seems like. Plus whats up with picture on the box!!!!! the only reason there realsing his movies in diffrent boxsets over over again is because of the greedy company. But dont get me wrong its a pretty good set
2,IGGY UNHAPPY,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPOINTED BY THE PACKAGING. GROUPING THE FILMS IN PACKAGES OF 4 MAKES THE SET LOOK LIKE A CHEAPO PUBLIC DOMAINE RELEASE. THE ADVERTISING NEVER MENTIONED THIS FACT, WHICH IS REALLY FALSE ADVERTISING. THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON THE RUNNING TIME OF THE FILMS, WHICH IS UNFORGIVABLE IN A BOX SET LIKE THIS. THE YEAR OF PRODUCTION IS BURIED IN THE BOOKLET AND THE MUSIC INTRODUCING THE FILM IS FROM HITCHCOK'S TV SHOW, AGAIN A VERY UNFORTUNATE CHOICE.ALL IN ALL, EXTREMELY DISAPOINTING FOR A SET PRICED OVER $100"
2,"GET A LIFE YOURSELF, MIKEY","I repeat my earlier observation - The profile drawing of Alfred Hitchcock (done by Mr. Hitchcock himself) was ALWAYS associated with the TELEVISION SERIES, NOT ANY OF HIS MOVIES!!! So WHY such an ILLOGICAL choice to put that picture on a MOVIE collection and NOT on the television collection?"
2,good dvd bad cover art,The reason i gave it two stars was because they released pretty much the same movies a dozen times it seems like. Plus whats up with picture on the box!!!!! the only reason there realsing his movies in diffrent boxsets over over again is because of the greedy company. But dont get me wrong its a pretty good set
3,"One of the DVD movies doesn't play - error message ""Incorrect Disc""","I bought this excellent collection as a Christmas gift. Very enjoyable - except for ""Saboteur"" because it won't play, error message ""Incorrect Disc."" It took us quite a while to get through all the movies - it's now March 5, 07. We wish there were a way to get the Saboteur DVD replaced, but there doesn't seem to be. So be prepared for a possible corrupted disc in the collection...."
5,The Master of Scare and Suspense,Can't wait to watch these with my kids - I've told them so much about Hitchcock they can't wait to be scared without blood and gore. The packaging is great on this - the cover slips off and into a slot.
5,A Must For Any Serious Hitchcock Fan,"If you are a serious Hitchcock fan you owe it to yourself to acquire this collection. Although not an exhaustive collection of his feature films, this beautifully boxed compilation is wonderfully remastered to the best presentation of black and white films I have ever seen. Images are crisp and well defined and the digital sound restoration is superb as well. Watching these DVDs it is hard to believe the age of the masters from which they were derived. What a fine restoration of the works of the master of suspense and, oh yes, absolute master of the unexpected twist at the end of each tale spun."
5,Hitchcock collection,"What a steal! This was the best price I could find for the collection and I feel BAD getting such a bargain! The collection is amazing. Some of the titles I have not seen before, but they did not disappoint! You MUST buy this collection, Hitchcock fan or not! It has made Saturday night ""Movie Night"" much more interesting!"
4,A good buy for any Hitchcock Fan,"AT the time that I bought these they were a special and an excellent buy. I especially wanted Rear Window which is my favorite of Hitchcock and I got 13 other movies for about $4.00 per movie. I have not watched them all but the ones I have seen are excellent quality with subtitles--something I desire because of being hard of hearing. I did not know that they would have subtitles and I was concerned about that. (I wish that Amazon would mention this in all their ""ads"" for DVDs. For any Hitchcock fan as I am this is an excellent buy. Even if there are some that you might not buy, you are really getting them for free if you had to pay the usual price for the ones that you do want . The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have not seen all of them yet. This review was solicited but no renumeration was given so you can believe what I say."
4,A GREAT SET FOR THE PRICE! MISSING SOME GREAT FILMS!,"I didn't have any of these films on DVD, so..... When I saw it on sale for around $65.00 I thought it was a great deal for 14 films with some great extra material. I would have liked to see a few different films in this set, but they ended up putting most of those in another DVD set with the exception of ""LifeBoat"" and ""Notorious"". I think all ""Hitches"" missing films should be put into similar sets. This is a nice set, but wait to see it at the right price. These will be dropping way down before you know it. The transfers look crisp and clean with excellent audio!I've only watched a handful so far and my ratings will be added as I finish each film.1)Psycho 5 stars2)The Birds 4 3/4 stars3)Marnie 3 3/4 stars4)Torn Curtain 3 stars"
5,re-released AND anamorphic!,"Unlike what some have claimed, this set is most definitely remastered and not just a simple ""repackaging"" of previously-released versions.I have purchased and confirmed that indeed, movies such as Vertigo and Psycho which were not anamorphic in their prior release are indeed anomorphic widescreen in this release. And, the menus have been updated, etc.Not all movies in this set are anamorphic - because not all were released in widescreen format.However, the anamorphic/widescreen releases in this set are: The Birds, Marnie, Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Torn Curtain, Frenzy, Family Plot, The Trouble with Harry, and Topaz.The set would have been ""flawless"" if it included North by Northwest, but I suspect that it wasn't because this title is owned by Warner, not Universal (who released this set)."
5,Love This Cream,"I was given this in the hospital,and loved this cream. It is great for moisterizing and really stays with you. I highly recommend this cream."
1,Disappointed!,"As a huge April Wine fan I was also disappointed with this disc like the other reviewers.I assumed it was a video disc with 5.1 audio but after loading itinto my DVD player I realized it wasn't, much to my chagrin. (Perhaps it wasan oversight on my part). That being said, the (so called) 5.1 audio is lousy.It's obviously a dated live concert and some of the (in between) track cutsare very abrupt and poorly done. For the price I paid for this disc I feel rippedoff! Save your hard earned cash and skip this disc!"
5,Constant is wrong.,"Constant is just a cry baby backpacker who does not know real hip hop and its true elements of the street. This album is straight fire. Sure the album has lots of this and that, but thats life. Get used to it."
2,G. LUGERS,"IT WAS OKAY. BEING THAT THESE CATS ARE OUT OF GERMANY IT AMAZING HOW FAR HIP HOP REACHES. THE BEATS ARE GOOD AND THE ORDER OF SONGS FIT FROM ONE TO THE NEXT. HOW EVER THE LUGGERS RAPPING LIKE O.G'S WAS UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I WAS NOT FAMILIAR ANY OF THEM. NO DIS TO THEM BUT IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO SOUND HARD, YOU KNOW?"
2,May have some value as a bibliography,"This long book summarizes folktale scholarship and provides an annotated bibliography of books and films (both children's and adult) based on folktales. The authors are unfortunately not up to the task, and their book reads like a first draft or a compilation of undergraduate work. Attempts to explain folklore theories are clumsy and confusing."
5,Alot of fun to read,"My 7 and 4 yr old boys love this story. We all get giggling so hard when we read it. (Course, I read it with a little twang for Aunt Nancy, and a deep-goofy voice for Cousin Lazybones...so that adds to it.) This is a fun book to read over and over again."
3,Refills?,"My husband is quite happy with this as his birthday gift. I am a little embarrassed that I can't find refills for i thought.It works well, feels good in the hand. If I can't find refills for it, it will be a very expensive disposable razor."
4,The South Is comin Up!,"Finally, a cd about money thats actually pretty good. I know its a worn out subject, but Yungstar just really does it differently. For those of you who dont know him or the screwed up click, this is just a release of his slammin underground debut. The only problem, though, is the fact that they took the tightest song ever off of here: June 27th. The song was nearly 20 minutes long! With just as many artists, from Lil Keke to SPM, and none of it was weak. I would recommend this cd instead because it has a second disc with more great songs on it. But if I were you id get averything with this young man on it. Because he is very talented and just hasnt blown up yet. He just never runs out of throwed off stuff to say! You really got to get this one."
5,Great Book: Best book on Electronic commerce,"I really liked the way the authors describedthe management issues in electronic commerce. This book is definitely among the first that looks at the internals of electronic commerce from two perspectives:Customer-to-Business: online banking, retailing and publishingIntra-Business: supply chain management, customer asset management, manufacturing and logistics.Definitely recommend the book to anyone who wants to know about E-commerce."
1,"Boring, dry, out of date - useless to anyone who's serious.",There are few books that have not even one nugget to take away from them. This is one of them. The content is out of date and is irrelevant to someone actually trying to build an online business. The authors are consistent in focusing on the wrong things. It is a painfully boring read and a huge waste of time!
4,Recommended Primer on E-commerce,"An excellent book. The first book that got me interested in buying books on E-commerce. Most books in the past has been too expensive. I did not want to spend on expensive books until I am sure I am interested in knowing more and know what aspect of E-commerce for in-depth reading. After reading this book, I went on to buy other books on various aspects of E-commerce for more in-depth reading. Highly recommended for beginners and this book has a lot of information for the intermediate category too. Recommended for any managers who has been asked by the CEO to look into E-commerce and make a presentation on it. This would be one of the books I would refer to whenever I need to do anything with regard to E-commerce to ensure I do not miss out any aspect of E-commerce. If you are into E-commerce, buy it."
1,Technically inaccurate and confused,Having been given this book as a must read by my corporation I have to say I expected more than this - the information is presented in a muddled and confused format - meaningless comparisons are made - for instance between HTML and PDF. The overall impression you get on reading this is that the authors have taken a few books on anything they can find internet related - and then attempted to summarise their introductions. If the objective is to supply managers with a meaningful uptodate picture of ecommerce then they fail totally. Useful as a door stopper.
4,Great One-Stop reference for Electronic Commerce,"I am a Consultant in the field of Electronic Commerce in Bombay, India and let me confess that all my preachings these days are based on this book.The book provides excellent macro view of fast changing and often confusing world of electronic commerce.Will look forward to more titles from authors."
4,Great read.,"Welcome to the real world of E-Commerce. A thorough explanation of how this area of IT is, and will be, looked at for business related concerns. It gets a little too much into the importance of intranets however the relevance is crucial for new business models. This book is on par with Mougayar's on Digital Markets, a must if you want to get into EC."
4,A perfect present for your boss,"My boss (CIO) asked me to buy her a book that discussed EC comprehensively. I researched several titles and chose this book. This is the best book to be found that is ideal for a CIO to read, it discusses virtually all aspects of EC, and yet is technical enough to indicate the complexity of the subject. I have a much easier time discussing our EC Strategy with the CIO now that she has digested this book. I have since purchased a copy for my bookshelf as well."
5,Extremely well researched and written,"I work in IT consulting, and am closely involved in implementation of Internet /Intranet / Extranet solutions. As such e-commerce is one area foremost in our focus, and for me Kalakota and Whinston 's book has become an essential reference text. Many of the key issues we grapple with (eg security, payment mechanisms, legal issues, applicability of Internet technology for different business sectors) are clearly and comprehensively covered within this deceptively slim book. I hope the authors will be coming up with more works in the same vein"
1,"If you like seeing McDonald's Adverts, this is the game!","Decent gameplay totally degraded by Mcdonald's restaurants advertising signage plastered everywhere on the boards and stadium.Not subtle at all like the adidas adverts - bold,loud, and annoying to see... we should be payed to play this game and be bombarded by adverts. What in the hell does terrible food that's terrible for your health have to do with football !I'm disappointed, dismayed, and degraded !I have written asking for a full refund!Boycott advertising in games !TV is bad enough!pacruderockfamily.com"
5,Best game ever,"This is the best soccer game ever; you cannot imagine how real and how exiting until you play it. If you love soccer, you will love this game. It gives you updated information about the teams and the players. I strongly recommend this game."
5,Monster,Excellent crossword book. Puzzles are not extremely hard but just difficult to test your brain.
4,GREAT VALUE!!!,"Having owned this watch for over 6 months now, I'm really impressed, especially for the price tag of around $100. It's well built, definitely a man's watch as it's kind of weighty. Its time keeping feature is quite acurate for its being an automatic. It definitely can sustain repeated abuse, to a certain degree. I had to send mine back to the company for repair under warranty as the bezzel had come loosed. But that was in no mean of affecting the functionality of the watch though, that's definitely a GOOD THING."
2,Annoying and irritating,"There are two fundamental problems with this book. First, the level of user at whom it is pitched is very low. If you know where the power switch on your computer can be found, you will probably not learn much here that you didn't already know. Second, the layout and design of the book is awful. Every page is a mass of lines pointing to the applicable place on a screenshot where the feature under discussion can be found. It makes looking for and trying to read the material in which you are interested a confusing and unhappy experience. My advice to anyone interested in acquiring a useful Mac Office 2004 reference book is to look elsewhere."
5,Funniest Quote Book Out There,"350 pages of great quotes, many, many of them are new to me - unlike other quote books that seem to recycle the same old boring flat quotes.This book is a breath of fresh air and is so wickedly satisfying.Many of the quotes can be used on yur friends or enemies ... great fun all round. It's a must for a gift book ..."
2,It was different,This book of qoutes is a very good coloection of qoutes that would not be found anywhere else. None of the quotes are very memorable though. The quotes can be used for nothing at all useful. They might be entertaining to some but I felt that they were just stupid usless random quotes. If you are a sports fan or have a favorite movie star then this might be a good book for you. They quote famous people but they arent the best known quotes. I just might have been disapointed because it wasnt what I was looking for.
1,Not for runners,This thing does not stay up when running. I pulled the velcro bands really tight & then it would stay up but could tell circulation to my lower leg was suffering.
5,Best knee brace if you just need a little support,"I love the fact that this velcros on so that you can put it on after you've already put on socks and shoes -- don't have to slide it up your leg like some. I also like the mesh around the kneecap that lets out sweat, and there's also a rubberized flange around the edge of the mesh that helps to stabilize the knee. I just need a little extra support when I exercise, and this does the trick. If you need serious knee support, you may need something more heavy duty, but this works perfectly for me."
5,LOVE,"usually knee supports are nasty and they don't really feel good because you can feel that something is on you. with this knee support, you don't feel that at all. Its very comfortable and helps with injuries."
1,Knee Brace,The description says One Size...not true. It doesn't stretch much ann I couldn't fasten the bottom velcro. Needs more stretch.
5,"WOW, very confortable!","i have to say this knee support is the best purchase ever! it really helps me do my exercises with no trouble what so ever!!!love it, love it, love it."
1,Flimsy,"I am 30yr, lean, active woman. I run about 9-16 miles per week and do Crossfit. I was recently diagnosed with patellar tendonitis or Jumper's Knee. I bought this brace hoping it would support my knee, especially since it had piping. Today I ran 3 miles today; the brace moved around and was flimsy. The piping kept the brace on the sides but that's about it. I was really disappointed and would not recommend it."
3,ONLY 1,"As it turns out, this only comes with one, for some reason i thought it was a set. It also appears to be white, but is in fact a dark gray color. The product quality was pretty good, just know the color is off, and you'll only get 1 brace"
2,Disappointed,"I thought this would be a cut above the rest, the catch is its geared for women. I found it no better than any of the others I've tried."
2,Blew out the mesh,"I bought this brace for work because I do a lot of bending and twisting in my job and within about a week I had pulled apart the mesh from the gel of the knee brace, no longer getting kneecap support. so I had to buy a better knee brace within a week and I wouldn't recommend anybody that is bending past a 90* angle buy this product"
4,Too small but according to pkg it should be too big for me,"Fits easily around my thigh but way to small on my calf. the thing needs to be about 4"" longer to wrap around below my knee. NOT 1 size fits all. According to the pkg it should be too big for me. If you are within the height/weight requirements be aware that if you are very muscular, it still may not fit you."
2,"One size DOES NOT fit all, TOO SMALL","I purchased this based on the reviews and the fact that many reviews said it was way to big for them which is what I need. I have a larger knee with a larger thigh and calf and thought it would work for me. I am 5'5"" and weight 190 lbs. so it is definitely not suited for the larger woman (size 16-18). I feel like I need a brace that would fit a football players leg. I will have to keep looking for the right knee support."
5,Finally a knee support built for women...,"I purchased this after having to return two knee supports that I purchased at the drug store and a sporting goods store. Both were size small but too large for me and would end up down around my ankle. This one is perfect, adjustable but doesn't bunch up and not very noticeable under pants. And definitely fit for a woman's body. Highly recommended, in fact, I'm going to buy more of their stuff just in case I ever need it!"
1,no good,"Item does not fit well nor stay on well. Slides around. I do not recommend product as it does not provide adequate support. Also, contrary to some reviews I read this item IS bulky and does not fit well under pants. I am a size 4 to 6 if that helps."
1,Offers Little...Very Little...Support,"I admit that I purchased this because I wanted something lightweight to wear under my dress slacks. This is light weight, but bulky at the same time. Even though this is a wrap support with velcro, the excess material from the one-size-fits-all creates way too much bulk behind the knee. It offers little to no support, but yet is very constricting and painful if you need to bend your knee. I was going to return it, but the shipping charges just didn't make it worth doing."
4,Wellgate knee support,I was happy with the brace until I got an allergic reaction to it. Before I purchased it I read all of the information very carefully to see what the composition was and was unable to find it. I knew I had an allergy to Neoprene and wouldn't have made the purchase had I known. The return was easy enough but I didn't receive payment for shipping.Dolores
3,"Non-abbrasive, but bulky","Tried using these in place of the neoprene bands, and I can't get accustomed to the bulkiness. the adjustable straps are another thing to fuss with and some mornings I have to adjust a couple of times to get the pressure and position right. I think the generic slip-on supports are more for me.Neoprene Knee Support"
2,Does not give measurements for the 1 size.,The 1 size fits small or thin legs. Is not meant for muscular or large to extra large leg diameter.
4,A lot less pain,"After banging my knee on the corner of a cedar chest, I was in pain for weeks, especially climbing my stairs & talking my daily walk of 3 miles. After wearing the Wellgate Gel-comfort knee brace for just a few days, the pain was greatly reduced...it keeps the knee stable & is very easy to put on & is comfortable & breathable...I'm so glad I found this product...give it a try...I think you will like it!"
1,too big,Its true the size does not fit all women am 63 Kg and my height is 160 cm and still too big.
1,no support,"I purchased this product in the summer for knee support. The material wrap is incredibly hot, soaking wet when I took it off and the sweat on my leg was incredible. After wearing it for a few hours, the sweat was so intense, the wrap would slip down my leg. It didn't provide any knee support."
4,very nice,"This is a very nice journal. It has a great ""old"" look to it, and I like the magnetic flap that seals it shut. My only complaint is that the lines on the pages are very light and difficult to follow."
5,Awesome Journal,"I just love this journal...the look, the feel, everything. I really like the quality of the writing paper; it's thick, yet not too thick, and it just feels almost like a linen paper. I really like that it's lined; I hate journals that are blank...they just seem like doodle-pads to me. Anyone who enjoys writing, and writing on nice paper that will last, would love it. Just looking at the journal gives me a royal, regal feeling (it must be the deep richness of the red accented by the gold foil), and whatever I write in it just seems that much more special to me!!!"
5,Beautiful Lined Journal,"It doesn't matter that this Journal doesn't look like leather; it looks as though it isn't supposed to. It stands on its own as a work of fine craftsmanship covered with exquisite foiled paper with deliberate blemishes to give it an old-world look. It is definitely above average as Journals go and is hardbound and larger than most for more room to write. For yourself or as a special gift that is sure to be appreciated by any Journal writer, this fits the bill.My only slight complaint is that the prices for these new Journals are comparable to store prices, and I look to Amazon for bargains. Other than that though, this is indeed a nice item."
3,Question,"This isn't really an online review but I was wondering if this book also talked about losing a grandparent because a week ago I lost my grama who I was very, very close to.And I'm looking for a book to help me with losing her, because I feel so sad and mad and alone.So if anyone can e-mail me....thanks lots."
4,A classic in any language,I found that this was a good exercise for me to practice my translation skills while at the same time telling my five year old a story that she can understand. We are looking forward to a transfer to Germany and have started teaching the kids German.
2,Keep your money for something extra,"I picked this book up at library booksale last weekend as it sounded interesting, but it was anything but interesting once I started reading it.The author has put together a series of stories from the Lakeside, CA (near San Diego) Police Senior citizens patrol. The first scene is that of a shooting in the local school. The narrator expresses disbelief that this could happen in her small town and from there the cliched phrases and writing just gets worse. The author obviously knows her police work as she explains the idioms, procedures, and facts. But the heart that should be in the story is never quite there. The writing is just too trite for the reader to care about the scenes/crimes/patrols the author discusses.Save your extra change and pass this one up."
1,A significant decrease in sudden infant death syndrome.: An article from: Medical Update [HTML] (Digital),A total rip off. No useful information
4,Works great!,This handsfree works great and I feel safer driving now - but it didn't come with any documentation and I had to search online to get a manual and find out how to pair my phone. Why have a good product and then spoil the experience with a bad first impression?
4,BlueAnt Supertooth II Speakerphone,"I think this is a great product. It has great sound for both the sender and the receiver. It's very easy to set up and no installation is required. I use it in my work vehicle, my personal vehicle, and I set it on my desk and use it. I can pair it to multiple phones so my wife can use it also. The only negative I have found with it is that when the battery starts getting low my reception suffers greatly. That being said, I only have to recharge it every two weeks and I use it at least 2 hours a day. Another great feature for me, since I am constantly in and out of my vehicle at work, is that I can simply close the mic and it disconnects from my phone, then when I get back in the truck, I simply open the mic and it reconnects. I don't have to worry about being 30 feet away before it disconnects.It really is a great product, worth the money!"
4,good product,"Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next. The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't consistently automatically connect to the LG enV phone after pairing the two devices together. Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial, it won't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button. Overall the product is a good product, but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies."
1,Not fully compatible,"Did not work well with my LG VX8300 using latest V03 firmware.. outgoing audio was very bad, incoming very good. Headset volume menu keeps popping up on phone even though the unit is paired as handsfree"
1,Product is a complete failure,Have has several Bluetooth units in the past. I wanted a non-contact unit for the wife. I paired the Supertooth II to her Motorola W490. The voice transmission is so choppy that you can not undrstand what is being said. Another $125.00 for the junk box. The vendor CCMA Accessories does not give refunds nor does Amazon. You may want to visit Best buy or some other reputable store
1,Completely useless,"I was very excited about this product based on the reviews. However, that quickly diminished when I discovered a major bug which completely makes this unit useless. It will not reconnect automatically when either handset or supertooth has been powered off then on or when the units go out of range of each other and then back in. Customer support at Blueant told me that this will never be fixed because the product was discontinued. I have 3 cell phones; a vx8300, v8700, and a RAZR V3M. I have two headsets; a Voyager 510 and a Z9. Both headsets auto reconnect with all 3 phones as they should. The Supertooth II is the first bluetooth handsfree I've ever had that did not do this. It's going back."
2,Supertooth II microphone volume too low,I was thrilled when I first received this Bluetooth Speakerphone. I had no problems pairing it with my Cingular RAZR V3. It worked as expected the first couple of weeks I had it except after about 1 week the bright metal speaker cover dropped off. I superglued it back in place. Then after another week or so I received complaints that I could hardly be heard. I can find no mention in the manual of a way to increase the microphone sensitivity.I've been through reseting the phone and re-pairing it withthe cellphone but I still can't be heard.What a disappointment... I guess it's back to my old Motorola HS-850 Headset!Jack MacBlueAnt Bluetooth Portable Handsfree Supertooth II Handsfree Speakerphone
3,"nice, but some problems with LG VX8300","i purchased the supertooth ii (""S2"") for use with my LG VX8300 phones. the quality and design are excellent. the swivel arm seems a little fragile though. sound and voice quality are excellent.my only issue is compatibility with my LG VX8300 phone. i successfully paired the S2 with my phone, but there are a few quirks with how it works: (1) the S2 is a bit slow to connect to the phone after turning it on (flipping the swivel arm out). also, it would have been nice to have some audible indicator that the devices are connected, as i have with my blueant X3 headset. (2) the pick-up/hang-up button doesn't always activate my voice dialing menu on my phone. i've tried pairing with both the handsfree and headset profile, with the same result. finally (3) the pick-up/hang-up button does not always hang up the call or exit out of any active voice command menus.it's a nice device. i wish that it worked better with my phone."
2,Blue Ant Hands Free,"The unit is merely adequate for use in the car. The speaker is the major drawback as it has a very tinny sound. All ambient noise (such as the AC and heating fan) must be eliminated. There is an inherent echo noted by many callers. You have to speak up to assure that you are heard. It also takes a long time to bond with the phone's bluetooth (phone is an LG Chocolate).All in all the unit works but it lacks dynamic sound in both sending and receiving. Possibly this is a problem with bluetooth connectivity but the unit does not give the overall impression of quality construction.Prior to this, had a Motorola phone which had a hard-wire hook up to a Motorola portable spekerphone unit. This was far superior sound-wise to the Blue Ant."
4,BLUE ANT-great hands free option,"After having tried countless methods, wires, wireless earbuds, etc...this has turned out to be the best option for me. As a sales rep who spends quite a bit of time in a car, this is a nice safe option to holding the phone, and has much better perfomance than an earbud. My husband bought a Motorola device in the similar price range to this unit, and is considering returning it and going for a Blue Ant.The speaker phones microphone works well enough to pick up voices of passengers in the 3rd row of my minivan. Nice volume control on unit.Inexpensive option for the convenience and performance. Holds a charge for a LONG time."
3,works most of the time,"Like every electronic device I have ever had, there are always some glitches.It works most of the time with little problem. Does not automatic pair to the phone, you must hit the answer switch on the blue ant everytime you get into the car. Once you do that it will ask you to say a command, if you are not calling someone and do not want to hit end on your phone, I say check time and it will give me the time and date. Once in a while I here a beep from the phone and it has disconnected itself. Twice I have not been able to connect the phone to the device. If that happens you must remove the battery from the phone and wait a min. and reinstall. Even with the problems I would still recommend this device."
2,Not up to expectations,"While the Supertooth II is functional, it does not live up to the expectations of some of the rave reviews.The speaker quality is scratchy and there was feedback issues for the recipient of my calls.Functional but not fabulous, I had to return this item."
4,hands free,"The Blue Ant handsfree unit works well, however it disconnects from the phone at frequent intervals. This happens more often than it does with my Motorola ear piece."
5,Extraordinary,Excellent reception from the cell phone. Excellent speaker. Very easy setting. I will buy another one for a collegue.
3,"Works ok, but needs mounts.","As other reviews have said, this works quite well as a bluetooth speaker phone. However, the visor clip on mine kept slipping on the visor, resulting in the phone moving around. When I moved the phone to the other end of the visor, hoping that being closer to the connection to the car instead of a snap that held it in place would result in less vibration and hence less motion, it failed to cover the road noise. I suspect this is more a problem with my car, in that the visor bounces more and is slippery, than with the speakerphone, but it stillwent back."
4,Great handsfree device,"I really like this handsfree speakerphone. People don't know that I'm not talking on my cell phone when I use it. The only thing I have noticed is that it really causes my battery on the phone to drain quickly. Other than that, I really love it. Everyone that rides in my car asks what it is and then when they see it being used they like it too."
4,Good -- Not Perfect,"I picked this up for my wife for Christmas to use with her Cingular RAZR V3. Overall it is working pretty well, but it's not perfect. Setup was easy, and sound quality is pretty good -- on both ends. The noise supression is excellent -- when I talk to her I can't tell she is in a car. The background is totally quiet.The negatives have been mentioned by other reviewers. Mainly the unit is slow to pair when you turn it on. So if you forget to turn it on in the car you'll have to answer your call on the phone first, then tell your party to ""hold on"" while you turn on the Supertooth and let the call transfer. Also the unit has no voice dialing built in -- so you're stuck with whatever your phone supports. Finally it has no Mute button which would be handy for use on concalls.So overall it works OK. Not great, but does the job."
2,BlueAnt Bluetooth Portable Handsfree Supertooth II handsfree speakerphone,Got it to easily work with my Blackberry but EVERYONE I talk to on it complains about the sound quality.Well built device but poor performance reviews from the people that I talk to...Sorry!Not recommended by me!
2,Battery can't be replaced - buy a new unit!,"This is a throw away product as the battery can't be replaced. The company says that if the battery fails after the warrantee period, you have to buy a new unit. They refuse to state an upper temperature limit, even though the unit is to be used in a car that can go to 140 degrees easy."
1,Not so super!,"*Pickup/Hangup button intermittant at first, now completely inop*Voice commands unrecognized through Supertooth. Works fine on elcheapo headset.*When I am able to pick up a call the speaker sounds like Charlie Brown's dad talking through a tin can.*No response from manufacturer on warranty inquiry."
2,Does not fit,I purchased the item for my SUV and tried to attach the speaker phone to my sun visor. It does not fit. My sun visor is too thick so I can not find another place to secure it. You might want to check your sun visor before purchasing the item.
3,Blue Ant Bluetooth Portable Speakerphone,"The speakerphone works mostly well, but it occasionally drops out or the sound breaks up. I don't like the on/off switch. You have to flip the microphone boom up to turn it on. I would prefer it had a separate switch so I could use it with the boom flat."
1,What A Piece OF JUNK,"Evan the support team can't help with this Product.I want to upgrade to new Firmware, they cant helpThere BlueAnt Q1 updater 2.00 will not load the updatesI hold Amazon responsible for letting this product to besold on there website. It IS JUNK"
4,Good Quality - Not for Blackberry,"My Blackberry was not producing good call quality via this device. I was not sure whether it was the phone, service or speaker phone, but I got tired of it not working to my expectations. The volume never seemed to be loud enought and the person on the other end of the call always had to strain to hear me. They kept saying I sounded like I was in a tin can."
2,Only fair,"There are two things that I don't like about the BlueAnt. First, when it connects with my Blackberry, it causes the Blackberry to ""say a number"" and I'm required to exit from that command. My other bluetooth earphones don't do this. Second, it seems to cut in and out for the listener on the other end."
5,Good stuff!! Best Blue Tooth Unit so far! Jan 2007,"This is an excellent unit with long battery life. Especailly when you can easily turn it off and on as needed. It has a flip down mic that turns the unit on and when you leave your car just flip it back up. The standby time on this (with the mic flipped On position) is i believe a week. I had this thing sit in my car for a week with out charging and it showed no sign of need to charger. I've only charged it twice since I bought it two months back. It's speaker is strong, clear and loud with volume control. The mic is clear at NORMAL tone... you don't have to yell or even raise your voice that much. You can talk like you were in the library. I give great ratings and reccomend it to all who drive!"
4,Does the job.,"Works great! The speaker sound is excellent. Comes with a home and car charger, very handy to have both. Good buy for the price."
3,Works with my phone,"But not with my Wife's. Wouldn't auto par with my wife's phone. I took it in to the sprint store to see if my wife's phone was the problem, but they couldn't find anything wrong with her phone paring with other bluetooth products, perhaps the stereo function of her phone was the problem? Not sure, great sound though and worked great with my phone, wish it would have worked out. Sent it back in, was happy with return to CCM Electronics."
5,Works great!,"I have used this speakerphone for about a year now and it is great. Everyone in the car can talk on it including the kids in the back seat. Great loud, clear volume. The battery lasts for weeks. Easy to set up and use. Just remember to charge it every two or three months."
2,Can you hear me now?,"I was really excited to give this to my wife at Christmas. Being a passenger when she's frantically searching for her cell phone in traffic can really be irritating. Unfortunately the dangerous behavior will continue as the item fell short of my expectations. The speaker was loud and clear on incoming calls, but the mic wasn't sensitive enough which resulted in the receivers of outgoing calls having a difficult time understanding what was being said. I may have to go with an ear peice and mic attached to her instead of the remote unit on the visor."
4,Works well but can be quirky,"I am very happy with this product although it is not perfect. It's sound works really well for me, both for my listening as well as the person on the other end. I had/have three issues with it but none are killers. First, because the roof/sunvisor in my car (a Mazda3) is low, when this is clipped to the visor you see it out of the corner of your eye and it is distracting. However, after a few days you get used to it and you no longer notice it. Second, sometimes on an incoming call it does not transfer automatically to the unit. When you then hit the answer button on the actual phone, it suddenly switches to the unit. Not sure why this happens, which is about 10% of the time. Third, as might be expected, the battery does not last as long as advertised. I find I need to charge it about once a week, and I do not use it heavily at all. However, all in all it does exactly what I need it to do, so I am pleased with the item."
1,Doesn't work correctly.,Unit would not pick up calls initiated from the phone unless the previous call had been initiated from the unit itself.
2,"Can't answer with device if off when the phone rings, won't sync to answer","On occation, I'll forget to turn the device on. When the phone rights, I flip the mic down to turn it on, but it won't sync quickly enough to allow hands free answering. Pretty useless unless you always leave it on and then run the risk of running down the battery if it forget to turn it off or charge it. I find it a disappointing product."
3,Okay but not so clear sound,There are connection issues when the phone enters the bluetooth range. It does not automatically connect. Sound is not so clear on the other side. People have issues hearing you. Battery lasts pretty long and it comes with a car charger so that's a positive. Overall its an okay product. Serves the purpose.
5,Supertooth II speakerphone,The Supertooth II has been in use for approximately two weeks and I find it to do as advertised. It's nice to be able to keep the phone in my pocket and respond to a call.
5,Excellent Music,The music composed by A.R.Rahman for this movie is fabulous. The songs are very well written by Javed Akhtar and the music is just stupendous. Good Buy !!!
5,songs,is it important to write in few words about the review . yes the songs are really wonderful. my daughter loves it and she is 21/2 years she loves to sings this song along it. thankyou.
5,"Possibly Unknown to most, but Beautiful to the ones who do","The most beautiful music I have heard in the longest time. I may be hearing-impaired, but this music sings flawlessly to my eardrums. I turn the music up so loudly, my neighbor would pound on my door to keep it down!I absolutely love ""Waltz for a Romance"". I cried when I first heard it and watched it on film. Even with Elizabeth, the British woman, singing alongside the two of them, it is a beautiful song. In fact, putting her in the mix of the song only made it better. And no, I am not Hindi. I am an ordinary American who just happens to love the film and the music.So, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. This is an awesome soundtrack and very well-deserved to listen to! It is a perfect buy at a great price! I would pay more for this than just [$$]. Go see the movie too. You won't regret it, except for those who are really sad people and really don't care about the others, of course. heh."
5,Quality Bollywood Soundtrack,"Even without seeing this amazing film, you can appreciate the music. Many Bollywood soundtracks are unoriginal or make a botched attempt to mix Western esthetics (offensive synthesizers etc) with traditional Indian elements, but this soundtrack both defies convention and is loaded with songs that are at the same time modern and 100% Indian. Fabulous percussion parts show how traditional Indian rhythms can totally groove, and the slow songs bring you to tears even when you can't understand the words (though watching the movie will help those of us who don't speak Hindi). I loved the music so much after seeing the film without subtitles in India that I bought this soundtrack there; now that I've just seen the film w/ subtitles I can say that for most of the songs, the lyrics are great, too. One song is kind of marred by a horrid, cheesy English-language interlude, but otherwise it's all powerful, wonderful music. Good stuff. Check it out and you won't be disappointed."
3,A worthwhile resource for the gluten intolerant,"This book would be best for the reader just learning about gluten intolerance. It provides the reader with very good advice about how to use gluten-free flours and whole grains.Unfortunately, it has very little information for those of us who are not gluten intolerant but wheat allergic (different atters entirely). The writer does not discuss the differences between regular wheat, kamut, spelt, rye, oats, and barley.Those in the US will find her list of resources helpful; readers living outside the US will want more information."
5,Did you like Four Weddings and Funeral? You'll love this,So much fun - such a cute movie - watch if you're planning a Bar Mitzvah
2,Very disappointing...,"From the name of the book and the pictures on the cover you'd think this book is about Anabolic Steroids. Unfortunately this book only contains very brief profiles on the most common steroids with about 3 lines of text each. Besides the very short profiles no additional info on steroids and their use is provided.The rest of this rather thin book is a collection of very brief, and to most bodybuilders probably useless, descriptions of common supplements such as creatine and l-carnitine.Most of the references are to websites. Apart from the Internet being a questionable source of information to base a book about supplements and pharmaceuticals on, the majority of these websites do not even exist anymore.Those looking for info on steroids should avoid this book as it contains no info that can not be found in any other steroids book or steroids website. This is definitely not a worthy sequal to Anabolic Primer."
3,An O.K. read,"This was a well written book but i found the lonely planet to be much more detailed. This book is exellent for the upper class traveler, but left the budget travellers without many options.This book told me a lot of things about places to viset and even though i prefer lonely planet i would still recomend it."
4,Very Helpful Guidebook,"My family and I travelled to Costa Rica and took this book with us. I found it to be a wealth of information, especially when it came to choosing a hotel. I also enjoyed reading about the areas of the country we didn't get to visit on this trip. I especially found the selections labelled ""kids"" helpful when planning a vacation with my young children."
4,great,"This book was great. I loved how Elizabeth did that cooking test for Jess and she failed it! The only thing that I absolutley hated is that this book was sooooo different from the university series. The author shouldv'e wrote them in order but instead she wrote the svh, svu books and the rest in a different order. some things she wrote were just not possible. for example, elizabeth saw olivia in SVU, but she already died in svh!! she definitley shouldnt have done that. finish one series, then go on 2 the next!"
1,I don't get it...,"What I don't get is how come Jessica suddenly doesn't want to graduate and Elizabeth can't wait.... It doesn't agree with the plot of SVU #1, where Liz wants everything to be the same (best friends with Enid/Alex, in love with Todd)and Jess wants to 'escape' SVH and her parents rules for collage.... I think the authors have TOTALLY STUFFED UP SWEET VALLEY! And SVU shouldn't have ended........"
4,A good ending to the series,"After 20 years and countless spin-offs, the world of sweet vally is officially coming to a close. This book is a commerative edition with the first edition of SVH ""Double Love"" included at the back of the book. I thought the book was good, Jessica finally expressed her feelings towards Elizabeth about her going to Oxford and the twins and all their friends finally graduate. A few memorable characters from the original SVH series finally make a comeback including Amy, Lila, Bruce, Winston, Todd and Enid who is now a Goth. The one thing I did not enjoy about the SVH Senior Year series was that these characters were left out of the books replaced by new characters. All in all, the book was good, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the SVH series."
5,Twins are turning 18 and graduating,"The Twins are having a birthday,They are turning 18.The party is at The Riot.Jessica doesn't go because she fell asleep.Before one of the Twins can graduate,She can do a Pasta dish.I forgot the name of it. Ken and Maria Celebrate Olivia's death together,so do The Twins,They lost Olivia 1 year ago on their birthday or the day after their birthday."
1,why bother,"senior year was a waste of space and the writing went to juvenile.it begged from the beginning shoot me end me put me outta my misery.you're introduced to all new characters,um like you have a chance to establish a good character repatoire with minimum access after all there were characters from the ""real""sweet valley that never had a chance that you would of loved to develop more.plus the whole SVU thing you knew who would make it so why give a flip about connor or any of the ""newbies"" well francine paschal wanted to end and you could tell..what was so bad with the way it was before?all i can guess is that she was bored and none bothered to read the other books.all i can say is so much possibility and promise it is a shame the death wasn't a justified end.true i may of out grew them but i am glad that my little girl will read the real sweet valley but i thought the whole senior year was an insult to teens and avid readers no wonder you wanted it to end you lost your connection."
2,Great idea - cheap construction,Made of cheap plastic - head has already started cracking. Tripod part is also very cheaply made and doesn't hold even a lightweight digital camera with a lot of stability. How much more would it really cost them to produce this item using higher quality materials?
2,not durable - small and plastic,I went to buy this item at BH in NYC and just by looking at the item you can tell it won't last long. The micro ball head was already not stabilizing my camera and was all plastic.So luckly the sales person at BHphotovideo told me to buy instead the manfrotto table top tripod v3007 + extension for table to tripod and the micro ball head. The material is very durable (made in Italy) and still very compact. I love my new tripod.
5,Cool idea!,"Ordered this for a friend, who's a HUGE camera/photography buff. He loved it as soon as he opened it. Haven't heard too much about it, but from the pics I've seen he's used it for are great!"
2,Good idea but junk quality,"Don't get me wrong. I like this product. After reading an article from the travel section of the news paper, I ordered one from Amazon. I just hate asking strangers for photos. It is a same catagory as asking for a direction. It works really well. Taking photos of my family with me in it. Although, size was little long. Wish it was shorter so that I can put it in my pocket.Unfortunately, as soon as I got the product, tripod leg fell apart. But company sent me a replacement. During our Disneyland trip, after tenth photo, extender fell apart. Company said, they are sending me a replacement but I haven't seen it for a couple of months now.Quality is really bad. As other reviewers stated, it is made of cheap plastics.I wish some quality tripod company come out with their own version (w high quality materials).Well, now it is a broken junk. Wasted $30 for nothing."
1,Not for larger cameras -quick return,"This contraption must be just for mini pocket camera's - very flimsy. I tried to put alarger camera on it and it wouldn't hold it up easily. The little mirror? what mirror? Its really wasn't usable. Tripod legs were nice but the tripod was unstable for larger cameras, Wouldn't balance it. Definitely do not get it if you do not have a camera you can fit in a shirt pocket"
1,BGroker in First Week,"Mine broke in the first week before i could even really use it. THe last 4 inches won't extend, the white piece of plastic that you press to close it... it snapped. I might get the other company's $25 version"
5,Handy gadget!,This item is just what I've been looking for! It will be great when traveling so I can actually be in some of my pictures in far away places. The tripod will also be a help when using the zoom on my camera to avoid blurred pictures. It is small enough to be easy to carry.
3,Works okay but....,"Works okay, but it's it's plastic. Not even heavy duty plastic. So it could cause camera shake problems for heavier compact cameras like my Canon Powershot G9. It would be great if someone came out with a heavy duty pod like this. It comes with a miniature tripod which is also plastic. It's okay for twenty bucks, but I'm looking for something better in the meantime."
4,Why didn't they think of this before?,I sure wish this product came out earlier- would've been perfect for our honeymoon & other trips! This comes in a compact white unmarked box. The QuikPod itself is in a handy black pouch. Not bad...just have to remember this isn't for heavy-duty use. It's an inexpensive travel aide.
2,Sigh,"I saw this advertised on television to work with small cameras and video cameras. I put my small video camera on this unit and the entire unit bows. I have some pretty heavy camcorders, but this ultra-light consumer camcorder is very light and fits within the weight requirements of the unit. The footage I get from it is shaky and unstable.And with the small camera... you have to use your camera timer, which can take up to 15 seconds on some cameras (10 seconds on mine) and you're not entirely certain if your shot came out right (this isn't a product problem, entirely user).My main dissapointment is the video camera discovery. That's $30 down the drain."
1,Broke before I even used it,"I mounted a GoPro, extended, then retracted the pole, and when I tried to extend it again the last locking tab was broken off."
3,Not happy,"It seems to be a great gadget to have around - useful and handy, but it's shorter than I expected it to be. And I never even used the tripod yet and two of its legs already broke from the swivel while I was testing it. It would be fantastic if I could have replacement parts at no cost since it was never even used yet."
2,Inexpensive but not that durable,"Inexpensive and handy but ALL plastic make sit a bit fragile. Even the tripod that come with it in the pictures looks like it is alloy but don't be fooled, it as well is lightweight plastic. I don't have HIGH use demand for this item but if you plan on a world tour or plan on taking pictures on a daily basis with this, opt for the metal version.It actually feels like something you would get from the dollar store more than something you would buy to hold your $300 camera."
5,QuickPod,I like this product. Now if I can figure out where I put it. Before I lost it I tried it out and was happy with it. I'm going to order another one real soon.
2,Not so great QuickPod,"I had QuickPod for about a week for my GoPro and it broke. It is nice to have the extension option but the material it is made out of is such bad plastic that the camera shakes and it makes a weird noise which is in all of your videos. It is good for the buck but if you are planning to use it for heavy duty action shooting, you might want to go with another product"
4,Quikpod Handheld Convertible Tripod,"Highly recommend this item if you wish to be in the picture. The vendor's delivery time was fine, will buy from this vendor again."
3,Not bad - needs a little more heft on the mount system,"This is an O.K. product. Several of the reviews commented on the flimsy mount for the camera - and I have to agree this to be the case. I think with some care it can be made to work for a while without breaking.The other part that is a little difficult is the ""mirror"" just below the mount that allows you to see yourself while taking the photo. This only works with doing some adjustments and requires the assistance of someone else. This is because it's impossible to know if the camera is actually coordinated with the mirror and the lens without looking through the viewfinder or LCD display. It's minor - but it would be nice to have an easier way to set it.Overall, I'm sure I'll use it for its intended purpose for as long as I can."
3,Not Durable,The quick pod pro is a cool device unfortunately it has a serious design flaw. The plastic acrylic piece that the ball swivel is in is not durable. I used my quickpro only a handful of times and I could already see the crack forming where u tighten the nob to hold the camera in position. I tried to glue it but that didn't work and it is broken and useless now. I may try some JB weld on it. The piece is completely removable and if Quickpod sold replacement pieces it wouldn't be such a big deal. I am sure I'm not the only person to have it break on me so be warned. It is still a really cool gadget though. I hate asking strangers to take my picture. Good luck!
2,"Another vote for ""Good idea, poor design""","The QuickPod is a terrific concept, but the costruction of the actual product is exceedingly poor. It's made of some very brittle plastic that cracked the moment I attached it to my camera. I threw the QuickPod away and bought a steel Xshot($10 cheaper) to replace it."
4,All the features for a great price,"We wanted a unit for our kitchen that would allow us to connect an ipod. This absolutely fit the bill, and I recommend it if youre looking to not spend a lot of money, but get something of value.Cons:1. Sound quality is what you would expect for this price range. If you're not an audiophile, you'll definitely be happy with it. But it could do with better high and low range response. Its not bad though.2. The design - I think the dock should have been better integrated. Plus the speakers aren't connected to the main unit, so there are wires hanging out in the back. Tack on the ipod dock and yovue got one more wire.Pros:1. The remote controls the ipod when its in the doc. I wasn't expecting that feature.2. Fits both our ipod original, and ipod nano easily.3. Easy to use4. There is an audio in (headphone like) connection in the front of the unit, in case you dont use an ipod but have some other MP3 player or external source to connect."
1,Only one speaker worked,"This was a gift for my 11-yr-old niece for Christmas. However, only one speaker worked. The other had terrible static. Also the writeup on Amazon mentioned a cassette player, but the machine would not play cassettes. I returned it and hope to see the credit on my next credit card bill."
5,speedy,i love these condoms always have and always will. very dependable and shipped fast! looking forward to using them over the weekend.
4,I personally didn't notice a big difference between ...,"I personally didn't notice a big difference between these and the condoms I regularly use, but my significant other did. I trust the Trojan name, and since my partner seems to prefer these to the ones we were using, these will most likely become our regular brand. They were thinner than the ones I usually use but they worked well, so I have no concerns about them."
3,The Trojan Ultra Pleasure Spermicidal Lubricated Latex Condoms ...,"The Trojan Ultra Pleasure Spermicidal Lubricated Latex Condoms were okay. They're lubricated, so that's good. I wouldn't say they added any extra pleasure. I prefer the thin condoms that Trojan makes to these Ultra Pleasure condoms. These caused almost a burning sensation, whereas the thin condoms feel normal."
2,"Good idea, Poor execution.","Some well written chapters, some horribly written chapters. This book is mixed bag. The Editors needed to pay closer attention to the formatting (sloppy errors) and they needed to coach certain authors into getting their ideas out on paper with greater clarity. The ""dummies"" format just does not cut it with me. Just give us clean paragraphs and chapters. No fluff needed.This book may frustrate and disappoint the more advanced reader in eschatology, and it may just plain confuse someone new to the area of study. I say walk before you run with the speculative ideas. Beginners would be better off starting elsewhere.If you can't get enough of prophecy studies, go ahead and buy it. But for beginners, let me recommend a book as a substitute, which is similar, as far as being a grand overview: On Prophecy, by J. Vernon Mcgee. This is a great, and thoroughly Biblical overview which even the initiated will find useful."
4,Living in the Woods and Eating bugs,"I love this Album. Sure its not the best cd ever but its entertaining to listen to, and its a lot of carni noise =] individual and unique"
4,Shockingly Circus-like,"One of the most original sounds I've heard for years. They could seriously be performers in a circus. I wish I could find this album somewhere other than just on amazon. Spread the word, They Shoot Horses Don't They is one of the best new bands out there."
3,"From me, For you","well, across the world i have seen many different decks of tarot cards, i must say, this is the first and perhaps only deck that is so mini in size and its by Waite himself that i have seen in the market. i bought it for a simple reason: i wanted a display of tarot cards but hey, i cant get the usual sized ones right? then they'll probably take up the whole wall. i found this deck and thought that it'll make a perfect display of the tarot deck itself, each and every single designed card. the plus point of this tiny deck is that, it still tags along with it faithfully, as ever, its own paper-folded tarot information and readings. an amazingly cute buy and useful too."
5,Neat gift,"This is a great gift for any student of the Tarot to take with them everywhere and be able to study their cards. It can be used for readings, but it is very difficult to shuffle the tiny cards. It also makes a unique stocking-stuffer for anyone who's interested in the Tarot. Makes a great collector's item for those who collect decks as well. It's the standard, basic Rider-Waite Tarot deck."
2,Good for study purposes,"When I first opened the box after purchasing these cards, my first reaction was disappointment. As mentioned so many times before, the size is just not practical for a Tarot deck. The print on these cards is not very good at all, the images are very pixellated. Sure they are small cards, but for a retail venture I would expect better quality print.I did find one good use for these cards, they are good to use while studying and learning the Tarot. They can be taken places that might be difficult to take a full size deck, or you can tape them inside the pages of your Tarot study notebook for quick reference of the card image.I understand the draw to smaller size Tarot cards, but if you want a deck that you can actually use for reading, look elsewhere. These are just too tiny."
2,Cute but entirely impractical,"I'm new to tarot, and while I own and deeply love my World Spirit deck (based on Rider-Waite), the cards are a little large, so I thought it would be fun to get this tiny, portable set. Alas, the very first day I had it on my keychain, the clasp of the holder caught on my car door as I was getting out and cards spilled *everywhere*. Since it's difficult to squish all 78 cards into the little box in the first place, imagine the explosion. I did the best I could, but was still missing three cards after several minutes of searching. When I got home, I actually found another card on my couch, where I hadn't even noticed it fall the night before.Long, sad story short -- cards are cute enough, but way too easy to lose to really be useful as a portable deck."
3,Nice deck,Wonderful deck BUT... BUT... everyone talks of the holder or keychain or anything else.... it is JUST A DECK.... wonderful deck but just the box... no keychain... no anything... but deck.... BUT wonderful deck. Low rating only due to fans....
2,Tarot disappointment,I received my order and liked the cards very much until I found that 3 cards were missing and 3 different cards were duplicates. I purchased 2 sets and both were identical. Anyone who buys these will get the same thing as I did. Check your cards.
2,printing isn't great,"The size is really cute, but what I don't like about this deck is that the printing isn't clear. Instead of tiny clear sharp images, you get fuzzy, blurry ones, because you can see each individual pixel. It actually looks like bad Sunday comics printing.If you're trying to decide between the tiny and miniature sizes, I would strongly recommend the miniature. That's what I wish I'd gotten."
5,Tiny Universal Waite is a wonderful tool!,"This tiny cutie is a powerhouse! Put in a low bowl and choose one in the morning to see what the day holds; and/or ask a question, choose card,and meditate on the answer. Carry one or two as talisman to manifest your wishes. A major combine with a minor is excellent for this. So many possibilities...use your imagination. I absolutely love these."
1,This Product Was Of Blue Quality,"I bought this product, when it was shipped to me the product was of poort quality. 2 or 3 swords sheaths were busted and the swords were all scratched or stained, and all 3 sheaths looked like they have been altered. I am very dissapointed."
5,LA MEJOR!,ESTE CD PROMETE MUCHO EN LA CARRERA DE ESTA CANTANTE EXTRAURDINARIA. SE PUEDE APRECIAR LA CALIDEZ DE LOS ARREGLOS Y LA MADUREZ DE SU VOZ. DEFINITIVAMENTE ESTE SERA EL MEJOR YEAR DE PAULINA.
5,Outstanding and highly reccomended,The first chapter (Why People Read Fiction) is worth the price of the book alone. Some reviewers have nitpicked a few typos and repetition. Having taught eye surgery for 45 years and having written a textbook on eye surgery - I can say with confidence that repetition lies at the heart of teaching typos not withstanding.Be that as it may - the aspiring writer will find much of value within these pages.
5,C'est Magnifique,"This is, without doubt, one of the finest piano recordings ever made. It deserves a special award for Paul Jacobs' magnificent playing on a fabulous Bosendorfer Imperial grand piano and for the excellence of the warm, spacious, brilliant recorded sound. As they say, this release exhausts superlatives. Jacobs' performances are justly esteemed for their insights into this color-drenched, sybaritic music; he judges each timbre and each accent magically, putting his playing beyond almost all of the others (Gieserking, Zimmerman, et al.). Just listen to ""Footprints in the Snow,"" ""On the terrace of Moonlight,"" ""La puerto del vino,"" ""The Fairies Dance Exquisitely,"" and ""Fireworks,"" etc., etc. for an example of transcendental pianism. Exquisite, indeed. Lovely! And virtuosic, as in the last Prelude of Book 2, ""Fireworks."" If you don't own this release, you'd better snap up your copy before you're reduced to having to burn a scatchy library copy."
5,boss!!,If Voiles doesn't get your goat and La Danse de Puck doesn't make you chuckle a little and Canope doesn't fill you with wonder at the amazing beauty of debussy harmony then....i don't know what.Paul Jacobs rules.
1,I wish I knew,"It is now almost two months since I ordered this product and it has not yet arrived. I heard nothing from the company until over six weeks had passed, and then only through prodding through Amazon. I can't review what I don't have."
3,Friends For The Journey,"Although it didn't hold my attention very long, it is a very poingant journey through a friendship. They are both good writers and I've read better works by each of them."
4,Great for working out the knots.,This is great for doing it on yourself and the large muscle groups. I would also advise probably purchasing the small travel one as well for portability.
4,Works in all those out-of-the-way places.,"Foam rollers have their limitations. Massages cost a lot. This stick bridges much of those gaps.My only caveat, about the whole Stick series, is that none of them are capable of a truly deep-tissue athletic style massage. This is not exactly a surprise, but, just fyi."
5,big stick = big relief,great product to help muscles recover after heavy lifting or as a warm up before lifting weights
2,Bach against the Wall,"Love Dave Brubeck, saw a terrif documentary, delighted in his kids' inheritance of musical talent ... so not only ordered this disk for myself but also for a niece for the holidays. Should have listened to it first before buying it as gift. There are 2 Bach-inspired pieces (or so), but the rest of this disk sounds like big band music. Kinda embarrassing."
5,Great Start!,I am an American/Polish woman who married an Indian man in a Hindu ceremony. This book was a great explanation of the multiple ceremonial parts. Over the last year I went to three Hindu weddings and read the book in between. By the third wedding I was explaining the ceremonies to other American guests and even to my ex-FOB fiance.
1,A Bit too Mystical and Patronizing,"This book claims to be ""practical"", but I'm afraid it isn't very. Instead, it's full of self-indulgent fluff.Ms. Reed sets the tone in chapter 1: ""Sources: Where I Think Fiction Comes From"". True to its title, the chapter is mostly a bunch of personal opinion--generally vague, mystical ones like, ""Be willing to bring everything you know and are to the typewriter"". The only truly useful point in the chapter is also an obvious point: fiction comes from the writer's experiences.The book also contains some useful information about writing. But the useful information is all fairly obvious: either inane observations or else the same suggestions you will find in a hundred other books on writing. Nothing that really makes it worth plunging through the ""I thinks"" and the personal anecdotes--unless you are as fascinated with Kit Reed as Kit Reed seems to be."
2,Not worth it,"I can't believe all the good reviews these got! I have straight, long hair, and these things just made them sloppily kinky--sometimes if I screw around with my hair long enough and I can play it off as a ""messy curl"", but I finally quit trying to make these look good. If you want a decent curl that will stay in longer and look neater, get hot rollers. These just disappointed me. They might work better on thinner hair... my hair's super thick, so if you're more in my boat I'd invest in some rollers (Remington's are great). But I have yet to take these out of my hair and be impressed or even happy with the results."
4,very good protable device,"It comes in handy on long trips, helpful at meetings and great for saving pictures and documents on. It's small and compact that I carry it in my pocket its also light so when you hang it around your neck it does not bother. Iam happy with this purchase. It's also a great gift."
3,You get what you pay for,"The 512MB Coby is the 4th player I've had to buy in as many years. The LED lights up well enough, the sound is ok for the price range of this player, and it connects and syncs well with USB on PCs and Windows media.The big downside is that it uses up the juice on the single AAA battery within a matter of a couple of hours. If you use your mp3 player often, say at work on a daily basis, prepare to spend a lot on batteries. No other mp3 player I've ever used has sucked up battery juice as quickly as this Coby unit. The other downside is that there is a delay in using the small 4 sided switch control. Changing the volume or moving between music tracks can be frustrating, as it takes a few seconds for the unit to activate each time you push the forward or backward controls.Ultimately, this is a so-so player. It has some nice features and is good enough for an entry level player. But if you're an experienced I-podder, you can do a lot better with a higher end purchase."
4,A First Reference Book,"This book is my initial statistics reference book. I find it easy to use to find information. It does not give you so much information you cannot use it. The examples and equations are helpful as is the Text and Software reference section in the back. I expect to use one or more of the software and/or book coupons that are offered in the Appendix section of the book.The software is helpful but a bit cumbersome to unload and set up. But, the programs are simple to use which is a big plus. Also, having the data for most examples already loaded sure saves time. All in all a good reference to keep in my office library."
4,Best Moments of the Amazing Kreskin,I have always like watching the Amazing Kreskin every week when it used to be on TV ....now that they are DVD I am very satisfied with the episodes that were selected....
2,boys like guns,"I bought this gun for my two boys and my nephew. When I opened the box some of the detailing on the guns was broken off/ and or bend to the side and on one gun the screw holding the metal clip was stripped. So my husband had to rescrew and glue a new screw in. Boys like guns, overall they are having fun with the toy but I don't believe they will last very long. We buy all kinds of toys like this and some of the replicated ones are better than ones marked as ""toys""."
3,"Not a review, but a question","I heard a bit of ocean games in a commerical in venezuela, and it listed the artist as St.Germain cafe. (I think it did, it was in spanish after all) Anyway my question is to anyone who already has this CD, Could you tell me who made ocean games? I'm trying to see if this the same song I'm thinking, so I'm gonna try searching for the artist. Pleae email me at grey_fox24@yahoo.com if you know."
4,Himalayan Adventure,"This is a lovely book which beautifully describes an extensive trek in a remote area of the Himalayas. Ms. Kincaid and her close friend, Dan Hinckley, a distinguised botanist, make the trip together. Dan Hinckley has traveled in the region extensively. It is the author's first Himalayan trek and she trains diligently to be prepared for its rigors. The author is a gifted writer who describes the feelings and emotions triggered by the beauty of the region and its warm and hospitable people. Ms. Kincaid's style is most engaging and includes wonderful description, humor, and great senstivity. The focus of the trek is the collection of seeds for propagating Himalayan plantlife in North America. The passion of the participants for gathering the seeds of rare species is engaging to gardeners and non-gardeners alike. All who have journeyed to this special part of the world, or intend to, will enjoy this charming book."
1,Terrible Odor,"The smell of this condom is overpowering. I decided to try something different, my regular brand is Lifestyles Natural Feeling. The fit was ok, the ring at the base was larger than I'm used to, but didn't affect much. This condom would be ok if the odor wasn't so disgusting."
1,not original at all,Very disappointed in the quality or lack of in this book. The author uses more quotes from other books than he does his own thoughts. The author focuses too much on seriously out-dated information. Easiest course I ever took because book provided no challenges.
2,an extra star for all the guest artists,"The title of this album is an oxymoron. Or a sick joke. I can't decide. Sure he has made millions by luring the uninitiated listener into his web of deceit and conceit, but don't be fooled any longer. How fortunate Hampson has been to sing for and with great artists to shoulder his heavy load."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"This is a good book if you are a novice trader. If you know anything about the market and how it works look into some other books. ""How to make money in stocks"" is a lot better."
5,"Great Book, too !","Author Andy Dunn outlines his systematic approach to investing in a format that will appeal to both the novice and the advanced. Those familiar with Dunn's writing will be pleased to see that none his trademark wit and obsession with detail have been left out. Rather than give advice based on subjective opinions, Dunn removes the guesswork by providing a strategy based on facts and hard data. The reader can take charge of his investments by learning what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell, all at their own comfort level.Tired of advice that might have been great last year ? Take charge ! I highly recommend this book."
5,A technique guide for investors,"Andy Dunn is a successful investor, as well as a professional stock and commodies futures trader who expertly distills what he knows into the pages of Great Companies, Great Charts: Effective Stock Trading Techniques To Beat The Markets. Instructing the lay reader in how to scan for the best stocks, enter trades with buy shops, exit trades with sell shops, reduce risk with portfolio allocation, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a short time frame vs. a long one, and much more, Great Companies, Great Charts is a first-class primer and technique guide for investors of all experience levels with the market. Dunn's no-nonsense writing style does not obscure technical matters but presents them in terms that readers of all backgrounds can readily grasp."
3,"Good principles, too much vulgarity","This shortish book contains a lot of sound information that other books don't put so clearly or concisely. One refreshing aspect of it is that the author goes through the history of foolish trading mistakes he made when he was more nave about the market and about business in general. Beginning and somewhat more experienced traders would do very well to examine and adopt some of the author's trading principles.The book is marred by the author's occasional vulgarity, including repeated references to getting so excited that he urinates in his ""frilly panties"", which I guess are meant to be funny but instead come under the category of ""you have to know the guy"". It's obnoxious, but inexperienced writers aren't always aware of how their language will be perceived by the reader.So, if you want some solid, workable trading principles, and enjoy or are at least willing to forgive this author's pre-adolescent potty humor, this is a good book to read."
2,Wish I could return it,"I am realtively new to vegetarianism and even I didn't find the book particularly helpful.I agree with others who said it was too general, too much about pregnancy and not enough about VEGETARIANISM during pregnancy.I wish I had realized this earlier and was able to return it; cannot even give it to Goodwill or sell it at Half-Price books since it's the Kindle Edition (which might make it even more confusing to try to read?!. It was not cheap either...Such a waste of money!"
2,Not as good as I expected,"This entire book is in Question & Answer format, which I find rather annoying. It was written by an obstetrician, and contains far too much general info about pregnancy. I have other books for that; I was expecting only information about nutrition from this book. The actual information and tables related to nutrition are the best part of this book, but comprise far too few pages relative to the whole thing."
3,"She really, really means well, but...","The title just doesn't quite represent the book. It is a very nice book about generally staying healthy during pregnancy, or exploring the idea of vegetarianism, but as a lifelong vegetarian looking for some real in-depth information, I was disappointed. It's very beginner-level.One glaring omission: absolutely no mention of Dr. Tom Brewer, or his dietary recommendations/discoveries! Not even in her section on toxemia/preeclampsia! There's a quick mention of the theory that calcium may help prevent these problems, but no mention at all of the incredible success of Dr.Brewer's advice: Lots of protein, plenty of water, and salt-to-taste. (and, of course, plenty of veggies and whole grains...) Check out blueribbonbaby.org."
3,okay book,I didn't really like it and didn't find it helpful. Maybe if you're new to vegetarianism and scared it might reassure you. Being a pregnant vegetarian is no different than being a pregnant meat eater. Just eat healthy foods and you're good to go.
2,Not really useful.,"It really didn't help. I have other pregnancy books that weren't veggie, that gave the same information."
2,terribly difficult to find what you are looking for,"I really did not like this book. I donated it to Goodwill already. There is no sense (at least that I can see) for the way the book is laid out and I think the way the author counts pregnancy is weird...most people count weeks 1-4 as month one, even though you do not know you are pregnant yet. She counts it as month zero. Although this is valid, it is not the way any other book I own counts pregnancy, so it is too confusing for me.The book gets two stars for its nutritional information. I cannot see how this information can be easily used by many who are not RDs, but it is cool to look at. Maybe it would be helpful if you have worried family members, but I kind of doubt it...you could really only make them feel better about protein.I would not buy this book again, obviously, since I got rid of it!"
2,Not what I expected,Years ago a friend showed us a tai chi with flowing moves - not single moves but a continuous movement. Wish I could find that again as it definitely did help with balance
4,Great,This is a no thrills DVD but it is great for people with mobility problems. I have never done Tai Chi before what liked is that there is no floor as getting up off the floor is difficult.
3,Scott Cole: Discover Tai Chi for balance and Mobility,I am sure this is probably excellent for someone who is not able to stand well etc. For me I like his other CD's better
4,Good beginner CD,This is a good CD to introduce older people to basic Tai Chi exercises. The Chair assisted routines are especially good if you are worried about balance.
5,For my dad,"My dad has a serious balance problem falling over at any time hopefully this will hep with this problem, quick service."
5,Well done and helpful,This tai chi video is excellent for older adults and people with balance problems. It is very well done.
5,Exactly as advertised,"Effective 32 minute concoction of stretching, yoga, qigong and a smidge of tai chi. Effective to the point that if I miss a day I feel the difference.Claire, hope you are still out there."
3,Too Much Chit Chat,Too much chit chat and not enough Tai Chi. I expected to be guided through a total short Tai Chi form.
5,Wonderful for us seniors,"This video delivers on it's promises! We are 71 and have suffered the usual joint pain and stiffness as well as back discomfort. Since we started doing doing the exercises on this video we both are much more flexible, our joint pain and back discomfort are greatly reduced. We look forward to even more improvement in the future. I would highly recommend this for not just seniors but anyone with joint problems, stiffness and soreness. Of course consult your health professional first. We did and got his enthusiastic go ahead!"
3,Tai Chi with Scott Cole,Much too easy. Good for relaxation I suppose but was not impressed. I may give this to my 83 year old mother. She would have no problem using this DVD.
2,Just a little Tai Chi,"There are some very nice relaxing moves, but you don't learn the classic 24 forms. I am a beginner, but want to learn more forms and how to connect them."
5,Great DVD!,"I bought this dvd several months ago and am surprised it isn't worn out. If it should get damaged in any way, will replace it immediately.Scott keeps the movements on the slow side and gives excellent verbal instructions making it very easy to follow. I am 73 yrs old and feel my upper body has benefitted greatly from this dvd in the way of flexibility and strength; think it even helped with my golf swing.I have to confess that I have only been doing the standing portion of the dvd because it lasts about 15 minutes and can easily fit that in to my schedule almost every morning, whereas if I had to commit myself to a half hour for the complete exercise, would probably avoid it altogether.Seniors, in particular, should love this."
2,"You won't ""Discover Tai Chi""","This video does not teach Tai Chi. I wish I'd read the description more carefully. It's just a half-hour exercise that uses some Tai Chi moves. Fine for what it is, but I was misled by the name.If you want to learn Tai Chi, check outBodyWisdom Media: Tai Chi for Beginners."
3,More elementary than expected.,This was helpful and got me moving. I would have liked some help in posing other than demonstration. The moves were helpful in improving my balance.
5,A Worthy Upgrade,"I have a Sony DSC-N1 digital camera with a Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo 1GB card, which has worked well, but I wanted something with more capacity for an upcoming trip. I bought this Ultra II 4GB card and I couldn't be happier. The camera is noticeably faster taking photos. The upgrade in speed is even more noticeable when I hook up the camera to my PC to download the photos. The percentage increase in speed is tough to gauge over the previous card, but I'd guess it to be as much as 50% in some cases (which makes sense when you consider the specified read/write speed). I reckon I can put between 1100 and 1200 photos on the card at full 8MP resolution. This is more than enough for any trip. I also have other Sandisk products and they've all been excellent (and great value). If you're looking for a 4GB Ultra II Memory Stick I'm sure you'll be very happy with this product."
5,Worth The Money!,This is my second 4gb memory stick and I plan on getting another one soon. I never had a problem with SanDisk.
4,Nice card but too expensive,This is a nice card and all with amazing write speeds and some really good storage especialy onsidering its size. But this thing is just way to dang expensive. For the same price I can get 4x SanDisk 2 Gigabyte cards total 8 gigabytes. Although you have to give this card credit for having a lot of space in one card I just cant get myself to buy knowing I can get DOUBLE the space for the exact same price.
5,Uhh...,"Why is everyone rating this product a ""1"" just because Amazon screwed up your order?? Your rating has nothing to do with the product itself and makes the product look bad.Maybe I should rate this product a ""1"" because Amazon ran out of my body wash..."
3,It works but it is rather slow,"This drive works, but it is not faster than my smaller (512 MB) Memory Stick Pro Duo, which is not Ultra II, but just Ultra. I was counting on Ultra II, to mean something better, but apparently this is not true."
1,How sad!,"I too was in that position. I saw the link yesterday and made the decision today to pre-order yet lo and behold, the item is removed without cause.I specifically checked the pre-order webpage for an offer expiry date or something and found nothing.How unfortunate. I'm saving this entire webpage right now in case they try to make this disappear too. We should consider legal action..."
1,What the heck?,"Since when can a company advertise a price, sell something, and then decide against selling it at the price advertised?If no one else is going to do it, I know I can help mobilize anyone in the psp community who ordered one of these and got cancelled without notification.Contact me at psingley ( a t ) gmail (dot) com if you're interested in persuing this, im going to see if customer service has any recourse for me."
4,I too had my order cancled without notice!,"In my business if I make a mistake I eat it and move on. I don't actually expect you all to do that, but I would like some acknowledgement that something happend and my order was cancled. I had to actually go look at my order to find out it was no longer. I know I am not the only one! Pleas look into this!"
1,So the rules don't apply to Amazon?,"I'm sure the product is great, but this review is more for the company... Like everyone else, my order got cancelled. Why? Because they messed up! People called to confirm the price and they said it was correct. If something is mis-marked in a retail store, you get it for the price it's listed at! So why doesn't that law apply to Amazon.com?"
1,Thanks for not notifying me that my order was canceled,It's good to see that customer service is Amazon's top priority.
3,Abridged version,"I was disappointed with this product (although I have had occasion to use similar versions of other texts before and I'm sure it is excellent) because I had not realised that I had purchased an abridged version - and I needed the whole unabridged book.As it was a very slim volume and I had opened the parcel (it was loose and packed with another book), I decided not to attempt to return it (it may be useful, in the future, for a student who is struggling). I have been able to obtain another copy locally."
4,Good product,I needed something to clean my suede shoes and I took a chance on this. It's simply an eraser and a soft-bristled brush but it works great! It will get out the usual grit and grime and it will spruce up the nap. Good product.
4,Works well but isn't perfect.,"I purchased this suede cleaning kit for my off-white suede shoes that had become pretty dirty. I was specifically looking to remove some water spots that had formed on them.I had read reviews saying that these kinds of kits don't really work, but they do! However, you can't expect perfection out of them.I found that with enough work using the eraser, you can get the spots and dirt to go away to the point where it is unnoticable. Some disappeared completely. Be careful though - the eraser causes a lot of dust!If you have some dirty shoes, I recommend getting this kit. It's not a miracle in a package, but it gets the job done.And as a side note, I don't recommend using vinegar to get spots out. No matter what those online guides say, it just made my problem worse."
4,New Nubucks,"I had a very nice pair of black nubuck clogs, Through wear, they got water and soil spots on them, I looked for products in local stores to clean them, without success. I went on-line to amazon and found this product. I received it promptly and used it once, Now my shoes are clean and looking very chic!!"
2,Flimsy Roaster with dangerous rack,"After using this pan for a while, I have decided to get a different one, perhaps one I can see and feel before I buy it. The rack in this roasting pan has collapsable handles which are hard to grab since the pan's handles are in the way. I have burned myself repeatedly even using a potholder since grabbing the rack handle leaves the back of the hand exposed to the pan's fixed handles. Probably designed by someone who does not cook much.The pan's bottom is pretty flimsy and does not sit flat so that making gravy in the pan is almost impossible. It does not contact the cooktop since there is a sort of ridge around the edge which prevents the heating element from doing its job.Pretty to look at though, and if you only use it once a year for a Turkey, I suppose it might do. But for the price I paid, and the Analon name, I expected something better."
4,worked great for ham and turkey,"this thing is heavy but that isn't so much of a problem because it is also heavy-duty. i don't remember the weight of the turkey i was able to put into it, but i know it does a ham roast really well. it's big, and willing to work hard. it's hard to clean but all things made of steel usually are. nice product."
1,shorted out in less than 3 years,Orig equip in new house. This thing shorted out in less than 3 years. The good news is it wasn't a silent failure.
5,I didn't believe it!,"Reading the first review, I was unsure if it was real or not. Trust me, I'm a real person with no association to Jafrum or Amazon (except as a customer). This is a good quality bag! Plenty of pockets on it to put cells phones etc. and the inside is roomier than the dimensions listed would leave you to believe. Two bottom Velcro straps wrap around your sissy bar. That means it will fit around just about any sissy bar. I have a Honda VTX 1300 with a stock sissy bar on the back and it seems good and tight to me. I've owned it just a week or so but my initial impression is to recommend you to buy it. It's all leather with no nylon liners or anything. I like the way it looks on my bike. Oh, by the way, doing business with Amazon and Jafrum was a pleasure. I ordered it Columbus Day and had it Tuesday after work. One day! Wow! I won't hesitate to use Jafrum in the future."
5,Money well spent,"I just recieved this bag today. This is money well spent. Put in on the back of my 1200 Sportster Custom. It is on the passenger part of the seat and it is attached to the sissy bar. There are so many different ways to attach this that there is no way that it can come off while riding. Looks great on a Sportster, the size is just right. I bet this bag would look good on any V-Twin Cruiser. Lots of room inside and there are a few small pockets for smaller things. Good quality leather. I say ""Go for it""."
5,Surprises in PA,I wanted to find some close places to take my family. This book provides some great ideas about places in my home state I had never thought about. We have a trip to Coudersport planned. The book is well written and easy to use. I've given it to several friends who also enjoyed using it.
3,The picture is different form the actual product,"Just for the heads up, the actual item is a pack of 12 metal files with no handle. I'm not sure if it's a sapphire coat or not but it did look and feel different from the Sapphire Nail File I have.I bought it and returned it with no hassle . All 3 stars to the customer service. They're very resourceful and the refund process was quick.So if you just want to replace your old metal files, this might be the one you're looking for. But if you're specifically looking for a Sapphire Coat file, I'm not positive that this is it. However, you can always return the product with the full refund."
2,"look nice, not practical","This was our pattern for our everyday china when we got married. While these salt and pepper shakers look beautiful on the table with all the other pieces, when it comes time to actually salt or pepper your meal, you need to be patient. It will take FOREVER to get enough salt on your dish, as you'll be shaking for a while. My husband wishes he could drill another hole or two on the top. Maybe it's an attempt to get us Americans to use less salt in our food....these are pretty to look at, just not so easy to use."
5,Good starter kit,"Good variety of items to get started with. I used playtex vent air with my 1st child, but my 2nd child had a lot of gas, so I tried these. It didn't eliminate all of my baby's discomfort, but it reduced the gas considerably. The bottle cleaning brush is the best one I've owned, and would recommend buying it even if you don't buy the bottles. The little pipe cleaner brushes are also good to clean the spill proof valves from my toddler's sippy cups(playtex)! The tote bag & ice pack keep the bottles cold, but I add an extra ice pack to keep them colder longer. This is a good starter kit and I would recommend buying a 3 pack of 8oz bottles to go with it."
4,Nice Watch,"Initialy, it took a bit to work through the setting and it is a smaller case than I expected for a mens watch. However, this is a very sturdy watch. It is perfect for what is is intended for as a solid sports watch. Good buy."
1,Total disappointment,"Who in their right mind puts gloves inside of mittens. It's not like you can take the mittens off and have finger dexterity with the gloves. Item was a TOTAL bust. Other items like this LIST GLOVE LINING in the title - this company buried it in the fine print. If you like gloves inside of mittens then this is your product. Otherwise, I would recommend you look elsewhere. BEWARE - THESE ARE GLOVES PEOPLE."
3,Mitts with fingers,I thought this was a mitt but it's liner was fingered like a glove! Not exactly what I wanted but good price.
2,Not true to size.,The sizes are smaller than they state. The inside is a glove not a liner for the mitten so your fingers still get cold. They used to make these mittens with a fake fleece lining and your fingers never got cold because they were not separated like a glove and the warmth stayed trapped in the mitten. These are a big disappointment
5,These guys are great,This group has some real talent. I went to see them for the 1st time in Rochester NY (free concert) Im officially hooked. Im sure I ll be paying in the future.Nicci
4,Listenable album,"This is quite a decent album, for a group that is for the most part, unknown. Friends often hear it playing and often ask what it is."
3,very relaxing,"Basically, this is a peaceful, instrumental CD mixing classical strings with Indian musical textures (eg. sitar). The songs are very steady-state....not many musical events happening, but still pleasant to listen to. Not quite ambient or New Age, but getting there.I'm sure that if I was in the boat on the cover, in that setting, it would be even better......"
2,Fair sound,"These speakers sound so, so. they are a bit harsh sounding in the upper mid and highs and defintly lacking in the low end. Although the price was reasonable. They have been in service for about 3 months and seem to be holding up. I cant honestly say I am pleased with them because of the poor sound quality."
3,ON ANY SUNDAY II,was as good as the first time I watched it the comparison would be with the original ON ANY SUNDAY which has never been surpased by any other motorcycle movie
3,On any Sunday 2 review,"If you like bikes, you'll like this; however, if you have On Any Sunday, forget this. The 1st one is better...Roy"
2,Password / Code Protected!!,This product was dissappointing as it could not be viewed - the product required a pass word to play which was not available not presumably could not be provided. Sad as the original version was good to watch - take care.
1,On Any Sunday II,"A poor second after the original, ""On Any Sunday"" by Bruce Brown. I'm glad I rented this first rather buying it."
3,On Any Sunday II,"If you liked On Any Sunday original you will probably be a little disappointed by the sequel. The title was obtained I suppose from Bruce Brown, but it turns out it is not a Bruce Brown production. Still lots of good M/C riding but it lacks the Brown style. A good watch for M/C buffs if you get it at a deep discount!"
3,Dog car safety harness,I love not having to fumble with threading the car seat belt through a loop. Just snap the harness attachment into the seat belt thingy! The biggest problem I have with this and any other harness is spending 15 minutes figuring out how it goes on the dog.
1,Awful,"Usually when a CD is marketed with 'Various Artists', a person can tell the difference between the artists that are singing on the CD. Not so with this one. Beyonce Knowles is a fantastic vocalist, and she deserves more than this ""tribute"", which sounds more like a karaoke CD - and a bad one at that. Other tribute CDs will also change up the songs a little - add a twist - but there is nothing original here. I must agree with the other reviewers - I didn't want to give it one star, and I wouldn't take it if it were free."
3,BABY PLEAZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am not the biggest Beyonce fan in the world by any means,but, I think the girl should sue all the various crapy ""artist"" that worked on this tribute ablum. Who are those losers, and why are not not ashamed of their singing voices. They say it's differnt ""artist"" but sound like the same nontalent to me. So what's this album about just some nontalented chick or chicks tryin to capitalize off of Beyonce's success. Take this crap off the market, I would not take it if it were free."
1,WHAT THE H E DOUBLE HOCKEY STIX?!?!,"I dunno what the hell that was i was listening to...she's not american is she? One of them songs sounded like it. EWWW. I agree, i wouldn't buy it if it was free either. I'd run over it with a steamroller twice if i made the mistake of doing so though. If you're gonna tribute a cd to someone PUH*LEEZ know how to SING!!! She should be shame for putting that on that garbage on the market. It's horrible and i hate it. I didn't want to put any star at all."
4,"Fast, cheap, and adequate","This is the book you get when you are moving from user to power user. I bought this book when I was temping and learned vba fast and well enough to get my next assignment. It lead me to more in depth books but this one guided me enough to give me a taste. Within in a couple of chapters your got some cool stuff running. It even shows you how you can make Excel talk to Word. These ""in 24 Hour"" books serve to get you there fast and not to be an in depth book for the subject so it served its purpose. It could use more screen shots for the absolute beginner."
3,VERY COOL,"This epic tale is actually a prequel to the Record of Lodoss War series. The artwork is superbly detailed and wonderful, with intense detail, especially in the costuming and creatures.Unlike most fantasy novels, Lady of Pharis doesn't fool you with cheesy names and plots, but sticks with a pretty simple plot with fairly straightforward characters.This is a great one for CONAN fans."
2,Question......,"At the risk of being non PC (although isn't that what Troma are all about?), I have to ask.....is Toby Radloff mentally retarded or just the worst actor in the history of television & cinema?Personally, I hope it's the former, because he does seem like a nice guy.Seriously though, if you know a tree that can talk then it'll be less wooden than poor old Toby, the self confessed 'nerd'. Even the robot in the original series of Lost In Space acts with more personality & feeling than him!"
4,Great Information but with a high price!,"After recently visiting Biltmore, I was curious about how it all began, relating to the ideas of construction and architecture. I enjoyed this book immensely, but finished it in about 2 hours. [In relation to theprice], this is expensive reading."
2,The Ideas in this Book Can Fit on a Matchbook Cover,"Here's the point of the book: in business meetings and hallway conversations, skip the data-laden PowerPoint slides and tell a story that brings your idea to life. You'll be surprised at how few people do this well, and further surprised at how effective and memorable it is.I wish the author could follow his own advice--he took a boring subject like his personal experiences with KM and made it truly excruciating to read."
2,ponderous,"I found Denning's book ponderous and self-indulgent. The central idea is fine, and the Appendices (17 pages total) have some excellent material. However, this would have been better presented as a 30-page handbook with the Appendices - not a rambling 196-page narrative that violates many of Denning's own story-telling rules. Heath & Heath's fine book, ""Made to Stick"", gives this book inexplicably effusive praise. Perhaps H&H read only the Appendices..."
2,"Some value, but the writing style makes this a boring read","Storytelling is an effective way to communicate ideas and gain buy-in, but the story has to be compelling enough to capture and hold attention. This book fails to capture and hold your attention because the author's writing style makes his story of discovering the positive impact of storytelling uninteresting.There are some positives in the book. If you are involved in knowledge management, you may be able to follow the story a little better. Also, the appendix tells you the essential elements of a springboard story and takes stories in the book and dissects them into those elements. Finally, the book touches both on crafting the story and delivering the story, though neither is treated with a lot of depth.If you already have experience with storytelling and want a reference on how to apply to business, this book could be useful. However, I would first look for a used copy to purchase."
2,Springboring!,"This book is original in applying storytelling to business, and it offers some useful insights. The author comes across as earnest, honest and bright. So what's the problem? The writing style -- it's awful. Sentences are packed with irrelevant detail and, like kudzu, tangle and choke off the story itself. Instead of using simple words that create flow and momentum, Denning has created a syllabic jungle that you need a machete to hack through. Truly, this could have been an excellent booklet, but instead of being 30 pages, it's 200. There are lots of badly written business books, but when you write one on storytelling and can't tell a good story, there's a problem. To me, this was just barely worth the investment of time, and I was glad I borrowed rather than bought this book. I'm sorry if this comes across as mean-spirited, but after reading the other (glowing) reviews, I wanted to sound a note of warning to potential readers."
5,A unique look at the power of storytelling & KM,"The majority of KM books in the market are about KM tools, framework, & technologies, which focus on the strategic & scientific side of KM, 'The springboard' offers a rare & refreshing view on KM's 'soft' sides (employee behavior, cultural barrier etc.)It is one of the most unique books about Knowledge Management (KM) in the market. Denning has utilized a 'story-telling' writing style to illustrate how such style has enabled him to successfully launched & sustain KM initiatives at the World Bank. His KM journey at the Bank is vividly told, & can potentially served as a valuable lesson for business leaders who are keen to embed KM into the gene of their organizations."
2,Too much like previous,"This is the new ep for their fourthcoming album. If its any sign of the new material on the new album then I might just pass it up completly. The sound of this new release is that of the previous lp ""Forward"" The same trance like synth meets female vocals. Only this songs vocals are too distorted. Using this machine robotic effect on the voice. Which is a big no no. She does not need to cover up that pretty voice of hers. This ep offers several different versions of the title track including the video for it as well. If your not one to listen to the same song over and over then this ep is not for you. It has no other orginal songs. just the title. With hope the new album will not follow in this ep's tracks."
5,One More Day!,"When I received this CD from a friend of mine in 2005, I immediately became attached to it! These are some of the greatest and MOST uplifting songs that these HIT MAKERS have recorded! My personal favorites are ""Look Up And See God"" and ""One More Day."" And if you want to put your shouting shoes to use, listen to ""Let's Go Back To The Top Of The Mountain.""If you're fortunate enough to run across the CD, GRAB IT!!!"
3,Everything comes off but its a good collecters item.,"Only a collecters item. Not a toy to play with. Every part of the body comes off and is very hard to put back on. It comes with a ""The Empire Strikes Back"" stand and a blood red lightsaber. Cool but not to be messed around with. If getting it dont buy it online or at Toys R Us because its $9. At other stores its $5."
4,The Chosen Star Wars Fan (Jedi Temple) Cole Y.,"I know, it seems like I always like writing about the dark side. The Dark Side is not my favorite though! Darth Vader the Saga figure is a okay fig. Yes-- his upper part of his helmet always comes off! And it is super hard to stand him up. This figure is not rare. I found this Dark Lord of The Sith at Target right behind a AT-AT driver, and two R2s. At toys r us I found it behind one Snow Trooper! Not to brag but when I went to my downtown with my family I found it on a shelf right next to a Star Wars TCG Starter and Booster for E3!He comes with a hologram fig and base. For seven dollars I bought it! I am glad because I just finished my battle of hoth collection over the internet.Star Wars Rocks"
5,an amazing record,"this is one of the best records i have heard in a long time. the vocal mix between chris polito and lori marsh provides a unique dynamic impossible to find in other bands. the whole record from start to finish is great, and their live shows are absolutely crazy. the tracks that will grab you at first listen are: the final failure, rescue, recovery, and seven year divide. buy this record!! enjoy. . ."
3,Now Is The Time,This CD is very easy to listen to.. The arrangement of Bye Bye Blackbird is especially inovative and Bass led.
3,This Adobe crumbles.....,"Was looking for a ""quick step"" booklet to gather some tips on the versatile Adobe Acrobat 7.0 and this isn't quite it. I am a layperson for most computer technology. This book repeats processes that are already onscreen instructions and obvious to even the most basic user. This causes information overload and muddles and obscures any truly useful ""tips"" that are for intermediate users that might help you in the business world. I used a yellow highlighter on sections that were helpful or insightful. I found that I could condense the points onto a 3x5 card for easier reference. This book should be renamed Adobe Basics, or simplified to ""play with the toolbars on Adobe"". The zoom key means this...etc, the whole page key means this.... I will still search for a business person's pratical application guide to Adobe. I love their product, I would just quick-step over this one."
2,only half a light,"after two years of use, one of the two sockets become defective and inoperative. It provided good light when both sockets were operative but less so when only one is functioning. Also, it is a little tight to insert(or remove) the bulbs. Overall, I would buy another if I could expect that it would not half fail after another two years."
3,"Close, but not quite the perfect fit for a grand piano.","I mirror the complaint of another reviewer that the housing for the sockets -- and therefore the bulbs -- do not sit completely straight in the lamp. No matter how much I fiddle with it, I can't get the lamps to be parallel to the keys. I might get the housing parallel, but one of the bulbs protrudes out of the housing on one side.The clamp is sturdy and lined with felt, but it's too narrow to fit well on my baby grand's sheet music stand. The clamp needed to be pried apart to fit mine.This is a fair fit for a grand pianos - but far from perfect. I deem it to be cheaply made for the price and am on the search for a better fit."
2,only one socket working,"I thought this purchase would be the end of my search for the perfect light for my piano. It arrived today and only one socket seems to be working. I tried the same bulb in both sockets. It only lights up on the left side. I'm so disappointed, as I hate the hassle of returning things -- but back to Amazon it must go. I will try a different lamp -- perhaps built-in LED lights."
3,looks great fits Great doesn' work,recevied lamp and really like the style and fit on my piano. however one of the two bulb sockets does not work ! Lamp flickers off and on. When it works the light is great ! I returned item for exchange and am now waiting for try #2
1,Not enough light,"Not quite enough light. Instead, I bought the 19"" to try out. it is great with the 19"". Make sure you take into account the length of your music book. It is at least 17-18"" on mine."
1,Returned it and got a different one,"I got this lamp and thought the $122 price would buy me something decent. I had to return it due to the lack of enough light. The light was also too yellowish as I bought the light to have a better reading of the music book while I am playing. The yellow color light just did not do it. I eventually tried the 19"" LED version of Conoco Lighting on Amazon. This one cost $188. The extra $60 or so really got me what I really needed-- A piano lamp that has enough illumination and stylish for the whole setting of my living room. Just hope they would sell it for less."
1,Best Gloves Ever,"This seller is advertising the Wells Lamont 5130 work gloves (which are excellant by the way) but what you will receive is a pair of Ace Harware work gloves. But if I am only asked to review the Wells Lamont Gloves, I give them 5 stars. I love these gloves. Too bad Wells Lamont no longer makes them."
5,One HOT read,Mix one full-blooded cowboy with a country-girl at heart city slicker and you get one sizzling story. You can feel the chemistry at work from the time that Colt and Elise meet as the new co-owners of the Lonestar ranch. This a book that you won't want to put down!
4,Where's the Firespeeder?,I don't know why but for some reason the Coruscant Firespeeder Pilot reminds me of the vintage G.I. Joe Barbecue firefighter figure. Maybe it's because of the backpack tanks with the corded fire extinguisher gun and the protective helmet with shielded visor. The Firespeeder Pilot is a beautifully sculpted figure with multiple points of articulation at the elbows and pivoting knees so he can be dynamically posed and includes a display stand and randomly inserted mini-hologram figure. The only thing that is missing is a Firespeeder vehicle to go with it but chances are we won't ever get one because billion-dollar toy tycoon Hasbro says it costs too much to make new vehicles but they can for G.I. Joe???
3,Best Cookbook Ever,"I love the way the book is organized and my husband and I have found so many recipes, mostly for different kinds of game, that we had never seen before. I can't wait to start trying some of them."
1,utter garbo,"This game seems on the surface like another covert-ops-stealth-infiltration game, a la Metal Gear or Splinter Cell. The key difference between Metal Gear or Splinter Cell and this titles is that Metal Gear and Splinter Cell didn't suck.The controls are very crappy. I often found myself running in circles trying to get into the perfect spot so the stupid little green icon would come up and let me DO SOMETHING. The plot is more cheesy than a fifty pound block of Wisconsin Cheddar. The 'voice acting' sounds like something taken from a soap opera... and a low-budget soap opera at that. Add to that some horrible programming bugs that really should have been caught during playtest (the only voice prompt given to me was 'great job, move on to the next area'... even as I was shot and dying...) and you're left with a sorry excuse for a knockoff.Bottom line... save your money and get something else."
2,get Mission Impossible: Operation Surma instead,This game is tough. You have to sneak around steathily because if you get caught it is impossible. The plot is terrible and the voices are as bad as castlevania. It's dumb that the gaurds like can't see you in the dark if you are crouching down and right behind them stealing something from his pocket. Good level design. Graphics aren't really jaw droping. NOT VERY FUN
3,"Sneakier, Sassier, Harder than Tombraider...not as good","This game has its perks...the graphics, the sounds, the weapons of choice....NOT BAD....this game is for hardcore gamers who thrive on action-packed, stealthy games. It is not, however, easy at all. The stick movement bites(must use both L and R analog at the same time to control the character), and the sneaking around too much is not what i thought it would be. I would have preferred the all-out, guns blazing approach, no lives spared...but that's just me...if you prefer the stealthy games, you will love this game. And if you are hardcore tombraider-type fans, you will hate this game! guaranteed."
4,Fun but not much of a challange,"I bought this game because of the reviews. I liked it, but I found it to be too easy to beat. Glad I didn't pay much for it."
5,Life thru rose colored glasses,The cd was real good it was one of his best cds it brings out the wamth in his music.And also makes you feel alive and takes away for just a moment lifes perssures.So feel free to buy this on its a winner.
5,Wish I could rate higher,"As a student that does stage crew, this book is worth its weight in platinum. It is full of everything you need to get up and running for any theatrical event; whether amateur, school, or professional, this book will fulfill the needs of it all.With tips ranging from carpentry to lighting and sound, and even how to manage the stage crew themselves, you really cannot go wrong buying this book, especially if you are a sponsor or director.After hearing about this book, many crew members also bought this book and they also say the same things I do.Heck, my stage crew sponsor LOVES this book. Well, after all, he should, if you catch my drift."
2,You must be joking,"Disappointing to say, but it's rather hard to get past the immature writing. The author breaks about every rule of good writing and composition for excessive and off-track babbling about things that no one who bought the book would want. Yes, it's supposed to make it more fun/entertaining, but I felt it diffused rather than enhanced the book. I wouldn't recommend this book even though it contains one redeeming value: Each topic covers a helpful ""Why do I need to know this"" section that at least gives purpose to the read and is helpful for young students."
4,Ideas for newer advisor,"I am a relatively new financial advisor and was looking for some suggestions other than cold calling to get clients when I bought this book. I found it. This book had some great ideas and helped me brainstorm other new ones. I do however think that some of the strategies in this book are being used by many financial advisors today. Especially since this book is over ten years old. So you are not going to be the first one to ""think"" of these things, but it still may help the wheels turning in you head to think of something new."
5,A business model for the 21st century,"Moeller highlights the philosophical and ethical advantages of effort-less marketing and places it in context with the historical development of the financial services industry--AND provides the blueprint you can use to build a business that works for your clients and works for you.I bought in, hook line and sinker after hearing the author speak at a practice management workshop. During some one-on-one time after the presentation, Moeller came across as the real deal--""effort-less marketing"" is not just another sales tactic, it is a comprehensive philosophy that is win-win-win."
5,Great Concept!,This book is an excellent tool for developing business relationships. I am new to financial services and I cannot stress enough how much a client-focused approach has improved my business. Starting out I was trained to sell products but by using the concepts in the book I have had much more success and have built better relationships with my clients. Highly recommend!
5,Very exciting.,A very exciting book to read. Be prepared to restructure your entire business model after reading it. It will cause you to focus in and gain a lot of clarity on the type of financial advisor you with to be and the type of clients you wish to work with. It isn't just a conceptual book. It includes good details on how to implement the ideas.
5,He walks his talk!,I have had the luxury of getting to know Steve on a first hand basis ever since this book was recommended to me! In his book he shares with you all of the meat you should incorporate into your business right away! Combine reading the book and following it with contacting him to talk with him one on one and perhaps attend a workshop. The book is easy to follow and is essential to crafting your business around a marketing angle as opposed to a sales approach. It gives you direct insight so you can better understand what marketing is and how to customize your business plan in an effective manner very quickly. I would start reading is asap if you want to get put a plan in place that will help you build a successful financial career! He has done the heavy lifting for you and you can start implementing the steps he outlines right away. Have fun!
5,Great Stragegies,This book helped me view my book of business in a new way. I no longer cold call or do seminars and have acqired the same amount of new clients. The idea of letting your best clients find you new clients is one that I did not think of before reading this book. I have focused on bettering my relationships with my top 20% of my clients. I now have a hand full of advocates as clients and they do the work for me. I get calls from their friends and families introducing themselves. My business was up last year in a very tough environment.Thanks SteveChris Atsaves
5,Very helpful,"This is the bible for financial planning. It gives very specific instructions on building a financial planning practice. I read it once, but now have to read it a second time to make sure I haven't missed anything. I now focus on attracting the kind of clients I want instead of just blindly going after any client. I especially like the part about creating strategic alliances."
5,Valuable Reference Tool,"Steve's book provides advisors with new school marketing techniques. Once you finish reading the book, it all comes together and makes perfect sense. Marketing doesn't have to be pulling teeth if you follow some of his proven step by step strategies. Before you go and spend thousands of dollars on advertising or mail drops, read the book and go back to your client practice."
4,Transform your business,I have followed Steve's work since 1997 and this book puts it all together. I have several of his systems and have participated in coaching and this book can transform your business and life. At the very least it will illuminate the issues that must be addresed for the next generation of financial advisors. If you follow the steps in the book you will begin to create a business with a higher reward than just better income. Every advisor should read this book.
5,"A ""How To"" book for financial advisors","Steve Moellers book provides a template for financial advisors to follow if they are serious about growing their business. Although advisors may benefit more by hiring Mr. Moeller as a consultant, this book is an excellent resource for the ""do-it-yourself'er"" or the advisor that simply wants to focus on specific elements of business improvement i.e. image, publicity, marketing etc.Especially valuable for those advisors who focus on ""the sale"", and neglect the 4 critical steps that lead up to that event.I will continue to use the book as a reference in my annual business planning process.Mark Garrod The Practical Investor, LLC mgarrod@sigmarep.com"
1,Not my kind of Blues music,I wish I could have previewed the CD before I purchased it. I took a chance because I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan and was really disappointed.
3,disappointing,"While this compilation starts off well, the last few tracks are misguided at best. Susan Tedeschi is blues for soccer moms(do soccer moms get the blues?) and while Los Lobos is one of my favorite bands ever, I wouldn't immediately associate them with this type of music. A track by Taj Mahal, Little Charlie and The Nightcats, Charlie Musselwhite, Corey Harris, T-Bone Walker, Lightin' Hopkins, Mose Alison or the version of Fleetwood Mac that featured Peter Green (and the list goes on...) would have rounded the disc out in a more complete fashion.The series of ""essential"" blues compilations The House of Blues label released a few years ago or the Blues Masters series on Rhino Records would be a better place for the novice to start."
2,Poor Blues Collection,"As a long time Blues player, I was very disappointed with this set from two perspectives: poor quality recordings on the CD itself (I expected a better digitally mastered sound, and the imprinted sound volume was sorta lower than normal) and the actual collection of selected songs (not overly representative of the best Blues by these artists or Blues in general). I had seen part of it on PBS TV and bought the collection w/o first listening to it. So after spending the big bucks for it, I was sorely disappointed and do NOT recommend it for anyone serious about the Blues. It's just an okay set. There are many other higher quality collections online. Check them out first."
4,Blues Rocks!,"This album is a wonderful compilation of different artists singin' the blues. From John Lee Hooker to Etta James to Susan Tedeschi to Stevie Ray Vaughan, many different types of blues are included. How can you go wrong with this? I wanted to start a blues collection, and I'm so glad that I bought this one. Everyone should get this for a rounded collection of blues!!!"
2,Disposable.,"This is the only weak moment in Gentle Giant's brilliant history. It is their last gasp as they attempt to update their sound to make them more accessable to a broader audience. They needn't have bothered as the general public and Gentle Giant fanatic's avoided this one. You should too as none of their creativity and complexity is evident here. Aside from one or two cuts this sounds like bad, late seventies new wave. Avoid this, get the rest of 'em...Simon"
1,What a shame,"I truly love Gentle Giant, but this album shows how corrupt the world we live in really is. I believe that Gentle Giant had a modest fan-circle, so they decided to boost it by making commercial (I can't say the word, though I'd really love to). Or maybe I do them injustice, cause they had an accident on their tour which made them loose their ingenious sense for perfection. If you compare this album to their early ones, it's like a rocket scientist became a garbage man, cause he thought the pay is better. If you like earlier music of Gentle Giant, don't buy this one. This album is blasphemy."
3,Quality,This was my second type purchasing this product. These bulbs last and last and it a pleasure not having to change the outside lamp 2-3 tomes per year. I would have rated them a 5 however one of the bulbs burnt out immediately after inserting it into the fixture.
5,Help With The Show,I found this book helped explain a little more about Sydney and actually put you in her head a little better. I would recommend reading this book to anyone who just began watching season 1 or even a confused person on season 3. I love the Alias TV Show and I think anyone else as obsessed as I am would love the novels from beginning to end.
1,Only good if you're a pre-teen girl,"I happen to love the Alias TV show, so much that sometimes it borders on obsession. So I added this book to my wish list and a friend bought it for my birthday. I didn't get past page 12. The writing is like something out of a cheap romance novel (Sydney's unpierced navel is discussed) and the characters dialog doesn't match their style in the show. Overall I would pass unless you're a pre-teen girl."
5,Recruited: Must have read!,"If you'd like to know more about Sydney Bristow- her background, who she used to be before she realized the truth about SD-6 and joined the CIA, be sure to pick up ""Recruited"".As a prequel to the current timeline of ""Alias"", ""Recruited"" tells the story of how Sydney was recruited for SD-6 and her life as she changed following the days of joining what she then thought was a black-ops division of the CIA.Fast paced and full of action, this is an excellent read to any ""Alias"" fan as well as newcomer to the show."
2,a waste of time,"I'm a big fan of Alias and while I am find the story of how Sydney Bristow became an agent of SD-6 is surely an interesting story, in the book my fascination was slowly destroyed by Lynn Mason's pendantic and childlike writing. I'm very unsure why this book was targed for middle school girls and dispointed in how this tranlated into butchering Sydney's character. Yes she was shy and bookish, but there were certainly defter ways to illustate this. The Dean Carrouthers plotline, ripped out of some Sweet Valley High book could have easily been done away with.I did like how Francie was potrayed and that we get a glimpse of charcters like Noah, Dixon, and Sloane who will become very imporant in Sydney's future.I did not like that no one can adequatly explain how Sydney becomes a super blackbelt karate fighter in 6 months. it.does.not.happen."
3,"Not great, but short and fun.","I always enjoyed the tv show Alias, so when I picked up some tie-in novels for my sister, I decided to read them before sending them to her. Recruited tells the story of how Sydney Bristow, exemplary student but shy and withdrawn, first joins SD-6, covert branch of the CIA. Some well-known characters from the show appear, including Francie, Jack, Sloan, and a cameo by Dixon.Recruited certainly isn't the best tie-in novel I've ever read (not even the best Alias tie-in novel); Sydney is depicted as a little too immature and socially awkward at the start and grows up unrealistically fast once she joins the agency. However, it's a quick read and for fans of the tv show, a fun way to visit old friends."
2,"a little thin but, not bad at all","I was a little confused about how this is considered ""young adult""as Alias is geared more towards adults and is more than a little dark at times on TV. (If you haven't watched, you're missing out)The story was a little plain for about the first half and maybea little too easy to read (i.e. young adult) but, I kept goingand everything takes a more serious tone once Syd is contactedand enlisted into SD-6. There after the book picks up and becomes fairly close to what you see on Sundays. All together not a bad start for a book series and I did enjoy the references to the show and ""seeing"" where Sydney came from."
2,Not much substance...,"I love the show Alias and had hoped the books would fill in some holes about Sydney's past, her recruitment, etc. The books do provide some details but the books stay pretty general. It's obvious they cannot provide too much detail or it might conflict with the writing for the show (which frequently draws from the past to explain the present) The books focus on getting to know Sloane, her strained relationship with her dad, etc. The writing is pretty bland--this is one situation where the show is BETTER than the book. My final irritation with the books (and I've read several) is that they tend make Sydney look dumb and naive. She will ""save the day"" and then we the reader see the final ""secret email"" proving she helped the bad guy, etc. She comes off looking really dumb. Read the books if you must but get them from the library...."
4,Great insight into the beginning of Alias,This book is a must for any Alias fan. It details how Sydney became a part of SD-6. The book is very well written with alot of plot movement. Many questions from the show are answered and it is nice to see how Sydney's life developed. The best part of the book is seeing Sydney's transformation from insecure college student to a confident agent.
1,Don't waste your money.,"Ok, I wanted to like this, I really did, I even bought the silly book, but it's just not worth it.As Victor Garber (Jack Bristow) once said ""...back stories are overrated."" In this case he was right. There is absolutely nothing you needed with which to understand the show encompassed between the two cheesey covers. Compared to the show, the writing level is very poor. Chances are if you are young enough that you are impressed by this book's scholastic merits, then you are too young to understand the show anyways."
2,Acceptable,"The reading level for this book is quite low. I was disappointed that it was written at such a remedial level.Nevertheless, because I am a fan of the show, I wanted to know what brought Sydney into SD-6. This book was an acceptable book to answer those questions.The APO series is written in a much better tone and reading level for adults."
2,How did this get past an editor?,"Wow. I mean just, wow. How did a phrase like ""mini-eternity"" make it past an editor? How did it make it out of a so-called writer's head? WTF is a mini-eternity?The story is ok, but the writing is jarringly bad."
3,The Recruit,"Well, it was an OK presequel to the Alias TV show. If you like the show and your a rabit fan like I am you will be a little disappointed in this book. One big beef I have with the writer of this book is the total disregard that she had a long time family relationship with Arvin Sloane. In watching the TV show you know Arvin and Emily practically raised her because Jake was a drunk after ""Laura"" died. So, I find it a bit hard to believe the whole bit in the book that she never knew Sloane until that meeting at HQ. It does one good thing it explains how she met Noah Hicks."
1,Joke,"Much,Much,Much smaller than the picture. Looks like it came out of a gumball machine! I've seen better looking costume jewelry at Wal-Mart. I would be ashamed to give it to my wife for Xmas. Actual value is probably $1.98. What a chump I am, just spent $200.00 on junk."
3,Spanish speaker a bit fast.,"Lots of material for your buck. The ""Learn in your car"" segment has a booklet to go with the CD. I find this necessary, but you can,t read it while you drive. Also the spanish speaker talks to fast. He repeats it twice in spanish, both times fast. It would be better if it was slow once and then again faster. I also own the Pimsleur Spanish and also the methods of Michel Thomas. It gets rather old sticking to one system and I like using the other methods as a change of pace."
4,Spannish lessons,"I found this very good, easy to follow and practical.If you are in a crunch and have a chance to go through only a few of the first CDs you will be able to carry on a basic conversation during your travels to Spanish speaking country. If you can combine it with some real world practice aor maybee structured learning it will be an even better tool. I found it too soothing for the car though."
2,Cheese Cake during World War II,"Elmer Simms Campbell was one of the few African American cartoonists to break the color line. He drew cartoons for Esquire from 1933-1953. Few people knew that Campbell was a black man. His cartoons were primarily of scantily clad white women or pin up girls. This book is a collection of his cartoons, but there isn't even a bio on the artist. There is no commentary on Campbell or his work.For more information on Campbell you can google him and find some information on Wikipedia. Or better still go to Tim Jackson's site: ""Pioneering Cartoonists of Color.""Historically, Campbell is often credited with being the first African American cartoonist, but George Herriman, a creole who passed for white, was really the first. He was the creator of Krazy Kat. Ollie Harrington and Jackie Ormes were two other pioneering black cartoonists."
5,Cheaper than the Local Parts Store,I had to replace the plug wires on my daughter's car so I decided to do the plugs at the same time. I checked prices on new plugs and found they were better on Amazon and with Prime I could get them in just two days. I ordered the plugs that Amazon indicated would fit her car. They arrived a day sooner than was indicated and now her car is running great. Autolite makes good plugs and I am very happy with this purchase and even happier that my daughter has a well running car now.
4,"Comprehensive, good chronological overview",Would recommend buying it to anyone interested in a general outline of the geology of NJ. Some information a little outdated but generally very good.
1,tow strap review,"These straps were advertized as 10,000 lb straps that is not what they are they are 3700# working strength with break rating of 10,000# this is very misleading and a disappointment when you recieve them."
2,"Highland 10177 30' x 2"" Tow Strap with Hooks, 10,0 pound capacity",Very thin. Wouldn't use it for large trucks or SUV's. Hooks could be a little wider.
2,Frustrating,"I've been stepping for about 3 months, so I'm not a complete newbie. Even so, I found this video frustrating.One: The music seems to have been added as an afterthought. Kathy's movements and counts don't always match the beat of the music.Two: Kathy's explanations of what movement comes next and what arm movements to do are often poor. Her cues to change movements come late and sometimes not at all.I'm sure it's a good workout, but I like to alternate between several different videos for variety, so I don't memorize the routines. I like to be led from one move to the next. I don't get that here."
3,Too complicated for me.,"I like the higher impact of step aerobics, but I am too much of a klutz to follow her dance steps. If you're good at dance, you'll enjoy it."
2,Where's the rest of the music?,"All this album has is the score. No songs like Shattered, and Jane's addiction wasn't on there. Neither was the song that the french kingpin was listening to while driving after before he got pulled over.Where are those songs?"
3,Wow!,This CD was put together really well- If I could do something this great I would make millions!!!!
1,No words...,"I was very disappointed that the music on this CD is not even similar to the music in the movie. When I was watching this movie I remember saying, ""This is going to be a good soundtrack."" Not at all...."
1,Disapointed =(,"This movie had some great music but turns out that none of it is on the soundtrack. The best song in the movie was not on the Soundtrack which was very disapointing, that song is the Linkin Park song which the French dude is listening to in his Uncles car before he gets pulled over. Although if you type in""Linkin Park SWAT""In your KaZaa search, it will find that song and it says it is part of the SWAT Soundtrack, but really it isnt. This soundtrack is actually really pitiful and I wouldnt waste a penny on it."
1,Where's the music ppls???,"Where is the rest of the music from the movie..... does anyone know the name of the Linkin park song played by the french guy in his uncles car?? i want the lyrics, but somebody needs to find out why there isn't any of the good music...."
2,What the hell?¿,"OK, the best song in the movie is when they do that test that says ""NUMBER 1....time is runing out, NUMBER 2....time is running out.."" that is a great song. everyone seems to be having troubles with what the linkin park song is called, this is Figure .o9 found on METEORA. as for the other great songs in the soundtrack, (for instance Crosstown traffic by jimmi Hendrix). if anyone knows the name of the ""time is running out song, PLEASE EMAIL ME!! as for the soundtrack, yea it sucks, dont buy it."
1,Foreign Song,"This soundtrack is not for me :P Does anyone know the name of the song that was in the movie during the sceen when they 'recruit' LL Cool J? The one with the guy running down the alley. It is not in English but it is a fast paced, high energy song. I would love to know what it is."
3,Original Music Credits,"I have notice a lot of people are wanting many of the non-classical songs from the movie which arn't included on this soundtrack. I have included a list of all of the songs, and preforming artists, classical and otherwise, in the same order as shown in the credits of the movie.1. Shattered by The Rolling Stones2. Oh Shooter by Thicke3. Columpio by El Gran Silencio4. Zacatecas by Genaro Codina5. Sinaloa by Banda La Estrella6. Figure .09 by Linkin Park7. Do You Want Some by Buppy8. I'm Coming by Jimmy Tha Joun9. Crosstown Traffic by Jimi Hendrix10. Sound Off (Duckworth Chant) by Willie Lee Duckworth11. Just Because by Jane's Addiction12. Women In My World by 1313. Time Is Running Out by Apollo Four Forty14. Tell Me by Long John Hunter15. Brother Down by Sam Roberts16. Y Yo Sigo Aqui by Paulina Rubio17. S.W.A.T. 911 by Barry DeVorzon18. Give Your Life A Break by John GipsonI think this list will help you find what you are most likely looking for."
4,sweat to swat!!!,"This sound track contains both,music to jam to and music to work out to!Most songs(about 12)are very energetic,with a high pulse to the beat and a fast pace to the track.On the other hand,this sound track is as tense to work out to as that of ROCKY!If you're looking for a sound track that does both this is it!"
2,Unusual choice of composer,"To me, Elliott Goldenthal was a surprise choice of composer for the movie, although critically acclaimed for several scores his only previous action movie was Demolition Man. For SWAT, one might have expected a score from the Media Ventures team, such as Harry Gregson-Williams (whose Spy Game score was used briefly on the trailer for SWAT).The result is an orchestrally based score, with heavy use of dischordant strings to emphasize the chaotic nature of the gun fights. Not having seen the film yet, I cannot comment how effectively this might work in the picture, but on CD it is not an easy listen. There doesn't appear to be an easily recognisable signature theme for our heroic `boys in blue' and the tense moments seem more akin to Alien3 than a cop movie. Although I enjoyed Goldenthal's work in ""Heat"", listeners looking for a pumped-up, pounding action score should go elsewhere."
2,warm and pretty... until you wash it,"I loved this warm fuzzy blanket when I first bought it. Then my mother visited and threw it in the washing machine. I was disappointed because the fibers got all smashed down after washing. Maybe my Mom didn't follow the directions on the tag, but it never looked the same since the first washing.I also made the mistake of covering my 2-1/2 month old baby with this blanket while she was sleeping. Then I found her kicking and fussing in her crib with the blanket completely covering her head. I freaked out and ordered a baby sleepsack the next morning. I still use this blanket to cover her when I am holding her because it is very warm.Please don't let your baby sleep unattended with this blanket. It is too heavy and could sufficate the baby."
2,Picture of Product no match for actual product shipped,Picture of Product on WEB Page shows two 27 Black cartridges and one tricolor cartridge but eventually the product description does say it is only one each. I feel like the discrepancey cost me the price of one cartridge.
1,Bait and switch!,"The photo clearly shows three print cartridges, but they send only two! There is no excuse for this since now I see other similar reviews."
1,Not as pictured? Buyers Beware,The picture makes you believe that you are getting a 3 pack which includes 2 black and one color cartridge very misleading. But in actuality you are only getting a two pack one black and one color cartridge. If you knew that you were only selling a two pack combo that is the picture you should have put up. Not worth it to me very misleading seller. Go to best buy next time I really didnt save money or get a good deal by shopping with this seller.
2,Not As Pictured!,"Normal combo pack I have previously purchased had two black cartridges and one color cartridge and is just like the one pictured. Combo pack I received had only one each of black and one color cartridge. Wasn't quite the bargain I thought I purchased! but, not worth the postage to return. Buyer Beware!"
1,i want my money back,this pile was one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life. ive watched childrens plays that were acted out better than this. there were parts where it seemed the actors were reading from cue cards. there were long pauses in between lines. the dialog was horrible. the characters werent believable. there wasnt even any cheesey humor to save this movie. i love low budget b movies but there just wasnt anything there in this one. the only thing slightly realistic about this movie was that the characters werent all young and attractive like most slasher movies. they were fat and ugly. but that didnt quite save the movie. save yourself some money and rent this if you can find it anywhere. ill be suprised if you make it through 30 minutes of it.
4,Support the underground,"Suport the underground,as I did.From time to time I buy here some indie horror,and I always will.These filmakers dont have lot of money,but heart on the right place.Like Undertow.This film is low-budget,gory,return to horrors of the 70s and 80s/remember all those killers in the woods,blood and wonderful nature?.../.It has its faults,but true fan can overlook it,and have good time with this from fans to fans gory low-budget horror."
3,Throwback To 70's Horror,"The Undertow is a throwback to 70's horror movies, particularly The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Town That Dreaded Sundown. However, it doesn't live up to the movies it pays homage to. It has plenty of gore and an awesome killer (that doesn't have near enough screen time), but it also has pacing problems and characters that you won't give a damn about. Still, it's worth seeing once if you are a slasher fan."
3,movie review,This was a good short movie which I enjoyed with my friends who love horror movies. Storyline was excellent and kept you guessing as to what was going to happen.
1,Tears up clothing and cuts grandson's finger,"Do NOT buy this item unless you want to shred your clothing as you put it on with this reacher. It grabbed my bathing suit, making an ugly run in the fabric. Then it latched onto my pjs and made a tear in them. By this time I figured out that the end of the reacher is very poorly made, thin, sharp, unprotected aluminum. To make things worse, my little 2-year-old grandson (who uses my other reacher to pick up his toys for fun ) picked it up by the end before I could stop him and it cut his finger.I find it hard to believe that this is a Rubbermaid product. Nowhere on the reacher or package does it say made by Rubbermaid. I am very disappointed in this product.If you want a good reacher, get the one made by Duro-Med and sold thru Amazon by Maxiaids.I wish I had gotten another one instead of trying the ""Rubbermaid""."
3,Creative but Prejudiced,"Since Stanley Cavell was an esteemed philosophy professor at Harvard University, when he wrote this book, it was a boon for film theorists everywhere; the academic elite were finally taking film theory seriously. However, even though in the book there are great moments of insight into the spectatorship of films, Cavell is very biased towards his own cinematic experience and will often make broad claims to the superiority of the classic films with which he grew up over any recent film. His predilections are often purely personal and do not involve an objective understanding of the films. The book contains many wonderful moments that stem from a thought-provoking philosopher yet it is very difficult to experience them through the author's subjective prejudices."
5,I Loved It!!!,"If you like Chill Out...probably my favorite genre of Electronica...then this is a great CD to add to your collection. If you don't know much about Chill Out or other ""Ambient"" type music, then you might also want to consider purchasing this as it's got a good selection of different things.It's actually a collection of several separately sold CD's including: Later (2 CD Set); Electrochill; Electroburn; chillhouse; Chill, Vol.1; and Carol C. First Impressions. I would put them in about that order in terms of best to worst although all have something to offer. The 1st 3 (4 if you count Later as two) CD's are awesome but the quality falls off somewhat after that. You can't beat it for ~$20 though. FYI...somebody else on here said they liked ""The Essential Trance Collection"" but not this one. If feel exactly the opposite...""Trance"" was a joke, but ""Chill"" is a must have for those who enjoy Ambient and Lounge type music!"
1,What a dissapointment...most of the 'noise' is worthless! 'Caveat Emptor'..4 REAL !!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR DOUGH OR TIME,This so-called 'collection'puts one in mind of some purposeful experiment designed to prevent buyers from trusting any purchase without actually being able to listen to an entire selection prior to purchase!
1,Not Pleased,This turban is 100% polyester and reminds me of those stretchy book covers I used to buy for school. I am very disappointed with this. I debated buying it for (literally) a year then finally took the plunge because it was the only leopard print turban I found online. I will have to search for a better made (or at least better looking!!) leopard turban. Overall I would not recommend this item at all - especially since shipping is an additional $15.
4,A Very Good Companion for Bible Study Beginners,"The Catholic Bible Study Handbook is a very well organized, well written work by the Benedictine Jerome Kodell. He does a wonderful job in explaining the origins of the Bible and ways to study it objectively and spiritually. The part I find the most helpful is his concise summaries of each book of the Bible, explaining what they contain and where they fit in the historical context of Judeo-Christianity. This book doesn't pull out Catholic doctrine from the Bible (if you're looking for that, see Frederick Knecht's ""A Practical Commentary on Holy Scripture""), but leaves that the the Bible reader. This book is very user-friendly, as someone has already stated. It is a great handbook that can be used to Catholics and non-Catholics alike."
1,"Disappointing, dry and barely catholic","This book is disappointing. Little more than a surface treatment of background issues, it is not very well written. It presents a shallow style of pop biblical scholarship (circa 1970's), along with a dry and dated charismatic spirituality. What is lacking? For one thing, the rich Benedictine tradition of ""lectio divina"" is poorly presented (see the classic work of Damasus Winzen, OSB). Also lacking is an adequate treatment of spiritual exegesis, as recommended by Vatican II (Dei Verbum 12), and the Catechism of the Catholic Church (109-119). Try to find a used copy of Winzen's ""Pathways in Scripture,"" or maybe Shea's ""Making Senses of Scripture""."
3,A good foundation for study,I found this book to be a good foundation for Bible study. It answered many questions I would have had.
5,small babies,My two year old loves these little dolls she can not get enough of them. When she opened them for her birthday she screamed. :)
4,Great Introduction to the Great Composer,"This book provides a concise yet invaluable introduction to the life of Beethoven, providing an useful platform to further study of the great composer."
5,Gripping,"Wow. I walked into the record shop and this music was playing. It set a mournful, tragic, dramatic mood over everybody inside and i was caught too inescapably to do anything but buy the CD. I am glad i'm not feeling too suicidal while listening to them, because the Two Gallants might make me feel like i had good company while falling over the edge.I like the rollicking loud music, which reminds me of the Rubberneckers and even somewhat of old Clash; but it's the quieter, mournful stuff that really gets me. ""Threnody"" (word for an elegy or mournful death lamentation) is powerful, but so are several other parts, such as the lonesome whistling that sets the initial tone. If you want to be carried away in a tide of somehow inexpressible but well-communicated emotion, check this out."
2,Lite-weight with no real substance,"Covers the subject at a very high level with lots of consultant charts, tables and matrices. Great stuff if you need to fill a presentation with a lot of fluff. Deffinitely a teaser for a Booz&Allen consulting gig. You get a glimps of their template tools and lots of reference to how effective they are. Some interesting reading regarding major corporate alliance success stories, but never much drill-down. This book is targeted for the completely clueless exec, the dilentante on a long flight, any consultant-type who wants to look like they know something, or the B-school prof who adds this title to his supplemental reading list. Not recommended if you are the one who needs to make an alliance happen at your company. Let me know if there exist a more hands-on guide to making alliances happen."
2,Alliances light,"This book is really an introduction to alliances, preaching the Booz Allen mantra, and NOT a practical guide to alliances. The conflict of interest between helping the reader be self-sufficient in alliance building (ie, delivering what the reader is paying for)and enticing the reader to contact Booz Allen for work is clearly evident. Generally speaking, the book conveys excitement about the prospects of alliances, delivers some general anecdotal information and templates, and addresses some structural issues (without resulotion)--all without providing the tools needed for business development. I expected more of this book and was disappointed. Caveat emptor."
1,Overview but no best practice details,"What a ripoff! I bought this book to get a great look at best practices for managing strategic alliances. But on page 75 in chapter 5, here's what I got: ""The complete set of one hundred best practices and the associated skill levels is a proprietary tool that Booz-Allen uses with its clients, but let us consider here a few examples...""Yet another overview book that talks about the subject without giving you the meat."
5,"Clear, concise and plenty of new insights","I have read several books on strategic alliances. Frequently, I find a lot of repetitiveness. However, in this book I found a lot of useful and practical insights. This book provides lots of tools and frameworks to assess real work on strategic alliances. I believe this is a must read in the subject."
5,AT LAST - A common sense and workable approach to Alliances.,"Finally, a common sense and workable approach to the 'How To's' of creating and implementing alliances. Perhaps more importantly it clearly depicts how 'alliances' fit in the continuim of extended enterprises. The message is clear, insightful and useable!Thank You Peter & John"
3,Travel for Masochists,"Willis has gathered together some of the best (and least) known tales of polar exploration, failure and tragedy into one concise volume.Not a publishing landmark, but an enjoyable and educational read all the same. Certainly a useful book for those wishing to come to grips with the major players in polar exploration."
2,dog lovers beware,"My husband is reading the book first. He has informed me, an avid dog lover, that he is 12 pages into the book and has read 3 accounts of hapless adventurers eating their dogs to survive.I've asked him to dog ear(no pun intended)the stories that do not include canine cuisine."
4,Wild Child Butler Shows Us What He's Got,"George ""Wild Child"" Butler began playing the harmonica at the age of six while growing up in Alabama. he spent many of his early years hoboing and palying across the US,including a stint playing with Sonny Boy Williamson II. Butler began recording in the mid-1960's and has been fairly active ever since.This CD is a prime example ofwhy Wild Child is such an institution in the Blues. Butler is one heck of a capable harmonica player, effortlessly running off licks that would be the envy of any player. Butler's voice is exceptional, reminding us of the early Blues pioneers that we all enjoy so much.This cd is definitely worth adding to your collection."
2,Grossest DVD Ever!!!,"I bought a used copy of this dvd today, and plopped it into my dvd player as I sank on the couch. This is the most horrific,brutal,and most violent thing I have ever seen. They show real uncensored police footage along with fires. This is a really disturbing video. I recommend you don't watch this if your the least bit squeemish. Nasty! 2/5"
1,"Do not trustbBooks with ""Curry"" in the title","I bought this book for about $35 second hand from Amazon, expecting a large well illustrated hardback. It is a skinny 160 page paperback that retails for 10 pounds sterling!!! Having briefly look through the book, the content do not ""spring out"" as a useful contribution to this style of cooking."
1,What My Husband Doesn't Know,I started watching the movie and it was so bad I didn't continue. The acting was not good at all.
3,Reasonale entertainment,"The film reminded me too much ot Tyler Perry's creations. I liked the songs. However, the plot was a bit too simplistic. However, it did reinforce the theme that a strong marriage can outlast many things."
4,funny,"I thought it was funny at times, but overall very good. I thought this was a movie, not a play."
3,Plays,"I liked this play or movie, whatever you want to view it as. It was not one of my favorites; however, I will recommend it to others for the story it tells. I liked the storyline because it tells of things women and men go through everyday."
2,Weak,"I ordered this play because of the reviews. I'm not sure what everyone saw in this play but I found it to be weak and a bit phony. I love Brian White and the role he played but the rest was just blah. The BFF was too much the way she threw herself at Paul, who does that? Her acting was a little over the top."
4,Pretty good,"I wasn't able to watch it all at once but was very entertaining. Actually thought it was a movie when I selected it, but later found out differently... Loved the music!"
4,Great,"I was expecting a movie, but got a play instead. It kept on point, kept me involved in the plot and was very good."
1,What my husband doesn't know....Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG!!! I mean what can I say about this play....hmmm.....boring, boring, boring. I'm not putting the seller down because it arrived ontime, and in new condition. It's just this movie is so boring, my fiance and I fell asleep on it woke back up and fell asleep on it again. Michelle Williams is a horrible actress...I'm sorry, Beyonce defently out does her in looks and acting,lol. I thought this movie would be good like Tyler Perry plays...no no no.....I'm sticking to my ""Madea""...don't waste your money, go and rent it from Blockbuster's or borrow it....you can have mine if you want, but don't spend money on it. I'm trying to sell it for $2.00 at a garage sell,seriously this play is sooooooo boring!"
5,Michelle Williams shines outside of Destiny's Child.,"This was an awesome play. Enjoyed the plot as well as the acting. What woman isn't aware that a younger man her own age is attractive when she's married to an older man. This play touches on the saying, ""The grass isn't always greener on the other side"". Great date movie."
2,THANK GOD ITS OVER .,"I have been struggling to finish this book for about a week now. Oh, was it ever painful. I have absolutely no idea why I insisted on finishing it, but finish it I did...oh, what a chore! First of all, for me to like a romance written from only the heroines point of view, it has to be exceptional. ""The Sea Wife"" was far from it. The h/h drove me insane and I could never understand what Sabina saw in Myles when all he ever was was nasty. I will admit that the book finally got SOMEWHAT interesting at page 185. This is the ONLY REASON I awarded this story with more than 1 star. Would I recommend this?? Well, if you are an insomniac and need something to bore you into unconciousness, then by all means..partake. As for the rest of you readers out there who value your precious free time...youve been warned!"
1,"Feels unfinished, needs stronger editing....","I don't understand why these two care for one another. The most interesting part of the book is cut out- the shipwreck- then they marry, she spends inordinate sums of his money on clothes and wastes my time whining or crying b/c he is sullen, moody, cruel and rude. I keep reading that she is intelligent, but you don't see any evidence of this. Myles is a former convict- wealthy, but bitter and there isn't any appeal for me in his charachter. They are supposed to be attracted to one another, but you never feel any heat or purpose.The end comes out of nowhere- ooops- spoiler alert- she gets shot by his drug addicted ex and he decides that he can't possibly go on without her? Oh, and he will support charities and guide poor criminal children? Geez.... All in all: if you want to read of a couple acting adolescently and indignant then pick this one up."
1,This book is boring,"The name of the book is quite exciting. The picture is also very inviting. The beginning of the book does start off well. She is rescued by a handsome man from drowning on the high seas... she awakens in a cabin on another rescue ship...After they got married I was waiting for some kind of intimacy. There is none. Even when they get back to land, they still do not even do more than kiss and the female character gets very upset about it.She is also too independant and open-mouthed. The male character's flashbacks into the past are too frequent and not very interesting. I was to the point that I was rolling my eyes.I wish there was more intimacy between the main characters. I think the female needs to ""let go"" a little bit and the male needs to become more firm with his wife and stop dwelling in the past.I am really struggling to finish this book."
4,A True Man of God,"This is a very good biography of a true man of God. The book details how Pastor Dan Ronsisvalle overcame poverty and a drunken father to become the pastor of one of the largest Assembly of God churches in America and certainly in Alabama. I had the priveledge of sitting under his preaching at Leeds Assembly in Leeds, Alabama and am a much stronger follower of Jesus Christ because of it. The story of Pastor Dan and Sister Fern will be an inspiration to young people of any denomination who are preparing for the ministry.Pastor Dan went home to be with the Lord in November, 2003."
3,Progressive house that should please most fans....,"While not the hardest house tracks around, DJ Garth (resident SFO) serves up a constant mix of smooth, bass-filled tracks. Not listed here is an incredible remix of Love and Rockets ""Resurrection Hex"" that slams and really gets things going. Well arranged tracks make for a steady rythm. Not bad..."
1,Wrong album. Do not download.,All the tracks on this album are wrong. These tracks are from some other album. Do not download.
3,just average..,"Very short battery life. 18-20 hrs on standby. Make sure the city you live in has good coverage. Amazon said there was no coverage on the city I live in. Two other retailers said otherwise. Big mistake. I hardly get one bar at all times. It only works when I'm at work, 15 miles up north. Amazon claims there is no coverage there either, but this time they were wrong. Plan on buying extra ringtones and wallpapers since the phone has a very limited amount. Very nice and sleek looking phone though. That is not good enough to give it anymore stars. If you go with cingular and you want a decent priced(or free maybe?) phone with a plan, go with the sony-ericsson one."
5,i LOVE this phone,"i love the LG-L1400 i have resently bought it and i am in love with it. it's cheap but good quitly, i put insurance on mine so that if it brakes i will no matter what get a new one. On this phone you can take pictures in balck and white or color, you can send and recieve pictures, you can go on the internet, it had polyphonic and real music tones, text messaging, the whole enchalada. What i really love is when someone calls i can see their picture or another picture. its so awesome. this phone is my dream phone, because in the past i've have a ghetto fabulous phone.lol. If you want anything that i have said then you need the LG-L1400 cell phone."
2,This phone's antenna is easily broken,The Antenna broke while the phone was in my pocket and now the antenna alone is $50.00 through LG. No other places sell LG phone parts.
1,Cingular is deceptive,"My review is on Cingular. I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used. THEY LIE. THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY. THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area. If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular. Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse."
1,HORRIBLE PHONE,ok i got this phone in october i thot it waz great at 1st every1 loved it cuz it looked so cool. but then in March it started where u cldnt hear anythin from the other person. so we sent that one bac and i got a new 1 well now well actually yesterday it did the same thing so we took the cover off and looked at it this time and we saw the wire came on the platform so we were tryin to fix it but nuttin worked and he ended up breakin the other wire so now im prolly goin to hav to get another phone and i know now that just because it looks cool doesnt mean it will b a good phone
1,"Eager anticipation, then disappointment","I heard selections from this CD on a National Public Radio program, and thought they were wonderful. My impression was of a refined, high-brow, tasteful heir to Spike Jones, PDQ Bach, Hudson Shad, et al. As a fan of both good music and good satire, I HAD to order the disk!Alas, while there are indeed some outstandingly clever pieces, a fair number of selections are R-rated, with vulgar and profane language and subject matter. I was looking for Monet and found Maplethorpe ! It is an unfortunate juxtaposition of 19th century instrumentals with the lyrics and subject matter of rap. There was no hint of this in the description or the other reviews; needless to say, only the G-rated tracks were played on the public airwaves.There is not a place for this offering to remain in my collection. Pity, for the concept WAS sheer genius..."
1,Utter useless trash.,"This book is no more than a rewrite of the OMG specifications (which cost nothing) and a poor one, at that. Must be dangerously close to violating copyright rules too. Complete waste of time."
1,Want to learn CORBA?,"If you bought this book to learn CORBA programming, then good luck. Most of the information seems to be from the OMG web pages. Not a single example of a CORBA implemention. This is one of those books you'll soon see for $.99 at the grocery store."
1,Aweful aweful aweful....,Never have I seen someone plagerize someone elses work like this! I've actually heard this guy speak and it sounds as though he's only made it through life stealing off of the effort of others. Definitely and 'not recommended' reading.
1,Basically - Don't waste your money on this book!,Corba great language! Terrible book!Why do you think eBay sells the for $ 1.00 and sometimes don't bring any bids at that price.A real money and time waste!
4,O yeah!,"I recently went to Hawaii and bought this for 15 dollars. You can find this at some electronic stores on the mainland though and theyre cheaper by a lot so do that...The CD is good. Not has good as all the riffy stuff from FLCL but still fricken good. I love Terminal Heavans rock and the Last track by far. The last track is actually 2 songs but one is hidden and you have to fast forward a minute to here it.My favorite song though is most definately ""I know you"" and I don't care if it has bad english lyrics. I still like it.Just a few days till the new album ""my foot"""
5,WTF!?,This isn't Penalty Life.... this is Good Dreams which I'm not giving a review on but Penalty Life is the one that actually has the sample songs available on this page available....Just thought you'd like to know! AND pillows rock SO 5 stars!
2,It's beautyful but not work good,"When I received it, it do not work at all. And the Amazon warranty do not cover the battery. I want to walmart and changed the battery. it cost me $4.26. And I think the watch is very old, the mark on the back said it was producted in Oct, 2004. And now, it always worked half hour later for a day. Anyway, it looks very beautiful"
3,The Little Boombox that Could,"I purchased my first Philips Shoqbox last year & happily surprised with the sound that came of such a little package! It really amplified the sound from my laptop & Ipod, aside from wowing my tech-savvy brothers. While many of the popular complaints are true (e.g. small, non-expandable 256 MB memory, difficult user interface, etc), I overlooked all of this due to its amazing portability & sound.The sad news is that I ordered a 2nd Shoqbox for Christmas this year at Amazon's steeply discounted rate; however, the internal battery was dead & could not be revived after 3 days of continuous charging! Ugggh! I was so hoping it would work but I ended up having to return it to Amazon.It's hit-or-miss with the Philips PSS110. Just wish they could come out with a new, improved model since this is one of a kind!"
3,LOCKS UP!!!,"I'VE FOUND THAT IF YOU SCAN TOO QUICKLY THROUGH SONGS THE UNIT LIKES TO LOCK UP. PLUS MY RESET BUTTON WONT WORK. OTHER THAN THAT, AWSOME DEAL FOR $45."
4,Philips PSS110/17 256 MB Personal MP3 Sound System,An excellent item. The only drawback is that the system does not receive radio signals very well without something plugged in acting like an antenna. When the antenna or the power cord are plugged in reception is good but bad otherwise.
2,"Frustrating, complicated, useless.","My nine year old bought this with her Christmas money. She could not use it...it's just too complicated. So, I bought it from her thinking it would be great on my desk at work...well, I spent HOURS trying to convert files blah blah blah to get my music on this thing, never got it working. On top of that, the radio gets very poor reception, even with the antenna plugged in. I gave up on this and bought an Ipod. It took me 10 minutes to get everything set up on the Ipod. I guess you don't need to spend hours swearing, installing and uninstalling software, and converting files to listen to music, you just need to NOT buy this product, get an Ipod. I hate music match, and I hate this Shoqbox. I gave it two stars for cuteness and good speakers."
4,Hollywood Trainer Boxed Set - A Winner!,"I used to watch the Hollywood Trainers show on cable Lifetime channel and was disappointed when the show was discontinued, so I decided to find any tapes that might be available on line. I was happy to find the 7 DVD set sold by Amazon. It works for me. It provides a good workout in different areas - abs, yoga, pilates, cardio, etc. Since I have worked out all my adult life I find them more challenging than the usual lite workouts for mature adults. Jeanette Jenkins is upbeat and does pretty well in guiding you through the exercises, letting you know that you should take a break if you need it, not to work through pain, etc. It's a good deal for the price. I'm satisfied!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,Mother always said if you have nothing good to say - don't say it. Enough said - don't waste your money purchasing this DVD.
1,"slow shipment, never get the item","I have ordered the item 15 days before but the item is still not shipped. Very slow process, very bad service."
1,color is not matching,"I ordered one Sterling color. When I received it, it is not the same color showing on the website. The color I got is like the dentist uniform...... be aware of this product. Amazon want me pay the return shipping myself."
1,What the.....,"With one visit to Hell On Earth's website, you can see that these guys are not all there. Putting aside the publicity stunt of a assisted suicide during an upcomming show in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, they also ""perform"" acts like sodomizing skinned cattle, and putting rats in blenders and drinking the mixture. Need I say more? Do not support these clowns. Their music sounds like a poor man's NIN and their get-ups look like cheap halloween costumes. Get a f'n life."
1,This is music?,"Has anyone tried to listen to the lyrics? These guys make Godsmack look like philosophers. It's such a shame they received so much publicity for their suicide stunt, because they'll probably profit from it in the long run, even if it doesn't go on, because of the name recognition they have already received. Okay, so if this is their attempt to support a legitimate social cause, what was the cause that sodomizing skinned calves supports? Is raping sheep the next step to show support for anthrax awareness?"
1,"I'd give them a big ""0"" if I could","What a terrible band. This music is not just talentless, uninspired crap. It's much worse! I am so glad that I didn't pay money for this stuff. I really hope nobody else does either, because they don't deserve a dime. It's no wonder they have to resort to extreme measures to support their band. The music won't ever get them fame or money, so they must resort to performing ""acts"" on dead animals and suicides. What a joke."
1,All things very disturbing and Sick,This band may have jumped the shark before even gaining the popularity they crave.Their move to perform a show containing a live assisted suicide IS nothing more than a marylin manson wannabe attempt to turn some heads.Although I have not lost hope in society these medeocre musicians have shown me that there are still sick people out there.Jarod Robertson-21
1,Just say no to drugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"At first I was at a loss for words to describe how evil, twisted, sick, etc. this band was. But, the truth is, they are to be pitied even more than their fans. Through drug abuse, they have destroyed any brain cells they may have had, many many years ago. HYPOTHETICALLY, if this band laughably tried to maintain they don't use drugs--which I highly doubt they could or would do (maintain they don't use drugs)--then, the only explanation for their embarrassing bids for attention can be an astoundingly LOW IQ. No talent WHATSOEVER AND NO INTELLIGENCE EITHER. Hell on Earth: You are a joke--a sadly transparent product of drugs, low/no intelligence, and a pitiful attempt to amount to something...anything. Can you say D E S P E R A T E? That's okay, you will eventually get what is coming to you. In prison, I think you'll enjoy being sodomized (and hopefully skinned, too, like the calves in your show). You will not be missed. Bye bye."
1,BUNCH Of sadistic trash,Anyone who'd have a real live suicide to promote a CD has to suck. The only way they get people to hear them is by breaking laws and killing people. I agree with the Thai guy's review from above.
3,The Band,"This cd is mediocre, but i dont think its right to give a band a bad rating because of their live shows. we are reviewing the cd here, and not what they do."
1,Crap,"Aweful music, pathetic attempts at looking evil, and disgusting members. This band is just ridiculous. Don't waste your money!!"
5,Can't wait for more!,"This second installment of the Starshield series is a stunning achievement. Now that the reader is familiar with the nature of the Starshield universe one can fully appreciate the story.While not as well known as Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance saga, this series has all the promise of being as epic on a stellar level.The secrets revealed in the final pages of this book are such that I cannot wait to read the third installment. Unfortunately, I have heard no news of the next book being written. It would be a shame to kill the series on such a power and gripping novel.I highly recommend this book."
1,Not for me,"Almost everything has some sort of bad effect on me, and this does as well. Using it made me feel tired."
3,"Not bad, but....","The music, the quality of production is very nice! I have issues with some of the ""nature"" sounds. The cricketts and chirping you hear is way too loud. The running water is fine but everything else is too obtrusive to enjoy this CD. Also the ""chanting you hear sounds more like just moaning."
5,a great assistant Massage therapists,"This book is very helpful to the massage therapist. It helps with having a short description of the disease, what strokes to use, and the best way to position the body, and a rough idea of how often you should give the client a massage"
5,Great reference,"The version I recieved is a hard back and the one's I saw at the store were spiral bound. No really issue. Used it many time since recieving it. Great reference, don't know how I survived without it."
5,Excellent Reference,Excellent reference material...easy to find Pathology. As a praactitioner I do not work on medical cases at this time but find this manual a must...it is informative.
3,GREAT INFO!! JUST STEP UP YOUR LYRICS ALOT!!!,"U-GOD must understand that no matter what he spits he has been the weak link of the WU bottom line. Until HE can inspire 1st rate rappers on his own(Rakim,Kane,Eminem,Jay-Z etc)he will get the ""low totem pole"" treatment because he doesn't really challenge the listener lyrically. He bounces off his co- mc's alright but that's all he has counted on. The people who bought his disc(200K) did so thinkin' they were gonna get a true WU project and he did'nt deliver the goods so when the record label realised they had a stale project at best, they got out while the gettin' was good. I give this a ""C"". Thanks!!!I liked how he shared his upbringin' as a real momma's boy and his allegiance to certain members but It was about 30 minutes too short."
5,Soundtrack to the Series,"Of course you can't fit the entire history of Ausrock onto a couple of CD's, but you can come close. The ABC's Long Way to the Top was a highly interesting and entertaining series chronologically detailing the history of Australian rock and roll right from the Wild One to Silverchair and beyond, and the CD is a fitting companion. Each song has been carefully chosen, and it is good to be able to hear the evolution of the music from the 50's up until today in the space of a few hours. Naturally there are going to be gaps and some good tunes left out, however it is still a wicked and worthy addition to any music lover's collection."
1,MUSIC LOVERS BEWARE,"The eight cuts on this CD have not been previously released, TRANSLATION; they aren't the versions we know from his early career. CAUTION: 4 OF THE CUTS ARE IN SPANISH INCLUDING STEAL AWAY AND HOT ROD HEARTS!!! Don't waste your $$$$."
3,will not be on my xmas list,My bunny did not care for this at all and refused to play with it but it does look cute.
1,Unoriginal,"As a professor of Naturopathic medicine I find Dr. Baum's attempt at unifying other researcher's work offensive. The references do not point to any original contribution to the information by the author.I always recommend to my students that in the field of Naturopathic Medicine we have to be very careful of our sources of information, and I would recommend that one not waste their money on this book."
2,Poorly composed and edited.,"Preparing for a trip to Mexico I focused on this book only to find that it was poorly composed. The irritations I had were:1. Many of the chapters were not picked to be of as much use as I would like: e.g., Camping, A Trip by Train, The Beauty Shop, The Shoemaker and the Optometrist. 2. A dictionary is a separate book but it doesn't have all of the words that are in the Learn Spanish lesson book. 3. There is no index for being able to go back to certain words or grammatical subjects when you wish to refresh your memory. 4. The pages in the back of the book are supposed to be used for ""flash cards"", having a question on the front of them and supposedly the answer on the back of the flash card, but most of the flash cards have answers on the back that correspond to questions on one of the other flash cards, which makes most of them unusable. The pictures are useful but not particularly well done. Overall I was very disappointed."
1,Learn Spanish The Fast And Easy Way 3rd Ed. w/CDs,I did not like this book. You can't use the cds in your car. The book skips around and doesn't interpret the sentences the cds read to you. I bought this book for a Spanish 2 class. The teacher didn't even end up liking the book after reviewing it more. This would be a good book to use as a refresher before a trip to Mexico. I don't recommend it to someone wanting to learn Spanish.
4,Pretty Good for a Start,"I am taking private lessons with a teacher, and he recommended this book. It is pretty good, and I like the way that the more complex subjects, such as verbs and conjugations, are introduced gradually so that it is easier to absorb. Most of the exercises, though, are extremely simplistic. If you are a raw beginner to learning languages, this book will be fine."
4,satisfied spanish teacher,my only gripe is that this book uses spanish synonyms without teaching them. in the middle of a sentence they use desear instead of querer and andar instead of caminar which totally confused my students looking ahead. other than that it is a great book!
1,This book doesn't teach the Spanish language,"I'm sorry I bought this book. It's a glitzy, disjointed mess of cartoons with no organization or thought given to the basics of Spanish grammar. At best it serves only one good purpose--it gives you questions to ask in Spanish if you plan on going to Spain or Latin America as a tourist. But the terms are impossible to remember or recall because you really are not learning the basics of Spanish grammar,and for that reason you cannot logically put together a cogent thought in Spanish. The author asks you to practice phases, phrases you will not remember--the text does not flow, and most of the time yo have no idea where you are going.My preference is ""Easy Spanish Step-by Step"". It's a well organized text whre the author actually speaks to her students, and at the same time she makes you feel that you are learning the language and not treated like a tourist in a AAA office looking for a book of Spanish phrases"
2,Hello = Buenos dias?,"I just started this book and right in the beginning, on page 1. It says Buenos dias (Hello)Hello is Hola, Buenos dias is Good morning. I was confused so I had to ask my spanish friend.This small mistake made me distrust this book. I do not want to call my spanish friend every time this book makes a mistake.Also, the book translates 'Me' as 'My' and 'Mis' as My' as well. which is right?Well, I had to look up the dictionary to find out.I'm sure there are many great contents but I'm not going to keep studying with this book."
4,helpful,helpful. Taking a spanish class at church. Need to repeat the class.Foreign language doesn't come easy to me. thanks
3,CD's Useless!,"I am taking a class and this is the book the instructor is using; for that purpose the book is great. I bought a 2nd copy of the book in order to obtain the audio cds. My expectation was that I could go back thru lessons and review what I learned using the cds. Unfortunately the cd's do not ""teach""; the cd's consist of solely of voices speaking only the spanish words shown in the book. The cd's aren't even very helpful for learning pronunciation because the speakers are speaking too fast. So, I would recommend the book if you are using it in a classroom setting but don't bother searching for a version that includes the cd's; it's a waste of money. You'll be able to find a copy without the cd's for much less than one with the cd's. Bueno Suerte!"
3,Not what I'd hoped,"This book is pretty general and its sections are broken up into newborn, 0-3 months, 4-7 months and so on. What I wanted was a book that talked about each month individually since baby's change and develop so much so quickly. This book is just too general for me. It does have good info, just not as much as I'd like."
3,Just okay,"Published about 10 years ago. The information is okay, but I wish I had bought something more recent."
4,Fabulous Resource,"This book really is helpful. There are so many books out there for each week and month of pregnancy, but I couldn't find a really good one for childhood. This one is really great. It is detailed (doesn't just say ask your pediatrician) and brings up a lot of stuff that I never would have thought of. The only drawback is that the index is a little screwy. It is not always a hundred percent accurate. It is easy to work around it though."
5,Great No-Nonsense Reference,"If you're cradling a crying baby in one arm and you need a straightforward answer about baby's health RIGHT NOW, this is absolutely the book you want to have within reach. It's got a great index and extensive information about childcare and infant health. Parents on a budget will appreciate its recommendations about what baby equipment is necessary vs. what's optional -- you can get away with less than you'd think -- and any parent will appreciate the clear advice on what symptoms to watch for and when to call the doctor. Since this book is a broad-based reference, some subjects don't get in-depth treatment; for example, breastfeeding mothers may want to check outThe Nursing Mother's Companion: Revised Editionor another breastfeeding reference in addition to the breastfeeding information presented in this book. That said, almost every baby-related subject is at least touched on, and this book is a great resource to check out the answer to almost any question."
4,"Good, practical information","I agree that this book has an agenda and does not acknowledge some of the newer theories on parenting. However, it does contain some very good, practical advice on how to care for a newborn. The section on breast-feeding, for example, is quite helpful. For the price, you certainly can't go wrong with this book."
4,1st yr,"Great resource, easy to read, gives a nice idea of milestones for my son.It's organized nicely. All in all a good resource."
1,Outdated,"This book has outdated information regarding circumcision. A natural, intact penis is easier to care for than a bloody, traumatized one. The authors need to release an updated version that takes into account that half of baby boys born today are left whole, and those parents need correct, up to date information regarding care of the intact penis...which is basically ""leave it alone."""
2,Outdated Information,I just had my third baby and got this book as a freebie. It is if it was written thirty years ago. Outdated in my opinion.
5,Only book you'll need,"My daughter's pediatrician gave me this book at my New Mom appointment before she was born. It helped me out a lot. I recommend this book to anybody. It has all the information you need. In my experience, it covered ALL of my questions. It's the only book you'll need."
5,Exactly what we needed,"To keep it simple, this book was an easy read with plenty of detail on what to expect for the first year and how to handle even the simple things such as ""swaddling"" a baby and diaper changes. As we are expecting our first child, this book will be shelved for quick reference and I'm sure, several re-reads. I appreciated the no-nonsense and non-judgmental approach when reading information on feeding (breast vs formula) and sleeping (co-sleeping vs crib/bassinet) of our newborn."
5,Complete and accurate.... very usefull,Very complete and accuarate information. I was amazed when all the symptoms described in the book were manifested on the baby.
1,baby's first year,"I sent this book to my daughter-in-law and she said the book was nasty and that it smelled, we threw it out.. very disappointed."
4,Yodeling Wieners!,Heard the Yodeling Wiener song on Sirius Broadway's Bests 77 and almost had a car accident from laughing so much while listening and driving. If the rest of this CD is one-half as funny then it would have well earned at least 4 stars. When will it be available????
4,classical bassey,"Shirley Bassey sings updated versions of her greatest hits accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra. This album presents Shirley in a more understated manner than normal ,under the inspired backing of the LSO. It presents an interesting comparison to the original versions of the songs as it gives them a more classical feel.A recommended addition to your Bassey collection, or as simply a collection of memorable songs by one of the great pop divas who has stood the test of time for almost 50 years."
5,One of the Great Recordings of Progressive Music,"This album is simply one of the best recordings made by a ""rock"" group (hard to categorize!), ever. Very original compositional work, with wonderful, virtuosic performances from each of the members. It is a tragedy that this group is no longer together. Their other recordings are excellent as well, but this one is the gem."
5,Showcasing guitar prodigy Armik,"Romantic Dreams is the ninth music CD recording showcasing guitar prodigy Armik -- who has also incorporated his love of flamenco scales in his outstanding and flawlessly recorded performances. An adventurous experiment in expressing the feeling of romantic love by mixing elements of Latin, flamenco, and jazz into a luminous whole, Romantic Dreams is a treasure to listen to and share. The individual tracks comprising Romantic Dreams include Moments (4:57), Fantasia (4:37), Slow Dancing (4:41), Secret Whispers (5:07), Moonlight Cafe (4:43), Love Letters (5:13), Treasure Island (4:36), Your Touch (5:12), Ocean Breeze (4:35), Amor (2:54), and the title piece, Romantic Dreams (4:51)."
3,It's ok music,"This is an ok album, but it's not as well as Aldo's ""Close to You"" cd album. I was looking for the best Spanish guitar music to relax too, but this one is a bit too loud for me. Sorry!"
4,very nice,Purchased this for my wife for Valentines Day and she loved it. So do our children. Very romantic and uplifting music from an outstanding guitar player! Makes me want to give up trying to play :). I will definitely buy more albums from Armik.
5,"Pure baroque, pure pleasure.","Again Telemann is full of surprises. And the Appolo's Fire ensemble is elegant and colorfull. No agressivity at all in this joyfull programm. The Overture Burlesque, for string ensemble,is one of the most beautifull music of Telemann i have ever heard! The first movement of this suite is so moving of noble emotion, that i have repeat this track a lot of time. Highly recommanded!"
3,A comparison of Social Sector vs Business Sector challenges,"""Good to Great and the Social Sectors"" claim that the ""Good to Great"" concepts are applicable to social sectors too, with little or no modification. Jim compares and contrasts the difference in challenges between business sector & social sector. The amount of research done to substantiate the material is less when compared to the original ""Good to Great"". However, the facts presented are convincing enough.Reading ""Good to Great"" is a pre-requisite for this book. You would not be able to fully appreciate the material without reading ""Good to Great"". I would recommend this book for leaders of non-profit organizations."
3,Good maybe not great,The book seemed to have info I need but I had trouble trying to figure out out to implement the ideas of the book into my situation.
3,Solid,Timely delivery. Quality product. Happy about turnout and purchase. Thank you - greatly appreciate it.
1,This is only one side of the answer,"I agree that there is a need for greatness, but stating that business thinking is not the answer??? Yes in the non-profit and government sectors there is no profit. But to go from Good To Great you still need to follow business practices. This book is is really talking about the organization behavior. With the US having an economy that is based in a monetary system you can't ignore the fact that in any organization there will be a need to take business process and money into consideration. I would have given this a high review if the author stated that there is another side to the story."
4,Good companion for the main book,"This is a very good companion to the Good to Great book. However, you really need to read the first book to truly understand this one. As someone working in the public sector for a not-for-profit, this book made more sense than G2G alone. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone in the nonprofit sector. Stay focused. Remember your hedgehog."
3,Not What I Meant to Order,I did not read the description thoroughly and order this thinking I was ordering the actual book -- Good to Great.
3,Read the original first,"The monograph is valuable only when the 5 key business concepts are well understood before trying to extrapolate them to the non-profit world. I gave just the mono to my staff and they wound up asking all kinds of questions that the Good to Great book addresses well, albeit with for profit examples."
4,Important research Info,"I'm retired from the USG and working for a Management Consulting Company, that has recently developed a Public Leadership Institute. I ordered and read Good to Great and the 35 page supplement for the Public Sector (selection above) which I found very helpful in our efforts to develope concepts for our leadership training curriculum. Collins and his staff did an admirable job of research to support the identification of excellent leadership qualities that can elevate an organization from mediocre to great."
4,Good to Great & Strategic Planning,"We used the Monograph as a precursor to our strategic planning process. It was very helpful in generating a shared vocabulary for the planning process. As a companion for non-profits to the book ""Good to Great,"" it is easy to grasp and answers many questions left open in the book. It is even a good stand-alone read for non-profit leaders, although reading both books is the best way to get the most out of the concepts. As a non-profit theater, this book is a great tool to lead us in journey towards excellence."
3,"Good, but not great.","I think that this monograph is useful material for public sector, non-profit, or secular organizations. It presents some useful points that extend the Good to Great concepts to organizations that are not profit-driven.My largest complaint is that the current price is not consistent with the amount of material. Good to Great is an excellent value, while this additional monograph is roughly a single additional chapter at over half the price."
2,Overpriced,"As a federal employee, I bought this supplement to the ""Good to Great"" which is the favorite book of the head of my agency--he mentions the book in every single email he sends out. I am enjoying the book, but this monograph is severely overpriced and short. I think $3.95 would be a fair price, but $9 is way too much."
4,"Terrific, in-depth look at a legendary football program.","This is definitely a must-have for all Sooner fans. It is probably the most comprehensive text one can have concerning the OU football program. It traces the entire history, from its humble beginnings to the powerhouse it has become.The only reason I have given it four stars instead of five is because it was published in 1995, which any Sooner fan will tell you is not one of the program's best periods. Because of this, there is no mention of Stoops or the 7th national championship in 2000. I consider the last 10 years to be a significant chunk of OU history that is absent from this book. But other than that, it's an easy read and a great buy."
5,Gift,It was absolutely perfect as a gift; well written; great photos. I think I will order another for a gift.
3,"Good book, images could be better","A great book with fantastic old shots and nice descriptions. The modern day photos are not as high quality as it should be and they could have done a better job trying to capture the same angles. The book is pre-Big Dig finale, so it does not include any updates of the R. Kennedy Greenway and you see some Big Dig construction in the modern photos. All in all, a nice book rich in history."
1,Boston for the Time-Pressed and Vapid,"If Boston were a lengthy work of great scholarship, ""Boston Then and Now"" would be the Cliff Notes. And were you to rely upon them come examination time, you would be failed for having a trite and simplistic understanding of the weighty tome you had been asked to master. This is essentially a series of photos of Boston neighborhoods and vistas taken way back then ... followed by photos of the same neighborhoods and vistas taken now. Get it? Then ... and Now! Photo pairs are accompanied by fortune-cookie length observations that only a primate would find edifying. True Bostonians will find this book every bit as delightful as Game Six of the 1986 World Series."
5,Best comfort & safety while traveling,"This harness fits my dogs very well and has a long enough tether to allow them to sit and stand comfortably but not get down out of the seat. When we get out, I hook their lead on the ring and just unsnap and leave the tether in the car. I have 4 in various sizes and hook multiple dogs on one seat belt by running the seat belt thru the adjustable loop. You could use this harness as their regular harness!"
2,I've definitely eaten better!,The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant. I thought it was not fresh tasting. The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only. Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash.
2,Disappointing,"I fell in love with marzipan while in Spain, and was hoping to experience it again state-side. This marzipan was way too sweet, while lacking the depth of flavor we'd come to expect. I will not purchase it again."
3,Brand doesn't taste as good as it used to,"I'm a long time fan of Biermann marzipan candies and when I bought a box the other day, I was disappointed with the taste and wondered if they changed their recipe since last year. While the candies were fresh (not dried out), the almond taste wasn't very noticeable and they had a bit of a tang to them. I probably won't buy this brand again unless they go back to making it with a strong almond flavor like it had before."
3,2 Sweet n Almondy,"I purchased this product today from TJ Maxx. They just got it in, and it was only $5.99 so I thought I'd give it a try. It was a bit too sweet and it tasted of almond extract instead of the natural gentle taste of real almonds. My sister in law always brings the most delightful marzipan from Peru when she visits. I hoped that this marzipan would be similar, but it wasn't. Although it wasn't perfect, it was still good. Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't throw it in the trash--I nibbled until I ate the whole box. It's also true that the fruit shapes are only painted on top--it's flat on the back."
5,Fabulous Marzipan,I've lived in Europe--and I know good marzipan. This was the best. It is calling YOU! Get some--you won't regret it. AG
5,New edition,"For a long time I was looking for this book, because the author is the first is one of the first Western physicians who has seriously studied Ayurvedic medicine: actually he studied his career in India . Anyway, the book I was looking was the Penguin edition of 1992, becausa I was unaware that there was a new edition. The edition I bought recently has a more convenient format, as it is not Pocket, yet it is very well priced."
5,The Best Introduction to Ayurveda Out There,Excellent introduction to the subject by one of the foremost practitioners and teachers of Ayurveda in the western world. highly recommended
4,"Great footage, facts","The most striking part of this documentary to me was the footage that they were able to get a hold of which was truly amazing. Even those who have seen numerous similar titles and shows I think will be impressed. It was well done and provided a good base in facts for the interested viewer who wants to understand the present conflict in the middle east. I felt that it didn't delve too deeply into understanding each side's motives, but I think the idea is just to display the facts and leave it to the viewer. Overall I recommend it to those who would like to learn more about the situation."
4,Worth getting,"The ""chatty"" discussions cover most aspects of having twins in a calm and ""been there"" tone. It calmly discusses things usually left out of singleton birth books, such as what happens in NICU and how to handle premature babies at home. It also prepares you for the day to day things like how to deflect gawkers when shopping, how to handle prolongued fatigue and how to encourage the twins' individuality"
3,Raising Twins book,Another good book on raising twins. It is a little dated but advice still is good and helpful.
4,Fills in the gaps,I found this short work very practical and useful in trying to recreate the immigrant ancestors' experience. It answers many of my questions about travel and transportation in our early American history. Well worth the price of this research aid.
5,....can't breathe....BWAH HAA HAAA,Too Funny! Had to shut it off 10 minutes into it because I was laughing so hard I couldn't finish getting ready for work. The imagery he creates puts you right there in the parachute harness with him and sharing his pain.
5,Congested Whales are just part of the fun!,"Yes, if you have ever been pushed over the edge by 'cosmic tubular' dudes this is the CD for you! I got interested in Bill by listening to Jeff Foxworthy CDs. Since then I have grabbed up pretty near all of Bill CDs. They are all great, do yourself a favor and catch a few of Bill performances yourself."
5,"Oh, to save the ocean!","""I's a dorkfish!"" My favorite Bill Engvall CD! The first time I heard this CD was at my brothers' house Thanksgiving weekend 1999, and I loved it, especially the parts about the weather, the dorkfish, and more ""Here's Your Sign"" gags. I picked myself up a copy eventually. Last Thanksgiving I played this CD in my Mom's car as we were driving between Bay City and Traverse, and she laughed so hard at the T-Ball one that she cried! One of the reasons why it's my favorite Bill Engvall CD is because it's the longest! That Bill is a genius!"
3,chipmunk in the audience,"This was a fun CD, but there is a person in the live audience with possibly the worst laugh I have ever heard, and she thinks it's hysterical!! The material is good, but oh boy, that woman was having a way better time than anyone. One of the bits was repeated; with a song this time, but still the same bit; and oh Lord, the same chipmunk laughing. Listen at your peril, it's pretty good if you can ignore the background noises!"
3,Dorkfish,"Well Bill Engvall is always funny...enough said. I definitely would've prefered a CD over a cassette, but not a bad price."
1,Very dumb,"I don't understand how people said this was a great CD. I liked Bill's original work with the ""Here's your sign"" stories, but this CD is really, really bad. I did not laugh out loud at all."
2,Messiah/Jacobs,"My favorite recordings are conducted by Mr.Jacobs. I love them. I can't get enough of them. I think they are outstanding, so I rushed to get his version of Messiah. What a disappointment! There's no beauty in his rendition. I didn't like:-His interpretation.-The orchestra sound (It seems to be a very small ensemble)-The unfamiliar voices-The recording sound. (It should've been recorded in a cathedral setting)Please Mr.Jacobs, stick to opera, field in which you excel. (""Giulio Cesare"", ""Rinaldo"", etc.). Leave the Oratorios to the English conductors."
5,Incredible,"Her voice is amazing. Maybe tomorrow should be top ten. Nice Kiwi production. A hit in New Zealand, the rest of the world needs to catch up!"
5,Excellent Mellow Tunes,"I bought this album after becoming familiar with only one track (Track #1; Maybe Tomorrow), only to discover that ALL the tracks are as good if not better than this one. This is an excellent album and I would recommend to anyone. I'm not sure exactly what genre to put it into - probably mellow rock/pop. The lead singer is female and she has a great voice and all the songs have excellent melodic (is that a word?!) tunes."
3,I was hoping for something a little better.,"This album isn't terrible, but it wasn't what I was expecting. It's more goth than it is industrial, and the songs are kind of blase. The female vocalist sounds kinda like Gitane Dimone of Christian Death, and the guitars are same ol' same ol'. However, despite a few complaints, there are a couple cool tracks, but I wouldn't give the whole album any more than three stars just because this style of rock music has been done better by many other bands. The album cover is better than the actual album."
3,Good for kids & high schoolers,"Nice book, but a little light for an in-depth study of biomass. Good for kids and high schoolers."
5,Arrived promptly and seem to work just fine,"Arrived promptly and seem to work just fine, can't comment on battery life yet since I just installed it in my watch."
5,It is a battery,It is a battery. What can I say other than this battery is what it is and works as stated
1,Butterfield 8 - PAN AND SCAN!!!!!,"TCM has been putting out these four-bys of different actresses and actors. I liked getting some of these old classics that way. I already own Doris Day for instances. So with great anticipation I purchased this one. I checked the box to make sure the films were presented in their original aspect ratio. The box said yes they are. Well, surpise, surprise Butterfied 8 is modified to fit my screen (which is a HD 62 widescreen.) So, here I have a CinemaScope movie in the dreaded Pan & Scan. I wrote TCM about it and their reply was: ""You didn't buy it from us, so too bad."" In other words unless you buy it directly from TCM they do not stand behind their products. It is not like Wall-Mart put the wrong DVD in the box.So, be careful - DON'T BUY THIS SET!!!I'm now worried about any other TCM products since they have no customer service."
3,"Yes, but ...","Dickens meets Delderfield. The first two-thirds of this sprawling novel, which covers most of the 19th century, easily holds one's interest. However, the momentum begins to slow in the final third as the original characters begin to make room for their children and then their grandchildren and, yes, then their great-grandchildren. As another reviewer pointed out, a family-tree of characters would have been most helpful. If you're fond of multi-generational family sagas -- the sort of book you can really lose yourself in -- then ""The Tontine"" may be just what you're looking for. Be sure, however, that you have plenty of time to devote to it because it does tend to go on and on. And on."
5,Tontine Fan,"I tried to climb Mt. Hood with Phil. He was a member of the Mazamas and a skilled guide to have in our grouop of 4. But the weather was against us so we gave up. I loaned Phil my copy of the 2 volume story ""THE TONTINE"". Phil was in poor health from a car accident and died before I got my book back.50 years later I find the book at Amazon. I have thoroughly enjoyed rereading this fabulous story of the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and the waneing days of the slsve trade. It was worth waiting for!"
2,Squeegee review,"Hi. This is a good unit, BUT, like the previous review stated, the rubberhead requires A LOT of pressure on the head due to stiffness to removethe moisture. It places considerable pressure on the bottle top andsqueegee head, causing it to split. Had less than a year, a great conceptwith the two together, but they need to improve durability. Thanks.Paul"
4,Very effective when enough pressure is applied,I really like it. The only thing I have a problem with is that the rubber part is a little stiff and a great deal of pressure needs to be applied in order to clear the cleanser off the glass. For me it takes 2 hands which can be awkward sometimes. Maybe it can be softened up somehow.
3,Nice to see these again,"While all of the episodes are here and complete, they are out of order as others have pointed out. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing these in color way back when I was a kid. A little grainy and soft at times but where else are you going to be able to see these? If you want to see Diver Dan again then this set does deliver."
5,Diver Dan Volume 1 & 2,"I received the DVDs promptly and in perfect shape. The quality of the video is the best it could be. I haven't watched most of it yet, so I can't say anymore. I am happy with the process with Amazon."
3,interesting if a bit academic,"interesting account if a bit dry and academic. led me to Wallace Stegner's ""Wolf Willow"" which is richer with anecdotes and better writing. also led me to ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" which is a must-read for any Jefferson-loving American. all three titles made me interested in the lives of the Indians before 1800: was their life as brutal when the enemy was other tribes rather than white goldseekers, homesteaders et al? or were they at peace with the earth and each other?"
3,get this game only for the controller,"if you're a music game fan and is willing to import a asian ps2, then this game's only use to you is the dj controller, basicly been the only thing better then the Japanese counterparts. basicly a bad port over on konami's part. it using the Beatmania IIDX 9th style theme, recolored and textured with ugly purple layering that doesn't work.my advice get this game/control, toss the game and head to play asia or ebay and buy yourself Beatmania IIDX Empress,DJ Troopers,Gold,Distoried,Happy Sky,or red"" hell even the older mixes are better then this us port. from 10th style to 3rd. on my oppenion. so this has been your music game expert, chris and that's all for now."
1,can't play the game,"This game did not come with a controller, and you can't find the controller anywere - not even on Amazon. This was a waste of money, as you can't really play the game without the controller."
4,Message - 'The Dawn Anew Is Coming' (Bacillus),"German progressive / psych band's first (out of seven) album - originally released in 1972. until recently, I was vaguely even aware of this group. Tunes here that make this CD a keeper are the eight-minute title track ""The Dawn Anew Is Coming"" {liked the several changes in tempo and mood}, the quite 1972-ish jamming & well-played ""When I'm Home"" and ""Heaven Knows"". Personnel: Billy Tabbert - guitar & vocals, Allan Freeman - synthesizer & vocals, Allan Murdoch - guitar, Horst Stachelhaus - bass, Tom McGuigan - mellotron, woodwinds & vocals and Gunther Klinger - drums. Might appeal to (I'm second guessing) fans of Quatermass, Nektar or possibly Nosferatu."
1,Peaceful,"This is a great cd in words, horrible in singing. This guy's like Paul McCartney. His painting a bunch of buckets of paint on a wall. This guy's music is a bunch of noise mixed into this thing that makes rap sound like gospel music. He stinks at boxing, cooking (just look at the guy), and everything else! This is a failiure of a sellout. If you think this is the chef of all time, get this cd."
1,Confused??,"While I appreciate the work put into this particular deck, I am curious as to why no one else has mentioned, or questioned the insertion of the ""Chakras"" into Native American Spirituality//Shamanism. The last I understood, the Chakras are of an eastern bent..(Hinduism) and nothing to do with Native American Religion // Spirituality. I'm having a time wrapping my mind around that one."
4,Lattices,"This is a wonderfully understated deck of cards. The colours are earthy, reflecting the basis of shamanic understanding that is presented here: the interlocking world of plant, animal, tree, season, stone and sky, grounded in native American wisdom. The cards are quietly subtle; they invite us to get a sense of the structure of our lives, the moments and points of ntersection. They remind us life is a journey where every step has its choice of direction and consequences.We can beocme mindful of those steps, knowing, too, the wisdom of the other worlds is always present. This is a powerful deck, quietly illustrated, linking us to the latticed loop of life."
5,Shaman's Deck,"Since i received this deck , I've worked with it daily. I've grown a close affinity for it and reading the outcomes. I'm very pleased and have already recommended it to many of my friends.Thanks."
1,This is NOT a tribute -- it's a mess,"Choosing to cover Annie Lennox is brave enough, but to call this ""tribute"" album, as the liner notes do here, ""beautiful (and) soulful"" is downright impudent. The vocals are weak and anything but soulful, and the music is generic synthesizer. What The Divine Rhythm, the group credited with 11 of the 12 tracks fail to realize is that Annie Lennox (as solo artist and half of Eurythmics) always mixed real soul with real music and not just synthesizers. Some of the singers don't even get the lyrics correct. The song selection is strange as well. The CD claims to ""revisit the music from Lennox from each stage of her career,"" but the songs included here come from only six of Lennox's 13 albums. Of course, there's no reason to think that other songs would have been performed better. This is one of the worst CDs I've ever purchased."
1,Annie Lennox performed by Miss Piggy,"This CD is a shame, whoever is singing (I think it's Miss Piggy) is shameless about imitating Ms. Lennox, needless to say that it is just impossible. Please don't waste your money on this...."
5,One of the best ever!,"Queen Live At Wembley ranks right up there any of the greatest live albums of all time. In my opinion, the same level as Eagles Live, Kiss Alive I & II, etc... As a live band, Queen takes a back seat to nobody! Also recommend buying the dvd Live At Wembley. It'll be one of the greatest things you'll ever see or hear! Promise!"
4,The seek for enlightenment,"This book is a compilation of stories from people who had a near death experience. These people reveal who we really are. We are some sort of living energy or light. Knowing who we are eases our sufferings. We can communicate with our Source as who He really is, we can find our gifts to heal or to read minds, we will not be afraid of death, we will understand the role of every living things in the universe. This is inspirational and helpful for people who lose their love one, people with suicidal tendency, rape victims, alcoholic, prisoners, and other sufferings. However, knowing who we are has consequences. Most people refuse to accept the TRUTH and so people with near death experiences decided to keep silent. This is a GOOD NEWS of the 21st century. Dr. Ring collected their stories and keep them anonymous."
3,They probably shouldn't have interrupted the broadcast!,"I was pretty much disappointed in this book. The other reviews I read were the sole reason for my purchase of the book, however, upon reading it, it did not live up to my expectations. The book isn't horrible, but I didn't find it to be as funny and charming as I would have liked. The characters are pretty cut and dried and after the first couple of chapters you already know what you can expect from them for the rest of the book.I think the author has promise but still needs some work on how to give depth to the characters keep the reader interested."
2,Sweet But,"This is a sweet book, but simple - not very well written. My 10 month old never really took to it and he loves books.... I do love her other books however."
2,"Outdated, bad advice, nice pictures however","I bought this book thinking it might make a good companion text for an Adult-ed course I am developing. The technical advice it contains is out-of-date and I'm not sure it ever made sense in the first place. It has beautiful illustrations for things like ""how to upgrade your monitor"" (answer: ""buy a new one""). I give the book two stars because the pictures are so pretty, but if you have a Pentium II with 32 Meg of RAM running Windows ME you don't want to upgrade, you want to replace it with a new computer. A nicely illustrated book with sensible advice like ""donate your old computer to charity"" or ""take it the dump"" wouldn't be worth the price of this book, but at least it would correct."
4,Great Buy!,"When I first receive this watch, I was a bit taken back by the large luminous bars. This being a ladies watch, I was exepecting something more dainty. But the overall looks of this watch grew on my spouse, and she began to like it more and more as she wore it as her daily watch.The build quality is solid and it kept accurate time. It goes well with any attire that my female better half put on.A great buy that I would recommend."
2,High expectations unfulfilled but fun to read,"I had high expectations about this book as a Mets fan. After all, the title says it all. Although I enjoyed reading it (a fast and easy read), I was taken aback by some of the poor research and mistakes. Most notably, the author blames Bob Ojeda for the tragic boat accident that claimed the lives of Tim Crews and Steve Olin. Bob Ojeda,who suffered from survivor's guilt for years, was not driving as stated by the author; and the only reason he didn't have his head taken off was that he was slouched down in his seat on the boat (having your head scalped is not a minor injury Mr. Liebenthal). The facts of that tragic night are so well known, it makes one wonder why the author would go beyond emblishment and venture into possible libel merely to smear a beloved Met. Read this book only as a guide and to bring back some memories, but don't rely on it for facts or accuracy. There are better sources."
2,Loud and wavy,"I returned my Banshee stereo. It sure was loud, however the music seemed to wave in and out. You cannot charge your iPOD either. There is no remote. There is no battery compartment - not portable at all. There are many other choices for less price. Save your money and look for something else."
2,"Nice, but. . .","it should be called ""snap, crackle, pop"". I'm told the constant crackling sounds with certain ""tones"" is interference from other devices. So this would be great if you lived in a home without anything electronic running near it. And I could totally be wrong, but I've lived in two homes with this thing and both places it makes the terrible crackling sound. Not only that, but you can't adjust anything. . it has to be plugged in and there's no recharge capability for your Mp3 player. Save your money and look elsewhere, in my humble opinion."
2,"Crackle, pop and wavy sound!","I completely agree with some of the prior negative reviews. This system does snap, crackle and pop (and it has nothing to do with other electronics) unless you are talking about anything else plugged in. With significant treble in the music you will hear the system pop, so most rock is immediately out. Gaming wise, I haven't had any problem with the midi reproduction.Overall, however, there is a wavy output which I find rather annoying. I am not an audiophile by any stretch; but I do notice a surge in music as I listen to my iPods playback. This may have to do with the AC current from the bulky adapter. Why not supply a direct current?? It pretty much steps down your 110VAC to 12 VAC. That is why some say it is not too portable. Sitting on the desktop, it looks pretty good, I think. Hope this helps"
4,"runts...thought I was ordering more for the money, but could have done better locally without paying shipping costs","We were looking for a good price for runts as we have a candy business and placed an order for the runts. I thought I had taken into account the shipping costs, but when we received the package, it definitely was not worth paying the shipping costs for the amount. We could have done better to buy local"
1,Almost good,the banana tastes like dirt. everything else is pretty good. most def don't eat the bananas.they should just replace the banana with mango or some other fruit.
3,Not happy with the shipping,"I was upset when my package came ripped open. The manufacturer shipped my 5 lb. Runts in an envelope. Daaaaa! Who does that? Most companies ship something like this in a box. It doesn't appear that I lost any candy because they did have it in a plastic bag inside the envelope, so that's good. The Runts look to be in good shape. This candy was extremley expensive but I will say that Runts are a great tasting candy."
3,not the original candy!,"The candy was ok. Not great, and not the original (missing the strawberry and blue flavors!) I didn't think the flavors were as good as the originals, either. I am trying to order another listing, that is by 'Runts', to see if it better. The picture on this one is accurate, I hope the new order will be accurate to the picture as well, as it includes the two missing flavors in the picture as well as the original Runts name. Beware, and check it out, I am sorry I missed doing so."
4,"Price feels high, but the candy's good!",Price feels high but I guess that's what it takes to ship candy from the Internet in not-really-bulk compared to larger retailers and distributors. Candy tastes great. Overall I recommend this if you're looking for it.
5,"Bandsaw Blade 1/8""","I have used this blade (and brand) before and knew what I was looking for. It works well on a Craftsman bandsaw and if you try to find it on the shelf at Sears, you are out of luck. I received it much quicker than I would have going through Sears and have already used it. I need 1/8"" size for the work I do and it's nearly impossible to locate except at AMAZON! As it turns out, I'm finding more and more of the ""hard-to-find"" items I need by just going to Amazon first. Very happy with my purchase."
2,buyer beware,"CAsswell-Massey emphasize that they've been in America before it was even a nation, and that all their products are ""made in the USA"". I just bought a rather expensive brush from them and guess what is stamped in the handle? KOREA. I've nothing against foreign goods, butthat is egregious mis-advertizing. Buyer beware!!"
2,A Roman review,Rome is my favorite topic. This book disappointed me. It began quite well and then surprisingly turned into a soap opera type tale. I did not finish this book.
2,33 1/3,BEWARE!people are selling these as if the set is complete. They are not! there should be three books and the one I got was the first book with about 1/3rd of the pages missing. These books are great if you can find a full copy
5,Great for overall heart health and reducing hypertension. Highly Recommend!,"I have been taking Himalaya Arjuna for a few months and recently ran out. I found out that the Herbal HeartCare has Arjuna in it along with many other beneficial herbs. The benefits are really amazing. I take this in conjunction with Jiaogulan and it really does a create job keeping my blood pressure at normal levels. This was an almost impossible task even when I was taking Lisinopril. I cannot describe how pleased I am with Himalaya products. If you are looking for a way to get off the nasty big pharma drugs for blood pressure, this is an excellent place to start!"
3,Looks cheesier than I thought it would.,"I understood this was not a real leather journal, but it looked faker and cheesier than I thought it would. It was a going away gift for my husband before his deployment to Afghanistan and, though he said he liked it, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. He says it is serving it's purpose, and he likes it, so I guess it's ok. Therefor, only 3 stars.Of course, he could be lying to me to save my feelings. He's a good husband that way! 5 stars for him!"
2,Typically Indian non-linear teaching method--give it a pass unless you're a serious student,"I took private lessons with Ms. Kumar for a period in 2006; while she is a sweet lady and quite erudite, her textbook is really more suited as a companion to her private lessons than a general teaching text. Indian thought tends to be much more non-linear than Western paradigms; thus the Western student will likely find the progression of lessons reckless and illogical at best. It does make a handy shelf reference for someone who has studied the language rather deeply and is familiar with Eastern thought processes, being partially arranged in a workbook style."
1,It was a rip off.,It was a rip off. Short. Pointless. I wanted a full academic review. Get the book not the article. Was a waste of money!!
2,Mob Enforcer,"I am glad I did not pay retail price for this rather boring game. The graphics were really bad and the action repetative. There are many other mobster games available, so best to pass on this one."
2,Get this anvil off of me!,"Christopher Pike's ROAD TO NOWHERE is sanctimonious and heavy-handed. It's also boring, which may be an even worse crime in YA fiction. Pike deals with the subject of suicide in several of his books, but nowhere else does he come across as quite so short-sighted or lacking in compassion. ROAD TO NOWHERE is an insult to anyone who has had suicide touch their lives in some way. Pike sacrifices good writing for anvil-dropping, resulting in a sloppy plot that feels secondary to his forced message.I recommend instead these classic Pike novels: MONSTER, SPELLBOUND, GIMME A KISS, LAST ACT, WITCH, SCAVENGER HUNT, and The Last Vampire series."
1,Sucked,"Christopher Pike's ROAD TO NOWHERE is sanctimonious and heavy-handed. It's also boring, which may be an even worse crime in YA fiction. I was expecting a thriller story from Road To Nowhere."
5,THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL SHOCKER!,"I am not a fan of Christopher Pike because in most of his books it starts out good and then toward the middle he goes off subject and start talking about Aliens, Monsters and Outter Space. But this time Chis Pike actually STAYED on subject, and this book was out of this world!The main character Theresa is a run away after finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her best friend. While driving in the rain, Therea spots 2 Hitch Hikers ( Poppy Corn and Freedom Jack) she desides to pick them up (big mistake)... I am not going to tell what else happened in the book because you have to read it yourself.This book really makes you think about Life after Death, Heaven and Hell and Angels and Devils."
5,A great book. One of the best that I have ever read.,This book is great for anyone who loves Christopher Pike books. I've read it many times and I will read it many times more. It has a really surprising ending. I couldn't believe it! But it's something that you could expect from Christopher Pike. I have everyone of his books and I've read all of them. Most of them more than once. I can't wait until he puts out a new book.
1,A FABULOUS intro to floral design!!,"Deborah Dolen's Basic Floral Design book is a versatile and wonderful easy-to-read manual for anyone wanting to create their own floral designs or even those wanting to open a floral business. It is a creative and informative overview of many different types of floral arrangements and a great introduction of what any floral designer should know. Not only does this book apply to real flowers, but it also has great information about silk flowers. With all of Deborah's experience and her background as a successful floral designer, I am so excited to use her expertise to help me on my road to learning more about floral design!"
5,Perfect companion for the videos,"I purchased the videos on floral design by Deborah Dolen, and found them to be fantastic. This book takes the subject more in depth and shows you ways you can really ""wow"" family and friends with floral arrangements. Deborah writes in a clear, easy to follow manner and shares her immense wealth of knowledge regarding design. If you want to learn his to make beautiful floral centerpieces, this is the only book you will need. Love it!"
1,Kindle Format Problems,"This book appears to contain valuable information. However, the format is all wrong. There are portions of text missing (or in the wrong place), some of the pictures are extremely poor quality, and the graphics are out of order. I'm disappointed because I was looking forward to reading this, but it's hard to make sense of the message when the message is jumbled!"
1,should have been proofread before publishing,"I thought it would be fun to learn a little something about arranging flowers. I was looking for a book to get some basic information from and thought this would be a good place to start, and I could borrow it for free on my kindle. In all honesty I can't tell you if it can teach you anything. After about 10 pages I couldn't handle the glaring typos, grammar errors, pixelated photos that were useless, and pages that inexplicably ended and started again in the middle of another paragraph. Should have invested in a proofreader."
1,Basic Floral Design,The content of Basic Floral Design by Deborah Dolen provides a good basic overview of floral design. Most of the photos in Kindle version of the book are pixelated which is a disappointment for such a visually oriented topic and the reason for my poor review.
2,Long on intro but short on viewing!!,I clicked on Floral Design in Vases 101 to preview it but it only gives you 2 minutes of viewing before it goes off. Most of that 2 minutes is intro. The last 15 seconds is spent on the instructor telling us what kinds of arrangements will be viewing...that's it!!!How is anyone suppose to write a good review with such little viewing??? Please!
3,I hate to judge things so low but.....,I had a really hard time watching it. It seemed there was very little instruction and more watching her do it. I haven't even been able to finish it yet. :(
5,Floral Design in Vases 101,"I bought both videos she has Floral 101 and 102, which were very inspiring and taught me floral design in a very easy to understand way. I learn by seeing, but I found the matching Kindle book invaluable also. I refer to it a lot because it lays out all of the basics. To locate that book you have to select ""Kindle"" and then Deborah Dolen Floral [is how I get to it.] Why links are not all together seems to be an Amazon issue and it makes it hard to find her work.I am buying her gift basklet book and video next."
5,This can be simple,This is the best floral design book and videos I ever bought!!!! And I have bought plenty. Kuddos Mrs. Dolen
5,Best Floral Design Book EVER...with available extras!!!,"Ok, I bought the kindle book by Deborah Dolen Floral Design Basics and two videos (you have to go to Amazon tool bar and select TV and Movies for the download-able videos) and long story short they helped me greatly. I took a job as a floral designer and I did not know a thing about floral designing. But I did know I needed a job and I would do what it took to appear an expert on day one-which is next week. I have been buying every book on Floral Design and I was able to stop here.This author's work is comprehensive from start to finish. Any other book seemed to just focus on one area. None were enough to make me look educated over all. Deborah Dolen's series (with the two videos) was.THANK YOU! THANK YOUI THANK YOU!"
1,not for chewers,"i was always under the impression ""fat cat"" toys were supposed to be able to withstand some chewing. however, this did not last five minutes with my little jack russell and the stuffing was coming out!"
4,Fat Cat,"This is the 3rd one for my dog. She really likes this toy and likes to shake it around. The squeaker breaks after the first day, but the rest of the toy is pretty durable."
2,faulty spring,"this is a great invention. Unfortunately, the switch prefers to stay on. When I push off, it springs back on. I have to play with it to get it to stay off. Bummer"
5,My Daughter Loves it,"My 7 years old daughter loves this set. It has three tiaras for her to make using the supplies included in the pack. We took the set to a trip, and she worked on the three tiaras tirelessly without instruction. She made beautiful tiaras with three colors and wore one on different days. It is one of the best crafts we bought for her."
5,PERFECT FOR THE AIRPLANE,A pair of these books kept my daughters occupied during a 10 hour flight! Love these series. Check out the paper purses!
4,Everyone needs a tiara,"This book was a big success for my six- and eight-year-old granddaughters. Every day, a new tiara. How much better can it get?"
3,"Tony Bennett's ""If I Ruled The World"" is missing!","After i saw the movie, i needed to get the music, but as some of you guys noticed:the beautiful song when bruce and grace are in the restaurant is missing!i recognized the singer, it's the wonderful Tony Bennett..So i searched and found his song ""If I ruled the world"".Besides the missal of this song the score is very nice but short.And the mix of older, more classic songs and yonger, more contemporary songs, like from fatboy slim, make this soundtrack very vital.i'd give this soundtrack 6,5 points out of 10."
4,FYI...,"The song that plays when Jennifer Anistan is jogging is called ""God-Shaped Hole"" by Plumb. Hope it helps =)."
3,God Song,The song at the beginning of the credits is: Are You Ready for A Miracle sung by The World Harvest Choir from the album: The Sound Of Jubilee.
3,God songs,Great collection of God songs overall. Does anyone know the name of the gospel song right at the beginning of credits?
2,Don't waste your money....,"This soundtrack album exemplifies the problem of combining different musical genres on one album. Modern folk, hip-hop, instrumental melodies, it's all here. There is a huge difference between the types of songs on this album, and I cannot imagine that anyone will like it on the whole. Furthermore, most of these songs are available on the recording artists' own albums: If, for example, you like the music of Plumb or Fatboy Slim, you would be better off buying their own albums rather than paying for this album and getting just one of their songs. The only reason I can see for buying this particular album would be if you really like the movie's various instrumental melodies, or if your musical tastes are so eclectic that you really do appreciate both Vertical Horizon and Snap. For anyone else, this is a waste of money."
3,missing song,"i have seen Bruce almighty and listened to the soundtrack which is not bad.Some of the songs of the movie are not listed in the soundtrack and i refer to a very famous song, which is played when jim carrey runs with a cup of milk and pours it on a lot of children.I would like to know the title of this song which is found also in another movies. If someone has any information please respond immediately to the message.thankyou"
3,"Good soundtrack, bad movie","The soundtrack is fairly good, whereas the movie is far too mean, vulgar, and stupid to be funny."
4,Tony Bennett Song,Does anyone know the song Tony Bennett plays while Bruce is at the restaurante with Grace?
4,Barry White Song,"I thing the name of the Barry White song that Bruce puts on when he's ""seducing"" Jennifer Aniston is ""Never, Never Gonna Give You Up"" from ""The Ultimate Collection [Universal 2000]"""
1,Don't know much but I know I love you....,"The song is by Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt. It is on Aaron Neville's ""Ultimate Collection"" CD.....it's called ""Don't Know Much""."
3,Please Let Me Know!!!,"Well, I'm looking for the song in this movie which plays when Grace(bruce's girl friend) is angry with Bruce & she's in the Coffee shop buying a coffee..n she sees the signs reminding her of Bruce...the song which is playing in the background when she enters the coffee shop isn't listed in the soundtrack as ""I'm with you"" isn't either...will anybody let me know which song is it? Please!!! I'll really appreciate that! Thank You!"
2,"ANSWER to ""A music fan from germany""","the song is called ""IF I RULED THE WORLD"" is performed by ""TONY BENNETT"" written by ""CYRIL ORNADEL and LESLIE BRICUSSE""which is played when bruces girlfriend is expecting him to ask to marry her - I think it is an old movie song try your luck over the internet."
3,There's still one missing!!,"I watch the DVD of Bruce.There's a cute song during the DVD's ""menu section"".It's not in the movie but I love it very much.Anyone could help??"
2,Song Name Wanted,"When Bruce is about to become an anchor, he took his girlfriend to a restaurant. At there, there is a live band. Does anyone know who actually sing that song the guy was singing? what kind of music is that? Thanks for helping out!"
3,SONG TITLE???,What is the song called when bruce is walking outside and is upset that grace broke up with him???? please let me know!!!!!
3,"""if I ruled the world""","ok you guys ...you were right about that missing song...it was indeed Tony Bennett and the song IS called ""if I ruled the world""...the other guy who said it's not being called that way was wrong..maybe he got no results 'cos he missed a ""t"" trying to spell ""bennett"" as ""bennet"" and therefore his search produced limited or no results...anyhow..now that you know what song it is...try to look it up at kazaa or you get can buy one of the tony bennett's cds....good luck"
3,Missing Song,"Yea, ive been looking for that same song for so long...ANYONE...please if you can let it be known what the name of that ""cheesy Inspirational song"" is...i beg of u"
4,Suede Gloves,Exactly if not more than what we expected. Outstanding value. Confident it will pass the test of time.
2,A disappointment,"The disappointment is not in the quality of these DVDs--the disappointment is that the ""New Howdy Doody Show"" is not nearly as much fun as the old original program. The new show was stiff, over-rehearsed and mechanical. Check at your local Walmart in their display of ""dollar DVDs"" where you might find a DVD in just a sleeve for a buck that has 6 of the old original shows from the 1950's. For a dollar you will have a lot more fun watching Bob break up laughing, getting confused, and blowing his lines several times on camera. You'll love the cheap set (that looks like it came from the Salvation Army) and the noisy peanut gallery and the drawing of postcards from a plastic swimming pool for prizes of bicycles. It's the kind of silly fun that made the show a hit in the first place. The days of live and poorly rehearsed TV were just more fun--and still more fun to watch today."
5,A taste of heaven,"This is the most glorious choral music one could ever hope to hear, and the superb quality of the choir, orchestra and the recording itself makes this one of my very favorite CDs."
4,Nice Potty Seat,"My daughter took to this seat much better then the potty so I am thrilled about that. The only problem I have with this seat is that it doesn't fit perfectly onto my toilet so it moves occasionally which is a little annoying but I have never had to clean up any urine or anything else, everything goes right into the toilet, so that is a relief. I wish that you could just adjust the seat to fit better onto the toilet...If I could do that I would give this product five stars."
2,Okay - IF it fits your toilet seat,"I would rate this seat at 5 stars IF it would have fit all the seats in my house. Luckily, the most important seat we needed this for it fits perfectly. We have twin girls and needed two. Both are made the same, however out of three toilets we've put these on, only ONE works with this seat. :( The holes on the toilet seat are too small for the rim for the seat to sit on. Not sure why this seat isn't universal!"
1,YUUUUCK,"Even though others have said it, I have to chime in so no one else ends up buying this seat! I have a boy and the pee gets under the front AND back pieces that are attached to the bottom every single time. They can't be removed and the pee drips and even pours out of them when the seat is removed. I have to stand there for a long time trying to stick the edge of pieces of toilet paper under them to absorb the pee and while I'm doing the front piece, pee is pouring out from the back piece all over the hard-to-clean handles and the toilet. I just now threw it in the trash. My son is upset that I threw out his potty seat and I feel bad because I have been scolding him for not aiming well enough. Now that I have read the reviews from everyone else, I had to apologize to him and tell him that all the other boys have the same problem!"
1,Sharp seam on inner ring hurt son,"The seam on the inner ring is sharp and my son said it hurt when he touched it when he was going to the bathroom. We purchased this for my daughter about a year ago and it worked ok. Now that my son is ready to use it I am aware of the problem. My husband examined the seat and said we need to stop using it, they are just asking for a serious accident to happen. I contacted Munchkin today and there response is since I don't have an exact day of purchase and they can't take it back for sanitary reasons I am out of luck. You should have heard the person I spoke to I have never spoken to such a rude person. My review is don't purchase if you have a boy or ever expect to have a boy visit."
1,Beware,"Beware of this seat. As funny as this might sound at first, it was pretty scary. My son put this over his head and around his neck. It was very scary because it was difficult to remove, not to mention painful. My mother was letting him play with it and that is what happened. This seat should be designed with a split somewhere so that this doesn't happen. I've told my son that it wasn't a hat, but I'm still afraid of having it around. Hopefully he isn't too traumatized by this and will potty train soon."
5,Great!!,"I feel so bad that this seat has such a low ranking. It is perfect for my girl. I do understand why people with boys may have issues, but if you have a girl it is just wonderful. I have a very cheap one that is designed similarly but this one is so much better. It has a great weight to it so it's not flimsy, and it fits my girls bum so nicely, and the cushion is very firm yet soft. The handles make is so easy for her to just climb up on the stool, sit and pull herself back.My friend has the pricey Bjorn and while that is nice, I saved $15 on something that works just as well."
2,Maybe okay for a girl...but not a boy!,"Seems like a good idea for a seat. I liked the handles for them to hold on to (more sanitary) and it sits okay on a big adult seat. But the opening is just too small. It is not the lack of a deflector. I have another brand with a bigger opening for our other bathroom and my son does fine on that one. This one the pee gets all over his legs, the seat, the stool and the floor each and every time. This is a big hassle, unsanitary and a pain to clean up each time he tries to go potty. Maybe it would be okay for a petite girl but not for a boy. We are shopping for a replacement now. I don't want a deflector type because the doctors warn that they can scrape a little boys private area and cause them to not want to sit on the potty because it might hurt. We just teach him to point ""it"" down and on a potty with a bigger opening that works just fine."
1,no splash guard,"my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now."
1,Unsanitary!,"This seat is awful for boys! The splashguard works okay for my son, but if pee runs under the seat it gets trapped in the rim. The rim parts don't come off and you can try to rinse under them, but they don't drain. It's disgusting!"
5,"Please, Release it !!!","We want this CD now.It Should be a live cd, hopefully recorded before 1976.Should be released Nov 2005, then Dec 2005, then postponed to january 6 2006.WHERE IS THE CD?????Norway wants it now:-("
2,Very Fake!,I was disappointed in this item. Nothing about it looks real. Many silk flowers I have purchased were more authentic looking.
4,Thought it was nice.,"I really like this CD. I bought it in a store and paid much more for it. I'm sorry I didn't come here sooner, could have saved a few bucks. I like the coconut song the best."
3,Eclectic mix of romantic tunes,"Definitely a diverse collection of sentimental songs--the kind of CD you play when trying to set a romantic mood. Also works well as a ""wind-down, I think I'll sit down and have a cup of herbal tea"" soundtrack. More mellow than I had hoped, but entertaining none the less."
2,Slick soundtrack fares better than forgettable flick.,"But just barely. I don't know whether to cry or cheer about the inclusion of ""Black Eyed Dog"" by Nick Drake on this soundtrack. In one sense I feel some regret that his name and memory should be sullied by association with this film, er, Hollywood movie. On the other hand , the soundtrack producer should at least be commended for knowing of this talented artist. Not enough people do, or did. Hopefully for some mature and curious music lovers his song rose above some of the dross such that they will seek out his anthology and enjoy it long after they have forgotten the title of this movie (and Stevie Nicks). His is music that makes you think and feel! Unlike most of the star tracks which can't elicit any real feeling unless you count irritation as an emotion."
2,disappointing,"There's a terrible trend in movies today, which is to patch in music that can be sold as a single, and ignore the original composition. Those wanting more of the original soaring score don't get it here - they just get the jukebox stuff.This has meant that the music for movies isn't as good as it could be, which means the movies aren't. And a lot of good composers are going hungry. I hope the congomerates are happy. Bah!"
2,generally ok,"i wish the songs Black Magic woman and B---- by Meredith Brooks were included on here. It was a big disappointment to me that they weren't,after all they were included on the pay per view blurbs."
4,A Magickal Soundtrack!,"The CD was really very nice, although alot of the songs were old and corny, there's a few good ones on there, like Faith Hill's 'Perpetual Bliss', and LisaHall's...magickal...sensual..and sultry song, 'Is This Real'. If you don't mind a few oldies but cornies, grab this Cd."
4,i've got both now,"finally!!!...i've always wanted the music to the movie. now that i'd recently purchased the movie, i wanted the music even more. i saw this movie when i was a little girl, and it just, made me feel happy. this album is worth buying, they both are *movie and album*."
5,Practical Magic sountrack-- GREAT!,"If you loved the movie, you will love the soundtrack! I was not dissapointed at all. Since it was a older movie it has been hard to track down. It was worth all the effort!!"
5,This is a MUST HAVE CD!,"As soon as I saw the movie I knew I had to have the soundtrack. At first I bought it for that on 'totally awesome song ""thiss Kiss"" it is SUCH a good song! But then I listened to the rest of the songs and they're all great! Joni Mitchell, Elvis Presley, Faith Hill! Its awesome! You have to buy it!"
3,alan silvestri,"granted,this is a good album of songs from a good film. but, i would love to see the completed score that alan silvestri did released. okay,so these great songs are in the film. some of us out here love just the music. silvestri did a marvelous job in creating an atmosphere in ever scene. listen to the music where one of the daughters holds a bowl of flower petals and wishes they find a future love. now that is one beautiful piece! how about that great music when the neighborhood women form the circle around kidman, to rid her of the demon. i get chills every time i hear it! micheal nyman is a great composer,but i really was hoping for silvestri's. does anyone feel the way i do??"
4,Stevie Nicks and a movie about witches. What a concept!,"Stevie Nicks has always been a self-described Welsh Witch, so this soundtrack has to have, not one, but two songs from the mystical chanteuse. Crystal--her Fleetwood Mac tune, done in a newer style by Stevie for the album and the first track. Both tunes are produced by Sheryl Crow. ""This Kiss"" is a great tune by Faith Hill and some thumpin' mood music from lisahall, et al. I have enjoyed this soundtrack numerous times since I purchased it last week. Pretty good movie, too."
5,Practical Magic is Great!,This cd is great and exactly what I expected. Great for popping in the car player and listening going down the road! Great artists and songs!
5,practical magic soundtrack,"love this cd, there are two songs from Stevie Nicks and one with Cheryl Crow. Love it!!"
1,Not happy,"Item that is pictured isn't the item that was spent. When I called, I kept getting put thru to voice mails. When I finally got in touch, they promised full refund and then didn't give me all the money back. Actually overcharged me for the shipping as well. Not happy at all. Will never buy from again."
5,right case for the job.,I got this for a very reasonable price. It is a kit in OEM box. The case is real leather and tag w/ OEM name. Neck strap is extremely heavy duty. Battery is OEM. Surprised with quality and the price.
1,ripp offf,i brought this action figure for my goddaughter she loves catwoman . when i looked at her she looked like she was a nice size but three to four buisness days later i got a 2inch ripp off i wouldent even spend 5 dollars on yet alone 15!
3,Meh,Not as great compared to their other videos. Some good parts but thought it would be more than it was.
5,A masterpiece of progressive rock,"This is an astounding album, filled with awesome musicianship and musical ideas that go way beyond the norm. Although one can hear very strong King Crimson and Gentle Giant influences, Thinking Plague create a sound all their own. This is the best prog-rock album I've heard in years."
3,Thought wrought,"Never a band to theorize lightly, TP can sometimes loose out emotional involvement in slavish service to syncopated signatures."
3,"Easier than""In this life"",similar to G.G's ""Power&the glory""","Well this album is quite in the vein of Gentle Giant's ""The power and the glory"", in an acid and harsh version(such roughness is more evident than into ""In this life"")... nevertheless it's easier and accessible than ""In this life"", event though is much resembling some RIO style, as they finally concentrate themselves on the melodic aspects of music and the ouput is perhaps ""less forced""! You don't care about the sloppy rhythms and some simple guitar structures too, whenever They succeed in creating something fresh and original; but once again you can like or hate them, and for this reason I can not give my definitive ""sentence"" about them ..."
4,Super Reader,"Doc Savage is back in Chile, for the dedication of a hospital built with his charity donation/fee earned in the last book.A young woman, Rae Stanley, is desperately seeking his help to find her missing father, a professor.A group of Tibetans is also around, and a mysterious blue meteor is seen in the air, and it has a debilitating and disabling effect on all who hear it.Doc and the crew must try and track down and stop Mog-Wei, the meteor master, and others that want the secret of the blue meteor.Races along this one, with a tragic type of ending you can spot pretty early."
1,"Disappointing! Not at all Wavelets made ""easy"".","This book was quite a disappointment. It was not, as titled, Wavelets Made Easy. Despite the author's claims to the contrary, the book was not easy to read, largely due to the strongly professional mathematician's approach with unnecessarily obscure and involved notation. Later in the book the author adopted the mathematical formalism of proposition, proof, and lemma which is out of place in an introductory text aimed at non-mathematicians. Though the book treats a variety of applications of wavelets, little attention is paid to the background for these applications. Again, mathematical formalism takes precedence. Not recommended except perhaps for mathematicians, and for these, better texts are available."
1,You need a graduate degree in Mathmatics to read this,"Wavelets made easy, the title is sarcastic. It only uses high school algebra or basic trig functions? WRONG! It starts out as advanced text to 2nd year grad students or those working on a PhD, almost every page has unproven formulae, its up to YOU and your team of 10 or so grad students and billions of dollars in lab tools and resources to double check the work they provide.Professors of Math or those with 20 years of wavelet research may be able to mull thru the book in a few months perhaps. The style of writing is typical of authors who dont want to explain the concept but only pretend to appear smarter than they really are."
3,Similiar to the early UFC events.,Only thing different is that it is in a boxing ring instead of the octagon. This tape a tai boxing and early Pete Williams the man who knock out Mark Coleman at an UFC. The Joe Charles vs. Pete Williams bout is very good.
5,Clean nails!,I really like the white pencils as I had not been able to find the Revlon ones that I had purchased in the past...so it delighted me to be able to order them and get them quickly and are what I was looking for....Nice bag they came in too!
3,Nail Whitening Pencil,"The pencil worked very well for whitening the tips of your natural nails. It doesn't last through very many hand washings, but gives a nice look to the nails. Easy to apply once a day."
1,Not Worth the Price,"I ordered this item based on a recommendation I read in a magazine. What a disappointment! It doesn't do a very good job of whitening, it doesn't last, and it's way too expensive."
1,Poor Publishing Quality,"This book was purchased as a textbook for class. Although I can't comment on the text content at this time, the print quality for the price is unacceptable. I do not expect the binding to hold up for the term let alone for long term reference in the teaching profession. The paper quality is so poor that you can read the print through the back side of the page. Black and white photos are blurry. It appeared to be produced by someone with a cheap laser printer. I'm truly disappointed that Prentice Hall would let this pass their quality control."
3,Not the greatest,Not exactly the greatest book I've ever owned...the computer background information is woeful (I found 3 glaring mistakes in 70 pages of material by just skimming). The book has generally good information on the software it covers and a pretty good intro to MIDI.
5,Very informative for beginners in the Music Technology field,My Music Technology class used this for last semester. It has a broad overview of the technology of Music Engineering ranging from MIDI to running the Macintosh OS. One of the best things about it is the fact that it uses mostly simple language to explain the topics it covers. Any Music Tech. student would be advised to purchase this book. Many Music Ed. majors I know also use this book. It covers how to utilize computer software in Music Theory classes and composing classes.
3,BOOK REVIEW,"HAVEN'T READ IT YET, DR SMULLYAN TAUGHT A CLASS I TOOK AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY WHEN I WAS AJUNIOR PHILOSOPHY UNDERGRAD MAJOR."
1,Don't buy,This is why you don't buy some things over the internet. Phone tree to nowhere and they sent me the wrong part (driver side instead of passenger side). Then I get a phone call promising to fix the problem if I removed my review. They never fixed the issue. Don't do business with this shady outfit.
1,Worse seller ever,They sent wrong itemThen i call them and they promise to send the right item also saidThat will make a refund and still nothing happenI'm very Mad
4,Nice idea... reusable zip ties!,I gave these a try and they are pretty good. They are wider than the normal zip ties which can be tricky in tight spots but they seemed to work well where they would fit. I wish they sold packets of various lengths.
5,a song for my daughter,I had a lot of trouble finging a song that could come close to how I feel. When I heard this song I was amazed it said everything that I wanted to say. I highly recommend this song.
5,Beautiful Mother to Daughter song for a wedding,Fantastic song for a Mother to play for her Daughter on her wedding day....I love the singers voice and music is very appropriate.
5,Beautiful orchestration,"I love this CD. In addition to the beatiful lyrics and vocals by Ray Allaire, the orchestration is great too. Strings, flutes, oboe, harp, grand piano, etc. Many songs today are too techno, but this has a beautiful classic touch, the kind that never goes out of style. Well done!"
2,Let Down Bride,I bought this thinking I could dance with my father to it. It is not a dancing song. I was very disappointed in this CD.
1,generic lounge singer taps into wedding sentiment,"Forgetting the sentiment, this and every other Mikki Verrick recording sounds as if she did it on a 2 track analog machine in her basement. The sound quality and recording are just horrid. And there is no orchestration or richness to it. It's a mediocre lounge singer with an electronic keyboard."
1,Brought us closer!!!,"This is probably the worst song ever written, but my daughter and I had a great time making fun of it and rolling around on the floor laughing! We decided that we're gonna hire a live band and dance our butts off... look out! No need for a sappy father/daughter dance... we can't wait!"
1,Very Disappointing,"The arrangement was crushed and some of the grapes were rolling around in the box when I took it out. Very drab and cheap looking. All in all, very disappointed and I returned it to Amazon b/c it was damaged. I will not order silk arrangements via the mail again."
5,Great Book!,"This book was a quick read, just a couple of nights. I could not put it down. I live near where the author grew up, and the story is based, and pass by Walton Lake almost daily. I am looking forward to future books. Well written, and makes you feel as if you are there, very descriptive, but easy to follow. I am going to pass it on to family and friends, I am sure they will enjoy it as much as I have!"
3,Racist and Elitist Reviewers,"So Far, I've only read numerous racist and elitist reviews. I am not going to comment on Cornel Wests' CD, but instead on the sheer studpidity and vindictiveness of the small-minded people who took the time to be so negative. I'm surprised that such trivial and mean-spirited comments are even posted considering they say nothing that sincerely reviews the CD, but instead focus on how disagreeable they find the scholar and his academic discipline. For shame on them for taking up the time of those of us who want to read an objective and valid critique of the CD."
1,"Shoemaker, stick to your last.","Lord but this is an embarrassing production. Leonard Nimoy albums manifest more soul than this excruciating vanity project. At its best, the ""music"" here soars to the level of an uplifting jingle in a pharmaceutical ad. The spoken word content consists of a steady drone of Cornel's nebulous after-school-special pieties, leavened with the odd statistic. I'm giving copies away as stocking stuffers this Christmas to my academic friends."
2,Gomer Pyle's greatest hits (I know some of you can remember),"I've been to a few of his lectures, and I truly cannot dismiss the fact that Cornell is one of the most dynamic speakers I've ever seen, and met in my lifetime. Out of the great respect that I have for the man; I wish this CD would just go away! It's like your drunk uncle showing up to your high school party and embarrassing you by showing your friends some of the ""moves"" they used to do back in the day."
1,Corny West Flunks..,"The prof has listened to Sly & the Family Stone and Prince, but he can't sing and he can't rap either.If you're into political raps, go for Gil Scott Heron."
1,Puff Corny versus George Clinton?,"Parliament and Public Enemy need not fear being overshadowed by Professor Booty. This CD IS hilarious, it's so ridiculously pathetic that it's worth a listen just to experience that awful grimace brought on by truly bad atistic expression. The only thing I can compare it to is watching Al Gore dancing to Fleetwood Mac back at the Dem's election night party back in 1992. ... Believe me, a rap rendition of critical race theory is about the least entertaining and least edifying thing imaginable in the entire wide universe. (On the other hand, it's no worse or cliche ridden than any of the good profesor's published writings.)"
4,meaningful,"I think this is an important collection of music and spoken word. Dr. West has a voice, and something to say. Anyone who speaks for the oppressed leaves himself open to irrational criticism from people who allign themselves with the oppressors, and we are certainly seeing the evidence of that here and in many of the reviews posted about his books on this site and others. The voice of the oppressor is usually louder than the voice of the oppressed, so I think it is important for Dr. West and others like him to speak out and be willing to do whatever it takes to have their voices heard.The cd is good-maybe not great in a musical or lyrical sense, but it's message is clear and well articulated. I recommend it to anyone who has a desire to learn more about the African American experience."
5,"Finally, Music with a message that needs to be heard!","How much can you listen to lyrics about money and honies andblunts and gats without it all starting to sound the same?Dr. West speaks of things that need to be heard by all generations, all cultures. There is no better way for a message to get through than when it is accompanied by music, and ""Sketches"" speaks volumes. Not your ""Average"" rap or hip hop CD, but music with meaning. Outstanding!"
2,A Temper Tantrum Awkwardly Scored,"Fancy words, but mostly cries of an emotionally disabled man. Would be nice if Dr. West grew."
5,all of rory blocks are five star.,"True mississippi delta blues,no doubt about it.I got to see rory in sarasota florida,I am sorry to say that I had not heard of her before than.What a awakening did I have,I could not believe how strong and true to missippi delta blues she is.Talk about raw blues,you have got to 'LOVE Rory Block.Thanks for all the true missippi delta blues,Ronne Drummond."
3,Good for home use but not for a small business connection,"Not a bad router but make sure you get patched from the vendors website beware though, when it drops dsl connections it needs to power cycled to get the connection going again."
1,Worthless,"Went to replace my factory unit for a decent 200W JVC headunit and wanted some new speakers to go with. I didn't expected much of these, since the price is so low. But even so, it failed completly. The first blew out after 5 days of normal use, and the other sounds terrible with tremendous amount of distortion. Highs are too loud no matter how you tuned it, bass gets grumpy at medium volume. Doesn't even worth to try it, its a waste of money & time."
5,Ringo is absolutely worth the investment,"Shosai Strip is an incredible album. Of course, so are Ringo's other singles and albums, some of which are available here on Amazon. ...She also released her third DVD of video clips... if you can view Japanese DVDs you must check it out. Her concert and recent releases have caused many more people to catch ""Ringo-byou"" (Ringo-fever) here in Tokyo, so if you are sophiticated enough to have found this link on Amazon US, I would definitely recommend you pick up Ringo's latest releases from Japan and enjoy her talent and creativity yourself. Note that her singles (Honno, Mayonaka wa Junketsu, etc.) have excellent ""B-sides"", i.e., additional tracks not available on the albums. That and the CD cover art make them absolutely worth the purchase price. I could go on, but I will stop here :-)"
1,Not worth It,"Okay, I normally don't believe in giving bad feedback on an item, but this is one that just isn't worth it. Unless you live in a dance studio, there's no way you can learn this. Also, this is nothing like the dances done at the country clubs."
1,Terrible for New Dancers!,"I thought this video was awful. The instruction begins with no introduction, then quickly gives you the first steps. There are no repeat instructions. You have to be able to go from the first time you are ""quickly"" shown to the next step. There is no initial ""slow down"" of the steps. They are done quickly, and you are expected to remember them in the 2-3 seconds that you learn the next step with no real instruction. You could learn as much watching someone actually dance, and probably more. My husband and I were looking forward to this video, and it was a really big disappointment. DEFINATELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS, AS THE TITLE SUGGEST!!"
2,Not for beginners.,"This video is not for beginners. I am an experienced dancer. I picked a copy of this DVD up at the library hoping to be able to teach my boyfriend how to dance country and western dance. I know that this really wont help him.It will only give me a quick refresher so that I can teach him. It's great for a refresher for someone who already has a good idea of how to do the dance and teach to someone else, but otherwise, do not get this if you are a beginner yourself. Spend some money and get a teacher (about the same cost of a regular dance DVD, but better instruction - one on one attention to detail), or surely there are better videos out there."
1,waste of time,This is NOT for beginners. The narrator in the video does not break down the steps or explain the theory of things. It's hard to follow and really understand what's happening. You cannot learn from this video. It's even frustrating to watch because it is so fast paced. It's useless as a training video.
2,takes a few listens to get used to..,"at first i was disappointed, but the more chances i gave the cd's the more i grew into them. 2nd disk has some good tracks and finishes well but the wait is too long and the good tracks that make up the closing are too few. im a huge fan of ferry's, not his best, but worth a listen."
5,Simply beautiful...,"This is the only bass album that one can listen repeatedly, because the melodies are beautiful and unique and one does not get quickly saturated with slap-heavy or overwhelming or overplayed pieces. I played this CD several times as background music for dinner parties and every single time there was someone who wanted to borrow it. It is a collection of relaxing, rich melodies, somehow transcending the bass guitar inherent rhytmic gene and low range. This is the best bass album I ever bought (and I listened to a lot of them)."
1,So far 2 haven't worked the way it should,"I have a first generation sylvania dvd recorder that can record up to 8x, and yet these discs (for which I had high hopes for since I had bought the older memorex 4x dvd-rs way back when that came with a regular sized dvd case did work flawlessly) these discs, just didn't work. They look nice and everything coming with the newer slimline dvd cases, but yeah they didn't seem to work with my player. Maybe because its older, who knows. I caution you on buying this , or maybe it will work better with newer recorders. But these were supposed to work I mean it says 4x on it.I have 8 left , I'm not gonna use these right now. I'll buy a newer recorder and see if it does the same thing."
1,"NOT as advertised, and poor quality","The product page suggests that this is a Verbatim name brand toner cartridge, but what I received was a generic refurbished cartridge, as stated by the other reviewer. This would fine except that it also caused my printer to print large unsightly streaks on all of my printouts -- not exactly helpful for printing resumes, wedding invitations labels, etc. I guess I'll have to buy that $80 official Samsung toner now."
5,Good seller.,"I am satisfied with this seller. Good service, quick delivery. Will buy from them if I have another chance. The compatible ink toner of Verbatim can only be used in printing text, not image: it produces horizontal lines on solid color areas. But it's Verbatim's fault, not this seller."
1,fool me once,"I did not receive a verbatim cartridge but a cheap imitation, too much trouble to exchange. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... well you know the rest. Let's just say I won't be making future purchases from Toner Pal :("
3,Item not as depicted,"The picture indicates that this was supposed to be a Verbatim brand cartridge. It was some unknown knock off brand instead.On the good side, it's working so far."
5,"wonderful interpretation, perfect sound","I love this music from the first moment i heard them and this is the interpretation i love for many years. (First as a Vox-Box, then on Reference Recordings)Skrowaczewski gives a wonderful fine, sensitive interpretation.The sound is absolutely first class with my Pioneer DVD-Player. Bernie Grundman`s mastering is phantastic.Very dynamic, very fine, the brass and the drums have great impact and the sound of the strings is very different and fine. Fine separation of the instruments.I would like to hear this on and on."
3,"Nice, but not multichannel","This disk appears to be a DVD (not DVD-A) using the 24 bit, 96 kHz stereo (only) capability of any DVD player, which is disappointing given that these recordings were made in 4-channel and are represented as such in the Original Master Recording of the same material. My recommendation is to pay a little more and get the multichannel Original Master Recording version on SACD."
3,fine,"the product is good, but the delivery is kind of inconvenient because they can't read my address."
3,Three for a Beginner,"I'm usually very skeptical of teen singing sensations. I never signed on the Joss Stone band wagon. However, giving Sonya Kitchells' new cd an objective listen she shows remarkable promise as a singer songwriter.....just needs some more life experience. No doubt Ktchell will be bombarded with Norah Jones comparisions and that is not such a bad thing -- all the edges here are polished smooth as silk. Her vocal arrangements are casual and relaxed and like Jones her songs and their production are perfectly matched to her vocal ability. Great melody throughout the disc. This is a good cd and an artist to watch."
5,Wassenaar Review,"Sonya Kitchell played at the North Sea Jazz Fetival this summer(2007). She was absolutely phenomenal, and so was her band. They played so tighly together and clearly enjoyed themselves. Her pianist is a genius too. There hung an atmosphere of sensitivity and collaboration. She has a unique style with a warm intonation and a voice with suspense. Yes, suspense! She sometimes speaks as if reading a poem in rhythm,to flow the next second into singing. One could hear a pin drop at the North Sea Jazz Festival! Keep Going Sonya!"
3,Give her a few more years and she could be fantastic,"Singing and writing soul and jazz-influenced pop is not an easy thing to do. The tendency is to be very derivative of older musicians; it can take years to craft your own unique style. So it goes here. On some songs you can hear Aretha. On others you can hear Billie Holiday or Anita Baker or Nina Simone. And sometimes you can hear something original, a new voice that if it develops further will turn into something special.Sonya Kitchell has a wonderful instrument in her voice. She attacks her lyrics, and while her singing style isn't fully formed yet, she's well on her way to becoming a top-notch vocalist. Her song lyrics are what you might expect from a mature teenager. This album isn't great; but she's so young that she has plenty of time to develop as an artist. Unlike Joss Stone, Ms. Kitchell is no manufactured pretty face. She's a real musician. Her future could be very, very bright."
3,Needs Songwriting,"I think that Ms. Kitchell will be singing songs for a very long time. My complaint centers around the songwriting ... it needs some help. I love her voice, but the songs are mundane. Perhaps it is because she is so young. Still, the CD is worth a listen as there are a few songs that break out of the mundane. I don't know why someone in the music industry has not suggested some help from a songwriter. Keep singing, Sonya!"
1,Simply AWFUL!,"I love using artichoke hearts in dishes. These were awful!! The texture was gritty, tough, quite simply awful. I gave the cans away to friends, all of which said they were nasty. Do not waste you time nor your money."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I normally do not go out of my way to rate a product, but felt I was doing a huge disservice to others by not doing so in this case. Product was a huge disappointment. Each & every can was unusable. At first I thought the product was raw & needed to be cooked, but that was not the case. Hearts are rock hard...even steaming for 30 minutes did not soften. Unfortunately, the only place I found useful was in the trash! Save your money!!!"
3,very disappointed !,"I'm a senior citizen & have enjoyed artichokes all my life. That said, I was purchasing mine at the local grocery & they were always good. When I found them on Amazon, decided to purchase a pack of 12 of both the bottoms and hearts..I was planning on using them for the holidays. So far, I've opened 2 cans of bottoms and both were not usable...one bottom looked rusty and the others were so tough, I couldn't serve them..couldn't even cut them with a sharp knife ! Opened 2 cans of the hearts...one was ok and passable but the other wasn't..now I have 10 cans of each and I wonder if any of them are going to be edible..know I can't return them but this is a real inconvenience...they were purchased to be holiday treats and now I'm thinking I'm out the money paid for them and probably will be lucky if at least one or two cans are usable. I've purchased many items from Amazon & have always been satisfied until now. ..my eperience with these was very upsetting !"
1,Poor quality product,"These artichoke bottoms are HUGE and TOUGH! I'm wondering if they're even real, because they don't taste real! I ordered a whole case of 12 and I wish I could return them, but I've already opened 2 of the cans. I would not recommend them to anyone who loves artichokes!"
3,Bottoms up,"We like any kind of artichoke in my family, but the bottoms are so easy to include in anything. Salad, Spaghetti Sauce, roasted veg, etc. I use them as a bulking agent with class."
4,Great savings!,"I picked up 2 cases of Reese Artichokes on a Friday Sale. These andReese Artichoke Hearts, Extra Small Size, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12). Both were well worth what I paid at an average of $.99 a can, compared to $3+ in my local grocery store.These are great chopped up and added to salads, but my favorite way to eat them is to top them with a stuffing and bake. This is an easy one:3 Slices French bread cubed2 Artichoke bottoms chopped1 clove garlic minced1/8 cup fresh parsley chopped1/4 cup Romano cheese grated1/2 tsp dried Italian Seasoning5 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil1/2 cup chicken brothsalt and pepper to tasteCombine everything except 3 tablespoons of oil, top each Artichoke Bottom with a couple spoonfuls of mixture. Then drizzle remaining oil over them. I also sprinkle on a little extra cheese. Bake for 15 minutes at 425*F."
1,old woody bottoms,"I was injured early this summer so I've had to turn to the internet and the mail to get the vegetables I used to be able to buy fresh. I was amazed to find these at such a great price, but I should have remembered, that you get what you pay for.I've used two of the cans of the 12 I bought and both cans had the same problea. The bottoms are from old, woody artichokes and are very poorly cleaned. Once you scrape off all the inedible woody tissue, you only have about 40% usable artichoke meat. I won't be purchasing these again."
2,Disappointed,"The product did arrive very quickly. However, the artichokes seemed hard and looked very old. They had a rust color on the product itself. Would not order again."
1,Bad food/good frisbee!,"I bought a case of these for a very small amount of money $12.64 but it was still to much. I opened one can and frankly these are really funky, but they might make a good mini-frisbee! If you do not want flavor, you have found your dream food."
4,Very Strong First Person Accounts,"This is a very good set of first person accounts of this disease. it is getting harder and harder for young people to find account from those who survived or were directly affected by this terrible disease. This book does a good job of illuminating that era for the young reader. The other place a reader can get a strong sense of this era and its aftermath is at the History of Vaccines site, developed by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. ( [...] ) The two resources worked well together for me."
3,its no mystery for me,"This Dana Girls Mystery, The Mysterious Fireplace is an excellent book. It is full of suspense and keeps the reader wanting to read on and on. The book starts out with a precious family heirloom gone missing, the Dana girls get right on the case. They easily solve it and return the precious heirloom. Next, for the holidays, the girls travel to Indian Mountain with their uncle and family friends. The girls think this will be a relaxing way to celebrate Christmas, but they are wrong. Things start happening that are unexplainable and clues start appearing. All these problems lead to a mystery that needs to be solved. This book is a wonderful thriller than any reader will enjoy."
2,DVD Falsely Synchronized,"You probably can't get a more perfect version of this requiem, but unfortunately the sound is about 2 seconds ahead of the vision, so the whole DVD is out of sync, which is most annoying when viewing it. I got a headache as a result. Best just to turn off the picture and just listen to it. But the makers of the DVD should have realized this before releasing it!"
3,Very sobby.,"I purchased this CD because my MIL insisted on having a song for the father of the groom (to his son). She said it brought tears to her eyes and the father would DEFINITELY appreciate something like this. I played it for my then fiance before the wedding and he said You are NOT playing this at our wedding! My father in law heard this after the wedding and said Thank God you didn't play this, how awkward! So, there you have it. Apparently it's a huge hit with the older women and guys find it awkward and uncomfortable to listen to. Make sure you have a GUY who knows the family well listen to this and consider what he says before you play this at a wedding."
4,I had seen this previously and liked it,This movie had been seen by me before and I liked it. That is why I bought it. I liked it.
5,An amazing emotional performance,"After watching this DVD,you will realize that Sinead O'connor is a real human being and not just a controversial rebel who ripped up the Pope's picture and sports a shaved head,but also a loving mother and singer.Sinead's live verision of ""Molly Malone"" is amazing,every time I watch her perform this song my father and I break down to tears it's so emotional.Sinead nearly cries at the end of most of her songs and the audio on this DVD is just like being there(take my advice,I've seen her live)or listening to the CD,only much more powerful.I strongly recommend all serious Sinead O'connor fans to purchase this moving DVD!!!!"
5,Excellent DVD,Sinead is in rare form in this concert and she plays great Irish classics. Pitch and note perfect. Nothing wasted on this dvd.
2,sound and video not in sync,"the material is good, but the sound and the video is so out of synch at times, it is painful to watch.Too bad because the show and the extras are good."
5,a must have!!,Sinead is Brilliant. Treat yourself to someone who actually sings what she believes in. A perfect DVD
2,Not as good an author as Tom Connery,"This was my first book by David Donachie. I have been looking for a new book by Tom Connery (David Donachie pseudo) & tried this book hoping He would be able to write naval fiction as enjoyable as his ""Markham of the Royal Marines"" series. Though the writing is a little easier to read than say Patrick O'Brian, David doesn't seem to have a grasp of naval style or knowledge to pull this off. He should stick to subjects He has proven He knows about."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap",Don't waste your money. A lot of people think that a video would be easier to understand how their software works rather than reading the manuals or related books. Don't believe it. These videos (like other Digital Music Doctor videos) are a waste of money. Read the manuals. Checkout the DVDs that come with the program. Buy the books for more information than what's available in the manual. Poke around in the program (you aren't going to hurt it!). But DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on these DVDs lacking in real world information about your software. You will be disappointed at the loss of $40.
4,Not bad at all,"There are so many ""how to"" tutorials for Pro Tools out there.The strength of this particular set is the very deliberate pace of each tutorial. They take the time on simple tracks to walk through exactly what combination of keystrokes are achieving the edits. In very clear language, without a lot of ""industry speak"", they not only explain the process, but the reasoning musically BEHIND the process.For those of you perhaps mixing or editing your first dozen projects or so, this is good, basic, clearly presented material.There is no substitute for experience -- but when confronted with hundreds of new options and feeling a little overwhelmed, or just trying to move to the next level of understanding or speed in your musical process. . . this is a good start."
3,Good book.,"This is a good overview of Christian doctrinal development. But if theology is what you look for, purchase Berkhof's larger systematic theology instead. If you want something much more up to date-(from the same tradition) get R.L Reymond's recent systematic theology."
1,inaccurate,"while this book may seem excellent from the point of view of the beginner, it is subtly riddled with the personal bias of the author, sometimes subjective, sometimes plain incorrect.Newcomers to philosophy should steer clear of this book, and look for a proper, objective analysis"
4,Karminsky Experience Inc. - The Power Of Suggestion,"ESL is rightly known for its outstanding downtempo output, and THE POWER OF SUGGESTION, a collection of singles put out by the mysterious Karminsky Experience Inc., is no different. ""Departure"" is a beautifully mellow piece with plenty of spunk and verve, possibly the best track on the album. ""Assignment Istanbul"" is all spy-movie moodiness, while ""The Power of Suggestion"" is a hypnotic seductress. ""A Little Happening"" is a short foray into a beat jazz cafe, while ""The Wayward Camel"" is an outstanding Arabic/electronic fusion. Some of the tracks are a bit lackluster, but it's not a major detraction from the album as a whole, especially when you have pumping tracks like ""The Hip Sheik."" Even the slower tracks like ""Behind the Bamboo Curtain"" have something to recommend them. My suggestion: definitely give this album a try."
4,"An interesting ""chillout"" band","This album is something new, original about experimental music field. The tones are rhythmic and relaxed at the same time, giving to all the tracks a ""movie soundtrack"" feeling. Suggested to everyone is in searching of something new, something original.Carlo"
5,Quite possibly Darkest Hour's finest,"This, Darkest Hour's first release is a surprisingly super good listen, with all of Darkest Hour's finest qualities, speed, amazing solos, mellow acoustic moments, and great vocals. There is a little bit more breakdowns on this CD then Darkest Hour has on any of their others, and they fit really well into these songs. What amazes me most is how young Darkest Hour was when they made this and how good it is. I'd say that this and Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation are tied for Darkest Hour's best."
3,greek myth beautifully illustrated,"Because of the visual beauty of this series I was expecting a higher quality of illustrations. The story is well told of the boy who is given an impossible challenge like Hercules and the 12 tasks, overcomes because of some help by various magical people, and of course wins the princess. However the illustrations though well done lack life: they look like copies of old prints without the infusion of an original personal touch. The font used for the story would be better if it was sharp and clear thus easier to read. Still it is well told and could be used in a classroom to tell the ancient Greek story successfully."
5,IMMENSLEY ENTERTAINING,"*Wacky* alternative to the old school history books.Great music, Wonderful singing/acting.Very witty and clever dialogue/libretto.You can see the staging as you listen.Again, only word to describe this is WACKY.Recorded in 1970 with a cast of relative unknowns and beautifully remastered to the highest of Opera Rara's standards.They are all outstanding as well as The Orchestra and conducting from, a young up and comer, at the time, Alun Francis.I think some producers are missing the boat here.This would make a great Opera production as well as a Tony winning Broadway play..Immensely entertaining.Highly recommended.."
2,"Good vocals, but even in 1967 this stuff sounded dated,.","When I was about 14 (1972 or so), my mom bought me a copy of their ""Psycle"" LP that I'm sure she found in a cutout bin, to prove that she was in touch with the young, hip sounds the kids were listening to. She meant well, but despite the groovy cover, they were still a doo-wop group from New Jersey. This is the album that had ""I Got Rhythm"", as well as covers of ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and ""My Mammy"". Covering Al Jolson was not hip. They were produced by the Tokens and sound pretty much like them. Nice voices, but the music hasn't aged all that well, IMHO. I'm not familiar with the first album, except for the big hit ""See You in September"", but I'm sure that it's similar. A pleasant enough artifact from the days of Top 40 AM radio, but that's about it."
1,Compilations are pointless in the CD-R era.,"You're better off making your own mixes. Record company-produced compilations are generally a let down for the fans and a misrepresentation of the true band to non-fans.There are some good songs on here, but there are very few ""bad"" songs on the two individual albums, so why clump them together in a profanity-free blob while leaving out many great songs? To take your money, that's why.This thing is a bastardization of the one of the true modern epics of music. And seeing how dysfunctional the sum of parts for what was once G'n'R is now, only makes the accomplishment of the Illusion albums that much more impressive. Buy both albums if you don't have them already. And if you do have them, don't waste your time and money on this pile."
2,Wrong choices,The Use Your Illusion albums are bloated and overproduced. Somebody condensed the Ace and Deuce to one album which is a great idea that was executed wrong. Where's Civil war? Wheres you Could Be Mine? Where's Estranged? Instead we get B-sides like Perfect Crime and Bad Obsession. Don't buy this compilation! You'r better off just downloading your personal favorites and create your own Illusion.
1,here's how it shoulda gone,"1. you could be mine2. dust N' bones3. perfect crime(matter of taste )4. November rain5. civil war6. don't cry7. locomotive8. get in the ring(c'mon!!! it's a partay song)9. shotgun blues(very fun)10.yesterdays11.the garden12.dead horse13.coma14.estrangedokay, so this definatley wouldn't fit on one c.d, but oh well, they'll never make it, so who cares?"
1,What the heck is this?????,"With Use Your Illusion 1 & 2 beeing 2 albums that have guns n roses fans tossing up which are the best songs, why would they release this? Why is it they didnt just make a 2 cd disc with UYI 1 & 2?Dont bother with this, buy Use Your Illusion 1 & 2 and then you wont have to debate about which songs shouldve been on this album."
2,Record Company Screws Over Guns N' Roses Fans,"Today, a complimation of GN'R's newest albums, Use Your Illusion I and II, was released. And it was horrible. While record companies may roll in the cash from screwing over fans, this is just stupid. Nowhere on the package does it mention that these are not the original songs and that they cut portions out. Besides, its not the best of the UYI albums anyway. Where is Coma? Locomotive? Breakdown?My advice would be for you to just buy both of them and not bother to even consider buying this remixed album."
2,"Alright, I guess","I dunno what to say...I guess the correct words would be to get the Use your Illusion I, then get Use your Illusion II. There's so many hits on both of them, and 12 songs out of 30 just won't cut it. There's so many they forgot on here. Let's see...Dust n' bones, Don't damn me, others from the first one. And from the second one...14 years (maybe they have it) Shotgun Blues, Breakdown, Pretty Tied up, Locomotive, Estranged, You could be mine, So fine. The first one they didn't do so bad, but the second one was left to hang with only 3 hits. So, I suggest that you get the two regular albums instead of this. Believe me, you'll feel alot better about yourself and your money's worth. I know it's two instead of one, but there's so many classics they forgot to put on here. So, do yourself a favor. I got the two before this thing ever came out, and I don't think I'll buy it because I already have all of the hits. Trust me on this one. Buy the two originals. You'll feel better."
1,What the hell,What the hell don't be cheap buy both UYI 1 and UYI 2 not this piece of s..t mix it is worth the money I could go on for hours about what's missing here
4,Good sampler & edited Knockin On Heaven's Door,"Great album, but even the casual fan will be better served by purchasing the original Use Your Illusion I and II albums. But special note about this one: The version of ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" has the phone call portion of the song edited out! The edit is well-done and unnoticable at first. There is no explanation in the liner notes. But it is a better version as it retains the melancholic mood of the song throughout. I guess it's a good starter album for the typical pop fan as well as the uber-GNR fan who wants the edited ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door."""
5,Just Hard Rock,hmm what to say about this one ... it is just *Hard Rock* ... it is the hard rock as it must be ... as it was in '92 and as it is not now ... everyone who likes that kind of music knows both of illusions and this one is probably the best of them ..it is *a must have* one :>>>
3,This is like... the best SOFT songs on the albums,Get this if your short on cash.. or if you dont like your music a bit harder. Otherwise.. buy UYI1 and 2 seperatly.This Album is missing...ComaPerfect CrimeGarden Of EdenRight Next Door To HellBad Obessesionand needs to lose...yesterdaysknocking on heavens door (overrated!)dont cry (alt lyrics)send me a email at jacktopia@aol.com if you wanna talk gnr
2,CD,"The picture shown for this item was for the Use You Illusion set, 1 & 2.That is what I though I was buying, the set... I only got Illusion 1. So I feel I did not get what I paid for."
3,WHERES DUST N BONES?!!!!!!!,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. JUST BUY THE TWO ORIGINAL RELEASESUSE YOUR ILLUSIONS IUSE YOUR ILLUSIONS IIThat way you don't miss anything.THIS HERE IS THE ANSWER TO ANY A HOLE WHO ASKS WHY THEY DIDNT JUST MAKE UYI INTO ONE ALBUMI personally made my own ""best of"" package and it was a lot better than this half assed mix."
5,Use Your Illusion 1 & 2,"These albums are quite simply two of the best rock albums of all time. They represent the pinnacle of Guns N' Roses' musical career. The guitar genius of Slash, the lyrical genius of Axl it all combines 29 (I refuse to acknowledge 'My World' as a GN'R song) songs of pure Rock N' Roll mastery. Best songs are: Dust N' Bones, Perfect Crime, Bad Obsession, Don't Cry (Original), Garden of Eden, Bad Apples, Dead Horse, Coma, Locomotive, Estranged, You Could Be Mine, & Get In The Ring. By the way if you buy this also check out ""Ain't Life Grand"" by Slash's Snakepit (Slash's side project)."
2,No No No No.,Here is what should be the track listing to this compilation.1.Civil War2.Live and Let die3.Perfect Crime4.The Garden5.Garden of Eden6.Locomotive7.Don't Damn Me8.Bad Obsession9.You Could Be Mine10.November Rain11.Don't Cry(Original Lyrics)12.Dead Horse13.Pretty Tied UpI would have gladly put together this perfect compilation for Geffen and it would have been a great success.
4,A rocking jewel,"This entire album proves that songs with nasty grooves can have artful and intelligent, inspired lyrics. The album opens with an eclectic mix of songs that firmly stake out broad territory. Great song writing and solid playing that ""paints"" around Halford's well chosen words is the common ground. The songs that follow the opening set do not fail in delivering upon their considerable promise.The subject matter of Halford's songs deals with Hobos, lost loves, Ghosts, spousal homicide and dying soldiers and yet, somehow by the end of the CD one feels uplifted by the power of the Human spirit. Go figure.This guy is one to watch!"
3,semiconductors for solar cells,In my country(Thailand) have no this book for reading so i hope this book will be useful for me
5,Bently is Awesome!,"While I don't own a VW anymore, or a car for that matter, this book really bailed me out when it came to fixing problems with the electrical systems. The book just blows american technical manuals out of the water when it comes to useful information and explanations. Chilton's manuals are so general when it comes to foreign cars, you might as well throw them away if you have a REAL problem. I had to solve a problem with a turn signal and a couple other things and couldn't find a book in any local auto shop that would explain the fuse box at all. This book had a complete mapout of the electrical system that was nothing short of astounding.All in all, the thoroughness of this manual, and Bently manuals in general is awesome. You won't waste your money."
4,"Excellent book, but still needs more detail..","This is an excellent repair and maintenance book. However, when attempting to service my brakes, it fell short of giving a full explanation of what needed to be done. All I really wanted to do was to was replace my brake pads, but the caliper drawings were confusing and it referenced one-time-only use on the bolts holding the caliper, which is not true. A little lock tite on the bolt and you're good to go. The replacement bolts are just new bolts with lock tite already applied, and, as long as the bolt is in good shape, there is no need to replace. This should have been referenced. It also did not reference the requirement to use a special caliper piston tool on the rear calipers, since the rears need to be twisted because of the e-brake.Overall, however, this is a great book and a must-have for any 1993-99 Jetta, Golf, or Cabrio owner."
4,PROFESSSIONAL QUALITY INFORMATION,"Im a auto mechanic for a german auto maker(not vw)for over 11 yrs now. I bought this to service my vw jetta, ,mostly for specs and wiring diagrams. From a professional level this book is very good. It has lots of valuable info and specs for the diy weekend mechanic. The wiring diagrams are full and there are a ton of them. I read wiring diagrams daily for my job, but found these very difficult to follow. I feel theres too much wiring and items on each page. The wiring pics are small and its hard to follow each wire from page to page. You almost have to use a magnifing glass to follow thru the diagrams. All in all its worth the cash if you plan on servicing your own car. The chilton or other similar books have limited info, and are more geared to the diy mechanic. This book is more greared to someone who knows what parts make up a car and what makes one tick."
5,Moneysaver,I bought this book and paid extra for overnight shipping. It paid for itself within 3 or 4 days when we were able to repair our 95 Golf ourselves using this book and a little bit of diagnosis. The book is easy enough for just about anyone to use and detailed enough to make any repairs.
5,"The ""Bible"" for VW's","I have owned 3 versions of VW's (mk1, mk2, mk3) so I have owned 3 different manuals, and Mr. Bentley never fails to please! The instructions are very clear and concise, even for beginners. I recently purchased a 95 Jetta VR6 , and even though I had never done work on one I was able to do extensive work on it with the assistance of this manual. The only negative thing I found was there could be more detailed pics in some of the areas. Get this book guys, if you're a VW guy like me it's a must have!"
2,looks good from far but far from good,"As the title says, the book cover looks nice and the book is thick, however, I bought it for a problem on the airco system and before I started out, I thought I was backed by the book until I started working on the car. It gives explanations for instance in general how the airco (and besides, all the other systems)work, but the in-depth technical help is not there. So, I did not like the book, it is too general."
5,The only book you need for these cars,This is the real deal factory service manual for the mk3 Jetta/golf line of cars. Only thing missing is the transmission repair section.
1,No paint for the butterflies,This item does not include the paint you need to use the item. You can't make the sun catchers without the paint. It's useless. Don't buy it.
3,Modest performance,"I am a little bit disappointed, because I think it has a rather small orchestra, with soloist reaching to their limit. I would appreciate less vibrato with the spoprano. It is a ""middle to the road release"", but for a life recording very good recorded."
2,"Overwritten and Florid ""Exorcist"" Sequel","Where was the editor when Blatty wrote this thing? The protagonist, Lt. Kinderman, is un unbelievably cliched parody of a character, alternately spouting the worst kind of hackneyed Jewish schtick and prosing on about deeply philosophical and theological piffle. The book only begins to take off halfway through and then revs up to a confused denoument that doesn't satisfy. SOMEONE should have helped Blatty to remove chunks of Kinderman's alternately hopelessly adorable banter and (supposedly) intellectually weighty lectures on evolution and existence and God and death and meaning and everything... couldn't somebody have told Blatty that he'd veered into self-parody already??I liked ""The Exorcist."" This sequel is a diminished return, adding nothing of substance to the first book. Leave it alone."
1,Unreadable,"I picked this book up at a library book sale for about a nickel and I feel that I wasted my money. I couldn't even get through it and was bored with Kinderman's ""philosphy."" I loved the Exorcist and have never seen the Legion movie or read a review of the book so I was not influenced in any way. I just found the book boring and confusing."
2,Not as good as The Exorcist,"I've also read The Exorcist, Dimiter, and Elsewhere by William Peter Blatty. I loved The Exorcist, but none of his other novels are nearly so good. Legion includes the detective from The Exorcist, named Kinderman. Kinderman was the least interesting character from The Exorcist, and one of the reasons the book is so good is that Blatty keeps his role minor. Not so in Legion. As in his other books, it seems important to Blatty to promote Jewish identity and subculture: this may work for some readers, but I found his intellectual ponderousness distracting and mildly obnoxious. The other problem with the book is that it's a police procedural mainly. The Exorcist was no such thing: police involvement in a crime was a minor aspect of that book, and thank goodness. Again, though, other readers enjoy police procedurals. If so, this book may work for you better than it did for me."
3,Better than its prequel.,"While it is best to read ""The Exorcist"" first, I found this book to by far surpass it. It unnerved me and disturbed me and I think my jaw even dropped once or twice. If you like to sleep with the lights on, read this book!"
2,Not Enough Sunlight,"Kinderman is a cop who's investigating a series of murders smattered with blasphemy. These murders lead Kinderman to a mental patient possessed by a demon named Sunlight. Sunlight is about the only awesome part of this book and yet we see him sparingly.Legion is Blatty's sequel to The Exorcist. It is a mash-up of hardboiled detective meets the supernatural meets existential muckabout. I would have been hell and high water for this novel, but Kinderman is continually churning out philosophical asides. Geez, dude even dreams in half-ass philosophy. Ef dream sequences as literary devices and this book has plenty. If I wanted a sweet, philosophical brain melt I'd have picked up Hesse, Rand, Pirsig or Camus. Kinderman's brainwork weighs down the narrative. This book didn't move quickly for me until Sunlight becomes more of a feature near the end."
3,Blatty's Exorcist 2 a passable sequel.,"William Peter Blatty's sequel to his own smasheroo success The Exoricst only shows how impossible it is to adequately follow up a knocked-out-of-the-ballpark pop culture influencing piece of work. Certainly the novel is intelligent and provokes thought, but the theology is nothing particularly new or interesting and the mixture of plots and sub-plots (involving apparently undead serial killers, brain tumors and/or traumas, as well as a fish in a bath tub) are convoluted and aggravating instead of intriguing and suspense building. Nonetheless Legion is one of the better (if not the best) of The Exorcist sequels and fans will no doubt want to take a look, just don't expect to be as deeply unsettled as you were the first time around and you probably won't be too disappointed."
3,Sequel to The Exorcist,"This is the sequel to the Exorcist novel, the basis for what was one of the scariest movies ever made up to that point. This sequel was actually the basis for the film Exorcist III, seeing it devolve into a still going horror franchise as of the 2000s. A series of bizarre murders all bear the mark of the Gemini killer. But the Gemini kiler has been dead for 12 years. Despite its once horrifying spectacle, The Exorcist is Catholic propaganda."
2,Self-indulgent & boring,"It's no surprise ""The Exorcist"" is still going strong, while this mess has gone out of print and is available used for 27 cents. Its hero, Detective Kinderman, the only grating part of the otherwise lean and wonderful Exorcist, is front and center here. And, wow, is he a bore. Muttering, and ""philosophizing"" for pages and pages, forcing the reader to endure his supposedly charming, digressive approach to crimesolving, befrore something--anything!--happens to actually advance the plot.Blatty clearly thinks Kinderman is a genius creation; you begin to suspect that Blatty created this character as a self-portrait, and lets him drone on purely out of narcissism.If you find this book, as I did, in some dusty thrift store, leave it there."
4,Much Better Than The Movie,I thought this book was much better than the movie that was put out. It was also 100 times better than the movie Exorcist: The Heretic. The books main character is the Lee J. Cobb character Detective Kinderman from the first book and movie. I thought the story was just chilling and it was pretty damn scarey. The whole story of the serial killer and his motives was just horrifying and when Kinderman confronts the man in the padded cell... just chilling. The book was so much better than the movie cause they didn't feel the need to have a forced exorcism just because they wanted to call the movie Exorcist III. And it was much more subtle which made it more scarey and more compelling.
4,Excellent Book..... with high standards to live up to....,"I'm a freak! I read Legion before I read the Exorcist! Let me just say that Legion isn't meant to be a sequel... in my opinion. Yes... it has many same characters but many of its ideas and themes are different. And after reading ""The Exorcist"" I will admit that Legion does not have the horror or eloquent language of ""The Exorcist"" but it IS thought-provoking.. and intriguing. It's a page-turner that can not be put down! It works on many levels: a horror novel, a mystery novel, a religious novel, a novel about a family man. It's a wonderful book that shouldn't be pinholed as ""The sequel to 'The Exorcist'"" It's sooooooooooo much more."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Possessed by sequelitis.Unfortunately, Legion is pretty much a classic example of the sequel being not too flash compared to the rather entertaining original. Or, to put it more plainly, you really do not need to read this, but keen fans that find it for next to nothing in a second hand shop might want to take a look to fill in some of the goings on surrounding the milieu of the first book, or for their collection. Quite avoidable, indeed."
2,You can do better,"Good flavor and quality. Price isn't bad, but you can do much better and get Organic to boot! I recommend Nutiva instead."
2,Cheap Watch,"After having only a few months the face starched really easy after trying hard to take good care of it. The second hand fell off; I had a shop replace the battery, fix the face and put the second had back on. Just a few weeks later the second had had fallen off again. A lot of great compliments when the watch was working but a total waste of money. Won't be buying the Triumph brand again."

5,UNIGUE,"if you are sick of the same old same old from country cd's, then check this one out! great mix of tracks, ranging from slow soft melody to rip roaring rock! this is hottest cd in my collection!"
4,Photo-Guide to WWII Army & Marine Corps Paratroopers!,"At first glance, AIRBORNE ALBUM by John Andrews looks like an early Squadron/Signal publication. Same 11 x 8 1/2 format, same type style. In point of fact, this 1982 paperback was the first of several pictorial histories of elite U.S. forces published by Phillips Publications.A true rara avis, AIRBORNE ALBUM offers up a text-and-photos history of the development, equipment and combat exploits of U.S. Army and Marine Corps paratrooper and glider units. The book features concise but informative information on units like the Parachute Test Platoon, various 82nd and 101st Airborne battalions, 1st Special Services Force, the abortive USMC parachute battalions, OSS units, etc.The book features over 100 photos and dozens of drawings of weapons, uniforms, insignia, etc. The book really manages to cram a great deal of information into its 52 pages.Long out of print, AIRBORNE ALBUM is a neat, little overview to some hard-fighting warriors. Recommended."
5,So nice I had to have it twice!,"After my last copy grew legs and disappeared, I had to go on-line and order another one! This book dignafies African-American men such a way that I have used it as a source of encouragement for the young men who attend the high school that I work for. This is a must have. The seller was very prompt in shipping the book and I received it within two or three days."
1,Long Life Bulbs,"Now that I've put two into use, I have to say I wouldn't have bought them if I had seen them in use first. They cast a yellowish light and don't give off 100 Watt light! More like a 60 Watt. I'll use them where they're usable and light quality doesn't matter.This in no way reflects on the seller. They were really good at packaging and shipping on time."
1,Not what I ordered,This is NOT a DVD Audio disc...it doesn't say it on the package and does not play in either a DVD Audio Player or a regular CD player.
4,Good true crime book,"I had heard of the Karla Brown case on Unsolved Mysteries so when I came across this book, I had to have it. Don Weber does an excellent job in making the reader really care about the victim and victim's family in this case. Unlike a lot of true crime books which only focus on the murderer, Weber spent a lot of time focused on Karla Brown's surviving family members. You really feel as if you knew the people in this case, whether it be family members of the victim, the detectives involved in the case, and the suspects themselves. A lot of time is spent really giving you a look at all the different people involved in this murder case."
4,Nice pen,"This was my first purchase from this pen manufacturer. It is nicely made and the cartridge is smooth. The ""leather"" like wrapping is a little cheap looking, but didn't expect real leather.I bought 3 different versions. I liked the bamboo version the most."
3,I like half of this album.,The instrumentalists are fine. I don't like the singers. I had hoped for more from this Bononcini. Ensemble 415 and Carlos Mena put out a luscious Bononcini recording a few years ago which this recording does not match. Too bad.P
5,munchener freiheit Definitive collection Wow! Great!,If your a fan of this group you must get this CD! You will not be disappointed;Munchener Freiheit is truly Timeless music!
3,Usually we love Bollywood but..,"We usually love Bollywood films, yet this one we just could not get into. The story started off choppy and storyline did not make sense until about an hour into the film."
3,"Poor fit, slightly under capacity","This battery works as a replacement, but I would have to think there are better options out there.When I first installed the battery i could tell instantly that it was not going to fit properly. The sliver back of the battery is about 1mm too big, and the edge of the battery sits OVER the back of the laptop, bending the edge of the battery's back a little. I felt like I was going to break something while I essentially forced the battery into its spot.The battery claims to be 4400mAh, however my system info application showed 4100 when it was first installed.Bottom line: I bought this battery at a fraction of the cost of an Apple battery, so I didn't expect it to be the same quality. If you find it at a good price it will get the job done, but I wouldn't pay too much for this battery."
4,Decent Battery,"The charge isn't as long as the factory battery, but it is good enough. It will last about 2-3 hours on a full charge. Great price, and shipping was fast to California. I would recommend this to friends and family."
4,"Good, solid charger- the price makes up for any deficiencies","I just got the battery, today and it gives me about 3 1/2 hours of battery life. I still need to charge it fully to see, but I'm so much happier not having to cart my charger around. Only downside like some people mentioned is the color is slightly off and it doesn't set so perfectly in the machine. However, my laptop is already pushing 5 years, so I feel it gives it character. Besides, 40 dollars vs. 125 at apple (also apple's reviews of this product weren't that great- at least not 125 great)- I don't really think there is any competition. Even if this only lasts a year, I'll still have saved money compared to buying an apple battery. Also, for anyone who complains about the color- it's on the bottom no one will see, and it looks pretty much the same."
4,good but not great,the look and fit of the battery is fine. the power seems ok but obviously it's too soon to tell how long it will last. the test button fell off right away. great seller. i'm pleased overall.
3,Sufficient replacement battery,"I bought this for my six year old 12"" PowerBook G4. This is the second replacement battery that I have purchased for this computer. The first one was an official Apple battery from the Apple store. I didn't want to spend $120+ since my goal is to just get this computer to last my another year until I can get a new one.The battery is a slightly different silver but my computer is so banged up after six years that it didn't bother me. It lasts a little over two hours when fully charged which isn't fantastic but for $45 I'll take it."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good battery. As others have mentioned, it isn't exactly like the original Apple battery aesthetically, but it works pretty well. I think I am getting about 2 hours out of it, although I feel like the battery life is already dwindling a bit after just about a month of use. However, as the PowerBook G4 is an older model, I didn't want to spend $100 on a new Apple battery that would outlive the computer. So, I""m happy with this battery overall."
1,I bought this battery a month ago.,"The battery showed up on time, and the packaging was sufficient. I calibrated it and got 1 full charge out of it. On the second charge the battery stopped taking a charge at 7%. I used it till my computer shut down, and tried charging it again. This battery will no longer take a charge, and I am back to plugging in my laptop. Ugh. $25 and a month later, and I'm back to lugging my power cord around."
2,good for a few months,"the battery does not work now.i had to take the battery out of the cradle all summer to get a charge that last 2 hours tops. if you need a cheap replacement for 4-5 months or a back up spare, if not there are other replacement battery options than apple or other internet sites. I wish could recommend a non-amazon place that specializes in other mac products."
1,"Works Electonically, but does not fit--scratches desk top.","Battery Apple Powerbook G4 12 Replaces M8984 M9324 A1022 A1079This computer battery was not made to exact form and fit specs because, although it works electonically, it works does not fit--scratches desk top. The outside of the battery is aluminum, just like the computer case, but one edge and one end stick up about one milimeter. That makes the battery unacceptable.I have emailed my request for a replacement back to the seller via Amazon.We'll see?"
3,Battery replacement powerbook G12,"The battery is cheaper than other sites, so I can't complain too much. It works fine and holds a charge. The Problem is that it does not install ""flush"" to the edges. It sticks out about 3/16"" which does BUG me. Also, The color is ""off"" a shade or two which does not bother me. In conclusion, I would probably spend alittle more next time for a better fitting replacement."
4,good replacement for the price,"The shine on the metal surface of the battery is only slightly off, but considering I've had my good o' G4 Powerbook for years, I'm sure the original color of my laptop was probably closer to the battery. Good battery life so far (I calibrated it), works really well. My only issue is that the little rubber leg is slightly smaller than the rest of the legs on my laptop, so it kind of tilts, but I've solved that by sticking a dime under that leg when I'm working on a table."
3,"Adequate, but I wanted more.","It works just fine, but it will only hold a three hour charge. It'd be nice if it held a larger one."
4,No Reason to Assault this Battery,"Is the color of the battery ever so slightly different from the rest of the case? Yes. But since these computers are oldish and most have oxidized or at least gotten a tad dirty, I'd have to think that even a brand new Apple battery wouldn't be a 100% match visually. Trust me, nobody else will notice this battery's lack of Appleness, and you'll feel you've gotten a fine replacement and saved a few bucks. Battery life is way longer than my mostly drained original, and though I haven't clocked it, I'd estimate that it goes for a few hours and then some.Okay, now you can quit using up your old battery and stop reading these reviews . . ."
4,"Nor perfect, but better than Apple's replacement","Most people that have a 12"" Powerbook have had major issues with their batteries after a recall provided us with an inferior (but safer) product. This is my third battery, and every indication was that another original Apple battery was going to have the same problems. At less than half the price of Apple's battery, this was worth the risk. After all, a 4-year old PowerBook has about half the speed and grace of a new MacBook. The fit and finish are no where near the original (plastic instead of aluminum, no rubber ""foot,"" less-than-precise fit, etc), but the insides seem to be fine. I can only speak for it's short term performance, as I've only put it through two charging cycles. If I was really looking for long charge times, I could by two of these for the price of one of the others. By the way, the seller shipped this to me in ONE DAY! That was great."
3,Slight misfit but works OK,"As other reviewers have warned, the replacement battery is not a precise fit. It would not seat with less than 1mm lip of its shell protruding, esp on the RH (latching) side. I took a mechanic's small file to the oversized edges of the shell. The shell material looks like aluminum, but is actually plastic, and files easily. After a few rounds of filing/trying the fit, it seated better, not perfect but acceptable. After one day's use I'm satisfied with the battery's performance, it ran a 2-hour DVD with no problem. Next time I'd spend a few more bucks and get an exact replacement, tho."
3,"Terrible fit, but works","Upon receiving the battery I went to replace the old battery, but the battery did not fit in the laptop the same way. The replacement's plastic cover that is supposed to look like the body does not fit in the cutouts. I had to sand the edges down to get it to fit. The battery works, but does not have a ton of life to it."
3,Works but not perfect,"This seems like a great battery except for the fit in the laptop. I really had to work to get it to seat properly in my G4. It also sticks up above the case a hair, which is no big deal but I am more careful with it as I hate messing with getting the battery in and out. Better construction would solve these problems."
2,Don't wast even $2 on this,"Beyond disappointing! VERY little information (pick any link from the first page of a google search, you'll learn more about hiatal hernias). And very little helpful information, ALL of which is again available from even the simplest web search.I feel like a sucker that I spent $2.30 on this pamphlet (actually, that's overstating, most pamphlets are longer)."
1,Fast forward review,"For sex sleaze fans, we got one star here for the can't miss nail gun scene, with an attractive young nude girl scrambling around showing all her goodies before getting . . . uh, nailed. Very sexy.The rest is some limited gore stuff and a bunch of catch the killer plot, yawn. Not enough nudity, not enough sleaze, but the nail gun scene is essential."
3,Hammy Cheeeze...,"THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is a wonderfully cheeezy 70s movie w/ a boffo beginning, a rather looonng, dull middle, and a semi-interesting finale. It starts out as a bloody murder story, then morphs into a bizarre Hardy Boys-type mystery, and winds up w/ more gooshy deaths! It must have seemed shocking to see women killed by various tools in 1978. Alas, by today's standards this is routine at best. Still, if you like 70s horror, and Cameron Mitchell (THE DEMON) doesn't remind you too much of Bill T. Shatner, then TTM could be a nice diversion..."
2,Dull Slasher Flick,"The Toolbox Murders (1977) is a misleading movie. The first thirty minutes are non-stop carnage and t & a. It makes you think that you're watching a good exploitation/slasher film. However, after that first half hour the movie takes a completely different direction. It becomes a dull psychological drama. There are no more toolbox murders. No more nudity. Just a bunch of boring dialogue that's often lame as well. Also, I have to point out that this movie was remade a few years back by Tobe Hooper. Hooper's movie is far better and really isn't anything like this one. You should watch that one instead since I would give that 4/5. I can only give this one 2/5, and that's just for the first thirty minutes. After that, you should just turn it off if you value your time."
4,Toolbox Murders.... A Slasher Great,"The Toolbox Murders is an preety low budget slasher, which in my opinion, is very entertaining and delivers the goods. I really enjoyed it. It may be contraversial, sadistic, and the direct opposite of Oscar worthy material, but If you enjoy violence, beautiful women and cinematic savegrey... this is the film for you. I do not own the DVD, but since it was released by Blue Underground, im sure its immaculate. Find a copy, and enjoy."
1,The Toolbox Murders,"Based on what true story? the film is just shock for the pure sake of shock kind of a seventies saw minus the gore,the movie has it's moments but it belongs where it came from,It also apparently has a bone to pick with fundamentalism.I saw the remake first which is Ultra-Violent and an improvement if you can call it that, but both films are garbage and disturbing,I'll stick with my watered down horror flicks and leave the ultra violent stuff elsewhere."
2,RENT b4 you buy,"One piece of advice rent b4 you buy. I personally did not like the film and consider it a waste of money. all the murders happen in the begining of the film, they are not gory and , I dont know I just didnt like it. Like I say rent b4 you buy, you might like it i know i didnt AT ALL."
4,Hmmm.....,I like the way this one starts with the 70's atmosphere. Picture quality is good and movie grabs your interest from the start. I found the middle to be painfully slow and the ending so so. I would recommend this one for the first 30 minutes only. It's not that great overall but a decent movie to add to the collection.
3,Tool box murders,My three stars are for the first 40 minutes of gore. Generally the filmmakers don't make these films in in these days.Concluding I Would like to say that amount of gore is not enough and Dario Argento and Jess Franco make better giallos than this one.
3,70s sleeze in High Definition!,"The original Toolbox Murders was a bona-fide guilty pleasure back in the 70s, and it remains so to this very day. What happens when a handyman goes on a murderous rampage through an LA apartment complex, taking out ""immoral"" women? Plenty of blood, gore, and nudity that's what! For what it is, The Toolbox Murders is an exercise in inventive slasher movie perceptions. It offers some decent examples of bloody brutality, yet also manages to be as cheesy as it is sleezy. In those regards, it's worth seeing if you've never seen it before, or have only seen the Tobe Hooper remake that came out a few years back. Blue Underground managed to produce another standout Blu-Ray disc, which features the film in a silky smooth transfer and intriguing extras including an insightful commentary track, a documentary/retrospective, and the usual assortment of trailers and TV spots to round things out here."
5,great movie,a little sad but also very good and inspiring. don't wanna spoil the story but if you can't take a some sadness in your movie watching don't go for this movie. otherwise i really like it
5,i HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE MANY TIMES BUT LOST IT,i JUST WANTED TO HAVE A COPY BECAUSE i LOST THE COPY i HAD ON DVR-I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE AND FEEL SAFER NOW WITH A COPY IN MY HANDS
5,I true love story.,This is a prefect love story. How a person can love someone beyond your death. Even when you are dead that person Happiness is the most important thing to you. P.S I Love It.
4,Good movie,I liked the soundtrack as well as the story. One of the few movies i can watch more than once.
4,Passionate love,"A high-strung young woman in love with her affable Irish husband realizes too late that she should have treasured her moments with him. His patient love reaches out beyond his untimely death to show her how to keep living, and to love again."
4,Far better than I imagined - and Hilary is radiant!,"I just watched this ""On Demand,"" and was very pleasantly surprised! I'd seen the DVD box in stores for months, and was never moved to rent it; little did I know that I'd end up thinking it was one of the best romantic movies I'd seen in years. I'm a guy who doesn't immediately label a good love story a ""chick flick"" - ANY kind of movie that is driven by character and plot can hold my interest, and the best ones prompt me to write songs. I just finished one, because certain things about ""P.S. I Love You"" made me think of my own life.P.S - I've never seen Hilary Swank look so gorgeous."
4,Worth it,I had mixed feelings about this movie.. at times I almost abandoned watching it - wasn't sure where it was going early on.. but stick with it. It is well done - a look at raw emotions going through the grieving process. Not so intense that it wears you out - and in the end everyone comes out in the sunshine. Worth the watch!
5,P.S. I Love You,"This movie is a real tearjerker. I liked the plot very much. It deals with grief and how society or family expects young widowed people to deal with the grief. It also deals with guilt and regret: the thing we wish we would have done or said to our loved ones before their tragic and untimely death. It is a film that makes you think about your loved ones, about not taking them for granted. It is a beautiful movies. I wish I had discovered this movie before I became widowed at a young age.----Larry"
1,One of the worst movies ever!!,"I was looking forward to a love story, but ended up wasting time watching one of the top 10 worst movies ever.Why would straight woman spend time at a gay man bar? The Hillary Swank character's husband isn't dead 5 minutes and already she's out man hunting. Hillary and her hubby were arguing in the beginning they couldn't afford to have a baby, yet hubby can afford tickets to Ireland for Hillary and her 2 friends. The man is dying of brain cancer, yet is well enough to write and send all these letters. PHONEY!!!! OH...and what was with the annoying sister? Who hired that girl???I didn't even bother watching to the end b/c a person can only take so much torture."
1,"There should be a ""zero"" rating.","Pass on Swank, although I realize the Director, and others, rule. But horribly miscast. Pass on the script. Pass on the direction. The supporting cast was there, talented, and ready to work and they got the shaft.I can hear the Director: ""Kathy, Lisa please be your sterotypes.""Please, actors: save your money so that you can turn down wretched roles.Apart from that, I am appalled that women reviewers like this film. If you are really like this Holly character, then we're all doomed.If you watch more than 3 minutes of this movie, you will feel you should do penance for enabling it."
1,Not Happy,"My movie was delievered in a timely fashion, and that was great, but the DVD was listed as ""Very Good"" and when I got the movie, the second hour of the movie wouldn't play because it skips so bad. I will not be buying from this seller again. I was very dissatisfied"
5,ANOTHER RENTAL MUST HAVE,MY DAUGHTER WANTED THIS @ XMAS & COULDNT FIND IT ANYWHERE WHEN I WANTED TO BUY IT!!SWEET LOVE STORY. THANK YOU AMAZON
5,Best Love Story In A Long Time,"Excellent movie. Great true love story with a complete twist.If you loved The Notebook then you will love ""P.S. I Love You""."
5,PS I Love You,"This was an excellent movie. My new favorite romantic comedy. Hilary Swank is a two-time Oscar winner who proves that she can do romantic fluff as well as the next leading lady. She has incredible chemistry with Gerard Butler, who has not been getting the best roles of his career. He is far underestimated, in my view, and I hope to see him in more romantic comedies."
3,Not As Emotional As I Expected,"I liked P.S. I Love You more than I thought I would but didn't love it. I absolutely hate being manipulated emotionally and that is what I expected but most of the relationship between Holly (Swank) and Gerry (Butler) is revealed through flashbacks. The movie starts with an annoying and somewhat amusing overtly long fight between the couple. The next scene shows his funeral so the viewer doesn't get too caught up in the story of them, ending up chewing fingernails in dread waiting for the moment the story changes in a bad way.A feel good chick-flick where the heroine moves out of a rut, wins self-respect and becomes a better person for surviving pain.A naked man backside parades across the screen and Lisa Kudrow's character plays the field like a talented trout fisherwoman...(is that PC?) tossing bait out and whipping it back, moving with the current til the prize fish bites. I wouldn't recommend it for family viewing or if you are annoyed by the genre."
5,Love lives on,"Having been widowed, I found this movie not only very realistic but very uplifting. Holly finds starting over after the death of her husband easier because of Jerry's last act of love for his wife. He knew how to help her heal and begin a new life because he knew her best.Grief is accurately depicted as crushing without bogging the film down in sentiment or floods of tears. This film is proof that our loved ones remain with us, and life goes on."
2,Nothing like book,"I held off on watching this movie until I had read the book. I wish I hadn't. It was very loosely based on the book. Had the movie been more like the book, it would have been fantastic."
5,Great story-great cast,"Very entertaining movie.(I've heard that's what movies are supposed to be) Great casting and I thought it was very believable. Gerard Butler has charisma and is an excellent actor. Hillary Swank was very good. The whole cast was excellent. I've seen the movie 5 times. I finally gave up and bought the DVD after seeing it 3 times. I'm old but in my life time, I've only seen 3 men actors just jump off the screen; one was Paul Newman in the Long, Hot Summer, 2nd was Brad Pitt in Thelma and Louise and 3rd is Gerard Butler in this movie. I've ordered two more movies with G.B. starring. It's too bad the way the movie was marketed. I had no desire to see it after seeing trailers of the movie. I saw it one night & fully anticipated that I would probably turn it off. Needless to say to say, I loved it. Even bought the musical score!"
4,Four and a Half stars if you want the truth (spoilers),"This was a simple love story, nothing necessarily unique here, but I loved it.I would have liked to see more of Butler's and Swank's relationship, but the flashbacks were great. There were a few scenes that were hilarious, and the script was nicely written. The 'funny stuff' flowed well into the more touching scenes, and none of the actors 'tried too hard.' I am a fan of James Marsters, and it was great to see him in a more adult role. Gina Gershon was toned down from her usual sex pot roles, and I loved her in this movie. Lisa Kudrow was a hoot, and Kathy Bates had the right amount of concern for her hurting daughter. I was pleasantly surprised that Swank carried off the comedy as well as she did, and her Karaoke scene was hilarious! But I admit it, I watched for Butler and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who was not in it as much as I would have liked.And let's not forget Harry Connick Jr. He stole every scene he was in.Great movie."
4,Pretty Good,"Hilary lights up the screen and so does her co-star. Good acting jobs including a co-starring role from the great Kathy Bates. (Remember ""Misery??)Good story, and a great movie to watch with my wife Debbie.Jeffrey Dean Morgan is also extremely good in a supporting role. Like the guitar playing :)"
5,5 Boxes of Kleenex needed,"This is one of my favorite love stories. I HAD to have it for my library of DVDs!!!! Definitely Chick-flik, but I saw some emotion with my husband out of the corner of my eye."
3,What a great movie to nap during!,"I bought this for my wife for mother's day. She saw it in the theater and really loved it. So, I sat down to watch it with her and was passed out cold on the couch within 5 minutes. I woke up refreshed as the end credits were rolling. That's the only way to enjoy a sappy chick flick! Guys, I highly reccomend it if you're tired."
5,Great movie with your girl,"Really a good movie, wish I could be so creative when my time comes. A must see with your girl"
5,Sweet romantic movie,This was an excellent romantic movie. Sad but very sweet story about a couple who shared a deep unselfish love
2,Good but not the best.,"The DVD was in good condition but 3/4 into the movie it stopped working, I was able to forward past the part but I missed about 15 minutes of the movie and that was disapointing."
1,P.S. I love you,"I have not recieved the movie I order, so I can't review it. Please check to when it will be shipped."
1,NEVER RECEIVED!!!!!!,"Well here it is five weeks since I ordered this movie & I still haven't received it! I also haven't had a response from seller or Zodiac Movies to my request in tracking purchase. MY OPINION....never doing this online again. They were quick to charge my account on June 2, the date I placed the order & my credit card company paid them, but I NEVER received merchandise. Shame on you."
1,P.S. My name is Hillary Swank and I'm a spolied brat,"P.S. I'm Dead would be another good title. Hillary Swank is such a spoiled girl in her movies that she ruins romance in every one of them. I think her goal in life is to convince girls everywhere that romance is to treat your guy like crap and he will coming running to you because of it. The Dumbook, That other one where channing tatum runs around kissing her feet for two hours; they are all the same movie."
3,Hardcore chick flick,"This is a total chick flick! Not saying anything bad about it, just being honest! Both my daughters loved it, but then again they're girls!"
2,"Good idea, bad execution.","This movie kind of seems to hate women. From the neurotic main character, the crass best friend, to the unreasonable but ultimately loving mom, all the women in this movie are really hard to relate to. The men on the other hand are all handsome, kind and insightful with token superficial flaws. They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women ""don't know what they want"" (as stated by female protagonist). I have to admit, it was genius giving the new love interest turrets so it wouldn't be socially unacceptable for him to move in on a widow. Though I love Nellie McKay, my girlfriend observed that it seemed like she was making fun of the movie. There were a lot weak rom-com cliches, and contrived drama when I was hoping for a movie that had the worst and best moments love has to offer. I feel like this movie at it's core had a lot of potential but it was just poorly executed."
3,P.S.......,A nice film but has too many flaws for me to appreciate. Lisa Kudrow is disgusting EVEN if she is right about a lot of men it doesn't mean she had to lower herself to their standards! It isn't for the whole family because of the language and bedroom scenes.
5,Chick Flick With Depth,"This film takes the boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and lives happily ever after and sets it all on its ear. The formula here is girl lives happily with boy until he's taken from her by brain cancer, whereupon she loses herself. The satisfying ending comes only when his letters, written before his death to guide her recovery, help her wade her way through their past to find her future. It's clever, funny and fresh (if you can take the leap of faith and go with it), and the cast is excellent.Unfortunately, the extras are lacking. The most interesting to me is the deleted scene at the travel agency, the only time we see the hero while he's dying, but with his sense of humor still very much alive.If you're in the mood to laugh a lot through a few tears, this movie is perfect for you."
2,P.S. - I'm bored,"Sloth-like in pace, poorly editied, with many trite scenes. I'm sure I'll get hammered for this review. I don't mind a decent chic flic, but this one trudges along with many dull scenes and overall lack of imagination or humor. Of course, after she receives just the right amount of letters from her dead husband, she gets her groove back. Ho-hum."
4,Crazy Hot Mess,"when this movie was over, that was how my husband described me, wrapped in my snuggie, tissues, a heaving hot mess of tears. i fought watching this movie for at least 4 years after it came out because i hate sappy love stories. This is a tearjerker for sure. I will NEVER watch it again. Ever. Great movie, but i like to walk away with a huge smile on my face, not tear stained and hollow and thinking about life. But if you like movies like that, this is for you."
4,Surprise,"I originally rented this movie thinking it was a light romantic comedy to watch alone one evening. WRONG! If that is what you are looking for, do not watch this movie. I do not particularly care for sappy movies such as The Notebook, Titanic, etc. This was not sappy, it was heart wrenching. That being said, it was a very moving movie. There were some laughs, but not a comedy. Beautiful scenery, beautiful people, beautiful story."
4,mixed,So of course I like the movie but lets talk about shipping...took way too long to get here. Ordered it on the 17th didn't get it until the 27th of course they promised to have it here by the 22nd.
1,ITS LIKE KISSING MY SISTER!!!!!!,"Yea, cant really believe people are giving this 4 stars on average. I do agree Hillary Swank did a overall great job as well as Harry Jr. as the side character. Actually I would of given this movie 4 out of 5 if not for one scene in which I think ruins the movie.The whole ""You kiss like my sister"" and ""oh I'm glad you think so to"" scene. ""oh lets be friends"" Yea horribly acted and totally unrealistic. Besides the whole way he says it justs gives me the creeps and a few laughs since. I know his character is brash but come on. Could of done that scene a thousand other ways....ok ok this is based on book which I have not read, and based on that scene I surely wont be reading. I guess overall good movie but when you see the scene with Yankee stadium....turn off the sound for about 3 min. Then I imagine it could be a satisfying movie."
5,Stupid sappy movie.,Grabbed my heart. I cried through the entire thing. In my top 10 favorites of all time. :)
2,Uninventive and boring,"The plot line seemed interesting but I could not buy the characters. Most of the emotion in this movie was so contrived that it took away from the value of the movie.I think this movie would have benefit from lower budget actors and a slight script re-write that could (hopefully) result in more empathy from an audience. Instead, the movie attempted to shoe horn actors and actresses with huge screen presence into very limited character roles."
5,P.S. I love you,LOVE this movie. Did not know how sexy Gerard Butler could be. mmmm. Or that shoes could think.
4,great product,The movie is one of my favourites I love the story soo romantic. The dvd worked great!
4,More than the typical romance movie.,"I enjoyed this one(though I love most romance movies) more than usual. Mainly because most of the movie is not about some girl trying to get some relationship (girl and boy meet through some miracle, attraction, fight and get back together...). What she goes through and how coaches her through the grief is awesome and even though the result is not (like usually) immediate she ends up finding her way."
4,An Unexpected Pleasure,"Usually I can't stand movies of this sort (""The Notebook"", ""A Walk in the Clouds"", etc.), but I must say I was pleasantly surprised after watching this film.A friend of mine brought it to my home one evening for a girl-talk + manicure session, and an inner part of me groaned...""Oh no -- here comes cheesiness...""I felt guilty for looking down on this movie before even watching it, because after thoroughly enjoying it I realized how wrong a person can be when he or she jumps to naive conclusions.Is this story cheesy? In many ways, yes. Movies of this sort usually are.BUT -- the reason why this movie overcomes its groan factor is because Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler are so believable. I didn't think they'd have much chemistry, but they make the story work.I won't ruin the movie for you, but it's a cute story that leaves one with pangs of longing for something beautifully similar to happen to herself.I hate this kind of movie. And yet I love this movie. I need therapy."
4,"GREAT idea,Wonderfull Acting,P.S.somethings missing","I couldn't wait to see this film just by watching the trailer,but the trailer is the movie.P.S.is still entertaining,and worth seeing,but its confussing sometimes.This movie should have been one of the biggest hits of 2008,but somethings missing,and I don't know what.The idea is original,the acting wonderfull,but P.S.its not a great film."
4,suprisingly good,"I was surprised how much I liked this movie. Most of it is pretty predictable and not a little sappy (sorry, praising with faint d**ns), but the way Butler guides Swank through their history (backwards) and her grief is kind of sweet and maybe even a little clever. The supporting cast is good, especially Connick and Kudrow, and of course it doesn't hurt that what we see of Ireland is drop-dead gorgeous."
3,Eh. It's an alright movie,"This movie was ok. Not one that you'd want to watch over and over. That's just my opinion though. I also might be just a little bias on it since I read the book before seeing it. The book was so awesome and I was so excited to see the movie and then blah. I think if I had seen the movie without reading the book my opinion of it might be a little better. I didn't like who they picked to play Holly's sister. She SUCKED. She reminded me of a cartoon character for little kids. The movie omitted some very important characters that were included in the book and honestly, I'm still trying to figure out why. All in all, if I could go back in time to when I bought the movie, I wouldn't buy it. Buy the book instead."
4,Gerard Butler singing,"For those who did not know that Gerard Butler could sing, he played the Phantom in the movie version of Phantom of the Opera. So no surprise that he can sing. If you have not seen his performance in that movie, buy or rent it. Exceptional."
2,P.S. I love you,"Nice, yet predictable love story. Entertaning, yet more of a movie for renting, not purchasing."
4,Wonderful tearjerker,"Okay, I'm biased. I bought the movie because Gerard Butler is in it. What I discovered was a funny, sad and always emotional film. I loved the quirkiness of Lisa Kudrow's character. As always Gerard Butler is sweet, charming, and oh so good looking. I was relieved they left out most of his illness, only showing one scene while Jerry was ill.The music was really wonderful. Unfortunately, in the CD Gerard's songs were not included. His rendition of I'll Love You 'Til the End is really touching.This is most definitely a chick flick, but guys should probably watch it for some romantic tips.The trip to Ireland was really a nice addition to the film. The book was placed in Ireland and so the trip was to Spain. The producers chose to send Holly and her friends to Ireland to include it in the film and it made for a nice touch.Good film and I'm happy to have purchased it.JJ:>)"
1,Tripe,"The worst contrivance I've seen in awhile. Ordinarily, I get a lump in my throat during commercials. There was no surprise here, to me. Not a tear was shed. I almost wish I had bought the physical copy so I could throw it out.I swear I'm not heartless. I just thought this was really bad."
1,Nope,"Didn't get very far in this movie. The first scene was okay. The second scene I couldn't even get past. The memorial service is pretty cheesy, but very ""New York."" If you like seeing a memorial service at a bar with lots of weird people around, this just may be your sort of movie...Maybe I was just not in the right mood."
3,PS I Love You sound track,"Purchased the sound track believing that all the songs that are in the movie would be on the CD, THEY ARE NOT! Actually, it pissed me off! The two songs that I really loved are not on the freakin CD, WTF?Hell, the Pulp Fiction has everything on it including discussions between Samuel Jackson and John Travolta - How a SOUND TRACK should be!Songs we loved and purchased the CD for and they are no where to be found!1. Gerard Butler - ""Galway Girl"".2. The funeral song!Now, I have to figure out how to get these elsewhere. A real bummer."
4,lovely film,"There are no words to discribe how lovely this film is, frist off i would like to say thatit was warming and heart felt also very unexpected if u don't know what im talking aboutyou will have to watch it to find out.-movie girl out!"
4,I love this movie!,I really enjoyed this movie... I bought the book too. I am hoping that the parts that I loved about the movie will be even greater in the book. Hillary Swank was fantastic!
2,dissappointing,"I personally did not care for this movie as it seems to be really slow. This movie would be good for someone who has lost a wife or husband, not so much for just an average viewer. Hillary Swank was not able in my opinion to bring the emotion to the film that was needed."
5,"Sad but wonderful story, charming cast, incredibly beautiful music!","This romantic comedy makes light of a terrible situation with humor, adventure, and love. Bravo for the music selection! You will laugh and cry but, inevitably, fall in love with the message! Chick flick!"
3,"3.5, Not Too Bad For A Chick Flick",There are some funny and touching moments to the movie. I had a hard time believing Swank in this role though. She just didn't seem to fit.Overall it was a decent movie. It was worth watching.
5,Great things to buy,"The Simple Life DVD, Britney Spears In The Zone DVD, Christina Agulera Live In The UK DVD,Attomic Kitten DVDS and cd's are great to buy if your girly or love blondes!"
3,GOOD but could of been GREAT!,"For their first concert is was not a bad attempt,the camera's and the settings could have been a lot better. Atomic kitten just did not have a polished presence. With any group PRACTICE makes perfect. I love their cd's and I'm glad I purchased this dvd.Maybe later down the road another dvd will be available."
2,Support This Film!,"This film has a powerful storyline and a necessary message to get across to the youth of today and tomorrow. Actor/Model Shaheed Shaheed is dynamic, charming and brilliant as the lead character ""Smooth"". The supporting cast is excellent as well. I really enjoyed this film; I hope all who see it will enjoy it as well... Keep up the good work!"
3,Not the original,"This is a set of the remake of the program from the 1970's and not the original. Having watched the original as a young child, the remake just does not 'cut it' for me."
3,Chapters can be organized better,"This book provided a decent introduction to ACE. However, language is little terse and presentation is not as good as ACE Programmer's book. I most liked the boxed explanations in the book, this style should have been all over the book."
4,Excellent reading for any network programmer,"This is an excellent reading for any network programmer. More than ACE itself the concepts covered are of a great value. I am a beginner to intermediate network programmer, but an experienced programmer otherwise, and found this to be an extremely valuable resource in terms tackling large application frameworks from the ground up. The concepts are precise upto the point but extremely easy to read and digest. Of course, the book is assuming that you know quite a bit of every thing else that is not covered here. There are quite a bit of things that are totally missing or not correct based on the OS and the advances in Posix threading. Nevertheless this is an excellent source for any network programmer."
2,Gorka is great but not this time!,Having seen John Gorka in Concert 5 times and owning all of his albums I consider myself a fan but the only word I can use for this CD is droll. I always look forward to John's new albums but this left me cold. It is just boring! Maybe I can use it to lull my children to sleep or anyone else for that matter.
3,Saint Caffeine is Awesome!,"Bought this CD so I could have Saint Caffeine, and I didn't preview the other songs on the CD. They are OK, but aren't particularly memorable. I should have just bought the MP3 of the one song I wanted."
4,Getting better and better,"This is my favorite Gorka album to date. Should appeal to those of us who appreciate Mr. Gorka's warm, funny side (which really comes out when you see him live) more than those who like the moody, sad songs from the older stuff. Fave tracks: Cypress Trees, Silvertown, St. Caffeine."
5,Fantastic album,"I only love this album more after having seen John Gorka in concert. From the humorous songs on the album to the touching, this is a must have addition to any folk collection."
5,Fun stuff,"As a ""true-blue"" Jump5 fan, I own all their CD's - and this was the next one on my list of Cd's to buy. It's really good, and one of the tracks isn't (to my knowlidge, anyway)available anywhere else.1.Throw Your Hands Up - Yay, this song is sooo cool! It features both the girls and the guys in a pretty even amount of the song (50/50), and is a great dance song. it definately has an A*Teens vibe to it. 5/52.Throw Your Hands Up (Remix) - This isn't as good as the original, but it's good for a remix. It's just a little slower w/more bass. 4/53.Start Jumpin' - This song is great, but it DEFINATELY has a Christian vibe. This is their most ""Christian"" song, but really good. The beat/lyrics are awesome! 5/5Great CD, definately buy it.Overall grade - A+"
3,Poor Review,I just couldn't get into it at all. The style of writing is haphazard as the author jumps in leaps and bounds over the tragic events.I didn't expect a novel but I expected a coordinated approach.Anyway I gave it a half dozen attempts and finally discarded the book. It's the first time I've ever thrown a book away.Thank you for asking.Bob
1,Feminist poppycock,"There's nothing to do with feminist aspirations about this case. It was a clear case of cold-blooded murder/torture. Gertrude was no feminist but a haggard angry addict described by her own son as ""an old pill-head."" To call this a feminist case is absurd."
3,Chilling,"This book is very well written, but not as chilling as ""The Indiana Torture Slaying!"" Kate Millett seems to voice her own opinion, along with the facts from the first book. As I said in my review about the first book, it's really a sickening crime, especially when you grew up and went to school with them, and living right down the street. This crime happened about a year or so after we moved to Indpls. And to think that it could have been one of us. I have two other sisters and a brother that played down at there house alot, when we all lived in Beech Grove. I ""DO NOT"" believe that the punishment for these cold blooded killers was hardly long enough! And death for the leader of this killer clan, was none too soon........."
4,A chilling account of a most heinous crime,"The Basement by Kate Millett is a graphically chilling account of the torture-murder of Sylvia Likens. It is all the more gruesome in that the perpetrators were mostly children led by one derranged adult. This book however, tells the story from many chilling prospectives, that of killer(s), victim, court trranscripts, and the author's most unique view of a hideous crime....a must for true-crime buffs."
1,Do not buy this CD,The artist has informed Amazon that this is an illegal CD. Jesse's name - well known to the folk community is misspelled on the cover! That should be warning enough to STAY AWAY. Get Live at Mountain Stage and get some happy!
1,Don't Buy This Recording!,"Shame on you, Amazon, for selling this bootleg recording, which is not authorized by the writer/performer!"
1,Another bootleg from Amazonia,"Illegally produced and a rip off of the talents of a great artist.Poor quality of sound, should be a 0 star but there is no provisions for doing this. The worst part is this is the second Winchester bootleg Amazon supports. How do you treat your artists like this. What's next, Amazon bootleg swap meat...pun intended"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS RIPOFF,"This is the WORST KIND of bootleg: Ripping off a gentle, trusting folk singer who needs the money. Why Amazon sells this is beyond me. This should be against the law, and I'm going to see what I can do about that."
1,this is a bootleg,"jesse winchester says on his website that this is an unauthorized album.that means illegal, with no royalties paid to the artist and no permission given.don't buy it.why is amazon even selling it?"
1,Software problems,"After spending many hours trying to get the software loaded using Windows XP with no luck I finally brought it back, for the second time. Don't waste your precious time messing with this SNAFU!!!"
4,Good easy to use camera.,"Pros: Fairly rugged, well built, easy to use, has a view finder as well as the screen, comes with a dock/charger station.Cons: Bulky, heavy, Slow, only 3x (optical) zoom, screen is smallI have had this camera since 2004 & have had no issues. It is a little bulky & is slow to start up and recover between. On the good side I have been happy with the picture quality, workmanship, and ease of use. I love that it still has a view finder. The menu system is straight forwad and easy to naviagte.I work in a shop that repairs computers, and we check in many cameras to send out for repair. The #1 issue we see is lens errors. Usually due to operator error, damage/abuse, dirt, or acidental powering when the lens is blocked from opening. I have never had an issue with any of these. The recessed lens assembly, as well as inteligent design which stops the lens if obstructed, has worked wekk to protect the lens assembly and mechanism.The dock is a great adition."
2,"Good Pictures, simple to use, DOES NOT LAST LONG!!!","I first got this camera for my wife for X-mas about 1yr 2mos ago. We were happy with MOST of the pictures this camera took. It served as our basic point and shoot camera on our trips. However about 3 weeks ago during a graduation attendance the camera lens would not extend, and displayed Error #E45 message on LCD screen. I checked with camera shops around my area (since it was out of KODAK warranty)It was going to cost me about as much as buying a new one to have the lens assembly replaced, due to KODAK parts being very expensive. I recommend to stay away from this model, or at least get extended warranty."
2,"BEWARE, CAMERA ONLY LASTED ME 14 MONTHS","DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER KODAK CAMERA !!!!!!!!!!!THE LS443 TOOK GOOD PICTURES, WAS EASY TO USE, AND I ENJOYED OWNING IT. THEN AFTER MY ""14 TH "" MONTH OF OWNERSHIP, THE LCD SCREEN QUIT WORKING AND THE CAMERA WOULD NOT TAKE ANY MORE PICTURES. NOT GOOD. KODAK ONLY AGREED TO FIX IT FOR $150 PLUS TAX AND SHIPPING. THERE WASN'T AN OPTION JUST TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AND ALL KODAK CAMERAS UNLESS YOU TAKE OUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE - 1 year life,i've just spent the last 30 min. reading other peoples reviews and am astonished that i am not the only one who has been experiencing problems with my kodak ls443 soon after its 1 year anniversary of purchase.i was taking pictures easily one minute- and NO the camera was NOT DROPPED OR MISTREATED- and the next minute the screen goes completely blank. i can still see the menu startup so i am thinking it is a software issue. tried to download the latest firmware and still the camera refuses to cooperate. kodak customer service is just intolerable.any advice on others who found a way around this- please contact me missvalones@hotmail.com
1,Good Pictures while it still works,"Bought one of these for my daughter (poor college student). The first one quit after two weeks - Lens wouldn't extend when you turned it on. And no, for the thousandth time, it wasn't dropped!Replaced by the place of purchase.Second one lasted about four months. Same problem. And no for the thousandth and one time, it wasn't dropped and no it didn't drink any water.Kodak support is absolutely horrible. ""Did you drop it?""...No...""Are you sure?""... Yes. ""Well if you send it in and WE think you dropped it we'll either charge you a zillion dollars to fix it or send it back broken for $35"".Current status is ""Arrived - awaiting availability of a technician to evaluate/repair"".Next time it's a Nikon 5700 or equivalent. It WAS dropped off a motorcycle at 60 MPH. Works fine and takes better pictures than the Kodak ever did.You get what you pay for unless it's a Kodak...."
2,SUGGESTION WORKED!,"A previous post a few pages in, I think in 2004, suggested gently pushing up on the lens housing while you turn on the unit. I tried this, at first on the outer ring (didn't work), and then on the inner ""cylinder"", this time it worked. I have turned it on and off several times now and it is working fine.This camera was given to me yesterday by a guy that had given up on it, he was cleaning out his cabinets. I will offer to give it back to him as it was an easy fix. But I will give this camera a 1 star rating due to the widespread problem that obviously mine has. Design flaws this bad should be taken care of by the company. (FREE SWAP/UPGRADE TO ANOTHER MODEL)""""""HELLO KODAK, FLAWED DESIGN - DO THE RIGHT THING"""""""
1,"After 12 months, #E45 message- somehow started working again","Similar to the other 50 people, my camera flashed the Error #E45 message after about 12 months of use. Being impatient, I tried turning the camera on and off a few times but nothing. I came back a few days later and gently pressed on the bottom of the extended lense as I turned the camera on, and somehow the camera started working again. Wouldn't recommend doing this if you still have the warranty, but if all hope is lost, give it a try."
5,Kodak LS443 Gives Clear Pictures/ Easy To Use,"The Kodak Easy Share LS443 digital camera is just what I was looking for. Four megapixel's give it a quality rivaling the best slr cameras and its point and shoot size make it a camera easy to carry and use anywhere. There is a movie mode, and you can take pictures in burst of three useful in sporting events etc. I've had the camera about two weeks now and I am really enjoying it. I take it with me all the time. It has oodles of features. The only drawback is the joystick/OK button. Its a little small for my big fingers but I am working with it well."
1,E45 Error,Got E45 error after two years. Had to trash it since repairing would cost more than a new camera. Piece of junk.
1,lens won't open,"I also had a problem with this camera. The camera is only two years old, but it will not work. I received the error E45 like many other people. This happened once before when luckily my camera was under warranty, but now it has happened again. I have never dropped or mistreated this camera in any way, but this keeps on happening. This camera is poorly made."
1,Easy to use BUT quits too soon!,"Do your homework before you spend $$$ on this camera. It is easy to use, and takes great pictures while it works. Average life span for this camera is less than 2 years. The longest anyone has had one in good use is 2 1/2 years. Way to much to spend for a ""disposable"" camera, that can't be fixed by the manufacturer."
1,Great Camera but doesn't last,"I loved this camera and found it very easy to use and took great pictures. However, I was very disappointed when it totally quit working one year and one month after I bought it. I elected not to spend the $150 to fix it."
1,please open,"I have purchased the LS443 like it alot, when it works. Am having alot of trouble getting the lense to open everytime i want to use it. No it wasn't dropped ever. no it hasn't been left out in the cold and No it didn't have water spilled on it. I haven't had the pleasure of getting a return call from kodak, The store i bought it at is giving me a hard time. I paid a pretty penny for this camera and really do expect it to work.I REALLY REALLY hate to throw away my money!!!!"
2,"I hate ""E45""... BUYERS BEWARE","Yet another ""E45"" victim.. I gave this camera 2 stars, only because it did serve me well for about 2 years, then about a month ago, if the lighting was not as bright as the sun, I would end up with pictures of a black screen. Then after not using it for a couple of days, I turned it on, the lens made wouldn't extend and it made a strange clicking noise like it was trying to come out, then it would stop and show the dreaded ""E45"" error message. I couldn't find my user's manual, so I typed E45 into a search field and to my amazement, came up with a lot of consumer review web pages & found out that apparently I am just one out of A LOT of people who have had the exact same problem! I don't understand why such a reputable company like Kodak would just ignore this problem & try to make us pay $150 or so, to fix a problem that is not the consumers fault. I am done with Kodak."
2,LS 443 Simplistic to use.,"Great instructions. Easy to use. Small size. Everything works perfectly - Zoom, Timer, Flash, review and delete. Except all the pictures are soft - nothing I could do to capture a sharp image. Used tripod and timer (to avoid movement) for senics, close ups and macros - all soft. Changed ISO to 400 to reduce apeture and increase depth of field - soft. I give up. Will contact Kodak."
1,do not purchase,1 year later the screen has blanked out and no longer takes pictures. Of course customer service offered to replace it with a new LS743 for $125. But why would I end up spending close to $525 (close to $400 for the orginal and another $125 for a new replacement) for a 4 MP camera. I'd stay away from kodak cameras and go with quality.
1,$300 to learn a lesson,"I bought the LS443 at Fry's for $300 about 2.5 years ago. It went dead last week in the middle of a shoot while vacationing in Mexico. The lens will not retract and the blue screen displays Error E45. Luckily I was able to download the pictures already taken but missed a bunch of photo opps towards the end of the trip. I consider the money spent on this camera the cost of learning, the lesson being ""buy only from well establised manufacturers with a proven track record in designing electronic equipment and even then, check reviews first for the model you want"" Will never buy a camera from Kodak again. My search for the next digital cam will start with Canon."
1,Error E-45 message- Another Victim,I experience the infamous E-45 error today. Kind of ironic that other customers have reported this within a 2 month period. HUMMM.... It is probably cheaper to buy a new camera than to send it out for repair.
1,Another Dissatisfied E45 Kodak Customer,I too just received the E45 message on my camera and have been told to send in for expensive repair. This camera was treated very well. I believe that camera when inserted into carrying case causes switch to turn on causing the gear damage. I believe carrying case is too tight. Would highly recommend buying from organization that will stand behind its products.
1,"Warrning, don't buy","It worked fine for the first two years, then i got the fatal Error E45 and now it'll take way too much money to send it off and get it fixed. the erro message just appeared, didn't drop it or anything. Camera worked fine till then. the processing time is slower and is a pain though."
2,Broke in a 1 1/2,"I really enjoyed this camera for the year and a half that it worked. One day it just started taking black pictures. I called Kodak and have had very poor support from their Customer Service. It took three calls to customer service, the first of which directed me to a web link which didn't work, the second of which I was transfered to a line that rang endlessly and the third to a support person who gave me the following options: 1) have the camerar repaired for $150+ tax + shipping (The camera has been discontinued so I am leary to do this) and 2) Trade it in for a refurbished camera (not a new camera) with less megapixels for $199 + tax + shipping. Any reasonable person who does the math can figure out I can buy a new camera for the prices I am being quoted. If I were you, I would seriously consider another vendor."
2,Short Camera Life,"I would have given the LS443 a 5 star rating for the year and a half it worked perfectly. I returned from a recent trip and successfully uploaded the pictures and recharged the camera with the camera dock. The next time I turned it on I got the error message ""Camera Error #E45."" I tried to get a repair authorization on Kodak's web site, but it finally indicated this camera is no longer supported. A $400+ camera not supported after 1 1/2 years? I also tried to telephone Kodak, but got a recorded message run around back to the web page.This seemed like a great camera, but became a lemon in less than two years. If it was an automobile, there would be a recall.I'll google check real carefully for reviews before I buy another Kodak camera."
1,Kodak doesn't give a damn about a bad product,My LS443 camera worked fairly well for about 1 1/2 years and then all of a sudden it would not take any pictures. Everything in the video display window was black - if you snapped a photo - it was also black. I contacted tech support and learned that they would take the LS443 back and for a mere $100 exchange it for a DX7440. Why in the world would I chance another Kodak camera. NEVER AGAIN!! This was not a great camera to begin with but to have a camera simply die that was not overused nor abused is simply unacceptable. Does Kodak care? Not a bit - there will be others who buy their product based on the reputation of the company. Well I hope this review informs you that that reputation is not so well-deserved.
5,It's Great!,"For all the things that this little camera can do the cost was really good. I would recommend it to EVERYONE I know. It charges fast and if you get a 256 MB card for it you can take about 700 pictures on it. Thats amazing! If you are looking for a nice little camera that can do lots of things, this one is for you. The software is really easy to use also."
5,great PC accessory,"I just replaced an old Sony 2 Megapixel camera with this Kodak. So easy to use! And with the 128MB card I get about 100 pictures in the highest grade photo. It connects to your PC for easy downloading, printing, automatic emailing.Fun camera. And this is a great sale price!!"
1,Good camera doesn't last,Good camera with two big problems.1: Its too easy for the 'On' button to get accidentally clicked on while in a bag or purse. The lens tries to come out but if its in a bag it can't and this may cause problems.2: My camera worked great for 15 months but now the shutter stopped working. Kodak wants $150 plus shipping to fix - not worth it.Many comments on websites about lens problems but no response from company.Brian
2,Reliability problems and hideous artifacts,"I have gone through two of these in one month. Basically, the camera just stopped working. The other problem I had was that the compression was very noticable at full resolution. What is the point of a 4MP camera when you need to resample it to a lower resolution to mask the compression artifacts?When it was working, the results were generally usable. I liked the picture quality of the Nikon Coolpix 3100 3MP so much more - the lure of 4MP for just a little more is just not worth getting this one."
1,Error # E45 after only 2 years,"Kodak should be ashamed of this E45 error.I bought this camera in May 2004 for more than $300. Everything went O.K. until July 2006, when it finally hit this E45 thing.Two years of service life is totally unacceptable. I have a Pentax 35mm film camera for 12 years, and it is still working without ever needing any repairs. I have a SONY 8mm Camcoder for 10 years without any problems.This is definitely a disappointing experience."
1,Buyer Beware - Kodak Lemon,"A $400 camera should last longer than 2 yrs. Same complaint as all the others. Tried turning the stupid thing on, listened to a clicking sound, and the lens would no longer extend. Contacted Kodak after reading reviews and of course they deny that there is any problem with the LS443 model. They will repair it for $35 or I can get the upgrade for $125. I think they should repair it for free. All of these complaints are unfortunately falling upon deaf ears at the Kodak company. I will never buy another Kodak product."
1,Avoid at any cost,"These cameras start out life ok- good, actually- But then the dark side comes out, and that is the horrible lens drive system. The gears go bad, and repair is only temporary, even by Kodak. I repair these products for a major service company, and the design is just plain bad. Don't think you can get a cheap one on ebay, either, to fix yours- They all have the same problems. Toss it and buy something else."
3,Lightweight but fun,The chattiness is fine. I haven't seen Collings on television but I can imagine how he'd be entertaining there. I wondered about his motives a few times when Collings' own paintings showed up deep in the background of photos -- obviously he's so deep in this world that he may have some agendas. But the overall impression is certainly friendly and the few artists he dismisses are big enough to take it. It's a fun book you can read in a couple of hours. The only problem then is remembering any of what's been said.
2,Needs to be updated.,"I bought this book back in 1999. It was a year before the infamous Saatchi exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum. I think this book gives too much praise and favoratism to the British artists featured inside. It doesn't give any information on their flaws, and you need to know the artists' flaws in order to understand their work.British art has been rising in prestige in the last decade, and this book should be updated for a new edition. It should also include American reactions to the Brooklyn Museum show in 2000, plus the changes in the artists' styles."
5,Corr!,Matthew Collings is extremely aware of the zeitgeist. His criticisms can be so accurate that it hurts. To get a broad overview on the phenomena of Brit Art I really can't reccommend it enough.
3,Range of Golden Hoofs,"Novels from the golden age of western fiction can either be great, or terrible. John Trace writes a good novel that examines exactly what it takes to carve out a living in a hostile land. Good range, gold, and water often attract the worst in most settlers. In the case of Dan Shea, gold is his fall, and a hold up, and soon a murder turns his struggle desperate.Written in 1941, Trace's style is more contemporary and holds up well. I recommend this read, but not the muddy cover Dorchester has put on this one.Tim Lasiuta"
3,Where is the Book?,"I found these cards to be excellent, but there is a big need for a book to accompany them. If anyone comes across one, or bless their hearts, decided to write one,these cards will be invaluable.I rated these cards only three stars because of the lack of information, had there been a book, I would have given them five stars."
4,my review,"This seems to be a sturdy useful addition to my pedometer, I have not yet used this product, as a similar item was included with the pedometer which was not quite as heavy, but adequate. I have been using the one which came with the pedometer."
1,You get what you pay for!!,Don't waste your money! I received this cheaply made strap in poor condition with frayed edges. I can't believe this was shipped to me in this condition. Not worth returning because postage would cost more than this is worth!!! Beware!!!!
1,Very Bad Product,"This ""safety"" leash for pedometers provides no safety at all. The clip fell apart in less than a week after I started to use it. Even when I tie the leash to a belt loop, it does not stay tied. Don't waste your money.Safety Leash for Pedometer (1) Unit. Helps Save Pedometers From Loss"
3,"It's Works, But...","The strap I originally had for my pedometer broke (because it was cheap and the clip was made of plastic) so I needed to buy a new one. I was hoping this one would last longer, but the the string at the other end of the strap broke after a few weeks. It's a good thing I bought two of them."
2,Pedometer safety leash,"I purchased this for my FitBit Ultra Activity Tracker. This product did not for me! Fortunately, this pedometer safety leash was less than $3. After just two weeks of use the thing fell apart; the stitching around the metal fastener, much like one you see on suspenders, came apart so that fastener clip came out, At $99, I would have been very upset if I had lost my FitBit Ultra activity tracker. Fortunately, I had another safety leash from an Omron pedometer; it has stepped up to the plate quite nicely and I have been using it since."
5,Nice Leash,"Just clipped it on to my pedometer and then to my waistband. Seems to work as promised, haven't lost my pedometer yet!"
5,Good product,"I have a pedometer, and the leash I had had a plastic clip on it. The clip broke. I looked all over for one, and finally came to Amazon where I found this one. When I looked at it, I thought that the clip was metal, which is what I wanted. I ordered 4 of them, and wish I had ordered a couple more. They are longer than the old one, and do the job just as well if not better. I would recommend them to anyone."
2,Safety Leash failure,The black tape that connects your pedometer to the little clasp came unstitched after about 2 hours of wear. Not good!
3,OK,"It's ok. My aunt had one so I bought one on her recommendation and I've yet to use mine. Oh well, at least it was cheap!"
1,safety leash for pedometer,I bought this because it was recommended with the pedometer I bought. You don't need it; the pedometer comes with one.
3,Cheaply Made,"I bought this safety leash for a fitbit. Most of the time it works fine, but the clamp is pretty cheaply made so if it gets pulled on too hard it can bend the metal and pop the pieces apart. That's easy enough to fix, but defeats the purpose of having it in the first place."
1,Product is Disappointing,"I received my pedometer safety leashes from BIGFLYSPORTS today. These items were delivered in a timely fashion.This being said, the leashes themselves are disappointing. It appears they will get the job done (i.e. hold onto my pedometer when it falls off), but they look terrible. The clasp looks like it came off of a pair of ol' school suspenders. Yes, it is as pictured, but they look worse in real life. But perhaps my biggest complaint is the leash has ""[...]"" plastered all along one side of them. If I wanted to advertise for them, perhaps they should pay me the few dollars I paid for these items.So in the end, I trust they will get the job done, but they will look terrible in doing so."
4,not bad,This is not going the change the world but it is much better than the leash that comes with the pedometer. If keeping it atttached to your hip (so that it doesn't fall to the ground) is your desire then by all means get this one or at least one like it to save the cost of replacement of the pedometer. All-in-all not a bad product that does the job. What more can you ask for?
2,Leash????,"If I could have kept track of it....It was smaller than a shoe string and I couldn't figure out how the loop was supposed to work. Maybe w/better ?? instructions??? It would work. Maybe I would have attached it immediately and would not have lost any more pedometers.??? Don't know. Lost the darn thing w/in hours of getting it. Had it attached or so I thought, but it didn't stay. Oops."
2,good idea but it broke,"I bought one and I recommended it to my sister. Hers broke within a week; mine broke within two months. I don't take it on/off often, so it surprised me when it broke. These leashes are a good idea...i use mine to secure my fitbit. They are reasonably inexpensive, so if you order them, get a few of them. They do break easily."
2,Bottom of the Barrel?,"This product is functional so far but appearance wise it is now at the ""wavery"" stage which I wouldn't have expected for a new product maybe after a few years of wear but not within a couple of weeks of regular use. What's up with this? I am already thinking of ways to improve the safety leash as it might not last much longer but what does one expect for a couple of bucks? Also I have found that at times the small loop slips out of the Fitbit or the clasp doesn't hold & have found the clasp being ""saved"" by the Fitbit or just dangling by itself. Live & learn. For a company that services heart monitors I expected more & would have paid more for a higher quality product."
5,safety leash is a product saver,Numerous people have noticed my safety leash and asked about it. losing Peds and other similar types of equipment is not only an aggravation but can cost lots of money (my lost equipment cost $100 and had to be replaced). Good purchase and cheap!
2,Disappointed - not what was expected,Not what I expected. I thought it would fit around neck and hol the pedometer. The description was not detailed enough.
4,"Works, Is cheap, but I just don't like it","I've used ths leash for about 6 months now, after the plastic clip on the original leash broke after only a few months of use. It works well, but it is clunky and ugly. My strap did not have writing on, but it is super long, made of cotton, and is now pilling and picking up fluff etc. I hate the look and feel of it. The metal clip is large and not as easy to attach as the original, though at least it hasn't broken yet. I really wish I could buy a replacement like the original, with a nylon strap and plastic clip. No matter where I search though, every result comes back with one of these... If anyone knows where to find something different, I'd be glad to know. Four stars for price and the fact that it actually does the job."
5,Leash for Pedometer,Arrived quickly and was new. I had gotten my neice a pedometer for her birthday. She likes how the leash keeps the pedometer from being lost.
2,don't know,lost it can't use it I don't have any idea where it went The clip on it does okay but it does slip off once in a while.
1,do not buy,Piece of crap. Broke the first day I got it and it came postage due. Do not buy this product.
1,It wasn't needed,"It turned out the pedometer (which I like!) already came with a safety strap. I didn't need it, and since it was mailed separately it ended up costing alot with postage."
4,Safety Leash for Pedometer,"It's not the most amazing thing ever, but I think it could save me from losing my Fitbit again when I clip it to my pocket. It's so inexpensive, why not?"
2,Unleashed,"I'm not sure why my husband bought this for me, but I guess he thought I would loose my Fitbit. I find this thing irritating and just another thing to think about. I'm using it so that I don't hurt my husband's feelings. It does work, however, to keep your Fitbit secure. I've never had a problem with that though."
4,Safety Leash for Pedometer,These are great for keeping your pedometer from falling off and losing it. I have bought these before and worn them until the clasp wore out. The only problem I have with this one is it is a little to long.
5,"Why won;t you ship these outside the USA, specifically to Australia","?Safety Leash for Pedometer (1) Unit. Helps Save Pedometers From LossI bought a triaxis pedometer a few months ago and it came with a safety leash but that leash only had a plastic clip. I wondered how long it would last at the time, and now I know. For the past month I have been unable to use the pedometer for want of an almost worthless clip. The metal clips on these should be far more sturdy, all pedometers should come with one of these to begin with instead of the cheap plastic things. I have tried to buy the same sort of safety leash in Australia, but cannot find them anywhere, online or shop front. That being the case I can't understand why you won't ship them outside the USA at least when coupled with some larger purchase, i.e. I tried to add to a few of these when purchasing the pedometer ansd I have tried several times since. What is the issue"
5,Great leash but had shipping problems,"I ordered this leash from BIGFLYSPORTS since they seemed to have the best Amazon seller reviews at the lowest price. I quickly got an email that the leash had shipped via USPS mail with no tracking number. After 10 days it had never arrived. I then contacted BIGFLYSPORTS, and to their credit, they immediately responded, and shipped a replacement leash, this time with tracking. I don't know if they ever shipped the first leash or if it was lost by USPS. The replacement leash did arrive quickly.The leash itself looks great. It is lightweight, and the clip seems pretty solid. Time will tell how it holds up."
5,Excellent customer service,I had problems with the product but the company was swift to reply and send a replacement. Nothing beats good customer service and standing behind your product.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the purchase. It certainly is not worth the price paid. The Omron pedometer purchased comes with its own leash which made this Safety Leash useless.
3,Have only tried two so far!,"The idea is good but, they can be annoying! I insert it in the earpiece port of IPad, it is both handy and annoying! Especially when holding the IPad in my hands....Wish it came with a clamp or something such that would be safe to use on IPad -- not scratching it!"
3,Safety leash for pedometer,"Item was as described with quick delivery. However, the clamp that attaches to the pedometer isn't strong enough to hold onto the pedometer. It kept popping off and dropping the pedometer. So, I bought a black string type shoelace, tied one end to the pedometer (thought its clamp) and made a big loop on the other end that was big enough to slide the pedometer through. Push that loop through a belt loop and then the pedometer through the shoelace loop. Haven't lost the pedometer yet. Simple and cheap solution."
2,Safety leash for pedometer,"I was hoping to find a leash that was exactly like the original that came on my pedometer. This one is functionally ok, but not what I would have preferred. First, the leash is unattractive (the old one was white; this is black) -- and it has large lettering all along the leash with the name (web address) of the maker, which is tacky. The clasp on the original was plastic and broke (the second one that did this). The clasp on this model is much more durable (metal); however, it does not operate well -- it frequently falls off (it does not adhere well). Fortunately, I have not lost my pedometer because of this ..... yet."
1,breaks,"Worked for about a week. Now it doesn't clip tight enough to ensure that I don't lose my pedometer. Luckily, I have another strap that has a different clipping mechanism, but I don't like how it attaches to the pedometer as well. Wish I could find one with a different clipping mechanism on Amazon."
1,Safety Leash for Pedometer,"I don't recommend this safety leash. It is cheaply made, and the clip fell apart on the second day. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Cheap product,"This is a very cheap product, so don't expect much. I guess you get what you pay for. You would do better by going to your local sports shop."
5,Safety Leash,Very good idea. It has prevented me from losing my pedometer twice and I've only had the leash a month.Diane
4,Indispensible for the Fitbit body monitor,"I bought this pedometer leash for my fitbit body monitor [...] because I knew the chances were great that I would lose the $[...] Fitbit. This leash is a bit large, but it works fine and seems totally secure. The latch is like from a child's mitten guard (the thing that holds a mitten to a child's winter jacket). Quite secure on any fabric.I own a Bodymedia GoWear Fit (I'm changing to the Fitbit if it is accurate enough), and I have already lost the GoWear Fit display twice since the latch system is so weak. I totally recommend this pedometer leash if you want peace of mind in not losing your expensive technical product that it's hooked to. I hook it to my bra and put the fitbit inside my bra, or hook it to my pocket or pants and put the fitbit inside my pocket or pants. A 4 star out of 5 since I wish it were smaller."
1,Do Not Even Bother,This product is not worth the money and it was very inexpensive. It is unwieldly and does not fit at all like the original hook. It hangs on the body wrong. sorry that i purchased it.
5,safety leash for pedometer,It's great. I almost lost my pedometer at the airport and the leash held it on
4,Worth buying.,"It is worth buying. Before I got it, I dropped my pedometer to the floor every day. One of my pedometers was broken because I dropped it to the floor repeatedly. This product will protect your pedometer. If the price is a little bit lower, I will give 5 stars to it."
3,Good for the price,"This leash was good for the price however, i Haven't really used it much. Brought because I lost my last Fitbit."
2,You get what you pay for,The clip is very basic. I've had mine for about a month and the clasp has bent so that it no longer stays closed.
5,I love this!,"What is it about Pedometers that make them leap off, into toilets, or quietly diving for soft ground so you don't notice they're missing till too late?I have several pedometers, but only one had a leash. And I wanted more.I've been using both the leash that came with the Omron (plastic locking clip) and this one (metal locking clip). Both have worked infallibly! And I cannot knock the price of this. I bought three, on the off-chance it might wear out. But in a month of daily, hard use, it's showing no sign of wear or failure.And it's saved my pedometer from the soup many, many times! The locking clip is sturdy. I've never managed to knock it loose from my waistband.(I did have to laugh about the ""action packaging"" however - the leashes came, loose, in a simple small manila envelope!)Thumbs up!"
1,What a waste,"This ""safety leash"" is a poorly designed total waste of money. The leash that comes free with the pedometer is much better and is perfectly adequate."
1,Fell apart,"Got the pedometer and the leash on the same day. The pedometer (Digi-Walker) works great, but the first time I tried to use the leash, it completely fell apart. The suspender-type clamp broke as soon as I opened it to clamp in on my slacks. It will cost more to ship it back than it did to buy it. JUNK"
1,The Confusing Leash,"Don't recommend getting this pedometer leash at all. As soon as I took it out of the box, it just fell apart. Better off with an elastic wristband if possible."
3,Spare Pedometer Leash,I bought a leash for the pedometer because a friend had one on her pedometer and said that it had saved her from losing her 'meter many times. I didn't realize that a leash came with the pedometer. The good news is that now I have a spare one just in case...
3,pedometer leash,"I bought this to use with my fitbit, but they don't really work together, since I wear my fitbit on my bra, and it doesn't need a leash. I'm now suing the leash for my ski pass, and it's fine for that. Not sure how it could be used with a fitbit."
2,safety leash,IT HAS A LOT OF STRAP AND IT IS NOT AS EASY TO CLOSE AS THE DIGIWALKER 200 THAT COMES WITH ITS STRAP ATTACHED TO IT.
2,why bother,"really did not need this and was surprised by how ""minimal"" it was but for the price what can you expect. If you really want something that will keep your pedometer in place just get one with one included."
3,Secondary Leash,This leash looks to be more secure than the OEM leash that is on the pedometer. Time will tell whether it works better. Package arrived Jan. 15 and it's estimated arrival date was Jan. 11 - 16. I had no communication with the seller.
1,"Not required, self-destructed","Amazon recommended this leash when I was buying my Omron HJ-112 pedometer. As it turns out, the pedometer comes with its own leash, so this accessory isn't even necessary. As an added insult, the clasp on this thing self-destructed, with metal parts flying, the first time I unbuckled it."
1,Shameful business,"The establishment selling this item sent it in an envelope WITHOUT postage stamp, so I had to pay the postage. If they cannot afford (or do not want to pay)the postage they have no business selling anything. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SITE."
2,Not too great.,"Okay, so this little ""leash"" has a metal clamp on one end which grabs onto the waistband of your pants. Fine. At the other end is a tiny loop of thread. No instructions provided. So I put the loop around my pedometer, under the part that attaches to my waistband (it's not a pocket model). Well, when my pedometer slipped off my waistband, the loop didn't even slow it down -- the pedometer landed on the floor. So I don't see how this leash is of any help, but maybe I just need instructions."
1,No show,"On April 13th I ordered a safety leash to accompany my purchase of a pedometer; both were to be part of a Mother's Day gift. The pedometer from Fit Solutions Inc arrived in a timely manner accompanied by a packing slip that indicated the safety leash from Heart Rate Monitors was also enclosed. No safety leash was enclosed. I called the company and was told one would be mailed out that very day - that was over two weeks ago. The leash was very inexpensive, but nonetheless, it was disappointing to not receive it and an inconvenience that I'll have to go elsewhere to get one. Poor customer service, Heart Rate Monitors! You received one star in my review only because I had to in order to get the review printed."
1,Stitching came loose after day 3,"As the title implies, the strap broke very early on and I don't own a sewing machine to fix it. I'll take it to a friend who can fix it in short order but that's not the way this is supposed to work."
2,It came postage due,"The safety leash is worth $2.39, but it cost that plus another $1.50 postage due. AND a trip to the post office, which opens after I leave for work and closes before I get home. It was definitely not worth the hassle.I received a metal clip, and it otherwise looks like the pictures."
3,safety leash for pedometer,safety leash is just that. it works. it was a little item i could not find in a store and was happy to find on amazon.
1,Don't Buy!!,The 1st one was broken when I received it. I called customer service and sent me another one right away. They were great and I didn't have to return the first. The second one does not give me the confidence that it won't break with use if the 1st one broke in the mail. The wire to hold on to your pedometer is so thin I would not trust it.
1,Slow boat from China,"I ordered a safety leash for my pedometer some five weeks ago. I can't write a review for this product, as I have yet to receive it!!!"
1,Mislead,"When purchasing the Omron Pedometer I was led to believe that I should purchase a Safety Leash while one actually comes with the Pedometer. Cost is minimal but shiping was four {4} times the cost of the Safety Leash. Needless to say, I'm not very happy with Amazon.com and the way they present some products."
3,A little too much,"The price was very reasonable and so was the postage but $2.39 total was not worth the cost. I thought it came with the pedometer I was buying and would be shipped with it. I have a problem with not reading closely enough, obviously. Works okay. The clip end is a little small for many waistbands."
2,Not pleased with purchase,It is made of inexpensive materials...cheap. It's not the kind of quality that I would have purchased if I would had held it in my hand.
2,Broke after one day,We several of these. The first one we tried out broke on day two. The thin string which holds it to the pedometer broke. We nearly lost the $25 pedometer. The second one is holding so far.
4,Cheap insurance for your pedometer,"I have lost 2 pedometers without this leash, the last one in the bay at Annapolis. It is an extra step to taking the pedometer off and on my clothes but it saved my new pedometer from loss/damage twice in just the first few weeks. Worth the minimal $$ and hassle."
3,Did not need it,"Well I bought a pedometer and the review for the pedometer says the pedometer needed a safety leash. So I bought the pedometer and the safety leash from Amazon together. It turns out this particular pedometer now comes with a safety leash of its own so I got extra. It was so cheap, (under $5 for two)it was not worth returning. It is very similar in design to the safety leash that came with the pedometer and there is nothing wrong with it."
2,Hm,"So, if you don't have safety lash, you can buy this, but when I bought my pedometer, it came with the one. The material of this leash is worse than mine."
3,pedometer leash,This item was ordered with two other items and the expectation was that they would all ship together.This was a 95 cent item but they charged $5.95 to ship it all by itself. The pedometers came with their own safety leash so I threw it away.
5,Does save you from losing your pedometer,If you try to carry a pedometer every day the danger of it falling out of a pocket or off of your belt clip are great. This little gadget has saved mine from meeting a bad fate (such as falling into water) many times. Protects your investment in the pedometer.
5,Fast Delivery,"I got this to attach to my pedometer. I didn't want to lose it, and this clips onto my clothing or belt. Great for anything that has a lanyard connection area.Safety Leash for Pedometer (1) Unit. Helps Save Pedometers From Loss and Misplacing and Not Lose Them While Running or Walking and Exercising"
2,Pedometer Leash,"It's okay. Was expecting something more but I do use it and on occasion, it has prevented me from losing my pedometer."
1,safety leash for pedometer,"don't know how to use it with the fitbit . in the picture it appeared it went around a persons neck , but it doesn't . the fitbit has no way of connecting to this product , so it is useless and wasted money ."
5,Excellent value,"When I first ordered to replace the broken plastic on my Omron Pedometer, I thought I didn't like the fact that is was so long, and also that the clip is bright and stands out in comparison to my old black plastic one. But, the length actually works well for reading the display and I just tuck the excess cord in my pocket. The metal clip is much more secure than the plastic one this replaced. So overall I really like it and the price was crazy cheap. Amazon service great as always."
1,It's Broken,"We opened the pedometer leash, and when he had the whole thing in his hand the metal clasp or the metal piece on the end just fell into pieces. He has made it work for him, the price wasn't worth it to send it back and go through the hassle."
3,Clip is only average,"I ordered this clip to replace the one that came with my pedometer. However, I am disappointed with the quality of the clip. It works but is only average in terms of quality."
3,Passable and worth the price,"Bought as a replacement for the pocket leash and alligator clamp that came with an Omron Walking Style Pedometer. When the pedometer is carried loose in a pocket it NEEDS the lanyard and clamp, or I found it will lose up to half the steps I take. Clamping it -- even on a leash -- keeps the pedometer in synch with your hip motion, and thus able to record every step.This leash came with two alligator clamps -- one plastic and one metal. I choose the plastic clamp, as it seemed closest in appearance to the Omron original. I have found that the replacement plastic clamp does NOT have the clamping bite -- the hold -- the original had. It works most of the time, but comes loose too much. (I can not speak for the metal clamp, since I discarded it when I installed the replacement lanyard.)Still, this replacement lanyard and clamp makes the pedometer count steps correctly and the price was right.Shipping was quick too!"
4,Okay but could be better,The metal alligator clip catches on some thinner fabrics. The original lanyard I received with my Omron pedometer had a plastic clip which was much better. I simply wore that one out. This one is okay but I would much prefer the plastic clip.
1,Useless after two weeks,"Very simple, the leash does exactly what it is suppose to do, keep my pedometer safe.Update: After two weeks of normal use, the clip now has a little gap in it and it will no longer grip tight enough to my clothing to keep my pedometer secure."
2,falls apart easily,stitching needs to be stronger that holds the clasp unraveled within a few days...had to sew it myself. It needs stronger thread also.
3,Hasn't failed me...yet.,"Seems to slip off pretty easily, but the clip is really good at staying on. I don't TOTALLY trust it, but it hasn't failed me yet, so that's good."
3,fits it purpose,I haven't really had a chance to use it but got it for the Fitbit I ordered for that just in case moment. From what I see it should work fine.
2,Purchased for Fitbit,"This leash works for Fitbit, but is not the most secure way to make sure your Fitbit stays with you. Fitbit, I think, needs to design one to go with their product."
4,A good idea,"It's a good idea to use one so that if your pedometer works itself loose, it won't drop or get lost.Safety Leash for Pedometer (1) Unit. Helps Save Pedometers From Loss"
1,"Safety Leash Not ""Safe""!","I liked the idea of a safety strap - that's why I ordered it. However, the plug-in to attach the strap to the pedometer was too large to fit and the thin cord broke with very low use within a week. Disappointment!DJG"
2,safety leash,thought i would use it but i don't. not worth the long cord dangling off my waist just for a tiny little fit bit
3,seems fine,"I haven't actually used it because my fitbit seems to hold on tight without it, but it came quickly and is as described."
1,Left wing dimwits,"If there has been anybody in the history of American politics who have benefited without effort on their part, it is Hillary clinton. Next in line will be Teresa Heinz.Looking forward to reading that one."
1,"More Radical, Viscious and Immature Left-Wing Jibber Jabber","Uninformed and generally ridiculous, this book is yet another screed from a far left extremist who is just angry and bitter about the if-it-feels-good-do-it-slick-Willie years being over.The story distorts the backgrounds and careers of some of the most intelligent and independent minded women in the United States-- people whom are more educated and more intelligent than the author of this ridiculous book.Why is the author so angry and bitter?
