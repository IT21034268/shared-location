5,The Best CD ever,"this is my favorite cd of all time. although my favorite band is nirvana, my favorite song and cd are both by soundgarden. 4th of july is the best song of all time. all of the other songs(with the exception of half and kickstand, which totaly sucked)are absolutely phenomonal. i love this cd. it is a must buy for grunge fans. i recommend it over any other cd."
3,Bulky beauty,"3 1/2Maybe not as obvious a contender for alternative album of the decade due to a lumbering length and a personalized sound that wasn't prone to pigeonholes, SU still does in fact stand as SG's zenith as an art-metal influence."
3,"Good, although a bit excessive","Soundgarden were one of the more interesting bands of the 90's; their frequent use of odd time signatures, and their unusual melodies and riffs gave them a very distinct sound that set them apart from their contemporaries. That said, Chris Cornell's hyper-abraisive vocals are definitely an acquired taste, and listening to them can become very fatiguing over an entire 70 minute CD. Worth owning, but probably best taken in small doses. YMMV depending on your tolerance for the vocals."
5,Wow,"The worst songs on Superunknown are still great songs. Limo Wreck, Fresh Tendrils, Let me Drown are awesome tunes and there are many better ones on Superunknown. Most people probably already know Spoonman, the Day I tried to live, and blackhole sun. You get your money's worth here."
5,Black Hole Sun,"This is one great rock CD. There is one song in particular that I really like. ""Black Hole Sun"" is raw and Chris Cornell's voice really gives the word passionate a new meaning. His composition of this song and his performance of it show a certain gritty innovation of combing a melodic edge with his raw delivery giving it an extra dimension that kind of hits you in a euphoric kind of way. Cornell's rugged yet emotionally charged performances are representative of the best that rock has to offer."
4,THE BEST ''seattle'' ALBUM EVER MADE???,"Well I dont know bout that(because there is also DEATH and BLACK metal from Seattle..N.M.E(early 80's!),INFESTER,DRAWN AND QUARTERED..etc) but the song's on here are top notch and DARK!! This CRUSHE's anything ''nirvana'' ever did, those limp wrist's!!Chris Cornell was a talented guy, both guitar and vokill's were awesome, his lyric's how ever are just HAUNTING on this album, let it be known Mr. Cornell is not a big fan of the KOSHER or new world order..he might even be GERMAN himself I am not sure!!''4TH OF JULY'' is the highlight by far and rather uneasy in it's dreadful feeling, all the rest are cool as well!!This is def a classic 90's album..well in the more general rock sense of course!!Hear this..''The fire is spreadingAnd no one wants to speak about itDown in the holeJesus tries to crack a smileBeneath another shovel load ''-4th of july!!(4th of JOO lie!!)"
3,Overrated...,"This is a pretty good but overplayed record (and overhyped by critics who probably thought Badmotorfinger was too loud & abrasive). There are some strong tracks (Day I Tried to Live and Like Suicide in particular), but forgettable stuff as well. Not even close to their best...- cRAIG"
3,"Decent CD, but not their best","Don't get me wrong. This is a good CD. I'd have give it 3 1/2 if I could. There are some excellent tracks on this disk such as My Wave and Spoonman. However, many of the other tracks are a bit unininspired. If you are already a fan of Soundgarden, it's definitely a worthwhile purchase, but Badmotorfinger is a much better overall album."
4,Padding the CD Collection,This CD fit my minimum-buy quota by having at least 3 songs I can listen to more than once.
4,Amazing Album.,"1991,1994 and 1997 were amazing years for music in the 1990's. This one released in 1994 was one of the year's strongest album and after you give it a listen you understand why. Great musicianship, fantastic songwriting and great production. Chris Conrell's vocals are amazing and his lyrics are also top notch.This album contains absolutely no filler and even though it was released 9 years ago it isn't dated at all. Very impressive Soundgarden."
3,A low period in an otherwise great band.,"The Band Klaatu was a short lived Canadian band from around the 1970's-80's. These two albums were rather unsuccessful especially when compared to their first two albums and their final album. After listening to both of them, I wasn't really left with any impression and overall found it forgettable. Perhaps after a second listen something will stand out more but for now I am left rather neutral. If you are a hardcore Klaatu fan it is a must have but if you are only curious about the band then I suggest you pick up 3.47 EST, Hope, or Magentalane."
5,A Solid Work,"Russell F. Weigley's ""History of the United States Army"" is a commendable work on the administrative and logistical history of the Army. If you're looking for a campaign history, complete with narratives of battles, strategy, and tactics, this is not it. Weigley wholly sidesteps this arena of the Army's history in favor of a narration of the administration of the body. Beginning in the early 17th Century with an explanation of the militia roots from which the Army can trace its history, the story progresses through the French and Indian War, the Revolution, and all other conflicts through the 1960's, when this book was written. Included is analysis of Army policy, military interactions with the civilian populace, supply and administration, and the evolution of the command structure. For readers seeking a non-combat history of the United States Army, this should more than amply satisfy their desires."
2,a well-padded magazine article in need of an editor,"I snatched this book up when I saw it; what an interesting topic: ""The Inner Life of Music and Mathematics."" But I was disappointed in the book. The author acknowledges that the book grew out of an essay he wrote for the Sunday (New York) Times; it still seems like a magazine article; only, to stretch it out to book length, the writing just kind of rambles, with little apparent discipline, efficiency, or signs of editing. It was probably a heck of an essay; unfortunately, it's not a heck of a book. I gained a few insights (none of which were original to the author), but overall it was a yawner. I think there's still a good book yet to be written on this topic."
3,Too much expectatives unrealized,"I read this book to learn more about the links of this two subjects: math and music. I only have read it onces. I think I have to read it again, because the book it self let me know more question that I have never ask me before, and let the biggest part of them unanswered. The old questions and the new ones.It is too good in math part along and in music part along; but can not link them.Paulo E. Rios (prios@telcel.net.ve or 73000.1527@compuserve.com"
5,Fictional Story based on Actuality of Early Ground Controlled Approach GCA Radar System,I actually worked on the production version of the Exp MPN-1 GCA radar system this book deals with. Very interesting read. I only just learned of the existence of this book. I have never read any of Arthur Clarkes other books as I am not too much into SciFi. I don't understand why someone who enjoyed his SciFi books would put down his attempt to illustrate his actual experience with a real life Science project. These early GCA radars saved many air crews lives. The production units consisted of a Operational Trailer towed by a 2.5 ton prime mover (Truck) which also carried the diesel generator to power the radar equipment. I understand from talking to early British GCA Radar Technicians that there was an experimental version installed in a fixed structure at Heathrow towards the end of WW2. Possibly this was where Clarke experience this early GCA system.
3,"Really neat book, bad proofreading","Glide Path is a historical novel, describing WW2 radar technology to help land aircraft. Sir Arthur was there, and it shows, both the historical atmosphere and the technology. It's a good read.This edition is seriously compromised by a bad OCR job and no apparent proofreading beyond a mechanized spell check. The novel itself is an easy 5 stars. As presented here it's three, at best."
4,Sweet and light read..............,"I picked this book after reading the reviews and and I'm so glad I did. Melody Seabright a young so called witch down on her luck,and Shane a delightful 4yr. old who become the best of friends. Logan,Shane's father is a producer for a TV show who hires Melody for a new cooking show and from there fun ensues. I highly recommend this fun light read,and wondering if the sequel will have these three characters as well. Read this book you will definately enjoy it. I also forgot to mention this takes place in Salem, one of the most magical places."
1,I did really want to like it,"I stumbled upon Annette Blair's blog and wanted to read this series, because as an author, she seemed engaging. If I liked her blog I'd like her books, right? Not so with this one. I was so flat and dragged out. It was somewhat adolescent, and you never really believe the characters. It felt like a fifties sit com. I did give Annette another try, and liked Naked Dragon better. But sadly, The Kitchen Witch is not worth the time."
2,The Kitchen Witch,The idea for the storyline was innovative but the execution was poor. The book was poorly written.
2,Is it Magic or an Illusion?,There was definitely `slight of hand'. I was in the mood for Witches and Magic - hoping for Bewitched meets Practical Magic so I entered the key word Witch and Kitchen Witch popped up and looked like it would fit the bill. Then Poof! The witch wasn't really a witch. There was no magic. It was just the tired story of a pretty woman who uses her beauty to get what she wants. She bewitched the men but not me. It was cute if you enjoy romantic fluff but that isn't my cup of tea.
1,I actually put it down...,"I just didn't enjoy it. I didn't feel for the characters at all (even with the introduction of the young, single parent boy)... and ended up donating the book before it was finished. The plot seemed to be nonexistent, the dialogue trying too hard to be suggestive.... and really... underwear flying around the office? Ugh."
3,a real witch tale?,"Based on all the good reviews here I purchased this book, and I'm sorry to say I didn't find it to be all that.It's a fairly cute tale of a ""bad boy"" making good and a ""flighty"" girl struggling to find happiness. I use their labels in "" "" because I didn't feel like the author ever really gave us reason to believe her labels- other than her word.My other disappointment is that we never actually find out (she herself never admits!) if she is indeed a witch. Or, perhaps if she merely has a good knowledge of the lore, of plants and meanings behind colors, etc... and for some reason this really bothered me. Oh, she pitches herself as ""the kitchen witch"" to land a TV show where she chants spells and such- but there is no real magic going on and I found that disappointing.Even with some elements being off (including some spelling and other errors) it was still a perky tale of love. Just OK though- I wouldn't strongly suggest it to anyone."
2,Has potential but...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed. I read the first 5 chapters before putting it down. All I can say is that there is too much sexual tension and not enough witchery. Maybe if I had read further it would have gotten better, but there was only so much desperate sexual attraction that I could take."
4,Delightful and Sassy Romp Through the Kitchen,"This book was a fun, light-hearted romantic romp. As to the Title, ""The Kitchen Witch"", I'll leave you to figure out whether stunning Melody Seabright is one or not.Ms. Seabright certainly bewitched me with her upbeat cheerfulness and loving heart. Melody only wants a job to prove she can take care of herself, and to show her Father, that he can be proud of her.Logan Kilgarvin only wants to prove to himself and his young son, Shane, that he can be a good Father and provider.The sky is alight with the sparks between these two when they meet. Exploding chickens aside, this book was a joy to read and I laughed myself silly.I look forward to reading the next in the series."
4,A cute story but not sexy enough for me.,I thought this book was very cute and I don't regret buying it but it wasn't what I was expecting. I really expected a little more romance. The story was nice and it was definitely funny but if your used to Christine Warren novels this doesn't compare. It's a nice story and a good way to pass the time but not one I would rush out to purchase. It's well written and everything jut not one of my favorites.
1,"Ok, if you're twelve or have never read a book before","This is a really terrible book. When Amazon recommended it to me I thought it was a crime book or a book about witchcraft - I like those. This is a terrible romance chicklit rubbish (I also like some of those but this is awful). It mainly focuses on the main characters ERECTIONS which are very frequent and describtions of his ""THICKNESS????"". The sex scenes are unbelievable (at least to those who have actually had sex) and the main characters are flat and empty (except for the kid, who at age four is surely a child wonder as he takes active part in adult life and conversations, am guessing the author never met a four year old). Also the characters are supposed to have ""baggage"" and a ""past"" but really their lives have been rather uneventful so you don't get what the fuss is about. AVOID - Please!Ps. I really wanted to like this - so against better judgement I read it through waiting for it to get better - it didn't!"
1,"Wretched, Not Wicked","This book has great cover art and terrific marketing behind it. And trust me, that's all it has.Here's the whole book: two very attractive people spend hundreds of pages ALMOST having sex. Can you guess the climax of the plot? It doesn't really matter, because you won't care by the time it rolls around.The writing is execrable. The barely-there plot is completely predictable. The characters are one-dimensional. Gigantic passages are devoted to explicit descriptions of the characters' sexual antics, but they're not even erotic.This book is being aggressively marketed, but I can't explain why. Please don't waste your money on it."
2,Great premise that never went anywhere,"I really wanted to like this book. The premise is great and the opening drew me in, but after that, it fell flat. Logan and Melody don't seem very well fleshed out and I never understand them. The writing is entertaining, but I never really cared about the characters and had to struggle to finish.Another thing I thought was odd - there is no witch or witchcraft in this book. Because of the title, I expected a fun story about a witch. But Melody just pretends, which was kind of like my impression of the entire book."
2,Cute but no magic,"I'm a sucker for a wacky, funfilled romance. This was close enough for government work - I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. But I cannot tell you how annoyed I was to find out that there is NO ACTUAL MAGIC in this book (a la Mary Janice Davidson). It's NOT a paranormal. No matter what the title and description insinuate, Melody is NOT a witch. She's just a girl who dresses like a witch as a gimmick for her cooking show because she lives in Salem (in fact, the misleading advertising is what dropped this from a 3 to a 2 when I had to choose). Other than that, it's cute and fast enough for a beach read, but the characters are a bit shallow and rather irritatingly un-self-aware, and the ending is a little trite. Not the worst book I've read by any stretch of the imagination, good enough that I'll probably give Blair another shot, but I can't recommend it without a lot of warning."
4,yummy romp through the not so supernatural,"I picked up this book thinking it had a little flair of supernatural. I was wrong but still wasn't dissapointed. It turned out to be a sweet and funny story about a woman taking advantage of her reputation as a witch, a very sweet little boy, and his dad who just now gets to be with his son.I liked the idea of the TV show and the sparks flying between our ""witch"" Melody and new father Logan. The intimate scenes are not sugarcoated with pretty words, but there aren't too many of them and they don't last long. So if that normally bothers you it doesn't play that large of a role here. I also found the other woman vying for Logan and the situations that came up with her pretty unbelievable...one minute something huge happens and then the consequences are not mentioned for many many days. I still would reccommend this story- just remember to suspend your disbelief during those scenes. This story is wonderful girly fluff and I have gone back for seconds."
5,A blessing!,"There has not been a song by Jamie, that I do not like. Some really uplift me, and others touch me so deeply I am moved to tears. I cannot wait for the new CD to come out in April."
5,No Turning Back,A book explaining the scientific evidence for evolution. It is an easy to understand book for the majority of folks.
2,O K,"This movie was O K i could have done better in selecting a movie, I mean Halle Berry has played in better movies, i really do not Recommend this movie"
5,love it!,"This is one of my favorite movies!! I looked everywhere for it in stores, no luck. Don't miss out..ORDER IT!!!"
1,Poor Acting,"This has to be one of Halle Berry's weakest acting roles. The movie as a whole is stereotypical and cliche, not funny in the least. The script is poorly written as well as the plot and content.This movie is not to be taken seriously or jokingly for that matter because it just wasn't funny. It iscompletely full of over the top unconvincing acting.What a disappointment, and an incredible waste of time, money and resources for those that produced the movie. Certainly a waster of my time watching it.The only positive I would imagine someone giving this movie 5 stars for is Halle Berry-her hardcore fans that will support any and everything she does just to see her face"
1,"That star is for these reviews, not the movie","I can't recommend this movie. But that's not the only reason I'm writing.Why is it that when people think a movie is garbage, its defenders think those people need to ""lighten up""? When ""Bring It On"" was released, a friend of mine was literally incensed that I thought it was junk. He said not every movie had to be ""The Godfather"" (just as someone here said they can't all be ""Casablanca""). But does that mean every movie that isn't ""The Godfather"" has to be garbage? I like average, feel-good movies a lot, but it happened that I didn't think ""Bring It On"" was one of them. Maybe those of us who don't like ""B.A.P.S."" are using reasonable standards and simply want to see a good movie and didn't think this was it."
5,Baps,I purchase this movie last month. The seller was 100% true. Excellent service and in was brand new in the wrapper.
4,"Predictable, yet uplifting","The one thing i especially liked about the movie was that in spite of the stereotypes the girls remained themselves. They didn't have to turn ""bougie"" to become good people. They were already great and they were always themselves. Their dreams, or personalities didn't change when they came into money."
4,"Different, but I liked it.","This book is really different from any I've read before. I think the author has a really creative mind and set about writing a book that captures every gay man's heart by using humor and by finding the word ""Homo"" in everyday objects. I never even realized the word could be associated with so many things and phrases. I look at the whole world in a different light now! His web site, www.mrsideas.com, shows off his creative talents too. Very stylish and lovely, his site showcases his book. You should see it just for the sheer pleasure of it. You also get to read a few pages of excerpts too. Thanks Mario Sibayan for a book I'll read over and over. Keep up the good work!"
3,For Panasonic FZ30,"I found the lens to be slow, by at least 2 stops. Rear thread is 52mm not 55mm as this is what the camera is. I found the lens could not be attached with filters between the camera and the telephoto. The reason is you can see a part of the barrel which brings me to my second point. The telephoto can only be used at FULL zoom as any less and the lens barrel starts to shade in.I was hoping to use most of the cameras zoom to reduce the total amount of zoom. With the panasonic FZ30 and FZ50 I have tried, this telephoto fixes at aprox. 1260mm. A tripod is a must, auto focus does not always work especially in lower light conditions. Quality of photo on my camera is fair with blue fringing. noticeable barrel shading at full zoom, no filters, 55-52 adapter used."
1,Big disappointment for highly touted book ...,"This book would only be useful if I were travelling to Spain. And even the 3 days I spent there, not a single word was mentioned of Bilbao, Valladolid, and the northern Atlantic cities. Very dissappointing. The book reserves all of about 30 pages on Portugal, none of which provide nearly as insightful as the Lonely Planet or Michelin guides. My advice, save your money and buy something else."
2,Not sure the author went to the same Spain that we did.,My wife and I just spent 9 days driving down the coast of Spain from Barcelona to Denia and then north of Barcelona to Cadaques. Very few of the chapters were pertinent to the towns we visted on our trip. The map we purchased lacked detail and could be obtained free from inside of another tour book we purchased from Amazon.
2,What happened to Valencia?,"This guidebook contains useful information for the places highlighted by the author. It's coverage of Spain, however, is limited to the author's specific itinerary. I would expect any guidebook that has ""Spain"" as it's title to at least provide cursory coverage of Valencia and the Costa Blanca region in eastern Spain. These areas are not even mentioned."
1,awful tv-worse customer support,had this tv for about a month when things started going wrong. 15 months later (4 of it in the shop) and the picture tube is dead. zenith refuses to do anything to help and are actually quite obnoxious about it. i bought an extended warranty from philips warranty service. it sounded good. it turned out to be a ripoff. after they couldn't fix it instead of replacing it they offered me .20 on the dollar for it. they are supposed to have a lemon policy that replaces your purchase but they have a loophole that gets around that. my advice is to stay away from both companies.
4,a very deep book,"i read this book for school, it was very deep and explanatory (is that a word) and helped a lot with studies of the holocaust. it was very well written."
2,Cheezy Western,"This is a cheezy western where beautiful prostitutes hunt down a cowboy for revenge. It's probably not worth buying on DVD. It's got a small amount of violence and brief nudity, while being mildly entertaining."
1,Nonsense,"This movie is so bad it is hard to know where to start. First, if you like four beautiful women in tight pants showing lots of cleavage, who, after shooting some bottles off a fence, become accomplished gunslingers and hit everything they shot at, whether they aim at it or not, and you don't mind a thin plot and dumb dialog, then this is the movie for you.If, however, you like something at least remotely close to the old west, has a plot and decent dialog, this movie is not for you. In one scene, the girls are taking target practice. The only problem is, they are standing in front of a road with automobile tire tracks visible. Sure not the old west I have spent some time researching.Watch it on TV when it comes, but save your money."
2,not a very good movie.,"This is definetly not a good movie, but it's not one of the worst i've seen either. But it's still not worth buying."
2,not my kind of movie,"Tim Allen is one of my favorite commedians but this flix is not what I thought it was, not funny"
3,REALLY?????,THE COMMENT BOX IS TO REVIEW THE SHIPPER AND CONDITION OF THE PRODUCT. NOT FOR OPINIONS ABOUT THE MOVIE!!!!
3,"Cute, Predictable, But Not That Funny","I expected more from Tim Allen. At least from the movies I've seen, he has put out some classic comedy. In this case, the movie has all the right stuff, but just doesn't come off that well.The cast was great with Sigorney Weaver and Jeanne Tripplehorn, but every step was predictable. I was not surprised once. I don't mind that at all, but at least there should have been funnier gags to go along with it. In this case, it was at best mildly amusing. It didn't really have an ""at worst,"" which in this case isn't really a compliment.I can say I've wasted time on far worse movies.If you are into very mild rom-coms, I'd recommend it. If you are expecting more, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Not the best,"Not the best movie. I feel like I wasted my time watching this movie. May have been better with better filming and directing but the filming is ""B"" rated. The second half was a little better than the first half of the movie but it was very poorly put together."
2,U've gotta be kidding,"damn, i respect that this is their first album and all that but...not a good one man. This is a 1,5 stars, I'll be nice and give them 2. I feel like this is all the same song, the beats are all alike. Well, that's all for this album."
4,nice view,I liked the fit of the briefs. They were soft and snug. The sling support is something that you have to get used to. I loved the way it lifted the boys and it makes a great view. Definitely fills out the jeans!! Great product!!
2,Eh... Not worth the money,I bought this item and the identical one without the sling. I tried the sling in every POSSIBLE position and it doesn't show my package much more than the regular ones do. The sling does spin and twist and it isnt worth 3 extra bucks. The regular ones without the sling are on here for 12 bucks. go for that and your wife or girlfriend will be happy.
2,S-VHS Problems,"I have tried two of these units from SAM's club. Both had the same strange quirk. Their S-VHS cable output only displays in perfect black and white crispness. I have tried everything to diagnose the problem (multiple known good SVHS cables, multiple TVS) but it always comes back to a player defect. If I used the regular RCA video cable, the video displays OK in proper color, but it's frusterating that two new out of the box devices had the same problem. I never got the opportunity to check the three cable composite video outputs. I won't try another one."
4,A good progressive-scan dvd for the money.,"Based on a positive review by the Dec. 2001 issue of ""Consumer Reports"" magazine, I purchased the Apex AD-800 from Circuit City, as it was the only recommenned progressive-scan DVD player that I could afford. I do not have a HDTV, however, I plan to buy one in the near future. DVD disc sound and picture, when hooked up to a typical television set, are excellent. I put a music CD disc in, and it also sounded great. It is a very good value for the money. The only problem I have had with it occured when I tried to play a DVD disc that I rented from a supermarket. It was just too scratched up for it to be played. According to ""Consumer Reports"", some DVD players can play damaged DVDs and damaged CDs. I suppose that also depends on how badly they are damaged. I would reommend the Apex AD-800 for those people who want a very good progressive-scan DVD player, and who don't have a lot of money to spend on it."
2,Trouble With SVCD Format,"This is a good unit but beware it has trouble playing variable bitrate SVCD's. If your SVCD bitrate drops below a certain level, the picture will freeze and the audio will emit a high pitched squeal. If SVCD playback is important to you get a different player, otherwise, you will be OK with the AD-800"
2,Know what you want!!!,"I purchased this DVD because of the NTSC/PAL feature. I thought that I would be able to play Europeans DVD. I was wrong. This player will play Europeans DVD with Region 1 encoding which is US and Canada. In brief, you will not be able to play foreign DVDs with this player. I quickly offered it as a gift to my sister and purchased one of those DVDs [....]Now, I can watch DVDs from all over the world. With my new DVD, I noticed that the APex wasn't all that good. Whenever you want to change an audio, language, subtitle option, the movie will stop. It is not instantaneous. Also, it has no rewind or forward. You can only jump from chapters to chapters. And finally, it is almost impossible to decipher what's written on the panel. The inscriptions are too small.Be careful! Know what you want."
1,Very Mediocre,"I got this as my first DVD player not knowing what the differences between the various products are. I figured that the cheapest would be just fine. That was one of the most naive things I've ever done! The sound is delayed from the movement so it looks as if the movies were dubbed! Also- it has a major overexposure. There are also many times when it skips on brand-new movies!!All in all, I would not reccomend this, even to non-enthusiasts."
5,First DVD Player purhase,"This is my first DVD player purchase and I am glad I bought the Apex AD-800! I have an older home theater system so I needed the DTS decoder in the DVD player. I haven't seen another DVD player at this low price, with all the features and DTS decoding. I have been using it for three months now and would buy another one if I needed it. I've recommended this one to my friends. My only complaint is that I don't like the layout of the buttons on the remote but, on the other hand, I have seen very few remotes that have a good layout."
5,What a Steal!,"I was skeptical at first but then I hooked this up to my HD Big screen and the picture was unreal! I was going to spend more but I thought I'd first give this a try, smart move!"
4,"Nice, nice, nice","I had my eyes on brand name DVD players but after read reviews on amazon.com I decided to get this one. Nothing disappointed me yet. I have lots of my home-made VCDs in PAL signal and it plays them all without any difficulties. Amazing how it plays a normal MP3 disk with a list of songs from different folders on the TV screen and you can turn it into a Karaoke session. Easy plug, load, and play, many kinds of connections to choose from with all the cables, although the manual is quite bad with very few details, this might be that you needn't to do much to operate the machine. I tested it with NTSC, PAL DVDs and VCDs, no problems at all, nice for money."
1,Simply didn't work,"Read most of the reviews and decided to take a chance with a low priced item. The progressive scan option simply didn't work. When turned on, the picture was split in 1/2 in separate parts of my HDTV, and in black and white only.The menu navigation was cumbersome and really hard to get used to. My suggestion is to go to APEX's home page, and download the manual before you buy this item. If you can easily understand the manual, (and you don't receive a defective unit) then you'll have no problems with this unit.The remote control was strange to say the least. The usual 'enter' button was not near the directional buttons, so when you scroll through the DVD menu or the DVD player menu you have to constantly look for the enter button located among 10 other similar sized buttons. It's a small thing, but it drove me insane."
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"Had this DVD and worked until red lines appeared on led screen. Took unit apart and noticed exploded power supply component. The unti still plays CD's but cannot get a DVD to play. Apex tech support is horrible, they want be to ship the unit back in the original box."
2,Does not play PAL formatted disks,"I bought this unit to play my PAL DVD disks along with NTSC disks. This unit is advertised as being able to play PAL-formatted disks. However, this is not true. It will only play NTSC region 1 disks. This was verified to me by APEX tech support."
1,Don't Buy this One!!,"Worked great until red lines apearred on led screen. Now it won't play DVDs or CDs. It just gives an error message that says ""disc damage please replace."" Plus, nothing shows up on the led screen anymore. DON'T BUY THIS PLAYER!!"
2,Progressive scan is very poor on this player.,"If you're thinking of buy this DVD player for the progressive scan, DON'T! I have a 57"" Toshiba HDTV and when you turn on the progressive mode on this dvd player, the picture gets worse, it's grainy, blurry, and dull. Interlaced mode looks better. Plus this player will sometimes burp, meaning sound/picture pauses or seems to skip a second or two, like it can't keep up.I thought I was planning for the future when I bought this player but I wished I saved my money for a better player later."
4,Apex AD-800 DVD Player,The ease of operation and the crisp picture and sound playback are the qualities which cause me to be very happy with this DVD Player. And.............I couldn't beat your price anywhere!!
1,like many others here...,"my husband received this as a gift about 4 months ago and it died this evening. No power, nothing working. Strange how they manage to make it work within their 90 day parts and labor window. Now? It would cost as much in shipping and labor as it will to buy the new Sony my husband is out buying as I type."
2,It broke 1 month after the warranty expired,"I used my dvd player about once a month. I've had it since april 2002, and last month, May 2003, it won't turn on anymore. But while it was working, it was a good machine. The picture was clear, but it seemed a little faded, and it wasn't my TV, cuz I have a brand new Mitsubishi HDTV. I was happy with the player until it broke. So not sure what to rate this thing. I still have a GE DVD player I bought from Amazon about 3 years ago, and that one still works fine. So I guess I wouldn't really recommend Apex to anyone anymore..."
1,Disposable Product,"Funny, my experience is comparable to the first review. It had red lines at first, then the digital readout stopped working altogether. Two weeks out of warranty (one year old), I tried cleaning it, but that didn't help at all. Two months out of warranty, it stopped working altogether. I probably played 30 or so DVD's on it altogether, if that.Just a suggestion: If you do decide to get one of these, buy an extended warranty so you can at least get it repaired."
5,Simply the best Earth Wind and Fire album!,"Powerlight is strong from the first to the last song.Focused,simple,soulful harmonies,funky.A great old school album at best in the catagory of R&B-BANDS.Speed of love has a hypnotic groove,and side by side getsyou cha-cha'ing out out the floor,back in the day style.This album along with Raise,and ""I am"" are my top three Earth Wind and Fire albums.This is because of the balance of beats, melody, and non complexity of instruments.The other albums are good,but they tend to take you on a tangient.If you want to sit down with an old school groove,and not have to get up and forward a bad song,or be distracted,this one is it."
2,Too many chefs in the salad,"There are just too many outside writers involved with this project..""Side by Side"" and ""Fall In Love With Me"" are the only songs that have any staying power..I think the band could have used a little more time off to regroup after ""Raise"""
5,One of their best,"Powerlight is one of their best albums ever. I would rate this on a par with Faces and Raise as being an album where each track is superbly produced and different from the other tracks. The 2 choruses on Heart to Heart are subtley different from each other and this point exemplifies the musical subtlties that are present across the album. Even after 16 years, I still get a lift from hearing the tracks. Miracles is so powerful, and Maurice's voice consistent and clear. Fall in Love With Me is so simply catchy and the chord changes during the intro are spine tingling. Unfortunately, they went downhill from here,but it would be nice to see this line up return to the studio again!"
3,Futuristic Funk!,"As might be indicated by the cover depiction of celestial bodies, this sounds like music one might hear on some future journey to another planet. POWERLIGHT is probably the first EWF album where electronics & synthesizers almost completely overpower the more traditional instruments --which was an all-too-common phenomenon around 1982. (Check out CHICAGO 16, released the same year, and you wonder if David Foster didn't learn production from Maurice White?) One thing that hadn't changed was the band's wonderful & inspiring songs (all but one co-written by Maurice). ""Fall In Love With Me"" & ""Side By Side"" were pulled as singles, and rightly so! This is actually far from my fave EWF album-- but their ""so-so"" is better than most other's ""best-ever"". (And hey, wouldn't ""Spread Your Love"" qualify as a disco tune-- if it had come out 5 years earlier?)"
3,To much Talk,I love the Yankees and this has some of the all time greatest Yankee players but it has too much talk and non baseball stuff for me. I would prefer more action.
2,Recorded Versions of many of their best hits,"Be aware the the item description is deceiving...This CD has only ten tracks, NOT twenty, and they are re-recorded versions by ""as many of the the original performers as possible"". The quality is not the worst in the world...the instruments and accompaniment are good...but some of the vocalists sound different - harmony not in sync on You've Got Your Troubles and Here it Comes Again...not the same as the original version(s)...you get what you pay for. The dedicated fan would be best served with the original versions, go with The Fortunes: The Singles."
4,Bit typical story but still the best!,"I believe the plot of A BROTHER""S KISS, sort of typicalHong Kong gangster movies very 80's theme..like brotherhood, drugs and violence..with very tragic tales however the directorSeth Zvi brought heart warming moments with great actors' performance...worth to see it anytime!"
1,"Depressing, slow moving.",I found this very depressing and was disappointed in it overall because of this. I saw it mainly to view Adrian Pasdar's performance and that was also very disappointing. He was only on screen for a few moments and he was the best thing about this film.
4,The best so far of The Party Line,"I saw this one at a different bookstore than I usually go to, and since I didn't have this one yet, I bought it, even though I am not a big fan of ""popularity"" and excluding girls who aren't ""cool"" this was actually a really great book. It had nothing to do with the popular crowd, it was about a girl who helps a new friend make other friends at her school. It was a more serious, but more gentle, story. Our same favourite characters as well as some new faces are present in this book, as well as the best Party Line book so far that I've read."
1,Amateur trash,"The performances by the classical musicians are excellent, but the ""trance"" tracks added to it are amateurish and completely ridiculous. A high school kid working in his garage with a little bit of talent could do much better.Avoid ""Trance Opera"" and check out these two really good CDs that mix opera and trance/techno to really good effect: 1. Flower Duet by Luminaire on the Glass Note label, and 2. Spente le Stelle by Emma Shapplin on the Radikal Records label."
1,just as awful as everyone says,"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money. This really is as bad and worse than everyone says. I love opera, love some good dance, this is neither. Very sad arias badly sung with then some god awful upbeat tune planted over them??? WHAAA??? Great idea, would be nice for someone to do it properly now.Just read other reviews, it's all true, run away...run FAR away....."
3,Disappointed,"I received my set of CD's today and have only listened to CD1 (I will be listening to the rest). I am disappointed with what I have heard so far, purely because there is almost only one rhythm that persists for each and every lovely piece that has been selected. I love new arrangements but I'm afraid, going by CD1 there is not much imagination or beauty of expression. A singer that had me listening to every note was Charlae Olaker. What a beautiful voice. She sings 'Scene et legende de la fille du paria' - my favourite piece so far. I look forward to hearing more of her. Amazon doesn't allow snippets as yet and I am now beginning to understand why. If you are already a fan of the A-Team I am sure you will love the set, otherwise I recommend you listen to a few cuts before purchasing."
5,Side sleeper with big shoulders,"I'll start by saying, I've only slept on this for one night. But wow, how comfortable for me. I have very wide shoulders, and am a side sleeper, so I need alot of support. Till now, I thought that meant two pillows. This thing barely made it into the pillow case it's so tall! Once I laid down for bed, I was out. I couldn't believe how comfortable I was, my head just laid right inline with my spine.My view may change in a few months when it will inevitably start to flatten, but at $17 it's hard to go wrong. Especially when I just paid $40 for another pillow that I can't use because it's too soft. I may buy a few more while they're cheap just in case it does start to collapse on me."
1,"Dull, artistic and pathetic horror","Lots of people like myself were attracted to this movie because of the box cover and the presence of Christopher Walken. If he is in it, it must be good right? Instead we are treated to what starts out as a depressing, confusing drama of two alcoholics and their son on their way to meet Grandma. From there we suddenly end up with the corpse of a druid witch in the basement who isn't dead and wants a soul.While the acting is decent and the sets and scenery intriguing, the plot gets silly and tiresome.Its barely scary and half way through you will start to wonder, ""where is this film going""? At the end you will realize the dvd box cover was more interesting."
2,Bah,"Just couldnt get into the movie, and I enjoy gothic tales. I did like the first song in the movie, but can find out who the band was. :("
2,Strange,"It was sort of interesting, maybe just because you can look at Alison Elliot during the movie. Christopher Walken is his usual psychotic self."
3,first song,putting people to sleep. though it started really nice. think it is lack of budget... but the style is good. can someone please mail me if they have any information about the soundtrack? it was lovely. my email address is mindmagick@hotmail.com
1,Ugh. Bad.,"Also known as Trance, I picked this one up because I saw a preview for it and the premise looked interesting-- family goes to Ireland to dry out (oh, yeah, like THAT would work) and stay with the crazy uncle (Christopher Walken, the only A-list actor in the film). The crazy uncle has the well-preserved body of a two-thousand-year-old druidess in the basement, and hey! she just happens to look like the wife. (You can see where this is going, I'm sure.) We've seen it a hundred times. And it was done better a hundred times. Perhaps the longest ninety-five minutes I've spent in front of a television so far this year. Avoid like the plague."
3,Likeable Horror Fare,"I enjoyed this film immensley, but felt let down by an ambiguous ending. Walken isn't onscreen for long, but the couple are extremely charismatic and likeable. The camerawork and interesting use of flashback were the best parts of the movie. Also, this was set in IRELAND not Scotland as the above indicates! The reason I don't give it 5 stars, is that the Druid ""witch""'s intentions are never really explained. What does she want? We are told at one point she wants the heroine's soul, but this isn't expanded upon. The film is nice to look at, and has startling imagery, but the plot is incomprehensible."
3,Nothing to really brag about,"Eternal is an OK horror film. The idea is that Nora and her Husband Jim, along with their son Jim, travel to Ireland to visit her ailing grandmother. While there she stays with her Uncle Bill (Christopher Walken) who seems to be as ecentric and insane as he described her Grandmother. FOund this 2000 year old druid witch mummy in the bog and seems to be trying to ressurect her. HE succeeds and he dies. From there the witch is trying to fuse with Nora and live her life out again for another 100 years or so. As it turns out however that Nora Grandmotehr is Good Witch and with Nora help slays the evil witch.This movie is only Ok and is a weekend rental. There is mild violence and gore, and really the R rating goes for the [f]word ... being said a few times, a slit throat, and a lot of drinking."
5,Hard to open in a hurry,"I had a severe allergic reaction to a medication combination, and I couldn't get the quick melt packet to open. My husband had to find the scissors to open them."
2,Tastes AWFUL and makes your mouth feel funny.,"Ugh, these are awful. They work for your allergies, but the taste is just indescribably disgusting. It also makes your tongue numb. I recommend sticking with the pills."
3,hard to string for baby,"I wanted to have my 18-month-old boy practice stringing beads. All the other bead sets were 2+. So I got these. The only problem is that they are hollow so in order to string them you have to get the ""needle"" through the first hole in the bead (not a problem) but if you don't have the needle lined up just right is gets stuck in the bead. The holes have a lip on the inside so if the needle goes in at an angle the tip catches between the side and the lip of the second hole then you've got to back up the needle, look through the bead, line up the head of the needle with the second hole and then push it through. This is very frustrating to an 18-month-old."
3,Hard to lace,"Since the beads are hollow inside, it is a little hard for young toddlers to lace them! But they are colorful and durable!"
2,Not easy to use,"As said in another review, these beads are very hard to play with as they are ""empty"". When you try to put the lace in, it is hard to find the other end of the bead. I returned them."
3,Here is why...,"Duel of Eagles is a remarkable book. It's approach to history is unique and exciting. However, Long drifts too much into irrelevant details which degrade the suspense in the book."
4,Read it and see for yourself why I gave it a 4 star rating,"To keep things short, this book went into some details of the so called ""heroes"" of Texas' fight for independance. It did a good job of giving graphic mental presentations of the battles that took place during the revolution. Pick up the book and read it for yourself, you could not be dissapointed in the presentation of Long's interpretation."
1,Duel of Eagles,"Giving this garbadge one star is being generous.It is silly, and a complete waste of time and money-revisionism at its worst! It dishonors the memory of the great men who fought and died at the Alamo. Just another book by a liberal who hates America"
3,Needs revising,The book is good and has some good projects. It needs serious updating on a fair portion of the book.
4,Intense movie!,I enjoyed this movie but one thing in the story bothered me. Maria Bello seemed too friendly with her carjacker. Otherwise it was good.
2,Went from good to goofy,"The movie started out pretty good and then towards the end it just got silly and farfetched to the point where we were laughing. The quality of acting also went the same way, started really good and then was a little less believable as time went on...maybe the actors even knew what they were acting out was silly material at that point."
3,Victim or Perpetrator--Pick Em',"This is a nice fantasy thriller with the banter between the carjacker and carjacked mom (Bello) soooo unbelievable---definitely not what you'd expect between a supposedly scared out of her mind victim and deadly criminal. It's almost as if they're long-time friends or maybe ex-lovers. Bello plays somewhat of a weak, apologetic dimwit---quite the opposite of her tough as nails Jane Timoney character on Prime Suspect. You keep waiting for Jane to show up and save the day, and when she finally does toward the end of the movie, the tables turn. The victim becomes the deadly perpetrator and the bad guy becomes the victim--and that, boys and girls, is where this movie really gets even more all fantasy and crazy."
2,AND THE OPERATOR SAYS 40 CENTS MORE FOR THE NEXT THREE MINUTES...,"Maria Bello stars as Lorraine, a divorced mother who has trouble coping with life. She is unable to take charge of her life and blames herself for every misfortune that comes her way. While spending her last dollar at a convenience store on pizza bagels for her and her son, she gets carjacked by Roy, (Stephen Dorff) a somewhat understanding, yet terrifying bank robber who gets along great with her son Chad, who BTW needs a father figure. The movie takes you to a point where it can go a number of different ways and downhill would not have been my first choice, but that is how it went.Good acting, although Mario Bello becomes less convincing as the plot turns unrealistic.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
1,Eh!,"Not that great other than seeing Scratch pinstripe. Ian is a different character in an artsy way and does not seem to build with practical knowledge. If we built stuff like he did and had it inspected for legal street use we would be denied the ability to drive it on public roads. He also destroys a very rare windshield which was kind of hard to see...but hey, it's art."
5,7th heaven the complete series.,Loved the whole series!! Very happy with my purchase! Loved the show when I was a little girl and am glad I can relive the show again and again.
3,Nice viewing,When life is not so good the Camden family always provides happy family tv. I want to be a Camden like every one else and I love to watch them deal with life's little dramas so nicely.It always makes me feel better.
4,7th Heaven,"Its a great buy all 11 seasons seperate. Good quality not a fake. Its a entertaining show makes me wish I had a big family or came from a big family. They all are so loving and caring But they do have their dramas community service, Married after 1 date, smoking pot and drinking and driving. Its good to see Ashley Simpson and Jeremy London and his twin.Enjoy"
3,Packaging,"I am giving this as a gift, and am disappointed that only the first two seasons are in there own box. The promotion link at Amazon shows each DVD in its own box."
5,7th. Heaven series,Once again the Kids put this on their Christmas list. They arrived in excellent condition and they have already enjoyed watching some of them.
4,wonderful!,"I love this curling iron! i have very thick wavy hair that never wants to do what i want it to! This curling iron gives me just the right lift and it tames my frizzy waves! PLus my hair slides so gently around it that it never snags and doesn't pull out any of my hair! It's wonderful. I would say my one and only complaint is that the cool touch tip isn't very big. I have 2 toddlers and often have to do my hair while they are running around and i have touched the iron instead of the cool tip on several occations, but as long as you are careful and pay attention to what you are doing this shouldn't be a problem with you."
3,curling iron,So far it seems pretty good. I actually like the ones that my hair slips easier on and I like the ones with just one heat setting. It is hard to keep the setting on one number as you turn it. Next time I would get the next size larger.
2,Bad design!,"If this was just designed a bit better it would be great. It heats quick and leaves hair smooth. I have long hair, so I need to hold the end while curling my hair. When I first started to use this curling iron, I burned my fingers numerous times. The end is way to short, plus it is rounded and not easy to hold on to. Another problem is where the control to turn on/off is located. The switch is located right where your pinky goes, and I usually end up turning it off once, during each use. This is frustrating when you don't realize you have done this, and the iron cools. Lastly, the hinge catches your hair and pulls it out. I would not recommend this item until they change the design, and I will make sure next time I purchase a curling iron, that I look more closely at the design, and read some reviews."
4,Good Product,"This is a great curling iron. It heats up well, allows you to set different heat settings, and holds the curl for a long time - which is something I have a really hard time getting my hair to do. My only complaint is that the section at the end of the iron is really small and I burn my fingers a lot when trying to hold on to both ends. Also, the clasp doesn't hold the hair very well so it sometimes takes a couple of tries to get my hair to stay in it, but once I do, then it works well. This iron is well worth the price."
4,Amazing curling iron!,"I can not believe how this curling iron easily curls my hair. Before I bought this curling iron I would use my hot tools curling iron. There is no comparison! I think the tourmaline and ceramic material reallys makes the big difference. My hair could never hold a curl. I used this curling iron with just a leave in conditioner and my hair stayed curly for the whole day. I also love the fact the hair easily slides of when you release the clamp which reveals a nice curl. I highly recommend this curling iron! And for the price you really are getting your money's worth. I bought mine at Wal-mart for just $19.88. I have the 1"" barrel which works best for my hair length which is a couple of inches below the shoulders. I did not give it 5 stars since the power button is in a place where you can easily switch it off. This does not bother me though since I am already amazed how I can finally curl my hair so easily and quick."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This curling iron is terrible, which is a shame because all the reviews are generally positive. It burns my hair and doesn't curl AT ALL. I've tried the different heat settings, smaller and bigger chunks of hair and leaving it in for awhile - it just does not work. I have straight fine hair and I have never experienced this problem with any curling iron in the past."
4,Satisfied,"Heats up quickly and curls my fine, straight, hard to curl hair. Cools off quickly. I really like the fact that the stand is not the spring kind. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the plastic tip on the end where you can hold is too small and I keep burning myself."
2,Didn't work,The curling iron leaves lines from the clamp and the curls do not even work much less hold in my hair. I even used a ton of hairspray
4,Love it,"I am on my second infiniti curling iron. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the spring snaps rather quickly. It broke on my first curling iron in about a year, so I got a new one. Yesterday I was doing my hair and it broke on the new curling iron. I went to the store last night and got a different curling iron, not a consort. Not happy with it, my hair kept snagging and it took a while to heat back up between curls. So today I scoured the internet trying to find out how to order a replacement spring. The consort website is not helpful but I finally found it somewhere else. I ordered 2 springs figuring it will probably happen again sometime. Other than that it is a great curling iron. Best I have had and I have thick hair that is really long. Doesn't burn my hair."
2,Crap Iron,"Does not heat up well and stay hot, nor holds my hair in the clip to the end, as I pull the hair down to curl at the ends, the clip is not tight to the barrel and slips out. Not happy with this item."
5,Works very well,Heats up quickly and functions very well. I am pleased with the purchase and would buy the same model again if this one fails in the future.
3,Heats Fast,This iron heats very fast & works well. My only complaint is that when you put it down the hot part tips forward which will burn whatever it's on. So I recommend keeping it on a something heatproof. Maybe a glass type plate or mirror.
1,curling iron,This curling iron is difficult to use for long hair. The tip is difficult to control while curling and gets very hot. It is small and so you often touch the iron. It is hard to control when curling and long hair tends to get caught and pulls.
1,Ouch!,"I have repeatedly burned my index finger with this curling iron. The black plastic end of the curling iron has a little safety rest so that the curling iron doesn't burn surface it is heated up on. However, the rest doesn't go all the around the circumfrance of the black plastic end of the curling iron so it is really easy to initially rest your index finger on the safety rest and when you go to turn the curling iron in an attempt to wind your hair around the barrel, your finger automatically moves from the safety rest to the PIPING HOT IRON!. I actually blistered my index finger the third time I used this curling iron! Choose a safer curling iron or suffer the burns!"
1,"Difficult to Use, Always Turns Off","This curling iron is such a hassle because the on/off switch as well as the temperature setting buttons are on the handle, and every time I roll my hair I end up turning the curling iron off. Every time! I am ready to throw it away because of this. The setting buttons need to be in a different place. Very frustrating!!!"
4,Infinity by Conair,"Consumer Reports ranks Infinity by Conair CD106 Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Curling Iron very highly, and I agree. It is easy to use, heats quickly, makes your hair shine, and has a cover to protect the iron during storage. The only disadvantage is the placement of the controls on the front of the handle, where they can be inadvertently shut off."
4,Great overall,"I've had it for a week now and I love it how light it is and how fast it heats up - comparing to a Revlon that I had before. The heat spreads evenly and it slides smoothly out of the curl. The only con I find it is that the buttons are too easy to press and I constantly turn it off as I am curling my hair just by accidentally touching the on/off button or change the temperature. Unfortunately the buttons are located where your thumb would usually get a grip so I wish it was a dial button instead of this easy to press one but besides that, great product!"
2,Design flaw & Frustrating to use,"This iron drives me crazy. It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of. It is nearly impossible to use this device without turning it off during styling. The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely. Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool. I simply do not like it. I have only had this model for a couple of weeks and will be ordering a FHI or CHI. You always get what you pay for."
1,Lasts a long time,"I've had this unit quite some time, but it is not one of my favorites. It does get really hot, and if you are not careful you can end up with burned smelling hair, though the hair itself does not appear damaged just smells bad. It will give some curl, but they don't last long at all."
1,no curls curling iron,"I've used various curling irons over the years from various brands and of varying widths. ALL have performed better than this model. I had no problem with the placement of the buttons, however I did have a problem with it not curling my hair at all! My hair is naturally completely straight and the most this curling iron did to my hair was make it lean a little to the side. Definitely returning this one."
1,Bad Buy,"There are more cons than pros with this curling iron.CONS* The tip of the curling iron is rounded, so that it is nearly impossible to get a grip on it while curing your hair.* Because of the badly designed tip, I have burnt myself three times, while only using it twice.* While in use, it will turn off because the on/off button is exactly where most women would place their fingers while curling their hair.* It is awkward to hold and manipulate because of its shape.PROS* If you don't mind a burnt scalp and fingers, and the fact that it will turn off several times as you bump the on/off switch while curling your hair, it will produce good curls."
3,Could be better .....,I previously had my Bed Head curling iron and I must admit that I liked it a lot more than this Infinity one. It kind of feels cheap and temperature control buttons always get on the way :( . The black point on top is not long enough so I have burned myself a couple of times already so you should be carefull. Other than all these minuses to the product it's not so bad to create curls. I actually like the end result a lot :). So if you don't mind the design of the product but care for the way your hair comes out more than definitely buy it !
5,Impressive,"I ordered this particular curling iron because I liked the price and the fact that it was tourmaline ceramic. When I opened the package I didn't have high hopes, the iron felt really light and I assumed it was cheap. I used it the morning and I was truly impressed! I had it set on the second to lowest setting and it still gave me beautiful curls quickly. What impressed me even more was that the curls were still there the next morning. My hair is almost waist length and does NOT hold a curl for long. I didn't even use any hair spray. This iron was meant to tie me over until I could get a nicer one for Christmas, but I'm going to stick with this one."
2,Too easy to turn off accidentally,"This curling iron is being returned. The number one reason is that the on/off switch's design and placement is awful. I turned it off several times without noticing right away. Another thing I didn't like is that there's no indicator for when it has reached the temperature. Also, the ""cool tip"" still gets a bit hot. And last but certainly not least, the CURLS DID NOT LAST!! I tried a few of the temperature settings and my curls were falling out before I was even done with all my hair!"
3,A bit inconveniently designed,"This curling iron seems to work fairly well, though I don't have much to compare it to. However, the on/off button is inconveniently located at a spot on the handle that's very easy to press by accident. I keep accidentally turning it off while using it."
2,"Even it an awesome iron, it broke after being used 10 times.","I loved this iron when it arrived. The price was right, it heated really fast, everything appealed about it. I used it less than two months, 10 times at most if that, and it quit heating on me. The light turns on, and that is about it. Now it is more than 30 days, I doubt I can return it. :("
5,Conair culing iron!! MUST HAVE,"i have had this curling iron for about 3 months now. ITS BEEN GREAT. its great at curling and straightening. It has heat setting which is also great and it takes less than 30 minutes to curl you hair, and this coming from a girl who has REALLY puffy hair. I never regretted buying this product for a minute, its amazing and is a MUST HAVE. I love my curling iron. :)"
4,Over all a good iron,"It feels cheap on the bottom half and handling is just so so, but it hold curls well late into the day (for me) and it doesn't catch my hair like some do. I bought it for it's shut off feature, which my hot tools that I love don't have."
4,Conair Infiniti Curling Iron,I've had this curling iron for almost a year now and havent had any problems with it. It heats up quick and styles hair nicely. My only complaint would be that when I hold the curling iron sometimes my finger with touch the off button and it will turn off. But maybe thats just the way I hold it. Other than that it's a great curling iron and an excellent price.
5,Infiniti Curling Iron,"This is one of the best curling irons I've ever had. Styling products don't build up and it just glides through my hair. It gets very hot so am using a lower heat setting but it doesn't burn my hair, which is very fine but thick, even on the higher settings. Love it!"
2,Not sure if it's working right,"I've been using this curling iron for about a week now and it's not really producing the curls I want. I own a really old Revlon curling iron I was hoping to replace, simply because it's old - but it curls very well. I also wanted the 1 1/2 barrel.My hair is very malleable, and I usually always get good curls that last the whole day. However, right after I curl my hair with this iron, the curls go away within 15-20 minutes, it's really bizarre. I don't use any styling products, and I usually don't need to to keep the curl. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I've used every heat setting and still, the curls don't stay! It's almost like I never curled my hair. Should I return it?"
4,"My new best ""curl"" friend.","The price was right. It arrived quickly. It has helped smooth away the frizzies even without using styling products. Overall I can get nice smooth curls. Before the only way to get really smooth hair was to use my Chi, but I couldn't get the curl with it. I'm a girl that likes some curl!"
5,An Amazing Buy,"I love this curling iron for many reasons. First, it has adjustable heat settings on an led screen. This makes this iron perfect for every hair type- fine, medium, coarse. Second, it makes my hair shiny, voluminous, and soft. Unlike most curling irons that leave your hair feeling dry and dull, this iron does the opposite. Lastly, the cost is amazing for such a wonderful iron! Why spend over $200 on another curling iron that does the same job when you can spend $25 on this one? Overall, I highly recommend this!Other notes...This iron comes with a very long swivel cord, making it perfect for home and professional use.It heats up within twenty seconds."
2,Terrible!,"This iron drives me crazy. It heats up rather quickly and has three heat settings but those are the only positive aspects I can think of. It is nearly impossible to use this device without turning it off during styling. The on/ off switch is super sensitive and placed right where your hand needs to go in order to hold the iron safely. Besides the poor design, the iron is not that effective as a styling tool. I simply do not like it. I have only had this model for a couple of weeks and will be ordering a FHI or CHI. You always get what you pay for."
2,Too hot,"This is a good curling iron except for the fact that the temperature is WAY TOO HOT even on the lowest setting. I would literally just have my hair in it for 2-3 seconds because any longer I felt was horrible for my hair. When I released my hair from the curling iron my hair felt like it was sizzling to the touch. When I used this for about a month, I realized my hair was getting so damaged. My hair felt like straw and I have never had that problem with another curling iron. Yes, it works well, doesn't snag hair, leaves hair smooth...but damages the heck out of it! This might only be good for those who have really hard to curl hair and need the super high temperatures."
3,curling iron,it works good. except that while your using it the buttons shut off because where you have to hold it and than you need to turn it back on.
2,Disappointed and Curless,I read all the reviews about this curling iron and it seemed like a great one to purchase. Mine seems to shut off too soon [it is a safety mechanism built in] and I have put it on the highest temperature and still not satisfied with the curl. It is possible I have a defective one since so many others found it a good item. Check the product again to see if anyone else had trouble with this iron.
2,not sure if it works!,"I bought this via Amazon while in China. I'm not sure if the voltage difference is causing the problem or it's a faulty product. I am using a converter to plug it in, but only the light comes on--no heat. It's been 3 months for me without a curling iron in China; looks like it will be 3 more!"
1,I Hate It!,"Conair styling tools are generally awful, so I'm not sure why I bought this to begin with...my bad. As others have mentioned, the iron is horribly designed, but I'd be completely willing to overlook that if it actually curled my hair and did not leave my head smelling like burnt hair for three days. I have really long hair that has been ""weathered"" by lots of blow drying, flat ironing and bleaching...I guess the Conair Infiniti Pro just wasn't up to the task."
3,good but dangerous.,"The curling iron does the job. My only recommendation is to be really careful when you are doing your hair, if the iron touch for a second your skin you are going to have an ugly burn."
2,Poor Design,"Curling iron curls very nicely but has two massive design flaws:1 - the location of the on/off switch is such that I kept turning it off while I was curling, but wouldn't realize until the iron was no longer hot.2- the tip is not designed in a way that prevents you from putting your fingers on the heated portion of the iron.Going back!"
4,Pretty good,"I was going to get one of those $90 curling irons like you see at the mall that make awesome curls that last all day but read great reviews on this one and decided to try it first. My last curling iron would not curl my hair at all, this one does. It is a good curling iron for making the ends of my hair flip up or curl under but I will get the more expensive one for more full curls....if my husband will let me..:)"
3,Nice bouncy curls,It heats up really well and it's super easy to use. My onl con is that it doesn't get hot enough but that's my own fault for not picking a hotter product.
3,Buttons don't lock,When curling my hair I keep pressing the off button and I don't see a way to lock the keys. ANd overall I have used better curling irons
1,Terrible Design,You can't get your hand near the tip without burning it and in the meantime your other hand keeps turning it off because of the control placement. What a waste of money.
3,Decent Curling Iron for the Price,"For the price this is a good curling iron. I've had it for 3 weeks though and I am currently looking to replace it.Pros:- Heats quickly- Remains consistently hot- Has a relatively high temperature so it works on hard to curl hairCons:- After using about 10 times, there is a noticeable difference in the spring. When I first received it, it held easily onto my hair, even in small sections. Now I have to take larger sections.- My hair tangles around the screw.- It's not a seamless transition from the iron to the top plastic piece. The hair that wraps towards the top gets stuck once out of every 3-4 times.This curling is by no means terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that curls their hair regularly."
3,It's all true... the pros and the cons,"The pros - heats up really fast; leaves tight, cute curlsThe cons - terrible design in every way. First, the tip is way too hot to hold, so I've had to use both hands on the handle to curl. Second, I pushed the on/off and heat control buttons while using this curling iron, no matter how hard I tried not to. They're just completely in the way.All in all, I'm keeping the iron because I think it's as good as it's going to get for the price... I can just deal with the cons."
2,Button drives me crazy,I am actually on Amazon right now looking for a replacement because I cannot stand the stupid button getting turned off constantly and having to turn it back on.
1,Useless!,"I would have given it a zero star if I could.- The unit keeps turnig off or changes the set temperature. The on/off and temperature buttons are so sensitive that with just a light touch the unit either turns off or changes the setting. Because of the locaion of the switches on the handle, it's impossible to avoid touching them. I accidentally turned off the power every time I curled a section of hair.- The end tip is too hot to hold. You could burn you fingers!I'm returning mine. I can't find a bettter way to hold this iron properly without turning off the unit and burning my fingers at the same time."
1,REALLY NOT HELPFUL,"The on/off and heat setting switches are far too easy to hit accidentally while you are using it so I found the iron got either too hot or turned off completely. I have naturally curly hair and only use irons like this when some strands haven't curled as much as the rest. This Item did not glide smoothly on my hair, did very little to make a pretty curl and actually straightened my hair when set to the highest heat setting."
5,A look at what it was like for the Jews.,"Gives a glimpse into what the Jews went thru as they were pushed out of country after country...gives a glimpse into what they were up against. A Sad, triumphant, horror story."
3,I AM DISAPPOINTED,"I PURCHASED THIS HOME THEATER SYSTEM ASSUMING IT WAS A SONY PRODUCT SO IT HAD TO BE GOOD BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDNT TURN OUT THE WAY I THOUGHT. ASSEMBLY TOOK LOT OF TIME WITH LOUSY INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL, WIRELESS SPEAKERS DIDNT WORK AFTER TRYING FOR HOURS AND HOURS SO I HAD TO CONNECT THEM BY WIRES, TAKES TOO LONG TO READ EACH DVD AND INSERTING DVD INTO IT IS ANOTHER PUZZLE."
4,Sony DAV-FX900W,"The installation process was fairly easy. The programming was a little more complex. There is a downside to this system in that there are several different ways to wire from the DVD player to the TV and so far I cannot find a solution that allows the TV sound to be ran through the unit. The only thing left to try is the digital optical cable. If that does not work, I will be very disappointed. The system however, performs admirably with the DVD's and that is enough to warrant keeping this system."
2,Ok starter system,"This is a great system out of the box and for those new to surround systems, but not for the advanced listener. This system is easy to install. That is all I can say about it. The listening effects are maddening. You are unable to control the treble or bass yourself and will have to rely on preset Sony programs and you will be left wanting more if you have more than a small living space. The sound strength is very weak, and yes, as previous posts stated, update the base as this system has none. More, the absolute worst part of this system is not only they length it takes to read a disk; you will have no idea if it you have selected a cd or dvd until it has finished reading the disk. Not worth my time. This is a great system for those who can not hook up a wired system; but for all others, save your money for something more meatier."
3,Dream System is ok but not fantastic,The Sony DAV-FX900W has excellent features. The sound is just average in terms of quality. I was hoping for a richer sound. I still recommend the system however.
3,Good all in One system,nice system but the wireless speaker is only one !and you can't use wired and wireless setting together.I need still wired 2 RL and RR speaker together when I use wireless mode.poor design.
2,Another example of SONY at war with its customers,"If you order a DVD from Europe and want to play it on this SONY unit, you will find that you have wasted your money. SONY is in bed with the distributors and blocks your playing the DVD. This s not a legal block; it's just SONY in collusion with the film folks to diminish the value of your film collection. So be aware.This is the same as SONY's decision to no longer support Cablecards in its TVs. This is so the cable companies can overcharge you for the scramble box which gives them much of their profit. The government mandated cablecards for the cable companies so the cable companies do support them but then the cable companies got collusive manufacturers like SONY to help the cable companies defeat what they couldn't defeat themselves.You will be better to work with a more customer friendly company. SONY is not a good choice."
4,Good surround sound system,"I like this system, the sounds are very clear and clean. No static what so every, even with the wireless rear speakers. My only complaint is I feel the subwoofer is a little under powered. Other than that I am very happy with my purchase and if I had to buy it over again I would."
3,Decent System / Wireless can cut in / out too easily,"The sound quality is excellent. Easily installation / set up.Looks sharp in almost any room. 5 Disc Changer is convenient.My only beef with this product is that the sensor cuts out too much when you walk past it. And since you are suppose to have the speakers set up where the the front speakers are on ones side of the room and the rear speakers on the other this happens often. This is not an issue if you are using it to watch movies since usually people stay seated but when using it to listen to music and entertaining this becomes an issue.I got this one a great deal, shortly after the price went up by a couple hundred. It was definitely worth it at the sale price. I would not buy it if I had to pay full price."
4,Perfect,I purchased this system for my husband for Christmas. Set up was a breeze. It is a user friendly system for the whole family. Sounds great and looks even better.
5,This is Great,"This is a great sounding system. It took about an hour to open the box, unpack it and assemble the speakers. The directions are adequate. Previous reviews I read complained about difficulty in assembling the speakers. It was easier than I thought it would be. Hookup was also easy. Calibration is also simple and fast. This system is plenty loud enough for my 14x22 family room. We hooked up the PS2 and Guitar Hero sounds amazing. I love it!!"
5,Sony DAV-FX900W,"I have been waiting for 6-9 months for prices to drop.They finally did. $499.00 at Amazon. I purchased mine at the Sony Outlet store. Assembly of the speakers took a little time but once completethe system filled my room with sound. I have 55"" WEGA HD Sony TV and COXDVR. I hooked up the DVR with optical audio to the Sony system.All worked very well and the sound is amazing. Try Saving private Ryanin surround sound. It is outstanding. I have tried DVD, HDTV, and CDs and all sounded great. One big surprise is SACD. This is a dying or dead technology and it is a shame. Try a SACD audio disk and the sound is absolutely incredible. All and all a great system. The loading of the DVD is slow. It has a 5 CD holder and they are stacked so like an elevator it has to go up and down as you change disks. This takes a little time but worth the wait. Surround sound adds so much to a HDTV. At $499.00 this is a great value. If you get this system a great place to buy SACDs is Amazon.com."
1,disappointed,Only a single cd-rw was shipped to me even though it is advertised as a 3 pck. They reshipped and again only a single cd-rw was shipped. Both have been sent back and I am watching my CC statement to make sure I have been refunded. I have no idea if the product is any good since I didn't get the chance to use it.
1,"1 star, for the cover only","The cover of this book was very intriguing, the contents sleep inducing. A really terrible book that I just couldn't get into. I skipped more than half the pages looking for the actual murder. I finally found it near the very end, when I was too disgusted to look any further. Don't bother with this one."
1,A cure for insomnia,"Got insomnia? Read this, it WILL put you to sleep. The book is very boring, all about drugs, art, and sado-masochism clubs. There are alot of characters to keep up with. The death of the boy, which you think the book will be about, doesn't come until the last few chapters of the book. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Couldn't even finish,"As an avid true crime reader, I usually finish books in a couple of days- but this book was so dull that I couldn't even get half-way through it before I tossed it aside. Don't waste your time on this one!"
3,Bag of Toys,I read this book and I think that it is very sad. I realize that Bernard LeGeros was not an innocent but he took the whole wrap for Andrew Crispo. Justice in this country holds little meaning any more.
2,does not include the nike missile program,"As the single largest peacetime program the army had from 1947-1974, one would think at least passing mention would be made of the ARADCOM program (Army Regional Air Defense Command) and the Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules anti aircraft missiles (Nike Hercules had 501 16-20 missile batteries located worldwide) As well as the canceled Sentinel and Safeguard ABM programs. But there is nary a word about any of them in this volume. To me (A Nike Vet)this makes this volume a very poor reference indeed, and a significantly incomplete book on the US Army. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star is it's beautiful presentation.(If you Love your freedom thank a vet, if you Love just being here thank a Nike/Cold War Vet)"
2,LOT TO SAY AND NONE REALLY GOOD,"THE PRINT IS SMALL FOR ONE, BUT THE LESSONS REALLY ARE POORLY DONE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE WHO IS TRYING TO LEARN ALGEBRA ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE OK FOR A REVIEW."
2,High School Algebra: Embracing a Complete Course for High Schools and Academies,"I was very surprised when I received this book that it was first published in 1892!! As such, it definitely is not written in the way textbooks are written today and is not, in my opinion, very explanatory of concepts or easy to follow. I should have checked the publishing date information before ordering the book, but I would not recommend it to anyone trying to learn algebra."
1,cheaply produced and incomplete,"I am a fan of both Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval and was excited about this video but, unfortunately, the video was simply a taping of a lecture they gave which contained nothing that hadn't been in their books and contained no good visuals. The production quality was not good either. It gave the impression of having been made in someone's garage. Worst of all though was the continual reference to some information about the Sphinx that would be given at the end of the lecture and that was missing in its entirety. The whole viewing experience was frustrating and aggravating and I'm annoyed that the disk cost as much as something professionally made. I think Mssrs. Hancock and Bauval should withdraw this video from the market. It is much below the level of quality of their books."
1,Disappointment,"This doc is very dissappointing. Instead of an (expected) animated, good quality, with many scenes from the ancient sites and nicely told story, this is purely JUST a lecture starring on dvd 1: Graham Hancock, and on DVD 2 Robert Bauval in their EARLY years. The lecture is also incomplete. It ends abrubtly. This low quality video was original on VHS and, by the looks of it, digitallised by an amature. Do not buy this dvd if you think you are buying something like ""the mystery of the sphinx"" or ""the great year"". Also there is nothing new here if you have read the books."
4,"Timeless Information, Old & Poor Production","This documentary has solid information, but is simply a DVD made of VHS content which was just lectures to begin with. I myself just rented this, and have no desire to own a copy of this rather condensed and incomplete presentation. It is worth watching however, but not for the purchase price."
5,An ocean of a tale!,"In Way Down Deep in the Deep Blue Sea, a little boy turns a simple bath into a deep sea adventure!Way down deepin the deep blue sea,there's a lot to find.I guarantee!Come on! Be brave!Just follow me!And let's explorethe deep blue sea!While searching for treasure for his mom, he plays peekaboo with a hermit crab, fences with a swordfish, and finally discovers a pirate's treasure chest. But look out! When a shark nears, he heads for the surface--his own bathtub where his mom awaits, and the animals float along quietly in the tub.This lively story is written in rhyme and the bright illustrations will delight any sea lover. But what I love most about this book is that it teaches children the importance of using your imagination."
5,A 1 year-old's Favorite Book,"Our first granddaughter loves the story and illustrations. I love the clever use of language and the surprise ending. It has been such a hit, I have purchased a second copy for our new granddaughter. It is a delightful book to read aloud and introduce young children to aquatic life. I highly recommend it and Jan Peck's other titles.Way Down Deep in the Deep Blue Sea"
3,Ok,The book is in good shape but I didn't know that it was an old library book so it had a plastic cover that was worn and a barcode. Wanted to give it as a gift but couldn't. Either I didn't read through the description all the way or they didn't say.
3,If you want better... pay more than 300 dollars for a DVD Camera,"If you are looking for a camera that records to DVDs and doesnt cost an arm and a leg, buy this one. It is a decent camera if you take into account the price. The quality isnt the best however its good enough for the average customer just wanting to shoot video of family events. If you are looking for top quality, pay more. It is true you get what you pay for. For me the camera is good enough for what I use it for... a once in a while camera moment.I've read over a couple of other reviews stating they are having a hard time getting their camera to read discs. I use the Sony mini DV-R discs and have never had a problem. They are a little more expensive however they are top quality and work great with this piece of equipment.Also I have transfered the mini-discs to larger ones using a panasonic dvd recorder using Sony (Large) DVD-R disc and havent had a problem either."
1,Horrible product,"I purchased this 6/15/07 with little time to shop, a day prior to departing for a Caribbean vacation. Just like previous reviewer, it has 'read' problems with the DVD's, every one I tried. Frequent errors, loss of data; 1 DVD rendered useless; problems ""finalizing"" the disc for viewing, etc. You can feel the DVD shaking and shimmying inside the camera as it tries to read it; sometimes it runs continuously trying to read, even when shut to OFF it keeps trying, running the battery down. Controls are poorly placed and hard to use. I plan on returning it to the store tomorrow. Don't waste your time and money!!"
1,Worst Camcorder,"Video quality is awesome. Thats about it. Every disc I have tried in it, I says error half way through and restarts. I loose everything. This has happened every time I have used it. Battery life, what battery life. I charged it for 12 hours, and I got 30 minutes of use."
2,"Nice camera, HORRIBLE battery life!","I bought this camera a little less than a month ago and thought I was satisfied. That is, until I charged the battery for the first time and realized that you only get about 20-25 minutes of battery life. What is the point of that? Then I thought, okay, well I will just buy a replacement battery, and cannot find one anywhere (I don't think they make one for this model). In any case, I shouldn't already have to look for a replacement battery. If I had it to do over, I would not buy this camera and do not recommend it at all."
1,Did not like this product.,"My husband gave this camera to me for my 29th birthday, just in time to record my sons baptism, which we had done at our church when he was only 8 days old. The film is completely black - you can hear the baptism but can't see it. This camera takes EXTREMELY poor videos - can not handle low lighting at all, which HELLO makes it useless to me."
1,crap,I've been disappointed with this camera from the very beginning. I've recorded 4 mini dvd's of important events in my newborns life only to learn that one of the four was actually to be made into a REAL dvd that I could ACTUALLY watch in MY dvd player NOT in the camera. Samsung you let me down. I cannot put my money into your product ever again. DO not by this camera if you want to record important things like your DAUGHTERS first birthday. I am so mad at you Samsung. Finalize this.
1,Terrible product and poor customer service!!,I was given this camcorder as a Christmas present when I gave birth to twin girls. I recorded on it and found it would not finalize and repeatedly received a disk error message. I tried again and got the same message. Now I have two unviewable disks with precious family memories on them. When I called customer support I got a woman who barely spoke English who went through several steps with me and then told me to only purchase Memorex RW disks. There should be a warning with the camera. Nowhere in the owners manual is a specific brand name disk mentioned. I did use a Sony disk once and it did finalize but am at a loss as to what to do with others. I am very unhappy with this product.
1,Never worked right,"The dvds it recorded never finalized correctly, lost a lot of good memories. Never focused well."
5,Great!,A legend and one of the most underrated Soul/Funk artists of all time delivered another classic album. The only problem that I have with this CD is remastering process. They (record label & mastering eng.) must do much better job on restoring such a great material.
3,A suacier worth considering,This pan immediately had two chip spots inside pan. Otherwise a great suacier. Hope to own more clad stainless cookware. My brother also uses stainless. Thanks Joshy.
4,Classy ankle bracelet,Ankle braclet arrived in a lovely jewelry box in less than a week after ordering. Very nice quality and I have not taken it off since receiving it. Has kept its nice silver shine too.
1,Waste of Money,"This game sucks. End of story. I should have wiped my ass with the money I spent on this game rather than purchasing the game. It does not deserve any good credit. Horrible graphics and stupid story to go along with the game. HOWEVER, shipping was great, came on time and didn't have a scratch on the game. Worth it to purchase from the company but not to purchase the actual game. Get another title instead from these guys. I liked the service but the game sucked. Haha anyway it's your choice, I'm not going to rant on and on about how this game sucks. Just take my word for it, go buy a real game instead of this one. Just remember the service was great, I had no problems with them, the game just sucks. But I am planning on purchasing from these guys again."
5,Uses for Oxygen Elements Max,"I use this procuct for removing tag warts, molds and to cauterize small wounds and promote faster healing. I also take a maintenance dose of 10 drops daily in whatever liquid I'm drinking at the time, be it ice tea, water, coffee, or juice.It gives a little more energy and keeps the body detoxed. If I need a laxative, I up the dose to about 25 drops for a couple of days. It gives me a feeling of well-being."
1,Snake Oil: no medical possibility of effect,"As a scientist, I can assure you that there is no biological basis for the claims the manufacturer makes about this product's effectiveness. Plain and simply, this is snake oil. While there may be some nutritional benefits (or perhaps not--see the possible carcinogen warning), it is simply not possible for the product to promote ""oxygenation"" of the blood. Any perceived effect is likely to be a placebo effect, and you are better off not wasting your money on this hoax."
2,I give this two stars because...,"I have not yet finished the bottle of this product. Thus far, I see little if no difference in the way in which it has made me feel. I was hoping for a little increase in energy with this product, but this has not been the case. When I mix the product with water, it makes the water taste funny. Not awful, but not pleasent either.If I do begin to notice a difference in this product I will write another email.Truthfully, Karen Romero"
5,best products,"received global health trax inc. order quickly. i have ordered from them before and in my opinion, they have superior products.i like the fact that some of the products, although for humans, can also be used for pets, mainly the oxygen plus.if you need to call the company, they are extremely helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant.i can't praise them enough.j. fleck"
1,no effect noticed,Followed directions. No results that I could notice. Could be that it might work for someone with different metabiolislm as we are all unique.
2,this did nothing for me and i had high hopes,"i was hoping for some health benefits and stuck with it for a while, but i didn't notice anything. several seemed to think it was a miracle, but not for me."
2,Not the greatest,"I ordered two boxes of Threelac (60 pack) plus GHT Oxygen Elements (1 oz.). I took 1 packet/day for 1 week and then 2 packets/day until completion. I added the max. dose of the GHT Oxygen Elements each time.I noticed no discernible difference in my health, although I have to admit that I have more issues I'm dealing with than just a high yeast count. Personally, I did not experience any issues with stomach cramps etc, as others have suggested and I would not consider my stomach to be among the stronger ones (perhaps beginning slowly with 1 pack the first week helped).Overall I cannot recommend nor discount the possible benefits of the two products, but regarding GHT Oxygen Elements specifically I highly doubt it has any real benefit at all - I would skip this addition."
3,OK PRODUCT,"I NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THIS PRODUCT, BUT I FOUND A PRODUCT I LIKE BETTER CALLED CELL FOOD. IT DOES MORE FOR YOU."
5,"Hanging File Folders, Assorted Colors",I am so happy with these folders. They are DEFINITELY colorful and are indeed brightly colored!! =) They seem to be sturdy and I love the tabs that come with them!
4,Just what I expected to get!,"And that, my well respected amazon reviewers, is a very good thing. No mishaps on this order. Size, colors, and ability to hang just as described. Sometimes the tried and true is all I want and that is what I got. As to the thinness of the folders themselves, perhaps these are slightly thinner than a previous batch I used, it is almost a non issue but since I compared both, side to side, must admit the ones before where just a bit thicker. Does that matter to the big scheme of things? In this case, no. 4 Stars for Smead Hanging File Folders, Letter Size, 1/5 Cut Tab, Assorted Colors, 25 Per Box (64059)."
1,Not wide enough,"On the product page it says this product is 13.3"" wide, which is exactly as wide as my filing cabinet. It turns out that is the width of the box not the width of the tabs on the folders which is only 12.5"" wide - so the product is useless to me. I'm not sure how I can be sure I am getting the right width folder if I cant trust the dimensions supplied."
5,TOP NOTCH,"I needed more folders and bought these on amazon because of the low price and free shipping. I probably would not have chosen colored folders, but whatever. High quality folders WITH inserting tabs (not all options come with the tabs so be careful). Very happy."
5,"Difference from ""64059"" product","It might be obvious to you, but (before ordering) it took me a few minutes to figure out what the difference is between this product and the ""64059"" variant.This one (the 64056 one) comes with 5 each of gray, maroon, navy, purple and teal. The 64059 variant comes with 5 each of brighter blue, green, orange, red and yellow colors. So if you want more than 5 different colors, get a pack of each! :-)"
4,"Great folders, but disappointed in the colors","Didn't get the colors I had expected on these. The picture and description lead me to believe that the ""bright"" more vibrant variety of the folders would be delivered - the lime green, bright pink, etc. Not so. The ones I received were the plain red, green, blue, yellow, and orange. It may seem picky, but when you base your filing on a specific set of colors, it's diappointing none the less.Still good quality folders, just not what I had expected."
2,Folders are good but the labeling is poor,The folders are decently built and seem to be sturdy enough. My one complaint is that the labels are just tossed in the package not as a sheet but piece-meal. You must hand-write every single label. They are not printer friendly in the slightest. I don't see how this is still acceptable after years of standard label sheets made for printers....
3,Good quality but not what I needed,The product detail does not specify the folders' dimensions. Too bad. I got it and it was too short. I have the A4 size file cabinets from Ikea and this one doesn't work. Other wise - it is what it is - a set of colored folders.
2,Embarrassing,"For a movie that's given 4 1/2 stars, Cocoon is unbelievably bad. For old folks? My wife and I are in our late 80's, and we had to force ourselves to a finish that was obvious from the first swim. There was perhaps enough plot for 30 minutes, but it was stretched to two hours. As for seeing the oldsters cavort? Ridiculous. Don't waste your precious time."
2,Snug sentimentality.,"Putative science fiction movie about the culture clash between aliens with vast reserves of motiveless benignity and senior-citizen Earthlings . . . it's really more grounded in the tradition of fairy tales, or, perhaps more apt, children's stories to be read before bedtime. Along the fairy tale line we have the overriding symbol of the Fountain of Youth (in this case, the Indoor Swimming Pool of Youth) which is supposed to indicate, roughly, a Be-Careful-You-May-Get-What-You-Wish-For moral. The movie is annoying, redeemed only by the charm of the old campaigners in the cast. It's not the fairy tale aspect that irritates so much as the cloying sentimentality that the tale is cocooned in. Director Ron Howard seems obviously influenced by his (apparent) idol, Steven Spielberg, that other great . . . ""populist entertainer"". (I was going to use another phrase.) Howard, Spielberg -- what's the difference? Same basic outlook; same basic movies."
1,This boring movie chewed up two hours of my life!,"I hate this movie so much the thought of it makes me want to cry. I tried to give it a chance, I waited and waited for something cool to happen. It finally did and it was called ENDING CREDITS. I wish aliens would come take away anyone who had anything to do with unleashing this movie on an unsuspecting public. This movie makes me want to commit suicide."
3,Cute movie but DVD skipped,"I saw this when it first came out many years ago and wanted to add this to my collection of favorite movies. It is a heartwarming ""human"" story; aliens and sci-fi are the backdrop. My only complaint is that the DVD skipped a few times, so the quality was not great."
5,Rescue of stranded aliens leads to charming comedy,"A group of aliens arrives in a Florida retirement community to rescue their colleagues who have been cocooned and settled beneath the sea. The aliens unzip and zip on their human costumes - the initial unveiling, witnessed by the boat captain, is beautiful and worthy of an award - and stash their rescued buddies in the compound's swimming pool. The retirees, after swimming in the pool, experience personal rejuvenation: they make love like teenage boys, eat like athletes, and Don Ameche's Olympian diving performance is memorable in itself. And then the retirees, now in on the secret, are asked to choose between attaining immortality by leaving with the aliens - or living our their lifespan on earth with their surviving loved ones.Wonderful, heartening and heartbreaking, inspiring film, directed by Ron Howard, and soooo beautifully cast."
4,I can't believe I'm the First,"I'm the first person to write a review of Cocoon! I thought it was a big hit. Oh well. It's very good. Great special effects. Very sentimental. The ending is too science fictiony though. If you really want good science fiction, rent Close Encounters."
3,An old favorite revisted,"O.K., Cocoon isn't among Hollywood's Top 100 All-Time Best Movies, but so what?It's good mind candy for an evening, tapping into even young viewers' desire to retain their vigor.It reminds me of either a movie or a TV program that featured well-past retirement men and women who sneak out to play in the moonlight and become rejuvenated, while their fearful companions stay in their rooms and wither away.I enjoyed Cocoon as a theatrical release, and I enjoy it at home. Let's pop up a bowlful of fun."
1,DVD Cocoon,The cover and the DVD were dirty. some brown black stick substance inside case and on the dvd. had to put on gloves and clean it. threw case away. have ordered from vendor previously without problem.
3,Thoughtful and gut wrenching drama,"Not all plays should be made into films as they existed on stage. This is one that happily was.The premise is a telling one that could apply to many other situations:What if you could tell whether your unborn child was going to be gay? Would you abort it?With actors as powerful as Faye Dunaway, Brendan Fraser, Garry Marshall, and others, this is not only a well made, wonderfully scripted film, but one that is powerfully acted.Because of its subject matter, films of this ouevre do not get wide theatrical release. It is for connisours of ""little"" films, like me, to realize their greatness and discover them on our own. (it's usually a 50/50 shot as to whether they're any good).Rent this film and see what you think. It's is a bit talky, but that's because they used the stage script for the film. It doesn't detract from the film, but because there isn't any gratuituous violence or neat CGI effects, you may find it a bit distracting at first."
4,Another Brendan Fraser *Must*,"Based on a play on which the premise that the 'gay' gene can be detected pre-birth, the film actually uplifts you to familiar family relationships territory - and Faye Dunaway is the Star in there. Tough decisions to be made (pro-choice/pro-life) feature, as well; and Rosie O'Donell beats Jennifer Beals to the finishing line. The Ultra-Ortodox(or is it merely Ortodox?, pardon me) in-laws of Jennifer Beals' charachter cannot take more than a minute, but they depict a whole gone world of pre-nazi Europe.The ending will come up to your gleeful expectations - but that's such a bonus nowadays you'll only cry yourself to sleep in joy! Watch it this season! Every season!"
4,Good Follow-Up,"I felt this was a really good follow-up to the Poet.hard to match fully because Bobby Womack knocked out the Poet.but Poet 2 is nice.cool duets with Patti Labelle who matches Bobby WOmack with Soulful takes on Songs such as ""Love has finally come at last""&""through the eyes of a child"".Bobby Womack brings the pain on ""Who's foolin' Who"".Why this Soul Legend isn't in the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame is a Great Mystery to me.but Bobby Womack is the truth."
3,Mixed feelings...,"I have mixed feelings about how to rate this book. The story is modern and applicable, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is basically a story about a woman who wants to be a painter, but after she gets married she discovers that her husband doesn't support her as much as he said he would. As they struggle through their marriage, they end up in reversed roles, with her as the ""man"" of the house and him being dependent on her.Unfortunately, the writing is often stilted and overblown and I found it hard to keep slogging through it at times. Three stars is a compromise for me. The story gets four, but the writing gets two."
4,It helps to know who you are,"As a leadership coach, I am constantly on the look for additional reference material and Tom's book proved to be a great resource. The Despard Performancy Type Test was an excellent starting point to help me understand myself a little better, but more importantly understand how I could be a better me.Tom's book is somewhat like a Reader's Digest version of many books - I appreciated his down-to-earth, common-sense approach to ""knowing how we work"".It's definitely a very needed book and one that I totally recommend."
5,A gold mine!,Tom Despard is a man with tremendous business experience and a knack for sharing important practical advice about business success with others. This book is a very helpful tool for understanding how to be your best at work. I don't know another one quite like it. I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it highly.Tom MorrisPhilosopher and Author...
4,Good if you are looking for a Spanish version too...,"I bought this tape because my toddler is bilingual and it is in Spanish too. So far she has watched it only a few times, but she is definitely more and more interested every time she sees it. It's great for teaching basic skills, such as counting and the alphabet..."
4,One of her favorites,My daughter loves Barney and this is one of her favorite DVDs. I personally don't care for it as much but she can't get enough of it. I wish they had done some more with letters and numbers but they have some fun shapes and color activities. The songs are catchy and my daughter always jumps along during the exercise portion and tries to sing along.
2,Not good,"Educational value: FairPresentation of the topic: PoorDraws attention of (my)kid: NoWorth the money?: NOEver since we bought this, we could play this only couple of times and now its taking eternal rest! Our child does not want to watch this any more."
1,"Dull, just like the authors","Dr. Drew has been making a career trying to pawn off healing advice to the general public. I wonder how he would analyze a doctor who is so full of himself that he thinks he can analyze someone on the phone within 2 minutes and give possible life altering advice.This book isn't intended to help anyone or enlighten you, it is just an attempt for the authors to cash in on 15 minutes of fame. There is nothing here useful, just 2 ego driven psuedo authors trying to make money. Avoid it, unless you have absolutely no self confidence and actually buy this mass media drivel like a mindless droid."
1,Reveals His Own Issues.,"Until Dr. Drew can deal with the fact that he has a profoundly unhealthy obsession with his radio co-host Adam Corolla, we will continue to get this kind of sublimated finger pointing.Dr. Drew often jokes of how he likes to use the urinal next to Adam or examine Adam's penis for disease. Perhaps it is a harmless schoolgirl crush, but it could be something far more insideous, after all Dr. Drew is hardly a schoolgirl. The observations in the book are obvious and Dr. Drew smartly lets Adam provide the serious medical advise. Still I am glad I have the book as it is rather funny and very useful as I read it to telemarketers when they call."
5,Dr. Drew and Adam Book,The Dr. Drew and Adam Book was hilarious and i learned a lot of information pertaining to the subjects within the cover. This book helps people from all walks of life with questions about sex and sexual related issues. Adam Carolla also spices up the book with his comedic lines. All in all i think this is a great book and should be read by all teenagers because it can help you with all the problems you face as a teenager.
4,Awesome Book,"I read this book almost front to back in a short period of time, and I really enjoyed it more than anything I used to enjoys Adam, and Drew's Radio personalities and it really plays out through out the book.I think I was like 17 when I read it, and I found out a lot of questions I would not have to ask later on in the future."
3,"Not as good, funny or informative as the radio show","I think their radio show is the best one I've ever heard and, though I learned a bit reading the book, it just didn't rock the way I thought it might have. You're not missing a lot if you don't get it. D+A: keep up the great work on the radio show, but try to make the book better next time!"
2,"Sexism, Generalizations...Corolla","I really love Loveline. It's entertaining. Sure, diagnosing anonymous callers in under two minutes is unethical and irresponsible, but it sure makes for a great listen. Anyway, I bought (and, sadly, read) this book because I was expecting a little deeper exploration of some of Drew's no-nonsense MDology and Adam's intoxicant fueled philosophies. I got none of that. What I got was a book that could've been assembled in a few hours. Brief rants from high atop the soapy box about how any woman who doesn't part her hair just so has been raped and raised by alcoholics, etc. and Adam isn't actually very funny. He has good timing, but a lot of what he says is just retarded. His jokes don't work on the page. Clearly Adam is looking for a father figure and wants Drew to embrace him and love him, which is why he gets so mad at callers...he just wants the attention focused on him, and his alcoholica. Don't buy this book."
3,the book is a good read but is a lot like the show,"the ""adam and drew book: a guide to life and love,"" is a fairly good read. Although it read very much like the radio show or TV show of Loveline. The book lurches and screeches like careening car out of control. In other words, it will go from one topic to the next within the chapters leaving its reader confused and disorented. The book also has its funny moments when Adam makes his crass remarks. And there are a lot of crass remarks from Adam. Dr. Drew Pinsky is very frank and often sounds like medical drone spitting out facts. He is very sterile about letting his emotions come through. This book is best read when it's borrowed from the next door neighbor or checked out from the public library. But if you have the money laying in the cravasses of your sofa waitng to be be spent, then buy this book."
4,"Very informative, but also entertaining.","I thought the book was very insightful. I especially liked the chapters on depression and suicide. I didn't agree with some of the things that were said, but it's nice to know different opinions on various topics. I hope they come out with more books in the future."
5,A great book with advice for anyone of any age!,"Dr. Drew and Adam really hit the spots that life go through most with this one. Dr. Drew is informative and gives wonderful, life leading advice while Adam Corolla adds an entertaining sense of humor, making the book a fun lesson in life."
1,Tired of being ripped off,"First Cracked, now this. I'm tired of paying good money and getting crap in return. I'm a recent fan of the Loveline show and wanted to get some more in-depth coverage of issues that Drew only touches on during the show. Sadly, neither this book nor Cracked provides that. I'd go so far as to say that we actually get less here than on their radio show. There's no excuse for this because while Loveline is free, these books cost good money, so readers expect a little more in return. I think it's depressing that a healer and good samaritan like Dr. Drew would produce crap like this book and the equally empty Cracked, in an attempt to rip off his devoted, trusting fans. I would like to return both these books to Amazon for a refund."
5,Jaw-dropping advance: my toddler prefers Word World over Diego,"My toddler was a Diego junkie, heaven help me. Luckily, we have no cable, so we could only watch on library DVDs or the few we bought ourselves. A friend turned us onto Word World, and my little one switched cold-turkey from a Diego-holic to Word World. We've bought several of them -- these are great to watch when you just need to make a phone call or whip together a recipe, and want to keep the baby busy.I like the voices, I like the characters, the songs are *not* like Dora's ""I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the MAP!"", the visuals are clever, and the stories are funny.Anyway, I am really strict about TV time, and Word World makes the grade. Thanks, PBS -- this is a surprise hit."
5,Love Word World!,"My 8 month old daughter loves this show! She claps and dances to the music and is just fascinated with it. We are collecting all of the characters right now for her - she loves to pull them apart and then stick them back together. They are great learning tools ... we use them to point out letters, the sounds they make, the sounds they make when they come together and then the word itself! A great association tool. I hope to have many more DVDs to come!"
5,So Very Helpful,"I purchased this book as I have recently come to realised that my husband, his mother and my youngest son have Aspergers Syndrome. For years I have been living with a man who's behaviors I found so very confusing. This book was easy to read and gave insites from partners of people with Aspergers. I was able to relate to the poems and experiences in the book and through this gain more confidence in myself and my own feelings. I discovered that I am not alone, that my experiences and emotions are legitimate, it gave me inner strength. I would recommed this book to anyone who like me, is wanting to find out more about how to live with Asperger's family members."
5,Beauty,"I bought this TV in July of 2001. I have had it ever since and it has been nothing but the best all around. I have been wanting to buy a big screen TV but keep putting if off because of this Sony Trinitron TV I have. So that's 9 years I have had this TV, I have moved 3 times since I have had this TV. No problems what so ever. The one bad thing is it is so HEAVY."
2,Broke after two and half years of use!,I bought this unit two and half years ago. Like it a lot until it crashed after only two and half years of moderate use. I had to pay 300 dollars to have it fixed. Not happy about that.
4,Seeing is believing,"While brousing about the store, the first look at sony KV 32FV 27was my seeing. Looking over the picture and reading all it's functions, was my believing."
5,A great Doctor Who book! It is a mystery of the Wirrrn.,The eighth doctor and Sam go to a wedding on Micawber's World. The year is 3999. What was to be a wedding ends up a disaster. It is a great book. There are many alien species in this book. I recommend this book to any science-fiction lovers.
5,Great book to have,"You can really learn alot from this book, Very Informative. I used it along with Astrology beginner classes I was taking...Great book to have no doubt."
3,"It's a workbook, not just a book.","I gave it 3 stars because the information was informative, but I had to purchase a birthing chart in order to get a 'good reading'. I ended up returning it. It wasn't for me."
5,A wonderful purchase!,"My Aunt is a professional Astrologer and has been studying Astrology for 30+ years, so when I showed interest in Astrology about a year ago, she immediately lent me this book. When she moved to California, taking this book with her, I knew I would buy it for myself and have not regretted it at all. I have found it incredibly helpful and I trust the information given to me mainly due to my Aunt's vast knowledge and trust in this book as well. I definitely enjoy the format of this book and highly recommend it to other Astrologers, beginning or advanced."
5,Great size,This is the piece I use most. It is perfect for scrambled eggs or cooking meat for one person.
3,Great power - bad design,"This blender has great power. It crushed the whole pitcher of ice in just a few seconds. However, for cleaning purposes, the measuring cup in the top is used to remove the blades from the bottom of the pitcher. We thought we had the blades put securely back in, and after a minute or so of blending, the pitcher started leaking because the blades had been knocked loose during the process. Other than that, it worked great."
1,DeLonghi blender,"This is a terribley designed piece of equipment.First, very difficult to clean the carafe. The base is difficult to remove and near impossible to replace without leakage.Secondly, the dual cutoff system is very poorly designed. More often than not, the blender would not function. If the lid to the carafe was not placed on the carafe just so, the blender would not operate. This became such a problem, that after less than 30 uses, this blender made it's way to the garbage.Although an attractive piece of kitchen equipment, it's deficiences made it entirely worthless."
4,AWESOME SHOW !!! AWESOME MUSIC,The OC always showcases great bands. And their mix cd is a lot of great music from wonderful bands. Keep up the good work
2,Not nearly as good as the 1st,"I bought this CD hoping for somting as brilliant or better then the first, but I only like a few of the songs, not even half as good as the first. Although theres a fair few people on here saying that if you like first you'll like this, I have to strongly disagree. Big disapointment for me, being OC/music fan."
2,Hollow earth theory? Interesting...Hollow earth dvd? Eh...,"As a listener to C2C, I was excited about this dvd. However, the fuzzy and cheap looking images were a big disappointment. This dvd could definitely have been done better, but the information was interesting. I had already heard it all before, so there was nothing new to me, but if you don't have a lot of knowledge of the subject already, you might enjoy this dvd. Personally, I think I could spent my money better elsewhere."
5,Worth the effort,"I love this book -- it was recommended to me by a friend but was kind of hard to find. Excellent delivery time, in the exact condition the vendor promised."
3,Photography writer leaders,"Not what I expected from Hicks & Schultz. I have been purchasing alot of travel photo books lately due to my decided direction with my photography. This book is way less value than I expected. Lacks direction, many other book available here that are way better value and offer alot more. Tends to tell the reader what he already knows. Not up to there usual standards...Maybe of interest to the novice..any higher than that...forget it.. Dissapointing!!"
2,Dated material,"While a lot of the content of this book was good information, the majority was quite dated. This could be an excellent book if they where to bring it up to date with the digital photography world."
4,Deepens the experience,"Giles' analysis of Selby's major works offers deep insights into these powerful pieces of literature. He delves into the psychological state of Selby's characters, common themes that run through all the works, allusions to influential literature, and Selby's evolution as a writer and person. His treatments ofLast Exit to Brooklyn (Bloomsbury Classic Reads)andRequiem for a Dream: A Novelare especially illuminating.Giles' observations are clearly expressed and most importantly, he isn't trying to convince you of HIS profundity, which is so common of authors writing this sort of thing. He's focused on the texts and explaining what they mean and how the various elements of the story relate to Selby's overall vision.My one complaint with Giles' work is that it's short. It's 164 very small pages that you will get through in 1 or 2 reading sessions. That said, the analysis will likely make you re-read Selby's works and deepen your experience of them."
4,Good Quality and Arrived as Described,"needed this book for a college course. it was a former library book, so it had some wear. Overall it was exactly what I expected and in pretty good condition, It also arrived really fast! only two days after I ordered it online!"
4,NICE SO FAR!,"I started using this product a few weeks ago. Although the instructions say to use it 3-4 times a week, I wanted to start off using it 2 -3 times a week to see how my skin reacts to it. So far, I love it! I really love the tingly feel of my skin after I rinse it off and how smooth and soft my skin feels. I have oily skin and by mid-morning, my face still looks and feels so incredibly oily! I will gradually increase how much I use to see how much it controls the oil."
1,I regret buying this,"Bad sound, uninspired, and amateur production. Avoid. It was painful to watch. I put the dvd up for sale right after watching it."
1,Garbage,"Do not buy this video! The man is incapable of explaining anything! How is he supposed to teach you how to build a groove if he cant even explain what he is doing. The sad and most hilarious part of the video is that he clearly knows that! Lol! If anything you can watch the video to view that! His body language is priceless and tells everything. Lol. Even worse, none of his improvisations actually groove with the track! They'll all garbage to say the least!"
5,Excellent choice,"It is a very good, excellent price with bundled software, the mouse precision is optimal.Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 - Mouse - optical - 4 button(s) - wired - PS/2, USB - silver - OEM (pack of 3 )"
2,Shiver,"This is a pretty good A-side song, I would recommend getting the single for all Coldplay fans who like to have the B-sides that you can only get on the singles."
3,Excellent single,"This is a decent single. What I love about Coldplay is that most of the time they put out really good b-sides; good, original, unreleased songs, not just some live track or dance remix. I wish the singles market here in the States was as large as it is over in England cause I feel we're really missing out on some great stuff. Anyway....""Shiver"" was never really my favorite of Coldplay's songs. It's not bad, it's just not as good as most of their others. Track 2, ""For You"" is not bad, it's a slow piano based number that moves along gently yet never quite achieves lift-off. The closing song, ""Careful Where You Stand"" is a great one however. It has a beautiful melody and a wonderful guitar part. It's definitely better than some of the tracks off of Parachutes.A decent single, worth the five dollars you can get it for."
5,Aloe soap,Good for washing 80 times or more a day! Long lasting and convenient dispensing. Lower cost than most other antibacterial soaps.
1,Unhappy with product,"The product received is not the product I ordered. It has no D-rings, no zippered outside pocket, no strap, and does not have dual zippers, as the description indicated. It is cheaper material than the previous version. I will not be ordering any more of these."
5,"Sturdy, Great Sheath, Chinese made","One side of the blade says:SWHRT7TCHINAThe other side:Smith & WessonH.R.T.Full tang, handle is some sort of rubber - has a great pattern on it that helps the grip - although the handle is pretty thin to get a great grip. The sheath is leather and is great, it looks great and holds the knife in very well. The knife (and probably the sheath) is made in China and it says China on the blade - which was disappointing as it generally does not indicate great quality in the knife world, (at least not as much as the words ""USA"" ""Germany"" ""Japan"" ""Sweden"" etc, although this may be changing.)We threw this knife at a tree pretty hard, maybe 20 times, very minor damage to the rubber handle and the blade is fine. The handle is still sturdy, overall the knife feels solid."
3,Bad sheath,"I bought this knife three months ago. From the outset I was a bit disappointed with the sheath, because although it is advertised as a boot knife, the sheath is much to large to fit comfortably or effectively in my boot. So, I clipped it inside my jeans at the waist, so it would be concealed (not the most comfortable position, but it worked alright). Then when I was putting up the knife today, I noticed that the knife's tip had poked through the sheath, which in a half decent leather sheath should never happen. My home made cardboard-and-duct tape sheaths work better. Although the knife is great, and is very affordable, the sheath is terrible, and I would recommend that you factor the price of a new sheath into the price."
4,Chris,"Great blade for the price. It took about 20 minutes to get an edge to my standards. The handle is far from comfortable, but nothing that couldn't be taken care of with trusty 550 cord."
2,Disappointing!!!,"With the Smith & Wesson name attached, I somehow expected something... more. It does have a thick heavy blade, but it has a second rate cheesy appearance. The edge looks like it was set with the coarse stone on a bench grinder. It would have taken more than a few licks on a whet stone to straighten it out. The handle was definately a non-slip grip, though short for those with bigger hands. The sheath was the best part of the deal. I resold the knife and bought one with better finish and workmanship."
3,"uh, this book was like ok or something","This book was pretty cool, especially the part when Butthead flushes himself down the toilet. But it needs more pictures of naked chicks."
4,"Great DVD but won't play on a Toshiba, and they don't care","If you can get this DVD to play on your DVD player, it's worth it! I bought two copies from amazon, neither which would play. (They were OUTSTANDING about trying to replace it and make it right.) Amazon was great, but if you've got a Toshiba player, it won't play. And Toshiba doesn't care. They say ""read the fine print on the owners' manual about kinds of DVDs that it plays""...like anyone does that. Palmpicture (the company that presses the DVD) also sent me a copy AFTER they had verified that it plays on their players. The problem is with the Toshiba player."
2,oh no...,"joey mcintyre has a very good singing voice, one that is made to belt out ballads and, in another life, show tunes on the broadway stage. but he is not (i repeat, NOT) a crooner in the classic style of the rat pack, and he shouldn't be attempting to replicate that sound. this is unfortunate because joey does have talent, it is just not being utilized at all in this album. let's hope that he is given an opportunity to let loose on some power ballads on the new NKOTB album (i can't believe i just typed those words)."
4,"""If you think you're lonely"" moves one to spirituality","""If you think you're lonely now"" elicits the soul renching inner being of Bobby.If you lsten carefully, his message in the song is delivered with the conviction of a master."
3,Not random enough,"I purchased this product and was happy about the number of packs I received, because I think I got more than 30. But, I was unhappy about the timeframe of the cards. I received packs from 1989-1994. It wouldn't be bad if I pulled some superstars, but they were mostly common cards, worth like $0.10 a piece. I would buy it again if I could get a more wider range in years."
1,Bunch of Bad Wax Packs,"I received 5 1991 Fleer, 5 1990 Score Series 1, 4 1990 Score Series 2, 5 1989 Pro Set, 5 1991 Score Series 1, 2 1990 Pro Set, 2 2009 Rookies and Stars, 2 2009 Rookie Class.I was expecting some assortment of years, not a bunch from some terrible years. I Googled the value of wax boxes of these, and most run $10 for 36 packs. $25 for 5 of each? That's ridiculous.I suggest going onto eBay or somewhere else for your cards. I am sure I got ripped off for at least $15 (60% of the value).Enjoy it Mr. Seller."
5,Excellent classic cuban son,"This is a must have for the cuban son-afficionados. It's solid, great music, in the classical form, that'll keep you entertained for hours. I have three or four of CDs like this and put them on a loop during the day, haven't gotten bored of it yet :) If you like those, check out Mas Cube Libre, and the Israel Lopez Cachao Descargas CD."
5,A Must Have,"I already had this same book for the Southwestern States so I knew it would be good. It's a very useful book, with very detailed directions and information. This book is a good overall guide to the Northwestern States."
4,A Review,"If you like to visit hot springs in the North West. This is your book. I own Jason Loam's original hot springs book and this new one has mush more detail and better directions, plus they have added quite a few new springs! It is a must have for Hot Springers."
4,good job,"Hasn't let me down yet. Good descriptions. Accurate, not always the best route in but definitely got me in until I found the local route :)"
3,Gets out of date...fast,"As with any travel book - they tend to get dated quickly. This book is great for the commercial hot springs, but watch out on all the ones which require off-road or trail travel - google them first before going.Several in BC were simply not where they should have been.GPS coordinates would have been helpfull to include."
3,"Ok, Equal to what you can Google",I didn't think this book provided any more information than what can be found on the internet. I would not buy it again if I had the chance.
2,Not sure if you can get cat pee smell out of anything,This was another attempt at trying to rid our house of cat pee smell. This product didn't really live up to its name.
1,Waste of money,"After trying many, many products in the market I decided that paying much more was going to be worth it if there was a solution to the problem with my 2 Pomeranians urinating in the tile floor. Before spraying this product I cleaned the problem areas with Clorox disinfectant and used a damp cloth to let it dry for an hour. I sprayed lots of anti icky poo on the tile floor, frame doors and all the specific problem areas then went over again with a dry cloth so the areas were not soaking wet and let it dry. This was done a couple more times till I considered there could not be any more smell residue from urine. Imagine my surprise when I realized it had not worked at all."
4,worth a shot,"My female cat was spraying pretty badly so I bought this in an attempt to get the stink out of my dad's leather chair. I can not smell any kitty spray, but my dad says he can, which it why I gave 4 stars. I like the smell of the Anti Icky Poo, it's kind of a fresh smell, though I believe I read a review that thought it was more chemical like. Though my cat still sprayed, I would recommend the product because it's certainly worth a try!"
5,AMAZING!,"This stuff is the best stuff I have ever tried. We have a kitty that likes to spray in our daughters room, the smell was horrible. We found this product and tried it out... you would never know that the cat sprayed in there. I can even put my face up to the carpet and the smell is GONE! BUT, I used it about three times before the smell was totally gone. It worked good on our puppy accident spots also."
4,Seems to work really well,"Although my dachshund puppy is mostly potty-trained, she still makes occasional mistakes on the carpet. I've heard that dogs like to go to the bathroom on the same spot so I definitely didn't want. I got this and it seems to work. She hasn't peed on that spot since."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,This product did not work at all. Our cat urinated on the couch and we tried this but it didn't help. We wound up getting a different couch. Woolite or oxyclean works better.
3,Cuts the Odor,"This product cuts the cat urine odor, but does nothing to keep the cat from coming back again. It seems equal to any of the other products we've purchased at the pet stores."
1,Worthless,Masked the odor at first but didn't get rid of the smell in the long run at all. Waste of money completely.
2,"Takes the edge off, but that is it","Our friend's cat came over and decided he liked our couch better than the litter box. I used this product, let it sit over night and then cleaned the couch with a steam cleaner. It took the edge off the smell, but that is it. I did 4 treatments with this, and still the smell prevailed, until I used ""Kids and Pets"", which took the smell completely away after just 1 use."
1,Disappointed,"This was recommended to me by several friends who said it was the best product they had so far used for cat spray/marking odor. Over the last few days I have used it on carpet and so far it has only slightly diminished the smell. Only slightly. I soaked the area, have let it dry and reapplied. Still no better. So! while I very much wish this had done the trick my carpet still stinks."
2,Multple steps,The description online says it's for things including feces but the packing when it comes in the mail does not include that problem. And there are 3 other products that depending on your circumstances you may have to use as well. I wasn't looking for a easy fix but I certainly wasn't looking to make it more complicated.
4,Product works great,"Box was a bit crushed, don't know if it will affect the performance of any of the box of 100."
5,Tegaderm Never Disppoints,"As a dialysis patient with a lower arm fistula, I need something water-tight to occlude my fistula when I apply Emla cream before my treatment. As an RN, I know that Tegaderm is the perfect dressing for this use. Fast service, great product! I recommend it and this seller highly. Thank you!"
5,Everything You Might Want to Know about Dyeing,"This was a great ""refresher"" course for me in dyeing protein fibers. Everything is right there on the DVD, all pulled together into categories and most helpful. Glad I bought it and will probably review it the next time I go on a marathon dyeing spree to make sure I haven't forgotten anything."
2,KISS OR KILL DOES NOT DELIVER,"The premise of this movie looks good on paper. Two lovers running from the law on the highway, murdering human obstacles. And the awards it won (Australian movie of the Year, etc.)may lead you to believe that this is a movie not to be missed. But don't be fooled. It's a barely competent thriller, with only a minimal level of suspense and a threadbare storyline. The film bogs down completely halfway through, and the ending is unsatisfying. Avoid this overrated picture."
3,Love,I saw this movie only because I saw LOVE AND OTHER CATastrophes which Frances O'Connor and Matt Day were in. When I watched this movie I had no idea what to expect and after seeing it I realize I still don't. it's the love story between 2 people in love who run around the country. There are a couple of scenes that had nothing to do with the movie.But all in all not the worst movie I've seen.
3,Watchable,"Good acting. A bit of a downer. Everyone is so miserable. Watchable, not memorable. Not a feel-good movie by any means. KB does a great job, nonetheless."
2,The title it's too much for this book,"I can't say this book is a waste of time, but at least for me it was, when you read a title like ""The Ultimate Windows 2000 System Administrator Guide"", you think it's going to be a great book, but this one is far from being great, I wanted something more explicit, by this I mean I wanted more theory and what I did get was only screen shots, this is totally useless for me, the only utility I find for the book it's as a paperweight, you know what I mean, if you want to waste some time, buy this book it won't disapoint you in this respect."
5,Must Have Reference,"This book made such advanced topics as Active Directory, Kerberos authentication and virtual private networks easy to understand and implement. This 1000 page reference is packed with solid how to information. It also provides easy to follow background data that cuts through the jargon to the real meaty stuff. This is going to the front of my bookshelf. I strongly recommended the book."
1,Big disappointment,"Yes, I thought that book would be a good help for my work as an administrator, and it ended up being a big disappointment. I have read a lot of computer books in the last three years as I passed my MCSE exams, and this is the most poorly written I have come across. There is no linear thinking about how things work, you often have to guess what the author is talking about, which makes reading at time confusing. It's always a sign to me when I have to read a paragraph three times to understand what the author really means, and then realize it wasn't that complicated, but was only written in a clumsy way. Lot's of guessing work. Definitely not my cup of tea..."
4,to many pieces,I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loves it but there are way to many little pieces that end up on the floor. It is well made and she does enjoy it.
5,love it,"Don't have cable or internet so able to view this on dvd, loved the series and nice to watch one chapter after another and not have to wait a week if I didn't want too. Makes lots more sense when you can view it all at once"
3,Great movie - squashed packaging,I'm disappointed that the packing for this series arrived with squashed ends. It doesn't look as nice now in my collection. But the DVD series is just as good as I remembered.
4,"Almost history, but not quite","Jonathan Rhys Meyers is amazing as Henry VIII. I got over expecting him to be fat and got into the complex character of the man. The writing is wonderful and the tension builds, however, crunching two characters into one and misstating events rather annoys me, hence only 4 stars rather than 5. Henry's elder sister was Margaret, and she married James IV, King of Scots. She re-married to Archibald Douglas. Then, we have Mary Tudor, the younger sister, and queen consort of France by marriage to Louis XII. After his death. she secretly married Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, without Henry's consent. Big uproar. But where did either of them marry the King of Portugal and suffocate him in the marriage bed??? Artistic license only goes so far and cannot re-write history. Oh well, I still enjoy the great acting, the writing, the costumes, sets, etc."
2,it was damaged,"it was first delivered to the wronge place,if the people down the road weren't honest i wouldnt have even got it.it was also late.when i opened it,every single disk was damaged and had issuse reading.because it was late i couldn't return it so i'm stuck with this damaged set.i like the show and i like amazon,but this was a verry bad buy and i don't recomend it.thanks for reading"
1,NO CAPTIONS!,"My one star is based solely on the lack of captions. I loved the series, but of course, there were captions through the tv. There are many people who rely on captions when they watch DVDs. Older viewers whose hearing is not what it used to be and viewers whose second language is English are particularly helped by close-captioning and/or subtitles. In fact, many people learn English quicker by watching films with subtitles. Considering how many movies have captions, it can't be very difficult to offer them. I bought the first season and was disappointed that captions were not included. I was about to purchase the complete season, hoping that there would be captions for the final boxed set, but since I don't see captions mentioned in the properties, I guess I'll save my $70.00. Maybe I can spend it on ""The Borgias"" if that studio has the courtesy of supplying subtitles."
3,Blu-ray Please,LOVED this series on TV. Waiting for the complete series to be available on Blu-ray. No reason to buy it on DVD.
4,Passion,"Excellent show. Some good historical facts too, but best is King Henry and his love of women described. He loves with great GREAT passion and hate the same way.Interested in some history and great love affairs. This one is for you."
5,THE KING IS COOL,"I WATCHED THE SERIES WHEN IT WAS FIRST ON TV. THEN AGAIN WHEN IT WAS IN RERUNS. DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT AND WOW, JUST AS GOOD THE THIRD TIME AROUND. THE ACTING, SETTINGS AND COSTUMES WERE ALL 5 STAR. IT IS ONE OF THOSE SERIES THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO SEE THE NEXT EPISODE RIGHT THEN. AMAZON HAS ALWAYS TREATED ME FAIR WITH GREAT PRODUCTS, FAST SERVICE AND FAIR PRICES."
1,Poor Quality DVD,I received Tudors as a present from my daughter. The first set had issues with a lot of scratched up disks making it impossible to properly hear or see what was going on. My daughter complained and a second set reached my home. This set was actually worse than the first set. The first disc was tremendously scratched up and could not be used. It seems to me that there is something wrong with DVD's sold as new that are so defective. Where did David Pereira get them from??? Perhaps he should get his money back. Also the discs seem to be numbered incorrectly.
4,Wonderful series,"My wife and I loved watching the series on tv, this is one of those things you can watch over and over again and pick-up on something you did not catch the first time. Well worth the small investment. After reading some of the other reviews about disc quality, our disc set is flawless, no issues. The only reason I gave a 4 not 5 is because there seems to be some parts cut out based from the original showtime tv series that i watched on tv. (not much but some). After receiving this order, I immediately bought two more as gifts."
5,Wonderfully done,"Just as described and beautifully packaged. The sets and costumes are amazing. Also, entertaining to watch and to try and spot the historical differences."
1,"1/2 of the DVDs didn't play, but the co. returned my money, so mon. tomorrow I'm sending it back","1'2 of the dvds didn't play, they would just stop and the machine would sound like it was trying to read it."
1,Disc Issues,"Ordered because the price seemed great. The packaging looked like it had been opened once and resealed; frayed edges on the box, some disks looked marked up and the plastic wrap was loose.. The discs all seem to have areas that skip. Cleaning the discs does not resolve the issue. Very disappointed in the purchase but from reading reviews of the box set and individual seasons, which I should have done before the purchase, it seems this is a common issue due to low quality of the product in general."
3,"Series compelling, but discs a bit of a problem","I bought the series at the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was an amazing Henry VIIIth. He is so regal so effortlessly that he brings instant credibility to his role. I didn't mind the poetic license used in some parts of the series (even though I am an English history buff).My rating of 3 stars is because of the difficulties encountered in Series 2 and 3 with the discs. There was some flaw in those two sets that prevented the DVD player from moving on to the last episode on the disc. The last episode couldn't even be accessed by choosing it from the episode menu. After some experimentation, I found that I could access the last episode on the discs by using the scene forward button and getting to it from the second last episode on the disc. For shame, techno geeks. Other than that, the packaging is pretty and ingenious."
2,Lousy Discs!,"AWESOME series! Too bad we could not warch it in its entirety, however. I wish I would have paid more attention to the people who said they had problem with the discs. About a third of the way into the series, we experienced difficulties with the discs and could not continue. What a letdown since we were enjoying is so much! Amazon Customer Service is assisting us - but we will have to purchase it somewhere else...DO watch it though! :)"
1,defective nerchandise disks would not play Apperas flawed from manufacture,"the series is excellent but the package I paid 70 $ for is a ptece of junk, If you buy this item cneck it our at once for defects At first I thought it was only the first disk then 2 nd the second more junk WIL NOT PLAY Perhaps defective in manufacture . Suggest you investigate item at omce if you buy ftom this compamy, They did offer to replace first disk but the whole DVD seies is flawed BE careful !!"
2,Not happy,So far at least 3 disks have been defective. I felt the gift I gave was not up to Amazon's reputation. The packaging was OK but some of the disks were not in the album correctly
5,Love it.,I had the flu over Christmas and I had seen this on TV. I was so happy that I got it at a great price!
1,BLU-RAY PLEASE? It's 2011.,"Unless the manufaturer has a TON of regular dvd to sell of this series and they're trying to get as much money from them as possible, I see no reason why this series in not available for a US blu-ray release. What's it gonna take to make this happen?"
5,Awesome history lesson!,"This production is a history buff's dream. The acting was perfect, the costumes and scenery were accurate and most of all, the historical accuracy was 90%. (They had to use some poetic license here and there.) Overall, the experience was worth every cent."
3,captions (CC) activation-how to do.,"A major problem with this product has been lack of captions for the hearing impaired, and older people as others have reported.In the menu presentation, captions are highlighted, but cannot be activated by the DVD player controls.A solution to this problem involves using a laptop (or other ) computer, and playing the DVD through thecomputer drive, connecting the computer HDMI output to the TV HDMI input. On the DVD player screen on thecomputer, click 'features' then 'closed captioning' then ,'on' and it should work. All subsequent controlof play, pause etc. would be under the control of the DVD computer program.Worked well for me. Shame on the producers. Happy watching."
5,Informative and Captivating yet Erotic,"King Henry is one of the most intriguing and yet flawed characters of history. You'll find yourself drawn in by his human qualities of desiring power and sex while also demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of what his goal is as King.Once you start watching The Tudors, you won't want to stop. The stories are well woven and the love scenes are top notch. Perfectly cast and expertly directed."
4,"Great show, but don't watch with your aging parents","While this series was generally good with not taking too much license with altering history for dramatic effect, it certainly did make the sixteenth century more sexy. So much so, that if you have aging, well-read parents who enjoy history, but are a bit conservative in their tastes, I must advise against watching this show with them.We were visiting my parents for a weekend and brought along a disk to watch in the evening. Well, rather than going to bed early as I expected, they asked what we were watching, and joined in after we told them it was about Henry VIII. I thought we were in the clear until the very last scenes of the episode, when Henry fantasizes about doing the deed with Anne Boleyn in the woods. Nothing quite like the awkwardness of watching softcore porn with your parents. Be advised!"
3,It was ok,"The set itself is nice, i love the case it came in, but most the discs skipped and i would have to go back and rewind it to attempt it to play through or just skip the scene all together. I love the series either way so i can deal witg missing a scene or 2 on most discs."
3,INFAMOUS,"I can write a five page review, however I won't because I do have a life. This is an interesting take [inside view] in the life of the infamous Henry VIII. We get to see Henry have many tantrums because he does not get his way. From a historical perspective, of course, it is from a British point of view- thus I do not know how accurate it. None the less, it is an entertaining series. Although it could have been done in one season, rather it drags too many seasons. I give it one thump up!ps the first season is the best"
2,crud,"I don't understand: if they were going to get so far off ""history,"" by stressing the lurid aspects of this story, if they were going to fudge so much . . . why didn't they just bring in some fantasy writers to change the names up to be a bunch of fictional kings and battles, kind of like ""Game of Thrones""?How much work would that have been?"
5,The Tudors,"I could not tear myself away from the series. The story was riviting and actor portraying Henry the Eight, as well as his wives especially the character Ann Bolin held me captive. ( attention wise ) Warning though, If you are a History buff, you might find that there are some inaccurate events. However, over all, the series are very entertaining."
5,Awesome!!,The best series I've seen in a long time! I loved watching every episode. This complete series is going to be a gift for my dad. It shipped quickly!
4,The Tudors,"Although too sexually graphic for my taste, an interesting lush production of Henry VIII's personal and professional life. Annoyingly historically inaccurate in places (for example, Cardinal Wolsey did not commit suicide while confined to the Tower, but actually died of illness in a monastery just prior to being arrested...always a master of timing). Nonetheless presents a compelling overview of the passions and politics of the era. Touches upon the terror his daughters must have experienced as they were in and out of favor, promised in marriage to various and sundry suitors, then had promises reneged. Beautifully staged and costumed with a magnificent cast of actors."
1,Great Show Great Packaging Difficult Discs,I agree with the other reviewers.The packaging and extras are terrific. What is there to say about the show that already haven't been said? Its a beautiful show to watch and its pure entertainment.The discs are difficult as in they freeze up. I'm so very glad that I bought this set as a 'Gold Box Deal of The Day' because otherwise I'd return them immediately for a refund. Its a real shame too because clearly there was a lot of effort put into the beautiful packaging.Too bad that they skimped on disc quality. Show 5 stars. Packaging 5. Discs 1.
5,WHAT A GREAT PRODUCTION,"This series is one of the best that has ever been made for television and it was great to watch all four seasons in sequence. The cast members were superb, the costumes, the ambiance, everything was high class all the way. I'm not sure of the complete historical accuracy of the show but what a great story! Johnathan Rhys Meyers was excellent as the king and his performance never waivered from start to finish."
2,Tudor's Disappointment,"I was so excited to receive the entire collection of ""The Tudors"" and set aside an entire weekend to watch them all. As I watched one DVD began to freeze and by the time you fast forward you missed quite a bit. This happened on nearly every single DVD. Amazon was great though, they refunded my credit card completely after I sent the DVD's back. So disappointing!"
3,Tudors is great. The seller wasn't.,I purchased this amazing television series for a friend who I knew would enjoy as much as I had. Unfortunately two of the DVDs that the seller sent were unable to play and my friend missed many episodes including the finale. Very disappointed with the seller.
1,"Cliffs Notes summary of ""HUM AAPKE HAIN KOUN""","FIRST HOUR: Handsome Prem meets beautiful Nisha and they fall in love.SECOND HOUR: While Prem and Nisha keep falling love, their relatives also fall in love!(*INTERMISSION* Go get your pickle and chutney.)THIRD HOUR: Prem and Nisha fall EVEN MORE MORE in LOVE than before!!! Try not to laugh when one of the relatives falls down a flight of staris and dies.FOURTH HOUR (brace yourself, surprise ending): Prem and Nisha are so in love that they decide... to get married!The end."
2,A bit of a letdown film.,"This movies seems like it was meant to shock the audience and not much else,its attempt at the social commentary of our school sytems is quite laughable and mathew lillard is really easy to hate as the leader of the gang that torments neil patrick harris character. The films young cast are now big stars but when they starred in this cheap expolitation film they were all hungry young actors desperate for work. I was happy when the movie ended cuz near the end it got a bit overdramatic and needed to be shutdown.The director of this movie could have really made a great film if he would not focused so much on whats wrong with societies children.The director is to blame for the letdown of a movie this was.Im going to sell this dvd immediately cuz it doesnt deserve to be in my dvd collection."
3,Eye opening Movie,This is not the type of movie I usually watch. I found it to be an eye opening adventure in the minds of troubled teens. I thought Matt Lillard did a great job-his character really scared me. I also though Ryan Payne Bell did a great job. How come we don't see more of this actor? He did a great job playing the bad boy. Overall rating of this movie - 3 stars.
2,pretty weak,"Any comparison to ACO is a hollow one when it comes to this movie, which I'm giving a generous 2 stars to. It has potential, but is hampered by a low budget and awkward dialogue. Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Lillard make good adversaries, but the script simply isn't up to snuff. The events that conspire aren't very shocking or surprising; nor is the overly conventional ending. Some of the psychology between characters is interesting, but other than that this is a lost cause."
5,Tender story of adopting & raising Latin American children,"'Butterflies in the Wind' is a helpful book for parents raising children in a family with different race children. We adopted our lovely & vivacious 29 year old daughter, thirty years ago and I sometimes find it hard to explain to her, our journey and mission to adopt her. But Jean has helped me with this by writing this book. She has a special knack for putting into words, the many feelings, thoughts and struggles of parents and children. Her love and compassion for children shows through in many delightful anecdotes (I found my self laughing out loud while reading the section on 'teen' challenges). I appreciate her no-nonsense, unwavering approach to child rearing. The challenges of the 80s and 90s raising kids, were tough. But discussing the challenges never seems to take away from the main message of the book, that children are treasures to be protected, nourished and cherished in a family."
2,Appearances really can be deceiving,"This is the skinniest neck brush I've ever seen. It's probably only about 1"" in diameter. I'll take their word for it that it's real boar bristle but the ends are all raggedy and the bristles very sparse.I'd rather have had synthetic bristles and a brush that can really brush.Not a major investment, granted but now I have to order another and after this experience don't trust the pictures here on Amazon.com any more."
2,The bristles are bad,"They fall out during each use, pay more money and get a better brush trust me it will be worth it."
2,A little Small,It's a little on the small side. I guess I was expecting something a bit bigger around. This Neck Duster is of good quality though.
3,neck duster,what can I say its a neck duster the quality isnt great but I am also not a barber it does and ok job at dusting necks.
5,A MUST HAVE for all pointe dancers!,"I am a twelve year old ballerina and LOVE this foot spray! After pointe, it cools off your toes and makes them smell so good! After I put it on, everyone in my dance class wanted to use some!Definitely recommended!!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I used to use this when I danced 6 days a week and it helped keep my dance shoes fresh and as someone else said, it really helps cool your toes down after you take off your pointe shoes! Best of all, it smells nice and actually works better than the foot sprays I've seen marketed for athletes."
1,Worst lock design ever!,"This is perhaps the stupidest, most frustrating design I've ever seen in ANY product.The description says: ""This entrance set can be unlocked by key from the outside, while the inside knob is always unlocked.""What it should say is: ""Fool your friends and confuse your enemies with this great practical joke lockset!""We are CONSTANTLY locking ourselves out of the house and rooms we have these installed on. They come up with some B.S. about how it's safer - safer than what??? Sure, you can get out in a fire - but how about getting back in during sub-zero weather when you ran out to grab the paper in your robe?There are much more practical designs out there that are also safe in a fire. How about one that unlocks the door when you turn the handle? I can't think of a product I've ever been more disappointed or frustrated with.By all other accounts I am a reasonably intelligent man... but I defy anyone to go a month without locking yourself out."
2,"Great writing, but..","Weaving the variegated stories of a cast of characters, ""The Exquisite Corpse"" is a surreal tale of loneliness that paints vivid episodes, but doesn't seem to give a sense of wholeness, of completion to its tapestry. It's a bit like the energetic style of William Burroughs, but without the cohesion (for lack of a better term) his books contain. Yes, ""The Exquisite Corpse"" is quite fascinating and compels the reader on, but by the final page, the reader watches as the story flits away without leaving any imprint in the reader's mind. The novel is #78 of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels."
2,Be cautious of what it fits!,"I ordered this unit for a 1962 Ford F-100, with the stock 223 cu in 6 cylinder, based on all the information I could find on Amazon and Pertronix Web sites for fit.Sadly, it did not fit, and I would have had to significantly butcher the mounting plate to move the pickup close enough to the magnet. The instructions clearly state not to do that, that you need a different unit. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find out what the correct unit might be. Amazon promptly refunded my money & shipping costs, I am very pleased with their service. I still would like to have the correct unit, but my schedule seldom matches regular business hours. A proper fitment chart would be great - Pertronix does not provide one."
1,Disappointing Tea Kettle,"Bought this tea kettle as I wanted one that had an automatic opening spout. This in fact has an excellent handle design that opens the spout when you pick it up and makes it easy to fill the kettle with water thru the spout. However, the kettle doesn't always whistle and when it did, it sounded like a loud screeching horn and sputtered water from the spout and the lid when it boiled. I also found the kettle a bit on the large size (though most these days seem to be) for my personal use. Rather I have returned this for the Oxo Downpour tea kettle which I found somewhat better - a nice, consistant whistle though it also sputters a little bit of water from the spout and a slightly smaller size to my liking."
4,Copco Teakettle,"A teakettle is a fairly basic product, but there are a wide range of designs available, some better than others. This one has a basically intelligent design, but has a slight flaw. The positives: it is well made, feels solid, has a good grip on the handle, and has an innovative stopper mechanism. When the kettle is lifted, the articulated handle lifts the stopper for pouring. When the kettle is set down, the reverse happens and the stopper closes. So far, so good. The only problem is that when the water is boiling, steam rises, blows out through the whistle on the stopper and condenses on the outside of the stopper. If the kettle is lifted quickly, drops of hot water can spatter and hit the lifting hand. It's not a serious problem, but one has to be careful. Other than that we are satisfied with this product."
2,nice design,"This is a lovely kettle with a nice design. The main problem with the kettle is if you use unfiltered tap water, the boiled water tastes like metal. You can't make tea without using filtered water. Had I known this fact, I would not have purchased this kettle."
1,Two Episodes Damaged!!!,"The 2nd and 3rd episode on Disk 3 do not play - they skip and freeze constantly, the 3rd episode more than the 2nd, making it impossible to watch. Apparently, Amazon does not appreciate the concept of enjoying Perry Mason one episode at a time, so the ""return window"" has expired and they will not replace this defective disk. The episodes themselves (that play) are fantastic!! Amazon, wake up and revise your return policy!!"
5,Did not receive answer to my email,"I have lovely memories of watching Perry Mason with my Grandmother. I am happy to be able to see the shows again and relive those evenings with her. Also to see the interiors, clothes and cars of that era. However, I received this also as a gift for Christmas. I emailed this provider within two weeks of receiving the item to see if I could return or exchange. The item is still sealed in the orginial packaging. I did not get the courtesy of a reply. That was disappointing."
3,Blu-ray warning,This would not play on my Blu-ray player but works fine on DVD so make sure you have a DVD player before ordering this.
3,Perry Mason Season 4 Part 2,"One of the tapes is bad, unfortunately I have been sick and I haven't had the time to send back the tape. I received Season 5 Part 2 as well and it too had a bad tape. One bad tape on each is quite disturbing, but as I am scheduled for surgery on March 29th, I will not be able to do anything until atleast the week of April 11th.....As far as ordering and delivering that part of this was very nice as I had purchased Perry Mason from some company in Canada for which all seasons tapes were defective and my bank was unable to get refund and my shipment that I returned was rejected. That was a mess for me but your service was easy and secure and I did receive very quickly for which makes me feel good and not scared to order on line. Amazon is a reputable company that stands behind their products and in the future I will purchase through Amazon."
4,Starting to be predictable,I love the previous seasons but feel this is the last one I will buy. They start feeling the same to me.
4,An unsolvered case,"The last program on this DVD set has problems. I thought that the problem was that I was watching the DVD on my computer, but there were still problems on a DVD only player. The DVD came to an abrupt stop and would not play further. By going around the problem area I did watch most of the program."
5,Guaranteed Viewing Pleasure,"The Perry Mason series was always a wonderful program to watch. I watched the show as a child and enjoyed the plots than and even more, now.In addition to the 'mysteries', the continuing interaction between the main characters make the stories much more interesting. I also appreciate that these stories are not filled with a lot of gore, in living color. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in film-noir-type mysteries with a guaranteed surprise ending."
2,the first set with many subpar episodes,"I'm a big fan of Perry Mason and have the previous season sets. However maybe there was a reason this set V.2 was soft-pedaled. Many episodes are quite inferior to previous seasons. Several are almost agonizing to watch such as the Angry Astronaut, Tarnished Trademark, Melancholy Marksman and Counterfeit Crank. In some respects the preparatory story and characterizations (to the murder) are more elaborate than before but they end up getting in the way of the courtroom drama. In the Angry Astronaut episode for the first time I was more baffled than Hamilton Burger as Perry goes through a preposterous courtroom exercise. The actors including the judge looking on couldn't hide their own perplexity at what they were watching. I sure hope this is not indicative of season six and beyond."
5,One of the Best Series Ever,"One of my favorite shows. These are timeless, with excellent writing and acting. More dialogue than any other series, Raymond Burr having the biggest chunk.It stinks that they release a series in two parts for more money. Maybe they'll wise up on the remaining seasons, as sales begin to drop off."
5,The most convenient and comprehensive yoga workout,"I LOVE yoga but I never have time for it, and it's annoying following the same routine on a video or in a book. This program is GREAT! I can choose the poses I want to do, the order I want to do them in, and I can even watch my favorite TV shows while doing it (I know this is not recommended)...but it works me and I'm so happy to have my Yoga on the Go!"
1,Unhappy,Order based on reviews and will not use this cookbook. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this cookbook.
4,Who's Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?,"This movie is actually available for purchase as an official DVD release. It can be purchased through the Warner Brothers website. [...] are the addresses you go to. Look under the ""Warner Archive"" tab and search for the ""Mystery"" tab. [...] The back cover does state however, that ""this disc is expected to play back in dvd video ""play only"" devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and pc drives"". My copy did not play in an older DVD player I have, but did play perfectly in a newer DVD/VHS player. Just a warning. I hope this helps the fans of this great movie."
1,should be-No Stars,I ordered this DVD and it didn't work. I sent it back and ordered another and it also didn't work. I would still like to get a good copy of this movie. I haven't seen it in years but it is one movie I still remember something about because it was so good. I don't want to order it again and go through the same thing. I think Amazon needs better quality control.
4,PLEASE RELEASE THIS MOVIE TO NTSC DVD! I've been waiting since 1997!,"I bought my first DVD back in 1997. I soon built a list of movies I had to have, and this movie was one of them.Every few months I check to see if the movies I'm looking for, are finally put on the DVD list. This one finally made the list. Now if the studio executives would finally release this movie to DVD! Perhaps they need lots of good reviews from customers. That's why I've put in my review.If you want this movie on DVD... then add a review of it!"
3,"Light hearted romp, spoiled","I have loved this little film since I saw it in the theaters, decades ago. I waited for the film to finally be released in DVD format. Unfortunately WB did us a great dis-service by producing the DVD, cheaply,without ""closed captions"". The many accents, of the delightful characters,and fast paced lines, and gags are lost to those of use who are older, and now hearing impared. While many other films in the WD Archive Collection are captioned, one must be very careful when collecting further films.Segal, Bisset, and the delightful Morley, are incomparable. While the parts are played rather broadly, we must not forget, this is a comedy. The location filming all over Europe adds a fun side to the film. A mixture of fantastic foods,kitchen antics, light reparte' and grizzly murders, makes the film entertaining."
2,"Two stars for the transfer, four stars for the film. It deserves a better release","This is an entertaining film with great performances and visuals. But the 1978 print looks like it's a 12th generation copy that is fuzzier than some video tapes I've seen. It's too bad. The Warners Archive project is a good one, with some releases (such as the late 50's ""Captain Sinbad"") actually look great. But this mystery/comedy with George Segal and Jacqueline Bisset isn't one of them. If you can rent it, do so to catch Robert Morley's great bombastic performance as a food magazine owner. There are a lot of famous European actors who have guest spots in the film as great chefs. This was an odd choice to relegate to archives as the film has an audience from years of broadcasts on cable TV in the 1980s."
5,DVD please,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. My husband and I quote from it on a regular basis. With so many films now on dvd, I can't understand why this one hasn't made the list.Amazon, please help."
3,Nothing special,This movie was just okay. Wouldn't watch it again. I expected more. Guess I like the oldies best! Didn't hold my attention the whole way through.
4,Great classic movie,"This classic movie has some wonderful acting and actors. The theme is great and in some places hysterical. I waited forever to have Amazon.com reduce the price of this item, but didn't happen, however, I went to Warnerarchive.com and there is was, cheaper then Amazon and even free shipping, so I ordered a few more movies. It is an outstanding film."
4,Savour,"How wonderful to view a film that truly appeals to all your senses. Filmed at a time when political incorrectness was unheard of, smoking was savoured and not considered a dirty habit, the preparation, consumation and thorough enjoyment of food uninhibited, the actors diction is clearly audible and without the use of (now)common day expletives used as adjectives.Original. Subsequent food films are but a drop of sizzling butter to burn away into browness.Unfortunately the world has lost a great actor in Robert Morley but Jacqueline Bisset, George Segal and Nigel Havers are still kicking about.The movie is as good now as when I first saw it in my late teens although now I can also appreciate better its particular nuances.Thank you Amazon for having the film in stock. It is a shame that film makers do not produce anything this good any more or writers turn to witty prose suitable for decent actors who have not come out of the Hollywood factory."
3,Who is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?,I'm happy that was possible to find this film. Unfortunately without subtitles. I'm looking forward to seeing this film in quite moment. The delivering was really fast. Thank you very much.
2,manufacture-on-demand quality problems?,"Like so many others who posted here, I love this filmand was overjoyed when I saw that it had become available.However, Amazon is currently 0 for 2 in sending me a DVDthat will play reliably on my gear. The first copy Ireceived was fine for the first 40 minutes and thenstarted hanging for seconds at a time until the 45minute mark, at which point things got smooth again.This happened on all 4 different devices I tried it on.The replacement copy struggled similarly through thefirst 10 minutes but was fine after that. I'm going tokeep it, but....."
5,Loved this book!,What a wonderful book - both in content and illustrations - sent to my nephew over in London and it is now one of his favorites.
2,Birds of Belize,"This IS NOT a field guide! The book is large, heavy and poorly organized. The art work is basic with no fine details. Photographs, descriptions and maps are in three different locations. The maps are barely small ink line drawings that have no detail at all. The information in the descriptions contains a lot of words but not much useful information about habits, habitats or unique charicteristics that would differentiate between similar appearing species. While it may be the best you can get for Belize it is a far cry from many other field guides. I would recommend locating field guides specific to the areas you will be visiting, like Albert Greer's Birds of ""Ambergris Caye"", which unfortunately does not appear to be available on Amazon.com."
2,Not perfect!!,This book is organized with the bird illustrations in the front and the information in the back which is not a very convenient way to lay it out. It means a lot of flipping pages!! Plus it weighs almost 2.5 pounds!! I'm not hauling that much weight all over Belize. Sent it back today.
3,"Too heavy, poor map experience, decent images","I had previously used the Petersons guide to Mexico and Central America as my guide book in Belize. While the book suffered in that it really wasn't a guide to Belize specifically, it did have better images and a more respectable size. The Jones book I find is poorly organized, especially with regard to maps. Not all birds actually have maps and you have to first find target birds, go to the dscription and then to the maps tyhat are there. But it really is the size issue that is problem number one for me. If you are a dedicated birder and are only taking this book and binoculars you should be fine, although don't think about putting it is a large pocket. If you are also bringing any long optics though it's going to be burden to you, no doubt. I don't know how this would fair as a ebook, but perhaps that's a better direction to take with this book."
5,Perfect book for research before trip!,"This is a very nice, comprehensive book and I have enjoyed thumbing through it. I plan to study it a bit more before heading to Belize in January. The only drawback is that it is pretty thick and heavy, but I knew that before I bought it as I had read other reviews."
4,The essential Belize bird book,"If you're birding in Belize with one book, this is the book you must have.What I don't like is the layout. One section is for drawings with short, general habitat descriptions. Then you go to a second for much more complete descriptions. Then to the third section for a limited number of range maps. You have to go to the second section just to find the page number of the range map or if there even is one."
4,Birds of Belize - THE book ;o),"We are into preparations for our 14 days of ornithology in Belize in February 2006. It is a first birds watching trip for my husband and I. We are fortunate to have a friend who a made few and shares her experiences with us. Yes, the book is too heavy for the field... Following her instructions, we went to a printer store and had the book cut in 2 parts, the texts and the pictures. They have made 2 books; one that we will bring with us and the other that will stay home or in the luggages. We have also added a french index that our friend had made (Thanks to you M.) at the new picture's book that will be very helpfull to us in the field. We will also mark beside the pictures if the birds are common, rare, very rare.Sue"
5,#1 Herbal Products Manufacturer,"I have successfully used L-Theanine capsules for a few years to help alleviate anxiety in stressful situations (such as interviews, or meetings with the boss). One capsule seems to calm me down enough to eliminate excessive perspiration, and to not make me appear flustered. I have tried other brands (same ingredients and dosage) with less successful results. Based on my experience, Solaray is the #1 herbal products manufacturer available, yet keeps its prices very competitive. I would add that my local natural food grocery stores sells this item in a 45 qty bottle for $29. You can't beat Amazon's prices!!!"
4,Little old treasure...,"Glad Amazon offered this as a Kindle selection. Have seen it referenced in other books, but never came across a copy. Enjoyed the sections written in Olde English. While not as factual as most current historicals, still a must for ""Tudor"" readers."
2,Fireweed an O.K book,"FireweedDo you like books about love and war? If you do you, will love Fireweed. This book is about two young kids that find each other. They both ran away from their homes and families. They found each other and they fell in love. When this was going on, there was a war. This war was WWII. This war was very dangerous and they were tying to survive it. This took place in London. This book is about beating the odds and surviving with each other.The characters of this book are called Bill and Julie, but the boy in this book lies about his name. His real name was not Bill. I really didn't like this book. I guess I'm not a person that likes to read books about love and war. This is not my type of book to read. When you would read this book, you would know what would happen next and that did not make it interesting. It's like, if you know what was going to happen next, why read the rest of the book? But if you like books about love and war, this is the book for you."
1,Fireweed,"This book was the most boring book I have ever read. I did not enjoy it from the start. It is good for people who like reading about love stories, but for people who don't like love stories this is NOT the book for you."
2,Fireweed stinks!!!,"In my own opinion this book wasn't very good. It is about a boy and a girl that run away from their families. They tell everybody that they are brother and sister and that their names are Bill and Julie Vernon-Greene. This book is unique because it takes place a long time ago. It takes place during the 1940's in London during WWII. This book is written in the form of a novel. There are blazing streets, toppling buildings, air-raid wardens and Rescue Squads. I didn't like this book because I'm not interested in those books that take place a long time ago."
5,Memorable,"Fireweed is a coming of age story in WWII London. Two teenagers learn about self-reliance and responsibilities as they survive on their own during the bombing of London.Ms. Walsh captures the angst, selfishness, and drama of the young having to cope with a world that is suddenly changed forever, as well as the resilience and ingenuity that came with suddenly having to take care of themselves and eachother in a time when life continued on as bombs falling at any time became almost commonplace.I read this book first as a pre-teen. It has haunted me for years and is still touching now reading it again at 32."
3,"OK, Just OK","Although I loved ""The Emperor's Winding Sheet"" by the same author, this book left me a little cold. The attitudes of the teen boy did not seem like angst, (as another reviewer mentioned) but rather peevish, disrespectful, and out of sync with the times. I often had the impression that his viewpoint was that of a bitter full-fledged adult instead of a 15 year old. I will admit to having not finished the book. Perhaps if I could have got all the way to the end I might have cried like another reviewer did. But again, I put it aside because of the off-putting tone. This may have been a good Young Adult book if the author had taken a different approach.On the plus side, the detail included about the blitz and living conditions in London was very well done!! A child with a WWII passion could easily enjoy the book from this aspect."
2,Hard time in London,"The book Fireweed was about a boy that said his name was Bill (but that really wasn't his name) and a girl named Julia Vernon-Greene. They had both ran away from their families and went to London. This had taking place in London during the 1940s while London had been being bombed and there had been toppling buildings, air-raid wardens, and rescue squads. It was an ok book, but it wasn't interesting enough. I didn't think it was that great because it didn't have enough action going on and the ending just left me hanging and I didn't like that. Another thing that I didn't like was that there wasn't really a problem and the little problem they did have wasn't solved totally, so it confused me in the end. I liked that the story had a nice plot and moved along, but it just wasn't that interesting. Also, I liked that it was a quick read."
4,Fireweed,Fireweed was a very good book. It is filled with excitement and danger. Fireweed is about a boy named Bill and a girl named Julie. They meet eachother in a refugee camp that they are staying in. Both of them had previously ran away from foster homes they were sent to because of the war. When they met in the camp Bill introduced himself to her and she ran away from him. He chased after her and when she finally talked to him she realized he wasn't trying to cause trouble they started to hang out. If you enjoy books with a lot of action and drama this will be a good book for you
2,One of the most boring books I've ever read!,"Do you like a book that everything good happens at the end of the book? Well, if you do this is the book for you. Fireweed is about a two young teens named Julia and Bill who both run away from home. While they're gone, they meet each other and they fall in love. They learn to live life together. This book's setting is in the early 1940's during the war.I think Fireweed is an okay book. I feel it could have been a lot better. I think you should read this book if you are kind of bored and have nothing else to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books from old times. To me it was not a good book. What makes me not interested in this book is the fact that it happened in old times and I'm not really attracted to books like this. This is how I feel about the book Fireweed."
4,Very well written,"Very well written. Indepth, with plenty of references.May be a hard read for the novice though."
1,Doubters guide to the bible,"Perhaps the book might be more aptly named ""Doubter's Guide to the Bible"". He not only puts forward many of the more radical modernist theories, he basicly puts his stamp of approval on most of them. For example, that Paul didn't write the Pastoral epistles, and many of his other epistles like Colossians, Ephesians and others are also doubtful. That John didn't write all the books in his name. That neither did Peter write 2 Peter, or James write James, perhaps Jude either.Furthermore, that the bible does by no means present a coherent consistant theology. Rather every book has a somewhat different theology that can't be reconciled. Rather we have to prioritise the more important ones. Furthermore, we need to read the gnostic writings to really get as close as possible to what Jesus actually taught.I suppose if you want to know what the modernists are thinking, this gives some insight, but is this the Christian point of view?"
5,A great book -- no matter what twits think,"Another reviewer has mentioned that Krugman doesn't take into account that comparative advantages can change over time -- viz, that countries can actually create advantages. He cites Japan's auto industry as an example. Granting for the sake of argument that Japan, Inc. was good at creating certain industries in which it did well, I note a few flaws with his argument. 1) It's kind of outdated to point to Japan as an exemplar of superb economic policymaking. 2) Japan gave up many other things in order to ""create"" their advantages. 3) Competition in the long run improved the American auto industry. 4) It would be ridiculous to think that Krugman doesn't know about the impact of governments creating advantages in certain industries -- HE INVENTED THAT THEORY!!! (An oversimplification, obviously). Go back and read about the new strategic trade theory -- that's exactly what he's talking about."
3,life .....,the only reason I bought this book is because it is required class reading. So you can see how good / bad it must be.
2,No more stinky feet? more like...MORE Stinky feet!!!!!,"I'm sorry, maybe it's in my genetics, but I have always had really stinky feet, and that's never changed, plus it never bothered me. I decided to order this to see if it would give m any results, and guess what? it made my feet smell even worse!!? lol, I would much rather have the natural, sweaty smell of my feet...then this stinky smell, If it worked for others, then great.But me, I'll stay away from this stinky feet spray."
2,Dated,"I was looking for some timeless walking/running advice. This book was disappointing because it was very dated. There is an entire chapter devoted to what to wear and there are several pages on sprorts bras. Apparently, when the book was written, comfortable sports bras did not exist. Wow. Even beyond that, the author takes every opportunity to discourage people from using a treadmill. She does concede, however, that a treadmill is good if you don't want to mess up your hair in the wind while running. Really? Really?!! I have lost 15 lbs using my treadmill because I have to run early in the morning when my son is still asleep. In addition, I get such a great workout that I am drenched!! There is a lot of talk about the ""emerging"" world of women runners. It's like taking a trip back in time. I was not impressed."
3,Good book for motivation.,"A good source of information and motivation for those desiring to get active. Explains rather well how to work up to running if you've never done it before, kind of boring if you're a veteran or returning to running after time off."
4,Good informative book,"I found this book to be a very easy read, but filled with very useful information. I had been doing some walking outside and some running on a treadmill for awhile but never really started running outside or for any long distances. This book started me to, there were many questions that I found answers to, finding the right shoes, good stretches to do afterwards, training plans. All in all a good book for the beginner."
1,Too basic,"This book is a basic how to with obvious information. It is for the person who has never even seen a gym or a person run even from a distance. I am sure the ""motivational"" stories and good for some.. but not if you need more advanced technique or information that is beyond common sense."
3,"Good, but where are the","I purchased this DVD some time ago hoping that it would assist me in applying modal voicings, which it does. The video is a recording of an hour long live presentation given at the Berklee School of Music. The material is covered at a comfortable pace and Peckham presents effectively. What really bothers me, however, is that the Peckham refers to written materials during the presentation. The DVD does not include any written materials. They are not on the DVD, and I could not find them at the publisher's website. Should these materials been readily available on the disc or on the internet, the rating for this item would be much higher."

1,Good for heart palpatations,"Purchased this product as an alternative to the sleep & depression pills based on very favorable review of the product. After taking this at night it felt like my heart was going to pound through my chest. I chalked this upto my body getting used to the product, so i tried it an additional 3 days and each day was the same. My feeling is that the dosage (mg) might be to high or the product is not effective, but either way will not be purchasing. Will try Jarrow brand 5-htp instead."
3,great result with a side effect.,"i would advise one to take it before sleeping; it certainly brightens next day. Everything seems more colorful, vivid. you would feel energetic almost.However, i found this product to raise my heart rate up significantly after usage. perhaps 200mg is a bit too much; i would get palpitation and would feel uncomfortable due to chest pain also.Proceed to use with caution.+5 stars for its positive effects-2 stars for making my chest feel sensitive."
2,Not for everyone.,"I have heard many great things that 5-HTP will do for a person. However, my boyfriend and I both were nauseated all day whenever we take it. With a meal, at night, any way we tried. Please review side effects of this product and use with caution. I know it works wonders for many people, unfortunately I am not one of them. Good luck!"
3,"Too much, too little","I am new to 5-HTP and L-Tyrosine. I was hoping that this combo might be be good, but alas no. The 5-HTP dosage is too high for daytime use and the L-Tyrosine causes me to wake up after 4 hours of sleep.I have switched to the 100Mg 5-HTP and the 500Mg L-Tyrosine and am mostly happy with that."
5,sleep with dreams.,"ive been taking 5-htp for about a month. with valerian root, it will make you sleep, and for me, lucid dreams. one 5 htp and 2 valerian root(natures way standardized .8% valerenic acids) with a glass of water. and no real after effects the next day. i love it.have taken with GABA did not like."
4,I Learned A Great Deal,Found this book quite insightful. Kept my interest throughout. I learned many facts about both the Pope and the Papacy that I never knew. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to explore the origins of Catholicism.
3,"Not ""Full Flow"" as described","Item Title online says ""Full Flow"".Package does not say ""Full Flow"".Would be great between a hose and wand for watering plants or flowers. I would estimate water flow at full pressure is restricted approx. 30 percent. For high pressure applications this product did not work for me. Other then reduced pressure, I have no issue with product function or quality.Credit to Amazon.com for full refund and ease of return."
2,full flow shut off valve,"It stopped working after a few months and even though it looks very heavy duty but it is not shutting off the water any more . I contacted the seller but they said I have to pay for return shipping cost so, my shipping cost was about the same as what I paid for that item but I sent it back since it was the right thing to do."
1,Very poor quality product,"I purchased this valve because it looked to be of professional quality construction. The ""Pro"" is not professional quality. The lever hinge broke within days of purchasing when it was dropped onto the ground. Inspection of the hinge showed that it is way too flimsy for any type of long term use."
2,"Great flow, poor quality",I loved this until the shut off valve quit working after 2 months. Ive never had a dramm product that lasted more than one year.
3,Okay after fixing leak,It works just fine but the threads don't match up with the wand and they should. I insertrd a few nylon washers to stop the leaking and now okay.
1,Not full flow and quit working after 5 months,"As others have stated this valve is not full flow despite the claims that it is. When I used several spray attachments they didn't work very well due to not being full flow nor having straight through path as would be present in even a smaller ball valve.In addition to the first problem after 5 months it stopped shutting off. I tried various methods to get it working again to no avail. For $13+ dollars for a valve I expect a lot more for my money. Save your money and buy a tried and true ball valve, while they don't last forever they last a heck of a lot longer than this crappy valve and can be made to work again when the ball stops being easy to rotate.Steer clear of this product."
2,"Like others, both of mine stopped shutting off after 1 yr","Worked fine until it didn't. I figured it was the O rings, and the person who dissected his confirms this. Can anyone recommend a better product? I have one watering wand for outdoors & one for my greenhouse, and I'm sort of resigned to paying $22/yr for replacments."
5,this is a must t own!,"This is one of the best - if not THE best, that Florent has ever done. There is not a bad song on the entire disk - and his voice is as powerful as it has ever been. A lot of artists could learn from Florent and Rester Vrai - how to sing fantastically, how to write great songs and how to interpret other peoples' songs. This disc will not disappoint you!"
3,Leave it to Amazon/TRU....,Leave it to Amazon/TRU to take what was a Sam's Club exclusive and tack on an additional $10. :(
3,all purpose test,i tested this set by myself it was great in dealing with graphics programs and movies. it has one of the larger Hard disks available for a laptop in the same rank and price. with the sony technolgoies in screens it has the best screen resolution i have seen for a laptop..
4,X-Men Anime treatment,"As an anime fan and an X-Men fan, I have been waiting for this to happen. The X-Men has had many animated incarnations. From the 90's series, X-Men: Evolution, Wolverine and the X-Men, and now the X-Men gets the anime treatment. Although I still think that the original 90's animated series will always be the best, the anime series did well with story and character dynamics. I do hope that they will continue with the anime series and expand with more characters. This series deserves to be part of your X-Men collection."
1,Predictable.,"The X-men anime really did not include anything new or interesting. The plots here have been done repeatedly in the older cartoons and movies. Heck, Wolverine and the X-men came out just a couple of years before this and touched nearly the same main plot points. And it just feels slow. Stick with Wolverine and the X-men if you have the desire to watch a newer X-men cartoon."
3,Great art,I love the X-men. These episodes are ok. They move too slow for me. I really love the anime style and the designs for the characters but I feel like the story dragged on a bit too long.
5,Sweeping,"This book is a must read for anyone interested in a history of Germany. Not only does Manfield give an impressive story of the Krupp dynasty, but he also provides a broad history of the events that led to the unification of the German states, German international affairs, the interlocking relationship of German industry and government, a good history on the iron industry. The writing style is smooth and easy to read - Manfield also provides the translation of German words into English which is very important to readers not fluent in such a language - it seems that most other writers assume the reader to be fluent in French, Italian, German, Russian, etc. Don't be mistaken in thinking that this book is only about the history of Krupp - it is much more - it is an impressive work on the rise of the German Empire."
4,companion volume on Vickers would be much appreciated,"Manchester should write a companion volume on Vickers, THE biggest manufacturer of weapons at that time, shouldn't it be more easy than Krupp? It is a british company, right?"
4,Excellent book with annoying features,"This book is excellent for all the reasons mentioned in the other reviews. What I found REALLY annoying was the author's use of German quotes. He provides quotes, in German, usually somewhat abbreviated as shown by the use of ellipses, and then provides the translation of the entire quote in English. Since most of his readers can't read German, and the entire quote is NOT in the German version, why include them? More frustrating are the German phrases that he quotes and doesn't translate, leaving us to guess at their meanings."
3,Not What I Expected,"I've been reading a number of fiction and non-fiction books about WWII, and thought this book would be a logical follow-up to ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", one of the best books I've read in a long time.Although well-written, ""The Arms of Krupp was a disappointment, and I didn't finish it. After 200 pages, William Manchester was still writing in exhaustive detail about Alfred and his son Fritz and their day by day lives.If someone is interested in a biography of the Krupp family, I suggest this book."
2,Sing-A-Long Falls Short,"As a professional KJ in New Mexico the quality of sound and closeness to the original record is a must! I find that ""Sing-""A-""LONE"" vol.4 does not meet the standards that professional KJ's and DJ's demand. I will however give kudos and a hearty high-five on the price of the disc.In all fairness to the makers/producers of this disc, I will say that it is good for those just starting out in karaoke or the curious wanting to find out what karaoke is all about to purchase this item before they make (more expensive) purchases of karaoke discs or tapes."
1,What a real Eunuch has to say.,"I have not read this book but I am a real life Eunuch. I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says ""Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity."" WRONG!!! How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing."
2,Wish it was better,"I bought the Air Therapy Key Lime scent because I wanted a natural spray that did NOT remind me of a gym bathroom like most of the Orange-heavy scents do. I figured the Key Lime would be fresher, more tart, more...LIME-y. Instead, I pretty much got orange with a teensy smidge of lime. I do like the fact that it is not a chemical filled aerosol can, but it is not what I was looking for. If you don't mind scents heavyheavyheavy on the orange oil, go for this one."
5,Just Do It!,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and Jeff Crilley has you make your press release a desired objection of affection to the media. I know of no other book like it! As a former corporate executive, now business owner, I wish I would have know about this book years ago.He is a consumate professional and works to help anyone who asks. I have met too many people to count that have implemented Jeff's techniques with exceptional results. Many of them have been on national TV, including news shows and Oprah. To reach more people, Jeff is placing his free publicity tips on YouTube.Using Jeff's techniques, you can get Free Publicity. If you buy just one book as a PR primer, it should be this book."
4,Got Me Pumped...,"As I prepare to handle my own publicity campaign after being messed over by couple of publicist, I have read a plethora of books on the subjects. This one is my top five. It pointed out some things I hadn't even considered like the time of year. I am going to read it again (since it is a quick read) because I know there were some things I missed. Also, what I liked about the book was it confirmed something I had been suspicious of for years. Creative press releases get far greater attention than boring, run-of-the-mill ones. I am not a PR expert (yet), but when I read some of these press releases on some of the wires I have wake myself back up. Key thing to publicity is to find a way to stand out, this book really gives great tips on how to do that."
1,I Am Not Afraid,"An earlier reviewer stated that Phyllis Schlafly is a name that should strike fear into the hearts of femenists.I am not afraid.These women, especially writing together, completely lack a factual base for their over the top rantings and incomplete conclusions. There is nothing to be afraid of here; I feel only sadness for any woman who has been convinced, either by herself or her environment, that she is not worth her own rights.Femenism is evil, then, is it? This movement, which has kept women alive and fighting against physical and intellectual rapists, bigots from both genders, and mental illness and distress, should be smashed into the ground from whence it came?Call me militant. It's better than the bullied insecurity that Schlafly and Coulter try to pass off as strength and radicalism."
1,Still living in the dark ages,"This is sad. I thought that our country was a modern, cultured place where male chauvinism was long dead. It's one thing for a man to think feminism is destroying society, but quite another when a women does. What a shame that this author is so narrow-minded and blind to her potential as a woman."
5,Radical feminism is a pain for every decent woman!,"This book is a very important publication. Finally women are standing up, speaking strongly out against unreasonable demands from feminists, who are nothing but a small, however verbally strong group looking for advantages solely out of the fact, that they are women.Such feminism has nothing to do with gender equality, it is only a man-hating philosophy of life.This book, written by a woman is really a great book, I recommend it to everybody."
5,Timeless Principles,"Feminist Fantasies eloquently presents timeless principles that every woman of every age should read. If it is possible to share Phyllis Schlafly's brilliance, it is through reading her wisdom gained from first-hand experiences that span more than three decades.Schlafly's work will profit any woman with the courage to compare and contrast her accomplishments with those of the feminists. While many of them never married or had children, they now face devastating regrets, which underscores Schlafly's incredible success as the inventor of the pro-family movement that aims to defend and protect traditional families.Feminists would like modern women to overlook their foolish history, but smart women would do well to read Schlafly's book and then introduce future generations to it in hopes of preventing them from repeating the same mistakes."
5,The truth hurts doesn't it....ladies,"The book explains how woman/feminists are not actual harbors of original social thought/thinking, but only vessels of created-institutionalized-propaganda. In fact, most if not all feminist only spout-off what they themselves have been indoctrinated with. I must say that feminists have contributed to the destruction of the family, education, military and community, mindless fashion/arts/trends/clothing,image-based-trampy music industry, pornography, job-losses, moral relativisim, limp-wristed men, political correctness, homosexuality and lesbianism. So yes, they have done a lot. I am grateful for a REAL woman that can tell it like is or was. Maybe not all is lost...Hats-off to you Mrs. Schlafly."
3,Misses Some Points,"She has some good basic conservative ideas to share but fails to recognize that feminism is a search for female identify and confidence, which are good things, it is not just a political plot to overthrow motherhood.Not all of feminism is evil.She is a little too extreme on the right for my tastes, but it's a good read to see what the extreme right's logic or lack thereof is in the 21st century."
1,A Sad Book,"A sad book that completely overlooks the victories feminists have won for women in the past 50 years.Schlafly should take her own advice and stop writing, be obedient to her husband, focus on her ""faith and family"" and move to a Muslim coutry where it is standard procedure to treat women as second class citizens. There, she would have little to complain about."
1,Vapid Excuse for An Essay Collection,"It would be helpful if the woman cited her studies and statistics, but since she finds no reason to do so, I can't trust a word she says."
2,not fun,"great, arguments, valid points.Boring to read.in summation, good content, horrible presentation."
1,Out of Date/Out of Touch,"This collection of essays by Phyllis Schlafly essentially repeats her mantra: women don't really want equality and even if they do it is baaad. Her musings on the nature of masculinity and feminity are almost comically out of touch with reality. It appears her views have evolved no more frequently than her trademark hair-do, itself a relic of the 50s. Most unfortunate is that Schlafly's own life seems to contradict what she writes. Schlafly, obviously, is no stay-at-home woman. She herself utilizes the attributes of masculinity that she declares off limits to good, christian women. And what of the fact that childrearing using all her righteous indignation produced a gay son? Schlafly has all the charateristics of a feministy, yet she uses the term to label those whom she hates. The result is a book that seems dated, tired, and intellectually dishonest."
1,Against Church Teachings,"Beware fellow Catholics. Eugene is in protest of catholic teachings. I would stay clear. He has his own ideas on the prieshood and does not wish to follow long standing church teaching esp on celibacy and the religious life. The guy clearly has struggles in the book and is dissatisfied. No joy of the Lord here. No St Francis, Teresa of Avila, or Thomas Aquinas here. It's just sad he's publishing his thoughts. Plenty of other good authors. He should have left them in a diary. I'd avoid him when it comes to matters on faith. We don't need anyone else recreating their own faith and religion. Christ founded one, and it's still strong and going over 2000 years later, despite the attacks from without and within.FYI: There is little regarding ""faith"" or even ""Christ"" in the book, which should be a red flag."
5,When He Danced,"It is hard to believe that it has been 35 years since Sting started as a member of The Police. But it is his solo work that remains as timeless and simplistic and melodic as the singer himself. When We Dance is definitely a really great example. The song which appears off of Sting's Fields Of Gold hits collection still sounds just as simplistic and elequent as a butterfly flying on a mid-morning sunny day. I like the mood here, it is definitely relaxing, and because it is definitely one of Sting's best songs. If you have never heard anything apart from Every Breath You Take all this time, than you haven't heard When We Dance. I definitely recommend this song, especially over the cheap music singers are coming out with on radio right now.Song: A-"
2,Disappointing,"Not one of her best--I really wanted to like this book, but it was not worth the time it took to finish. Don't bother."
4,"A fun read, a good get away moment...","I did enjoyed this book, it was fun read and the story plot was fun enough to get you away from the every day for a while and yet, just enough real that you could see it happening...I have to say that Katie's books go up and down with me, I loved Men in Kilts! an all time favorite of mine, others of her's have me come and go, I do love the style she uses, of charaters with flaws, makes them very real!Keep up the good work Katie, and go ahead get this one, its fun! DJ"
5,Adidas soccer socks,These socks are high quality. I wear a size 10 shoe and they fit fine. Wash in cold water (in a net bag if you have it) and hang up to dry. I bought these as an alternative to wearing support hose and they work for me.
1,Terrible,"Not cotton. Very badly made. I do not think it is Adidas. From the quality, it is more like imitations you find in the black market.Size is correct. Fits."
4,Wonderful on the What - Brief on the How,"I love Scott Morrison's writings. I have found him to be truly committed to living in the now and manifesting Unconditional Love. I learned a lot fomr reading this thin volume.On the other hand, I myself find it difficult just to ""let go"" by telling myself to ""let go."" Telling myself to be committed to living in the present moment has not caused it to happen in my life so far. In that sense, this book might either be:A) An introduction to where you want to go i.e. creating your destinationorB) The last step in the journey - when you are the precipice of arrival."
4,There is only now,Definitely a good read ... wish I could follow the idea successfullybut somehow things are not as simple as that. But I will try!
5,Must reading for international business,"This is one of the most refreshing books about managing multinationals that I have read. It goes one step beyond the idea of a transnational, proposing a new model of how a company can succeed by prospecting the world for new knowledge about technologies and customer behaviour and using this to innovate. It won't be easy to implement, but the last three chapters provide a good starting point about how to make it happen. I was convinced that if we didn't try and build a metanational we would simply be left behind."
4,How Companies Win,"The world has changed and not just for business...However, business is the focus of the book and it a good read. Also, the best book I have read on this 'new way' on needing to look at our economy. Ron"
2,Nostalgia for Globalization,"The first two chapters tell you the picture and that is it. The kernel is summarized in a table at page 83 (end of chapter 3). Make a copy of this page, file it for later reference, and you are done. At best, this book reviews the vaunted wisdom of globalization, which many companies have been living at and dealing for years. At worst, it recites the squabbles between the global platform (the standardization) and regional initiatives (the deviations and the sensing ends). No specific solution or action is advised for the first & most obvious problem - how to transcend the intracompany transaction, which more than often bogs down companies attempting to quickly profit from the global learning."
1,GARAGE BAND WANNABE,"WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS BECOME AVAILABLE, UNTIL I BOUGHT IT AND LISTENED TO IT. SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE. HAVE LISTENED TO HIGH SCHOOL BANDS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THESE LOSERS -- THAT MEANS YOU RANDY O. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD -- PITIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,odin fight for your life,i remember seeing odin play with my freinds band leatherwolf and they put on a great live show and the music was as heavy as any other bands playing on the circut and their guitar player went on to play for armoured saint this album sounds great and certainly does them justice this album is a must for any 80s heavy metal lover
1,Pure Fiction...do not buy if you're looking for professional text,"What a sham of a book. This should be retitled,Hardcore Collections: A financial guide for felons and hustlers.I returned it after wasting $10 and 30 minutes of my time reading it."
1,Do not Read,"There are very few debt collection techniques that can be used in this book. Unless you care to get fired in the next week for violating the FDCPA, stay away."
1,Total Waste of my time and money,"In my opinion, this book is ridiculous and suggests doing things that are highly questionable."
2,"Personal collections, not for professional business","When I bought this book, I thought it would be for ideas on how to do collections in my professional office setting. I was dead wrong in my assumptions. It is more of a mafia ""pay back, back door"" type collection antics.What I did find, was that this book definitely gave me some laughs, evil thoughts of payback to my enemies and a whole new view on how things are done back door to get personal debts paid up. To sum it up, this book made me feel like breaking many laws and I found myself having to refrain."
1,waste of money,The author suggests that the collector enlist methods to get cash that are pre-FDCPA.Such as:1. personally going to the place of employment to harass him or her.2. Vandalizing the debtors girlfriends car.3. using a sling shot with BB's to crack the debtors windows4. and when contracting with clients to not give them your real nameand no signed contract because you don't want to be found.the list of illegal methods of getting cash goes and on and on.There isn't a spec of information that a law abiding person can use..I wanted info on what to say on the phone and this has nothing.Amazon needs to raise their standards and ban this book now!.
4,review,"The book was delivered on time and in good shape. The only shortcoming is, it is a bit shorter version of the original copy I read when I was young."
3,"Good, but not what I was looking for.","If you know some of the stories already, this review is for you. The stories deserve 5 start, but in my opinion for a book about 1001 stories, it ought to have all 1001 stories. Otherwise, it should say that somewhere in the title, thus the lower score."
5,"Love to cook, love these pans!","After much research, I decided to go with clad-construction stainless steel pans. All-Clad were out of my price range but these were just right when purchased on sale. I purchased these pans in December 04 and have been very impressed so far. They heat evenly and quickly. We've had a few things stick to the bottom (they are stainless steel after all) but they've cleaned up nicely when soaked in soapy water. My only complaint is that they scratch fairly easily. I've called the manufacturer and they've told me that minor scratches are to be expected since they are stainless steel. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend them to others."
4,the classic hot spring book,"If you like hot springs, this is the book for you! The most information in the easiest format to follow. The directions are better than most other books like it, Really I haven't found a hot spring book that compares, this one has been around a long time and it's still the best. Also has been revised so its up to date."
3,CD-R,"If you record something less than 80 minutes, this product does what it's supposed to do. If however, like me, you record something from the radio, for example, and you do not stop recording at least 30 seconds before the disc runs out, it won't finalize. It's not the disc I got but all of them. I called TDK and they said all the discs are like that. I don't have that problem with my Maxell or Memorex CD-Rs.Unfortunately, they don't make them anymore."
2,It's OK,"Hi!This CD is OK. The singer is very 'operatic' and not really accessible to my child. They don't include the lyrics so I can't sing along as I am a speaker of French as a Second Language and I had difficulty understanding what she was singing.I have other language/song CD's that I like a lot better like ""C'est Si Bon"". A lot more fun and 'danceable' for small children."
1,not all that great,The woman who sings the songs n the this CD has the WORST accent ever. I am very disappointed. I don't even want my daughter to listen to it!
1,This is not French!,"I had to stop listening before the end of the first song, so atrocious was the so-called ""French"" being sung... and it's not just the pronunciation, either!"
5,"Good, Nice, T&A","It's good to see real women showing T&A. Fat latins, Dark Latins, Old Latins, Young Latins, Light latins. I mean real latinas not some J-Lo or Silicone Barbies. Real T&A for real perverts!!!!!! I love Latina T&A!!!!!!!"
4,An Eternia Holiday,This video is very good. It teaches children tolerance for other holidays and that not all people celebrate the same holidays. The kids are really cute and Skelator is even funny in this video.
2,Worked well for a little while...,"I got this HDMI switch about five months ago, but it has started to act up in the past few months. I was beginning to have problems with both my DVD player and cable box, with the picture blanking out once in a while. I did some tests by disconnecting the switch and finally figured out that it was the switch that was acting up. I've disconnected it and gone to manually disconnecting the HDMI cable from behind the TV because those blank screens were driving me crazy. Just imagine how you'd like to miss a minute while watching your favorite TV show or a good DVD.I'd say it lasted about 2-3 months before I started having problems. So if you can buy it from a place with a good return policy, go ahead and try it out. Otherwise, avoid this and any switch that looks like this as it seems to be a common model which is rebranded differently. I bought from handhelditems who doesn't accept returns after 45 days so I'm out of luck. I'll be looking for another switch."
1,Complete junk,You get what you pay for!I used it for about five minutes until I realized it was creating DRM errors.Stay away.
2,Don't buy for the remote,"I bought this specifically for the remote control to the switch. The switch works fine, but the remote didn't work at all. The replacement they sent me also came with a remote that didn't work."
2,No.,"I know hohner makes good harmonicas, but this one was a cheap piece. It had two off reeds when I first got it. Not even worth trying to fix. The book's ok, but there are better."
3,Very small saddle bag,"This is a very small saddle bag. It's hard to tell just how big it is from the picture. This bag can hold a spare 26"" inner tube and that's about it. Other than size is a little on the small side, the quality of the bag seems to be pretty good. Zipper is very smooth."
4,...and the other half,"Sometimes, you don't know what you have until it's gone. I guess I never realized what an important element of Pavement Spiral Stairs was until I heard SM's solo album... while I love ""Stephen Malkmus"", it's missing the Spiral Stairs tunes that always served as such as great counterpoint to SM's erudite musings.Well, fear not, because there is almost an hour's worth of those tunes contained within the slime-green CD that is ""All This Sounds Gas"". The album is lo-fi sounding--- think pre-""Brighten The Corners"" sonically. Guitars sound real, drums primitive, vocals alive. Musically, it's guitar-pop with a few countryish touches. It reminded me a little of the Frank Black album ""Dog in The Sand"".There are some very strong tunes. Overall, I'm not as in love with it as SM's solo album, but it's a great, tunefull and well-written album that will spend plenty of time in any Pavement fan's CD player."
2,SS was Harrison to SM's Lennon &...,"...McCartney. So, I guess what I'm trying to say here is: if you're the kind of person who thought ""You Like Me Too Much"" was a really GEAR song, then by all means ante up and throw yer hard-earned pesos into Stairs' purse -- and smile while you do it, pal. Or at least pretend like you're enjoying it. That way you won't look like a fool. Really. You won't. ""'Cuz you like me too much / and I like yooooo.....""."
5,northwest mom,"my kids love it. I put it on in the car while driving. I know it isn't the best learning tool to teach 'exact' German, but my kids are familiar with the American tune, and remembers it because of it. I know they are 'learning' the foreign words when they say and sing back/ repeat the german tuned words."
1,DO NOT BUY,"i've never written a review before but i feel the need to issue this warning: another reviewer said that the singer had an accent and really, the german is so bad it is almost impossible to understand. there is no way a child will learn german from this cd. it is actually quite shocking- i'm not sure what the producers of the cd were thinking, they entirely missed the point. the music itself is highly unoriginal and cloying too. sincerely wish i could return this one."
1,Horrible - Finger weg!,"Thankfully, everyone has a chance now to listen to most CD's online before making an actual purchase. I was searching for a gift for my little niece to help her learn my native language German.I am SHOCKED, that this is even on the market! This country has so many native speakers available, why did they choose a singer who obviously has no clue about what they are singing? The accent is so bad, I could not even identify the words at times. People wonder why most Americans do not speak other languages. Well, we have found the answer. With the embarrassing learning material available, no one would be able to learn a language properly!"
4,A great resource for starting out with qualitative research.,"Seidman's book is clear, thorough, and thoughtful. I thought it provided a great introduction to doing in-depth interviews and turning those interviews into useful qualitative data."
4,Kitty,"Kitty, the main character has many issues to resolve in order to survive. The loss of her mother and baby are just two. Great story of the usual love, betrayal and redemption."
4,My thoughts,"Many books have been written on the subject of grief and loss and the discovery of long hidden family secrets. It takes a skilled author, though, and Clare Morrall is one of those, to make us care very much. Kitty is a woman who in almost every sense has not grown up; she is forced to deal with some of the toughest things life has to offer. Towards the end, as she is teetering on the brink of insanity and then eventually falls into the abyss, we are not mad, we are not fed up with her shenanigans, we have grown to love her and want the best for her. We want her to whole-heartedly accept the love her husband has for her instead of settling for living across the hall from him.This is a tragic, beautiful and subtle book from a talented writer. I will be reading anything else she writes."
4,One of the best books I've read in a long time.,"We watch as Kitty, the main character's, life spirals out of control and we hold our breath as her diminishing mental state hits bottom. This book was so compelling. Kitty had an unusual, sad and lonely childhood; her mother died when she was three and she grew up with a distant father and distant older brothers. There are many color references in the book, her life is filled with color and intermittently void of color, the author used vivid (or stark) color references that really work. Kitty and her husband live in adjacent apartments, his is all white and immaculate, hers is bright and messy.There are several surprises in the book that left me shaking my head, not in disbelief, but at the turn of events. I will be watching anxiously for another book by Clare Morrall."
1,Pathetic knock off of Super Chexx,"This game is a SAD imitation version of ICE's Super Chexx. If you're looking for a Super Chexx type game, do yourself a favor and save up the money for a SUPER CHEXX! This game is poorly made and just doesn't appear durable. Flimsy construction and poor gameplay.Not worth $100 let alone $900. Sadly disappointed in the one that I checked out."
2,"Product is Great, but Linvobit/Amazon service is TERRIBLE","This is a terrific product, but Buyer Beware: Lingovbit has provided bogus contact information to Amazon, and even Linvobit's own website does not have valid contact information--the email addresses are all bogus. If you have any sort of problem, Amazon will tell you to contact the seller directly, even though Amazon took your money, and then you will learn that Lingvobit is impossible to contact. Amazon will then tell you again that you need to deal with the seller, and will not contact them on your behalf when you tell them you cannot find a way to do so yourself. I loved the first one I ordered, and was ordering one for a friend, who then changed her mind 10 minutes after I ordered it. All attempts to cancel it failed, and now I will have to wait literally WEEKS for my refund... plus, I will have to pay to ship the thing back... I would find another source for this otherwise excellent product..."
4,Baby loved it!,My son loved to be carried around in this! It is a little ackward in the baby facing outward position. But for the money and the back support! I think it is AWESOME! It was refered to us by a friend that managed a ... store!
1,"Hated ours, never used it","This is one of those items that everybody registers for because everyone says that you must have one. We found ours to be really useless. You aren't supposed to use it, even with the baby facing you, until the baby is 4 months old and able to hold their head up. By that time, they are getting heavy enough that they aren't really that comfortable to wear around this way for long periods. My other mom friends who I walk with all stopped using it by about 6 months and switched to backpacks or jogging strollers. Our baby hated being ""trapped"" in it; we found a Maya wrap to be much easier to use and much more comfortable for him and for us. This has too many buttons/latches/adjustments and was a pain to get on and off and get the baby into/out of. I think we used it a total of three times. At this price, not worth it."
4,Great product for babies under 20 pounds,"When my baby was first born, my husband and I took him everywhere in our Baby Bjorn. We've used it so much so that ours is pretty much worn out and the shoulder pads are flat. Even though the feature says its good for babies upto 33 lbs., I found that carrying my baby when he was just a bit over 20 lbs., around one, was very straining to my shoulder blades and lower back. I was only able to sustain it for less than 10 minutes. And because he's got a good size belly, he was cramped and looked very uncomfortable even when the carrier is at its largest."
5,100 Stars! BabyBjorn is the best baby front-carrier!,"This carrier may cost a little more than others, but it is worth every penny. I tried all of the other brands out in the store with my 3 month old. She protested all of them but LOVED BabyBjorn. I found this one to be the most comfortable too. I use this carrier every day with her. If you have a baby that likes to be held all the time, this product is a must. I can't say enough good things about it!"
3,Hands free? To do what????,"Although the carrier is very comfortable for periods of 45 minutes or less, I find I only use it for walking or shopping. I can't sit with it on because my baby hates getting her legs squished. I can't do any chores that require bending for the same reason, plus having to brace her head with one hand is awkward while trying to get work done. I tried vacuuming once which worked until I hit her head on the vacuum cleaner while trying to do the stairs!Still, I couldn't live without this item, but I don't use it as much as I wish I could."
5,Buy it!,"You'll love it. My husband especially likes it because he feels he's ""getting a workout"". Our baby enjoyed this carrier much more than the Sling carrier by Snugli. He is secure and safe. As he got older, he loved looking out at the world. Easy to use, easy to clean, great product. No need to even shop around."
5,The reviews don't lie!,"The Bjorn is really the best carrier we have found. I had requested the Graco 3 in 1 on my registry and in the meantime tried two others with no luck(both were handed down thankfully) My mother-in-law called and asked if I had read these online reviews and that Graco didn't do so well either. After reading quite a few it was evident the Bjorn was the favorite. I was hesitant about the price. Now I say it is well worth yours or your mother-in-laws money! I used it once and my 2 month old and I fell in love. Very easy, comfortable, and yes my baby hardly knew he was being put in and taken out. And stylish too. Where I live there is lots to see and do and a stroller just holds you back. I can't wait for many more adventures with the Bjorn carrier."
2,Breastfeeding Moms Beware!,"At first, I thought this carrier was great. Being carried so closely seemed to soothe the baby and even make her fall asleep when it wasn't even close to naptime. And it was great to have two free hands when she was still awake. But breastfeeding moms beware! If you wear the carrier for more than 10-15 minutes, you may get plugged ducts which are extremely painful and can lead to infection. My baby only weighs 10 pounds and the minimum recommended weight for the carrier is 8 pounds. THe pressure that those straps put on the chest can cause these plugged ducts. I've tried repositioning the straps so that one falls outside my chest and the other in between. Didn't work. I'd return this expensive carrier if I could but I threw out the packaging! Luckily, dads won't have such a problem!"
5,A MUST HAVE Baby Item,"This was by far the best item that I got for my baby - who is now one, and still fits in the carrier (she's 20lbs.). My baby was not a big stroller lover, so when she got fussy and I still had things to do, I would just put her in the carrier, and away we went - happy as could be. It worked great at Disneyworld in places where you couldn't take a stroller and had to stand in a long line! It is expensive, but it's durable and if you plan on having more than one child, it will last - and still be stylish. Once you get the hang of putting it on, and adjust the straps to your liking, it's easy to use all by yourself. Love it, love it, love it!!!"
5,Worth the money,"I love this carrier we tried all the others it seems like. This one is easy to do by yourself, it's comfortable and you and take it off after baby falls asleep and not wake the baby. I love it because you can nurse while walking or doing other things with ease and some privacy. Very handy if you have a toddler and newborn. Worth every penny!!!!"
5,Worth every penny!,"I purchased the bjorn carrier after hearing other moms tell how much they loved it. I have tried other carriers. The last one I tried was also a disaster - way too hard to use! I ended up in tears trying to figure out how to put it on in the mall parking lot! After having our second child (who is colicky) I splurged on the bjorn and am quite thankful I did! My little guy ""lives"" in it! I do my housework, cook, even play with my toddler while keeping my infant snug! It's VERY easy to take on and off - which I prefer to do while breastfeeding - although you are supposed to be able to do this while keeping it on as well. I would highly recommend every mom purchasing this one - especially if you are planning on more than one child - I wish I had bought this one first and had it for both kids!"
2,Now I know better,"I received this as a gift when I had my first daughter. I couldn't wait to put her inside and carry her around. The fact was, it was too heavy for my back, to bulky of a carrier and too difficult to put on. I used it no more than FIVE times! Another mom at my new mother's support group had her baby in a new native baby sling/pouch. That is wonderful! I am now pregnant with my second and that is what I will get. It is half the price and twice as practical! I wish I would have known, I feel bad that my girlfriend spent so much money!!!!"
1,Try One Out Before Buying It!,"I heard NOTHING BUT GOOD things about the Baby Bjorn, so I did not think twice about registering for it, despite the steep price tag. I was lucky enough to receive one as a gift. However, my little sweetie never did take to being in it. She wiggled, fussed, and eventually screamed. Since sharing my story with others in different Mommies' groups, I have found quite a lot of people who did not have positive experiences with carriers either...I am not blaming the product or its design; I just think some babies enjoy being in there while others do not. My advice is to try one out before spending any money on it."
2,Not what I expected,I have ordered these bags before and the ones I received are different. The first bags were a type of fabric and these are just paper. They didn't even come in a sealed plastic bag. They were just lose in a manilla envelope. Therse are smaller too. I just hope they work ok
2,What the heck?,"I ordered Kenmore Canister Type C 50558 bags for my vacuum. That's what the outside package said, but when I opened it that is NOT what was inside. I received Style RR bags for an upright vacuum. The seller of this product may not be to blame because the package is correct, but I still received the wrong product when it was opened. Do I want to keep ordering something that may or may not be what I ordered? Amazon's policy is that you can return unopened, like new products only. Well, the only way to know that the order was incorrect was to open the package.....what's a girl to do?"
5,Great,Could not believe how low they were priced. Great quality and would most likley buy again. They had a tape on each bag so when it's full you can just tape up the hole and throw
1,Doesn't mach,It does not mach the vacuum it said it would. I bought as a combo with the vacuum bags but they shouldn't offer it as a match and the vacuum's model should be specified on the name + on description of the product so mistakes like this could be avoided.
5,Why was I paying more before?,"We are just getting over a flea problem in our house and needed to change our bags daily. You can imagine that we didn't want to use expensive bags, but certainly did not want cheap bags that ripped or were too loose. These bags are cheaper and fit our vacuum perfectly. We just wish we had learned about them before!"
5,Cheaper and just as good,"After reading the reviews on this website, I decided to go with these bags instead of the Kenmore originals. These are much less expensive, and just as good."
1,Very Poorly Made - waste of money,These bags are very poorly made. The flange that attaches to the bag and allows you to slip it into the vacuum cleaner is attached to the bag is a haphazard manner. Most of the bags had this flange glued on so that the bag would tear when inserted into the holder in the vacuum. Thus rendering the bag defective. I won't by these bags again. In the end I didn't save any money since I had to throw out 4 bags since they ripped open.
2,Not what I thought,"Like everyone else, I want to save money, and from the reviews, I thought these bags were the way to go. But I'm returning these bags without trying them for two reasons. First, because I have lung problems and must have good filtration, and I don't think these bags will provide it because they look flimsy compared to the ""real"" bags. Second, I don't appreciate this company's attempt to avoid labeling these bags ""made in China,"" which they are. The bag says, ""Designed and Developed in the USA. Manufactured in P.R.O.C."" P.R.O.C. is ""People's Republic of China."" Why not just say so? Probably because ""made in China"" makes you wonder if the product is actually safe."
4,read my mind,"Some how, I ordered this product, and the next day (with normal shipping) it was at my door. Literally THE NEXT DAY! It was like they had read my mind."
3,Microfiltration??,Bought theses for the price was hoping they would fit my small cannister shop vaccum. Had to modify the vaccum with a craft foam piece not exactly a tight fit so the microfiltration is not efficient. Which does not matter anyway because when the vaccum is turned on the extreme air flow blows the dust all over. This seems to me to be a design flaw in most vaccums these days as the air flow seem to be where you are trying to vaccum.
5,Fit prefect,Fit both my Kenmore canister vacuums perfectly. I saved at least three time what it would have cost for even the generic ones at Wal-mart. Great buy!
5,It eats dirt,"Good little bags. Work just like they should. Not only just like it should, butno doubt just like all the other bags available out there. How the heck wouldone write a flowery review on a vacuum bag?"
1,Not Kenmore Q bag,"Warning, the second image shows it's a Kenmore Q bag. NOT TRUE. the product delivered is th eone shows in image 1, it's a Kenmore C bag. Do not buy if you are looking for Kenmore Q bag"
4,Just a question...,"Why did this company started to change the packege content of 10 - and sell now only 9 bags for the same price.Yes,we all know why,and it is still a good deal.But it was better with 10 in the bag,right?"
5,Kenmore Vacuum bags,"Item just as described, quick shipping, no problems. Thank you! Its great to use Amazon to acquire superior products for less money. Thank you again!"
4,Kenmore Bags,"These bags were a bit more bulky than I was looking for. However, the price was good and they worked fine. Arrived promptly."
2,No suction power,"These bags are not only smaller, but also do not give adequate suction power after some use, even when the bags are far from full (maybe less than a quarter of its capacity). I think that the original Kenmore bags work several times longer and better than this brand. I'll go back and buy sears Kenmore bags again."
3,Good Bags,"Good basic bags for our Kenmore Canister Vac. Good value, and they arrived earlier than originally projected thru standard USPS mail."
4,Great Value,"I can't tell you how much these vacuum bags have helped out. My son was diagnosed with asthma and the first thing the doctor suggested was microfiltration bags and to vacuum when he was not in the same room...its made a huge difference to his quality of breathing. Secondly, the brand name bags are way too expensive for my budget. The Envirocare are probably the cheapest on the market and actually work"
1,B&M Housewares - bad business practices,"B&M Housewares is advertising EnviroCare bags for Kenmore Canister vacs 5055, but is shipping a very low end Dust Vacuum Corp (DVC) bag. They are not microfilter, they are not even as large as the standard bag. Total Bait and Switch. Shame on you BM."
1,Does not fit correctly!,"Note there are multiple listings claiming to be the same product, but it's not clear if they are all the same or not. Depending on who you get this from (there are several Amazon listings) the price varies from about $6 to $10. The one I got looks exactly the same as pictured (from Envirocare), but came from B and M Housewares. The bags do not fit correctly. The cardboard frame is the correct size, but they glued the bad to the frame too close to the edge (about 1/4"" instead of 1/2"") so the bags bunch and tear when you install them. Also, the bag itself is very thin and rips easily."
5,Pretty good substitute,"I was a little uneasy ordering sight unseen. No regrets now. I have had no problems with the cardboard ""connection"" being glued to the bag and preventing its use. The bag is indeed a little smaller than the name brand. But as another review noted, they fit into the canister better. They work as well as the expensive ones. Value for money is indeed 5 stars."
5,very satisfactory,"these disposable bags appear to be just as well made as the name brand bags that cost much more, so buy with confidence."
3,Basic dirt bag,It's a good bag for the buck. We were tired of paying out the wazoo for those HEPA jobs that really did not seem to make a difference anyway. So far were happy w/ these at more than half the price of the HEPA bags.
5,Love these!!,Great vacuum bags at a price you can't beat! I have a Kenmore canister and these bags fit better than the ones bought from Sears because they are a little smaller. They are also slightly thinner than the Sears bags but NOT fabric like as some have described. They are also the same type used by my vacuum repairman and he swears by them.
5,Great product,Great stuff. Same as product that is in the store. But much lower price. ThanksThese bags fit perfectly. No problem.
1,Fake Bluegrass,"This CD is not a bluegrass recording. ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"" and ""The Marine Hymn"" with a background of some picking, ect does not make a bluegrass recording. Shame on someone."
3,Double Shot,"Having read all of the Goldy Bear Catering mysteries I was starting to tire of carrying the baggage of The Jerk into each new story line. Finally! Can't tell you what happens of course but you will be pleased. The only downside was that it took the whole book to finally be rid of him.There was also more ""language"" in this book than usual.Tom, Arch, Julian & Marla are such rich personalities that story lines should be endless. Why not borrow from Charlie Chan and take a family cruise or a trip to New York or wherever? People do get murdered outside of Colorado. :>)The recipes are once again outstanding. No disappointment there.I'm not giving up on Goldy but I do hope the next book is better."
5,DEATH TO THE JERK,"Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy Schulz series had started to become uninspired and tedious; with DOUBLE SHOT Davidson gives us her best Goldy in years. Boldly bumping off one of the series' pivotal characters (the despicable JERK, Goldy and Marla's ex), the novel moves with interesting characterizations and plot developments and allows Goldy to move in some different directions. Of course, Goldy is the chief suspect in her ex's murder, and it's only through her valiant sleuthing that the culprit(s) responsible are exposed.Stuffed with tasty recipes as usual, DOUBLE SHOT is an intriguing blend of whodunit, whytheydidit and will they get caught? The identity of the murderer is well hidden, and the ending opens the door for more exciting future endeavors. Praise to Davidson for saving her mostly engaging series."
4,Serving up Red Herrings,"This is the first Diane Mott Davidson book I've listened to. The audio is well done by Barbara Rosenblat, whose style is a little dry, with only subtle voice changes between the characters. The author cooks up some amazing food and several red herrings throughout the book. If you like a dise of food with your mysteries, this will be a good series to choose."
4,How does she drink so much espresso?,"Double Shot is another wild ride with everyone's favorite detective caterer, Goldy Bear Schultz. Goldy is as a good a cook as she is nosy. The espresso-chugging, yoga-practicing caterer finds herself suspected of murder, of her black-hearted, devastatingly handsome ex-husband. A lively, fun read for those days you just want to escape. Diane Mott Davidson serves it up well."
1,This was AWFUL !!!,"I hope the recipes turn out to be good because the rest of it was garbage; ridiculous plot, unlikely characters doing unbelievable and preposterous things! I can ,at least, understand why there are so many typos. . .I doubt that even a paid proof-reader could wade through this drek with focused attention! Don't buy it!"
4,Series Back On Track,"This series had really gone downhill lately, mainly because the character of Arch had become unbearable. However, the author must've finally realized how overboard she was going with him, and with him toned down in this book, it was a much more enjoyable read.The Jerk is gone. Hallelujah! That was another thing that was getting tiring -- that Goldy would allow her ex-husband to continue to harass her, and that her cop husband wouldn't do something about it. With this thorn now gone, there seems to be much more potential for the characters.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I felt there were just too many characters to keep track of. Good for red herrings, bad for continuity.Looking forward to the next installment...and hoping the author doesn't slide backwards."
4,Back on track,"I was concerned after ""Chopping Spree"" as that story seemed to be all over the place and it appeared the Goldy Bear series might be seriously bogged down, but with this newest edition, it seems to be back on track. The only reason I give this one 4 stars instead of 5 is the problem that seems to plague all series of this type - the fact that murder just seems to follow the heroine around unrelentingly. Still, this book is fun and I don't think the series will suffer from the absence of The Jerk. He was getting pretty annoying anyway. Ms. Davidson leaves us with a somewhat unresolved storyline that will bring new interest to subsequent books."
5,Another great from a favorite author,This book was just as great as her others and her recipes are always fun to try and delicious as well. I am anxiously awaiting her next book. Diane Mott Davidson and her Goldy Bear Mysteries are always a great way to relax and enjoy a warm spring day....my favorite way to enjoy the beginning of spring.
3,'Bout Time!,"Yea!!!! The jerk is dead. What an unlikable character who is so revolting. As I was reading the book I was wondering when she was going to kill off the Jerk. Two pages later I had my answer. Sort of twisted and unbelievable way that he died but I have come to accept the author's methods and enjoy them. Now Goldy should slap Arch around a few hundred times and then maybe he will start to not acting like a spoiled unlikable brat. Okay maybe not slap him around, just shake him.Also, see my review on Catering to Nobody for further explanations about my reviews."
2,The Cat Who Dropped a Bombshell,"I've actually read 15 - 20 of these books ... I can't believe how bored I was listening to this one -- I didn't care for the story, I really didn't like the reader, and this audio book was definitely not up to the caliber Ms. Braun's previous books"
3,Words for Words' Sake,"Wolfe tells his coming of age story with extensive, descriptive passages that sometimes get in the way of the plot and the reader's ability to actually develop an attraction to the characters themselves. With Wolfe, it seems to be more about the thrill of putting words together than actually telling a story."
5,An Honest Appeal to the Hearts of All Viewers,"Remember when one of your school assignments was to ask your parents what they were doing when John F. Kennedy was assasinated? Well, bring that up to date and see what some Americans were doing when ""9/11"" became an indelible imprint in our minds, seeing the towers fall. You will hear the honest (and very real) expressions from people across the US; you will cry when they cry; you may agree or even disagree with their views. But one thing is for sure: you will admit that this documentary captures the essence of being human and suffering loss. You won't be disappointed in the poignant reflections..."
5,Do yourself a favor and read this book.,"I think this is the best Murder, She Wrote book out there and I've read just about all of them. I can't come up with any complaints regarding this book. The setting was great, the charactors, and the plot itself was outstanding. It was hard to put the book down once I started to read it. It will be difficult for Fletcher & Bain to make a better story."
4,Great Book,"Jessica is off to the beautiful US Virgin Islands to get away from a harsh Maine winter. She checks into her hotel owned by old friends called Lovers Lagoon, which is being run out of buisness by another hotel next door. One night when Jessica is walking on the beach she discovers the body of one of the owners. Jessica does some checking in to the murder, and finds out something shady has been going on at the hotel. This is one of my favorite Murder She Wrote books I've read. The plot though is very similar to the book Murder At The Powderhorn Ranch, that's why I gave it a 4 star"
4,Murder at Lover Lagoon's Inn,"This is the first book I read in the ""Murder, She Wrote"" series. Jessica Fletcher, the main character in the story is off to Lover Lagoon for a vacation. She knew the owners and were on good terms with them. It was one night when she was taking a walk at Lover Lagoon when she discovered the body of one of the owners,Walter Marschalk. She was determinded to find out the murderer. Walter's previous job was a famous travel writer and so Jessica accept the invitation of the owner of rival inn, Diamond Reef, to have dinner with a group of travel writers. She found out that Walter was not well-liked among his friends. As the story goes on, Jessica found a lot of suspects and discovered a lot of unexpected things. I find the story moveing on a bit too slow and the ending is also abrupt. But overall it is a nice book."
4,Excellent resource,"This book was my primary study guide for the 70-298 exam. (IT'S BEEN SAID A MILLION TIMES BEFORE "" DO NOT RELY ON ONE STUDY GUIDE"")Although the DVD sucked, the book provided a great tool for studying. The layout of the book was amazing. The chapters were broken down to cover the objectives of he Microsoft exam, and included hands-on labs for you to grab the concepts of the chapter.The quizzes found at the end of the chapters, test your comprehension of what was covered in the chapter, not what is on the MS exam.I gave it 4 stars because the CD sucked."
3,Ultimate League Collection...Sort Of,"Okay, so here is the fifth ""Best of"" compilation for The Human League. Did we need another? No, not really. But this is the one to get if you're a fan of great sounding synth pop. Or if you've just been waiting forever for some Human League remixes on CD. All the tracks are digitally remastered (Mirror Man has never sounded better!). The bonus disc has some pretty interesting remixes, although most are really ""dub"" versions that don't include most of the lyrics. My only complaint (again) is the omission of ""The Things That Dreams Are Made Of"" on CD1(there is a new remix on CD2)and the inclusion of the boring version of ""Being Boiled"". The version on the Travelogue album is much better. See also HUMAN LEAGUE DVD."
3,Excellent Disc One! Redundant Disc Two! Overpriced as a Result!,"Disc One of this cd is a very good best of compilation and you should get the one-disc version remastered that's out there. The price here is very high and you're getting a ""bonus disc"" that you pay a premium for but is really not worth it. In fact, if anything, the bonus disc actually makes the overall package worse! If you like the Human League and want to get the best they've ever done just get disc one of this and ""Dare"" and you pretty much have the best that the Human League have ever done."
3,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this book. I have read several books by this author and loved them, but in this one, she takes most of the space psychologically dissecting every movement Pres. Johnson made or didn't make. Her opinions need not have entered so heavily into her work. In between all this, there is some interesting information about Pres. Johnson that sheds light on his thinking, as he, himself, expressed it. If you have a lot of patience, it is worth reading."
4,"Men, read this!","This is a must read for all men, the younger you are when you read this, the happier you will be. This book helped me to reflect on my own life and articulate more clearly to myself and my wife the importance of our sex life. Men are taught early own that sex is all about pleasure and gratification. With this limited view, we are often left wanting more and more, never feeling satisfied."
2,Everything is your fault . . .,". . . if you are a man. While this book is well-written and does have some wisdom in it, there is a ton of condemnation for men. Sex is boring? Must be the guy's fault! Wife having an affair? Must be because of her husband! Etc. Every single example of maritial strife from this book, that I can remember, shows the man in a bad light. Piling completely unnecessary guilt on guys who are reading to try to find ""kosher"" ways to improve their sex lives at home is really kicking them while they're down. I have read four of Schmuley's books and very much enjoyed two of them. This one went into the trash before I had finished reading it."
1,Disappointing -- read Dr. Ruth's book instead,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found numerous inaccuracies, both in the author's descriptions of religious teachings and in information about sexual practices. In some cases (such as his chapter on BDSM), he begins with a completely wrong assumption about *why* people practice BDSM and what they get out of it, and then bases all his judgement on those false precepts. I found many points in which he was out-and-out wrong.If you're interested in the subject, Dr. Ruth Westheimer's book ""Heavenly Sex: Sexuality in the Jewish Tradition"" is a much better book -- more accurate and more interesting."
3,doesn't discuss oral sex,"informative, but not in depth enough, nor give enough stats on how average couples perform."
1,utter hypocrisy (as if we are surprised!),"The rabbi's pose is transparently hypocritical because Judaism's ""holiest"" book, the Talmud, teaches misogyny, the fundamental ""orthodox"" Judaic doctrine about women:""Though a woman be as a pitcher full of filth and her mouth be full of blood, yet all speed after her."" ---Talmud, Shabbat 152band also, ""...a man may do whatever he pleases with his wife at intercourse: Meat which comes from the abbatoir may be eaten salted, roasted, cooked or seethed; so with fish from the fishmonger.... A woman came before Rab and complained [of her husband's sodomy with her], ""Rabbi replied: 'Wherein does it differ from fish?"" ---Talmud, Nedarim 20b, Soncino edition, p.58"
1,The Epitome of Ignorance !!!!!,"Bible believers have been known to conform to pretty strange religious teachings but the thought of having sex in a manner that must be pleasing to God has got to be the biggest pile of tripe I have ever come across. What makes Shmuley Boteach thinks he knows what god likes when one is in the thralls of passion?????Never mind what your partner likes, as long as the great Peeping Tom in the sky is not turned on then the act is a no-no. ....... How utterly ridiculous??!!Readers, as long as the parties involved are consenting adults acting in privacy and it feels good....... DO IT!!!!Shmuley Boteach should try it some time"
4,good dust pan,"It's a very large pan that looks to be well constructed. It's sturdy and works pretty well. The rubber strip along the front doesn't always seal to the floor, so it will take more effort at times, to get all the dust. The extra large size can be a detriment at times, because you can't get it into the smaller places, but that's a minor issue. All in all, I'm quite pleased with it. It doesn't twist or flex and seems like it will last a long time with daily shop use."
2,Whatch out! Do not believe the hype,"It is ambitious and there is not much that is directly wrong on this book, but it clearly lacks the depth and scope that it is being touted as having. The leading sitcom producers just offers soundbites and the practical foundation for the books teachings is weak.."
1,BIG problems,I have had this for a little over a year and it failed. It started making clicking noises. When I googled this I found out I was not alone. LOTS of people have trouble with these drives - they are very unreliable. I recently bought another one and am now scared that I will lose the data on that drive. DONT buy a MY BOOK!!!!
2,pretty bad product,"the reason that i give 2 stars instead of 1 star is because that it is still able to keep my data-- the hd isnt failing. BUT, i really do not like this EHD, because it is really unreliable to transfer big files. from time to time,usually within 10 mins, it will automatically shut off while i'm accessing files in it. then i just shake it, it comes back on. i hope other people will not have this problem, it gets really annoying. plus, there are so many reviews about high failure rate about WD's high capacity EHDs, so i will not recommend this to others."
5,Solid performer,Very nice unit. Recommended.Pro: Relativly quite. File corruption is usually concern with externals (especially DIY external enclosures) but not this one. Auto on/off feature keeps unit in sync with pc.Con: I like the 5 year warrenty of the Seagates; I wish more drive mfgs would follow suite. Only concern regarding 400GB is the price. As of 12/2006 you can get the 500GB for the same price as the 400GB. I got mine at St@ples for $99 Thanksgiving day sale.
4,Mathematical Archeaology?,"This movie is deep in its math. It is also incredibly intriguing. It may even be right. I am not wise enough to know. But the premise is simple: The earth has had at least one more advanced global civilization before us. The evidence? The mathematics that are inherent in the structures of the many of the great historical pyramids. Such as the pyramids in Giza, and in the Andes and so on. As for 'how' this movie was done? It is far from interesting. It is essentially a video tape (that was converted to DVD) of Carl Munck speaking with a whiteboard. If you are not strongly intellectual, or incredibly interested in the subject matter, the movie itself will do nothing to help you stay interested. There is not a single graphic, or otherwise. Its a lecture, with a white board. REALLY.Otherwise, if you are open to alternative explanations for things on Earth, this could be very interesting, and who knows, maybe even true.I would love to 'chat' with anyone that has seen this movie."
3,"Not the best Alkaline Boosting product I've used, but ok","I was actually hyped into trying this product, from their sales materials, which included a pretty well done CD recording. I'm totally on the acid/alkaline bandwagon, but I can't say I'm totally on the Buffer pH bandwagon. I felt SOME benefit from using it, but not nearly as much of an alkaline boost as things like Alkaline Water, Coral Calcium, Ionic Minerals.... the proven alkaline boosters. This Vaxa formula is a blend of some pretty unique ingredients, including some homeopathic stuff I've never used before, and know little to nothing about.I wouldn't use this as a stand-alone alkaline boosting product. I'd definitely use it in conjunction with alkaline water, green juice, and coral calcium."
5,A good way to achieve pH balance,"I learned about pH balance a while back and did some research. I discovered that because of our diets, most of us walk around with high acidic levels. One of the consequences of this is that it is very difficult to lose weight(among other possible health troubles).So I looked around and decided to give this product a try. This is a homeopathic product which is veggie based and free of gluten(it has been gentle on my system with no side effects). I've been taking this for a month and got some nice results from it.Since taking this product, I've been able to lose about 6 lbs and feel more balanced in my body. Once our pH levels is balanced, it is important to remember to adjust our diets and eat plenty of fruits and leafy greens(and lower our intake of meats and processed foods)."
2,No visible Benefits,"I am about 80% done with the bottle. I have been taking 4-6 tabs a day as directed. I measure my pH daily, morning and evening. I also try to follow a program of eating alkaline producing foods. The challenge is to get the morning pH up to at least 6.5. I am still having difficulty seeing pH above 5 or 5.5 in the morning.I'll finish off the bottle and may update this review but for the moment I am not satisfied. I don't think it is a VAXA problem specifically, as I have tried another brand with no results. It is hard to say whether the whole concept of trying to become more alkaline is not soundly based, or the means to do it are faulty.Update on Nov 16....I finished the first bottle and have no further recommendation. It is hard to imagine how a small amount of powder can defeat all the acid in a stomach."
4,Vaxa Buffer PH,I really like the product. It seems to help with over-acidity in my system and would recommend this product to anyone who has GERD.
2,Don't waste your money,"Not at all happy with this purchase, I can't honestly say it did anything, this was money I could have used on something else :("
1,buffered vaxa vitamis,"first it took forever to get and then the vitamin capsules at least so far i found 4 empty capsules, maybe they broke inside the bottle, think because there is some powder on the other capsules that come out. that is not acceptable."
5,Brazilian superstar sings in Italian,"This is an early album (from 1969) by Brazilian superstar songwriter Chico Buarque. He and his family lived in Italy when he was a boy, and he is fluent in Italian, so this album is much better than you might imagine. A hidden gem in Buarque's back catalog. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
3,"Great screen, slow speed","This is my first laptop purchase and I am somewhat diappointed with the speed of the 900MHZ Duron processor. My 400MHZ desktop is MUCH faster. The screen is bright and large (15""). I am extremely frustrated witht the Windows XP OS...what a joke! Don't count on using Netscape, the mail settings are lost with each reboot. I believe I would spend the extra ... for a Pentium or Athlon to speed things up. Instant access buttons would be nice as well such as dvd controls or internet quck start. No hardware problems, however."
3,For completists,"Casual fans: before you pay an arm and a leg for this out-of-print disc, a warning. Six of the tracks on this CD are recycled from the Everlys' 1983 REUNION CONCERT at the Royal Albert Hall. The other tracks run the gamut from inspired to rote, and really present nothing that isn't available elsewhere in similar versions.Unless you NEED TO OWN EVERYTHING THE EVERLY BROTHERS EVER RECORDED, I'd skip this one, especially if you have to pay close to a hundred bucks for it."
4,HP Pavilion E PC,"An excellent lap top, I use for work, as a free lance translator, for movie creation and fun, and pretend to pass it over to may nephew very soon."
5,Great value,"I paid ...and am getting a ...rebate + a software package that includes Corel Draw and office 2k. I find this to be a bargain.I am pleased with the AMD processor's performance, and XP seems to be really stable by current standards. And it has the DVD and the writer(not to mention 10 levels of blasterball!).I was comparing for weeks before the buy, and found that this one gives the most bang for the buck."
2,Cheap Quality,"I bought this set when I got married, 3 years ago. I have to say that I'm really disppointed. I don't even cook everyday (don't tell my husband) and one lid's vent is not working properly and another is loose.And I haven't started to talk about the handles. In the picture the handles look sturdy but they are hollow, the silver piece at the top can come apart and the only way to put it back is to superglue it. All the handles are woobly already.I washed the pans in the top rack of my dishwasher which shouldn't have been an issue since it clearly state they are dishwasher safe."
2,OVERALL QUALITY,"The lids are the most disappointing part of this set. After normal use from washing and handling of the lid knob, they permanently start to become loose and fall off. I don't think it is repairable so the lid knobs probably has to be replaced/ordered new. The other problem that had me rating item so low is that the handle become loose after normal use, and my attempt to repair/tighten the screw on the handles is unsuccessful. The handle still remains wobbling a bit....especially on the pot with the 2 handles."
4,A great book and an impressive woman.,"Kay Macpherson, born in Britain and trained as a physiotherapist, devoted most of her life to working with women and for women. An international figure, she was most active in Canada. In the fight for peace, she fought governments and the armaments industry. She was president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, lobbying for government action on a Royal Commission Report. She campaigned for office as a feminist and a socialist. She served as a Director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. When invited to address the UN, she had to fight to be allowed into the USA. Known for her unbounded energy, the title accurately describes her style. Her anecdotes serve as a ""who's who"" of women leaders, in numerous causes and most continents. Above all they illustrate the strength of humour which sustained women who took on entrenched (and frequently arrogant) power."
1,Awful.,"This video belongs on YouTube. It's that short and poorly done. It is made at home with extremely basic computer and camera work, and Becky has no script, and no gift for speaking without one. This video MIGHT be worth it if it cost a dollar, but is a total and complete rip-off for $30. It was awful. I'm sorry to have to say it, because I'm sure Becky knows what she's doing and is a very nice lady, but she has no business making instructional videos and selling them for the amount of money that would lead one to believe it's a high-quality production packed with excellent information. It is neither! DON'T BUY!!!"
2,Doesn't quite work,"I bought this feeder thinking it would deter the house sparrow and house finches. While it does keep house sparrows away, the house finches still manage to feed from it. Worse of all, some of them stick the upper part of their body into the opening and just perch there while they go through the seeds, leaving shells behind in the feeder! I have yet to see the smaller birds feed from it."
4,Satellite Bird Feeder ---suggestions,We have used these very attractive and efficient feeders for many years. Since we use hulled sunflower seeds there is some white dust which accumulates on the interior surfaces. After several years the white dust clings tenaciously. The steel screws meanwhile rust making their removal for cleaning difficult or impossible. I have ordered two new units and will replace the screws with four stainless steel screws and nuts in the new units when they arrive.
1,poorly made,"We have had these feeders for years. I ordered one for my husband for Xmas. The top cap was buckled in two places. I sent it back and got a replacement, same thing. I called the manufacture of these ""Duncraft"" and they checked and they are all like that. I felt rain could get in these places and cause the seeds to clog up. So the second one was returned as well. Too bad, they are a perfect feeder for smaller birds. Hopefully this flaw will be corrected."
5,One of the Best,"Mine has been in service for 3 years. Pros: neat, durable, inexpensive, and clinging birds like my neighborhood's chickadees, nuthatches, hairy woodpeckers, and titmice visit it regularly with little interference. Doesn't allow leisurely grazing so it doesn't get emptied quickly, and therefore is only used by house finches and house sparrows in a pinch during intermittent, lean times of the year. Strung from a long enough chain, the squirrels are now leaving it alone. Cons: Not entirely waterproof, squirrelproof, or house sparrow-proof; lucite looks a bit dull after a few years, must be taken apart to be cleaned well, and to date is not cardinal-friendly. Compared to my $80 roller-style feeder that squirrels destroyed in a year and other costly failures, this feeder's clearly the winner."
2,"Call it ""Christmas at the Cohens"" -- Only One Hanukka Song!!","This compilation could be much cooler -- if it lived up to it's name. Instead, there is only one Hanukka song on the whole thing -- which is very weak if you ask this 1/2Christian 1/2 JewWay to be LAZY, whomever put this comp. together is lame and didn't do their homework -- there are plenty of great Jewish songs to cover, and plenty of Jewish Indie-Rock people to cover them -- ask Ben Kweller to name a few!"
2,Where's Bright Eyes,"As a fellow fan i was very dissapointed to find that there was no ""Blue Christmas"" to be found under the cohens christmas tree."
1,Disappointing,"As much as I like The O.C., this album is pretty pathetic. As others have said, it is short at 28 minutes long, although that wouldn't be an issue if most of the music on this were any good...I don't know much about Hannukkah, but this CD contains the WORST version of Rock of Ages I have ever heard, the guy can't sing and barely plays. Christmas is Going to the Dogs is amusing, The Raveonettes song is fun, and the 2nd song, which is an 1980s cover, is good if you are in the mood for that kind of thing. And I did enjoy the Long Winters song. All in all, I would say listen to the samples, and then download the ones you like from itunes, it's just not worth it to get the whole album."
4,Charming holiday cd.,"Okay,at a mere 28 minutes long,this album is easy to criticize.However,that excepted,this is still a good album.It's charming and conjures up happy holiday thoughts.I think it's worth it just for the song ""Maybe this Christmas""."
2,Bah hohumbug,"With the exception of Jimmy Eat World's ""Last Christmas"", which is quite fun, this album is pretty boring."
3,Watch out for sound synch problem!,"There is a small but noticeable sound synching problem in the first half hour of the movie. I wouldn't say it ruins the movie, but it seems like an inexcusable mistake in a release of this magnitude. This was probably the most eagerly awaited DVD of the year other than the upcoming Godfather set. With any luck, a corrected version will be released."
4,Just one drawback - and it's a big one...,"This is a very well-produced DVD edition. It's beautifully packaged, the picture and sound quality are quite good. But the film itself is divided onto two discs. Considering the amount of information you can fit on one disc, why did the producers make this choice ? Perhaps a lesson could have been taken from the Gladiator DVD - put all the extras on Disc 2 and leave the film untouched.Apart from that one ( in my opinion ) bad choice, this is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection. This film has dozens of reasons to be appreciated. And for the price, you really can't go wrong."
5,Just the best film ever.,A wonderfully restored version of one of the best and most beautiful films ever. No computer enhancement here just spectacular photography and breath taking performances. The best film ever. They don't make them like this any more.
5,Lawrence of Arabia on DVD.,"The long-awaited DVD version of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is finally here; and it is not a diappointment. Crammed with special features & stylish packaging, this is a purchase best not passed over. The classic epic about one man's triumphant journey through the Arabian Penninsula during World War I is not just a story, but a cultural and historic landmark in filmaking. The movie, loosely based on T.E. Lawrence's ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" catches the essence of the book's magic as best a three-hour movie can about the escapades of a junior officer in the British Army whose ingenuity and courage lend catalyst to the Arabic revolt against the Turkish. The cinematography, soundtrack, and acting come together in choreographed perfection to create a marvel of sight, sound, and magic. This movie truly represents the pinnacle of Hollywood's moviemaking, and on DVD, it looks better than it has in years."
5,Absolutely fantastic.,"The words needed to properly describe the grandeur, the flat-out SIZE of this film have simply not yet been coined. Sorry.Buy the movie and mayhaps you can come up with some of your own.I give it a 67 out of 5. Need a better review? Read Lawrence's biography by J. Wilson. In a month you will either be ready to cement-over the Sahara or buy the movie. My hopes are with the latter. =)"
5,"Wonderful visuals, wonderful score.","This movie has one of the best original scores in the history of cinema. The wide screen shots of the desert are amazing. Truly an epic, worthy of Homer. Ironic, I suppose, considering T.E. Lawrence went on to write a translation of The Oddysey(under the pseudonym T.E. Shaw)."
5,The greatest movie in history,"THE milestone in film history, comparable in glory only with ""Gone with the wind"", ""Doctor Jhivago"", ""Titanic"" or ""The English Patient"". Peter O'Toole gives here his live time performance (together with ""Becket"" and the ""Night of the Generals""."
5,An Epic For The Ages,"A masterpiece.The performances are remarkable,the cinematography is the best you will ever see,the gorgeous scenery and costumes,and that amazing musical score by Maurice Jarre.Then there is David Lean the genius behind this masterpiece, He has made many great epics, but Lawrence will always be the jewel in his crown.I own both regular & widescreen versions Please, to really appreciate this film buy widescreen it makes a major difference.Of course to really appreciate Lawrence, see it in a theatre.Whichever way you choose any true lover of great film's should not miss what is truly, the greatest epic ever."
3,Showing its age.,"This movie is undeniably a classic. But did they have to play the same music over and over again?And why 2 discs?The story, if we could make the fiction from the truth, would be interesting. Unfortunately, I am not much of an history buff.So, it is a good epic. Epic being the key word."
5,"Why hasn't the GREATEST EPIC BEEN ""BLU-RAYED/7.1 AUDIO""","Ask any DIRECTOR since 1962 to compare any of his/her work to ""LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"" with STRICTLY ""THROUGH THE LENS CINEMATOGRAPHY"" and they will(or should be SILENT!)I consider this masterpiece,the BEST EPIC FILM of the last 75 years.It's NOT RACIST....it's a slice of BRITISH/ARAB history!(with some HOLLYWOOD EMBELLISHMENT).I know Steven Spielberg would agree with me.I JUST CAN'T WAIT for the BLU-RAY release done right.{maximize film aspect ratio to current HD television ratio,YELLOW ENGLISH SUBTITLES and NEW 7.1 DTS-MASTER audio.PLEASE COLUMBIA/SONY,MAKE THIS SO.....I want this sooner than later!I own the 2000 version in STANDARD DVD.If ever there was a film to EXPLOIT the BLU-RAY hoopla,this is it!Also REAR WINDOW(blu-ray and 5.1 surround)but that's another studio(UNIVERSAL).WIREWIZ5"
5,"Experiencing Lawrence Of Arabia DVD on a new 37"" TV","Our 2002 JVC recently bit the dust(went DARK)and we upgraded to a 37"" Olevia (Best Buy from Consumer reports). We tried our new ""Lawrence"" DVD and were stunned to see the difference in picture quality, sound and brightness. The desert vistas were breathtaking and it was like being there - - - with a regular DVD.This picture and the music are as good as they get. A monumental achievement!"
4,Mostly satisfied,"Just got the latest 55"" flat screen so of course I had to have one of the all-time classics. Have been purchasing old/quality movies from Amazon for 4 yrs. After watching this 2 disc set (which is good), I realize that I need to invest a little more and step up to Blu Ray (player and available BR DVDs) because I am that picky. If you are new to this movie, then the collectors edition is probably just fine."
5,A River To The DVD Format,"Movie Summary: British officer T.E. Lawrence is balmy. He is sent out to be a military observer to Prince Feisal of Arabia in World War 1 and ends up leading the Arab revolt against the Turks. He does the impossible a few times along the way by uniting the warring Arab tribes and taking Aqaba. In the end he becomes a legend.My Opinion: Both the movie and the DVD are 5 stars. The story is so engaging that it was over far faster than it's 227 minutes would suggest. This is a movie that passes the test of time. It is a wonderful work of art.DVD Quality: This is an awesome two DVD set. It's wide screen anamorphic with a remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. There are way too many extras to list.What You Should Do: Buy this DVD. Rent it first if you have doubts, but you will not regret buying it. This is what DVD was meant to be."
5,"First-rate all the way: script, acting, and photography.",This remains the only film I have ever seen that truly captures the incredible desert beauty of the Middle East while telling a story of duplicity and cynicism that laid the foundation for the turmoil and hatred that still burdens that region. Peter O'Toole's protrayal of T.E. Lawrence is the best work he has ever done. The film is quite simply a classic.
5,Easily one of the greatest films of all time...,"Sadly, we may never again see its like, given the types of films made today. The incredible attack on Aqaba is like actually watching history unfold. An amazing achievement. And the writing is first rate. It's really hard to get any better: the script is literate, profound, and sometimes devastating. Part 1 is probably better than Part 2, but it's hard to quibble here, not with the amazing cinematography and scenery, the timeless score, the star-making performance of Peter O'Toole, and the rest of the stellar cast. I believe the AFI ranked it as their number 3 film of all time, and it's not hard to see why."
5,LAWRENCE OF A LABIA is the anti AVATAR,if you've paused here to read this than you already know what i'm talking about . this film as well as AVATAR is filmaking on an epic scale . sans computers . i don't need to compare and contrast these two films . you'll either agree or not approximately a paragraph ago . LEAN was the man .
2,"Fantastic movie, horrible DVD","Everyone should know this is a fantastic movie in every way. And nothing brings it to the screen better than Superbit. But why, tell me why o why, would they cut the movie in the middle of a scene, so close to intermission? The movie is spread onto 2 DVDs, and instead of cuttting at intermission, a perfect time to interupt the movie, they do it a little before. This interrupts a beutiful viewing of a fantastic movie, and without reason."
3,Lawrence of Arabia,"I haven't yet totally viewed, but it was L O N G getting to the actual picture and seemed in good condition."
4,See written review!,"The DVD starts off playing the theme song but it is blacked out. Why is that? It then starts with the Columbia sign and proceeds to the film. If that is the way the film is suppose to start out then I wiil keep it, but if it is not then I would like a replacement."
1,Not here yet.,"It's one month now and it's not here yet. I should feel frustrated, but I'm not.I'm hoping they'll resolve my problem and the Blu-ray will be soon."
5,Lawrence of Arabia,"A classic, based on a true story. Exceptionally well filmed, great performances. Quite a long movie, but just set aside some extra time and settle down and enjoy! One of the all-time greats."
1,"Five stars for the film, one star for the presentation","I bought this DVD as a way to show off my new DVD player to my family. I had seen the movie several times in the theater, and knew its bright colors would be beautiful on my TV screen.To my horror, I saw that Columbia had seen fit to alter a masterpiece. Yes, the film came complete with those horrific black bars at the top and bottom of my screen, which obscured about half of the picture. I've seen those bars on the ""artsy"" videos on TV, and I sometimes enjoy them. But this is a classic work of art! You don't try to make it ""hip"" and ""relevant"" with modern touches. It would be like adding a moustache to the Mona Lisa.Until Columbia drops the act and releases ""Lawrence of Arabia"" without those bars, letting us see all of the picture, stay away."
5,A classic among classics.,"I consider this film, along with Seven Samurai, to be my favorite movie of all time. Nothing needs to be said, buy it, watch it. Now.... Go... What are you waiting for?David Lean directed this masterpiece and the film world doesn't give him nearly enough credit for it."
4,Excellent,"Excellent casting in this tale of war in the middle east during world war 1. Delves into the arab psyche as well as delivering the tale of a man who dared to differ from his own race and class, and find a temporary home among the arabs. Strangely prophetic in ways, as the arabs seek a homeland amidst british duplicity. A great movie for a dark cold night."
5,Great movie.,"I saw this movie when it originally came out, on a super wide screen. What a thrilling experience. The newly remastered version on blue-ray is tremendous. Great color, excellent sound score. This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves a place in one's collection."
5,"Fantastic film, wonderful BD release","The film is breathtaking and the performances are brilliant. David Lean (""Bride on the River Kwai"", ""Dr. Zhivago"") directs from a script by Robert Bolt (""A Man for All Seasons"") As with any historical film, one can quibble with the accuracy of this or that, but T.E. Lawrence was already being mythologized in his own lifetime, so any portrayal is bound to be controversial. Lowell Thomas's reporting and lecture tour made Lawrence and international celebrity while he was still in the field fighting the Turks, and his own autobiographical writings both added to the legend and deepened the mystery, of this contradictory, brilliant and maddening figure.The Blu Ray disc looks and sounds gorgeous and the extras are very nice. The only thing I could wish for that is not here is a commentary from Lean himself, but that was not to be."
4,There's no spanish subtitles!,The quality is just amazing!Probably it was my mistake but I suppossed there were spanish subtitles on this one. that's why I put only 4 stars.Otherwise it deserves 5 stars!Peter O'toole was marvelous here!
4,DVD transfer,"For the most part, the transfer was excellant. The wide angle shots in the desert showed vertical stripes in the blue sky that looked like the film was flickering by. Would have been nice if they had had a better print to transfer to DVD. The story itself is fascinating, Lawrence the man, the people involved, the local politics, the international politics."
5,Poor History - Great Filmmaking,"For historians, David Lean's remarkable film fails to accurately tell the story of this enigmatic figure and that's just the way T.E. Lawrence would have wanted it. Lawrence is portrayed as military cartographer seemingly out of touch with the region when, in reality, while still in his late teens he embarked on a dangerous journey, traveling the region for an entire year, risking life and limb.So, why 5 stars?As a film it's superb cinematic art. A rousing story, exotic locations beautifully lensed with an exceptional cast headed by a star-making performance by Peter O'Toole. David Lean was a master at the top of his game when he made 'Lawrence' and managed to meld a sprawling epic with a highly personal drama. This is the kind of film that was made for the Blu-ray format which preserves the richness and depth of the original 70mm image."
5,"Very long, but far from boring","Yeah. Real movies, real backgrounds, real actors...in case you're wondering what any of those three are like, check out this movie. It's incredible. Don't be intimidated by it's length, there is an intermission, a great place to take a break, and since the movie takes place over a few different time periods, it's pretty easy to take breaks between certain chapters. Not only is it an aweseom look at Lawrence, but it is also a fine look into WWI era history to see what was going on back then."
5,Magnificant performances in a wonderous land...,"First released in 1962, and restored some 27 years later, this slightly longer version of the movie is a must see on the big screen - if only for the epic vision of the director, David Lean. A youthful Peter O'Toole takes the central role of T.E. Lawrence, a man who managed to unite several Arab tribes in defiance of the attacking Ottoman Turks in the First World War. This is no simple biopic, however. Lawrence of Arabia is a massive picture in every sense of the word, with Lean utilising the vast expanses of the desert in a way no other director had, or indeed has, since. If you haven't seen it before, there is no excuse. If you have, there's still no excuse."
1,"Single-disc edition: Excellent movie, bad encoding...","Amazon's rating engine is stupid, stupid, stupid. I've added this rating for the single-disc edition of Lawrence of Arabia, but the review appears for all versions of the movie. So let me clarify: my single star has nothing to do with the quality of Lawrence of Arabia; it's one of my favorite movies. I purchased the single disc edition and found that my DVD player couldn't decode the content from chapter 52 on. This is because the content had to be so heavily compressed to fit on a single DVD that ... it just didn't work. I know it's an additional $20 for the dual-disc version of this film, but, since the single-disc edition doesn't work in the first place, if you're going to buy Lawrence of Arabia, you'll find the additional money worthwhile."
5,See this film in theatres if at all possible.,Undeniably the most spectacular and emotional theatrical experience you will ever encounter.
3,"Sand, Sand, Sand","Sand and camels and sand and camels and sand and a horse and, ooh, something happened but I missed it, go back to sleep, dream of sand and camels and sand and camels."
2,"Epic yes, Great movie... well no.","I can not understand all the gushing over this movie. After seeing Bridge On The River Kwai, I was expecting this to be more in that vain. Gallant British troops overcoming great odds, led by a brave commander named Lawrence. What I got was a 4 hour bore fest of how a somewhat unstable man rose to the rank of Colonel. Give me Gunga Din or Zulu over this any day. On the plus side, Columbia / TriStar has done a great job on releasing this DVD. The print is in excellent condition, and the extras are many. But, like I mentioned, this isn't a movie to have many repeat viewings."
2,"Sorry people, I guess I'm just too dumb to get it.","I have been viewing this film every few years since it first came out. I figured my initial boredom with the interminal sand scenes was my due to my youth and inexperience; but I can now honestly say: I don't like this movie. It just dra-a-a-ags. And I have quite a tolerance for slowly-paced movies. I like Peter O'Toole and really like Omar Sharif. So there you go. I honestly don't understand what the big ""thang"" is about this movie.I heard that this movie took forever to film and that Peter O'Toole went through all kinds of identity problems while filming it. Those facts are more captivating to me than this long piece of work. I guess I just don't get it."
3,hmmmmmmmmm,"Okay now I admire this movie's cinematography, the acting, the directing and the grand desert scenes. But doesn't anyone else find it...well....a tad boring? I mean, it's very slow and the plot drags along. A bit of a bore, I'd say. Sorry to all the devotees."
2,"Larry and the Inferior, Primitive Arabs","There is one ugly idea that permeates this movie; The Magical Caucasian leads the stupid, primitive Arabs. It's a distasteful, racist undercurrent that reflects the early '60s American thought structure. It doesn't matter how great the acting, cinematography, etc. are, any great movie's story HAS to be mature and convey a breakout from this kind of backward relationship."
1,Wiundows Strikes Again,"This film is maybe the greatest motion picture ever made. But if you don't have WINDOWS software, you can't watch this DVD. Be careful, nowhere in the information provided can you learn this."
3,On and on and on......,"Well, I finally sat down to watch this movie and was expecting a great epic. Great? Hardly. Mediocre at best. Peter O'Toole's acting was so-so, in fact the whole movie was so-so. And if they had removed those looooong ""crossing the desert"" scenes, which were so boring that the characters even kept falling asleep on their camels, the whole movie would have been under 90 minutes. How much sand do we have to look at in three hours and 30 minutes??? Truthfully, I'm sorry I bought it. Should have just watched in on Turner Classics, cause I'll never watch it again. But at least now I can say I saw it. WooHoo!"
5,David Lean's Masterpiece,"David Lean, we all know him from""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". But Lawrence of Arabia is his best movie. Lawrence played by Peter O'Toole is a British Officer who serves in Arabia. The Britsh are in war with the Turks. The Arbians are helping them, Lawrence gathers all the Arabian Tribes together to fight the Turks and he wants the independance of Arabia. What follows is a 4 hour during view on the life of this man. You shall lover the dessert and you will love the wonderful music of Maurice Jarré. The movie has a stars-cast with Omar Sharif, Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn. What's very strange on the movie is, that there are no women in speaking roles."
3,Epic,it is a great epic movie - I don't know if I would watch it again as I found it depressing. But beautifully made.
5,The best movie ever made,"I have seen this movie on the big screen, vhs, and now dvd. Of course, nothing compares to the big screen experience, but if you have a decent sized television and surround sound, the dvd experience is the next best thing. I really can't add much to what is already known about this movie, but I will say that Peter O'Toole is the most glorious actor in the history of motion pictures. That performance has never been matched, not even by O'Toole himself. And as far as David Lean is concerned, he was at his peak as a director. How much more can one accomplish after making a masterpiece? I love this movie every time I see it, especially when campared to so called epics like ""Gladiator"" with it's muddied color and wooden acting. By the dvd version and you'll have many hours to enjoy this wonderful film. The scenery is simply stupendous and all the other actors are almost as good as O'Toole. Buy it!!"
5,A masterpiece that has to be seen,"This movie has everything in it but romance. It simply doesn't need it, because the other elements that make movies great are all there. It would not be fair to reproduce this movie (along with many others), in todays age, digital recreation can only bring the illusion of what once was the true Hollywood. Cleopatra, Gone with the Wind, Spartacus, and many other movies, were made the real way, real actors, and real movie sets."
2,Boring!,"This movie was so slow I could not finish it. I can not see what critics see in this film or how it made it to be the fifth best on AFI's list. This film has no women at all. Interesting beginning, though."
1,A Terrible Distortion of A Man's Life,"first saw ""Lawrence"" when I was a boy growing up in the 1960's. I assumed it was, more or less, a truthful account of a man's life. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is a beautiful movie, but it has very little to do with T. E. Lawrence. The screen writers had their own political agendas and basically invented most of the scenes in the movie. I mean they made major errors and omissions in the film, didn't even get the geography correct. From a historical point of view, piece of junk. Check out this link from the T. E...The problem is that people will remember the fiction of the movie and not really see the reality of the man. This is a pity.[...]"
2,Lawrence of Arabia,This film is way too long. It could easily be cut in half. The extra length makes it quite boring. The acting in it is excellent but the length of the film is colossal. I saw it in the theatre when it was revived about 20 years ago. So I saw it in the best of circumstances not on video on my TV. But I still found it boring. One of the most boring films I have ever watched. Sorry.
2,Boring in Arabia,"Undeniably, the most boring film, other than Quest for Fire, that I have ever sat through. I know it has a loyal following and it's eluded me as to why. A terrific cast, wasted in the wasteland. For 3+ hours we see the camels lope across the desert this way, and then back the other way. It was painful to watch such beautiful scenery and great talent stagnating in a celluloid farce."
5,Great value,Film and background provided on the DVD was of the highest quality.Wil recomended this DVD to my friends and relatives.
5,Classic,"One of my favorites, this film has it all. It is legendary cinema and simply must be seen by anyone who claims to love movies. Take an afternoon, though, because this is four hours long."
5,The Most Beautiful Film Ever Created,"This movie is worth seeing for the cinematography alone. The music is also spectacular. The best part of the movie, however, is the acting. The interaction between Lawrence (O'Toole) and Ali (Omar Sharif) is nothing short of mesmerizing. It becomes clear in later scenes that they are meant to be opposites: Lawrence is slightly feminine, pale, blond, flamboyant, and a political schemer. Ali is dark, intense, angry, and while he is also beautiful (In my opinion, one of the most gorgeous men in history) it is a much more masculine type of beauty. Whenever Lawrence is falling apart, Ali is completely in control, getting everyone through the crisis. Even their clothes are opposites. Lawrence wears flowing white robes, while Ali is always in head-to-toe black. Watching those two brilliant actors play off one another in such a gorgeous movie-there is no other film like it. I would not alter a single scene. Perfect."
5,"Great story, great actors","This is certainly one of the movies that I would call art. Perfect story, great actors. It belogns to me in the category of Cleopatra, Ben Hur and Gladiator. For a long rainy afternoon exactly the right thing. And always entertaining again. I like exspecially the added scened that are not available on the standard DVDs or VHS formats"
4,Good Old Movie,"A good, not great old movie, to long, could have made it shorter, was better on a 70mm screen, a little lost on a 52"" screen. Worth watching again. not on my best 25 list"
4,Raised my blood pressure: gave me a bloody nose!,"When I first saw this a lot of it went right over my head!I saw the Young Indian Jones about how the Arabs were treated at the treaty meeting in France.The Germans fought the first world war basically because the British and French were backing them into a corner.The British Empire despite all the history we get was just not a real niceway to treat other people?T. E. Lawrence was in this movie a pawn of the British used to get Arabterrorists to attack the Turkish troops. No one can say that the Turks were nice, just they were civilization in the Islamic sense.But oil was a new motive and the middle east was an important part of the future that the British Empire needed.Saying that the fellow Lawrence was used and ultimately abusedby the process may well be a simplification.My opinion is that he may have been abused by this movie( after the fact). But the movie also made historyand brought a new way to look at historical figures in film."
3,For very large widescreen TV only,I think that half of the enjoyment of this film is missed as it is shown on TV. The beautiful desert landscape where the most part of it takes place is impaired by the size of TV screen where it is turned in an ordinary film. I think it doesn't work suitably out of the cinema screen.
2,Faulty Disc,There is a glitch in the disc itself- chapter 28 cuts off. I have played the movie in another player and it did the same thing.
1,Don't bother buying it.,"Alright, well, I saw this Manga in my library and I thought I'd borrow it, to read it and boarden my horizans of different genres because I'm a Shonen Ai and Yaoi Fan.This book was rated 13 TEEN and let me tell you, if you think this is a cute little kiddy story it's not! Not only is it [...], featuring a woman with [...], girls showing their [...] in almost every shot they can get away with, there's almost no plot too. It isn't even funny, just increiably stupid.It's trully is a horrid Manga. If your a fan of Bishonen, stay away from this one! There is none and no Yaoi!"
2,A Great Start,The first 30 minutes of Total Reality are great. Big spaceships thunder across the screen (and your speakers) whilst being attacked by lots of smaller ones. In the meantime an attack force boards one of the biggies and lots of shooting occurs whilst the battle rages outside. It's great stuff and gets your adrenalin going. But it's a real shame the film didn't hold my interest afterwards. The goodies are forced to go back in time to track down the baddies who also went back in time. Some quite exciting set pieces (with big explosions) keep the excitement going but then melodrama and some pretty poor acting start to take their toll. I know this isn't a mega-budget film but you don't need big bucks to keep the pace going. The film slowly starts to run out of steam. What a shame. But it's definitely worth seeing if you like space battles and there is another BIG spaceship at the end.
1,Oh dear...,"This truly and utterly stinks. Awful acting (I thought Keanu Reeves was wooden, but this is a whole forest of Z-list actors), abysmal plot (not only could this atrocity be written on a beer-mat, but you'd have space to write two more of these stinkers in the space left over).Avoid!"
4,"great cans, but not with an LG phone.","The sound quality from the MM50 headphones is wonderful, especially considering the source is just an mp3 player embedded in a cell phone. Unfortunatly I have to pull out the headphone jack one 'click' in order to hear full stereo sound. This is annoying, but it also means that the mic and push to talk functions are rendered useless, which is almost a deal breaker. According the the side of the box these work best with Motorola phones. My LG is out of luck for compatabily. That said, the sound quality alone is good enough to justify the price and the hassle of use, so I will keep them. Highly recommended for you Motorola users out there."
3,Watch for compatibility,"I have a Cingular 8125 PocketPC/Phone which is actually a rebadged HTC Wizard. The phones which come with it are awful and these looked to be pretty good. However, I have just returned my second pair as only the right channel works with the phone; I initially assumed a fault with the headphones, but given the second pair behaved exacly the same I assume I have a compatibility issue. It's a shame, because the sound out of the right channel was so much better than that from those included with the phone."
4,pretty much ok,"I got one headset and discovered that one speaker sounds different than the other.Then I got a replacement which was totally different to the first set. It was louder and the bass was played much better. Overall nice quality for both, speakers and mic."
5,Ron Keel's Iron Horse,"This is one of the best albums from begining to end that I have heard in years. Former 80's metal singer turned country is now back with a mix of music that is nothing less than ""Hard Rockin' Southern Country Metal"" I can't stop listening to this album and I have owned it since it was a demo version."
1,this album sucks!,Amazon has this album labeled wrong. this is not the blue grass band but some never been el-suck-o band. made me want to puke trying to listen to it. a total waste of hard earned cash
1,This one is simply outdated...,"I thought this book, since it was published in 1999, would have some current information. Unfortunately this book has only information for a total beginner. The pictures in this book are of technicians in the early to mid 60's working with equipment and cars of the same era. (you would think when a book got ""updated"" they would update the pictures as well as the text.). The technology and materials are WAY out of date. Avoid this one..."
4,Good for beginners,"I am a beginning painter so this book was perfect for me. It is all the basics of quality a fine paint job. If you have never painted a car before like me when I got this book, then it is a good book to read."
2,"Nice sound, poor quality","I bought this CD player about 2 years ago as a replacement for my 10 year old Pioneer single CD player. I have enjoyed the 6 CD capacity, but most of all I was impressed by the improvement in sound quality. It has a warm, full, almost analog sound, but before long it began skipping and having frequent dropouts. No matter how much I clean the lens, the inside of the unit, or my discs, it skips far too often, and I'm again shopping for something else."
3,Diamonds are Dack Rambo's friends,"In RIVER OF DIAMONDS, mining engineer John Tregard (Rambo) travels to an island off the coast of West Africa where the reefs are encrusted with precious stones. It's said that Mercury Island is cursed, for all who dare go there DIE. An elderly adventurer named Shelbourne (Mayne) is determined to keep Tregard from locating the island's underground diamond stream. In his search for treasure, Tregard encounters deadly snakes, rotting corpses and more!As of 1/09, ""River of Diamonds"" was not available on DVD.Also recommended:Dack Rambo was a member of the all-star cast featured in Jerry Lewis's silly war comedy,WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT?(VHS only)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(6.1) River of Diamonds (S Africa/W Germany-1990) - Dack Rambo/Angela O'Neill/Ferdy Mayne/Graham Clark/David Sherwood/Tony Caprari/Dominique Tweya"
5,Wow does this book help!!!,I think I have seen and suffered from a common form of Spiritual Abuse as defined in this book. Group Think not God Think. Church leaders wanting to do what they would like and not what God wants as stated clearly in the Bible. If you point it out you are told in many various ways to shut up or move on. Where is God in that? This book is helping me deal with a situation and has even helped explain my reactions to the situation as predictable from thier research and experiences. Thank you for your work and God's hand in it!
5,Should Be Required Reading For Every Christian,"Awesome. Clear. Concise. Precise. No confusion in this book. Only pure, clean, uncut truth about forms of abuse, how to regognize them, how to avoid them, and how to escape from abusive systems and relationships. This book also helps perpetrators of abuse to recognize their destrective behavior, and STOP. This book should be required reading not only for every Christian, but also for every person, religious or not, in any leadership position as it will help such persons to stay focused on their duty to treat every other human being as a person of equal value."
5,Set Me Free,"This is excellent and right on target if you have ever been in spiritual abuse. It has released me, to be free from the bondage of this kind of abuse!"
5,"Very good , helpful and informational.","I have read and purchased several copies of this book as I, myself was in a spiritually abusive church. I would say this book rates at 10 because it is accurate and very helpful to abuse victims because it helps them see that they are not the only ones and also the fact that it ""is"" abuse. For people that were raised in this type of system, it can help them to understand what is happening to them. I really appreciate the authors who wrote this book and have given these books to others to help set them free. Wanda Mason"
5,Something all of Jehovah's Witnesses should read,"This was the first book that was recommended to me after I came across all kinds of information on the internet about the Watchtower Society and was looking for answers. My husband and I both left the Jehovah's Witnesses after being deep in it for 10 years. The subtle power of spiritual abuse, indeed!!! We were completely blinded all those years. Not anymore. This is an excellent book to get started with. I thank God for it."
4,really good,"this is a really good book on a hard subject. I also recommend ""when bad christians happen to good people."""
4,All the Hits Plus More,"Joe Fagin has a unique style that is warm, experienced and classic. The songs on this CD work perfectly with his voice.If you were in college in the 1960's or early '70's, you willfeel quite at home with his mellow rock magic."
2,One song missing,"We watch ""As Time Goes Buy"" which is an English sitcom that includes the song of the same name. We researched and found that it was Joe Fagin who was singing the sound track. Unfortunately, the names of the songs were not listed on the website so we bought it in hopes that it would be there. Alas, it was not. The CD is Ok but really wanted that song!"
1,back with the boys again?,"hmmm this was a let down. i really can't comprehend why ol fagin made an all the best album when there aren't any ""best"". if this cd was called all the gay, it might be ok. BUT NOT! Fagin is at his worst here and this cd will make you cry, if your lucky enough to not have your ears bleed. May this cd die."
1,Wine picnic stake set,"I already reviewed this. The style I received was nothing close to what was pictured on Amazon and has since been updated after contacting the seller. I didn't like them at all. I won't return them because of the expense. I was going to give them as christmas gifts, but I won't."
1,Failing after 180 hours...,"Happy with the order/process on the front end and initial quality was OK, but giving lamp failure error after 180 hours. Can't seem to get a response from seller, very frustrating... In reading through other reviews, sounds like this product is being dramatically misrepresented as new/OEM replacement when it isn't. Time to take some legal or better business bureau action? Amazon - have always been a fan, why are you letting this happen?!Follow-up, ordered again and this time came from Amazon directly, NOT Crawford Superstore. Was an OEM lamp, Crawford Superstore was clearly attempting to sell knock-off lamps as if they were OEM. And now not supporting take the piece of junk back."
1,Bright but unreliable,"Mine was bright and stable, until it started flickering a little over a year after I got it. It only had 250 out of a specified life of 2000 hours on it, but since it was out of warranty--which is based on time since purchase rather than hours powered on--I was just out $350 with no recourse. I've never had a lamp fail so early into its life without any support from the manufacturer."
4,Dead at 2000 hours,"Original lasted 2500hrs. Off-market brand lasted 50hrs. (Ugh). This replacement lasted 2000hrs. No noticeable dimming, no flickering. Sure, I wish it would have lasted a little longer, and I really wish it was cheaper, but it works as advertised. However, instead of purchasing again, this time around I am going to try a bare lamp replacement at 1/4 of the cost. Bare lamps can easily be inserted into the housing of this or your original bulb unit."
1,Scam,Beware this is not a name brand lamp. It is a refurbished knock-off. Had to learn hard way after it totally fried my projector and this company won't do anything about it. Don't buy
1,Lamp broke within a month,I used this as a replacement lamp for about a month and it looked great. Now it does not work at all and the seller does not respond to any communication from me.
1,Warning: Old Lamp being sold as New,"FRAUD!!!I ordered the Panasonic Lamp for my ET-LAX100 through Amazon about 3 months ago. The name of the vendor was ""wholelampshop."" I was very happy because I got a really good deal on the lamp. After the lamp arrived, I did not use it immediately because the old lamp was still working although the Replace Lamp indicator was going on. Finally, when the old lamp stopped working, I opened the new box and replaced it with the new one.To my shock, the ""Replace Lamp"" indicator came on. I checked the settings on the number of hours on the new lamp, and was utterly shocked to see that it indicated that this supposedly ""new"" lamp had already been used for 3001 hours. After about 10 mins of use, the lamp stopped working.I have contacted the vendor, and am still waiting to hear back.Has anyone dealt with this vendor before?Thanks,Pankaj"
3,A tough read...,"There seem to be two distinct writing styles in this book. One is overly formal, using eclectic jargon that nobody but a scholar in this field would understand; one is laid back and frivolous - almost too conversational.Although the book has some good ideas and suggests useful paradigms, it is very difficult to read. However, the friend who recommended this book to me because of my autistic granddaughter swears by it.Like any ""textbook"" some will get a lot out of it, others, like me, won't."
5,Well worth the money,"Many people tried to steer me away from this machine because of Windows XP, and because of the service convenience that comes with other top price brands. I went with this one anyways and could not be happier. It has more bells and whistles than I have been able to figure out yet, and performs like a champ. Very, very satisfied!"
5,Cool!!!,"This movie is great!!!I loved all the sonic movies, but this one is the best of them all!!!!!!!You gotta get it!!!!"
1,I just couldn't stand to hear the whole CD! Yikes!,"A complete waste of money. I couldn't stand to listen to this woman's voice any longer, it was BAD! The singer is probably a good opera singer, but children's music is definetly not her thing! The real kicker, however, is that she is obviously NOT a native speaker. The Elmo bilingual CD is much, much better! Not a happy bilingual mom!"
1,"""how to speak Spanish like a gringo""","I'm a native English speaker, but I lived overseas in Spanish-speaking countries from ages 10 to 16. My accent isn't native, but it's passible. The accent in these songs isn't terrible, but it's quite bad... nowhere near something native. If you're trying to teach your kids Spanish, you might as well teach them to pronounce things correctly! Why TEACH a bad accent deliberately? Usually people have bad accents because it's unavoidable if you pick up a language after age 12 or so, but if you're starting with younger kids, why go for a ""gringo"" accent if you can avoid it?"
1,Horrible Spanish,"I called the company to tell them how horrible this product is and they didn't even call me back. It is sitting on my desk hoping they call so I can ship it back to them at my expense along with a note about how horrible the translation is. I bought the French one as well and I imagine that the same lady who sings in both is just as bad in French. As many of the native speakers have noted in other reviews, the translation is a big problem in this CD. All of us who heard this CD in my home cringe when we hear how bad it is. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Ridiculous!,"I am kicking myself for not reading reviews before buying this CD. I am fairly fluent in Spanish and want my kids to learn. I listened to the first couple songs on this CD and I couldn't help thinking that this could be a Saturday Night Live skit. The way this woman tries to stuff sloppy Spanish tranlations of English-language children's songs into the same rhythm of the English original is nothing short of comical and totally unhelpful to my kids. The phrases are rushed and garbled. I can barely pick out the Spanish words myself! My I recommend instead the brilliant CD called ""El Doble de Amigos"" by Sol y Canto. And, after you see how much better that one is, please help me find Sol y Canto and convince them to produce a follow-up children's album!"
3,"Readable, and a good guide to what else to read","This was a barely average book from a readers stand point. The story of the life of Simon Bolivar was quite interesting, but the author seemed bound and determined to sedate this excitable tale down to a sleepy murmur. The index was poorly done, and the book lacked anything in the way of personal writing of the principle, or anything from his intimates. It also had a notably sophomoric feel, and for a biography of such a looming historical figure I find that unacceptable."
1,"Sterotypical, not very creative","Why do you you insist on portraying all Visitors as wide-eyed peace-loving simpletons? This book is amusing in many ways (like, what is a CPA and why would a CPA write a book about something she clearly has made up?). Nonetheless, this type of liberal ""why can't we be friends"" propoganda merely assures that your planet is destined for destruction. Why is it that you earth-dwellers will be the only ones surprised by that event?"
3,Organizational Communication by Gary L. Krepes,The book is average in terms of condition. It is still look pretty good eventhough It has some highlights all over.
4,Book delivered on time,It was the book I needed for an upcoming trip and was delivered in good condition and well before I needed it. Thanks much.
4,"if you like Neal Stephenson historical fiction, you'll love the ending to the Baroque Cycle","if you like Neal Stephenson historical fiction, you'll love the ending to the Baroque Cycle. If you don't like long winded rambling, don't buy this."
2,Missing Jacket,"The book itself is in OK shape, and I knew it was used, so I expected less than pristine. But I didn't expect it would not have a dust jacket or wrap or whatever you call it. I thought it would look like the picture as shown. I don't know how I am supposed to know it does not include the jacket; I cerrtainly did not see anything in the description that says ""No Jacket included."" I would not have purchased this book had I known."
5,System of the World,"I am in the process of reading this book. It is the last book of the Baroque Cycle trilogy, so I am familiar with Neal Stephenson's writing. Seldom have I encountered a writer with such a depth of understanding of philosophy, breadth of knowledge(both technical and historical), writing ability and humor. In the Baroque Cycle Stephenson puts you in the Baroque world and drags you through its grit, dirt and genious. He brings it all to life with grace and skill. This is NOT pulp fiction!Hal Cronkhite"
3,long .... so long ..... need..... editor.....,Finished ... book ... three..............Tired ....so .... so .... tired ......My.....kingdom....for....an....editor..........
3,Too sprawling,"I am a huge fan of Stephenson's earlier books and started the Baroque Cycle with great hopes. While all of Stephenson's books require a bit of dilligence to get through due to their intricate descriptions and complex plots, I have always felt that the payoff at the end of the books was enormously satisfying. In the case of the Baroque Cycle however, I felt that ultimately what should have been two great books was stretched (or more to the point, not edited tightly enough) into three books. There are elements of the plot in the System of the World which are entirely new to trilogy and these come at the expense of existing characters and story line which are left somewhat abruptly or unsatisfyingly. I feel that there was so much about this period that Stephenson wanted to describe and write about that he ultimately lost sight of the cohesiveness of the story."
4,Great Fun for the doorstop fiction set,"This is the third volume in Stephenson's ambitious and fun recounting of the world events circa the late 18th century. This has got the birth of the royal society, the growing pains of international trade and the intrigues at Versailles for starters. This volume is tying up a number of lose ends, and focuses more on the Royal Society and Versailles then on the swashbuckling adventurers that take up a lot of space in volume two. It's good fun, especially if you have any interest in doorstop historical fiction."
5,I can't wait to see what Neal Stephenson does next!,"I'll keep the review short, since the book is so long: read this book. Or rather, read the trilogy. It requires the reader to work a bit, but it's well worth it. Some parts are beautiful, some hilarious (I think I spotted at least two Monty Python references), and some just fascinating (although I could have done with fewer London geography lessons). My favorite of the three books was the second, which had the most excellent adventures of Jack Shaftoe. Next fave was book one. So this one was third place. But still. Loved it."
3,Go2China Ultimate Chinese,I think I got a lot for my money (only available second hand and quite cheap). But I found some of it obsolete. The set-up program ruined my XP OS Professional. Had to reboot and restore. Running the last part by itself worked. Found this trick out by Google (many thanks to someone). The Go2China web-site seems to be down. There is a lot of work here by the authors. I hope I can make it work.
3,Citizen Coors,Discussions on the Business aspects of the Coors saga was what interested me the most. Found the story lines on Joe Coors' politics to be dull. I skipped some of these sub-sections. Was facsinated with all the facts and details regarding the family's story and its focus on engineering and technology.
3,JUST HIS MUSIC,"This album is presented as it should be Herbert Rehbein and his orchestra, but it isn't.The music is performed by italian musicians.Flugelhorn solo: Sergio FanniGuitar solo: Claudio BazzariViolin solo: Sergey d'CyskaAll sinthesizers: Aldo BanfiPiano/Fender: Oscar RocchiAll guitars: Claudio BazzariBass: Paola DonnarummaDrums: Flaviano CuffariChoir: The Voices of MilanoStrings: Solisti Scala/Angelicum Milano"
4,Disappointed,"This collection of Rehbein's songs doesn't begin to compare to his other CD's, ie, Music To Soothe That Tiger."
1,where is the first step?,"This is not a step by step book; it was designed as reference type of book. I'm not rating the contents of this book. I'm rating the disappointment this book will cause the readers. If I buy a book with a ""step by step"" clearly indicated on its title, I'm expecting to be walked through a project explaining the different features of ASP.net. Instead the author has used a style that is totally alien to the phrase ""step by step"". He should have looked at other ""step by step"" books to see how they present their subject to the reader."
1,An awful book,"Save your money. This book may help you bs your way through a simple tech. interview, but it is useless beyond that. For one thing the examples do not work. Plain and simple. I tried keying this in to simple files, copying them from the CD, running them straight off the CD and even coping them into a VS.Net project. They simply do not work. I got several error and once I finally got around them, certin page elements just wouldn't display.This is without a doubt the worst computer book I have ever bought. I'm not so much upset about the money I spent then I am about the time I wasted trying to get this piece of $hit to work."
1,Not for C# progremmers,"I would expect that a ""Step by Step"" book on such a basic .NET technology will provide the reader the option to learn ASP.NET with C#. After all, this is the language that was built from the ground up for .NET. It is like Java to J2EE environment. Microsoft Press and the author could do a better job."
2,A mile wide - an inch deep,"This book is a simple introduction to ASP.NET. The examples are of the ""hello world"" variety.I found the book particularly weak in web security which definitely requires more detail. For example, passport authentication gets only one paragraph on p 194.I bought the book in the hopes of getting good background for the ASP.NET certification exam ( 70-315 ). If passing this exam is your goal, I suggest you look elsewhere. I found Jessie Liberty's book much better ( still far from perfect ), but at least the Liberty book contains some solid technical writing and examples."
2,Not the Steps I was Looking For,"You would think that, with a title that includes the phrase 'step by step,' this book would help you learn ASP.NET in a step-wise approach including examples and maybe even exercises. Unfortunately, this is not the case. I found this book disappointing.""ASP.NET Step by Step"" contains articles that give a good theoretical understanding of ASP.NET. Had I been looking for this sort of information, I would have found this book more useful.The content of the book is good. It just isn't right for me.Recommend: QuestionableKeep for Reference: No"
2,"It's OK, but not much help in the ""real world""","For the real beginner in ASP.Net, this may be a good start, I thought it lacked any depth in real world applications. If we are to use ASP.Net as a platform for robust web based applications, this book does not succeed in giving the reader the tools needed to accomplish that. I was hoping for some more in depth coverage beyond ""Hello World"" examples. .Net is still fairly new and requires some explaining, even for veteran Microsoft based programmers. Although this book covers the basic areas well, it falls short after that. My frustration in getting the needed information caused me to add it to the shelf to collect dust. I am off to find something more useful."
2,Typos make this book useless,"It's not really a step by step book, and having made it halfway through, doing all the examples, I haven't learned much more than how to type. Granted, I have learned a little about syntax, format and other generalities.There are so many typos and outright errors, though, that I'm giving up, and moving on to another book."
2,A Sampler at Best,"The author seems confused as to whether he's writing a guide or a reference, and at best he winds up with what I would call a sampler.The other unfortunate thing is that the author beats the ""Hello World"" example to death. (He is still using ""Hello World"" on page 436 of 476 pages.) This leads to Bill's rule of computer publishing: Never ever under any circumstances let an author use ""Hello World"" past the second chapter of a book.Some portions of the book assume you've never seen computer code before while others assume you already know ASP. There are chapters on program language fundamentals, application configuration, security, ADO, web services, and every now and then a chapter on ASP.Net.Insofar as this book is a sampler you will not come away with an indepth understanding of ASP.Net. That is, unless you feel that you can fully understand the subtilties of a programming language by reviewing ""Hello World"" examples."
2,A dissapointing attempt to explain a great technology.,"I'm extremely disappointed in this book from Microsoft Press. While it does offer some great reference material for configuring the different config files, it fails in so many other area's that I wondered why Microsoft published it at all.The author fails to clearly explain the .net technology and writes a book that is filled with confusing examples, poor .net programming techniques and lots of references to other sources of information. Topics in this book are very dissorganizied. Many chapters are written in such a way that by it's end I had forgotten what the chapter was supposed to be about. Extremely important information is briefly mentioned, then brushed aside to keep the book moving to it's conclusion. Explainations into .net coding techniques are outside the scope of this book, but they shouldn't have been.I can't recommend this book to anyone. This book is no way ""Step by Step""."
1,A bad impression,I really disliked this book I think you can find a better source downloading a tutorial from the Internet. I am sorry that I bought this book.
3,"Try again, Microsoft Press...","Having read this book cover to cover for an informal class on the job and having used previous 'Step By Step' books (Visual Basic) I have a decent perspective on what to expect from such a title. It seems the book attempts to be part reference (Ok, ALOT reference), part instructional/how-to, but does't do a particularly good job of either. I didn't find an example worth going to my machine and working along with until at least page 250.My only thoery is that they wanted to release a book as early as possible with the release of ASP.net and rushed to put something in print using the reference sections as filler so the book looked thick enough. This edition just isn't up to the quality found in the later versions of VB's Step By Step series. If you want to learn ASP.net from the ground up, look elsewhere - just my $.02 ."
2,"Not a ""Step - By - Step"" Book","I purchased this book with the hope of having a relatively straight forward book that would walk me through the creation of an ASP.net Application ""Step-by-Step"". I guess I had set my hopes too high. I am already 300 pages into the book and I have only encountered one really useful example (in my opininon).This book does contain some very useful information, but it should not have been called a ""Step-By-Step"" book.Just a side note: C# is mentioned occasionally but this book is mainly discusses VB.net."
1,Where is the first step?,"This is not a step by step book; it was designed as reference type of book. I'm not rating the contents of this book. I'm rating the disappointment this book will cause the readers. If I buy a book with a ""step by step"" clearly indicated on its title, I'm expecting to be walked through a project explaining the different features of ASP.net. Instead the author has used a style that is totally alien to the phrase ""step by step"". He should have looked at other ""step by step"" books to see how they present their subject to the reader before he committed himself to writing this book."
3,OK - bUt not what I expected,"As a Java Developer coming from the world of J2EE, Struts, and JSPs I wanted a book that would provide a ""good"" introduction on ASP.NET. I picked this book because it was recommended on Microsoft's certification site. The book is not bad. There's a wealth of information provided. It does have its share of typos & errors but I did learn enough to start building some applications using ASP. My biggest complaint about the book was that all examples are in Visual Basic, which I have no interest in at all. I noticed now that the author has another book dealing with ASP.NET (published in April) that is focused on C#. That would have been the book that I would have liked to own but I'll save my money. If you're wanting an intro to ASP.NET with a Visual Basic focus this one is ""OK"". If you're more focused on C# wait for the April publication. Note - though - the examples are very simplified and in some cases only use code snippets to illustrate the author's point."
1,Spongebob,"he episodes were either bad or they had horrible endings. The one in the trench was possibly the worst episode ever and the other ones sucked also. Please, don't buy it."
3,Not as good as the TV series,"The movie was alright, but not as good as the TV series. Not as much action and audio as I expected. The grandchildren watched it but didn't ask to see it again. That tells me allot about what they thought about it."
1,"Product description says ""shape & tone""?",After a brief warm up this DVD is 41 minutes of athletic stretching. No toning here.
4,For the fans mainly.,"""Demolition Man"" is the only studio-track on this EP (from the Stallone/Snypes-movie of the same name), the other five from a consert in 1993 (or 94?) in Italy. At Villa Manin to be presise. King of pain, Love is stronger..., Shape of my heart, It's probably me and John Lennons' (and Beatles') A day in the life. The performance is great, but I wish they would have added If I ever lose my faith -I have it on vcr from the same show, and it sounds so ""mighty"" -that's the word. However, the recording offers a live-album-feel -and is one my most played from my collection."
4,"Nice, fun live EP","This is a 6 song ""EP"" released by Sting. The cover makes it appear like this CD is the soundtrack for the movie Domolition Man. But, it only contains the one song from the movie. The rest of the songs are live versions of Sting/Police classics. There is a real Demolition Man soundtrack CD available.Although this is an EP, it is almost the length of a normal ablum at 36 minutes. It is a fun, lively CD. The live recordings come from a concert in Italy, with a stripped down band, of drums, keyboards and guitar.(Sting usually tours with a much bigger band). This smaller band is able to really break lose. The live versions of the songs are stretched out between 5 to 7 minutes and are played with a lot of energy. Last song is an interesting version of the Beatle's A Day in the Life.This one of the last times Sting performed as a real rocker. In the Police, he was new wave raggae man. His first solo material was more jazz oriented. After this CD, he became a smarmy pop singer."
1,A caricature of suspense,"Midway through, ""Double Obsession"" begins to reek of ""Misery,"" when Heather cripples one of her objects of adoration, holds her hostage, and then commits assorted nasties against assorted interlopers. But there's no comparing the sad ""Double Obsession"" with the masterful ""Misery."" There are no characters here, only caricatures -- everyone is either psycho or insists on hanging out with psychos, but we have no idea why. Even ""Misery""'s truly psychotic Annie Wilkes was more believable. (And more sympathetic.) The soundtrack, by turns, steals suspense and turns suspense into goofiness. And Heather's ""psycho laugh"" is from Hitchcock by way of Bugs Bunny. If this weren't a feature-length film with professional sets and actors, I'd think it came from a high-school film class.I really hate writing this, 'cause I know Beth Fisher (Sherry). I'm sure it was the director's fault, Beth. 8o) Write me and I'll apologize to you directly!"
5,Raging Judge Magnum,"Fits the Raging Judge Magnum with the 6.5 barrel like a glove. Very well built, and will last a long time."
1,Terrible and overpriced,"I purchased these, and at first they seemed ok -- huge and heavy and over stuffed. However within less than a month the quills from the feathers (is there ANY down in these -- not that I can tell) were poking all the way through the ticking and my pillow cases and scratching me in the back. Uncomfortable to say the least -- plus if you were to rub your cheek on one it would really scratch you -- the quills are big.I contacted customer service and asked to please return them and they said no. They told me to buy my own covers for them to keep the feathers from poking through -- REALLY?? For this much money you get a pillow whose feathers are so big they poke through, ticking so thin it allows them to poke through, and a company too cheap to put its own covers on them -- even the cheap ones at Bed Bath and Beyond come in their own removable down proof covers. Hardly the ""super high quality"" advertised. Ridiculous. There goes $95 -- a total waste of money."
5,I am feelin' this,"I listened to 4 songs on cdbaby.com and from what I can tell, I like the style. The words are hot and the tracks are hot. I am buying this cd and definitely recommend it! We need more unique artists in the industry!"
4,Good Game,"The Game came in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. It was ""Like New"". My child finds the game very entertaining."
3,gift,this item was bought as a gift for the grand children. They seem to love it - I have no opinion.
5,My daughter loves playing.,"She is not very good at the actual driving at age 6, but she has just as much fun crashing as anything else. She doesn't car if she wins or loses. She does think it is fun to crash. If you like Cars and racking this is a great games. There are plenty of side (mini) games that you can play besides in story mode. It is worth getting."
2,Too difficult for targeted age group,Games: Racing and tip the tractors. Not sure what else since we got too frustrated with it to continue playing anymore. Oversteering in racing is difficult at best to try and control. Tractor tipping game is hard to control direction you are going also. 5-yr-old and 9-yr old don't bother with this game at all anymore despite the characters being just like the ones in the great movie.
3,"Not too bad, for an adult","This game isn't all that bad. I wish that you could use the steering wheel with it, but instead it has to be a regular controller and a nunchuck. I bought it for my 3 year old son and 4 year old daughter, and my daughter does okay on it but it's hard to advance on the game to a new board, and even I've tried it. I guess for the price, it's not all that bad."
4,Favourite cartoon classics... great !,That's a great VHS. It's a great reminder for some cartoons. I like it !
2,good but a little boring,i found this book interesting in places but boring in others. author is sorely in need of an editor.
3,"Not my Favorite, but not Unlikeable either","I really love Kingsbury's books. The Baxter series, the Take 1-4 love them. This one was okay, and even peaked my interest, but it took until chapter 3 to gain some interest, then right towards the end, eh. I still read the whole thing, but I just not my total fav."
5,book review,"The book was received in excellent condition. Just like new! It is a great read. Highly recommend it. Difficult subject at some points, but you really get inside these characters because of it."
3,Not Devine for me,"I have read many books by Karen Kingsbury, but this one just fell short. It was all too tidy and contrived. Although the story was interesting and moved quickly. It shows that Karen must not have ever seen someone addicted to Crack or cocain, they don't give it up that easily no matter how much they love the lord. It just did not feel real to me and seemed not at all plausible. Karen has talent it was just wasted on this book."
4,enjoyable,I read the whole book in 2 days while at a bed & breakfast. It was an interesting concept to weave a modern day story relating to Mary Magdelene. I like all her books I've read so far!
5,Great book,I was very pleased at the condition of this book when I recieved it. I usually buy new but the price was so inexpensive that I thought I'd try used this time. It was a good choice. Came in a timely manner in excellent cndition. Highly recomend both the book and the seller.
5,Life is Divine,"I have read several books by Karen Kingsbury and was anxious to read Divine. I really enjoyed the book. Her other books have always been interesting but this one pulled me in more than usual. It was difficult to put it down, always looking forward to where the story was going to go.The story is about Mary Madison telling her story of abuse to another woman who had just left an abusive relationship. She used her story to show that no matter how bad you think your life if and it is not worth living, there is a reason for you to be here. Mary had been taken from her mother at an young age and abused for several years. Years after being rescued, she became an advocate for abused individuals.Karen Kingsbury has a great talent of storytelling and keeping the reader interested. It felt like you knew the characters."
2,Huge Karen KIngsbury reader but.....,"As I entitled this review, I am a HUGE Karen Kingsbury fan, but I found this particular work to be too dark. Realism is fine and it does have some redemptive value to be sure as well as spotlight certain issues, but again I found this one to be too depressing and just too ""dark."" I have probably read almost all Kingsbury's novels. I like them and I recommend them, but probably not THIS one."
1,I simply couldn't finish it.,"I really hate starting a book and not completing it, but I found Divine to be an utter waste of time, and had to abandon it early on. I stopped before giving myself a headache from constant eye rolling.I feel that the author was writing about things she has no concept of. What should have been serious came across as laughable [""she would take three times the crack she's ever taken before"", really?], and the tragic abuse suffered by the protagonist read as if the author researched the subject by watching a Law and Order SVU marathon.I had never read Kingsbury before, and I will not be reading her again."
2,Too Much,"First off, I did finish the book. Second, I am a deep main line Christian third, I love to read.HOWEVERThe story here seems a thin disguise to preach. It seemed the scenes were set up just to lead to a rather long push to accept Christ. And I already have.I wonder if we aren't preaching to the choir? Or rather beating us up and turning us off.So who would read this book? I sure would not recommend this to anyone unless it was an exercise in what not to write."
2,TOO INTENSE FOR A CHRISTIAN BOOK,"Though I know the author meant well, it is too intense of a story for christians AND especially for victims of sexual abuse!"
1,too graphic not even scripture,karen kingsbury has always been a favorite of mine. Why she chose this topic I am unsure. As a Christian we already have plenty of negative in the world not to read about it in depth. I kept telling myself that she will prove herself but I felt she did not. With such a deep topic more scripture should have been introduced. We do have a Divine God and she did show some but more could have been shown. I have and will discourage people to read this book.
4,Divine,She brings tact and understanding to one who has been trapped in the mire and emerged a survivor.. This is for those who have been trapped or had loved ones. Worth the time...
4,HP Pavillion Notebook N5495 is awesome!,"I recently purchased this to use in addition to our desktop computer. Not using the desktop computer much these days though- the notebook blows it away!!! It's superfast, the display is great, and I am loving Windows XP (after still having Windows 95 on our desktop computer). Works absolutely terrific with my digital camera-I bought a pc card adapter for my compact flash card and it makes viewing pictures a snap. Only disappointment would be that there was not a photo editing program included with the software bundle.Another neat feature is that it has a voice recorder. I was able to record my kids singing christmas carols and then use the burner to put it right on CD. How cool is that!?!!I'm still exploring all the features it has but so far I'm thrilled."
2,****Not a desktop replacement.,I recommend this laptop if you are not going to use graphic intensive programs. FPS games =(
1,I GOT RIPPED OFF!,"Seriously?? I got this book used, guaranteed that it was satisfactory and had the CD in it. When I recieved the book....NO CD!!! I canot return it because the return date is past, and no store will be willing to buy a used book with no cd. The book is utterly useless without the CD. Dont trust this seller."
1,Sent incorrect edition,"The right book was sent to me, but the 2nd edition was sent to me, when the ISBN for the 3rd edition was searched for. I had to buy a new book from my school."
1,Didn't think,"Sender didn't think about the CD-Rom in the back getting damaged and when the soft cover book was sent in a soft package, I received the CD snapped clean in half. I needed it for my class, and was luckily able to share with a friend to do the homework."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!,The discription on the product clearly says WITH CDthe product was sent to me and did not have a CDand i contacted the seller and did not suggest a refund or any other optionsinstead shows me a lie about the product saying that it did not have CD
4,Almost Has It All!,"If 4 1/2 stars was an option, I would have gone with that. To me, this is an absolutely fantastic 2 Disk set.There are 2 issues/complaints that I have, and they are relatively minor. Personally, I love the song ""Tomorrow"" and was very disappointed to see that it wasn't on there. It's ""Carrie"" Part 2, and if you love ""Carrie"", you probably love ""Tomorrow"". I'm not sure why this one was omitted, but nonetheless, it is absent from this recording.My other problem is that the song ""Open Your Heart"", which was one of my favorites back in the day, has been drastically altered. I don't care for this new version, and I would have liked it better if they left it alone.Aside from those very minor complaints, it's awesome and well worth it!"
5,Shoes of a Beast,"This was pretty much the most highly-anticipated EP in the indie-rock world, and I'll be the first to say that it is incredible. I didn't know whether to believe all the buzz on the web, but Peter Toh comes through with 5 certified jams that you will go back to listen to, again and again."
5,amazing color,"like always from a manic panic product, amazing color durability throught many washes and very vibrant over bleached hair.if i can figure out how to show a customer image i will to show the results. if you get this product you will not be dissapointed :D"
3,Mehhh,"Didn't like to stay in for long. Put in right after i bleached out my hair and kept under hot wrap all night. only lasted 3 or 4 washes, and after that i just slapped the color right on and left it for 2 washes worth color. Otherwise so gentle and tested on humans so I don't feel bad about putting it on my dog =P"
5,Engaging and informative,"Reading Dorothy Sucher's book, THE INVISIBLE GARDEN, I found myself relating to her experiences in both the real garden and the invisible garden. Her style of writing is very appealing and I felt as if I could hear her talking to me as I read. I highly recommend it to everyone and particularly to ""book clubs"" as it is guaranteed to provoke thoughtful and interesting conversation."
5,My boys love it!,"My sons are 4 and 7. I got this for them because they really enjoy megablocks and legos. It's a great way for them to be creative and entertained with a minimal mess. When I recieved this package, it was so much bigger than I thought it would be and it had so many little guys! They are really cute on bikes and skate boards and such. My boys were so happy with it."
1,Don't buy the SLPD-9!,"Do not buy this product! I bought the SLPD-9 in Fall 2002 and it started skipping on all discs played in under 6 months. The repair experience I've had has been the worst imaginable. Technics/Panasonic has been giving me the run around. The repair shop they use in New York City (Advisory TV and Radio) has twice told me they fixed the unit when they have not. And Panasonic/Technics refuses to do anything about. I've never had such a bad experience with a product in my life. Trust me, unless you want to buy a CD changer that lasts only 6 months, don't buy the SLPD-9."
1,Do not buy this machine. Spend the money and buy a GR.,The FXA series suffers many problems that almost require a website to build some solidarity amongst users it has been burdened with. You may wonder how I know the things below. Well having had two models of the FXA series you can find the problems pretty quickly.1. For starters this machine has trouble regulating its internal temperature causing it to seize. This problem comes and goes.2. The docking mechanism for those who don't have one has a flaw in it. Sony didn't do a blanket recall. They want you to call them to get it fixed. It involves putting a new capacitor to regulate the video signal.3. Sony will try and not fix it until your warranty runs out. We excecised our retailer warranty and upgraded to get rid of our FXA49 which had been in Four times.4. The laptop has software compatibility issues for the power user. Virus scanners will almost certainly halt the machine. Including the one provided by Sony.
1,iamcde,"What a piece of crap!!! Thank God I bought an extended warranty...too bad for the warranty company. There have been over $10,000 in repairs done to this unit, the original cost before warranty $2300. I don't travel much with it, it sits on a desk. They have replaced monitor 2x, the harddrive 2 or 3x, the cd/dvd drive 2x and it is still broken, the keyboard 1x, the motherboard 1x (that I know of), it blue screens weekly at least once sometimes 2 & 3 times and the battery has never worked. I contacted Sony and got no assistance from them. I don't recommend this unit to anyone...get an IBM!!"
1,LIFE SPAN OF SIX MONTHS,"I bought a refurbished vaio on line. It lasted six months, with a 90 day warranty. SONY's telephone help is worthless, and to get any tech help costs [money] just to talk to one of their people. I won't buy another Sony, ever."
1,Big Trouble With Sony and FXA36,"This is the second Sony Laptop I have owned. The first was fantastic. Lots of pirks - fast - pleasure to use.I decided to spend more money and buy a higher end laptop. The FXA36 would not dial up straight out of the box. Yes, you read right - a computer had a modem that would not work. The interesting thing was you had to go on the internet to get a ""fix"".I own two desktop computers - one is a 2ghz. Both operate perfectly on the phone line. The sony hangs up, has trouble connecting, produces loud static, and rarely connects over 24kps....P>BEWARE - there still isn't a fix for the problem and my laptop is still under warranty."
5,best narcocorrido book,"it really is interesting and fun to read, I read it in a day cause it keeps you wanting to read more"
1,Pure junk,"Unbelievable how loud this little unit can get, even with my demolition earphones on, it was still hurting my ears. Takes forever to fill the tank and it's only 100psi! Finally, my unit started making strange noises during a refill and then ceased to function any further. Apparently, the internals have seized and there's nothing that can be done about it."
4,Pleasant to the ears!,"I've always been a Mamas and Papas fan since I was 11 years old (being that I'm 23 at this time). I had listened to their greatest hits album for several years and recently had started buying each album they had released, getting a hold of the ""not-so-greatest"" songs. To tell you honestly, many of their songs that are not considered the greatest, are my most favorite as well. On the album, DELIVER, there are 7 songs that I didn't grow up listening to and 6 of those I like--excluding the song, ""John's Music Box"", which really has no point on the album and makes me want to hit the stop button on my CD player. Every other song is a work of 60's art."
5,nice,This tire cover was just what I wanted and ordered. It was received in a timely manner. Thank you. Nice fit also.
1,All milk frothers are not created equal,"I thought all milk frothers were the same until I accidentally broke the one we had purchased in Italy and bought this as a replacement. There are several things wrong with this model. First, there is no pour spout and the very pronounced lip around the edge of the cup means that I am almost always spilling milk down the side while I try to pour it into a coffee cup. Second, the seal around the plunger and the top of the cup is not as good as our last one and foam oozes out while I froth the milk. Finally, this is opaque whereas our previous one was pyrex. I can no longer see in the microwave when the milk was just about to boil. Milk too cool won't foam and boiled milk is not good either. I am surprised to find myself annoyed enough with this to consider tossing it and buying another."
3,milk frother is fine,"We went through a few glass milk frothers over a period of years. They made incredible foam quickly and easily, but were fragile and broke easily.We purchased this frother for its sturdiness. The mug itself seems to be quality, but the plastic plunger and parts don't seem incredibly well made. We'll see how they last - we've only had the product for a month.It's smaller than we thought it would be, and we're not overly impressed with how much foam it makes. It requires a lot more plunging than any of the glass ones we've used. It does seem better than the battery operated 'whiskers' though. Overall, it seems a little expensive for what we got, but if it lasts for years as others reviewers claim, maybe it will be worth it."
1,Does not work as advertised,"I do not know why anyone would give this a rave review. In lieu of an espresso machine if you want a frother buy one of those battery powered aerolatte things. this does not froth milk at all and trust me, I followed the instructions. It does spill all over the counter. You can get more froth by blowing bubbles through a straw. Save your money. I would return it, but the package got discarded--oh well a really expensive coffee mug I guess."
2,"Clear picture, mono sound","This is a nice concert with a nice clear picture, but the sound is mono - no sound coming from anything but the center channel speaker, even though the box says ""Dolby Digital Surround""."
3,Copy was not so good,Actually the music was wonderfull but on the copy of the DVD I got the picture kept droping out I don't know if this was just a fluke in production or if ths problem was the same with all copies.
1,Worst. Translations. Ever.,"Do NOT buy this book for the English translations - it often seems that the author is a student who is attempting to complete an assignment in the hour remaining before his high school Spanish class. Please republish this book as ""Pablo Neruda: What I Think He's Saying - Ben Belitt"". Awful at best."
1,Just compare the introductions,"I have never read Neruda but recevied this as a gift. I sat down to read the introduction by the translator and was confused and dismayed from the beginning.The language was incomprehensible and seemingly purposefully complex. Then I read the intro by Neruda which was a thing of beauty.I read the English ""translation"" of the first couple of poems and was again dismayed. Then I started comparing the Spanish and decided that there were MANY phrases which seemed to be odd translations. At first I thought that I was just unaccustomed to translated poetry but the more I read the more sure I was that the translations were off. I too was surprised that despite my limited Spanish and lack of prior exposure to Neruda I could immediately tell that the translations were bizarre. I described this to my family and finally started checking other people's responses on line and I am relieved to find that I was not alone. I am looking for a different translation."
2,a mediocre start.....,"this is my first book by Ms. Chase. I was quite looking forward due to reviews of her newer books. Sadly, this book, in my opinion, is sore lacking in entertainment value. The main problems were, 1)-not enough quality interactions between the hero/heroine, and WAY to many scenes were they begin to like each other, but, of course, a ""misunderstanding"" occurs to quickly pull them apart again. 2)-the annoying Basil-he should have been taken out of the book early on. 3)-the introduction of so many side characters as to make the story very hard to follow.All, in all, sadly, I'd say skip this book.2.5 stars."
4,Glad to have had access to it,"While this lacked the polish of more recent Loretta Chase books, it was still one heck of an enjoyable story. The biggest problem was a Kindle formatting issue. This book changes POV very frequently; the original paper version must have had additional space or a line to indicate the switch that is missing in the Kindle edition. The lack of delineation caused some confusion at times. Even with the formatting issues, though, snap it up. An occasionally confusing Loretta Chase book is still well worth your time."
2,Lacks chemistry,"Not at all like the others of her books available in Kincle format which I read first. This book fails on a number of fronts. The Earl of Hartleigh is like a paper cut out of the handsome hero, the only male character of any depth is his cousin Basil. Isabella is in theory my favourite heroine type - an older, more sensible female- but she fails to come alive for me. The romance does not work. I felt no connection. The book has glimmers of the wit that is in others the author has written but fails to deliver. The lack of steamy sex scenes is not a problem here given the lack of chemistry between the lovers. A penny dreadful - Please do not take this as a epresentative sample of Ms Chase's work, you will miss out on some wonderful stories if you do. If this is your first Chase book to consider buying please move on!"
3,Not Loretta's Best,"This is an early book and it shows. Still, it's worth reading for the backstory for the companion book (The English Witch) which is much better."
3,Isabella,"I would have given a better rating, as I enjoyed the plot and most of the characters. However, I cannot abide when one scene goes directly into the next without any indication the scene has changed."
3,Not as good as Basil's story,"I confess that I read Basil's story firstThe English Witch, which I really enjoyed. Because I liked him and this previous book was referred to, I decided to buy and read this one. Unfortunately Basil is awful and a real rogue in this book. I found that chemistry was lacking between the H and h. Maybe it was because of the many descriptions of the h but I found her lacking somehow. Anyway perhaps if you read the books in order, you will enjoy this book more than I did."
5,Avg transformation difficulty and sturdy materials.,"For those interested in this kind of toy, this one is not a challenge for the veteran transformer fan. The sturdy materials is a pro although most of these toys come with parts that can be slipped on if separated which is very useful in the more difficult versions to assemble. Just note that this is the same as the BT-15 model for some reason."
5,The secret of good health,"This is an amazing book written by a Professor of Psychiatry and practising psychiatrist who thinks outside the box. Yes, a pill or medical procedure relieves pain but this good doctor wants to understand the source of a patient's pain. In treating emotional disorders he might try acupuncture, EMDR (eye movement therapy), or nutritional supplements and personally if I was out of control I would prefer taking fish oil to having someone tamper with my brain. The author relates many personal experiences and his encounters with patients are always compassionate. Ultimately he tells us that the secret to health is stress management, exercise and improved nutrition."
4,Foundation blocks of wellness,"This book gives both an excellent scientific basis (the author is an MD and a neuroscientist) for how emotions work and an excellent roadmap for how to gain emotional wellness through the physical self (attention to certain dietary aspects, exercise, and Eastern practices, along with the author's special technique of EMDR.) This book is easy to read and understand, with excellent practical advice. It is refreshing to get advice from a Western doctor that is not just about pill-pushing! The ideas and goals in the book are attainable by everyone."
3,"Nice sound, watch for cracks","I purchased 2 sets of these eggs for me and my kids (ages 1 and 7), and they sound great and they're a nice size. Unfortunately, my one child was trying to juggle with them and 2 of them split open (thankfully they had just cracked open slightly so only a few beads got out, not all of them), but they did start to leak. I know they're not meant for juggling, but I just want to make sure you know that if you do drop them (and it probably only happened a dozen times or so), they may break open and then tiny beads will scatter everywhere. Just shake them and use them only as intended and you'll be fine!"
5,Easy to control,"As egg shakers go, you may find better out there, but these are good for most purposes. I wouldn't hesitate to use these in a performance, and first timers seem to have an easy time picking them up."
2,MISLEADING,"It claims it is a double pack, true, there were two but the way it looks, you would expect to get four eggs, thinking a pair was one. You can buy them at your local music store at half of this price we found out later."
4,It's alright.,"It's alright, great for children specially little ones. I expected different material though, not hard plastic. Overall its a great item, sound great."
3,"Great sound, not well built",The shakers make great sound and I am happy with them so far. I use them at work to celebrate when one of my employees makes a sale over the phone. Only problem is they are starting to come apart. I do not shake them hard because we are in a work environment. I could only imagine an entertainer shaking these with all their might and having the material inside fly out into the crowd.
5,ILOVE THEM,"One of mine's cracked, but i closed it and well again, i love them, easy to hold and keep in control.:P"
5,nice melow lil shakers,"Cant go wrong for a dollar a pair as long as you dont try to cook them... nice ""chicka chicka"" sounds all the way to ""tish, icka tish, icka"""
4,"NOT A MASTERPIECE, BUT IT WILL MORE THAN DO!","The album actually comprises 2 Christophe albums, 1965's ALINE and 1972's THE GIRL FROM SALINA, the title track of which is sadly omitted from the tracklist, as well as a couple of other selections of the early 70s. It's incredible to discover by listening to this cd how Christophe grew and changed over the years. His constant seeking for new formulas and sounds in music made his work higher in quality. You can easily feel the singer's agony in ""Aline"", get lost in the chaotic utopia of ""Main dans la main"", get interested in the mystery concerning ""La petite fille du 3eme""(my personal favourite on this cd), get absorbed in the almost straight-out-of-a- theatrical-play feel of ""Je ne t'aime plus"" and ""Les marionettes""... This collection of songs successfully portrays the various aspects of Christophe's talent and it's worth of anybody's time and money!"
3,Aline,"It came to my front door when i wasn't home .Thanks ,i loved it ,the only technicality was the audio not so great ."
4,"Good, But Thomas Sowell Has Done Even Better","The only drawback to a collection of newspaper columns like the present volume is that, as is usually the case with good writers, the quality of their writing is not quite as high as it is in their other books. Having said that, I must say this book is still good enough.I think the best article is ""Another Outrage,"" detailing Bill Clinton's unpatriotic speech at Georgetown University in the wake of the events of 9/11/01. Like Sowell, I am sick and tired of people who think present-day Americans are ""paying the price"" for having owned slaves and killed Indians. Those who think America is the cause of all the world's problems find kindred spirits in Bill and Hillary. Thomas Sowell isn't fooled."
2,Sowell as journalist,"Sowell is a better scholar than journalist. He should stick to his scholarly writing and leave the journalism to people who write with more grace, wit, and charm than he does. I stress that I respect the man's scholarship and I have learned a tremendous amount from him (I've read four or five of his books). But I would avoid those books of his that--like this one--are collections of his newspaper and magazine columns. (It really seems as if he doesn't have much respect for journalism; his journalistic writing is sometimes downright sloppy, which is a surprise for a man whose scholarly work is anything but sloppy.)"
1,size lies very loud,"May fit a very small person if they hold there breath and yank real hard and fast. It is very loud. Can be heard across the room. Wear it out,yea right if you want people to point and laugh."
2,Not stealthy,This would be a great product if they could figure a way to make the darn thing so it wasn't so loud. Can't be used in a public place unless it's a rock concert.
2,Loud,"its too loud.... you could hear it over our convorsation at the dinner table.If they could fix the problem of it being so loud, then I would recommend this product."
1,WORST...PURCHASE...EVER.,"Where do I start? To say it's VERY loud is an understatement, it could wake up the neighbours! Unless you're somewhere VERY loud (ie; A GWAR concert)it's completely useless. The range is about 6', not 12'. I might as well have just thrown my money in the garbage."
1,Doesn't measure up to previous products,"This was not the first of these remote controlled vibrators my wife and I purchased, but it by *far* the loudest. Never even used it, because it was just too loud even for a loud room like a club or restaurant. Very disappointed, even more so because even though it was never used it is non-returnable. Avoid this product unless you only intend to use it in private in your own home. And, let's face it, if that's what you wanted to use it for, you wouldn't need a wireless remote control."
1,OMG! You could wake up the neighbors.,"I love Amazon but this was a bad buy. Quality was poor. One speed and the vibration sound was really, really loud. Too loud...very disappointed because I loved the idea."
1,"very bad, didn't work and doesn't fit medium size even","I didn't like it at all, I feel that I wasted my money. I didn't even get to use the Panty itself alone because it didn't fit me even my size is medium only.I didn't get any benefit out of it, but I lost my money because it went for waste."
1,Unhappy,"I was very disappointed with this product. I was unable to try it because of the panty size, extra extra small. One size does not fit all. This product should come in different sizes for different body types."
2,all jake up,"like everyone say it run small, and it too loud , so the only way you gone to like it if you size 1 or 2 an gone to hold you close, there a no return policy that not state so you may want to just look on adam eve"
1,Wasn't what I expected,"I thought it had an adjustable speed, it did not. The vibrating component was very very loud. Not discreet at all!"
1,Not what I expected,"After reading the product description, and once receiving the product, I'd say it really wasn't what I expected. The underwear are sized xx-small I'm guessing because they didn't fit. And I wear a size S. The vibrator it's self though can fit in any type of women's underwear, you just have to slide it in. The battery on the remote was easy to put in but I had to use pliers to adjust the coils so it'd work. One last thing the vibrations are not discreet at all, if you planned on using this in public I suggest you shouldn't. It's extremely loud sounds like a 18 wheeler using its Jake Brakes on a hill if you even cross your legs to muffle the sound. Very embarrassing."
2,To loud,"To loud ,they also did not come with a battery for the panties!! They are very disappointing!!! Will not buy again!!"
1,Terrible,"Do not get this product it was loud not effective and a huge waste of money. I wouldnt recommend this to anybody, just twerrible"
1,Buyer Beware,"Quality and sizing of product is not up to acceptable expectation, either is the customer service of the third party merchant. Do not waste your time or money."
1,The worst gimmick ever. Unusable.,"Soooo disappointed in this product. Wasn't able to use it at all. Firstly, I am a size 10. The underwear are for a size 4. Couldn't even get them over the hips. Secondly, it was VERY loud. Not at all subtle or demure. One wouldn't be able to be in public or even behind a closed door without others obviously hearing it. Unfortunately, this item has no return policy. I can understand the underwear part of that but the company should at least offer a prorated return on the electronice device. Will never order another Berman Center product again. Too bad because I like Dr. Berman's website for it's info. I'm suckered out of $45.00Berman Center Astrea Remote Vibrating Thong"
3,Fun but has drawbacks,"Product was inexpensive compared to competitor products (nice for a novelty item). It's a fun idea but the vibrator does not stay up in the area where you would like it to be (would give this 5 stars if it did). I think this is because the panties are built like any other panty, where the seam for the cotton liner at the bottom creates a ""pocket"" between the liner and the panty. It seems like they just used regular lace panties and did not think about the logistics of having the vibrator sit a little higher. I may remedy this by sewing in a bigger liner and a horizontal seam. The panties do run pretty small. I bought a S/M, they fit like XS/S. The vibrator is a little noisy, need to use in a noisy atmosphere unless you want everyone to know you're wearing it!Overall, a good price for a novelty item but the construction is not great."
3,Somewhat pleased,"The product works as described. The only problem is that it's bigger and louder than I thought it would be, and the underwear are deceptively small. All in all though, it works very well and I do recommend it as long as size and sound aren't a concern."
4,"Fun Item, Wife Loves It","Got this for my wife for a little fun item. We both like the wireless remote for the surprise and control factors. It is enough to get her going and ready for fun later. The one size fits all panties are really small. My wife is a size 8 and the panties were very, very tight. We put the vibrator in a pair of her regular Victoria's Secret panties and it works great."
2,UnderBeware,"I bought this knowing that the vibration falls down way to low. According to my gf, it goes near the butthole. It was an intimate present but turn into a gag gift. It was fun when we first turn it on, she was laughing and jumping around so much that it was still worth it. I wish they would make the pouch all the way up near the underwear band and have certain area velcro so my gf have more control on where to put the device. It needs to be higher in the front."
1,DO NOT BUY,"My husband bought me these to have fun with. Sadly put them together.... what happens it doesnt work. Try new batts maybe thats the problem nope!!! It just doesnt work so just going to throw them out and say the hell with it and go to a store and buy real ones that will actually fit. DO NOT BUY, go to the store yourself and pick some working ones up."
1,No return - even unopened,Although a nice novelty gift - Amazon does not allow it to be returned EVEN UNOPENED. Does not say anywhere on order page. Don't buy this here!!!
2,"No, one size does not fit most!",The panties are one size fits most....if you consider most women to be size 2-4. I am not that big and these were WAY small on me.
3,"Does the job, kinda.","Though the product works in most of the ways it's supposed to, I would highly recommend it only be used in places with background noise as the vibrator is far, FAR from discreet even under layers of clothes. Its a shame it only has an on or off function, it was however plenty of fun to play with my other half and the remote :)"
2,not what I expected,The product did not meet my expectations.The vibrator is very noisy and had one setting....It will make a rather expensive gag gift...
3,Okay,"Loud, but I guess did the job. Could be a bit much after a few minutes from what I was told. Bulky also."
2,Does get your girl going.... Just can't use them anywhere,"These panties are comfortable and they vibe works good, however it's very very loud, like and old school Nextel on vibrate, I am looking go modify it with duck tape, I think the poor design allows the battery to rattle around and the ability to compress it together should take some of that away"
3,Funbration!!,This is so much fun when your mate has the control. You don't have to worry about the size of the undies. As long as your undies liner has one end that opens. The vibrator seems a little loud at first but no one should here it. Luckily it sounds like a cell phone vibration mode.
2,only for skinny ladies,"I bought this for my wife and it is way too small. She's not that big, but then again, neither is this product.Only for skinny ladies, not for normal ones."
1,DISAPPOINTED,Product was too inexpensive when compared to competitor products (nice for a novelty item). It's a fun idea but the vibrator does not stay up in the area where you would like it to be. Probably the biggest disappointment associated with the product is the size of the panties. They were too small and wife was unable to wear them or use them. We wasted money on this product.
1,Mislabled & mistake,"This is a cheap knock off of a real romote vib panty. Vibrator's pouch is at the vag opening, not near the clit. Dr B, it's a rip off. Do not waste your money. Panty is big enough for a pre pub girl. Cheaply made too"
1,One Size fits most? Not,These panties did not have a size selection. They are XS/S and they have very little stretch. If you are anything more than a size 6/8 do not order these. They cannot be reurned. I am very disappointed.
2,not worth the price.,"not the best for the price you pay. panties are a small. not one size fits all. vibrating bullet is bulky and not as quiet as you would like.honestly, its would be cheaper to go to victorias secret, getting a pair of lacie panties, go to spencers or a sex shop, buy a bullet, and call it a day."
3,Same as the other reviews,"Same as all the other reviews; the pocket for the vibrator is no where close to where it should be, resulting in what feels like a vibrating turd, my gf and i just used it in another set of panties and it stayed put for the most part. A little noisy but if you go to a chili's or applebee's no one's the wiser! Still a fun little toy."
1,"M.C., a disappointed couple!",The item I received never worked. I called and Amazon.com sent me a replacement item which did not work for even a second either. No one should buy this product. The product is not worth even a dollar.
1,too loud and in wrong place,"wife says nice quality except for how noisy the vibrator is-- makes for difficulty in being discrete, and the vibrator is in the wrong place-- figured it should be up front, but is actually in between the front and back-- am going to return this to manufacturer-- not happy"
1,There are better options than this CD set.,"If you're a European planning to learn a little Spanish for travel or business in Spain, then this may be a good resource for you. However, taking into consideration that in Latin America, México alone has nearly 3 times the population of Spain, if you are planning to use this series for learning Spanish for use in any other country but Spain, it will only make your learning experience much more frustrating. Most Spanish words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled - no great mystery. But in Spain, this is not the case. If you want to learn to speak Spanish with a lisp, by all means, buy this course. There are far better resources out there than this. Avoid it."
2,Gorgeous but don't work,I keep hoping that they'll get brighter but they haven't yet. They do look nice... I've received several compliments. But I still have people stumbling up a dark driveway.
4,"Very good quality and fun RPG, but very vauge rules.","My friend and I picked this up quite some time ago and we both, along with a few other friends find it thuroughly enjoyable. As an RPG, it's very fun as long as you can figure out how to play. The rules are vauge and inconsistant, and leave tons of room for interpretation by the GM. I have found that the other books for this RPG (After the Bomb, Transdementional TMNT, etc.) are good quality also, but are hard to link into an already existing game."
5,Awesome - Awesome -Awesome.,"If you like TMNT or just mutant animals in general then this book is bomb-astic and a must have!It works off of the Heroes Unlimited / Paladium system. I personally don't mind the system. If I had a complaint its with XP. Its a D&D; style 'Level 1 to Level 2' type of game mechanic. If tha doesn't bother you, then the rest of this game is golden. ALSO its Multi-Die...yet again don't let that scare you off. ( I don't know why it would. I love multi-die)All in All, I'd say pick it up. Its a little harder to find, but well worth it. You could run a simple friday or saturday night game with this OR an extended campaign. Its all up to you."
1,too simplistic,"After getting this book from the library, I quickly learned that this book spends far too much time on the basic statistics and not nearly enough on what I actually want to do. When ""complex statistics"" includes one-way ANOVA, covered in about 1 page, I know the book isn't going to be helpful on its own."
1,Counterfeit Software,"COUNTERFEIT SOFTWARE! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS VENDOR !!Once loaded, unable to pass the Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) test for Microsoft Genuine software. Logged onto the XP forums and if the software does not pass the WGA test, it is considered a counterfeit software. With the WGA diag tool, the included CD is a RETAIL version of XP Pro and NOT the OEM system builders version. No response from the seller with my querries."
1,Unsatisfactory,"When I tried to validate this software with Microsoft by using the product code, the validation was denied. Apparently someone had previously used this product code to install the product on his computer. Therefore this purchase is totally useless and I have simply lost the money I paid for it."
1,dont buy from this seller it is a fake,the cd i got from this seller didnt work. I emailed him about it and he just gave me a different code for xp. it didnt resolve my problem at all and now i have to buy another cd.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"Item took over two weeks two arrive, when it finally arrived it was sent back in his packaging unopened. Seller refused to issue a refund even though the item was returned luckily Amazon refunded the money and will be going after the seller.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!I have been buying and selling stuff on the internet for years and this is the first time I have EVER written a bad review, this seller is not professional and gave no communication."
5,Interstellar Inspiration,"Shear technical perfection. These arrangements transport me to another dimension. By far, one of the best selections is the Cowboys theme. I can't imagine my disliking this piece, unless perhaps I were accustomed to living amongst cattle and harmonica music. Each selection is captivating. Get the CD!"
5,Reuniting with an old friend,"I have always been a fan John williams music. When my wife and I were married, our friends went in together and bought us our first CD player. Along with it was this CD. Years later, I loaned it to a co-worker who never returned it. I was never able to find it until I looked on Amazon.This recording has, what I feel, are John Williams' best compositions. The Boston Pops plays amazingly well, especially the low brass."
5,Will make a fan out of you!,"And if you're not yet a devoted BPO/John Williams fan, this is the album that will convert you. One of my favorite CD's in my stack for a very simple reason- it's good for all moods! When I need some relaxation, Luke and Leia Theme (Return Of The Jedi) or Yoda's Theme (The Empire Strikes Back) are in order. When pushing the lawnmower in the Texas 110 degree summers, the only tracks that get me motivated would be Raiders Of The Lost Ark, or the Star Wars set. If I finish the lawn before the CD is over, you'll see me mow a second time! In a celebratory state? Olympic Fanfare and E. T. Flying Theme will keep you there. Bottom line? It doesn't matter if you are a classical/film music fan or not, this is the CD for you! And for the classical fans, don't be turned off by the genre. It's classic Williams- at his finest."
4,There's some great stuff on this CD,The Midway March alone is worth the price of the disc. Only one track (Close Encounters) falls short. The rest of the cuts range from good to excellent.
3,Disappointed,"It was defective. They never sent a replacement. Was told over the phone that they would, but they never did."
5,Williams at his best,"John Williams has composed some of the best movie music of all time. Most of his themes--like Jaws, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones--are instantly recognizeable and part of the fabric of pop culture.Being a fan, I picked up this CD because it claimed to be some of his very best. This statement is true. There's some of his best work here--like, as previously mentioned, the Jaws theme, the Star Wars theme, etc.--and some other greats like the NBC Nightly News Theme (I didn't know he had composed that) and Yoda's theme.If you're a John Williams fan, I'd recommend this CD. The only song really missing is Duel of the Fates, but he composed that after this CD was created."
5,WOW.....,All I can say is WOW....this system is awesome. We probably won't be going to the movies quite as much now that we can bring theater sound to our living room...this is a great investment and so easy to hook up. We had is ready to go in under 30 minutes. I would recommend to anyone!
4,big sound in a normal looking package,"Function:The 3-2-1 makes for a very smooth desktop stereo, and has three external inputs- video 1, 2 and Aux, which means you can plug evreything into it, such as computer audio, X10 wired camera (w/audio), playstation, etc...Style:The desk-unit itself is very simple and clean looking, not flashy at all, drawing little attention until you hear it. It is actually extremely small for a STEREO/DVD/AMP/ because the amplifier component is built in to the subwoofer. The LED display is cool green.Other things:The speakers do not come with mounting brackets or stands.The mp3 CD playing function works, but does not display song information.It really is a very high-end mini-system with DVD, rather than a surround system."
3,Not enough bang for the buck,"The BOSE-321 is a pretty good home theater systems. Itis not at all bulky, in fact it is very sleek and stylish.Installation was a snap, and ease of use makes it so simple thateven a toddler could use it. The systems sounds verygood as well, but for [price] I expected a more. I don'tthink this system delivers on the claim of surround soundmovie theater experience."
3,"Best stereo, average surround","Bose is probably the best sound company out there. So when I got this for my home theater, I had big expectations for the first two-speaker surround system.What I got was a system that has the best stereo sound I've ever heard, but this is supposed to be surround. That's what I don't always experience when I watch a movie. In addition, the system has multiple errors that occur (volume won't turn up all the way, certain DVD sounds won't work properly, skipping on CD's and DVD's, etc.) While this can be easily solved by removing power from the system, I have to do it every 3 to 4 months. Not exactly what I would expect from a top quality company like Bose.If you want a fairly inexpensive Bose system for your household, you should consider this system. But for those who want a full surround experience with the best quality, pass on this one."
2,Good Sound...when it's working,"While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else."
1,Don't buy the this system!!!,Don't buy this system if you are truly looking for surround sound! The system sounds great but its just not surround sound. You can't feel the bass like other home theaters systems. I have a small living room and even at maximum volume it really didn't get that loud. The second day I had the system it froze with a rental DVD in it. I could not get the DVD out!!! I had to buy a replacement DVD for the video store. Thank god I bought it from Sears with their no haggle return policy. After spending all that money I expected something better from Bose.
3,"Simple, but that's it","We got our Bose 3-2-1 about 6 months ago. Overall, it's pretty good. It was easy to setup and the sound quality is good.You'll like this system if: you want something easy to setup, you want a complete audio entertainment system with high quality (not excellent) sound, you want to be able to play CDs and DVDs.You won't like this system if: you want true surround sound, you want a headphone jack, you want to play DVDs that you create with your PC (including VCDs, DVD+Rs, etc - the only DVD it plays is the kind you buy), you want a home stereo that has high volume, you want your universal remote to work with it.If Bose made some very basic improvements, they would have a great system, including:* Support all homemade DVD formats* Have the volume range higher* Add a headphone jack (better yet, have a wireless port for wireless headphones)* Include a universal remote (or make their remote compatible with universal remotes)"
2,Watch Out!,"I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology. But there is a reason this item is discontinued. It locks up when playing certain DVDs. Sometimes after selecting ""play movie"" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say ""Bad Disc"" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing. You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system.Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know. But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule."
4,Making Faces for years,This book was an absolute favorite of my children and now I am buying it for my grandchildren. It was amazingly in wonderful condition - much better than the one I had from the kids childhood. Thanks for sending it soooo promptly.
2,"Interesting and fun pictures, but too scary for children.","When I was a kid, I loved books that had their pages cut into stips because it was creative fun. For example, you could create your own animal (legs of a pig, body of a bird, head of an elephant) and then with the flip of a page, the whole thing changed again. The book, Making Faces, does that with a face. It starts out with a lady, then a man, another woman, and by the end of the book it's to scary people with pointed tonges, tattoos, and safety-pin earings. The book is very creative and the artwork is excellent, however, I would not recomend it for kids. Making part-man, part-female faces and part-conservative, part-almost satanic features into one face belongs in the adult section, not the kids. It was almost too discusting and disturbing for me. I would love to see a book by the same author/artist that is better directed towards children! Teenagers in today's world would probably love it."
1,Totally inappropriate,"The horror of some of the pictures is absolutely ridiculous. The author could have made just as many ""funny"" or ""silly"" pictures without being disturbing and grotesque. This is not appropriate for anyone. It could possible give young children horrible ideas and could end up hurting themselves or others."
1,KEEP LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ITEM,"This product only took a few seconds to SEND IT BACK. The handle is heavy and bulky. The attached cord is heavy. This combination makes it almost impossible to use at certain angles without it being too uncomfortable. The handle shakes when the power is on making your hand vibrate as well. A very bad design. I requested a refund by Chair Envy and had to submit a description for the return. After they approved my return, I spent $15 on shipping and confirmation then Chair Envy refunded $37 of the $45.95 that I originally paid, waiving the restocking fees for me. After their receipt was confirmed, my return request was closed with no notification of a refund. I submitted an email to Amazon (which by the way, Amazon, has one of the best customer service centers I've experienced). Not happy at all with the product. UPDATE: I purchased the ""Human Touch Acuvibe Personal Massager"" and will provide an review of that upon receipt."
5,Why did you give it one star?,"Well, it seems like the below (or is it above)....well...previous viewer's rating didn't match their review at all. As usual, this is another amazing release from constellation, and guess what? It has lyrics! Hey, what a surprise, and it works great. Anyway, someone else help me out to amend the one star rating, since this is a truly great record, or EP if you like.While being rather short this record is a fantasic piece all to itself. Fantastic packaging as usual from constellation, highest recommendation for a small piece of something so soothingly fixating."
1,a nice piece of music,"ive recently become a huge fan of constellation records and kranky records. however it is so hard to find small labels or music that isnt radio kill. when i first read of this band i thought they would be interesting. the first track alone, gold dust made me fall in love with them. it is sorta like godspeed but with words and little strings. but lots of nice mellow guitar. if your not a huge fan of godspeed, i wouldnt bother with this. however, its still a good one."
1,Time traveling pedophilia,"Filth and trash right from the first few pages in which the ""angel's"" pick up kisses his three year old son's penis and encourages the ""angel"" to do the same and the angel does so, with enthusiasm. Shocked, I skimmed ahead a few pages only to find a scene in which the pick up turns into a three year old and sex STILL continues. This is pedophilia masquerading as erotic gay time travel. I am disgusted by the content as well as by any gay author providing ammunition to anti-gay hysteria that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. I am returning this book to Amazon and although I stopped as soon as it became clear that I was reading a fantasy written by NAMBLA, I only wish I could wipe my mind clean of this story. If I could give it negative 1 million stars, I would."
2,YAWN,"I felt the eroticism was trivial and dull. The storyline is scattered. Angels that are hustlers? Give me a break! Was it suppose to shock. How long did this book take to write? One night, maybe two. Was a template used? I couldn't even feel anything for the characters. This story doesn't acheive anything. Really! Not even a fair fantasy. I would even go so far as to say it is an over-the-hill reminesence of days-gone-by."
4,Angel Lust,"Excellent book, a little challenging at first but once you become accustom to switching centuries, it really holds your attention. It would be a great book to begin a series with about Tom & Bert."
4,I don't know much...,"But I do know this works in a Dell Dimension 3000, and I've been told I wouldn't find anything for it. So hey, you want a graphics card for your Dell Dimension 3000 it wouldn't hurt to try this one. Works for me."
2,He thinks hes great. He wants you to think so too.,"I read this book for an essay on the democratization of Poland and, quite frankly, it turned me off of the man and all of his work in the movements toward a democtratic Poland (Solidarity, etc). While I can appreciate his good deeds, this book is pomopous and self important... the memoirs of a self-satisfied, SUPER-religious conservative, a book filled with 'touching' pictures of the mustachioed man smiling into the camera while shaking the hands of many important people: ""myself and the dear so and so"". It is hard to read this book and still take him seriously."
3,Asphalt urban,This game is somewhat fun. The 2 problems I see with this game is that it very much repeats itself. I also do not like the graphics of the females. I would not recommend this for children.
1,Highly Inappropriate,"My daughter received this game for Christmas. It has an ""Everyone 10+"" rating but I was shocked to see the suggestive content in this game. The appearance of the ""Pussycat Dolls"" at the end of the race should have awarded this game the ""Mature"" rating. Ladies dressed in racy bras and suggestive poses don't need to be included in games that are targeted for kids in the 10 year plus age group. I am returning the game and will be highly skeptical of the ESRB content ratings from this point forward."
2,Terrible sound quality,"I bought this album because I'm a fan of Langhorne Slim. Unfortunately, the recording quality is very poor. Other than that, I like it."
4,Very well done,"I love this CD. ""Big Boss Man"" & ""It Hurts Me Too"" are incredible. Don't listen to sour reviews that want the same old sounds - these are very good renditions, not a re-hashed same old version as the Dead did"
1,Bleagh!!,"Thrown together junk with 'artists' you've never heard of.Stick with David Gans' productions like his ""Stolen Roses"" or ""Might as Well...the Persuasions sing the Greatful Dead"" or ""Postcards of the Hanging - Grateful Dead Perform the Songs of Bob Dylan"".This one didn't make it through a whole listen, though. Dustbin fodder."
1,Don't Buy This!,"I've followed the Dead since 1968. This cd has nothing of the Dead's spirit in it. Furthermore, as a blues enthusiast and player, I find this really lousy blues music-amateurish in the worst sense.For wonderful Dead tribute music: Fire on the Mountain (reggae) and vols. 1 & 2 of Pickin' on the Grateful Dead (bluegrass, of course).Mike"
5,Retro Stainless Stovetop Percolator,This is a great coffee pot! It's very well made and makes wonderful coffee. The service in shipping was super. It was delivered ahead of schedule. That's above and beyond normal.
3,Okay,This video has a couple nice ideas on drills but it is mainly for little league kids. I coach high school varsity baseball and I didn't pick up a lot of things that I can/will use in practice.
2,There all Beta 1's,"In attempting to explain why I disliked this book, I found that there are too many reasons to list. The first being that it doesn't really teach the C# language (instead starting with several chapters that explain why object-oriented programming is important). Second, it doesn't teach Object-oriented programming, since those first few chapter are only about why you'll want to use that programming method. Third, it's not a beginner, intermediate or advanced guide, so who is it really for? Finally, and this is the saddest point, it's the best of the six beta books that I've read so far. So, if only to save others from wasting as much time and money as I have - I'd suggest waiting until a few new books hit the market."
3,"Should be ""Introduction to C#""","A nice easy read, if you have any OOP experience.Covers all the important basics of the C# language itself. Do not expect to find coverage on other .NET Framework components in this book - I guess this is defendable.The book title is somehow misleading. There isn't much ""inside"" topics discussed, except the discussion of GC and the MSIL.If the title is ""Introduction to C#"", I'd give it 4 stars!"
5,Good introduction to C#,This book has everything you need to start programming in C#. It covers the basics as well as some advanced topics on C# programming. Excellent book.
4,Very Good Start for Understanding Concepts and Techniques.,The Author has description for narrating the Concepts and it is well organized. Especially he has covered topics like Attributes and Interfaces. You have to pay a close attention to highlight the hidden important notes/rules. (He should have put those lines on BOLD). Other wise this is a very good book to start learning C#. This book also has a softcopy of the entire book that I found very useful. I would definitely recommend this book.Lawrence ParanidharanIL - USA
4,A good C# book right from the horses's mouth,"Although many people always want to dislike any book Microsoft publishes you have to realize one unargueable thing: It's the best source of official information, especially if you are studying towards a MS certification.With that said I can say this book will help you learn C# but it probably isn't the best way to learn if you've never written C# or C/C++ code bofer as you might want to pick another book such as ""C# Step by Step"" which is alos by MS publishing."
3,Disapointed,"When I bought this book, I was expecting to get a good reference in C# and begin switching to that language. What a disapointment! After having read the first 100 pages, I am wondering if I have not thrown my money through the window ( but that would not be the first time, as good computer books are rare to find ): some keywords are introduced without any explanation ( i.e. get, set) and some concepts are not correctly introduced through the examples ( i.e. sealed classes, ref and out etc.). Moreover, the examples do not correspond to any reality. More than once I was wondering what the author wanted to show. This book obviously lacks visibility and structure."
3,"Way too ""inside""","I really disliked the approach this book took. A good 1/3 of the first chapter discusses the compiler switches and the different sort of libraries/dll/assemblies you can make. The language wasn't presented yet and they are going into different compilation targets?! The other approach they had that I felt was really aweful was using MSIL (.NETs underlying ""assembly language"") as a way to *clearify things*! Every time they presented an involved topic they would show the MSIL to ""explain"" it. Would you read a C++ book that used assembly language to explain things?! There wasnt enough meat for this to be an internals book and there was too much gristle and bones for it to be a developers book."
4,Great introduction to C# !!!,I enjoyed this book and the writing style of the author. This book was my first exposure to C# and made me confortable enough in deciding to proceed with a plan to base a major development project around this language and other aspects of Microsoft.net over the next year.There are plenty of great examples to test and try. Much of the material is discussed in detail.I hope the author has a chance to update this book once the Visual C# moves from beta to a shipping product. And hopefully a few chapters (or entire section) might possibly be devoted to using Visual C# with WinForms.Thanks! ---> Kelsey McClanahan
2,"Some chapters are wonderful, others aren't worth reading","1) Chapters 1 through 11 seem okay, but the rest simply don't make the grade. The chapter on Delegates and Events is too shallow, and some of the claims made by the author are totally incorrect. (for example: ""an event delegate must be defined as taking two arguments"") Strongly recommend skip this chapter altogether, instead, try reading through online doc, which gives a much better definition and explanation.2) User-defined conversion example is horrible, the whole section should be better eliminated than confusing the reader.Bottom line: the authors apparently didn't do their homework well,and just rushed out the book for marketing purposes, so watch out for errors and false statements throughout the book."
3,Entry level.,"Nothing really earth-shaking is this book, basically a primer to C# (at times, it seems like a primer to programming althgether). I think the title may be a little misleading."
4,Great for beginners to C# with C++ experience,This book is great for the C++ programmer looking to make the transition to C#. The book assumes basic programming knowledge and concepts with no previous experience in C#. Covers the basics as well as a few advanced topics. Great for those looking to begin their C# career.
3,Good for intermediate programmers just starting with .NET,"Since I have already read a few C# books, the only thing I liked about this book was the multi-threaded programming chapter.The introduction to Object Oriented programming didn't belong in this book, since most of the rest of the book was aimed at intermediate level developers. Some of the coverage of the C# language also had too much detail for the intermediate level programmer.For learning about C#, you are better off with ""A Programmer's Introduction to C#"" by Eric Gunnerson. For learning about .NET you are better off with ""Introducing .NET"" from Wrox."
5,"Does one thing, and does it well","This book is the best book yet on C#. It is not meant to be a complete overview of the .NET Framework.As a C++ programmer I was most interested in how interfaces are described and implemented. The book provides many good examples. The examples are short and trivial, which is a nice way to demonstrate language features without bogging you down in details.Libraries (such as WinForms) are not documented here. As an experienced developer I am more interested in the language constructs anyway. Library documentation is something that I'm used to studying separately, and, more importantly, it's constantly changing at this early beta stage."
4,Good overview,"good overview of post modernism. very informative, it talks about many of the key issues in fairly decent detail."
2,Couldn't understand it,"I had to read this book for a communications class. It's about postmodernism. I didn't know anything about that subject before I read the book, and I know nothing about that subject now that I've been forced to read it. The layout is very interesting, but the text is way too hard for a non-philosophy or non-art person like myself to understand. I need plain English, and this wasn't it."
2,"NOT FOR 4 YEAR OLDS This is a tiny book and not regular paper doll, The doll is printed on back and clothes are stickers.","the costumes are cute why 2 stars. The books is only 4"" wide and 5 plus"" tall. The paper doll is a picture printed on the inside of the back cover. She is 4"" tall,a nd does nto stand alone she is just a picture on the page. the clothes and accessories are stickers. You are supposed to reuse the sitckers but need to replace them onthe pages you take them form.. Mine never wnated to stick back well and some got lost,. Others did not want to stick to pager more than 2 times. No for small ones. this is for at least 6 and up age."
5,Geography Genius - Royal Road to Romance by Richard Halliburton,"Richard Halliburton exudes genuine passion for adventure and it shows in his writings. He makes geography come alive as he writes of his exciting travels throughout the world via ships, railways, hiking, hitching rides on freight trucks and the like, as well as a variety of other ingenious methods. His vigor, youth and insatiable appetite for discovery make for a superb read all while educating the reader in geography with a little help from a globe or atlas.He travels from New York to Hamburg, the Matterhorn, France, Andorra, Alhambra, Gibralter, Monte Carlo, the Nile, and on and on he goes. In this most definite living book, no ordinary, boring geography facts will be found. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Facts are wrapped in beautiful, literary language and presented as extraordinary gifts."
2,Highly One-sided,"Shrill, mistaken in some details, very unbalanced. Not what I expect from an ""expert"". Save your money."
5,Excellent filter,Purchased the unit last year and this was my first purchase of a spare filter.. I love this unit and would recommend it anytime
5,Simplicity Clear Breeze,I bought a Simplicity Clear Breeze hepa from the salvation army. It actually looks like one of the newer surround air except it isnt as elaborate. I looked on the internet for filters for it and found they were $50-60 other places. This one looked identical and the dimensions were close enough that I figured I give it a try! It worked and when you subscribe the filters are pretty cheap compared to whats out there. If you go to walmart or places that sell hepa like filters they are almost the same price. These filters are the real deal. Me and my daughter have BAD allergies and this thing allows me to completely stop using my Zyrtec or claritan!
5,Surround Air Multi Filter Air Purifier,"The Surround Air filter replacement meets all expectations and is exactly what I ordered and requested . My old one was at least 5 years old and needed replacing badly although it was still efficient but not to full capacity . I received the Surround Air Purifier when I purchased a vaccumn cleaner and have been quite pleased with it, it is an outstanding product . My son helped me go online to order a new filter . The filter not only lasts a long time but is very efficient and priced reasonably ."
2,Not so great,"This book is a thumb-nail reference for ideas to enrich the lives of those with Alzheimer's or other senile dementing disorders. However, as a professional therapist, I find the ideas rather involved. I believe these ideas are more appropriate for primary caregivers and family. As someone who visits ALFs, I'd have to have a HUGE bag of tricks to accomplish most of these activities (and each tailored to the individuals' pasts)."
2,Too basic,Far too basic for any professional or experienced caregiver. Perhaps a basic introduction for a family member but if any reading has been done these ideas have likely been seen already.
1,Don't waste your money or time,I returned this book the day I got it. It is like reading a book for play activiies for a 2 year old. I was somewhat insulted by the book and did not even venture to share it with my family as was my plan.
4,"Fun, but not always wondrous","Bowler has compiled another interesting collection of words, with amusing commentary on them. While there is some repetition of common-root words (e.g., morology, morosis), and not all of these words seem particularly arcane (e.g., natatorium, zeitgeist), this book would be of use to the RUPTUARY aspiring to TAPINOSIS, and enjoyable for the rest of us."
1,TV Themes after lovin,Have not received my copy as of 12/1/2012 My order was placed in Nov 2011 So I cannot comment on this CD
2,Not as nicely made as I was expecting but still a fun game,"I had high hopes for the quality of the game as a coffee table/conversation piece. However the quality of the construction does not appear to match the description. the ""lustrous stained finish"" turned out to not apply to the inner grooves which were only were partially and unevely stained. I haven't discovered the brass fittings mentioned in the description either"" Though the game is fully playable if you overlook the cosmetic issues."
3,Abrupt end,"I found the book an enjoyable read even though the authors' writing was a bit trite and simplistic. It did lack some flow in areas as the writers simply jumped from vignette to vignette, albeit they were all fairly entertaining. My biggest criticism is that the authors seemed to have lost interest in finishing the book. After taking us through several centuries of relevant history, approximately 60 pages was devoted to the plight of Champagne/champagne during WWI (which was, in my opinion, appropriate). However, only about 8 pages accounted for the WWII years, and then....the end! Apparently, there have been no new or interesting developments in Champagne / of champagne during the past six decades. I find this hard to believe, and is thus my biggest disappointment with the book."
5,Every drinker should read this,"A truely amazing history for both the area, the people and the drink.I now agree with their claim that only wine grown and produced there may use the name ""Champagne"""
3,Bubbling over!,"This book is well written, informative and witty. It is well-sourced, but the actual references are relegated to the end of the book. The style is like listening to a very knowledgeable, engaging person talk about a subject he/she loves."
2,One Word: Trite,"Since the reviews seem to be divided into love or hate for this book, I figured I'd add my two cents. The content is interesting enough (though I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on the dubious factuality of the authors' anecdotes), but the writing is just insufferable. It is trite, lazy, and obnoxious."
5,collectible.,"Good little car for a Shelby Cobra lover. I bought it for my cousin as a gift and he loved it. A lot of detail put into it, great collectible."
3,50 Plus Easy Classical Solos for Flute,This is a really good flute book and it has loads of different pieces to play by loads of different composers. It comes with some useful information abuot playing the fulte and also about each piece. All in all I thought it was a really good buy and great value for money and I think the only bad point about it was that it was a bit restricted in the pieces it had in it as it would be ok for beginners but more advanced players might find it a bit hard
1,Inferior version,"This is an inferior version of the film. Bad print quality, bad continuity (missing scenes so it's impossible to follow the story), odd choice of music. This version (Madacy) is far inferior to the Restored Authorized Edition from Kino Video."
2,"Pretty, pretty defunct","The watch is a great looking watch but it's brought more headaches then compliments. The time constantly falls behind. Apparently, the more you wear it the more accurate the time will be. I always wear my watch and it still shows me the wrong time and date. It's cool that the date shows up in shorthand Spanish or English, but it doesn't allow for you to set it the way you want it to, either. I also had looked up this model after purchase on the Croton website, but could not find ANY information on it. It took me a while after playing with it to figure out to change the settings on it, Amazon did not provide decent instructions for care."
4,"Small, readable and very informative","For such a slim volume it contained very interesting, detailed, information about Washington's life and views. I've read thicker tomes and not felt that I got as much about his views on issues. Very readable."
3,Quick Read but not sure its worth the Price,I flew through this book and found it interesting but at only 144 pages I am not sure the $16 plus price tag is worth it. What is the justification for this when other books on the same subject matter with double the information can be had for the same price or just little higher? I would recommend reading this book if you get it for between $5 and $10. Again I liked the book but don't feel the price is worth it.
4,Pretty decent tool,"Works pretty well after getting used to how it functions. Not great for small gauge wire unless you score the insulator some first, so it doesn't just rip the whole wire."
2,Less than thrilled,"Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm not real happy with these wire strippers. Several people I know swear by them, but I'm not a convert. I do a lot of data cabling with 24 and 26 gauge stranded wire and this tool just seems to mangle the wire, not even cleanly cutting the insulation. It's important when stripping wires for data connectors that you are accurate with the length of insulation removed - it's practically impossible to do that with the fast action recommended for using these.Others might be happy with them, and maybe they're great for heavier wire or less accurate applications, but they just leave a mess behind for me."
1,hp pavilion bundled software(software bundle),"hp was given to be for x-mas and buy the time I opened it and set it up the 30day software coverage was over and the 15day return to store was over,and I reg the computer with hp but forgot(didnt see)the small box the reg it with microsoft,and never saw it again,and found that the key code didnt match,for me none of the few booklets about the software or hardware matched and were of little help,and the rebate had expired dec31,I was not at all happy that the windows xp preloaded didnt come with the cd,no recover cd,no back software,and it was anything but easy to sign up for internet unless it was the one preinstalled,I can not get dsl,and loading your cd from a provider doesnt work,or is very difficult,so I would just say relly look into whats installed really installed and look to see everything in the box,cables,speakers,booklets,cds,warranty,most of all the languge and country you want to use it in,and the speed is not what its says"
4,Nice rare release,"Nice rare and hardly heard release, this is before his near fatal accident so he sounds different here than on current albums"
3,The Photographs are the book,"When the front cover flap says ""text offers a basic introduction to the Northweest Coast culture"" put the emphasis on basic, very basic. The value of the book is in the photographs. This book includes not only old work and recent work but even work in progress. It includes petroglyphs, masks, dugouts, baskets, jewlery, totel poles, rattles, spoons i.e. a full introduction to the material culture. It also includes photographs of the region allowing one to envision the physical space in which the Native Americans lived.I find the book as a whole much more like a tour of a well-planned musuem display than like an art book. As such it is enjoyable."
4,Very pleasing album in unexpected format,"As a Zombies fan it was about time I got this and I'm glad I did. The details have been gone over already so no need to go there but I did want to be added to the list of those who recommend. Standouts IMO are ""She Loves The Way They Love Her"" ""Caroline Goodbye"" and ""Misty Roses"". The first two are in the Zombie tradition of poppy rock sounding but much classier than the average, and MR is an extended mellow acoustic with some nice and unexpected turns...really a great track.Speaking of mellow I should mention that this album is very laid back...it's nicely done but the two rock tunes I mentioned, while great, almost seem out of place or is it that the other tracks contrast too much in their acoustic atmosphere?The good thing is it doesn't matter since it's all good, but I did want to mention it is mostly a fairly quiet album, but again, nothing wrong with that. Colin's vocals are excellent throught, BTW. Enjoy!TB"
4,I Was A Teen-Aged Zombie,"""The Voice"" of many memorable 1960's pop hits for England's Zombies (""She's Not There"", ""Tell Her No""), Colin Blunstone continues in the vein of that band's 1969 swansong, the artsy ""Odyssey & Oracle"" with this 1971 solo offering. Indeed, the same breathy, haunting melancholy that stamped the song ""Time Of The Season"" so indelibly in listener's minds seems to inform most of this album. Blunstone goes for Baroque with lush string arrangements and lots of acoustic classical guitar strumming on beautifully arranged cuts like Tim Hardin's ""Misty Roses"" and his own Brian Wilson-esque ""Caroline Goodbye"". If you enjoy contemporary artists like Eric Matthews, Nick Heyward and the Pernice Brothers, this ""roots"" chamber pop album will be a pleasant discovery."
5,"Really nice shoes, stylish and classy","I love these shoes. I wished i could have bought two of them b/c I have twin boys. They are so cute , they fit comfortably and they are nice to look at and easy for my toddler to use. Definitely recommend them!"
4,She likes it!,"Nice piece, I have seen comparable pieces a bit less expensive, but I had to have it shipped and this was a good option."
2,it's ok,"the turner is fine but honestly i never use it... its heavy and makes a lot of noise.. I purchased the spoon as well and don't use themquality is good i guess, but i prefer the silicone type or just plain cheep plastic ones, you can get from any store.. i was dissapointed frankly. It was a mistake to get them..."
3,Lang's Indian Epic,"The American video release of director Fritz Lang's two-part Indian epic has finally arrived. Admittedly, ""The Indian Tomb"" (1959) is not among Lang's finest achievements, but it remains a visually stunning, imaginative work - far superior to the slow-paced first installment, ""The Tiger of Eschnapur."" Except for Debra Paget's exotic beauty, one wishes Lang had assembled a stronger cast for his atmospheric adventure. In addition, the film suffers from some hokey passages involving our ineffectual hero. Still, the film's vivid color photography, architectural compositions and lavish sets are unique in cinema history. Paget's erotic cobra dance, the cave of lepers, and action-filled climax represent Lang at his best. Despite its flaws, the director's Indian saga ranks with ""Metropolis"" as his most ambitious production."
2,Love the Features but ..........................,"This cordless phone/answering machine is packed with great features and a great price! The 4 mailboxes, caller id, directory are really great and very well thought out features. The setup was easy and quite easy to configure for my needs. Where this product falls short is in the quality of the cordless connection. It has a lousy range, none of the channels tried resulted in a clear connection. I plan to return it. Seems like a case of adding bells and whistles to an old car and trying to set a transcontinental speed record."
1,No Manual,I received no manual with this phone and cannot find anywhere in the web to get another one.
3,6 in 1 hammer,I bought this hammer because my roommate owns it and I love it. However the handle on the one I bought was stripped so it will not tighten. The flowers on the one I bought also did not match the picture. I'm sure this is probably just by chance and most others that people order work just fine.
4,artsy multi use hammers,"Bought two, one for each of my girls. They love them. Its good to have a hammer for the house for little things. Most of all, they look pretty."
5,6 in 1 flower hammers,I love the 6 in 1 flower hammers!! They are of really good quality. I brought them for administrative assistant's appreciatation week and I am sure that they will love them too. I will buy more.6 in 1 Flower Hammer
2,This one Disappoints Dietz fans!,"What happended? For those that have followed this series we have always been able to see the Legion do their best work when the pressure is on and the stakes are high. This time I felt dissapointed and let down. My expectations were high and I was really waiting for it to all come together and then a big ""poof""All done, go home everyone? Sorry, But, that doesn't cut it for me. I have read Dietz because he has always delivered, Fast paced action, exceptional technology and a host of great charaters that make the Legion special. They are usually facing a dangerous & seriously competent enemy.If anything it would seem that this book was an attempt at an easy way out to end the series. It seems that he was rushed and needed a quick ending. The result is a couple of interesting books that had some potential and then a let down."
4,change of stile,The first two books about the legion was very heavy on the cyborgs. I liked the style in which Dietz told the transformation from human to cyborg. Now the last two books have been more political than HC-scfi fi!
4,Excellent Story...the ending is a bit tidy,"Dietz's Legionnaire series is top notch, and By Force of Arms is a great addition to the series. His writing is effective and captivating. But one thing...gotta get a proof reader! There are dozens of grammatical and surface errors that occasionally detract from the reading. Other than that and the tidy ending, it's a great book. Bring on the Ramanthians!"
4,Good Product! Batteries?????,I have had this kit almost two years and use it regularly in the construction trade. It works great. I love the cordless reciprocating saw. My only complaint is the longevity of the batteries. I had to replace my batteries after 15 months. Fortunately I was able to get a great deal on a two pack on Amazon. If I had purchased them at Home Depot I would have been out almost $200. I love Amazon. I also have a Rigid Cordless kit which works just as well and has a lifetime warranty which includes the batteries. I will probably buy Rigid in the future and Home Depot usually has great deals around Christmas time.
2,save ur $$$,"Ihave owned this set for almost 2 years now, the tools are great!! HOWEVER the batteries suck, have no life n dont hold a charge well. Save yourself a lot of fristration, buy the DeWalt if u want NiCad or any of the ""big boys' in Lith-Ion. I just spent $200 to buy the lith Ion v18s from milwaulkee to go with my tools.............."
3,"Nice, but fast and brief","This video is nice, but goes very fast and not much depth to it, more like a crash course overview of the thing. Great audio and video. Definitely begginer level so don't bother if you are past that stage."
4,Theme: Live life to the fullest and be happy.,"This book wasn't the best Remarque book that I've read. In short it is about a race car driver, Clerfayt, who falls in love with a terminal ill patient, named Lillian. She finds a new lease on life after leaving the sanatorium with Clerfayt. Clerfayt leads a risky life on the edge, where as Lillian has lead a quiet, ""safe"" life in an attempt to be cured. Realizing her time is growing short, she feels she is ready for a big change.Their roles reverse as the course of the book plays out, each gaining insight to the fallacies of the other person's lifestyle. Remarque throws a lot of wit and wisdom in the conversations and thoughts, which to me didn't seem normal. However, Remarque's characters, in all of his books, tend to be deep and thoughtful.Overall, though, it was enjoyable departure from his typical WW2 books. Worth reading, but he has other better ones."
1,Poor Quality and Craftsmanship,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift. I would be embarassed to give this to someone. The heart was mis-shaped and flawed with rough edges and uneven finish. Will not exchange as I feel the quality is so poor. It is not stamped .925. It is stamped ""Sterling"". Very disappointed."
3,Good as a first introduction to Jefferson,"Having not read the unabridged version of this biography, I cannot compare this volume to it. But Padover was certainly an authority of the first order on the man and this volume is crammed with plenty of facts. Like Douglas Freeman's Washington, however, there are no negatives to be found in Padover's Jefferson. All the players in the story wear either a pristine white hat or a muddy black one and this can often be distracting to those who desire an unbiased account (especially of the Federalist/Republican tug of war). On the whole, however, this edition will surely be of help to those who are interested in a brisk yet detailed introduction to Jefferson."
2,Mixed feelings,"I have read the unabridged version of this book and would agree with the review above from J. Sharp. If you are looking for an unbiased, objective view of Jefferson, you will probably want to pass on this book. Padover finds few faults in the subject and almost makes excuses for his shortcomings to the point of just being silly. There are so many contradictions, some in the same paragraph, that I started wondering what was fact and what was just Padover's opinion. It became annoying and I found myself almost disliking Jefferson because of the author. I'll have to read a more modern biography I think, from a different author, before I form my own opinion of Jefferson."
5,A Good Action Series,"This contains the first and 100th story in the Nick Carter - Killmaster series, bringing back an old character from the Dime Novels and updating him into the then current times. The early stories especially were fun, and Run Spy Run is no exception. Two exciting adventures of super spy, The Killmaster, Nick Carter!"
2,Hell's Bells #1,"Most soundscape recordings are of a time & place, an environment for listening based on local ambience. Steven Feld's three bell CDs are different -- each one is a series of sound effects recordings tied together by only one theme -- bells.There are church bells. There are herds of sheep wearing bells. There are bells on clothing. Ceremonial bells. Musical bells. Cow bells. Bells on trucks. Windchime bells. And not just short samples either, most of the recordings are 8-11 minutes.These are the kind of recordings a person into sampling might buy, or a person making a movie soundtrack. They're not even remotely usable as CDs you might listen to for enjoyment."
2,I tried it but...,"I've always seen Mr. Aldiss on the bookseller shelves. I firgured that an author with such staying power deserved a try out on the Kindle freebie list. However, I could not finish the book. The hero may have matured with the story but I lost interest in what I considered to be a bleak depiction of our future society and their forms of research and amusement. I admit I'm more a fan of bright optimism."
5,This is one of those rare books...,"...that you remember forever, in a vague dreamlike way. I was in my teens when I first read it, then again in my twenties, and finally in my thrirties the original UK version. But it wasn't the book that changed so much, it was the world. Get your ticket punched with Cryptozoic and then start counting, reverse forward."
4,Copco 4-8 cup polished stainless steel stovetop percolator,"This product does the job, makes coffee on the stove just like mom used to make."
3,Part needed,"Does anyone know where I can find another spring for my percolator? Mine fell into the disposal...need I say more? I would appreciate any ideas of where to look for this part as I hate to think I've lost the whole pot over one little spring.Thanks,Joy"
4,Copco Percolator,"At first we were disappointed with this coffee pot because the second time we used it the lid fell off while pouring hot coffee, but after we adjusted the prongs holding the lid in place, we've never had that problem again. It makes a delicious cup of coffe, and best of all we no longer have another electric appliance cluttering up our limited kitchen counter space. My only complaint is that the cup markings on the outside of the pot are useless because they do not show up on the inside of the pot where it matters as you fill the pot with water."
4,Mother's gift,Bought this for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loves it. She is a traditionalist and doesn't like most of the newer coffee makers/pots. It reminds her of being in her mother's kitchen. It works wells and make a great pot of coffee.
5,"Inexpensive, highly functional, excellent value!","For what little money this costs, you can't beat it. Well designed, easy to clean, easy to use, and makes great perked coffee! If the plastic percolator top has you on the fence, remember you can get a glass replacement for around $2. We have a gas stove, and unlike another review states, we've found that if you adjust the flame just slightly you get a perfect sized flame for the percolator.Overall, you're not going to find a more sturdy workhorse for the $10 this is currently listed at. Get this, save your money, and spend it on a good grinder (way more important for great coffee!)"
4,Overall - Pretty Good,"Overall - Pretty GoodThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there are no fill level marks on the inside of the percolator. The fill marks are stamped on the outside of the percolator, under the handle, and are unusable. It took a few pots to figure out the right fill level. Other than that, it works great. It makes coffee quickly and the coffee tastes great. It works much better than any electric coffee maker I've used."
2,2 weeks and it broke,"There is a spring that is spot welded to the stem that is suppose to hold up the peculator basket. With in 2 weeks the welds gave out and the basket now slides all the way to the bottom of the stem and sits in the coffee. Up until that point it was making great coffee. Most other stems I have seen, flare our to stop the basket from sliding down, but I guess this design saves about 2 cents per pot."
5,Best Coffee Ever,We've been using this stove top percolator for about a month now. We bought it to replace an electric percolator that we had. It took some getting use to in the beginning. Biggest difference and only downside from the electric percolator is does take about 20 to 30 minutes to perk the coffee. The upside is the coffee is really hot. I usually let mine sit for 5 minutes before taking my first sip. I would definitely recommend this to someone wanting to change from auto-drip coffee makers or electric percolators.
4,small,the hippo is cool but it is smaller then u think. in the pic it looks bigger then it really is.
5,Loved this vendor's service,"This CD was sent out promptly and arrived in a bomb proof package. I couldn't have been happier with the vendor or CD. The vendor followed up to be sure I was happy with service and product. I will buy from this vendor again. The CD was ""new"" just as stated in ad."
4,Interesting read,"Ukigumo is Japan's first modern novel, and it is fascinating to read. Modern Japanese literature has a compressed development, and it started here. The translation is very good.Don't get me wrong, this is a strong novel with a good story. But it is more than worth reading just for the history."
1,not worth buying,We bought one and got it home only to find out the built in DVD player wouldn't load DVDs. Took it back to store and got another one. The remote did not fully work on the new one but kept it anyway. My mistake. After three months the DVD player kept a rental DVD and will not eject it. Mintek said to ship it to them and they will fix in 4-6 weeks. Unit will not even switch to TV mode with DVD player hung up so we can't even use as a TV.Avoid this unit (and I suspect all Mintek products).
1,Very poor video controls for aspect ratio,"Upon first receiving this product, the video and sound were good. Immediately noticed that their manual was poorly written and did not explain some of the controls at all. There appeared to be only 2 aspect ratio settings: the normal 4:3 and too wide.After about 2 months, finally got around to playing a 4:3 aspect DVD and found that the display is stretched horizontally, resulting in fat people. None of the controls will do anything to fix the aspect ratio - the zoom only makes the images bigger.Sent a message regarding these issues to Mintek's tech support 2 months ago with no reply.Conclusion: the hardware is okay but the software and documentation are very poor. Mintek has a long way to go before they will have a quality product. I seriously doubt that I will ever buy any Mintek product ever again."
2,Major Audio Problems,"I purchased this product after an exhaustive search four months ago and am very frustrated. Some days, it plays DVDs without any trouble. On days like today, it has major audio glitches which make DVDs unwatchable. I'll hear a high-pitched whine, tinny/muted sound, or absolutely no sound at all. This does not seem to affect its ability to play VHS tapes. I haven't even tried to record yet, since I don't want to waste recordable DVDs and find out there is no sound on those, either. I'm now faced with the prospect of repairing a very new product, which I will have to pay a lot to ship since there is no repair facility in my area. Is this one just a lemon? I know I wouldn't buy it again if given the chance."
5,Highly recommend this SONY RDR,"This product does an excellent job of transfers of VHS video tape material on to a DVD.You have control of all elements of transfer. Of course the higher the quality the less space/time you have on each DVD- it does not require the ""highest quality or HQ"" setting in order to get a very clear image. This is more for the transfer of home recordings, which is what I wanted it for. You cannot copy most commercially recorded VHS format tapes onto DVD. This equipment allows for the direct transfer of material from a Sony Video Camera tape onto a DVD, again with total control of editing the material at the point of transfer."
5,Electroinc Purchase,"Product was exactly what was wanted and arrived in excellent condition in a very short period of time. Directions that came with the product could have been a little more detailed, but that is a problem with the manufacturer."
2,Pretty much useless...,"...for transferring VHS to DVD, I'd recommend something else. This unit is crap.The dubbing function results in a lot of weird stops and starts. Your video programs will end up chopped up into random chunks, because the machine can't seem to operate for more than 5 to 35 minutes at a stretch without pausing and ""regrouping."" Also, quality-wise, the finalized DVDs look terrible.You could avoid the mess by using this machine's VCR function only for playback, recording DVDs on a different external unit. This results in a better disc (depending, of course, on your recorder). However, Sony's brilliant designers saw fit to have a huge, intrusive ONSCREEN DISPLAY pop up from the playback VCR wherever there is a hint of disrupted signal, tracking problem, imperfect stereo, ANYTHING. There is, of course, no way to turn the onscreen display off. So if your source videos aren't factory-perfect, forget about it.I hate this thing."
2,2nd machine down,This is the second Sony dvd/combo unit (RDRVX) series unit to fail in two years. This series seems to have many problems. As of now I am EXTREMELY reluctant to purchase another one. Also it has rendered unusable two straight dvd-r discs of recordered shows. Now it is beginning to state that parts of tv shows are copy right protected movies! It is now( Dec. ) stating that the dvd discs are full after 1-2 recordings. This no matter how much is left on the disc!
4,Dubbing Problems on older VX530's,"I own two VX-530's and use them with DVD+R and DVD+RW discs to compile recordings of series from TIVO and VHS tapes. Up until recently, I have had very few problems with the recorders. Lately, however, one of them had presented problems when attempting to name a chapter on the DVD+R discs. Occasionally, I can get it to work after returning to the System Menu or naming the disc but often I have to do either an eject/load on the disc or power off/on the entire recorder before it will allow me to write the new chapter name. I don't have the problem when using DVD+RW discs. Despite this glitch, I have been very satisfied with the VX-530 and have logged over 500 recording hours. I have also watched all manner of pre-recorded DVD's without any noticeable problems."
1,DVD Drive was DOA,"I ordered this particular unit SPECIFICALLY because it advertised the ability to read DVD+/-DL discs. Well guess what? It can't read ANYTHING. Factory DVDs don't load. Custom burned discs don't load. Factory CD audio discs don't load. NOTHING loads. I have a $200+ piece of junk that will cost me another $10-$30 to ship back to RMA to SONY. Ordered from Etronics. Verdict is still out on them (their policy is not to take opened-item returns of SONY products). Shipping was in the regular retail box, but I thought it was suspended/packaged respectably from the factory. Bottom line: major headache. Don't take a chance ordering this online. It's not worth the hassle (especially if the damn vendor doesn't take SONY a/v returns!)."
2,I had to see it for myself,"I purchased this unit on 3/7/2007 and returned it the same day. The picture quality is beautiful and it's a Sony, right? Precisely why I returned it. Multiple reviewers complained that the unit will not record from premium cable channels. But I took a chance anyway. I have Cablevision of Long Island, NY and this recorder will not allow a recording to be made from channels such as Starz, Encore, TCM and AMC...it will display a message about copyrighted material. I have a Panasonic and a Samsung dvd recorder....they do just fine on these channels. Sony is notorious for their so called piracy protection designs and if you want to record movies from cable movie channels........absolutely do not buy this recorder!!!"
4,nice...but most of the hard disk is used,"Well it's nice and I needed it...but there is no install CD for it which worries me. Everything (OS, programs etc) is stored on separate partition on the harddrive from which you can restore the system which worries me because what if the disk crashes?And because of this restore partition and all of XP and such...it seems that only like 32gb were on the disk and only 22 free...maybe i'm exaggerating.."
1,Only for home entertainment,"The lack of documentation and no Windows XP CD makes this computer too much of a risk for users who have critical information on their computers. The machine has almost no upgrade potential because the slots are filled and no extra bays.HP Instant Support does not work on my machine. The OEM version of Windows XP Home is not complete (installed by HP before the final version of XP was published) and therefore Microsoft will not support the software, saying that it is HP's responsibility. The telephone support personnel (I've spoken to at least 6) are not very knowledgeable. The mouse and driver included with the computer does not provide scrolling with the wheel in several programs.Recovery disks are said to become available after January 18, 2002 but only if you can prove certain circumstances.The machine is really designed only for playing games and home entertainment. If you need the computer for business and critical information call Dell."
3,Was a great deal for $115,"Picked up this machine used at a neighbors garage sale for fifteen dollars ($15). The seller said she started having problems almost immediately but HP was of little help - pay-per-call phone tech support kept having her restore Windows XP. The store where she purchased it informed her that all her problems would resolve after the machine ""broke in"". It broke, alright... with a hard drive crash just two weeks out of its warrantee.I tested then replaced its defective 40g 5400rpm Samsung SV4002H hard drive with a pair of 20g WD200BB Western Digitals I got off eBay, swapped the 32mb ATI Rage 128 video card out for a (Chaintech) NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 440, upped the RAM to 512, and now, with a total investment of about $115 have a decent email getter.The best part of having a HP 7955 is that the Xandros 2.0 Linux distro installs trouble-free on the first try :-)FWIW, the system runs on a ASUSTeK P4B-LA REV 1.xx motherboard"
1,No restore CDs,"First of all I am not 12, I just didn't want to go thru the signup process and get spammed even more.I would have to advise everyone to stay away from any HP products, the lack of restore CDs is an obvious effort to save a few dollars and at the same time get more money from you when the warranty runs out, and it seriously devalues your significant investment. Buyer be warned, go elsewhere!"
2,windows xp,"i bought a hp7955 with windows xp in october 2001, and had nothing but trouble with every program trying to run it.i spent half of my time on the computer sending problem screens to hp & microsoft and now the hard drive is shuting down, and have no help from either company,installing patches has not help."
5,Exactly as Advertised,"I am not even an Oracle admin, and I found this book to be one of my best resources. I am a Tru64 Unix admin, and this book is a super quick reference (as titled) for everything from disk controllers to system tuning. I love the clean, organized layout of the book, with a chart like summary of commands at the end of each chapter. One of the best computer books I own for sure."
4,Funny adventure,"This is a funny Berenstain Bears adventure book, in which the kids go camping and follow their Bear Scout Guidebook while Papa Bear tries to do everything his way and ends up making a big mess. My 3 y.o. likes this story very much, and asks for it frequently.Like with many other Berenstain Bears books, I like that it teaches the importance of reading to learn stuff, but I find the dad's kluziness a bit annoying as I believe it undermines the respect for parents, cause it's not that it shows that parents can make mistakes too, but that they're totally incapable of doing something right.However, it's a funny story, the adventure has a nice pace to it, and my kid enjoys reading it."
1,Let's Teach Respect Instead,I agree that dad bashing can only be detrimental to a child's view of his parents. Wouldn't it be much better to have a plot that shows how proud the children are of their dad?
4,Very nice basic wireless presenter/mouse,"I use wireless mouses for my job as a trainer. I am always looking for a nice presenter and mouse combined. This is a great presenter at a lower cost. The rubber piece in the middle is the mouse, and it works great, just a tad slower compared to other options. But it does work great, just have to get use to the rubber piece and maneuvering it. The only recommendation I would have is to make the mouse more user friendly, but otherwise it has great battery life and is plug and play which works great going for different classrooms."
1,Good Functions But Bad Range,"I bought this for my classroom and used it a few times. I loved the fact that it has a mouse function and a laser pointer(though it is a very weak laser). However, this product failed to deliver where it's needed the most and that is the range. I'm not sure why the last guy says it works from 40-50 feet but mine was only able to work within 10 feet. I also had to point my presenter directly at the USB device to work. At this range, I might as well walk to the computer to change a slide. Junk."
1,Waste of money,The reception is hit and miss. It does not work unless you are at the right angle and within range (about 10 feet). Spend the extra money and get one of better quality.
2,Should have paid more for more,This was the second remote I bought from Targus and this was cheaper in quality than the first one that I bought. The USB connector literally fell apart in my hands after 3 months of use. I taped it together and it lasted a bit longer. I wish I had spent more for a higher quality product.
5,1 inch x 2 foot lead,"This 2 foot leash is great for taking my dog into pet stores. I wondered if it would be too short as my dog's head just comes to my knee; and I would need to raise my arm to get my pocketbook out of my purse to pay. However, the length worked great. I only had a 6 foot leash before and although I kept my dog at my side, people tended to crowd between us. When I took my dog into the petstore with the 2 foot leash, people did not crowd between us. Also, I could still easily get my checkbook out of my purse with the 2 foot leash looped over my arm. I would highly recommend this to people who want to keep their knee high and larger dogs close while in stores or even being part of a walkathon with many other dogs about."
3,Better to use re-writables instead,"These do what they are supposed to do, but are needlessly expensive. Now I use re-writable disks exclusively. I copy the movies to my computer and author them to regular size DVD's, and reuse the discs."
3,Not enough memory to copy Sony mini DVD-R,"I bought these to make backup copies of my Sony DVD handycam recordings. The only problem is Sony mini DVD-R and mini DVD-RW are 1.37 GB of actual space, while the Maxell are actually 1.36 GB of actual space. Since DVD recordings are somewhat difficult to edit, this effectively means that these are useless for copying the Sony handycam recordings unless you do not completely fill up the Sony mini DVD."
2,Doesn't live up to it's name!,"We own two of these (stocking stuffers for Christmas) and we have tried a ton of different soaps, shampoos and bodywashes all with the same result. No more bubbles than if they had just swirled their hands through the soap. We're disappointed, but they still like cranking the handles even if nothing really happens so it's not a total loss, just don't expect it to make bubbles!!!"
3,Fun but not quite as promised,This sudser doesn't really live up to it's promises but my 3 year old son loves it all the same. The noise and action and fun of spinning it entertains him in the tub and he loves it - but it doesn't really produce alot of bubbles or suds.
2,a little difficult for kids to use and doesn't seem to really produce bubbles,"The idea of the sudser was really neat, but in reality it is difficult to use. The age min. said 18 months, but that is far from accurate. My two year old couldn't make it work and my four year old gave up on it because there was not a significant amount of bubbles produced. I am disappointed because I just expected it to be cooler and more exciting to them, with cost and shipping $16 is a lot for a dud of a toy, especially a bath tub toy!"
1,NOT worth it,"We tried adding the soap and turned the handlle "" really fast"" but it still dosent do much???"
2,Disappointed Kids,"This looked like so much fun when we first opened up the box. In the tub,the kids could not get it to work. I tried and also could not get the ""mountain of bubbles"" to appear. After wasting half a bottle of soap, we had two very disappointed kids and a disgusted grandma. The real old-fashioned egg beater would do a better job."
2,fnc medical,if you go to the fncmedical website you can get the exact same product for Waaay less in shipping. so this sale on amazon is a bit of a ripoff.
4,"Simple, Clean Fun!","In 1958, when I was eight years old, my older cousin was cleaning out his bookcase as I played solitaire on his bed. ""Here,"" He said, handing me a paperback. ""you like this kind of stuff"". It was an Ace double novel - ""Two Complete Novels, 35 cents"". One side was Doomsday Eve, by Robert Moore Williams (forgettable), and the other was Three to Conquer. What impressed me most about this novel was the character development. The hero was not your ordinary lantern-jawed he-man type prevalent at the time; Wade Harper was a squat, hirsute, ape of a man who was contrary enough to have a job developing instruments to manipulate the very small. Oh yeah, he also read minds, which is the catalyst for the story. The plot is simple Bodysnatchers fare, the good guys are good and the bad guys lethal, and you can read it in one evening. I still do. What more can you ask?"
1,Essay . . .,"Sorry, I just don't get it. This book is a long poetic essay about writing styles in the electronic age (I think). It's rather experimental in format and probably couldn't have been published by someone without a famous name. Open it to the table of contents, and you find a page half in pale orange and half in neon green, with white double-grid lines across the page, sort of in a plaid pattern. The table of contents itself is only in one typeface (2 sizes) a remarkable phenomenon in this book. As for the content of the writing, it touches on topics such as virtual reality, teleconferencing, the split of Serbo-Croatian, writing systems of the world, new styles of writing, and synesthesia. If you like reading long-winded philosophical essays written as graphic arts experiments, then this book is for you."
3,VERY rudimentary basics that saving your money is good,"I hesitate to use the word finance since this 30 min dvd barely mentioned the word stocks & doesn't even mention a 401K. This is best for grade school or middle school or those who handle money like them. Most of the content is about knowing if you spend more then you earn, you won't get far. There was about 5 minutes on how investing (doesn't even say in what/how) is better then sitting in your mattress. It's cute, it's not boring, good skits, but won't tell you HOW to invest or how to understand red tape of financial management."
1,Too little content,"I regret buying this dvd, it may be a good 'intro to an intro' to a middle school student. There is nothing in it that cannot be found on the internet for free. I truly believe I wasted my money on this product, unlike some other dvds of Standard Deviants."
5,Shoulder pain,"This is a must have for anyone suffering from shoulder and neck stiffness, injuries, or pain. Product was in excellent condition and shipped fast."
5,Great Buy,"Purchased this car for a nursery, and I wish I would have gotten it for myself. Good product, excellent details, and great delivery condition. Would purchase again from the seller."
3,Not an accurate model by far,"In 1958, Chevy went from a single headlight setup (per side, duh!) with a 13-tooth grille to a dual headlight setup with a 9-tooth grille. The body side coves (the white part) had air louvers at the beginning of them by the front wheel and this model doesn't. The tires were the wide whitewall, not these. The Jewel Blue body & Cream coves this model tries to approximate in color were way better looking."
1,waste of money,"this book does not teach you anything beyond the very basics, and advertised web-based modelling support was something anyone can create in few minutes.I was fooled by positive ratings as so often is the problem in Amazon. This book only to enhance author's nice lifestyle in Honolulu."
4,Something to keep in mind....,"This is a decent set of shelfs and will hold a lot of DVDs, VHS tapes, etc., but you see in the instructions that it's recommended that you anchor it to the wall so it doesn't fall over. This isn't made clear in the ad or text on Amazon -- it recommends a screw into the wall and they supply a strap that you use. But if you can't put a screw into the wall or will have this somewhere where that's not a possibility, keep that in mind. You may be able to use it without anchoring it like that but it's worth knowing before you get one."
5,a great horse lover book,"i think this book was a great it shows God is always there even in hard times. it is about a girl who loves racing but when her father gets sick it's up to her and older brother to keep the farm running , but when some of the horses start getting sick her homework suffers. This book is best if you want excitement i hope you like it like i did"
2,The President would not say Donde,"This course is an odd mixture of formal and colloquial language and is too much Lisbon centred. It is full of colloquialisms like bica for black coffe and the like, you use in Lisbon but not everywhere in the country, let alone other Portuguese speaking countries. Pronunciation is not always the best standard. Donde is something careful speakers do not say, they say De onde (this means from where or where from in a question). At the other end of the scale you have very careful speech, like that of the President of Portugal, too advanced for a beginners course. This is neither a good beginners course nor a suitable advanced one. I would not use it with my students (I teach evening classes)."
3,INTERESTING FOR DINOSAUR FANS,THIS GAME HAS AN INTEREST LEVEL AROUND 8-14 YEARS. WELL DONE ILLUSTRATIONS WITH MINI-GAMES.
2,Discreet??,"Well. The insert is large, big enough for two AAA batteries and some to spare. It's also loud. As in, I could be standing accross the room and easily hear it. Also? The pocket placement on the panty is.. well whose anatomy is directed like that? Overall very disappointed. I suppose used traditionally the cordless aspect will come in handy, but for it's intended purpose this purchase was a waste. Even the loud hustle and bustle of Vegas can't drown out the sound, you can't possibly sit because of the size, but you wouldn't want to anyway because the location of the vibe is such that the whole panty is pointless anyway. Needless to say, 5 minutes into our ""fun sexy"" vacation this useless appliance was tossed back into the suitcase."
1,Not A Good Product!,"I bought this product at a love stuff store for my anniversary thinking it would be a great way to spice up the evening. I paid $90 for it. It is the worst thing I have ever bought! First of all, the ""one size fits most"" is only accurate if you are a small person. Second, the placement of the vibrator is very inaccurate, think further back from where you would want it. The vibrator is very big and uncomfortable and not shaped very well for where it should be placed. The remote only has an on and off switch, no multiple speeds. Bottom line is I do not recommend this product."
2,"Sexy and I know it, but these panties don't show it.","I was thrilled when this package arrived on my door step. Then shortly disappointed when my boyfriend and I tried it out for playtime and it wasn't pleasurable. We just ended up laughing at the loud sound of the vibrations coming from the panties I was wearing. Pretty panties, but not pleasing. Just for laughs. Not worth the $40."
2,disappointing...,"It says they are stretch lace and one size fits all. Whoever wears these must be pretty small, they are not very forgiving in size. And I had read that the pocket for the vibrator was not in the right spot to be truley effective. I would agree, it's not even close to being where it should. I may just sew a pocket ""in the right place"" onto a pair of panties I have to see if that will work. All in all a little disappointed with these."
1,It bombed,"This product was a one size fits all. I wear a size 2 and the thongs were too tight for me so I put the unit in my thongs. It is just a vibration that really is not that stimulating. If it had settings for intensity, it might be better."
1,not what it say,"every size doesnt fit all, and the panites that it come with it. is to small for the bullet to fit into"
3,"Not As Seen In The Movie ""The Ugly Truth""","I haven't used this product yet, but just by looking at it seems to be a little on the Bulky side. I think it would be alot better if the vibrater would be thiner and lighter."
1,Useful but not for the intended purpose,"I bought this product because I wanted to play with my girlfriend in public. I want to turn this on when we're riding the bus, the taxi, when watching a movie, at park, anywhere. If that's what you want then don't bother ordering this. You'll be disappointed by how loud it really is when turned on. ""Discreet"" my ass.Better buy something else because you'll only burn money with this one. Better buy the Hitachi massage wand. It's the same price and with the same purpose but better performance."
3,Noisy,"This is rather loud. When my husband and I were testing it out, he had turned it on with someone else in the room and they turned to find out what the noise was. If it is used in a noisy place, it would be just fine."
4,Remote vibrating thong review,"Thong size reference says one size fits most. They seem to be best fit for a size six to maybe a 10. However, the vibrating module does fit quite nicely into the lining of most other undergarments.The remote itself is simple. A switch to turn it on and off. The module does take a second or two to stop vibrating. It slows down to a stop rather than immediately stopping.All in all, a fun and interesting toy to take with you and have a bit of fun. It is a little loud, so have at it if you are in a noisy bar or restaurant. Not recommended for dinner with the parents on a quiet evening at home."
1,Super Small,I read that these run small so I purchased an XL. I normaly wear a Med. but even the XL was tight. The lace is cheep and itchy. The vibrating mechanism doesn't stay in the pocket built into the underwear. If you are very small and don't mind itchy you may like this.
1,As discreet as a jackhammer!,This is by far my biggest purchase regret on amazon. This is a horrible product. The vibration is so LOUD you would NEVER be able to take it in public. The vibration isn't even all that great. You would be better off with an electric toothbrush. Not to mention the thong it comes with would only fit you if you are a size zero. I would never recommended this product to a friend! I hate it. I wish I could ask for my money back.
1,Frustrating!!!,"3 days ago I rented this game from Blockbuster.Then the two days I played it,I did not like it at all.The plot is basicly kinda the same plot as Looney tunes acme arsenal.The evil guy from Jimmy Neutron is trying to kill the nicktoons by building toybots.And the nicktoons are trying to stop him.The gears that apear in some of the levels kill you if you touch them.And for health,you won't know when you are going to die beacause you have no lifebar in this entire game.So for this game,I have 2 things to tell you.Do not buy this game and do not rent this game.Just use your money to buy or rent something else.Thanks for reading."
3,Fun for Kids,"I bought it for my nephew, he seems to have a great time with it. Mostly because he can identify all of his favorite characters from cartoons. It's fun for all the kids and the content is appropriate for all ages."
4,"a little challenging for my 6 year old ,however, he still really enjoys playing.","Got this for my six year old son. He saw it advertised in a flyer that was tucked in to another Sponge Bob toy. I saw that it had an ""E"" rating so I bought it. The game is a little challenging for him and ,unfortunately, he gets pretty frustrated on the higher levels. My brother, who is an avid gamer and very experienced, said that "" it was indeed a little tricky in spots especially for a 6 yr. old"". My son loves all of characters options and the great sounds each one can make. If you get this for your younger ones, be prepared to step in at the beginning to help out...alot."
5,SWEET! GETTIN' IT!,"I played this game at my cousin's house. I've already gotten 10% completion, in 10 minutes. This has great graphics. It has all that, then some."
4,Very light...,"with grassy undertones, this is perfect for summer and actually light enough to mix with another summer fragrance with flowery notes (which I do)."
1,Backward approach,"This book would be helpful if a real entrepreneur, like one of the interview subjects, wrote it. Instead, the reader gets a bunch of interviews taped together with non-intuitive commentary from a hack who wants desperately to be one of the people he is interviewing."
