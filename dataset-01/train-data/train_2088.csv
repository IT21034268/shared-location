4,Good basic book,"This is a great book for those of us who do not have the time or the energy to become experts on the subject, but merely want to make some dramatic and positive improvements to our surroundings. The suggestions given are very doable and I'm incorporating them right now. A friend of mine also read this book, has applied it to her own home, with positive results. Great book."
5,review of Feng shui book,"Great book - has vital information and gets right to the point! A must, I feel if you are getting into Feng Shui! Thanks, Debbie"
5,feng shui tips for a better life,Great book full of excellant information. I would buy from this shipper AGAIN:)
2,Arrived broken,"Would of given this 5 stars but the cds arrived with a broken case and pieces of plastic fell all over the place when I opened it. Of course I can easily put the CDs into some spare sleeves I have laying around, but it was an anniversary gift to my wife and definitely detracted from it. The music is great though."
3,Good if you're older.,"I'm grew up in the sixties and seventies. So, this music is a little before my time. If I were older, I would love the set. There are a few gems here. I'm happy to get them. For the most part though, the majority isn't what I'm interested in. I admit though that my review isn't fair. This is not a product targeted to my age group."
4,Helpful,This is a very helpful book to get a understanding of how to file. It has examples of the paperwork BUT you can't zoom in to get a good look at it. I had to plug my puter into my TV to get a large enough image. Other than that this book can help you save money.
5,Second Only to an Experienced Bankruptcy Lawyer,"I am an experienced Arizona bankruptcy lawyer. This means I pretty much file consumer bankruptcy petitions day in and day out. As I tell all my clients, filing for bankruptcy protection without a lawyer is not for everyone - it requires a lot of learning (and probably a little bit of gambling). However, for those not willing to hire an attorney, I believe this Nolo book is a GREAT resource. A bankruptcy client of mine first introduced me to this book, and all that it offers. It does a pretty good job of walking a debtor through their bankruptcy petition. I should note that anyone with complicated cases should think twice about filing for bankruptcy without an attorney."
1,Cant print forms or worksheets,"Great book! Do not buy eBook edition as you will be unable to print all the wonderfully helpful worksheets and forms. If I had known this, I would have bought the hardbound book."
3,How to File Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,Book purchased from Amazon. This book has all the information you need. Most of the info is easy to understand for a textbook. It will be helpful to anyone contemplating bankruptcy.
4,"Great Information, But Get A Lawyer","This is a tough one to review, because there's so much that goes into filing for bankruptcy. But after reviewing the book cover to cover with a friend going through the process, here's my opinion: it's absolutely excellent for learning the basics of how bankruptcy works, allowing you to be extremely well informed when meeting with a lawyer.But I'd still recommend using a lawyer unless your bankruptcy is extremely straightforward. Laws differ state to state, for one thing, and learning how to protect what you are allowed to protect, certainly in the case of one member of a marriage going through the process, may well be too complex without legal help.Can you learn how to file and get through it using the book? Yes. But if you want to hedge your bets, try a professional. Unless, of course, your assets don't exceed the cost of a lawyer, in which case you might as well roll the dice."
3,how to file,"It was alright, I was expecting something all little more current. My fault for not checking it out better. The delivery was great, got it right away."
3,713,This book is good for a single individual or a married couple. No so good for a spouse that is filing alone in a community property state. Some of the questions need a more detailed explanation of why it is asked.
4,good manual,"This book is a good (large) manual that provides step by step instruction on how to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The book, however, does not aid in filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. There is a separate book for that. Overall, book is easy to read, detailed, covers the legalities, and would be very helpful for someone who was considering filing."
4,Lots of information!,"Glad I purchased this book. It answers all my questions, tells me where to go to get the information I need. It is extremely detailed but easy to understand. I really like it- except for the fact that Im even contemplating bankruptcy it is an extremely helpful guide!"
4,A well organized informative resource!,"How to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy is a well written manual to assist those of us who are needing this type of financial advise. The book is well organized, providing information on who should file for bankruptcy and the steps to do so. It also provides handy information broken down by state: such as what is exempt from a bankruptcy. While I don't believe this book can substitute for an attorney, I think it will answer most questions that will arise in the process of deciding to and organizing a bankruptcy."
2,Not As Expected,"When I bought this product, I was looking for the oil from the actual sagebrush plant. As this is not what I got, I was disappointed but my own fault for expecting the name of the product to BE what I wanted. It does smell ok, but not at all like the real stuff."
4,Great reading structure for kids,"Like I said, great structure for kids. I especially was having a tough time trying to get my 7 year old to read nightly a bible story. The way this breaks down a story for each day is great, and really it's just to help give her an overview of the bible. My prayer is that as she grows this will have been a great first step for her!"
5,Children's Bible,This Bible is wonderful for those children just starting to read or for those whose parents read to them. Our church gives it to the second graders for their first communion gift.
2,Children's Everyday Bible,I purchased two of these. The book itself is marvelous. Well written for an early to middle elementary reader and a great picture bible for reading to a younger child. My difficulty was that one of the copies had a torn spine inside the front cover. I had been trying to get a copy of this since Christmas since I had ordered it from another source for my granddaughter and never received it. I ordered two this time so I could have one on hand for another grandchild at a later time. The tear was a disappointment. I did not return it because of the hastle.
3,Childrens Bible,This childrens Bible has gorgeous pictures. The stories are very simplistic and don't finish on one page. They might cover several pages. I had expected something a little more indepth.
3,"Good, basic, not too deep",This book is good but just covers the basics. It doesn't go too deep into anything. I would recommend this for ages 4 and under to establish the basics of the Bible. But older than 5 can handle much more information.
3,Too simplistic,"In my opinion, the stories are too simplistic, watered down, and more like accounts than a real story. They didn't hold my interest or have much purpose, and the same was true for my 5 year old son. Not what I was hoping for. I think it's hard to take stories from the Bible out of context and simplify them to this level."
5,"A page-turner. Jeston Nash says:"" Ya just had to be there"".","Ralph Cotton's Jeston Nash is the kind of man a lady dreams of finding by her side on a dark sultry night... And the kind of Outlaw a man prays to a merciful God NOT to meet up with in the silence of the same darkness... The kind of man who'd sell you a tainted horse (completely against his will, you understand), protesting all the way to the bank. ...the kind of man who played wet-nurse to a young country; growing by leaps and bounds in its push to the Pacific Ocean. The kind of man who figured prominently in the real history of America. As Nash's friend, Quiet Jack often says: ""Yuh just had to be there."" Thanks to Cotton's words, you are"
5,Excellent newborn pack.,"Another nice product from KMR, this package deal includes a can of milk replacer mix, a can of weaning mix, some little tubes of probiotics to help with digestion (very helpful if you are dealing with a cat or kitten that has been sick or on antibiotics) and some nursing bottles. Super useful."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be,"This is probably the worst book of its kind that I've encountered. The book promises to explain why/how you should use the different features. I found myself mindlessly following the steps without having the vaguest idea why I'm doing it. Simply select this tool, choose that setting and click OK - with a few exceptions there are no explanations as to the differences between different tool settings. Apart from the abysmal typing errors/omissions on p.80 I'd say that the lessons on interactivity are probably the worst sections of the book. Rather go for the How to do Everything series books."
5,You won't want to put it down,"This book is long, but it MOVES!! It's a true story, written by a woman taken advantage of by her very selfish rich boss. Since the author needs her bosses sponsorship to stay in the country, she puts up with a lot of overwork and underpay.I promise you, you won't want to put this book down!"
4,Works great with my Verizon VX6700,The charger works great and charges my Verizon VX6700 PDA phone. It also works on my Motorola H800 BT headset.
5,hard to find 45's on cd's sweet soul sounds (various artists),"this cd is everyone's dream some music on here you may forgotten who song the record or fogotten the record period. why?because, you haven't them in so long i wish i could find some more there has to be others out here."
4,sweet memories of soul,"the production on this cd is excellent,a golden hour of some funky soul.a lot of good stuff here,arthur conley remined us of how fast i used to dance to funky street,doris troy with a soul classic track,archie bell with a very rare sound albeit,similar to hear i go again.chris bartley was one of the 1st soul records i bought,and somehow i lost it,nice to find it on this cd,sweetest thing this side of heaven,a collectors dream.there are only 2/3 tracks new to me;little sister,johhny adams.but good value for money and a welcome trip for me down memory lane.good stuff.is there gonna be a volume 2 ?."
3,A mediocre collection,In my opinion very few of theses songs by these artists ever became popular because they simply did not have any quality. There are so many cd producers suppossedly performing miracles these days because they are offering rarely heard material by various artists and 70% of it is pure junk. This cd I would say falls into the area between questionable and junk.
5,eric jerome dickey improves,"I've read ejd previous book and I wasn't very impressed with some most recent one so I had serious reservation about getting Thieves' Paradise and also because a lot of people I spoke to didn't think the book was that great. I got it anyway and I was hooked from the first page til the very last. It's a page turner to say the least. Ejd has really improved since his last books about love affairs & characters you could care less about. I loved the fact that this story takes place in a whole another world a world that weekly paycheck dependent,9 to 5-ers like average people don't live in. Ejd makes you cheer for these people and understand you got to do what you got to do. I'm looking forward to reading more from Mr.Dickey"
4,Excellent As Usual,"I am a huge fan of his work and this was no less. I was very intrigued as to what was going to happen to the main character, kept me coming back for more. Mr. Dickey never loses your attention. An excellent read you won't be disappointed."
2,Good book...terrible reader!!!,"I enjoyed Thieves' Paradise. It was a nice change of pace from the author's usual theme. However, I must complain about the reader. Bill Andrew Quinn's voice was all wrong for this book. His voice was annoying and took something away from an otherwise enjoyable book. Thieves' Paradise was worthy of three stars, but because of Mr. Quinn's terrible reading, I gave it two stars."
3,Paradise Can Be Hell,"Not bad. Not bad at all. I've been disappointed with Mr. Dickey's last two works, but this one may right the ship or help right itself. No pun intended. :)The characters were very well developed. They will be as memorable for me as Red, Brown, and Black in Sister, Sister. A refreshingly complex storyline, but falls off a bit in the attempt to make the character Scamz seem larger than life. Mr. Dickey has written from a woman's point of view before and did it incredibly well. I think this time it suffers because the main character was so colorful, and alive everyone else sort of paled next to him.Nonetheless, a good read, but I know better can come from this author. I'll be waiting."
4,Different EJD Book,"A few people are dogging EJD out about this book, it wasn't all that bad, it was just different from the rest of his books. The others ones tend to make you laugh, this one was a little more serious. I kinda like EJD change, it's alright to be versatile. The other books he had people had good jobs and hardly anything to worry about but sexual issues. This one people cant pay there bills, don't know where their next meal is coming from. And sometimes it forces you to make bad decisions, but you really a good person with morals. If you want a book to dog out, how about For the Love of Money, by Omar Tyree, now that's what you call bad."
2,Slow moving- Not Dickey's best,I enjoyed Milk in My coffee and was looking forward to reading more from Dickey. But this book really bombed out. It starts slow and spends too much time on sex scenes. Enough already. It also tries to make big secrets out of things that aren't such a big deal like what happened to Pam's kid. Don't expect a Dickey classic out of this one.
3,Alright,"I was really excited to read this book, because I have enjoyed everything by Mr. Dickey. This book threw me for a loop. It was just alright ok it was a page turner because I wanted to see what would happen next. Mr. Dickey you could have done better than this, but I will still support you on whatever you write because you're my homeboy."
5,Flipt the Script,"EJD has proven that he is quite capable of writing more than one type of novel. This one was totally different from the las few, but equally as good. Mr. dicket succesfully captured life in the streets with his true to life characters. This man definitely has talent and is a foece to be reckoned with. Keep 'em coming,Eric."
3,Flipping the script,"I couldn't wait for this book to be released. However, I was totally surprised because this book is VERY different then what I'm used to reading from Eric. Thieves Paradise started off sllllow but did pick up pace near the middle. It's still a good read!I've read ""ALL"" of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and look forward to the next.Keep up the good work Eric!"
4,He does it again,Thieves' Paradise goes along with every day life and you can relate to it. With all the identity theft and other illegal activities you can see a brother or sister who has lost there jobs or working a job that barely pays the bills turning to a life of crime.
4,Thieve's Paradise,Really enjoyed this book - full of little surprises. I gave to my 31 year old nephew to read and he's almost finished - likes it too. We're both interested in more books from Eric Jerome Dickey.
2,What's really going on...........EJD????,"Let me say that I Love me some EJD.......but I can't figure out what happened with this book. I just could not get into it no matter how hard I tried, I kept saying this is EJD so I know it is going to get better.....but it never did so I have to actually give it 2 1/2 stars because something was definitely missing. I still love your writing style EJD.Much LoveMs.P"
2,Not adding to book collection,"EDJ is an amazing modern author who had me hooked from the first book I read of his. I was in sort of a let down reading TP. My disappointment mainly came from the female characters in the book. The only positive female book was Big Slim's slain girlfriend. Sabrina, Pam, Sierra, and all the other females characters were immature. They relied on a man way too much. EJD is still an awesome author, but this book was not that great. Not everyone can hit a homerun everytime."
2,Not his best,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was not something that I was use to from Mr. Dickey. I read it because I am a true fan, however it could have been better."
2,He actually let me down!!!,I love EJD but this one left me hanging. Probably because i'm already use to his kind of writting...Although he wrote the story very well. I just didn't like it period...
4,Made a mistake Mr. Dickey,"While I was reading ""Thieves' Paradise,"" I noticed that Mr. Dickey made a mistake. Robin, Jackson's fiancee, had a silver Passat when he first described her car and her licensed plate that read EYE FLY 4 U then it went to Pam's green Nissan which was described as Robin's green Nissan with the licensed plate that read EYE FLY 4 U. Then at the end Robin had her silver Passat again. People has to look out for small mistakes like the one I pulled out but i still have nothing but love for Mr. Dickey. He is one of my favorite authors."
4,Thieves' Paradise,"THIEVES' PARADISE WAS DEFINTELY BETTER THAN THE ONE BEFORE IT, SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER THE TITLE. THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK OVERALL BUT AT TIMES HAD A TENDENCY TO BE A LITTLE DRAWN OUT. MAKE YOUR POINT AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!THIS BOOK WAS OKAY."
5,Fast paced and exciting,"In Thieves Paradise we meet Dante Brown, a twenty five year old who is down but not out and determined to make it. Old school friend Jackson is between jobs and dealing with stressful issues from his babies mother and lady friend Robin. Scamz is a con man and master mind of the game. Pam is the waitress want to be actress that Dante is infatuated with. Hold on tight because Thieves Paradise offers a bumps ride over a three day period.EJD has mixed in suspense, a taste of erotica, scams, and a dash of action to give us a different genre this time around. Another good one to add to my collection. Love and support to you Eric. Looking forward to your next release."
5,Great Book,"After reading this book, I can truly say that there is an art to being a criminal. A life of crime is not all that it is cracked up to be. Mr. Dickey took me into a life of a thief and showed me that the life they live is not a life that I would consider glamorous. I don't care how easy the money is. You can't even trust the one you are in love with.Yes, the money seems to come easy with the scams that are run, but the life is not easy by no means.I commend Mr. Dickey with all the research and efforts that he put forth to create such a fantastic novel. This book is a great page-turner. I kept wanting more. In this book you will find humor, love, sex, friendship, and respect.What did ""Siskel and Ebert"" use to say, I give it a thumbs up..."
3,A con game left steamless,"Scamz and Dante are like father and son who con people out of their money. Their friend Jackson, because of baby mama drama can't seem to get it together. I should have borrowed this book from the library. Three stars."
2,Mr. Dickey was the Thief,"My Washington D.C book club agreed that this was Dickey at his absolute worse. We were very disappointed with this book. In fact, after we struggled through the book we decided to cancel our book club meeting. We later decided to have a book bashing meeting instead. In a nutshell, Mr. Dickey used his loyal readers as guinea pigs for his personal experiment into mystery writing. His characters were not well developed and his story lines were incomplete. This was more of a comedy than a mystery. Mr. Dickey was the thief."
3,"A page turner, yet missing something","I found this to be a good book, like most of Eric's work. However, the characters were somewhat under developed. Pam, for instance, is sitll a question mark as far as I'm concerned. This book could have used a little less setting description and more character dialog."
2,It's alright I guess,"I really couldn't get into the book. I put it down after the third chapter. Eric Jerome Dickey, disappointed me this time. I have all of his other books, and they were really good and funny. This one, I don't know, I just wasn't into it at all. His next book, I'm going to wait till it comes out on paperback before I run out and get the hardcover. ..."
2,Weak,"The Scamz character is the only reason I would recommend anyone read this book. All the characters in this book have a watered down feel to them. I think there is just to many people and not enough energy to go around. He should concentrate more on couples, more specifically the father,son relationship of Scamz and Dante. Eric really needs to search his soul and not the media for success. This book could have had the potential to be a blockbuster like his earlier novels. Instead it got played out like public television."
5,Off the Chain!!!!!,"Yes, EJD does it again. I thought it just couldn't get any better after ""Between Lovers"", but I'm hear to tell you that it can and believe it or not TP is even better. EJD continues to be able to rope you into the characters and there feelings even when you say ""There is no way anyone could possible be in this situation"" TP pulls you in and wraps you up, with twist and turns, even from people you would be the least likly to suspect. But isn't that the way life is.....Definitly 1 of the best reads of the season....and I Love Cool Hand Dante'"
3,Not one of his better books,"I have enjoyed almost all of Dickey's books, but this didn't hold my attention."
4,Thieves Paradise,"I thought the book was a good read. It shows how multi-talented EJD really is. He can pretty much right about anything. As for the reader from Jan. 18, 2003, relax, it's fiction. He explains Dante's character and how he has an old soul and the people he dealt with were much older than he was. So, some of the lingo used would be conducive for his backdrop.People pray for rain but complain when there's a flood.Anyway, I would recommend this book however, I would recommend reading his other books first."
2,Too Slow,"I am a huge fan of EJD, but this book just didn't capture my attention. I tried to read this several times and every time I end up putting the book back down. This is the first time I've ever been dissapointed in a book by EJD. It just starts a little too slow for me."
2,He's definitely written better,"I've read all of EJD's books and I find this one to be my least favorite. It took me longer than usual to get into it. I got to a point where I asked myself did I even want to finish it! But as I read I found myself liking it more and more. It was different than his other books and I tried to be open minded, but I don't like this kind of writing from him. Maybe if he'd gone into more detail with the characters? Whatever. I will still buy his books and read them. I'm a loyal fan."
4,Different but interesting....,"I see that Eric was trying to do something different with this book. A little further left than his usual sex,seduction and deception novel... Although this book encompassed these same elements, it was done with more of a mysterious twist. I love my frat for his powerfully written sex scenes, but the ones in this book had a softer edge... It was less about intimate relationships and more about life's relationships and challenges. It took me a minute to get adjusted to this new style, but I enjoyed the writing just the same... EJD fans will not be upset with his writing style..."
1,His WORST Work!,I have been reading this book for over a month and have yet to get the just of it. He throws in way too many characters at one time and then the 'relationship' or lack there of between Dante and the older woman is taking WAYYYY too long to get moving.I have read ALL of E. J. Dickey's other books and none of them were as slow and poorly written as this one. I have yet to find a book that I couldn't complete because it was that awful - UNTIL THIS ONE........I would not recommend that you buy it - BORROW IT FROM ME!
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the book and compared to his last two novels this is realy good but it still has it's flaws for starters I couldn't care less and couldn't understand why Dante was so attracted to Pam the actress, she had absolutely nothing going for her as Dante himself said ""She can't pay her rent but she wants 6,000 for plastic surgery on her stomach as if that would finally get her an Osacr"" I wished EJD spent more time in developing the relationship with Scamz and Dante, I thoroughly enjoyed these two, then wasting 2-3 chapters in a row on Dante and Pam having sex. I also wanted to learn more about Arizona, I really liked her, in the few pages she was in the book I was more intrigued with her character than Pam. but knowing EJD, he will write another novel and Arizona will be a main player :)All in all I ejoyed the book, a true guilty pleasure for the summer."
1,lost,"Maybe I should re-read this, but the whole collection on this group lost me. I think this was way out of his element. I applaud Dickey for switching it up but this just didn't do it for me."
3,One soul for one's life,"After reading a few of Eric Dickey's novels, you can tell that this was one of his earliest books. It was a good read, but its not really a book i would go back to as much as his others. It was interesting to see how the main character had to choose between saving his soul or saving his friend's life after a moment of stupidity on his part. But like i said, its not really one i would go and reach for all the time when i need a good book."
4,Another Dickey HIT!,"In reading this book I could tell that it was one of his earlier works, but not in a bad way. This book delivers just like all the others! Visit his web-site... [...]"
3,Where is the real EJD?,"I know that an author likes the mix things up and give his/her readers something different, but this was a not a good book. EJD lost me on this book about a so-called big time scam artist and how he was so determained to pull a twenty-five year old into his world of trouble.EJD had dissappointed with his last book (Between lovers) and he has did it once again."
3,"Oh, What A Change.","This is one of my favorite authors, but he threw mea curve with his writing style on this one.It's a good book, but I found the others much easierto read. It was a struggle for me to finish it, unlikehis previous books.However, I wouldn't hesitate to buy any books by thisauthor because three stars for him is just a comparisonof his previous work."
2,Disappointed,I am a ED fan. I have read all of his books. Friends and Lovers is my favorite. This one was a bit disappointing. It was OK but from ED I expected more.
5,Carol *Brenda C&B Books Distribution,"Eric Jerome Dickey never fails us we sell African American books and believe me Eric's books are always a sell-out.However, I must confess we just couldn't stock enough copies of this new book. Thieves' Paradise hit top sellers status fromMay - August, dropped off and picked up again in the beginning of November. This was a different twist in writing for Eric and his readers enjoyed the change of writing style and they keep ordering this book. Eric, keep witing so we can keep selling your books. This book is one of our largest Christmas orders.Good Book is all we can say! Thank you Eric for being such a wonderful caring down home person. Eric gives back and that makes him very special in our book. Carol & Brenda The Book Ladies of Queens"
3,A Good Turning Seventeen Book,"I was hoping for a better Maya book. THe first book about her was way more interesting. This one just showed how she deals with Amandas bulimia, and how she tries to be good at track again. It didn't really show her relationship with her friends and boyfriend, which is mainly what these books are about. But it was a pretty good book, and I'm happy that I ordered it!"
1,Aweful,"Could not get thru the first chapter of this book. Usually I at least try to get 3 or 4 chapters in but with this one, no way. Not easy to read."
4,Great for dogs!,"I ordered these for my 45 lb. dog. They were a tight fit so I don't believe the weight limits on the package are correct. I would order an XL, instead. Otherwise, they're pretty easy to use (even with a wiggly dog) and don't come off terribly easily."
3,Active Dog Workaround,"I purchased these diapers for a 40-lb female dog who experiences excessive flow during heat. As she is still a young dog, she remains quite active and I'm sorry to report that the tabs that are supposed to hold these diapers around the dog's waist can't handle her activity. These would probably be perfect as is for older, less active dogs, but I have had to resort to good old duct tape in order to keep her in her diapers. I basically cut a length long enough to go around her waist, and after I've put on the diaper and attached the tabs, I use the duct tape like a belt to reinforce the tabs. It works great and she seems completely comfortable.One more problem solved by duct tape.Other than the fit issue, these diapers are perfect for a dog in heat."
2,was broke when arrivied,looked real nice till i noticed the big crack running for one of the legs. must have been droped pretty hard during shipment.
5,"Tommy Lee Jones - Great now, great then","As per usual the movie did not do the book justice, but it was still one of the best movies. Rosanna Arquette is fabulous too. Seeing them so young makes you forget who they are and concentrate more on the storyline. I only wish this was DVD. I remember watching this when I was 15. They way he was trying to cope with release from prison was what seemed to set the story for me. I think anyone will find this a great movie. It isn't gory like Helter-Skelter, but just as fascinating."
1,What happened to the rest of the movie?,If I knew that half of the movie was edited out I wouldn't have bought it.
1,the executioner's song,"this dvd has been edited. if there were less, if would have given it. no stars"
4,Shjould be issued as a DVD,"It amazes me that some of the more well done TV mini-series have not made it to DVD. This film made a lasting impression on me when it initially aired; and I would very much like to see it appear on DVD...I'd buy it in a minute(New York or otherwise!). The execution scene by firing squad was hard to forget.For those of us who admire Tommy Lee Jones' work, it seems to be a ""missing link"" in what is currently available on DVD.Maybe there is hope, however, as Final Countdown has now arrived on DVD; as well as the monumental work, Shogun."
1,Spit In The Audience's Face,"I can't even construct a bad explanation as to why they'd do this. A lot of people were looking forward to this DVD release. The uncut, original version is (was), no, is perhaps the greatest miniseries/made-for-TV-movie ever made. No, naturally, Lawrence Schiller's (or whoever's responsible) first instinct was to butcher it."
1,The Executioner's Song - DVD Director's Cut,"I saw the original on TV, have rented the VHS numerous times and have read the book numerous times. The Director's Cut is a hatchet job on the film. The relationship between Gary and Nicole is crucial to the story, yet here we see very little of it. It has been cut so severely that one gets the impression that it was not much of a relationship at all. If Lawrence Shiller cut this film, then shame on him! I, like many, have been waiting for this to come on DVD. They could have put the original four hours on DVD, yet have reduced this to a 2 1/2 hour abomination. I want my $18.00 plus shipping back! I have ordered the original VHS because I was so disappointed in this. DO NOT BUY IT!The Executioner's Song (Director's Cut)"
4,Bring this movie back!,"Since Norman Mailer's Pulitzer Prize winning book has been reissued, it's about time to bring the movie back. I saw the movie long before I read the book, and the casting, now that I've finished the book, is amazingly right on. Tommy Lee Jones and Roseanne Arquette are wonderful!"
3,Not what you think!,"I recently purchased this movie and was very disappointed with it. There were scenes gone from this edition and it was supposed to be a ""director's cut"" sorry but WHATEVER. If you get a chance to see the tv edition of this movie, you will know what i mean. Stick with the tv edition, it's a lot better."
3,The Executioner's Song,Yes it was REALLY cut up.Like an old rerun of a movie on TV.Does anyone know how to find the movieversion that has the ending BAR scenes AFTER the Execution? I know it was made because I saw it being filmed in Utah.I read somewhere it could have been the European version.
2,"""Directors Cut""","When I see a movie advertised as ""The Directors Cut"" I expect to get the full lenght UNCUT AND UNEDITED version. After waitng for years for this movie to be on DVD, I was extremely disappointed to see that this ""Directors Cut"" had editied and cut scenes in it. In my opion this IS NOT a Directors Cut.The Executioner's Song (Director's Cut)"
4,"Jones, Arquette Play Interesting-But-Sick 'Characters'","For a long ""television film,"" I thought this story moved along well, even with the main characters being so sleazy the story gets a little unappealing at times. Of course, when has Rosanna Arquette ever played anything else in her younger days? Also, when did she not show off her big breasts? (not that I'm complaining).As for Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the main character ""Gary Gilmore,"" I've always found him interesting, too. In this, Jones plays the famous real-life killer while Arquette is ""Nicole Baker,"" his teenage girlfriend. Jones does a nice job showing how mentally messed up Gilmore was back then.I was surprised at the language in here for a television movie, but then again, I saw the ""European version"" of this movie on a VHS. The American version, I assume, cut out some that language and perhaps some of Arquette's ""skin."""
3,Difficult to Believe,This script manipulatively sanitizes the two main characters when it turns out they had both been despicable outlaws from day one. A later prison incident reveals that drugs had been the major factor in their romance. Perhaps the extended version showed them to be the outlaws they really were. Good acting; lousy script.
3,EXECUTIONER'S SONG,A TV MOVIE FROM A FEW YEARS AGO WHICH BEARS ANOTHER LOOK-SEE..PRETTY GOOD BUT RATHER DEPRESSING..IN FILM NORRE'WAY. WORTH YOUR TIME TO WATCH..GOOD QUALITY.
1,I Want My Two Hours Back,"I want my two hours back, the two hours of my life I wasted watching this abomination of a recut classic. How a director could savage and homogenize his greatest accomplishment is totally beyond me.Put simply, the original was white hot in it's display of the sexual magnetism between the two exceedingly pitiful main characters - hot enough to be the work Tommy Lee Jones and Roseanne Arquette's future performances would forever be judged against.But it isn't just the fleeting but heavenly sights of Ms. Arquette skirting in and out of the sheets that we're missing here. It's giant chunks of storytelling and character development.Dumbed down and made safe as milk, a daring film made dull as dishwater.Avoid at all costs. I mean it... if you see it at a yard sale for 49 cents, leave it on the pile with the broken 8 track player and the baby sneakers. Total rubbish."
1,Censorship makes this a totally different movie. Too bad,"The original move was uncensored but I hardly recognized this mess as the same movie I enjoyed so many years ago. I made the mistake of thinking ""Director's Cut"" meant it was the original film. Boy was I wrong!The only reason to purchase this chopped to pieces version is to use it as an example of our purtain, censorious moral beliefs in a society that rates violent movies as G or PG and lovemaking or nudity as R or X.What a perfect example of our upside-down beliefs.You are missing a great movie here, but not this gutted version!"
2,mis-representation,This is a good movie but labled as directors cut you would exspect more in the movie not less. movie companys are re-relising movies under director cut and unrated just for sales. i remember seeing this on the movie networks years ago and it was shocking and controversial. this edition is substansialy shorter than the vhs version. if you have never seen this movie i do recomend it but if you can get the vhs edition.also it would be nice too have reveiws that are specifically for the product in question and not for every edition they produce it in.
5,Tommy Lee Jones is superb in his portrayal of Gary Gilmore.,What a great movie! Tommy Lee does a superb performance portraying the convicted killer Gary Gilmore. Tommy Lee and Roseanne Arquette really make this movie execiting. I think this is one of the finest true life dramas ever produced. BRING BACK THIS MOVIE!! I would really like to purchase this movie. Why isn't it available? I'm sure I am not the only one who would like to purchase it. Please BRING IT BACK!
3,DON'T LIKE DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION,"I bought this movie out of nostalgia, for I worked at that prison, and had a minor role in the movie.I really wish I could get the ORIGINAL version of the movie, ""THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG"", for the director's cut is a huge disappointment."
5,My best beauty find to date,"I am a skin type ii to iii in the Clinique system. I put this on after I've cleansed and toned, but before I moisturise. It stops my T-zone shining up for hours on end (practically all day). It has also helped with my blackhead problem, preventing more forming, and sort of easing out the ones that are already there. This has been my best beauty find to date."
4,Wonderful,"This is the only thing I've ever used for oily skin (especially in the t-zone) that has actually worked! It's not heavy and dramatically reduces the appearance of pores. I gave it four stars because as amazing as it is, sometimes I have to re-apply during the day."
3,A Bridge Book for Experts Only,"I read and studied Standard Bidding for the 21st Century and liked it so much I bought Advance Bridge Bidding for the 21st Century. It was an interesting read, but I found it of little value. This book is based on the first book (Standard Bidding). For each topic in the first book Hardy moves it up a level or two. The techniques described here are so abstract and theoretical I would need a partner who studied it with me and practiced with me for a long time. There is no one on the internet sites who use these techniques. The conventions and gadgets are for the most part, not intuitive. They require a LOT of memory work. I have enough problems playing what everyone else plays. I can see Experts experimenting with this scientific stuff, but definitely, not the average ""advanced"" player. My advice to the average: stick with the first book."
1,WATCH OUT/BUYER BEWARE,When buying these from private sellers make sure you read the fine print and/or contact the seller to make sure you will be receiving ALL 5 volumes. I thought I was but I only got the fourth reader. I have no way of going back to read the offer to see if I missed something in the fine print but...lesson learned. I like the copy I got and will be keeping it but not sure if I would have paid for just one volume as there may have been a better deal out there for all 5.
1,Not All Five Volumes,"It says that it's a five volume set, but all I got was the Study Guide, none of the actual Eclectic Readers. Not cool."
3,Floor puzzle -- US map,Grandaughter was disappointed that the puzzle pieces were NOT in the shape of the states.
2,Unfortunately boring,"I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life. Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational. I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it. Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me."
1,Complete crap,"I have the other Thule car rack that grabs onto the bike frame. It seems easier to use and of higher quality. Comparing this to my other roof rack, this one is unnecessarily difficult to attach to the roof. It also seems to have many components of cheap plastic. I don't get a warm feeling that the ratchet arm will stay locked. Given another chance, I wouldn't get this.After using this for 2 years, I now consider it complete crap. The cheap plastic parts don't work. After only using it 3 times the cheap plastic switch the locks the ratchet arm refused to disengage. This left my bike stuck on top of the car overnight, and I ended up spending an hour getting the bike off. Due to poor quality Thule is dead to me. I will not be buying another of their products.I got a 2 bike Hollywood rack for 100 dollars. It works great and is fast to put bikes on and off."
2,Thule Sidearm Rooftop Upright Bike Carrier,Product was delivered to my door incomplete - missing the wheel straps. Hugely disappointed but it would have been more work to return than to keep and make do. The rack itself is excellent. It holds the bike securely without scratching the paint as advertised. I would caution against purchasing this product online to avoid missing components from the start.
2,Where did the story go?,"This author has taken what is a great series and totally gone somewhere else. Is this the same series I watch each Friday night? I don't think so. Characters are missing, Sam Carter, General Hammond, Teal'c, where are these people in all this. West is back, Kowalsky is suddenly alive. I didn't even finish this book completely, because what has become a very enjoyable series was mutilated by someone who doesn't apparently even watch it. I can forgive small errors, but this author just decided to change the story completely. I won't wait in anticipation for any other stories. I have read the flaps on the continuing novels, ie Retribution, Retalliation etc. and it appears that a new story is being written."
4,The next chapter in the StarGate saga,"This book is more realistic than the TV show (Stargate SG-1) mostly because of the ""take over"" of the UMC. Of course if the Stargate was real, this would probaly be what actualy happens on Abydos, inculding the conflict between the Earthmen and The natives. The Earthmen (urt-man) are gready and try to cheat the natives, at the same time colapsing their world in violence and destruction. Ra is dead, but his more deadly succesor, Hathor (the goddess of sex, drugs, and rock n roll), covered the worlds before Abydos with blood, and has plans to do the same. :)"
3,A decent Star Trek yarn...,"I am a die-hard Star Trek fan, but my favorite Star Trek episodes are those that are ""hard"" science fiction, rather than fantasy. This novel falls securely within the fantasy genre, but it is not bad at all for all that. Basically, here, the Federation is experiencing ripples in time (again) but this time this is causing suns to go nova, to horrible effect. Obviously, the Guardian of Forever is on the fritz, and therein lies the (rather improbable, but reasonably engaging) story.Crispin's prose is clear and keeps the storyline moving along smartly, at least most of the time, and this story is not bad at all. Most Star Trek fans will enjoy this novel, and it is perfect for an afternoon of beer and chips, as I myself discovered."
3,A simple introduction to religious diversity,"This is a very simple look at some of the biggest religions of the world - Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Sikhism. Each holy book gets four pages with large text and brightly colored photographs. The book includes two pages of ""Find Out More"" information written in smaller type, a glossary containing words bolded from the text of the book, Books to Read, and an index. The glossary could be more extensive, but it probably doesn't need to include each and every strange word since the text and the pictures do a good job of providing a context for unfamiliar words. The book opens by comparing the child's favorite book to the idea of sacred books. This approach will work best with younger children, perhaps in grades 2 to 3."
3,"Game is great, but offer not honored","I'm sure the game is great, and keeps child quiet in car, but newspaper and online offer the value pack included when you purchase bundle, which I did, and order page will not honor the promo code for it, so I feel we are being shorted a 9.99 offer that other customer's may or may not have received. I don't appreciate false advertising, and were it not so close to Christmas, and were the Advance system not is such high demand, we would not have ordered through ToysRUs because of the false advertising. Happy with the toy, unhappy with the company."
4,Is the color worth it?,"We bought this Gameboy Advance because Blue is my 6-year-old son's favorite color. He loves the game and plays it non-stop. I don't have a problem with the system, but I really don't like the Toys R Us logo at the top. It makes it look somewhat chintzy. Now I also realize that we can't get matching accessories other than pay $... for the entire bundle. With the standard colors, it was easier to buy just a few accessories. At this point, we are struggling with whether to exchange for the $... pack with the color-cordinated accessories or live with mismatched accessories."
2,Don't bother,"Unless Nintendo has improved their displays, don't bother with this combo. I ordered this for the kids around Christmas and we returned it. The display was weak and pathetic. You could hardly see and the racing game seemed pretty unresponsive. All the kids were frustrated and disappointed. They are are all Nintendo junkies but this unit and game and ended up left on the kitchen table unused. I returned it. I rated it a 2 because I guess it could have been worse, but not much worse."
4,Bundle deal,This is a really great buy but as advertised it should include the value pack..I didn't receive the value pack either..They shouldn't advertise unless they honor it!
3,It's only a CD!,At first when I ordered it I was under the impression that I was getting at least a collection of cd's and as it turns out it is just one cd! The cd content is not impressive and the graphics are poor by comparison. I am somewhat sceptical that this cd would be enough to pass the two exams for the A+.
1,Piece of crap!,"First, no instructions or hints as to how to use it, position it, whether it goes just around the balls, dick plus balls, or just around the shaft, but that's minor compared to the lousy construction: the little knob at the end of the center pull-release shaft WILL come off in your hand. There are more comfortable alternatives... a plain rubber tube like the nurse uses on your arm when you get a blood test!"
5,I just oved this album growing up.,I just loved this album growing up and have desperately looked for some of these tracks on CD. I've since become a huge fan of Lully and Rameau. Though Rameau is not on this album he has been my favorite composer now for about 20 years. I really wish they showed a track listing and samples for this album because there is a certain track I loved most and I don't know who the composer is or the track title.
5,Full of Goodies!,"I bought this book because it was by Anna Franklin, one of my favourite Pagan authors. It is full of information on how to celebrate the Eight Pagan Festivals- there are hundreds of recipes, all with seasonal ingredients, together with ideas for altars, incense recipes, plus lore, history and a chapter of rituals. Furthermore there is information on handfasting ceremonies and celebrations, and full moon (esbat) rites and food, preserving, wine and mead making, and preparing ritual food. I don't know how I mananged before I got this book- it has the information of ten other books, and with Anna Franklin you can be sure that the information is accurate."
1,"Sorry to say but, everything funny is on the cover!","This was a major disappointment - bought it as a gift for an airline employee friend; since the author is supposed to be a pilot for an airline, I really expected some very funny, insightful cartoons; however, except for the ""cover"" cartoon (which is cute but not hilarious and is about as good as this gets), the humor was extremely ""lame"". An example: Picture 2 Pilots in the cockpit, with the Captain calling out, ""Typhoid, Tetanus, Measles..."" and the First Officer with a ""thought balloon"" above his head, saying, ""Boy, he really likes calling the shots!"". Believe it or not, this is REALLY a prime example of the humor here. My advice would be to save your money for a future flight - that's where the real humor can come in!"
5,Unsurpassed Industry Humor,"Yes, this book is ourtrageously corny. If you're looking for cerebral laughs, then the New Yorker would be a better choice. But, both my eight year old son and I found this book a hoot. I laughed, my kid roared(it's clean too). Silly and inane, to be sure. I'm in the ""biz,"" but you only need to have stepped on an airplane to appreciate the gags. Well spent 10 bucks."
5,Love this pump !!!,I am a new mom using this breast pump for the first time. And this product is just awesome !!. It is easy to set and use. I got this after seeing the reviews here and it didn't disappoint me. It will be helpful for all mom's who have to step away from the baby for a short while and it is very affordable. Will definitely recommend this product.
5,Amazing!,"I had to turn in my hospital pump and started using a store-bought electric pump. I cried at how inefficient it was. I started reading reviews on manual pumps and ran into this one. When I used it I could not believe I was getting more milk in less time than the electric pump. I can pump 3oz in about 5 minutes. HOWEVER, I did find that it works much better without the comfort seal. My nipple hurt a bit, but I got used to it. It does have a lot of parts to wash and can take long to air dry."
5,My favorite BF accessory,"Determined to succeed at breastfeeding, I purchased both this pump and a Medela Pump in Style Advanced. I really prefer this pump because it's far more gentle and lets me be in control of the speed and pressure. It's super easy to clean (you can throw the parts in a Medela steam bag) and very portable. I plan to take it on an upcoming trip, not sure if I will even bother bringing the Medela pump since it's so bulky. If you're on the fence about it, I would suggest you buy it!"
5,This is great!,"Just wanted to add a quick review for this pump. I should note that I haven't tried an electric pump. However, I found this to be very comfortable and easy. I got quite a bit a milk with minimal effort. I'm sure how much you are able to pump varies from person to person, but I think this pump still did a great job. It was easy to put together and simple to figure out how to use it. I haven't noticed a squeaking sound. I also like how you can determine the suction simply by how far you depress the handle. I definitely recommend this to those who don't want the expense of an electric pump!"
1,LOST SUCTION,I bought this product from Wal-Mart. It lost suction after only 1 month. Waste of $. Should have just paid more for a pump that will last.
4,great product for the price,"I've never used any kind of breast pump before and decided to get the manual one before a double electric once, just to have on hand for emergencies. I was a little intimidated by all the pieces but the manual does a great job of simplifying how to put it together and once you've done it once it seems obvious. It's very easy to use and very comfortable. I've been using it to pump just a little before nursing (because of a little engorgement, which makes it harder for baby to latch on). It suits this purpose very well."
5,Smart and Great Breast Pump,"I have been using Avent manual pump for the past and thought it is the best pump ever until I came across this pump at Amazon. I bought it just to try it out and found that it's better than the previous one I used, for it's speed, quietness. Moreover, I think it was designed well as my milk don't get trap on the cushion part as well as on the part/stem where the milk flow thru the valve which happens for the Avent pump."
4,"easy to use, works well","It took me a few minutes to set it up the first time, but it's easy to use. I prefer using it at night rather than dealing with the pump in style advanced. It's an effective pump."
5,Great pump for the $$$!,"I really like this pump. I already had a Medela PIS (that I really like), but with a toddler running around getting into everything, this works great. I can easily put it away when not in use, and don't have to get out and hook up a bunch of cords and tubes to use it. It does have an occasional obnoxious squeak now and then, but it's still no where near as loud as an electric. I've been able to get 4-5 ounces in only 10 minutes or so. It does have very few parts (only 5 plus the bottle) to clean after use. Highly recommend!"
1,"After 100 days, it is defective","My wife has used it for 100 days without problem. Last night, it doesn't work anymore. Manu. doesn't offer warranty on this product. I have to go to local store to get another one in the mid-night. Poor experience."
5,A great pump!,"I've been using this pump exclusively for 3 months now and my only complaint is that the diaphragm lost it's airtight seal. However, Lansinoh is sending me a new one immediately at no charge.This pump is very comfortable. Which is helpful when you use it daily. Its got an ergonomic handle and its clear plastic makes it easy to see how much milk is being expressed. I also love that you pump directly into any standard size bottle. It's quiet and can travel easily. All in all this is a super pump. I highly recommend it."
1,Terrible Pump,"I bought this pump because of the high reviews, but this was disappointing. It was very uncomfortable and I could barely pump 2oz. It took 15 minutes of pumping for a little less than 2oz!! It was not worth it for me. My son is exclusively breastfed and at 10 weeks I have an established milk supply. Waste of money for me."
4,Great pump!!,"I've been using this pump for over 7 months now. I use it at home and when I am away from my baby for more than 4 hours.It is a little bit of hard labor(My hand does hurt if I continuously pump for 15 minutes straight), and little time consumingthan hospital graded pump, but it does get the job done. And, after a while you get use to the labor and time."
5,Terrific manaul pump,"I have exclusively breast feed 2 children and I am currently on my third. I rarely have the need to give expressed milk in a bottle, but I do on certain occasions. This manual pump is super easy to use and I have easily gotten 4oz in about 10 minutes of pumping (I do have a very good supply though). All in all a great manual pump at a great price and perfect for mom's that have the occasional desire to pump."
5,Perfect for Travel!,"This pump is perfect for travel!!!It took me a moment to get used to it, bcs I use an electric double pump at home, but I love this manual pump!Wonderful design. I can just relax (that's key!) hold the little purple handle down until the stream stops flowing. Easy to take apart, rinse and toss in a net ""lingerie"" laundry bag, or run through the dishwasher and put away.Lifesaver on the road."
4,Very nice!,I purchased this manual pump because I will be flying around for the holidays and did not want to haul my breast pump bag and have to worry about it as well as other carry on bags and a baby tow. I tried it out when it arrived and I really am impressed. I have tried other manual pumps and found many of them to be squeaky and about as comfortable as my regular pump. This manual pump is much quieter than most and has a nice rubber insert that makes pumping feel more comfortable. I am impressed and very satisfied.
1,don't waste your money here,"got it for my wife and she tried various techniques and found not efficient at all. For occasional l use, may be ok. But if you need to use it frequently, I suggest you may not happy with one. She used it for few days and thrown it away."
2,Comfortable but useless,"I suppose this would be a good idea if you were an A or B cup but I have to wonder how many lactating women can actually use the very teeny breast shield on this pump, which is even smaller than the smallest Medela shield and cannot be removed and replaced with a larger one like the Medela pump can. Utterly ineffective and not even returnable, so think twice if you are somewhat larger than an adolescent up top."
3,Meh,"I used this pump with my middle child. I only needed it for occasional use, to have bottles if I would be away from him or in a place where it would not be convenient to nurse.It is fairly easy to take apart for cleaning, however it also leaks and the suction was not fantastic."
4,Pretty handy little pump.,"I like this little hand pump. It's small enough to throw in a bag if you need to occasionally pump on-the-go and the flange fits my large nipples easily. Also, the silicone flange guard really helps keep the pump from irritating me and being uncomfortable. Of course you can't expect the same quantity of milk or speed of pumping that you would get out of something like a double-electric, but for an occasional pumper I think it works well.However, don't trust that little purple to disk to hold that bottle upright, I won't make that mistake again."
4,I like it.,I don't use it excessively but when I use it it does its job. I am happy with this product.
5,Great for a manual pump,"I use both this manual pump and an electric one. Believe it or not, I can express more milk with this one than with my electric pump and it is much gentler. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and lightweight. The only problem I have with it is that it squeaks during use, but that's not so serious as I only use it at home."
3,Served its purpose,This manual pump is good. It has good suction and works well. Comes with spare parts. Only complaint is that for some reason it developed an annoying squeak.
1,"Get the Medela manual, is the better pump","I purchased both the Medela and Lansinoh manual pumps, and found the Medela to be the better pump for a number of reasons:- Lansinoh squeaks when you pump- More parts to dissamble and clean- entirely loses suction if there is even a tiny amount of moisture anywhere in the plastic components- handle does not pivot, less comfortable- plastic looks cheapIn comparison, the Medela is easy to clean, dry and reuse. Will retain suction with a little moisture present. Handle pivots so more comfortable to pump. I found it easier to pump one-handed. It is MUCH quieter. Any basic bottle will screw in. It looks higher quality.The only thing I like better about the Lansinoh is the flange is angled downward and it isn't on the Medela, so milk will spill if you don't lean forward.I wish I didn't buy the Lansinoh. I threw away 30$."
4,Nice stocking stuffer,"My Grandson is a gadget lover and he was always playing with an old optic wonder that I have had for years. So, I got him one as an extra Christmas present. He was happy and played with it all day. These are great toys for kids to look at bugs and other cool things with."
4,Kids love it.,"We got this in the mail for free for my 7 year old. All 4 kids fought over it. The glass fell out very quickly, same day. But glue it cause the toy is so fun for kids and cheap price. I am back to buy 4 more."
3,Nice little toy that could have been better,"I bought two of these, they kids were curious to play with them, using as binocular and scope. But the compass is not really working, it does not always point to North correctly! That was a bummer."
2,Good for beginners...,"OK - a very simple review. We have this book at the office both in the 4 and 5 versions. We also have the Teixeira book (""Developers guide""). Cantu actuallly does a good job for beginners and the text quality is ok. There could easily be some more depth and better (intelligent) examples.We actually have a joke that you *never* find anything in this book. For language reference/tutorial: this is *not* it. For the components: This is definitely *not* it. I really don't know what this is for, except as an introductory overview... in... 1250 pages ! Pretty strange really.So I dunno - nice book but still not very helpful. Does *not* go beyond Delphi's own documentation. Doesn't even cover that much. Your still gonna be looking through source and wondering what's going on here and there.Sidenote: Still haven't found any good book on Delphi components. For language, real-world programming - Teixeira is much better. We ordered the O'reilly book, hope it's good."
2,Maybe A Good Book But Definetely Not 4 Beginners,Maybe in a few months from now (June 2001) i will find this book an excellent one for Delphi. But right now i need a book that explains why his code is doing several things. From my point of view you don't have to already Know Object Pascal and old version of Delphi to read a book that is selfrated as All Levels. So if you are looking for something to start with THIS IS DEFINETELY NOT THE BOOK YOU NEED. Do i have any recommendations for alternatives? Well i don't but i am working on it...
2,Highly Unstructured,"The content is spewed all over the place. The book is not well structured. Cantu knows Delphi extremely well but writing a book is a different ball game than development. Had the book had an excellent editor it would certainly come out better than what it is today. I doubt if the next version covering Delphi 6 is going to be any better.If you are new to delphi or coming from VB than try tom swans book ""delpihi bible"". It is more coherent and structured. For an advanced Delphi book, I have yet to find one that really shines. Most of them are so, so.Overall - yes you will benefit a little if you hang on it long enough and that is where the problem."
3,A lot missing for such a big book!,"This book presents material well, but there is a lot of material that is important to the developer that is missing. Most of the controls are described perfunctarily. Those that are very powerful might at best, get an example of only one way in which they may be used. Several are named, but not described at all.The Master-Detail database relationship is one of the most databasse concepts; but other than a trivial example with a grid, it is not taught.If this is your only Delphi reference, you'll likely be disappointed."
5,"Refreshing, superb blasts of noise...","Somewhere between Sonic Youth and the best of Husker Du, plus loads of their own takes on sonic noise in general, Parts and Labor is one of the better and more innovative post punk bands out there.Smart, clever lyrics are there also in virtually all the songs (My favorites are Stay Afraid, timeline, and Death) but the fractured, downright orchestral bombardment of the soaring arrangements make the album.Most people familiar with Husker Du will notice the connection, but its mainly because they are as different as that band was at blending a certain pop element with very creative high-volume soundscapes.Don't miss this album."
2,Not a great book for homeschoolers...,"I bought this book for my kids, but ended up donating it to our library. If your kids are homeschooled or unvaccinated, you may not care for the overemphasis on the importance of school and vaccinations as basic rights for children (rather than education and health in a more inclusive manner)."
5,Perfect gift for children/families,"I ordered this book for my kids for Christmas, and not only my kids were loving looking it over, but all of the adults in the family too! It opened up a lot of discussions about the different ways people in the world live, and how fortunate we are to have what we do."
1,Cheesy and Horrible,"Im so sorry I purchased this CD. I am a huge fan of Tom Jones, but this CD makes me sorry I spent the money. The songs were all recorded off variety shows from the 70's. Even Tina Turner sounds awful! I should have stayed away from this one and saved the money! by the way, I loved RELOAD, which is a much more current selection of duets."
5,Detailed and easy to understand,"This book is great for beginners in Posix. It is detailed and clear. It gives careful explanation of the major Posix functions and complement them with full source codes which compiles perfectly, making everything easier to understand."
5,A 'need to have' for experts and non-expers,"I first read the book about 6 years ago (2003) when on my MSc studies. A friend lent me the book to read as a basic introduction for thread programming. At that time I was doing projects in Java only, but surprisingly it was so easy to understand Java thread model by reading the book with code samples in C.Two years later, I stayed on PhD studies at the University. Once again I needed to do some parallel processing project. I ordered the book through my library. Once again it became handy. But it still wasn't on my bookshelf - I had to go to the library to have it.This year I said to myself: 'No. If you needed this book so many time, you got to have it on your bookshelf'. So there you go - I bought it as a gift for myself for Christmas 2007."
3,Okayish,"Pros:- Understandable languageCons:- Need better explanations though.Overall, okay for the price, if you arent looking for too much."
5,Excellent book on Pthreads,This book was the best of 4 books that I've read on the topic. The coding examples were all very good and the text covered a great number of topics in the necessary detail (very clear and concise). I just wish I'd read this first -- I wouldn't have needed to read the other three books.
2,Pictures are DEFINITELY deceiving,"I love puzzles and I love working on puzzles. But the picture is the end result I'm going for. I want to work on a puzzle that will have a beautiful picture in the end that I can put up on a wall to look at and appreciate. I thought this would be such a puzzle. The picture they have on this site is beautiful! It almost glows, especially in the parts that are white (bottom of the rocks and clouds) but the image on the actual puzzle is duller than an actual rock. What a bummer! Why put hours of my life into something I'm not even going to life?"
5,A brilliant anti-colonialist novel from a schlock-sci-fi writer,"This is probably Resnick's best novel. (Yes, better than Kirinyaga.) It's certainly his most political. It's a devastating anti-colonial (and anti-neo-colonial) critique, hidden in a damned good sci-fi adventure novel--and with the political points revealed, not through exposition, but through the words and actions of the characters. Even better, Resnick is a very good writer technically, and he creates believable characters.Resnick is best known for his schlock space-opera novels (Santiago, Santiago revisited, Santiago yet again, Santiago one more time, Santiago otra vez, Santiago ad nauseam), and I picked this book up expecting an evening of mindless entertainment. Instead, I got an evening of thought-provocation.It's one of the best sci-fi novels I've read in years, and I read approximately 100 sci-fi novels per year."
2,"Not how I define ""fabulous""","The cover announces ""new styles, new looks, new yarns"". Okay, I'll give them the ""new yarns"" from when these ponchos came around the first time, but the looks and styles are just the same old same old."
2,dont buy,"The women on this tape look like they are stuck in the 80s and in all actuality about five of the seven women have no business being on a video dedicated to large breasted women. The music in it is pretty bad. another negative would be the fact that the girls are all sporting the ""natural"" look. Thank god women these days shave"
5,woooah,this is some fire right here i only speak a lil spanish but man the songs on this just show how latinos are more talented then black and white folks cuse knightowl not only wrote these songs he produced them no.2 is good in my opinon i think every rider should have this bumpin but that is just me LATINO PRIDE WORLD WIDE SCREW PAKASTANIS
3,RIght Parts - Fit Perfect,Our machine is over 25 years old. I thought we were going to trash it. Found the right parts and we are good to go until the grandaughter cooks and we need to replace the entire kitchen.
3,Not included,It is what it is...what it is not is inclusive of the 'pusher' attachment that locks into the feeding tube and must be in place before the unit will work. Just to say...
1,This guys opinion is that it was written for women,"I can sum up the book like this:Women want men to know that they should 1) stop doing the things that annoy women and 2) stop complaining about and learn to love the things women do that annoy us men (after all, she only does them because she loves you and you wouldn't really want her any other way)."
1,My girl friend sent me this book - I dumped her.,"If a woman in my life is going to dangle sex in front of me to get what she wants, she can go stand on the street corner to get other guys to get what she wants.Why do women think men should ""communicate"" like them all the time! Why can't women learn to communicate like men! In general, men don't talk as much, but if women would take the time to stop talking and just listen, maybe they'd ""comminicate"" better with their men.I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this book."
2,Suitable for some but not all,"How to tell if this book is for you:1. The husband is 'baby-sitting' when he is home alone with the kids, while the wife would be just doing her job in that situation,2. the wife is likely to burst into tears when lonely or stressed and need a hug with the husband saying ""I'm here for you""3. the husband thinks he shows love and appreciation for the wife by converting the basement into a rec room.There are many families for whom this book would be a big help. Mine isn't one of them, but maybe yours is. Read a chapter in the library and if it fits then buy it - you need it."
5,TaleSpin Fun!,"I grew up watching TaleSpin and I bought the two DVD sets a few years ago. The series is one of the best cartoons ever made. I only wish that Disney would bring Volume Three out.The episodes in Volume Two:Disc One:A Baloo SwitcherooWhistlestop Jackson, LegendDouble Or NothingFeminine AirLast HorizonsFlight of the Snow DuckSave the TigerThe Old Main and the Sea DuckWar of the WeirdsDisc Two:Captains OutrageousThe Time BanditFor Whom the Bell Klangs - Part OneFor Whom the Bell Klangs - Part TwoCitizen KhanGruel and Unusual PunishmentA Jolly Molly ChristmasMy Fair BalooWaiders of the Worst TweasureDisc Three:Flight School ConfidentialBringing Down BabyfaceJumping the GunsIn Search of Ancient BlundersLouie's Last StandSheepskin DeepPizza Pie In the SkyBaloo ThunderBullethead Baloo"
4,Excellent,"If you're not sure which certification to go for, then this book is for you. It tells you about all certs that are currently available, exam formats(multiple choice questions, etc.), approx. fees, prerequisites, and also the difficulty of obtaining the certs.But if you can read it at a bookstore, you will find that buying this book won't be such a good idea coz by then, you would have decided on which exams to take.The book gets my 4 stars coz it gives you what you'd expect from the title."
4,Meets the Requirements to be a Guide,"Well, it does what it claims.It describes the certifications available by vendor. Short, to the point descriptions, usually not longer than a page, for each certification.Format is basically:""XXX Corp Certification"" Who needs it... Requirements for certification... Where to take the test... Cost of test... Format of test...And that's about all the info you'll get for each certification covered in this book.It includes info for (from inside cover) certifications from: Ascend, Adobe, Banyan, Bay Networks, Borland, Centura, Cisco, Compaq, CompTIA, CA, Corel, HP, IBM, Informix, Learning Tree, Lotus, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, Prosoft, SCO, Silicon Graphics, Sun, Sybase, USWeb, Xylan.I didn't give it 5 stars because it is really a cut-dry book, very to the basics and to the point book. Very dry so it's not interesting reading. But it'll give you the facts your looking for."
5,Concise place to find pertinent info.,Has answers to the questions about almost every IS certification available all in one book. Excellent tool for finding direction.
4,Amazingly Candid for a former government official,The ATF is an agency hated by right wing superconservatives and nothing short of a rabid expose would please that crowd. But this author has revealed unknown flaws in that agency along with numerous well-documented achievements hitherto unknown to the public.
1,Not very good at all,"His book displays too many prejudicial notions about various classes of people, and should not be taken seriously. The author should focus on proven facts the next time he writes such a text.Too many allegations, not enough proof!"
4,LEA,"A very engaging history of one of America's most misunderstood federal law enforcement agencies. From the early days of prohibition to the bombing of the World Trade Center, the individual casehistories presented give the reader a true sense of how law enforcement operates. Much of the book is written from first-hand knowledge."
1,A Love Poem for One of the Most Brutal Federal Agencies,"This book was written by former agent, Jim Moore, in an attempt to portray the BATF as a well trained, lawfully authorized, federal law enforcement agency. Nothing could be further from the truth. This agency, armed tax collectors, which has now been authorized to investigate ""suspicious fires"" in the wake of the church burnings across the nation, is a blight on constitutional law. Mr. Moore's paean to his former agency is sophomoric, poorly written, and frankly, disgusting in light of the many innocent people killed and jailed by this agency yearly."
2,Flawed book on an important subject,"The BATF has been much in the news but very few serious studies have been published on its history or operations. As a former ATF agent, the author is in a position give an honest perspective from the ""inside"". However, given the often hysterical accusations thrown at the FBI, NRA, and others, this reader fears that he lost his battle to be objective."
3,I would have given 5 stars if not for the errors,"This book would be the single best resource for passing the CCIE written, but...the mistakes! Some mistakes are minor typos, but others are providing the WRONG information. For example, the section on source route bridging teaches that the length field is for the size of the route descriptors. WRONG!!! the length field is for the size of the entire RIF field INCLUDING the RC and the RD's. I had several questions on the CCIE written that I would have gotten wrong if I wasn't aware the the info provided in the book was wrong. I still very much liked the book, and I owe it a lot of credit for having passed the CCIE written."
4,Excellent Like CCNA Study Guide,"This is excellent for us who want to learn on Cisco Routers and Switches and who are interested on CCIE exams. Certainly this is the best book, well written most of the topics, easy approach.I am an MCSE with reasonable router experiences. I have found this helpful. Thanks"
3,"Okay as your first study tool, but not an all in one source","This book is only good for a cursory review of the topics. The book seems light in detail and has lots of errors. As a general starter, read this book a couple of times and then delve into the recommend reading lists and web pages at CCO. That amount of info will help you pass the written. I just passed the CCIE written today and used this book as my first study resource but not my only!!! It is an easy read and only the BGP chapter seemed to have the most depth. The tests also have errors. With a little more work, depth and accuracy this book has the potential to be your all in one source for the exam. The next edition may be better as an all in one reference, so supplement your studies with other material!! Good luck all."
3,This book is not an accurate all in one source,"This book is only good for a cursory review of the topics. The book seems light in detail and has lots of errors. As a general starter read this book a couple of times and then delve into the recommend reading lists and web pages at CCO. That amount of info will help you pass the written. I just passed the CCIE written today and only used this book as my first study resource but not my last!!!. It is an easy read and the BGP chapter only seemed to have the most depth. The tests also have errors. With a little more work, depth and accuracy this book has the potential to be your all in one source for the exam. The next edition may be better as an all in one reference, so supplement your studies with other material!! Good luck all."
3,Do not use for today's CCIE R&S test - or yesterday's!,"I usually feel that a Todd Lammle book is a book to take seriously. While studying for the CCIE Routing & Switching (R&S;), I purchased this book anticipating a book worthy of the Lammle title. While I was not too disappointed, I did not feel the book offered any information that I could not find elsewhere. Also, while the book gave a good intro for most subjects (ISDN, Frame-Relay, NAT), I do not feel one would be able to walk away from the CCIE as feeling like you passed solely on this book. I would not place this book within the top 15 books to use for the CCIE. For example - on page 327, how can one show a table of possible protocols found in the protocol field of an IP Header WITHOUT including TCP (protocol 6) and UDP (protocol 17). On the flip side, I did feel that the books discussion was a good intro to BGP - a topic which usually takes books to explain.I give this book 3 pings out of 5:!!..!"
2,Check the Blueprint for R&S Written,"Check the Cisco blueprint for R&S exam, be sure that the books you use cover all listed topics...some cover routing protocols and switching adequately but don't cover QoS and Multiservice, for example. Cisco's website is also a great study resource for the new R&S written exam."
4,Does not fit for the new exam!!!!,"i read this book and just faild the new ccie written exam, no matter this is a good book, also there are a lot of mistakes in it, it is worth reading it! But don't feel prepared to take the new ccie written test."
3,Use this book along with others,"This book does an excellent job of laying down a foundation for the CCIE candidate to build on. Many books out there go into so much detail, they're overwhelming. This book covers the basics, and hints at more. One word of warning: there are a few errors in the sample questions, and DEFINITELY double-check the section on RIF's. All in all, I found this book useful, and I passed the Written by reading it and cross-referencing a few other books."
2,"Good book, but not enough","I succeeded on my second CCIE written test. I bought this book after I failed my first attempt. Over all, this is a very good book. It describes the networking theory in a way that's different from other books, which made it easier to understand the concept. But it doesn't have the depth needed to pass the test."
2,A sloppy job,Looks like the authors were in a big hurry. Too many errors to consider this book a good choice for a CCIE exam. I am really thinking about returning this book.
3,"Okay, but the next revision should be complete","This book is only good for a cursory review of the topics. The book seems light in detail and has lots of errors. As a general starter read this book a couple of times and then delve into the recommend reading lists and web pages at CCO. That amount of info will help you pass the written. I just passed the CCIE written today and used this book only as my first study resource but not my only!!!. It is an easy read and only the BGP chapter seemed to have the most depth. The tests also have errors. With a little more work, depth and accuracy this book has the potential to be your all in one source for the exam. The next edition may be better as an all in one reference, so supplement your studies with other material!!! Good luck all."
3,Errors,"Good Book if you can get past all the errors. I even found notes left, to author himself. I have never seen so many errors. I began to doubt most of the text.Why can't someone just audit the book before publishing and catch all these errors?Terrible."
1,Too many technical errors to recommend as a study guide,"This book appears to have gone through the publication process without any technical review. The errors were too many to count, involving diagrams that didn't match their discriptions, invalid answers to test questions, technically inaccurate information and in some cases contradictory information. For instance, the one table in the book that listed the reserved/private ip address ranges had them wrong. If I could ask for my money back for this book I would.The one positive that I think you could take from this book would be to read it as a way of testing your knowledge. If you read through it and find all the errors you are probably ready to take the written.I would recommend the Jeff Doyle TCP/IP routing books, the Caslow Bridges, Routers and Switches, and the Exam Cram Routing and Switching as better resources. I passed the CCIE written on the first try."
3,Thought-provoking but little else.,"Max Oelschlaeger examines the politics of wilderness and history of interaction between humans and nature. He takes us through the history of wilderness philosophy as well. Oelschlaeger walks a fine line between historian and philosopher. I enjoyed reading the book for the simple fact it inspired me to examine my own take on wilderness. However, the book is not for the faint of heart and even the truest academics will need to keep a dictionary handy while trudging through Oelschlaeger's work. Extremely well researched and a must in the library of anyone truely interested in wilderness and its impact on the human race."
2,Too wordy and philosophical,I don't like this book at all - it's way too philosophical and the author is too wordy. Instead of stating concise statements he draws his ideas out for pages. Not worth my time to read.
3,Academic Writing for Academics,Pity Dr. Oelschlaeger finds need to over-intellectualize. Here he seems/ed to be writing for peer review -- other academics. Too bad. Enjoy your retirement. Others are still fighting the good fight.
2,RoftheJ is a cut version,"I read the other review for this double movie, and the BB Return of the Joker is the edited version. I doubled checked it by looking at the joker flashback scene and comparing it to a website that showed the different events between the editions. I don't know how much it matters that it is edited, but the other reviews for the main movie amazon listing recommend getting the uncut version. Also on the dvd, it says the movie is 76 minutes which might be correct for the uncut version but might be incorrect for this cut version.I assume mystery of the batwoman is fine so you might want to buy the double movie if it is cheaper than just mystery of the batwoman."
5,GREAT!!!,Great product!! Very happy with the durability.I use this cover when I am at work.And I have nothing bad to say!
4,Way to go Jack,"I like Jack Ballas. Not because he's a member of DFW Writer's Workshop, but that when Jack writes you can feel the tension, the romance, the excitement. I don't read many books but Jack is one of those writers I love to listen to."
3,Questionable content,"Although the music is wonderful in this movie, I hesitate to show this to younger students. It really discusses the issue of wife/child abuse and stealing more so than Strauss's music. The wife and child in this movie are beaten by the husband (although it doesn't show it exactly, it is hinted). Strauss and the boy also talk through this abuse. It also does mention a ""beer hole."" I prefer the Liszt and Handel videos in this series to show to students - nothing questionable and more entertaining."
4,"Wonderful modern symphonies - lovers of Prokofiev, Gorecki, Nyman should enjoy this CD.","I really enjoyed this music - exotic rhythms and sometimes turbulent harmonies blended with European and Eastern color. To me, Ince's musical language sounds like a mix between Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Gorecki, and Nyman. The recording is a bit heavy on the percussion and brass and less so on the strings, but it is otherwise well engineered. Don't expect a sonata allegro form to these symphonies. They are more like programmatic episodes but the over all impression is of a creative composer with a talent for programmatic musical expressions. I look forward to hearing other music by this composer."
4,Like it,I ordered this jacket along with another style at the same time. The L is very Large I had to send it back and get a Medium. It fits correctly now. I would buy from them again.
5,South Florida,I live in Southern FL. and this jacket worked great while fishing the flats. It is light and breathable and easy to store away.
4,Runs Big,"The jacket is Great. Good quality, as described on the web.However, I had a large windbreaker that I was replacing, so I ordered my Stormbreaker in a size medium... and it was bigger than the large I already had. So they tend to run really big."
5,turfer for unbelievable quality and value!,"this is my second jacket purchase from turfer...i couldn't be more satisfied with the product's quality and value...excellent, excellent manufacturer...don't hesitate, buy from turfer...i know it's not a ""big name"" company, but who cares when they offer incredible merchandise at great prices...a gem in outerwear apparel!!!"
4,Great Bargain,"This was a great purchase. The price was extremely reasonable, and the jacket performed superbly even in a driving Scotland rainstorm! I would definitely recommend this jacket."
2,(Not what I expected) Update!!,"After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.Ok, this earlier review was done before I started wearing the jacket. It is very light and flimsy but does a really good job of keeping you warm. My earlier review may have been somewhat unfair. Now I say this jacket is definitely worth the price!"
2,NOT True to Size--Way too BIG !!!,"Turfer quality and price is excellent. I have bought a lot of Turfer items over the years...Recently howeversizing has become a big issue for Turfer. I have a 50 inch waist and 36 inch long arms. The waist on this jacket was about 12 inches too big. The arms were 6+ inches too long. Does Turfer think us 3X guys really have62 inch waists and 42 inch long arms? Who are they making this stuff for??? The Jolly Green Giant? If this garment was true to size, I would rate it FIVE STARS *****"
3,"Not as packable as hoped, seems to be well made","I was looking for a thinner, lighter rain jacket for our son to keep on his bike or in his binder in case he got caught in the rain, the zippers and buttons are too bulky for this ... seems to be well made, the material seems light enough but with all the reinforcing and stitching and extras like the flap, it does not cram down as well as had hoped ... should give good performance and last ... haven't actually used it .. quit raining when we got it .... should be warm enough for cool rainy days in NW Florida .. it does get cold here in the fall / winter ... 6th grader son seems to like how it looks and fits .. bought him the adult medium ... may run small for adults, check other reviews ... he does wear adult medium shirts ..."
3,A valuable jacket,1 point down because it is not brand name /w really good material. 1 more point down because it is fashionless.
1,"Mastering the ""Basics"" of Windows 98","This is a very long and expensive book for people who have never previously encountered a drop-down menu, and who might benefit from an explanation of the intricacies of mouse clicking. I expected 1623 pages and two CDs would do more than describe dialog boxes. I expected technical insights that would aid me in troubleshooting--and find myself disappointed."
3,Registry & Troubleshooting Lacky,"I found this book helpful in many ways to understanding the intermediate functions of Windows 98. What I found this book lacking was the most intregate part of W98, the Registry. There wasnt even a few pages dedicated to the most crucial function of the OS. The other problem was no troubleshooting section. This book was misnamed from the start. Nothing ""Mastering"" about this book. That is unless you want to learn how to ""point"" and ""drag"" your way around. This book clearly should have been named ""Basic""Windows 98!"
2,"""Mastering"" should be removed from the title","To ""master"" a subject means to ""become an expert"". After reading this book, on whose back cover is displayed ""Thorough Coverage of ... Advanced Windows 98 Topics"", you will not, in my opinion, have mastered Windows 98. In order to ""master"" any subject you have to find out ""what is under the hood"". The author devotes only SIX pages to the subject of the Registry! How can you ""master"" Windows 98 without a thorough understanding of the Registry? ""Using Windows 98"" would be a more appropriate title. I'm returning my copy for a full refund."
2,Far too basic for the its size.,"This book may be useful for someone who is upgrading from windows 3.1 but if you have had any contact with windows 95 or 98 it is far too basic. A great amount of time and space is granted to describing every window. I was expecting more in depth coverage of windows 98. Everytime I have tried to reference something in this book, I have come up with no answers. At the very least the book could have benefited from a decent glossary and appendices."
4,This combo set is truely one of a kind.,"I found that the video gave a lot of interesting information on the origin and theory behind each of the massages they described. Not only that, but it also included many different massage strokes for the four different types of message; Swedish, Reflexology, Tui Na, and Shiatsu. Along with these massages were easy to follow charts on the different meridians for accupressure. With this instructional video and relaxing cd I now feel like a pro."
1,"Terrible quality, cheap-looking","I was amazed when I received these earrings, thinking that they would look like the picture online. They are the cheapest-looking earrings--the silver was tarnished in certain places, giving a ""patchy"" look; the posts weren't soldered on correctly, so they stuck out at weird angles. DO NOT BUY from this company! You will regret it. Amazing they can get away with it."
1,missing disk,"I bought this from a store well over a year ago for a future birthday gift. When I gave if to the person the third disk was missing. Since it was over a year I purchased it, I did not keep the receipt. I emailed Warner but have not gotten any response. Does any one know how to get the third disk ?"
4,Mindless fun,"Stop the pigeonStop the pigeonStop the pigeonHowww?Nab himJab himStab himGrab himStop that pigeon now!Dick Dastardly and his dog Muttley are hard not to love. They have a great love hate relationship. The show can get monotonous at times, but overall it is just a fun show to sit down and relax to. If you are a Hanna-Barbera fan, then this one you should add to your collection."
4,Classic Cartoon,I have not had a chance to watch yet but I ordered with the Wacky Races series. I have really been enjoying the Wacky Races series and I am sure the Dastardly & Muttley in their Flying Machines will be just as good.
5,FANTASTIC DVD COLLECTION -- DASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES!,Product was reasonably priced and arrived quickly. All of the shows in this collection are on the DVDs and very entertaining.
2,You can't go home again...,"When I saw this, i got very excited. i remember as a child watching these cartoons with great delight and looking forward to the next Saturday morning when i could watch them again. so i ordered this. I guess the rose colored glasses of childhood can cloud your vision. These are just stupid. they offer none of the quick wit and subtle humor of the Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry offerings. this might work for seven year olds, but I guess I'm just getting old and jaded."
3,Mindless fun,"""Dastardly & Muttley In Their Flying Machines"" was no work of genius as was classic Road Runner cartoons (considering Mike Maltese was a writer for both entities), but given the climate of Saturday morning cartoons in 1969, it was acceptable. A spin-off of the previous year's ""Wacky Races,"" ""Dastardly & Muttley"" still possessed the audacity to try to be funny in the old-fashioned cartoon sense, and not script-driven teenage sleuth shows that would follow (D&M went straight from outline to storyboard). TV budgets that Hanna-Barbera worked with certainly wouldn't allow D&M to be as funny as classic WB cartoons, but it would be unfair to compare it unfavorably to them. It harkens back to a time way before grossouts, toilet humor and double entendres became cartoon standards."
4,Enjoyable Collection,"Although it has been several years since I read this collection, it went on my short list of about twenty books I'd like to own and purchase copies for family members. Nicely paced, imaginative, enjoyable stories. Paint a vivid picture of a time and place."
1,Chen tai chi,"The teacher is a grand master, that's fine, but:The form is interrupted with demonstrations, so you have to wind and rewind.I regret to have bought the video.I do not recommend it for learning purposes, sorry."
4,shampoo help,This is a great product when you have cararact surgery and can't get water in you eyes for a period of time. It is also useful when you have a prolonged hospital stay. Happy shampooing!ps my hair dresser recommended this and I am grateful!
2,No Rinse Shampoo,"I have a kid who's skins is so sensitive to water, so I thought this would help her ....Problem is you have to add water to it in order for it to work....Waste of my money."
1,"did not get the cleaner, u sent me 2 polishers, i order 1 of each","i did not get the cleaner, u sent me 2 polishers i order 1 of each so i keep the 2,"
4,Very Good Book,"This is a very good book for anyone willing to understand Cisco routing (CCNA/CCNP).Of course some people may find it ""the poorest book ever written on Cisco Routing"";It all depends on how you read books and what you are expecting from it.This book is an easy to understand way to handle complexity."
5,Christian Alternative to the Harry Potter Series,"Quite Simply the best Christian Book for kids out there right now. It has adventure, romance, and a plot so thick that you'll want to read it again and again. If your child reads Harry Potter, get them hooked on the Dar's Quest series--then they'll leave Harry."
4,Children need more good books.,I heard Mr. Alexander on the radio and ordered a copy for my kids to read. They both enjoyed the book thoroughly and seemed to have gotten a lot out of it. I'm very protective of what they do read and liked the idea that Mr. Alexander had written this in a way that was kid friendly and spiritual. We need more books like this.
3,Dick's Wallet,"Unfortunately, I am returning the nylon tri-fold wallet to Coldkeepers because it is not ""roomy"" enough.My husband asked for a new nylon tri-fold billfold, for his birthday, to replace his trusty - but worn-out - Rolf's which he's had for many years. I simply could not find a Rolf's nylon wallet anywhere in our local store, so I got on line and thought what I was ordering was going to be like the Rolf's. Unfortunately, he cannot get his credit cards into the compartments. It is just a smidgen too small.Oh well."
1,wallet was not what it looked like,"this was for my husband to replace an old one , the left side of the open wallet looked like it had a top pocket which he likes for his cards but it is not a top open pocket so he is not using it and we are still on the search for a new wallet to replace his old falling apart one!"
2,Not iPod Compatible,"This card works great with everything except the ipod. I bought this card specifically to use with my new 5G ipod only to find (after well over an hour on the phone with tech support) that this card is not WHQL certified. Ipod and ipod mini require WHQL certified USB 2.0 cards. The long and short is: This card will not work with your 5G ipod. On the upside, it works great with my firewire and USB2.0 back-up drives..."
4,A little help,"I have developped com objects for a while and have decided to migrate to Visual Basic. I found this book vague, but well written. Not enough practical material was covered. Much more attention to detail would've made this book better."
4,Turandot in Beijing! What more need be said!,"Though not the strongest vocal cast ever compiled, this version of Turandot rewards with its staging in ""The Forbidden City."" The chorus is massive, the performers passionate and the pace by Maestro Mehta, excellent! If you are seeking the spectacle of Turandot in its proper setting, this is what you're looking for!"
4,Packaging Has Some Flaws,"This set is a great set, they did a real nice job on restoring these films into HD. They are filled with extras complete with nice menus. The only drawback is the packaging and that goes for all the volumes and not just this one. They come in this little book and the device that holds the discs in place are these little foam buttons that are just glued to the package. They are really flimsy and you need to be careful taking the disc out because I once took the button completely off. I don't know why they had to go for such a unique look and couldn't just put them in simple trays like most dvds do."
5,"Bond, James Bond",Got this one for my son's birthday. He loves James Bond! He had gotten the first two sets for Christmas last year. He seems to be pretty happy with the quality of the picture and sound of the bluray disc. I believe he likes Sean Connery the best but he has enjoyed Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan in the role. I grew up with Sean Connery so he has become my all time favorite. I'm surprised they haven't relased them in order of their release but I guess this makes more sense. This way you get all the different Bond actors. Nice packaging! Goes with vol 1 &2.
4,"James Bond, the best it's ever been","I absolutely recommend this product for any and all James Bond fans out there. The video is staggering and the audio is equally impressive. ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"" will blow your mind. A person with no knowledge of the films could not tell you they are nearly a half century old. My only complaint are the titles they chose for this first wave. I really like ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Thunderball"", but some of the others are weaker films in the series, but if you're a Bond fan this is a must-own for the video and audio upgrades alone."
5,The Greatest James Bond Set Ever,"I have this DVD set and let me tell you one thing. I love it. I am a huge James Bond fan and for all the other James Bond fans out there, I recommend that you buy this set. You'll definetly get your moneys worth on it."
3,"Excellent remasters, poor packaging","I noted this in a review for Vol 2. I keep seeing people either fawning over the packaging, or complaining about pooer quality.Yes they have slip covers. Plastic slip covers. OK...Yes they have faux-leather booklets. Very little cover art or information within, and the discs are held in with pieces of foam that are glued to the packaging.There are several accounts of these foam plugs either breaking/disintegrating or becoming unglued.In my case, I opened the first Volume and 2 disks fell to the floor.The actual movies themselves are incredible and very enjoyable. But the packaging is really cheap. I'd give this collection a 5/5 but not with packaging that lets discs fall out when you first open it up and leaves these beautiful movies loose in sub-par packaging."
3,"If you get them to play, the movies are excellent","You've read (or are about to read) about the ridiculous foam holder for the discs and the high quality of the movies. I just tried two of the three movies on two different Blu-ray players in my house that play every Blu-ray I throw at them, except for the two Bond movies from this collection. One is a high-end Panasonic and the other a PS3. The PS3 at least got to the menu. But when I selected ""Mission"" to start the movie, the PS3 tried to play the movie but returned to the top-level menu. I then installed the latest update on the PS3 (V. 3.01) that was just released and now the two movies play. It seems it takes the latest firmware update to ensure that ALL (some do play, others don't) will play in a PS3 player. I don't know if once I update the Panasonic the movie will play. Clearly there is an encoding error. It takes smart enough firmware to decode the faultily encoded discs. A total pain in the butt and should have been unnecessary."
1,Great movies. Horrible compatibility issues.,"These movies look truly astounding, assuming you can get them to play on your Blu-ray player. Many hang on black screens, others get stuck in the menu, some don;t even make it that far.Its not just Sony players, there are irate threads about these 6 bond Blu-ray discs all over the net and the same exact problems are happening on a whole slew of players (Sony's, LG's, Samsungs, Panasonics), even with the most recent firmware updates. It's most likely the discs themselves that are at fault but does it really matter whose fault it is?The end result is a big fat black eye for Blu-ray. The Blu-ray Disc Association, the hardware manufacturers, and the content producers need to get their act together."
3,James Bond 7 Pack DVDs,I have always enjoyed James Bond movies. And it was great to have them in DVD format. The only conplaint I have is both the Goldfinger and Goldeneye DVD would not run. I have had the set replaced and continued to have the same problem. Anyone with any ideas about what maybe wrong.My DVD player stops in the very beginning. I've emailed MGM DVD but have not received a response.
2,Bad information,"This has become a frustration for blu-ray devices. I was excited to have the discs and then found that not every one of them played on my system. This is not the way to provide customer support.The working discs have an amazing picture and sound, I'm not sure that it is worth the frustration to continue buying the Bond discs.I have a blu-ray player with my computer. There was no firmware update available for the player. I did try a software update of the media player (Cyberlink PowerDVD) but that did nothing. I ended up buying a copy of WinDVD and that played the discs. This was after several nights of searching the Web and finding information.I have decided to not buy a standalone player for blu-ray. It would have been useless and frustrating to spend that much money and not see anything."
4,"Name is Bond, James Bond.","This is a god set for collectors with an attractive box and good variety of Bond films. The only thing it lacks is George Lazernby. This set has all of the Bonds except him. All of the movies have their own flavor and level of action. The Bonds are all diferent as well. Sean Connery being the rough and cool secret agent with all the right moves. Roger Moore being the more romantic and wittier. Timothy Daulton being the roughest of the Bonds with a more ruthless edge. Pierce Brosnan possibly being the best Bond with the ruggedness of Connery and the witt of Moore. All of the Bonds are great, but it still could have had George Lazernby."
1,The DVD sucked,"I don't know what is the problem but the DVD won't work it gets stuck at the Menu part. I would like to return it, the rest of the DVDs were fine.=("
5,License To Kill,I have not seen all of the James Bond movies but I think this is one of the best.It has alot of action and it has a good plot.I think Timothy Dalton did a great job.You should buy this video.
5,Bond Forever,"The movies of James Bond have become more exciting over the years. Starting with Sean Connery, I would say that the character(James Bond) has not really changed. The actions of Connery, Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all help to make 007 come alive. All movies in this set are wonderful and many people are looking forward to the next two sets."
1,Inaudito!!!!,"La compra realizada por Amazon la hice el 3 de Junio del 2011, es 18 de Julio y no ha llegado el pedido pese a que segun Amazon llegaria el 4 de Julio.Que paso?"
1,BAD!!,I just got it and I hate it because It's bad package and not worth it to buy it! There is no fancy cases!
1,CURIOSITY ALSO COST MONEY.NOT WORTH THE CHANGE,"About 1 year ago, I bought the Ultimate bond collection on DVD & they looked great, 5 stars!!!So when the BD came out, I bought them, thinking how much better will they look?When I put that BD disc of DR.NO in my PS3, witch they all work fine BTW,& the menu came on that screen my face dropped of dissapointment.It was the same menu as the regular DVD's the only difference is that the special features are on the same disc,The video quality was the same as the regular DVD's.I was thinking those cheap S.O.B at MGM OR FOX !!!I'm sure all they did was a transfer from DVD to BD, just like the old days LASERDISCS TO DVD, sound familiar guys? The reviews from all those websites were great, but I guess they never compared them to the DVD's.I also have some issues with the boxes but whatever.Don't get me wrong they do look great, and if you never had the DVD's, sure go for the BD,but it will cost you,a lot more.Steve H."
1,James Bond Vol 1 & 2 Blu Ray Disk Collection,"This is an otherwise great collection. However, even after Amazon replaced the whole set once for me, ""For Your Eyes Only"" still will not play past the opening copyright page, in spite of trying it on several players (Sony & Samsung) with the most up-to-date software.This is a black eye for Quality Control at MGM & Amazon.com. I am now reluctant to purchase any BD on Amazon.com, even though this is not necessarily their fault. Better perhaps to go to a local retailer where one can make a direct exchange if there is a problem with a Blu Ray Disk.Jim AmosMililani, HawaiiJames Bond Blu-ray Collection Six-Pack (Dr. No / Die Another Day / Live and Let Die / For Your Eyes Only / From Russia with Love / Thunderball) (Amazon.com Exclusive) [Blu-ray]"
1,Why bother?,"Anybody get these to work on Samsung BD-P1000? I've updated to latest firmware and still nothing. I'm so mad I could scream, what good did it do to pick a system (Blu-ray vs. HD) and still have this kind of garbage? Seems to me Amazon and/or Fox/MGM could at least provide a list of which players they will work with, otherwise why bother?"
1,James Bond Blu Ray Volume 2,"First and probably last blu ray purchase. I Bought a HP laptop with blu ray for playing blu ray on trips and its my only player. This Bond collection was my first blu ray purchase. multiple updates of software later I still can only play 2 out of 3 of the discs. For your eyes only. Gives me a fbi warning and a commentary warning and goes to black. On top of that my home hd tv is not supported because it doesn't have hdcp? I paid to much for my home tv to replace it just for a new media format. I am sticking with DVD, and online services."
3,Not bad...it should contain..more of the originals,"I liked it , but its not worth the price listed. I am a great james bond fan, but this disapionts me a little, but over all its still good to an extent."
3,so far so good,product arrived in good condition.looks good.still have to watch goldfinger and thunderball.all of the dvds have deleted scenes and documentaries.
5,"Great movies, great for a collection. Have to upgrade your blue ray player",Great movies...you need to upgrade(download) your blue ray player in order to watch these movies
2,Bought too soon,"I thought I was happy with this purchase until shortly after my purchase Amazon offered the same set, only in proper DVD packaging for $5.00 less for the package! Doesn't make sense to me!!"
1,Avoid if you want the book like package,"If your after just the movies find them separately which is how this volume 3 is packaged. Otherwise this set should price out at around 15.00 USD, no more. The only movie of note is Goldfinger the other two are, imho, mediocre Bond movies at best. Very disappointed that Amazon doesn't use a different picture for this volume. It makes it seem that it's just like the first two and nothing is further from the truth."
2,"You like James Bond Gimmick's, you wont like this.","What on earth possesed the makers to present a boxed set in this order, no consistancy or method in this madness. You have all the glory of Bond but why o why not start with the magnificent Dr. No. I personally think that this boxed set has missed a highly profitable marketing strategy here by offering this mis-match of the master spy. I would wait in hope that some-one sees sense and produces a boxed set in order of time, and not order of some meglomaniac Bond villian.Other than that if you are a Bond die hard (sorry) then these are for you, in all there glory, however at a price!!."
1,Samsung Player and 007 shook me and stirred me crazy,"I have a Samsung Home Theatre player that is brand new with no firmware updates available. I could only get bits and pieces of the 007 blu-ray to play. This is the first blu ray DVD I have bought that hasn't played. Rambo, Hellboy II, some wife flicks have all worked fine. This was a bad day of adventure."
3,Region Code,Can anyone write the region code of these films.Please help.Most of the out f stock at uk.And also why not Amazon gives the region codes
4,007 DVD Review (Blue-Ray),"All DVDs had clear and sharp images and the sound was great.I was a bit disappointed that although in Blu-Ray, the movie images did not fill the entire vertical screen. Most of my other Blu-Ray movies fill the entire screen, both horizontally and vertically."
1,will not play on Samsung BD-P1200 blu-ray player,Does not play on my Samsung BD-P1200 Blu-Ray player with the latest (June 2008) firmware.
4,Great Gift!,Got this for my dad as a Christmas gift and he loves it. He has the whole collection on Blu-Ray. Restored quality for the films is good too. He watches it all the time. Great gift for Father's Day!!
3,"Problems playing ""For Your Eyes Only"" on Blu-ray","I bought the first two sets of James Bond on Blu-ray, but for some reason one movie,""For Your Eyes Only"", doesn't play on my Blu-ray machine even though I do have the latest software updates. I had no problems playing any of these though on my friend's PS3.I do have one small beef also with the packaging. I like the book format inside, and the design of the aperture box, but the use of foam centers to hold the discs seems a bit lame, and I wonder how long it will be before these centers pull off.All of the other movies that do play are fine and enjoyable to watch in Blu-ray."
5,"Shaken, stirred and with a center of pure vodka","This is by far the BEST DVD-collection set I have ever seen. Not just because I am a Bond fanatic, but also because this collection leaves me speechless. Every single movie in this box is filled the brink with extras of every sort. Almost all the movies has 2 feature lenght commentary tracks, long making-of documentaries and so so SO much more. If you are thinking about buying this set, do yourself a favour, stop thinking and DO IT! You will NOT regret it. Two more sets are coming, and if they are as good as this one, then MGM are the masters of DVD."
3,Disappointed,"2 of the 7 DVDs are not Dolby Digital 5.1. Live and Let Die and GoldFinger are only English Mono sound. What a rip off especially since the details of this fact are hidden on Amazon's description. The other 5 DVDs are fabulous. Surprisingly, Thunderball (1965) has a great Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track. Why couldn't they redo the best one: Live and Let Die."
1,"Movies -5 stars, Packing - unacceptable","It is unfortunate that such poor packing can potentially damage DVDs. It almost falls apart when you even look at it. You should not send DVDs/CDs this way, and it's not Amazon's fault, they did their best."
4,"great, good and so-so Bond but when will they give us a boxed set for each Bond?","I'm of two minds about this set. You get one movie from three different Bonds: Pierce Brosnan (the silly The World Is Not Enough, his weakest entry), Roger Moore (Moonraker, also not his best) and Sean Connery (Goldfinger, the greatest Bond film of them all and the mold for all the Bonds that would follow). The good news is that the films look simply amazing; they have been restored with tremendous care and loaded down with extras. The bad news is that it's such a random collection of Bond movies that don't really belong together. All you do is frustrate fans. Anyone who would buy this would also buy the complete Sean Connery set or the complete Roger Moore set and surely that's the only logical way to package them? Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,One DVD won't load,One of the DVDs in this box set won't load. Amazon doesn't seem willing to do anything about it other than sending you a new box set that has the same problem. They should provide compensation or work with the vendor to get the problem fixed.
3,Nice collectible set,These are three classic Bond films so I won't go into their plots. The transfers are great and audio sound wonderful. Book disc holder is a nice touch unfortunately Vol 3 doesn't come with that packaging just Vol 1 and this.
5,others to come....,"All these are excellent examples of James Bond at his best. As other reviews point out, there is someone missing, as well as other favorites... But check out the James Bond website and it will tell you when the others are being released in their own sets and offers a link back to Amazon to get them when available. They're releasing three different boxed sets over this next year, to cover all the movies. Enjoy!"
4,007 Blue Ray,Just received the discs yesterday finished watching volume 1 image is incredible at least 10 times sharper than the ultimate set that was released in 2006. Dr No is 46 years old (!) and it looks as if it was released today. Now I gave it 4 stars because of the load time issue that many people is experiencing is due to the BD-J coding that is in these discs. Check dvdfile.com for full explanation of what J coding is. Keep writing to the studios & manufactors the problem is correctable.
5,Plays fine on Panasonic DMP-BD30K and PQ is 5-star quality,I gave this set 5-stars not only because I experienced no problems playing them (unlike slightly more than half of the reviewers here) but also because the pciture quality for these 6 Bond films was the best I've ever seen. These also play on my PS3 fine with the latest firmware update. I highly recommend this set if you enjoy watching Bond films at their finest. This was also not a bad buy for me since I was able to get all 6 films for just about half this current price from Amazon.com (thanks Amazon for occasionally having really great sales and to blu-ray.com for letting me know about it).
2,Separate the Bonds please!,"How about a Sean Connery only pack of blu-rays (and other Bonds in their separate packs)? It shouldn't be that hard to do, with the exception of ""Never Say Never Again"", they would be in sequence from Dr.No onward. Just for those of us who didn't care for Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton or George Lazanby. I'd probably get the Pierce Brosnan pix also............."
1,Blu ray Blues,Blu ray collectors are getting just what they deserve! They wanted Blu Ray to win when we should have been fighting for compatibility instead of dominance. Now we all lose. Even my Blu ray of the Hulk does not play correctly on my older Blu ray player. What we as consumers should have been fighting for is to be able to play any disc on any player. Now our investments are blown.
2,2 of 7 are in mono!,"Don't believe the technical spec's shown on this website, or most of the reviews - 2 of the 7 movies, GoldFinger and Live and Let Die are NOT remastered, they are the same mediocre quality prints that UA has been selling for 3 years! Furthermore those same two movies are not video remastered either. Both GF and LALD have scratches, glitches and pops in the video.These two movies are an embarrasment to United Artists.The other 5 movies are quite good. Great video and phenomenal audio. OK why can they get a great dolby digital 5.1 audio mix on Thunderball (1966) but not GF (1964) or LALD (1973)?!?Personally I am returning the set and will just buy the good ones, one at a time."
4,I've got all the volumes....,"I've gotten all the volumes as they've come out. My dad loves them, and the quality is superb. Got 2 around Christmas for super cheap, like 45 dollars for two volumes. Best place to buy and they arrived nicely packaged and new."
3,Informative,"It took a little getting into this book, but overall I found it very interesting and well-written. Brackman had a huge undertaking in trying to write about the whole two and a half year trial. It is rather confusing in some places, with all the legal jargon and whatnot, but I think that Brackman did a good job given the hugeness of his task."
4,The story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial,"Everyone knows the story of the Nuremberg Trials but today the story of the Tokyo Trials is largely forgotten outside of Japan. The Allies who prosecuted the Pacific War held trials of Japan's war leaders on the same legal basis as those of the Nazis following the end of WWII. This book, written by a reporter who was present during the proceedings, looks at international law and the violations of it while Japan attempted to take over Asia. Also, the Japanese government's involvment in narcotics trafficing and both large-scale and small-scale atrocities directed at the civilian populations and POWs was addressed during the trials.While imperfect, the trials not only established the criminal behavior of Japan's government but determined the punishment of key leaders involved. The war guilt of Emperor Hirohito was never addressed (or addressed only obliquely) for political reasons while seven men were hanged for war crimes.A good read with some photos."
2,Missing items,I purchased this product based on the description that it included an armband and a neck strap. Neither of these were in the package (a new product). This is very disappointing and inconvienant.
1,Just OK,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found the text boring and the photos uninteresting. And I read a lot of books like this. ""Nuff said."
1,A scholar of Mexican art says AVOID THIS BOOK,"...it isn't just that the crime photos it republishes are problematic, but the book has NO INTELLECTUAL WEIGHT and in fact, uses the essays by Medina and Fox (commissioned for another publication, edited and republished without their consent) to ""validate"" the author's egocentric/gringocentric visions. The TITLE IS TOTALLY MISLEADING and the text offers no ideas that are worth remembering. The first book I ever wanted to really really trash."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"This poorly written, self-published book is nothing but a pathetic attempt to generate business for the author's consulting firm, which she hawks in every chapter. She continually alludes to information that is never provided, although she eventually offers to sell the information for an additional fee. Her self-promotion is interspersed with incessant whining about Ohio's ""evil"" building inspectors, whose only real fault was that they had the audacity to actually enforce the building codes in her state. There is litle information of real value in this book and it will quickly be apparent why it was self-published."
2,How to Start Your Own Tea Room...by Whitaker,"This book gives a fair overview of the details involved in opening a restaurant and gift shop, though it appears her main purpose is to get the reader to sign up for her consulting service. The book is not well written and you have to wonder about a tea room owner who misspells Earl Grey tea as ""Earl Gray""! However, a reader with absolutely no background in opening a business will find that this book offers some good basic information and will cause you to consider whether opening such a business is really right for you to do."
5,Just my cup of tea!,"If you are serious about starting a tea business, look no further. This book gives you ALL the details, start to finish. It is one of the most comprehensive books I have ever read. It was so insightful that I realized I was in over my head!! I recommend it for anyone considering a business like this."
3,"Movie is good, but has a few plot flaws.","I remember when this movie would be on the FOX network all the time during the eighties. Usually it was the Saturday afternoon movie. I thought that this movie was alright but had a few plot flaws. First, it is clearly stated in the movie title that this is the year 3000. Thats more than a 1000 years from now, yet people are driving vehicles from the sixties and seventies including an old Ford Torino and a 1970 Chevy pickup? Where is everybody getting the fuel for these vehicles? Also the boy who escapes from the convoy of vehicles looking for water after it is attacked has a super bionic arm. There is no other evidence of this ""super technology"" anywhere. Just evidence that this movie had a low budget, was made in the early eighties, and was made either in Italy or just by Italians. You can tell because the movie is dubbed and most of the names are Italian. But overall this flick is alright for a ""movie for a rained out baseball game"" kind of afternoon."
2,The stunts are good!,"Mad Max is the inspiration for this film as the characters drive around in souped up cars with extra bits stuck on them. It's no worse or better than other films of it's genre and there are some exciting moments. The stunts are good, but you'd have to be prepared to sit through dubbed dialogue, so-so acting and dull music. One for the collectors."
2,It looks good on your book case,"I've heard about this book for many years. Many people in the strength community gave it praise. It was hard to find do to it being out of print. I finally got a copy and I am disappointed. It is all just RANT, RANT, RANT, I stopped reading it. It was just babble. It was like a motivational speaker with a 6th grade education. LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD! What does that mean? No technique explanation. No routines. No examples. No anatomy or bio-physics explained. The only redeeming value is he introduces odd-object lifting i.e atlas stones, kegs, huge rocks which is actually helpful and functional, but he doesn't explain why it works or how to make your own. This book is like MEIN KAMPF for weightlifters. I would suggest 'Power to the People' if you want to get strong. I was hoping this book would help me transition from powerlifting to strongman competitions, but I will look somewhere else. I wouldn't even suggest this book for general fitness."
3,"Adequate, but that's all","Mr. Gambale seems kind and unpretentious, but I found this DVD unexciting. It's divided into two halves: a concert with his trio, and a set of about twenty improvisation exercises. I found his compositions rather dull, perhaps because all his melodies are unending strings of eighth notes. And the improvisation exercises were rudimentary to anyone who knows a bit of jazz, while at the same time they might be hard to understand for anyone who doesn't.Personally, I'm really digging the Jody Fisher jazz guitar method books right now, and would recommend those to people curious about jazz improvisation. The first in the series is this one, I think:Beginning Jazz Guitar (Book & DVD)"
3,Limited but useful in it's area,"This book is much better at talking about anime fan culture than anime itself. If you're interested in knowing more about the films, there are better resources such as ""Anime Explosion"", ""Samurai from Outer Space"" or, for the more academically inclined, ""Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke"""
1,Uhm..,"Just by reading the description, the author has no idea what an otaku really is. It's not a positive thing. Many Japanese words are misconstrued in America. I really hope whoever reads this..doesn't go around native Japanese screaming how wonderful it is to now be an otaku because they bought this book."
3,Can be overwhelming,"A good resource, though I found the information overwhelming. Also in some cases not complete. I think this book in conjnction with the county extension office and your vet is the best."
3,Bold and feminine,"I love the look and style of it. I own the white version, and am happy I did not go for the turquoise version. It is very much a watch that surely gets noticed, and that is what I wanted. And I am happy that responses are very positive. I admit that a person needs to have guts to wear it.Muscle too, because it is on the heavy side, hence the name TANK? The claps make it easy to adjust to my wrist size, and the bangle chain came in handy!And sometimes the clasps do unlock themselves easily. Moreover, two pins holding the clasps together came out whilst wearing so I nearly lost my watch were it not for the safety chain. It has been fine now for some time, but I tend to watch my watch more often nowadays. All in all, 3 stars."
1,Don't waist you money,Hunter's Specialties Scent-A-Way Odorless Powder Does not work to keep you dry it actually made me sweat more then I would with out it. I use scent a way for everything but this is one product I will never buy again
1,Beware NOT PADEREWSKI edition! False advertising.,"Beware!!! This is not the Paderewski edition, I just received this book. I heard Dover no long print the Chopin Paderewski edition. The new book will not be the Paderewski edition. It is a big difference, look carefully at the book, the cover does not indicate Paderewski. Don't be mislead by the false title description of this product."
1,This is NOT Paderewski edition,"Don't waste money thinking this is Paderewski edition.If this can be any edition, can be a good deal, but if you need Paderewski edition, this is not. I am not sure amazon understand the difference."
4,Great pieces in an easy to read format,"Everything about this edition is great. It's easy to read, etc.The only negative thing I would say about this is that sometimes the editing gets a little cumbersome (fingering and pedaling recommendations). And it is never addressed whether the markings are one's the composer wrote, or if they are mere suggestions.Overall, it's great, though!"
2,"Poor quality and pirated. Avoid, avoid, avoid!","This is not an official release. For whatever reasons the 8-volume Betty Boop - The Definitive Collection [VHS] released 11 years ago on VHS & Laserdisc formats, the (so far) ultimate and remastered collection, remains unreleased by the copyright holder, Republic Pictures Home Video. The manufacturer of this set probably (and erroneously) believes these cartoons are in the public domain, and dumps second-rate product like this on an unknowledgable public. Well, now you're knowledgable. These are poor pirated copies. Avoid them, or be disappointed. We can hope that soon our beloved Betty will get the attention and production values that the recent 3-volume Fleischer ""Popeye"" DVD sets got last year.Do yourself a favor-- buy the video box set, and if you really *must* have them on DVD transfer them to DVD yourself, most new computers with a DVD burner can do this with a minimum of fuss and effort."
5,not eligible to reeview,I do not feel eligible to review either of these Betty Boop Collectionsbecause for some unknown reason neither did not operate on the DVD players we have. I did not return it because I absolutely love Amazon.com and do not hold hold Amazon responsible so I just gave them to a professor friend who probably had a better DVD player and some historical interest in the merchandise
4,Enjoyable Yaoi title!,"Play Boy Blues is fast paced and entertaining, though the story does leave one wanting, in terms of deeper character and plot development. Still the mangaka's artwork is pleasing, with her boys, both tops and bottoms, long limbed and muscularly slim. However the publishing quality does lag behind that of dramaqueen and Blu, just compare the paper quality, including the cover, and the printing. Another annoying factor is the confusion in the dialogue. Lots of time I could not link the thoughts or dialogue to the right person and this is expecially annoying when the boys are expressing their feelings towards one another. Still, I am please to add this to my Yaoi collection."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I have read a lot of Yaoi and, I admit, some of it I bought just for the naughty bits and I didn't care if it had a decent plot. This one fooled me! It led me to believe it had a real plot (it was disjointed and weak) and great naughty bits (denied again!). Plus, at first glance, the illustrations reminded me of Youka Nitta's style (not so much after I really looked at it...so disappointing...).This (along with ""Golden Cain"" and ""Gakuen Heaven"") is the worst Yaoi I have purchased.Don't waste your time or your money on this stinker!"
4,This is very well written,"The prologue made think, hmmmm, is this going to be corny (by just a few paragraphs). Then the first chapter got me hooked. It is very well written with great depth to the characters.I really liked the small twists of surprises. Kit was a woman that was very interesting and believable for a historical romance. Meaning she had spunk but was not an irritating heroine which many romance writers do regularily and a reader is sure that the heroine has 20th century tendancies.The support characters were very good. Cade was a good ""little brother"" learning the ropes of life. The reader felt the pain that Hawk was experiencing. I liked how he treated his sister. They had a great relationship."
2,Boring and not well written,I did not like this book at all. It was really boring and not that imaginative. The typical over bearing fater and the headstrong young girl who defies her father to find her brother......Don't waste your time or money.
4,Great!,Branded hearts was an excellent book and I think you should go out and buy it or rent it at your local library.
2,Real Wheels,"When I was searching for Tractor Tom DVD's, this 'Real Wheels' series was suggested as a similar DVD line, however, I find it really boring to watch and it's not what I was looking for at all..... So, I'm a bit disappointed that I purchased it based on the Amazon's sale suggestion.I will certainly be a little more careful about acting on any further product suggestions."
5,Great Tractor Movie!!,We bought this movie for our sons. They love love this movie.It is really a neat movie about tractors and how they work.
3,Loves Tractors,"My little boy loves tractors, so we thought we'd purchase this video for his 3rd birthday. After watching it, I guess I can say it's ""okay"". Dave, the main character who gets to experience all of the tractor and farm happenings, is a little cheesy. My son didn't really laugh during the ""funny"" parts. However, the tractors and trucks that are shown are enough to keep his attention. John Deere has a great line of videos that I would recommend over this one."
2,Just okay - not as good as Rockin' Wheels,"I was purchasing Rockin' Wheels (the one with the train and fire truck) for my son, and the Truck Adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together. We borrowed the Rockin' Wheels DVD from the library and he liked it so much, I thought it would be good to have two different ones. However, the Truck Adventures is not as good, and my son doesn't even ask to watch it. The songs are lame and so is the narrator. Don't bother."
5,This book is GREAT!,"I teach a digital photography class! This is the book I'm going to use. It explains in great detail about digital photography, scanning, and imaging using Adobe Photodeluxe. The price of the book is worth the FREE Adobe Photodeluxe. I am also a web designer and I actually use Photodeluxe to manipulate some photos I use on my websites! This book is a must if you're interested in digital cameras, scanning, or imaging!"
4,Nice snug fit,"I'm 5'9"", 150 pounds, balanced proportions, and I had no problems with the fit. I was actually really impressed with the quality and elasticity...and I wore this into the ground last winter. It was a little short for my arms, but most long-sleeves are. The only thing that bothered me was as it became used, it developed those little tiny fabric balls on the outside, which tend to develop on sweaters and woven items. Other than that, highly recommended."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased 2 sets of these playground balls in the fall. Three months later, they are all flat and several of them have cuts. They have received minimum use and have been stored on a playground cart and used on grass. I think they should have lasted longer than this."
4,Perfect for dodge ball,"These are the perfect size for dodgeball. 5 of 6 held the air, only one seeps and needs to be refilled every few days."
4,Awesome.,"If there was one item on the playground when i was a child that i loved, it was the kickball. Getting this set for my kids (and giving a couple away, and a few to the church) was a great idea. the bonus of different colors made it worth it to split it all up. Make sure you get a needle to air them up though, they tend to lose a bit of air if in the sun to long."
2,not very well made,"these balls arent very good quality, i ordered a dozen, one had a hole in it, another i accidentally punctured while trying to inflate it,(the rubber is too thin in my opinion) the balls themselves werent spherical, almost all were slightly misshapen, ive bought cheaper balls elsewhere that were much better quality."
3,Not a Good Deal,"The book took a very long time to arrive.It was in the condition as described in the add.However,based on the fact that I later found the same book in Hardback(First Edition)inscribed by the author to a relative for $30.00 shipping included the paperback edition was way over priced!!!"
1,Pseudo-intellectual balderdash,"I will not elevate this book to the status of a legitimate work of intellectual inquiry by writing a detailed critique of it. Suffice it to say that the author, rather than citing objective evidence in support of her conclusions, does nothing except make baldly conclusory statements which conform to her ultra-feminist world view. If Ms. Adams wishes to be a vegetarian feminist, that's her business. But until she can come up with objective evidence that her hypothesis is true, she comes across as nothing but a rambling mad-woman. Using the conclusory technique employed by Ms. Adams, I could easily write an equally legitimate book claiming that vegetarianism causes oppression of men worldwide. Any publishers out there interested?"
5,best,Incredible! Stoked on reading something that shares my exact views. definitely a must read for anarcho vegan feminists. Definitely challenges the status quo.
4,Read this book,"Everyone should read, but this book will blow your mind and give you quite a different perspective on things that should be talked about more often."
3,Good basic raw food recipe book,I enjoyed this book and have been making some of the recipes. It will definitely stay in my good book collection.
4,A Great Place to Start,"This book was a great help as I started out on my raw adventures. It contains a number of easy to follow recipes which have become staples in my diet. My only problem with this book is that the table of contents is not intuitive making it hard to refer back to recipes. You need to remember that the name of that Kale dish you like is ""Disappearing Kale"" and won't be found in the index under K but D. If the author does a second edition PLEASE make finding recipes easier! Thanks. Note: This book has no pictures (for that try The Raw Gourmet by Nomi Shannon which is excellent). You should also be aware that many of the recipes call for the use of a food dehydrator which is a great machine but not cheap."
5,Taking eating and health to a whole new level!,"Gabrielle Chavez's book, The Raw Gourmet, brings a new dimension to the subject of raw cuisine!The information is direct, well researched, and presented in a fashion that is appealing to those new to the concept of ""Going Raw"" as well as to those who have already had the pleasure of indulging in Raw Delights!Her recipes lead to a delicious discovery of taste and texture, without guilt or guile!A great gift that anyone regardless of eating choices and cooking styles can and will enjoy!"
4,"Raw food gourmet - great informaion, easy recipes",This is my first raw food cook book and I have to say that I am impressed by the recipes. I have just visited a completely raw food restaurant in New York which inspired me to prepare food in its raw state - this book has given me inspiration and direction to do just this!
3,Question,"Hi, i want to know if it is possible ship (sent) it to venezuela?? and if it come with the Switch control and all the stuff for conecting direct to the car??? it's a pair of light or only one light?"
3,Strange production values,"I have only had the DVD for two days and watched the first time to see how the work out will be. It looks like it will meet expectations, but there is a huge distraction -- every once in a while, the screen has a goulish green cast to it, and I don't know if this is done on purpose or if there is a defect with the DVD. I tried going to the website to see if I could get some insight, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get in touch with them via email. Is everyone having this green screen experience? Or is my DVD defective?"
5,Love it!,"Fowler's technique is awesome, especially for beginners. I love incorporating yoga into my weekly routine, the perfect compliment to cardio! While the ""green screen"" can be a bit odd, the video works wonders!"
4,Good overall workout for athletes,"I use this DVD quite a bit. I like the workout. The poses/vinyasas she uses are pretty basic, but incorporate stretching and strengthening. It is a complete yoga session. I have one complaint, tho. What is up with the green color that comes over the screen every time the camera focuses on the instructor? I guess it is meant to be hip and edgy, but is mainly annoying and distracting.Overall, I do recommend this workout. The instruction is precise and accurate. It is a good addition to a training regimen."
1,Insulting to an ancient and revered tradition,"I am extremely offended by the blurbs used on the cover of this DVD: ""No chanting. No granola. No sanskrit."" I consider them to be racial slurs that are disrespectful to the history of yoga and its rich cultural tradition. If someone wants to produce a practice DVD that strips the substance from the form because they think will successfully reach a market niche, the least they could do is come up with a way to advertise their product that is more respectful to the meaningful content they stripped out. I'm returning this DVD without opening it."
4,night owl,The night vision monocular works very well and as advertised. The ad idicated it used AA bateries when indeed it does require a lithium-ion pricey battery.
3,"see in the dark, zoom is bad","just got it today, tried it, and it wasn't what I expected. was able to see things in a completely dark room, but the zoom function was not good at all. this monocular is functioning more like a sunglasses that you can see thing in the dark."
5,Vey Cool,"This is a great documentary. After you've seen it the first time, be sure to watch it again with James St. James's super-catty comentary. For example, when Angel's brother Johnny starts to weep for Angel, James comments,""Johnny, what is that HAIR?!"". Mee-OOOOOOOW!!!!"
3,club drag,"There was hardly anything tragic about this party life documentary. Some kids with style and balls invigorate a dying Manhattan social scene. Drugs are involved and oftentimes take over much of the party. So what's new? This can get really boring to watch. I enjoyed this documentary only because I knew half of the people in it, but otherwise I'd imagine that it's like watching a graduation video of someone else's high school graduation. Could be cute in a voyeuristic sense, but nothing dynamic. So one of these party hounds got out of control and killed someone. The only thing that sets this apart from the many similar incidents that go on like this on a daily, is that the murderer was well liked and the victim was not. This leads one to ponder how we as a society function when it comes to fairness. An entertaining romp through clubland, but please don't give it more credit than is necessary."
2,A warning from the past,"What can I say? Shame, shame on anyone who ever gave these children any money, time or attention for this nonsense! What kind of parents, what kind of adults, would look the other way as these pathetic urchins self-destructed? Is there really an art to this nasty creation? Or are we simply celebrating our own demise? Don't waste one more minute on this crass collection of what passes for drama. It's sad and pathetic, and a warning from the past.When I think of the people who were struggling with poverty in those years for no other reason than they were trying to live a clean and sober life and raise their children safely. I guess this puts the lie to all that, eh? Obeying the law and going to work every day and paying your bills is obviously for suckers.At least I'm still alive, and so are my children. We're not wealthy - but I guess our riches speak volumes.Holiday HeartDark Days"
3,muffler tips,The muffler tips provided with this product did not fit with the clamps provided as they were too big. So i had to have them welded on instead which was an extra added expense.
3,"Decent sound, but...","Installation was a breeze, once the old part was removed. I gave this a 3 star because the exhaust tips didn't fit on the mufflers! This came as a kit, but the clamps on the tips, no matter how much I tightened them, wouldn't clamp down on the pipe. The tips would still just slip off. I tightened one of the bolts with a breaker bar and snapped the bolt. I'm guessing that I received the wrong size, but didn't realize this until the entire system was installed. All other fittings fit perfectly.Just some advice, check your tips for fit prior to installation!"
5,It is the best CLSC book on the market. Two thumbs UP!,"I passed the CLSC exam using this book as my primary study guide. It had no errors that I found, and the review questions were close to the real exam. I recommend this book."
5,This book did it for me also!,"I passed the exam using only this book and a 1900 switch, which I borrowed from work. I studied the Cat 5000 section hard, and went through all the review questions 3 times. Read and pass! This is the best CLSC book on the market!"
5,The best CLSC book on the market.,"I checked out Cisco and Exam Cram, the Exam Cram is the worst book of the lot. The Sybex book is by far the best CLSC book on the market. I recommend it highly."
3,Good but does not cover for the new CLSC exam - Beta,"I did like the CCNA book by Todd, but this book does not cover the new CLSC exam which is in Beta I was not very happy with this book. But it gives a good insight into switching tech... Thanks Todd."
4,This Book Did it for me,"I recently took this exam. It covered almost everything on the exam. The only thing that I wish it would have divulged into further is CLI's. I got several questions on the exam, which I luckily learned from working with the 5509's. I don't think I like all the new software that seems to be taking place of a lot of CLI users. The book is a pretty good reference.Stephen Sims CCNP"
3,Adequate for passing the exam,"I passed the exam last week using this book primarily to study....however, I also have attended the actual course and have experience working with many of the switch families. I would recommend this book only in conjuction with the CLSC exam certification guide by cisco press....should one use only this book to prepare for the test, they may only pass with a score in the low 800s (if it is important to you not just to pass the test but achieve a high score) and certainly not come away with much valued knowledge to apply to the field. Personally, I will be using only Cisco press books from now on in my quest for CCNP."
3,It's no Cisco book,"I'd wait for the CLSC Exam Certification Guide from Cisco. This book is ok, but Cisco's books tend to be organized and written better."
4,Good Book,"Although it is used for CCNP 1.0 exam, I think it is a good book anyway. It can give you a good explanation on the VLAN, especially the explanation on the product. You can get much information on Catalyst 5000/5500 series, 3000 series etc. That is the main point you should buy it."
5,"Great information, especially on ATM","This book has an awesome ATM section. The price of the book is worth that chapter alone. Although Sybex has an updated switching book out, this book has some seriously great information."
2,"eloquent, but ho-hum","In today's overspent consumer society, we need persuasive voices to promote thinking and discourse about consumption and values, and to rally us to change. Juliet Schor has such a voice, and I'm glad she's using it. And yet ... I have to say I didn't get much out of this book. It's a predictable diatribe against high consumption that dwells too much on SUV-driving residents of McMansions and overemphasizes a romanticized 1950s-style family/neighborhood life as the alternative vision. Can we really end the consumerist era by turning back the hands of time and restoring puritanical values? Would we even want to? To imagine a post-consumerist future, we need ideas more original and forward-looking than are found in this book."
3,"editors made her tack on the dippy ""suggestions"" end section","Schorr is a fine writer with a good idea, but the lightweight and naive solutions she suggests to solve our overspending are clearly New York editor-think. Like a disjointed movie written by a committee that provides an inappropriate happy ending, Schorr's many editors (she bemoans losing the one who acquired her manuscript) wouldn't let her research speak for itself. Her suggestion that Americans share their riding lawnmowers is perhaps the single dumbest thing I've ever read in a serious book; she must have passively-aggressively written the concluding chapters under duress. Unless they're padding. This is a mighty short book as it is."
5,Enlightening,"I knew there was something wrong with society, but it took this book to help me identify what intensified this mad race for the almighty thing. I appreciated that she was able to include scientific data without interrupting the follow of the book. I also liked the voice in this book better then some of the down shifting memoirs I was looking at at the time. It was a great combo of readability and scientific backing."
2,Reads like a boring psychology book.,I am disappointed that Juliet Schor insulted many of her readers by using the out of date reference to women as housewives throughout her book. I would have appreciated more information about saving and investing and the rewards that come from doing so.
3,"Good points, too academic and dry","After 30 minutes....of reading a great deal of it, I felt unsatisfied...its approach was too academic; the bulk of the book was used to establish the fact that Americans 'overspend'....obvious to those of us who just observe daily life...What would have been more compelling is HOW people are addressing this distressing fact of life today...there were some anecdotes, but clearly more alternatives could have been discussed...maybe this is the next book for the author??? Although much 'research' was revealed, as a consumer I felt it was a 'missed opportunity' for the author as well as for the public...someone ought to retackle this..."
2,Didn't leave an impact,"I didn't feel like a learned a whole lot from this book. There were a lot of criticisms, but few solutions that people could actually put into use. On a side note, I was very annoyed by how Schor kept referring to air conditioning as a ""luxury item."" No one would refer to heating fuel as a luxury."
4,Almost Enough Information,"Sometimes we need the obvious slapped across our face. The Overspent American is just that. It helps people understand the problem of living a life based on what you'd like to have and having it right now.I've just finished another money book that takes the next step. After you've been slapped into reality, pick up a copy of ""THE CREDIT DIET - How To Shed Unwanted Debt and Achieve Fiscal Fitness."" This book shows you ""HOW TO"" change the way you think about money and spending. But it also helps you set up a solid financial foundation so that you can have what you want, quicker than you thought, adn without increasing your debts."
1,Disappointed..thank goodness for the library,"Let's be frank: what this book describes is a real problem in America--rampant consumerism. However, after this point is beaten like the dead horse it is, the author degrades into slamming ""polluting, congestion-oriented, etc."" sport-utility vehicles and encouraging us to join some ""downshifting"" clubs. These clubs sound suspiciously like hippie communes. I should have expected more from a professor. But the rants go on and on, so my interest dwindled. Also, don't be fooled about the page count; almost 1/3 of the pages are references.If you want a good book about consumer habits, read ""The millionare next door."""
1,Utterly trite,"Wow, a book that tells us that people spend money on things they don't need because it's cool. Do not waste your money on this [junk]. It's not even cool."
5,"Great book, many people could use this reality check!","A real wake up call to how many of us live everyday! Lots of interesting statistics, and very matter of fact. Many real-life stories, but not enough advice on step-by-step ways to get out of this destructive pattern of living. Also, I found it really funny that several times the author mentions ""Car with Air Conditioner"" as a luxury! To many people, this is obviously NOT a luxury..."
4,Engaging and Informative,"Juliet Schor provides Americans, in this engaging book, the knowledge of what their overspending can and probably is costing themselves, their families and their community. The data and research allow readers to look at themselves and what they consume to determine who they are and how they can make their lives happier. Schor's pioneering ideas that consumption can make people less happy need to be looked at by many families in America, so that they may be more conscious of advertising and television. Debt in America is becoming a problem, and this book promotes a higher rate of savings by families and spending less for their well-being and happiness."
3,Good basic dermatopathology book.,This is a good basic pathology book with good black and white photos. The strength of this book is that all of the features are illustrated with pointers to the significant feature. The drawbacks are that the photomicrographs are not in color and the text is not all encompassing. Some of the newer immunohistochemical staining techniques are not fully explained.
2,Brush Off This Toothbrush,"After me admonishing my tot at least 854 times to not bite her toothbrush, and her ignoring me, this is the one that kicked the bucket in less that one month of ownership. She pulled a loose bristle out of her mouth, and I was worried. When I examined the brush, there was a tiny thin metal/foil (?) square resting within the other bristles. Its dimensions were larger than a piece of glitter; I pulled on other bristles to find out exactly how this toothbrush is made, but to no avail. Wimps like me cannot answer the burning question as to how this toothbrush is produced, but I can at least tell ya to use this one to clean grout instead."
1,Don't bother,This book was required reading for my MBA program - don't bother with the book. It is just another way for your professors to make money and to support their colleagues in the field.
1,Missleading Title,"I respectfully disagree with the other evaluations of the book, it is a long rant; yes, a tirade. The book is the author's personal reflections on society, that anyone who is schooled in the christian faith can figure out themselves. The title suggests that the reader will find the book to be a resource a place of suggestions to practice christian life, however, that is not what the book is. Each chapter is basically a critical essay, and leaves the reader more dispondent about the direction of the universal christian church and how christian life fits into the larger society. The last chapters refer to eastern religions and yet on the cover it says, ""genuine christianity for the m iddle class"". Don't waste your money."
1,"Breaks easily, not worth it","I bought one of these at REI, went home, and poured in peppercorns to try it out. After about 3 turns the little plastic piece holding the spring and gears down snapped. I exchanged it for a new one the next morning, took it home, proceeded to do the same as before, and once again the small plastic piece snapped. This is obviously not built strong enough to actually handle grinding pepper, which kind of defeats the purpose of the mill all together."
5,A GREAT BOOK!!!!!,This book is really a great book. I couldn't stop reading it. This is a good book because it tells you what its like for a divorced parent to get married again. It tells about the struggles and the ups and downs of a parent getting remarried. I liked this book because it was very well written
5,Very Good Book,"I am only 14 years old and I didn't think I would like this book. After I read about the 3rd chapter, I was immediatly hooked. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole thing. I couldn't put it down. Plus, if you like unexpected endings, you will definatly love it."
1,the Next Accident,"The Next Accident was fantastic, looking forward to the next in the series. Way to go Lisa Gardner your books are great."
4,The Next Accident,"The book was very interesting, and very intriguing to say, kept me in suspense at all time. Cinstantly trying to figure who the actual person who was doing the killings but was very suprise to find out who it actually was sure that it was Momgery that did it."
3,The Next Accident,I found the story interesting and it kept me wanting to know what would happen in the next chapter.With each accident you had to try to align it with that what had happened prior and why.Quick read.
3,Not Bad,"I think this book got better as it went on, but I think it dragged a little. I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of book, but it seemed to lack something I can't name."
4,Lisa Gardner never disappoints,The Quincy / Raine books are spell-binding. I can't seem to put them down and I never know until nearly the end of the book who the 'bad guy' really is. Gardner does a great job keep that under wraps and surprising you with a twist that leaves you stunned. Well written...fast-paced.
1,Tiny Asian Asses,"Very poor quality. Looks like it was shot with a cell phone. Only played for 30 min before it stopped. Worst dvd I ever bought, just random blury shots taken in a dark night club, walking down a street and through a mall. Nothing I've never seen anything before as bad as this dvd. I'm requesting a refund!"
3,Works for now...,"The first sharpener I got didn't work but amazons exchange process was pretty easy and quick. I believe I had a new sharpener within 2 days (i have amazon prime). I'm a industrial design student so I go through at minimum 2 pencils a week. They gotta be sharp so I got tried of manually sharpening and figured i try this. For sharpening regular #2 pencils this should be fine. However, I'm sharpening prismacolor pencils, verithins, and various leads. It isn't perfect in those regards. Prismacolor pencils almost consistently break every 3rd or 4th sharpen. Meaning i have to open it over a garbage can and shake or pry free the stuck piece. Definitely gets frustrating also occasionally it will just randomly start running after setting it down or picking it up. It gets the job done, barely. Theres probably a better sharpener out there but this one is justified by its low price"
1,didn't work,it didn't work. packaging was accidently thrown away and it would have cost too much to return. Just counted it as a loss since it didn't cost all that much
1,Waste of time and money,I just threw this out after trying once again to get this thing to sharpen a pencil. This never really worked properly and I got much better points on pencils with an old fashioned sharpener. After a few unsatisfactory uses it pretty much stopped working all together.
1,Real Waste Of Money,"Terrible product. Worked great the first couple times, but then started slowing down. Replaced batteries three times within couple months and only sharpened pencil maybe once a week if that often. I have had several pencil sharpeners over the years, and never had one go bad this quick."
1,You get what you paid for...,"I bought this pencil sharpener for my kindergarten son. I thought it's small, battery-operated, safer than the tiny manual pencil sharpener, and cheap enough if he breaks it quickly. However, my son came to me and said it's not working. I tried it myself and I realized I get what I paid for. The inside of this pencil sharpener is just like those tiny manual pencil sharpener. It's plastic with a tiny piece of blade screwed onto it. When you put the pencil in, it won't stop when the pencil is sharpened. It'll keep sharpening and breaking the lead. I never know when to pull the pencil out when sharpening. The pencil is either not sharpened yet or the lead has been broken and stuck inside. I'll have to open the tray and empty it before I can remove the broken lead that's stuck inside. I think this is a terrible product. I rather use the manual pencil sharpener than this one."
1,Simply does not work,Don't waste your money. Thins cheaply made sharpener has eaten every pencil I've tried to sharpen. I've finally thrown it away because I don't think it worth the hassle of returning.
1,STAY CLEAR OF THIS PENCIL SHARPENER,The batteries make you want to through it against the wall they will not say in place while putting in the next batteryThis pencil sharpener will not sharpen a new pencil once you get the batteries in.I recommend buy a good electric pencil sharpener
5,Great and simple for kids and for the price!!,"Great for the price, especially for kids. You have to twist the pencil a bit wehen you put it in. No biggie"
4,works great!,This sharpener works great! The price is excellent! Sharpens pencils to a fine point. Seems well made but the lid to the battery compartment is a little touchy. It did not want to go back on after the batteries were put in but it finally went on and seems solid.
2,Buyer beware,"I was hoping I would be one of the ones who actually like this sharpener, but I'm not. I received this and put new batteries in it and promptly broke the lead of the first pencil I put in there. My new batteries act like they're about to die as the sharpener struggles to sharpen each pencil, and it breaks about half the leads. Too bad. Why do sharpeners have to be so expensive? I gave it two stars because the pencils it does sharpen are done quickly and have a nice point."
2,TERRIBLE,"The low price might be tempting but believe me, it's not worth it. I used this on a box of brand new Prismacolors and you can see by the pictures I uploaded what it did to them. Maybe this would be good for a little kid's pencils or sharpening pencils at school or office but for nice pencils, you will be sorry you tried it."
1,Do not buy!,After a month or so this sharpener stopped turning when pencil inserted. Sometimes it would turn after several tries but it was frustrating to the point that I through the piece of junk in the garbage. It is so cheap for a reason.
1,Junk,"Thought it would be decent enough but it is really junk. Does not sharpen at all, spins round and round without doing a thing."
1,Sharpened 2 pencils before it broke,"Title says it all, sharpened 2 pencils before it broke. Very shoddy product. I was trying to find a cheaper alternative for a powered pencil sharpener. This was a piece of garbage, don't waste your money. Amazon didn't even want me the defective product back, they just refunded my money."
2,Almost unusable,"I bought this because of the price and wasn't too concerned about the negative reviews since I was only planning to use it for my daughter's (2nd grade) homework pencils. That said, I've pretty much given up on it. As other reviewers have said, it's only got one blade, so it's basically like having a battery spin a standard little hand-held sharpener. I've found that either it just won't spin at all due to a lack of power or when you can finally get it to run, it ends up breaking the lead before it gets really sharp. I suppose that could be as much the pencils as the sharpener, but I don't really have the same issue sharpening by hand. So, into the drawer it goes and the search continues."
5,excellent product for the price,"Not particularly high tech, but works great. Have to hold the base firmly when sharpening, but it makes a nice point without taking too much off. Compact and portable."
1,Disappointing.,This pencil sharpener was quite a disappointment. I bought it about 2 months ago. It eats the pencils without sharpening correctly. It shouldn't take longer to get your pencil sharpened than it does to do your homework. Bought a different brand today that seems to work much better.
2,Not That Good,"Sometimes it works perfectly. Therefore I did not give 1 star. I bought it a couple of years ago and there are major issues with it breaking the point. That would not even be so bad but you need to spend minutes trying to get the broken lead out of the blade, otherwise it will continually break leads on every pencil you try.This is especially true with softer lead pencils like colored pencils and maybe even certain types of wood, especially round with thick paint, like those kids get for gifts/prices at school."
1,Doesn't work!,I put new batteries in this and it really doesn't sharpen pencils. Not enough juice to get job done. What a waste.
4,nice for the price,"this pencil sharpener does exactly what it's supposed to do. and with its price, it's unbeatable. the manufacturer surely made its construction simple. the only thing i can complain about is its battery compartment. it's a bit too tight especially when closing the lid. i was afraid i might break it as the batteries were popping out. but overall, it's a good product. simple and cheap."
1,Worthless,"If I hadn't already pitched this, it would have been a great produuct for a video review.Doesn't sharpen all sides of the pencil evenly. Sometimes it seemed the leads must have cracked from the torquing because they would fall out if you did get the pencil sharpened to a point.Dangerous too. Sometimes the painted shavings would come off in a spiral and wind around the sharpening mechanism. Just removing the plastic cover doesn't turn off the motor. Take out the batteries! Sometimes when trying to untangle the sharpening mechanism it would come on and spin a fewtimes even without a pencil in it.Wasted money to buy the sharpener and wasted money replacing the ruined pencils."
1,X-acto/Elmers. Not so good,"Ok here's the deal... This worked with the first set of batteries, but the subsequent purchases proved to be futile since, no matter which battery I purchased, nothing worked.The sharpener was less than $10. The batteries have cost me almost $18, and, as I mentioned, it only worked with the first set, about 5 days, and now no longer works.They sent me a second, which worked not at all (it was missing the metal lead).It cost me nothing to get it replaced. but...Buy electric, that is what I finally did and it works great.As for X-acto, buy their products. They stand behind them and have GREAT costumer service.Dianne Schuch Lindsey dlschuch at Salon.com (Open Salon)"
3,Battery Operated,Just what I wanted a battery operated pencil sharpener. Not as sturdy as some but it does do the job that I wanted.
4,Strong motor and mechanic but the blade is dull after three months,"This sharpener is strong but I needed to change the blade afterthree months of use. I took a blade from a manual sharpenerto replace the used one, they just happened to have the same size."
2,Buy something else,I bought this item due to the price and other reviews. The exacto pencil sharpener is difficult to assemble and work. It tends to grab the pencil so you need to use great effort to sharpen. It works but barely. Buy something else!
1,Died Fast,I had a similar battery operated pencil sharpener before I bought this one. That lasted about 10 years. This one lasted about 3 months. Dead. Can't get the blades to turn at all. It doesn't look like there's anything jammed in there. In the garbage. Ugg.
1,"while it does work, i had to wrap a rubber band around it to keep the battery cover from falling off","poorly made and designed but at least it wasn't expensive. while it does work, i had to wrap a rubber band around it to keep the battery cover from falling off"
1,X-acto 16750,"Completly waste of money, it did not work even 2 months, the batteries get rusty, awfull, do not buy it"
1,broke as soon as it was used,Terrible Item. It broke as soon as I used it. Awful would definitely recommend not purchasing it.No other way to explain it. Do not buy it.
1,bad quality,"just after two months purchase, this one stopped working, the middle part made by plastic was broken. very low quality"
1,dont even bother,I purchased this pencil sharperner for my colored pencils and it jams all the time and doesnt stay in place on the table when i put the pencil in.
4,Simple and works well,"At this price, you wont find a fancy sharpening gear inside. Just a simple blade sharpener that rotates itself when you insert a pencil. Despite this, it works well. Hold the pencil firmly and press down gently. It's surprisingly powerful and makes quick work of sharpening an entire box of pencils. It's not designed for crayons or fat pencils, but for the price I'm more than satisfied. When I reach for a pencil, it's ready to go."
1,Ugh. Chucked It.,"This thing was a disaster, and I gave it a chance. Really, I did. A few years.... It simply chews up pencils. Just when you think it's almost sharp, snap! Broken lead, and somehow, it breaks the lead way down the shaft so you have to chew off another inch or two before you finally get something resembling a sharp pencil. So frustrating!Oh, and don't even get me started on what happens to those broken leads! You have to take off the shaving-catcher/cover thing and get something like a toothpick to dislodge it while the darn blade keeps moving..... Arrrggghh! Then, when you try to put the cover back on, it feels as though it's going to break, (though in all fairness, it never did).In. The. Trash. Can. Sharpened all 24 required pencils for my son's school by hand, thank you very much."
2,not the best sharpener,"Even though the sharpener is compact and battery operated (which is a plus, no plugs) it doesn't sharpen art pencils very well. There is also not much room for the pencil shavings... 2-3 pencils and its full and it's not easy to clean. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Terrible,This has a rotating blade that will break off the coloring part of the pencil any time after it has gone dull. The blade will get dull in no time. I am very disappointed with this product. It just doesn't last. I will never buy a rotating blade anymore. Not even a manual one.
3,OK for home use,It works ok but light duty. I use it on pencils used for crossword puzzles. Wouldn't recommend it for office use but who uses pencils any more anyway?
1,pencil tips break off,"I purchased this more than 5 years ago, and ever since then I dread every time I need a pencil sharpened. Everytime I use this sharpener, it breaks the tip off the end of my pencil, and then the tip is lodged in a place that prevents the pencil from being sharpened until I take the thing apart and clear it out. I usually have to go through this process several times before I'm able to sharpen my pencil. I'm sorry I bought this.Jan2010 Update - There was one pencil last week that it would just NOT sharpen, and after the pencil tip broke off for the third time, I tossed the thing in the trash. I'm done."
1,Lasted only for 10 days....,"It lasted for 10 days... and within the 10 days, I think I have used it for a total of 20 times or fewer.Now it's just a huge paper weight and manual pencil sharpener!!!Not acceptable!"
1,Not good,"I couldn't get the battery ""door"" back on once there were batteries inside, no matter how I rearranged things. It came with a piece of paper attached inside the battery compartment to show which way to put in the batteries so eventually I ripped this out, thinking maybe the door would then shut. It did not. I taped the door on as I had a lot of pencils to sharpen and wanted to just get started. Immediately the pencil lead broke off in the sharpener. I had to use a screwdriver to pry the lead out. Every fourth pencil ended up breaking off and jamming the sharpener. I'm going to return."
3,"So far, so good","Not great like my office one, but was about what I expected for the money. Don't know how long it will hold up, but using it at home. Going to keep the grands away from it just in case."
1,Worst product in the world!,"I purchased tow of these sharpeners, when I received them I got the impression that they were high quality (and by the most part its a solid design)but they did not work! I placed 3 different sets of batteries and NOTHING! I had to return these to Amazon!"
2,To much work,"This sharpener does not work well. It takes at least10 min or more to sharpen the pencil, if it does atall. I would not recommend."
4,"Works fine, but not for paper based pencil (smellcil)","For wood pencil, this works fine, but for the recycled paper based pencil (Smellcil or something), it doesn'tsharpen that well!"
1,Not worth the few bucks,"I purchased the product for my son; however, the pencil sharpener did not last for more than a week. I sharpened a total of ten times (at most) before it broke. When it worked, it sharpened decently. It is cheap for a reason, and I would not recommend it at all."
1,No!,Poor quality. Lasted for less than a month. Even though we didn't overuse or misuse it. Buy more expensive version.
2,Not very goood,"Eventually you'll get a point, but generally it takes losing half the pencil in the process. You'd be better off with a hand sharpener you can buy for .50."
2,glorified hand pencil sharpener for me,"I got this product and have not been able to make it work electrically like it should. I actually plan to get rid of it, because I think it might be too late to return it. My fiancee got it to work once, and maybe I'm doing something wrong but it hasn't worked well for me. I would have been better off spending the money for a pencil sharpener that I could plug into the wall, IMO."
1,Spend a couple of bucks more and buy something that works!,This product stopped working after the fifth sharpening. It is basically a cheap little sharpener that spins inside the case. Now it just spins and does nothing.Go to staples and get a product that works!I am returning this piece of junk!
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought it for work, so I didn't want to pay a lot and I am really disappointed. When you insert the pencil to sharpen you see the sharpener spinning and you hear the noise, but it's not doing anything. I've used it several times with several different pencils and you definately don't get a point at the tip of the pencil. Lucky to get anything. When I opened it to dump the shavings out there weren't any, so it just confirmed that it just moves and makes noise. I had a much smaller battery operated sharpener before this one and it cost only about $3 and at least it worked!"
1,BAD.,Short and simple. This product just doesn't work. No beyond that. After properly inserting. Batteries and confirming that the shaving collector was snapped securely into place I eagerly put in my first pencil and waited. Sadly nothing happen. I reinserted the batteries and got ready to sharpen pencils to my hearts content. But even though the shaving blade spun nothing happen to the pencil.Long story short. Pencil sharpened didn't work ended up sharpening 72 pencils nona old wall mount pencil sharper that's older then I am. Proof positive that you get what you pay for and that low tech works out in a pinch..
5,Torque Key,Works just perfect for what I need it before and I would deff recommend it for any drummer if you need one
4,Makes tuning so much easier,"This key has made getting a consistent sound when tuning my heads so much easier. It works as it's supposed to, and works pretty well. You will still need to do some fine tuning with a standard drum key, but this will do a lot of the work for you. It doesn't come with any kind of literature, but is easy enough to figure out on your own. Some tuning tips or something would have been nice, but it's a solid product that has really simplified what was once a frustrating process for me"
4,Well Worth the Money Spent,"This item is just a small torque wrench; however, it works very well and will tune your drums to perfection. I just have one criticism: The length of the wrench shaft should be an inch longer to allow you to reach hard to reach drum tuners, other than that, I would consider it a required tool to tune your drums with. Well worth the money invested ............"
4,Should also be made to fit Sonor slotted drumheads!,"Great tool. However, does not fit the slotted heads of Sonor drums. My suggestion: develop a bit that fits the 1/4 opening of the Evans Torque Key and the slotted lugs of the Sonor drum heads."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Koby is a girl who lives on a boat.She faces many problems,such as her parents fighting all the time and losing a leg in a car accident. One night she finds two pillot whales stranded on the beach.She holds them up all night,so they can breath through their blowholes. Can she hold them till the coastgard comes? Will the whales survive? This is absolutely the best book ever! If you love whales and dolphins as much as I do, then you have to read this wonderful book! Take my advice and read it your self!"
5,Don't Judge By Outward Appearance,"""Stranded"" by Ben Mikaelsen is a young adult fiction book about a Jr. High girl who has lost her foot in an accident and finally gets accepted at school when everyone hears about her saving two whales. The story delves into her feelings about her parents separation, school, fears of what others think about her and how she finally accepts herself. In reading this book, I learned a bit more about whales and liked the theme that was not to judge people by how they look on the outside, but to look deeper at who people really are. Her special relationship she had with the whales was interesting. I enjoyed this light, fast read very much. I think the author did a fantastic job at getting inside the head of a young girl."
4,Review od Stranded,"Koby, a young girl, has to live her life missing a foot and having parents that fight all the time, often about her, and to top it all off, she has no friends. The only thing that can set her free is dinghy and being out on the open ocean. But when Koby finds herself stranded with two pilot whales, her life changes greatly.I think this is a great book that captures you and takes you on a journey about a small girl making a big difference. This story is a wonderful story about friends that Koby never thought she'd have.If you like stories about adventure, friends, and animals, you'll love this book.~Nina"
4,The exam notes are the PERFECT review for the A+ series.,I thought that the Core Study Guide was a little bulky in a few areas...so chewing through all of the fat to get to what I felt I needed to know was difficult. This book eliminates that problem by CLEARLY covering EACH objective--and giving you EXACTLY the information you need. No matter what study guide you have purchased...review with this book and you will feel confident when you sit down for the test. (I give his DOS/Windows Exam Notes 5 stars--it is exceptional)
2,Heater core,"The heater core that I received was too long. I had to modify my heater body, so the new core would work. I don't know why they sent the wrong part."
3,imac! (and iBook )I didn't know You Could Do That,"I would like to magnified the brief review of obove mention book , please do me a favor"
5,Good choice,"When we first got this heater we were concerned that it wasn't going to heat the large room we were using it in. We are using it in our basement, which is about 650 square feet. After it had been running for a few days, though, it really heated the room well. It continues to do so. It has a lot of nice features also."
1,"total garbage, don't buy Kats heaters in any size","I bought two of these. One 1 1/2 and the other 1 3/4 because I wasn't sure where I would install it in the lower rad hose. Anyway the 1 1/2 was installed and after all that work, it didn't heat up. Ok I got a bad one and it's a pain to change. Well, I decided to plug in the 1 3/4 to see if it worked and guess what? It doesn't either. These are garbage and you should not waste your time. I got double porked on these."
1,Bought one also....,"I bought and installed one of these also. It lasted three nights then shorted out, tripping home circuit breakers as soon as I plugged it in. From the time it was installed it always seeped slightly, creating a housekeeping mess.Do yourself a favor and save the hassle of cutting (and later replacing) a perfectly good radiator hose and install a freeze plug heater from the start."
1,not so good,The product is not working as of today and has not been on the vehicle for a month. Hope it will be warrantied.
2,Dosn't work for a small car.,"I purchased the 1 1/2"" heater for my 2001 Chevy Cavalier. I had a little difficulty installing it, because the lower hose is only straight for about 3 inches. I did get a piece cut out, and the heater installed on the hose. When I plug it in, it gets hot right away...than trips the circuit breaker. I don't know if I got a bad unit, or if it is just too much heater for a little car. Either way, buyer beware if you plan on installing in a small car."
5,GREAT STUFF,"i bought it today, it has so many interesting and personalized functions, including the basis caller ID & name. It's easy to use and affordable. The sound is relatively lower but it's still a perfect cordless phone for home and entertainment.five stars."
2,disappointed,"The character of the singing is too operatic, too stagey and ""projected"" for what I want in a Lieder recital. I bought the disc on the recommendation of another Amazon lay reviewer, but am quite disappointed. Perfectly fair. This music is not easy to find (the Wilhelm Meister songs not easy to find all together)."
2,not that great foshizzle,it is as good as off brand toothpaste i have found out. it has the same ingrediants as most other brands. After using it my moputh didnt feel that clean . (...)
3,More moist,"The O'Neills Shortbread Fingers are more moist than the Walker's I usually order. They are not quite as ""sugary"", and their texture is a little more like crust of a good apple pie."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is by far one of the worst study guides I have ever seen. The book will bring up a topic and then not go into it at all. It simply states ""refer to the included CD-Rom"" exercises. The ""exercises"" are nothing more then a PDF file with lousy examples..I'm half way through this book, and don't know anything more then when I started."
3,Average...,"I've completed the MSCE NT4.0 exams using Sybex and did well in all my exams. I've come to expect high standards from Sybex in their study guides but this one doesn't meet them. Don't get me wrong, all of the information needed is covered but it makes to many assumptions as to what you currently know about W2k by not going into depth on many things. I've found my self refering to other books to fill in the blanks.This book will help you to pass the Accelerated Exam but I don't believe it will do it by itself. You will need to augment your studies with other materials. I'd recommend using Mastering Windows 2000 Server and Mastering Active Directory. Both of these books have been extremely usefull in filling in the blanks.On a positive note, there are MANY hands on excersises to follow."
2,Worst Study Guide from Sybex,"Holding the MCSE title I'm using this book for preparing the 70-240 exam. But this is the worst book from Sybex I ever read! The book skips around the themes, repeats whole paragraphs and has a lot of errors in it. I reported quite a lot to Sybex. But until today, none of them have been put onto their web site! Also there's NO such electronic version of the book on the enclosed CD-ROM as they say in the Readme.txt. This is a big misstake too! It's a pitty, really not worth the whole money!"
2,An unusual poor performance by Sybex,"Unfortunately, this book does not follow the trend of well written Sybex books. To put it bluntly, this book is miserable. It is poorly organized, full of errors and poorly written. It also wastes time with reduntant text tossed all over the place.It is also obvious that this is a ""beta"" book as it includes SEVERAL examples mentioning Alpha support. Alphas are NOT supported in Windows 2000!This book was rushed and it is painfully obvious in every way.I'm not sure there are a lot of offerings for this exam, but if there were, I would not be able to recommend this book."
1,MCSE: Accelerated Windows 2000 Study Guide Exam 70-240 (With,"This book is completely worthless! It is absolutely, positively the worst excuse for a Technical Book I have EVER read - and I've read hundreds. The material is EXTREMELY thin (MCS in 3 pages). In addition, you have to continuously flip back and forth between the book and the CD-ROM. If you want to be a paper MCSE - buy a different book. If you want to know the material thouroughly, buy a different book. (...) it has absolutely no value as a reference book! The ratings should include zero stars, since this is exactly what this book is - worthless!"
2,Less than honorable effort.,"I found this book to be very un-informative. It mentions all of the new technologies, but provides none of the in-depth information that you would normally associate with a study guide. The book also skips around between what you read in each chapter, and examples that are stored on the cd-rom. Overall I would say that this book was informative, but not worth the money by a long shot!"
5,Excellent,The only bad thing about this book is that it is the last one in the Pontypridd Series. I wish there were more
5,I love this,"I watched this film when I was really young and its completely set the precident for any film I've ever watched. I absolutely love it, it made me believe in magic. This simple plain (and slightly boring!)man was transported to a fantastic and amazing world where dragons were commonplace and wizards waged battles for the balance of power. Anyone- regardless of age should watch this."
1,An Old Classic,"DVD Review: Don't let the Warner Bros. logo fool you. This is not an official DVD release. It is a DVD-R, with playback that is worse than my current VHS edition.VHS Review: Flight of Dragons is an old classic, forgotten to time. It was a direct to video release in the early 80s and the last official release was on VHS in the mid-90s. It has not been released on DVD. It is loosely based on the books 'The Flight of Dragons' and 'The Dragon and The George' and explores the science behind dragon flight and what happens when people no longer believe in magic. Two of the main characters are voiced by James Earl Jones, and the late John Ritter. I'd recommend it to anyone with children ages 3-12."
5,I love this movie!!,"Ever since I was a little girl, this movie has been at the top of my favorites list. I absolutely love this movie. I don't know if its the storyline or the animation or both, but this movie just has all the factors in it to make a wonderful movie. And, there is that ongoing battle between magic vs. science. So, its true: kids DO learn a lot from this movie.I recommend this movie to anyone from age 5 to age 100!Go out and rent it. You won't be sorry."
4,A classic animation that's good for all ages,"The wonderful thing about a good animated film is that it lasts longer, retains more of its relevance, and allows even the old and cynical among us to catch a wisp of the free, joyful air we breathed as children, when anything was possible. This wonderful film reminds us all that anything can happen in a world as long as we believe, and is as good today as it was when I first saw it 18 years ago when I was a lad of 11. I recommend this for the adults as much as I do for the children. There's a magic about stories like this that always make you feel a little better and a little younger."
2,will not play in an xbox or an xbox HDDvD player,"I absolutely adored this movie when I was a child and jumped for joy when I saw that I could get it on dvd, only to be absolutely crushed that I could not get it to play in the xbox's at our house. In very small print it says on the back of the case that this movie is 'protected' and will not play in some players equipped with a recording device...for such an obscure movie I think that this is a bit overboard and no where in the item description does it mention anything about this at all. And I just can't afford to go out and buy a dvd player just to play one movie :("
5,EXCELLENT!,"Our family watches this movie over and over. We are desperately looking for a cd or cassette of the sound track! Is there one AMAZON? We have searched your files and can't seem to find. Please, anyone, if you know of a soundtrack availability please contact me at loricordini@yahoo.com Thanks! We are dragon lovers!!!"
5,An Absolute Classic...,"This has always been and will always be one of my all-time favorite movies. There are so few videos out there today with as much pure artistry as this one holds along with ""The Last Unicorn."" People who've seen it will also want to check out Gordon R. Dickson's novels, where the characters make further appearances."
3,Dragons,"For an older animation it is okay. It doesn't have the great voice overs of todays productions and the story does seem to drag at times, but it might be worth watching. I think it should be remade with modern techniques."
5,EPIC AWESOMENESS!!!,SO glad I found this and finally at a reasonable price.SO HAPPY!!!And that's all I have to say about that.
4,An Animated Classic,"This movie is a Rankin/Bass classic. Made in the 80's when fantasy movie actually made money, this movie as one of my favorites. I didn't see it until many years later on the Disney Channel. (I wasn't even born in 1982.) But still I loved this movie, although it isn't as good as the Rankin/Bass versions of The Hobbit and The Return Of The King.And I need to say one last thing. ... This movie was animated in Japan and the technqiues were a take off of traditional Japanese anime. ..."
1,Would Not Play At All,"I adore this movie and have since my teens, and had been waiting for at least 10 years for it to come out on DVDBut now I have a copy it will not play. Tried our DVD player, my boyfriend's Xbox and even my PC, no diceReading some of the other reviews this appears to be a common problem. Buyer beware!"
3,A Flight of Dragons,"My four year-old loves this movie. She has watched it twice each day for the past two weeks since it arrived in the post. I find it fairly corny and my wife doesn't like it at all, but it does tell a good story of fantasy."
1,Blah,"I don't like it. The illustrations and colors were decent. The storyline was dumb. Too much continuous talking, short on action, adventure, and magic. The ending was ridiculous. The character of Peter was lame. I understand some people feel nostalgic, but this movie was boring.The Neverending story was better."
5,Flight of Dragons DVD Review,"This is a classic early fantasy tale. Great for Kids and adults alike. It's very hard to find in the uk at a reasonable price; so thanks amazon.com for the exceptionally fast delivery! For the love of stories, magic, dragons, romance, and fantasy; this film is worth it's place in animated film history. Buy it; watch it. :)"
5,Good for everyone,One of the best animated feature ever. The box you see right now is not the original artwork. The cutesie artwork was probably geared towards younger (10 years and younger) audiences.Adults will enjoy this too.The producers Rankin Bass were also the ones who made the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Animated Version)and Thundercats to name a few. I wish they have a DVD format.
1,A little disappointed...,"I found ""The Flight of Dragons"" to be very difficult for a child to understand the plot as well as the language used. Although my son seemed to enjoy the dragons, he didn't fully grasp the story line. We'll see if he asks to watch it again."
1,The Pits,"If you've never heard of this movie, it's for good reason. ... The animation and music are poor, the dialogue is definitely not kid level, and the storytelling is insipid.In the first 10 minutes of the movie, we see cartoon atom bombs going off and cartoon bulldozers knocking down trees. In the same 10 minutes, a swan fails to look where it's going and runs into the water wheel of a mill along the river. This incident prompts the main wizard to launch a magical attack on the mill for attacking the harmony of nature. Fun this is not.We turned this movie off, much to the approval of our 6 year old daughter, and tried ""The Secret Garden"" (1987 version). The latter movie was excellent for both adults and kids."
5,Great movie,Great mid evil timeline based movie with very old animation! But the storyline draws you end til the finish! Must see!
4,Fun and Entertaining,"A well-animated classic forgotten by most. The ending, as was typical of its era, is somewhat disappointing. But that's probably just because I'm a Christian. The story is simple and kid-friendly; and it encourages children to use their minds. This is a good gift or a good addition to any animation collection."
5,Finally.......I found it.,"A must for all dragon fans. A smart and cool movie that's ahead of its time. The blending of magic and logic has never been explained so clearly till now. How magic inspired men to use logic (science) to build things to usher the modern age. The fact that the dragons represent man's dark ideas also shows he can defeat overwhelming odds. Enjoyable and charming, even kids can appreciate the lighthearted humor and action in this movie."
5,best movie EVER,"This is my favorite movie EVER. I loved it when i was a kid, i love it now, my kids love it. i only wish the part with the dragons getting drunk wasn't cut out..."
3,"Watchable, if not fantastic","Perhaps it makes a difference watching something like this when your younger rather than older, but I watch plenty of kids films nowadays and like them. No, it's probably the fact that it's based onThe Dragon and the Georgeand got so many elements wrong that rubbed me the wrong way. That said, it's very LOOSELY based on the book. If you can walk into it while ignoring the fact that it's based on any book at all, it, like Starship Troopers, could be a relatively entertaining ride.Three stars for neither liking (due to prejudices) nor disliking (due to quality) it."
5,Very pleased,"I ordered this movie as a gift for my husband who watched it as a kid. He was amazed, first, that I was able to find it at all and next that the quality of the recording was as good as it is. If you're looking for a copy for your collection, I suggest this one because of the quality."
4,memory lane movie,This is a very good movie. I watched with my aunt when I was a kid. I have been looking for this movie for years. I am glad that it went on DVD. The only think that makes it not 5 stars is the fact the DVD has some playing problems. It has a warning on the back that says it might not play in all systems. It works but It might not work for some of the older or newer DVD players.
5,Good useable box,"I've had this box now for 4 years and it is still working. I'm a landscape contractor and frequently use the box, including loading it in and out of the back of my truck. It holds a lot of stuff and keeps it all fairly accessible. It is light and durable. Downsides: the top organizer boxes will get brittle in sunlight (both of mine broke the tops off). And the wheels are fine over pavement but there is no ground clerance so rocks or sticks will get caught under the box when pulling it. I would still reccommend it as it is obviously still working for me after 4 years of abuse."
3,I studied primarily from this book and failed,"First off, I felt there were many errors in this book. However, I don't think the errors as a whole really contributed to me not passing. The ACRC test is truly hard, and for someone without that much experience even harder. I thought this book would have given all I needed to know, however a number of the questions on the exam(especially one fill in) wasn't even in the book. I wish I had taken the advice of a friend who told me to focus on the actual course material most of all. Duh, I thought I could simplify and just read this book. Overall I like Lammle's writing, but this time I don't think he covered all the bases as well as he did in his CCNA exam notes book. -Andy Crefeld, a_crefeld@yahoo.com"
1,Don't buy this book.........,"My copy had an ENTIRE chapter missing, I discovered this after buying it. But the publisher made up for it I guess by giving me TWO Chapter 3's. This book barely covers what is important. You can find it all in the Chappell ACRC book. I'd highly recommend buying her text, not this one. I passed the ACRC on the first try by downloading the objectives from cisco's site, and reading the Chappell text. Lammle's Exam Notes for this test is definitely not a tool for success on this exam. Don't buy it."
1,Not on the mark,I used this book among others. The book does not contain the necessary depth and breadth to pass the ACRC test.
3,Off the Mark,"This book is a good carry-round book for studying during lunch or on a trip, but it is off the mark from what you need to know to pass the test. Purchase this book only if you have other resources, specifically, ACRC from Cisco. I was dissapointed only because Lammle's CCNA book was exceptional and I was expecting the same.David Voss, from ccnamentor.com"
2,too many mistakes,"This book may work as an exam notes, but essentially it useless, because you will need a lot more to pass the test and you need to verify almost every page. Too many mistakes and printouts of router configurations without explanation for such small book. Too bad, because Todd's CCNA book is very good. Tony, CNE, MCSE, CCNA."
4,Excellent Overview,"This book is an excellent overview for the ACRC exam. It doesn't go into great depth, but states the objectives and essential information clearly in addition to providing some sample questions. It is extermely well laid out and easy to comprehend. If read along with the course notes and the Cisco Press ACRC Exam Certification guide it will provide you with enough detail to pass the exam. Skim through it the night before the exam as a quick refresher !"
3,this book is for review only,"This book is for review only ,I think you won't be able to pass the exam with this book. You need to have other books to go more in depth. I was disappointed by the questions type which they were far too easy comparing to the real test. I passed the exam studying mainly in the official Cisco ACRC course."
1,No! A mistake! Oh no another one! Oh my lord one more?,"As another reviewer said, Todd's CCNA Exam Notes is very good (I used it for 2.5 weeks to pass the test) but this one just has way too many mistakes! So is the full version too!Orphy! :-)"
5,Great training tool,Our dogs love this! We use it as a training treat and it works wonderful. It has a long shelf life but once you open it you need to keep it in the fridge. I usually cut it up and place it in baggies in the fridge. Then we just grab the bag when we want to use treats. The product is easy to handle and won't get your hands messy like other treats. It smells kind of like jerky which makes the dogs more interested in it. It is also a good option for hiding pills or for interesting a picky dog in thier normal food. Highly suggest it.
2,will only buy this in store from now on,"despite a current ""sell by"" date this product arrived stale and dry. i will only purchase it in the store from now on where i can inspect it better."
5,Excellent Book!! Please do yourself a favor and read it!,This is a beautiful and inspiring book! Read this book and you will change your life!! Saint Rose of Lima is a holy saint who will help us all in our daily lives in order that we may one day attain Heaven as she does now!! Please read!!!!!!
4,"good knife, fast shipping, arrived little dirty, poor sheath","At under $15, this knife is a good value. It's light and tough. Sword Demon sent the knife fast, but it arrived a little dirty. The knife cleans up okay though. Also, the sheath has some plastic protrusions half way down that create difficulty putting the knife in the sheath. The point gets stuck for me about half the time. And the knife did not arrive very sharp, but it sharpens well.Despite the problems, the knife gets four stars because you get a lot of knife for the money."
5,Awesome book,"This story is awsome. It is set in a suburb of Memphis and like Louis L'Amour's books the locations are real. Once you start reading this, you will not want to put it down (or go out at night). I have read Mr. Spicers other book ""Voodoo Doll"" and it is as good. I don't think he has written any other books, but he should. Great talent."
3,"Too many errors & over priced, but still a good book.","I read both the Core Module and the Win/Dos Book. Both were very easy to read and easy to comprehend. I got a very good total understanding of what was going on inside my computer. I felt I was getting bogged down with the length of these books, so to finish off my review I bought the A+ for dummies book. Together they worked fine, I passed both tests on my first sitting. What I was really surprised about is the amount of wrong information contained in this book! If I had only studied from this, I don't know what would have happened. I would never have been aware of the real answers. There also seem to be several other books out there with the same content, at a much lower price.Better luck next time David.Theresa"
4,An easy A+,"I went from a ""user"" status to becoming A+ certified in less than 30 days with this kit!! Though a bit simplified, it provided a thorough O/S and hardware overview for studying and preparing for CompTIA's exam. Thier overly simple CD and typos kept it from a 5 star. Otherwise its a great investment."
3,This is a severly simplified study guide.,"Although I did pass both tests, this study guide is a very elementary primer for the A+ tests. It really needs to re-written for the more current information of the redesigned test. Based upon what I saw on the tests, it would appear as though there are several areas that were not addressed at all or addressed thoroughly. You will not receive the most up to date information, especially about Win95, with this kit."
2,Too much $$ for too little info!,Buying two volumes you'd think you'd get a lot of useful information you could reference in the future. Instead you get a lot of filler and a bruised checkbook.
3,Not a Stand Alone Study Guide,"This is not "" Stand Alone Study Course Material"" David Groth has far exceeded many expectations by writing two well written books. Regretfully, he has also deflated quite a few also. These two books are not to be construed as stand alone course material. If you approach your studies for the A+ Certification Exams with just these two books, expect to fail. Of the two books, the best by far is the Windows/DOS Study Guide. The Core Study Guide is lacking in material and by far is the weakest ""Study Guide"". Utilize these two books, but also utilize the old standby Minasi PC Upgrade & Maintenance Guide, as well as the Heathkit and Coriolus practice exams and review questions. I was really looking forward, with great expectations, that these two books would be the new standard for the A+ Industry. Alas, we will have to continue to wait. Maybe, someday, an author will take the exam, then write the book."
3,"Quality reference, technically lacking.","The set makes a valuable reference source for a techs workstation, but for an A+ study guide it lacks in technical functionality. Anyone with little or no experience in PC repair should look elsewhere for study material. Also, the Core text should cover monitor repair more in-depth. Furthermore, it lacked key probelms such as electro-magnetic interference. It also needed to provide more information on Mac systems. In addition to lack of information there were way to many errors throughout the text that were so obvious it is amazing how they slipped past editors. Overall, if you are an experienced tech these books provide excellent refreshment, if not I advise you to look into other study sources. Finally, I felt the true quality in these books come from the prep questions. They were identical to the format of the real test."
4,Holmes quartz space heater.,"I use the heater to warm my home office in cold weather. Since I spend a lot of time in the office,Im sure it saves money on my nat. gas bill. This is my second heater of this model. the first one lasted about 5 years. One of the quartz rods died. Heater is not very effective with only one rod running. My only complaint is that you can't buy replacement rods."
4,quick warmth,Purchased for bedroom of mother who gets cold easily. Quickly heated room so she is more comfortable even on low.
1,It sounds like an atom bomb is going off,"If heat is what you're looking for then this might be your product, but if you don't want to kill yourself then I'd go with something else. This is seriously the loudest thing I have ever heard in my entire life. At first you'll think the thing is just warming up, and after about 10 more minutes of it you'll think its broken. Finally, you'll realize that its just loud. It sounds like you've got front row seats at a NASCAR race or you're actually on the space ship thats launching into space, but no, its just this new heater that you bought. Don't buy this thing unless its for your deaf brother, but it might even be too loud for him."
3,"Powerful quartz heater, slow but sure","I have twice bought an earlier version of this product, from the same manufacturer. It only used 400 watts at the low setting, but the thermostat failed after about one year. This newer model provides a sizable heat source with a relatively quiet fan. It now uses 750 watts at the low setting, but looks a bit more durable. Has a very sturdy wire and plug that does not heat up much at the low setting. It takes around 1 minute to generate warm glowing quartz tubules. If it lasts longer this time, it will be a worthwhile purchase."
5,Space Heater,I just love this heater. It's easy to use and heats up an area in a matter of minutes. I can feel the heat from five feet away. It's exactly what I was looking for and am very happy with my purchase.
2,This is a heater?,"Fairly quiet but doesn't heat well at all. Setup was easy. The bar on the front, toward the top, gets VERY hot. I took it back to Lowes the day after I bought it."
2,Lasted < 2 years,"The first thing to go was the thermostat display, which stopped functioning after only a few months of ownership. More recently, after about 20 months of ownership, there was a burning smell coming from the heater one night, I turned it off, and the next morning it would not function on the low setting. My guess is that a transistor blew, but I have yet to open it up and find out.I loved this heater, while it lasted. If only it had lasted longer."
3,"Heats well,","This heater worked well - noise level was acceptable, and it heated my bathroom well. However, after owning it for about a year it refused to turn on. I've had no success getting in touch with Holmes' warranty department."
1,Didn't last. But worked will for a few days.,"Low settings on the heater burned out after only a couple days of use. When it worked it was convenient, but the low setting burned out and the high was too hot."
5,Holmes HQH307 Heater,"Much better than the more expensive ceramic heater we used last year. We are using this heater in a 20X20 room. The ceramic heater was worthless when the temp dropped below freezing, only heating an area three feet in front of the unit. The Holmes heater keeps the entire room nice and cozy. This is used in a sun room that we use as our main entertainment room, so there is a lot of windows and subsequent heat loss. The only drawback is that this heater should not be used aroundsmall, unattended children or where there are rambunctious pets since the front grille gets quite hot."
1,used a couple of times and it just quit working,"Purchased one early this year. I have emailed the company, The Price Pros with a question, possibly a problem with the heater, and have not had any response from them. The heater itself worked fine until it just cut off and never came back on. Not a happy camper here."
3,Noisy & only works for 1 season,"Two years ago we purchased one of these heaters at Walmart. It heats decently in a small room, but ti's noisy. The following year wen we turned it on, the knob wasn't working properly and the thermostat caused it to shut off in less than 5 minutes, basically rendering the unit useless.We purchased a second one and used it last winter. Wen we turned it on again, it only works on high for a few minutes, then shuts off. We can run it on low full time, but it's not sufficient to heat a room.The plus side of this heater is the safety feature. It's very sensitive and if tipped even a little, it will shut off completely and you must wait about ten minutes before it will come back on!"
2,shuts off after 2 minutes,bought this item thinking it was a good product due to a friends opinion! its shuts off after 2 minutes AND goes back on only if u unplug and replug it!!! waste of my money
3,you be the judge....,"Length:: 4:32 MinsI bought one of these Holmes Tower Quartz Heaters on a recommendation from consumer reports. The heater works just fine to heat a room well but it does have some drawbacks in my opinion:The fan noise is louder than most. This can be very disturbing if you are trying to sleep as it cycles on and off.The light it gives off can also be a serious distraction if you are trying to sleep in the same room with this unit.It is not easy to move when it is warm.Because of these issues I have since purchased two other brands/types of heaters; this video compares the three but focuses mostly on the one that cost the least but performed the best for me:Lasko 675945 Stanley 12-Inch Ceramic Utility HeaterThe video highlights some of the basic differences and shows how they operate, how they sound, and how efficiently they produce heat.I hope you'll find the information helpful in choosing one for yourself."
1,Very dissapointed...it keeps shutting off:(,"I was looking forward to buying this model after reading all the reviews but, sadly, mine doesn't work properly. It stands well over 3 feet away from everything and the unit keeps shutting off...oh well, after Christmas I will return it for a different model. It runs for 5 minutes and shuts off. I do NOT recommend this heater."
4,A GREAT START FOR MS. ANDREWS!,I really enjoyed Midnight Peril. I understand this is Ms. Andrews' first novel. I look forward to reading her next one.
3,A good story....,"Firstly, Tracey Fobes is a talented writer. She made the scenes, characters and actions come to life. Very vivid writing. The reason I give this 3 stars is that, yes, the book starts out wonderfully exciting. It hooks you. For a while it was a page-turner, and then somewhere mid-way the fire kind of died out for me until closer to the end where it became a bit more difficult to pick up the book. The plot just conveniently ""wrapped itself up"" a bit too neatly and quickly for me with all the suspense we were forced to go thru for many, many chapters. Overall, I would recommend it because it is so different and entertaining. I will likely read another Fobes book in the future, though, to compare....possibly the one that sparked it all....Touch Not The Cat?"
5,5 stars,"Just what I was looking for; something to use for quick referencing. Not for the more advanced student of mythology, it's a pretty light read."
5,book,the book was more than expected for the very cheap price given. very happy with the results of the book
3,spiritual books,"I didn't enjoy this book. It's not an easy read. I suppose if you want to know lots of facts about myths down through the ages it would be for you. Too much about gods, and stories of how they worked and myths of the Norsemen, etc. and the Indians and well, practically everybody."
3,"Useful, a bit careless","I found this book useful as a broad survey of myths. It is an easy and enjoyable read. I was disturbed, however, by some of the sloppiness. Just starting the book I soon found some embarrassing errors. On page 11 Bierlein says, ""... the Egyptian year consisted of 13 lunar months of 30 days each, or 360 days."" No, 12 months of 30 days each is 360 days. I found other errors, using the book as a reference book; e.g., on page 71, Apsu is described as the ""sky god."" No, An (or Anu) was the sky god, Apsu was the creature representing the freshwater abyss. There are others. This is a shame because this ambitious undertaking and useful comparison is marred by careless errors that makes one unsure of what can be trusted."
5,Great Cd!,This is another one of my favorites. A must if you are looking for Christian Country. I bought several to give as wedding gifts.
1,Not at all what was advertised,"I have never ordered a used item from Amazon before, so when I couldn't find the item in a new listing I used this company's listing. They had many good to excellent reviews and a CD listed as MINT condition. When the CD arrived the case was broken and the CD was not the correct one. How could they have looked at this CD if it wasn't even the correct one. However, I did get a quick response and a refund, so I was satisfied in the end, but I still don't have the CD I wanted."
4,A good anime,In the first episode on this tape Katsumi is assgined to Robert Divice to get more training. During her training they have an unexected stopover in the Tokyo Underground where they must battle a gang to survive. In the next episode Katsumi's grandstanding cause everyone on the team to be angry with her except Yuki. Meanwhile Rally is working on a weapon that they will need sooner than they anticipated. This volume isn't as good as the first but it still worth the money. It lost one star because the first episode on this tape is a little boring.
3,"Rent, don't buy, this video","I've stuck with Silent Mobius this far, and have to say it's not enthralling me with its concatenation of cliches. From the ""oh my gosh, we're crashing into the most dangerous part of town that no one ever escapes from!"" to ""Gee, we might fight the demons better if we all got together as a team!"", the story line would be commendable as a high school project for anime amateurs, but asking me to blow the money for this volume of unimaginative mediocrity is a little much. As I'd said in my previous review, this is more a rehash of Eva than a bold, new series. Save yourself the money, rent it, watch it the one time you'll watch it in your life, and move on to something more mentally stimulating. You'll be glad you did."
2,"Lacks info, cd missing an important file","This book is ok, Big!! but it tells you things that are not in the cd-rom, example the file supp.img that the book as you to get in order to install red hat, is not anywhere in the cdrom. The cd rom has some errors."
2,The book is missing a whole chapter!,"I like the writing style, but when I went to connect to my ISP via PPP, I found that the kernel was not compiled with PPP enabled, even though the book said it was. I figured, OK, I'll recompile the kernel as the book suggests , but the chapter on updating the system is completely missing! I couldn't find help on recompiling the kernel anywhere in the book. A major oversight in a book that is supposed to be on ""Mastering"" Linux."
3,An introduction only to Linux.,This book is a long long introduction and only an introduction unfortunately. You won't be able to understand Linux well after reading this book. Some examples doesn't work. The author trying to cover everything and nothing in depth. However it might help you to make a first step(only) to the world of Linux.
1,Mastering Linux,"I had much success with Sybex books(7 books) until this one. This book is missing key parts and it reads like an instruction that comes with cheap assemble-it-yourself furniture. You end up asking yourself, now what do I do with this part?"
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"I bought this book because it was on sale and I picked it up for next to nothing. I didn't get what I paid for. This book seems geared towards people with little computer experience (anyone running GNOME or KDE does not need chapters on e-mail or netscape; any user with half a mind could find e-mail clients in their 'K' or GNOME menu or on the net and people who can't use a web browser shouldn't be starting with a book like this). The installation description is no help whatsoever; I eventually stumbled across Usenet where I found instant solutions for the problems I was having. This book takes a ""cross your fingers and pray that the installation works properly, and if it doesn't, you're stuck on your own"". This book covers too many topics and not in enough depth. I recommend buying ""Running Linux"" by O'Reilly & Associates for beginners, or ""Essential System Administration"" by the same company for people who want a little more in depth coverage."
2,Eh....,"i found this book to be very well written and i think the author did a great job of evoking a creepy, sad and dysfunctional mood. usually that works for me, but i couldn't wait for the book to end. i think the only reason i finished it was to find out what horrible thing befell the family, b/c it was clear something did. there was such buildup, i suppose the ending couldn't help but be a disappointment. also, i found the style to be mostly introspective, and that became wearying after awhile."
4,The power of the voice,"I read Joss just for the descriptions. Really, they are so fraught. Her language elevates the genre. Take, for example, this passage from pp. 52-53 of PUCCINI'S GHOSTS:""He lies in a coffin in a room without windows. There are more chairs and acryclic flowers and bibles, but I don't take in any more detail than that. It's cold. The air conditioning makes distant, electrical lapping sounds and in the glowing yellow light everything in the room looks buttered. I want to see his hands. One rests over the other across his torso and they look hard and waxy now, but I know them. I saw them lift teacups, wash carrots under the garden tap, but the surprising trust I feel about these hands means, I suppose, that they must also have spooned food into me, picked me up after falling, tidied my fringe out of my eyes, though I do not remember.""Bravo, Morag Joss."
5,Mind-blowingly good,"Straight from the anime is the fabulous Tsubasa Chronicle OST. Done by Yuki Kajiura, who has done the music for other anime such as .hack//Sign, Madlax, and Noir, just to name a few, it's fantastically good. The songs blow me away every time I hear them, and i never get tired of listening to it on repeat. A Song of Storm and Fire and Ship of Fools are absolutely fantastic, and I Talk to the Rain and Morning Moon never fail to make me pay attention. It's an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, whether you've seen the anime or not."
3,I Miss the Show!,"I only rated it 3 because I haven't seen it but watching the show for over 10 years.........I know it will be great. It's great for this to be coming out on DVD, VHS....whatever! I don't recall the first season but found it formed a lot of my life watching it each week for many years. I'd love to get my hands on the Knots Landing Reunion broadcast in Dec, 2005. Is there anywhere out there where I could purchase the Knot's Landing Reunion DVD or have they even made one?"
1,SEASON 1 OF KNOTS LANDING NOT WORTH PURCHASING!,"I never watched DALLAS growing up and thought I would check it out. I rented DALLAS SEASONS 1 & 2 and I was hooked!! I am now still anxiously awaiting to hear the word when DALLAS SEASON 6 is released. They just can't come out fast enough. I was disappointed after watching KNOTS LANDING SEASON 1. All I can say is I'm glad I never purchased the DVDs because it just couldn't compare with DALLAS. The acting was terrible. I am waiting for KL SEASON 2, since this season promises to be SO MUCH BETTER. SO PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY PURCHASING SEASON 1. RENT IT INSTEAD."
4,Where is season 2?,"Hey, come on you makers of dvds! Where is season two? If you start something you have to finish it in good time. You took our money for season one, you owe us the rest. If it's the money you're worried about, everybody knows that the first season of any show is usually not the best season, just keep 'em coming, we'll buy. Please?"
5,Double Take,"I had to take a double take when I saw the heading for Knots Landing on DVD. It's about time CBS woke up and smelled the coffee. This is in my opinion the BEST night time soap ever. I have been a die hard Knots fan since the beginning. I have longed for the day this would be released ! I only hope they have the good sence to continue with the other 13 seasons. All else I can say is, BUY< BUY< BUY !!!"
4,My Favourite Drama,"I first started watching knots in 1991 when i was 11 years old and it was shown on BBC1 during the school summer holidays (It was season 10 -abby's fake japenese company murikame & jill trying to kill val -excellent stuff!). I have since seen and taped almost all the episodes from satellite tv.To anyone new to the show, I would stress that the show gets a lot better than this first season. Like real people, the characters really grow throughout the 14 years. The stories may get far-fetched at times, but the emotions of the characters never do - they always seem real. There are some good episodes in this first season, my personal favourite being ""The Lie"" featuring the excellent Constance McCashin.In summary, an excellent series with great acting from the whole cast. As far as this season goes: good...but the best is yet to come."
5,"Its about time! The original ""Desperate Housewives""!! Bring it on!!","Finally, the wait is over. This has to be my one and only all time favorite night time soap opera. It does'nt get any better than this. Someone previously said ""Housewives"", I totally agree. Valene, Karen, Laura, they were all the original ""Desperate Housewives"".."
5,Wanting More,"I was a big fan of Knots, but too young to fully remember the first season. So I enjoyed re-watching very much. I really want more. When will the rest of the Knots seasons come out on DVD?"
4,Couldn't be without it,"Loved this show from the get go. The only reason I didn't award the DVD 5 stars was because I hoped they would include the ""Back To the Cul-de-sac"" episodes and the recent ""Together Again"" reunion, as bonus features. That would have been the icing on the cake since I haven't managed to catch them on TV here in Scotland."
3,Knot's Landing Season 1,Warning: Just recently purchased this set. Disc 4 of season 1 has major tech issues. Part of episode is missing and jumps frames. Watched end of second episode on this disc and it skipped to middle of first episode.
3,Poor quality,"It does the job. It is the second stretch machine i've owned. The back is NOT adjustable (unless you consider 2 settings adjustable). The hurley rack I received had stripped screw that fell right out, coming out of the box. One of the screws holding the legs pads on. Couldn't put it back in, as the wood was stripped. There was a rip on the corner of the leg pads. And the plastic cover to the crank is bent and crooked. Is it usable? Yes. I'm worried about the durability of this thing, given that shipped condition of it.I give it a 3, because it works, and it does the job nicely. But only a 3, because I can't see this thing lasting long term."
3,It was OK/Not Worthy of the Hype,"This book was a passable western romance. Unlikely coincidences and the heroine prevented this story from being better. I found the frequency of sexual molestation to be too coincidental and not necessary for the poignancy the author was trying to achieve. Further, the heroine was somewhat of a shrew. When she turned away from Matt after his confession, I wanted him to leave her and find somebody worthy of his love. The author was never able to justify the heroine's bad behaviour and redeem her.One item about the book that I really liked was that the hero was a virgin. Overall, I applaud the author for dealing with a difficult topic (sexual molestation of children), but this book is definitely a grade C."
4,Matt,I read the whole series about 10 years. Its a great read did not have Matt in my to keep books. So I ordered and had a good night of reading. Matt is one of the orphans in this cowboy series from Leigh Greenwood. Each story told is after the book Jake. It was great to read how these men went on with their lives. I like the series and have reread them.
1,Not What I Expected,"Since I ordered this book through Focus on the Family, I was really expecting something with some substance & in keeping with my moral & spiritual values. So I was very surprised with the light, fluffy, over-simplified approach to this very difficult topic. It might be helpful for military spouses or others faced with temporary separation, if they already have a good relationship with their children. But it fell short of offering any real insights on rebuilding and sustaining a relationship in more difficult circumstances such as divorce, etc. I was especially disappointed with the emphasis on pop culture ""things"" like movies, music, sports (encouraging betting on teams, etc.) instead of heritage & values that parents can impart to their kids."
3,Good book but numerous typos and misstatements spoil it.,"The book is very well organized and the explanations are clear and concise. In addition, it covers more topics than Ben Forta's excellent book. HOWEVER, the text and examples seem to have an extreme amount of errors.First, there are unquestionably way too many obvious misstatements. Second, either the ""typos"" in the examples are in fact errors, or if they are not errors, they are illustrating an esoteric point that is never explained in the text.I have read and studied the entire book. Many times I examined a code example and did not fully understand some part of the code. Some of these times I eventually did figure out that an interesting point was being presented. But too many times I came to the conclusion that the code was just plain wrong. This had the unfortunate effect of eventually causing me to not pay attention to an example, if it at first appeared wrong."
4,Perfect supplement to Forta,"Picked up this title after working with Forta's web app. kit as a guide for the first months of my CF development work. It fills in the gaps very nicely -- where Forta chose to cut corners, or where the example code in the web app kit doesn't quite cut it (great discription of how to do multiple adds to a table from a menu or list with multiple choices allowed).The index is more thorough that Forta's, and there are nice little goodies like a section on how to use ##s within ##s.Only criticism is the enclosed CD, which is poorly structured and makes it hard (in some cases impossible) to find the custom tags etc. referred to in the text."
5,Ben Forta couldn't do better if he tried,"When I first picked up this book, I was no more of an internet application developer than my grandmother. However, after sitting down with CF Studio and reading the first few chapters, I was fully understanding everything that Arman Danesh was trying to convey. Although it does not span the entire CF Universe (if anything can), and there are several trivial points not fully covered, the fundamental building blocks of online application development have been laid for a strong foundation in Cold Fusion Development. After reading this book, you will be able to design everything from a simple shopping cart, to an entire scalable intranet, complete with drillable information. This book goes great with O'Riley's ""Designing with JavaScript""."
2,Get another book.,"I'd pick Ben Forta's ""The ColdFusion web application construction kit"" over this horribly written excuse for a cold fusion guide any day.Beginners will find this book's layout tedious and confusing as it mixes beginning concepts with those far more advanced.Even the tag and function references are poorly organized and give no examples on their proper usage.The only use I can possibly fathom for this book is for advanced developers to give this book to beginning developers at their firm as a means to help insure their own job security."
4,Good book for bigenner,"This book is very good to begin learning CF, but if you need more advanced topic you have to search for another book. in general it is a useful book ."
1,Let's get to the point,"I don't have the time to recreate the little scenarios in this book when I need a question answered. The examples all build on the previous and *BEWARE*, in the book they like to give examples to you, then have you run them to get an error. Sometimes those errors and their verbage about why you wouldn't want to do that are on the next page. Useless as a reference and too vague in the examples given."
2,Stick to Linux Armenn....Leave CF to Forta,"After breezing through Ben Forta's book, I was excited to read the reviews for this book. I learned nothing more than how to debug and do creative editing to understand what points were trying to be presented. English Grammar classes recommended to the author."
5,Great,I have this camera and love it! I have taken some of the sweetest pictures of my Abyssinian cats and Himalayan cat with it! I think it was one of the first digital cameras on the market. My Husband bought me this camera as a gift and paid almost $500.00 for it. The quality is definately great! This camera at this price is a steal.
3,Handy camera for quick shots,"I own one of the first model Sony Mavica FD5 digital cameras that use an ordinary floppy disk and it makes decent photos. Mine has the lithium battery recharger and is able to take close-ups that are very clear. Compared to the latest digital cameras that are high resolution, you can see the difference but this early model does take very good photos and they are easy to put on any computer with a floppy."
5,The Entire Area 51!,I absolutely love this series of books! I have not finished all of them yet but have actually stayed up late reading!! While some of the books have slow spots in them - they are well worth reading and hanging in there thru the slower spots! Excellent read!!
1,Still incredibly stupid spelling errors!,"Yeah, that's what's most memorable about this cheesy book: nothing!The story stretched out too long -- and all to culminate in an enigmatic ending. This is what is known in old Vaudville as cranking it out. Ninety-five perecent of the book was total filler, and at least thirteen percent was back-fill (updating what we already learned from previous novels). The action sequences were few and far away, and not too exciting.But the worst was the spelling. Hey Bob! Get yourself a seeing eye dog! Preferably one who can spell, okay?"
4,Best since the original,"Just when I was about to give up reading the series (after a very disappointing book 3 -- The Mission), Doherty picks up the pace, raises the stakes, and tightens up the story in this very exciting sequel. I can't wait to start The Grail (book 5)."
5,AWSOME NEXT BOOK IN THE AREA 51 SERIES!,"This is an awesome book! The action just keeps on going. It keeps you guessing what will happen next in the book! I could not put this book down, it was great I was reading into all hours of the night and being extremely tired the next day! I like that he has keep Yakov in the storie he is a good addition to Mike. Duncan is becoming more adventure some now I like that about her. He sure has a mythology weaved into all four books and at the end he just leaves you hanging there! I cant wait for the next one to come out, the author said the next one will come out in a year! I wish it would come out now!"
1,Absolutely useless,The author should not be writing any books but some spend time learning something themselves. I use his earlier book as a foot rest. It is one thing to glean ideas from other books and re-writing the sentences and another thing to copy ideas that one does not understand.
1,Description is incorrect,Description is incorrectWe received the part number BOMUM4420UC but it is only 400 watt and not stainless steal as seen in the picture.
1,mis spellings throughout and very poor grammar,"When reading the first 100 pages of this book, I spent most of the time trying to correct the poor grammar of the authors. I find that when I am trying to understand the concepts that incorrect grammar, poor sentence construction, and continued run on sentences are a major distraction. Not to mention endless spelling errors made this book a torture to read. I have therefore abandoned this book as a result of this terrible writing. I am disappointed, Mr. Groth wrote the book to my CCNA course, and that was very impressive. Obviously, not one of his best works."
2,"good, but i wish it had been better","This book was good, but unless you are really really advanced you need to get another book to supplement what this one misses in order to be fully prepared. I prefer, with exams like this, to buy one book and just have to learn that. I was disappointed to have to buy another because of topics which I thought this book did not cover well."
4,Good Reference Material,"I just passed the Network+ test and this book was an outstanding good source of information. It is getting a little dated though and CompTIA is changing the test format in the latter part of 2001, so I don't know how much longer it will be totally useful. I also used ""Upgrading and Repairing Networks"" by QUE (2nd Edition) but it wasn't really needed. With the Study Guide, the sample tests on the Internet (and on the CD that comes with the book), and some experience you too can pass the Network+ test."
3,Not the best study guide,"I have been in the IT field for over 10 years, and recently decided to get my Network+ just to add to other certs I have. Though I thought I had enough knowledge to take the test without reading a book, I didn't want any surprises or waste my money. I think this book was very informative and it did help me pass the test, but I found several errors in the book, and felt like the author ran off bragging about himself several times a bit distracting. I would actually recommend this book as a Plan B, for someone looking for a good book to prepare with."
5,Excellent Condition,I am overly impressed at the quality of the delivered product deemed used. The delivery was timely and I am most appreciative to the seller.
2,Too wordy and not enough time on test subjects.,"I've read through this book 3 times and it was hard to get through each time. The book is an overall good general study book; but, I believe the author spent too much time going over nonimportant subjects. The author could have spent more time on Unix. The test that I took asked a lot of questions about Unix. I did pass the test but I was completely surprised and caught unprepared. I did pass the test but not with a good score. If you do get this book, I would suggest buying another study guide as well just to be able to compare notes and see things from a different angle."
2,Try Another Book,"I can only give this book a lukewarm recommendation since it appears to be very outdated even through it was recently published. Most examples and discussion were on Windows 95/98 and NT 4.0. Hardly any mention of Windows 2000 and almost none for Windows XP except the in the lab. Also almost no coverage of Linux/Unix. Finally, the book is not very well organized and covers the same material in multiple chapters.The virtual lab supplied with the CD in the book is probably the best part and provides some value for beginners but is too simple for most students taking Network+."
4,Very Good Test Prep,I used only this book to study for the CompTIA N10-003 Network + exam. I passed the test on the first try. Questions on the test followed closely the study material presented in the book. Had no trouble using the included virtual lab CD and practice test CD. I am very satisfied with the results from studying using this book.
2,Typos and not enough meat,"I really think this book needs some help. IF you already know the material then it is better, but for a newbie the typos and stuff are really annoying. I had to supplement the material to feel confident about the exam. Not one of the better Sybex efforts I have on my shelf."
2,He's not Todd Lammle,"I was previously CCNA certified when I took this test, thank goodness. I was hooked on the Sybex series because of Todd Lammle, what a great author he is. This book was not clear, even inacurate. Level two datagrams are called frames, not packets. Packets exist at layer 3 of the OSI model. This error kept popping up, if I didn't know the real answer I would have missed the question on the test that related to this. The book did not discuss token ring well enough for me, as I have never used it. I would suggest finding another book or going through a Cisco Networking Acadamy, you can get both your CCNA and your Network + certification that way. I felt like I wasted money on this book even though I passed the test the first time. Look elsewereAnd remember that layer 3 datagrams are called packets, layer 2 datagrams are frames...hence frame relay which is a layer 2 technology and packet filtering capabilities of routers which operate at layer 3."
5,The only book you'll need!,This book is all you will need for the N+ test. I had no knowledge of networking when I read this book. I read the book from cover to cover 3 times within a 2 month time period and scored a 94% on the test. The author ( David Groth ) knows what he is talking about!
5,Great customer service,Received product in a timely fashion and for a great price. Highly recommend this retailer!!!!!
3,Will-do-the-job bags,"These Kirby bags for the G5 were a great deal, but I was expecting a little more. When I bought bags from my local Kirby dealer, there was one type that I could purchase, the HEPA filtriaton bags. Unfortunately, they were about $25 for four bags.I probably did not read the description of these bags, and assumed I would be getting the same material as the HEPA bags; they are not. They work fine, however, and are a great deal for the price. When I changed the bag just this week, I noticed more dust in the vacuum than I had ever seen with the more expensive HEPA bags, but no matter. I would probably purchase these bags again, unless I saw a similar deal with the HEPA bags. Be sure to change them when the debris reaches the line on the bag. Beyond that, you will definitely lose suction power (another positive regarding the HEPA bag, as that did not happen. You could vacuum to the top with them!) Happy vacuuming!"
4,kirby 9 pack bags,"They work great. They are much cheaper than at the Kirby dealer or any other vac dealer. Get 2 and free super saver shipping, and your set for a while."
5,Kirby bags,The Kirby bags are genuine bags. They work well. Shipment was super fast. These bags are hard to find unless you look on the Internet.
5,Vacuum bags purchase,"I couldn't connect with my local shops becauseOf my work hours and theirs. After two attempts,Driving out of my way only to find a lockedDoor... I purchased, cautiously, online.3-4 days later I have 12 bags that will last meA year or so, it may have cost a couple of dollarsMore, but it was so worth the convenience.Even though I strive to shop locally, I thinkThat I will continue buying vacuum bags onlineThank you!"
5,vacuum bags,"It's hard to actually write a review on the product it self, they are after all vacuum bags. The seller was prompt in getting them to me w no misrepresentations at all. I'd recommend this seller, and if you have a Kirby, buy Kirby replacements."
5,value priced,The price on these vacuum bags is very reasonable. There is more product for the cost than buying thru Kirby or ina vacuun cleaner supplier. They hold up well to use. They were very easy to find on amazon.com.
4,vacuum cleaner bags,We were pleased with the prompt service and very satisfied with a quality product.
5,Product arrived fast and was as described.,Product arrived fast and was as described. Will purchase from seller in the future.
4,Kirby,I have used Kirby products for thirty plus years and have never had a problem with the vacuume cleaner or any accessories.
2,The View,"it would be helpful if the other side of the pkg was shown. I ordered what was to fit a Generation 4 Kirby and they didn't have the 2 notched cutouts that fit over the inner hose. I will probably not buy the bags again unless i can see that they will fit my machine, or i have the actual part number to cross reference. Showing that view on the web page would save you time and shipping.Kirby Generation 1,2,3,4,5,6, Ultimate G and Sentria Allergen Filtration Bags PKG of 9"
5,Thanks!,"After years of having the Kirby vacuum I was unable to use it because I was having trouble finding the bags to fit the vacuum. Look no further, these bags are excellent quality. Thanks so much!"
4,This works fine for my Kirby.,"It works fine for my Kirby, and the price is right. I would recommend it for anyone with a Kirby."
5,Kirby bags,I needed some of these and couldn't find a Kirby dealership around so I was so glad I could order them from here and hey we're a great price!
4,Sonar no cuenta nada,"Se parece a La Guaca, con casi los mismos actoresme gusto, buena filmacion, buenos dialogosbuen drama, excelente la actuacion de Mario Moreno"
4,Soñar No Cuesta Nada,"The film is good, it examines some of our most primal feelings and it does it well, it is a good watch and an entertaining one as well."
3,Just ok,The movie was slightly entertaining. It was ok not disapointed . It did have english subtitles that were good in my estimation for following the story.
3,Not very useful,"This stick holder looks like a good idea, but in the real world it is not as handy or useful as other products.First, it does not have much capacity, and second, it tends to slip down whichever stand you clamp it to when you are playing. At best it's frustrating.I recommend the Gibraltar stick holder (ASIN B0002F74CU), which can hold a LOT of sticks and stays put no matter how hard you play. If you use an assortment of stick sizes, brushes, rods and other percussion devices, I recommend investing in Regal's saddlebag-style stick bag (ASIN B0002F78NK)."
2,not as good as alternatives,"i agree with most of the previous comments. i ordered this only to meet the required purchase amount so some other items could qualify for free shipping. when i opened this package the first thing i thot was ""i could have made this myself"". it is basically a spring clamp with 2 cylinders."
3,Just buy the full length study guide.,"I would not call this a 'condensed' study guide.It has about the same amount of info as the full length study guide, but fewer pages. This results in a 'shorter' book that is harder to read and follow.My advice (having read 3 CCNA study guides) is to just buy the full length study guide and skip this 'condensed' guide. You will find the same amount of info in the full length guide, and it will be easier to read and understand.Basically, too much info is packed into many short sections which results in difficult reading. Just buy the full length guide, it will be less of a headache."
3,Buy the full book.,"This ""cheat sheet"" was a little lacking. The book does not have all the information required to pass the exam, but it is a good helper for experienced gear-heads."
5,Not bad at all!,"I haven't take the exam yet, but I find this book very useful, although there are some minor confusing error but it is tolerable because it is an honest mistake, unlike the sample test i've downloaded from osborne man.., it has a lot of mistake and you will end up confused. Buy this book and it won't waste your money. Buy intelligently, look for a review and ask some friends."
3,Out of Date,This book focuses around the 4xx series of test that have been discontinued by CISCO. I'd recomend other great titles that are more current for the 5xx series of test.Cisco CCNA Exam #640-507 Certification Guide (With CD-ROM)
4,It is Definitely a good book,"It is a good revision book. I would treat it as revision book. I spend about two hours on re-reading this book before going to take the exam. It can refresh me all the key point, all the important notes in CCNA exam. If you just use this book for your exam, I think it is not 100% to ensure you can pass, so I use it with another study guide also by Todd Lammle. I would also like the part of ""Exam Essentials"" that can let you know what are the CCNA exam emphasize on, so that you can pay more attention on them. All parts of the content are good enough to let you pass, eg. IOS, LAN switch etc. But the materials about WAN is not good enough actually, even I have read the study guide(not this exam notes), I still cannot 100% handle all the questions about WAN, eg. sth about ISDN, Frame Relay etc. You may need other materials for supplement(I get 75% on WAN protocols).Anyway, it is a good book"
4,"A ""Coles Notes"" Book for the CCNA Exam",This book is only a summary of the overall CCNA course. I would recommend this book as a compliment to the CCNA Study guide by the same author. My suggestion is to purchase the Study Guide and use this book to summarize what you have learned.
2,Too many errors in book odviously not proofread,"When you get to about the middle of the book -- finally -- you get to the simple broadcast address, subnet mask calculations and several of those are wrong or have horrendous typographical errors (I.E. no, ""255.255.255.255.252"" is not a valid netmask...) Its like no one even proofread the thing. The same page referred to has other errors as well. I was really disappointed with this book.On the other hand the content and depth of topic coverage is good."
4,"Not the complete test, but you can pass with it.",I read this completely once and then went back and re-read certain sections. I read it after I read the Study Guide twice. I work with routers everyday and the Exam Notes are for the person that already knows the fundamentals. A newbie will be lost. This gives you about 80% of what you'll need to pass the test. I took the test today and made a 81%. Thanks Todd.
3,There are better books,I would recommend that if you are pursuing certification beyond the CCNA that you instead purchase a CCNP book as it will more than cover what you need to know about the CCNA and will save you a couple of dollars.
4,nephew loved it!,"looked as good in person as it did in the picture. my nephew, who is going thru a ""skull and flames"" phase, is very happy with this gift."
1,Does NOT have a lifetime warranty!!!,"I bought this product because I had had a similar GE timer purchased from Home Depot for less than $10. But after a year it quit so I looked in Amazon and found this one. On the product page it says ""lifetime warranty"" three times.With a lifetime warranty it would be worth paying 60% more.When the product arrived I carefully looked over the packaging carefully and no warranty is mentioned at all. So I emailed Amazon and asked, they referred me to the Vendor ""Hardware Solutions"" @ 888.548.4484 ask for Jim ! ext 1405... he say absolutely NOT. This product only has a one year manufacturer defect warranty.I am sending it back and going back to Home Depot.PS I would give this product zero star if the system would let me."
3,timer,"cable is way two short and the plastic around the plug is so bulky , had hard time plugging it in ."
3,OutDoor Light Timer,"This timer may be okay,but the instructionswith it was,nt very clear.I have not gotit to operating yet.Maybe i will,but ifi don,t,i will not be buying another orpaying the return shipping charges forthis one.I would most likely think thiswould be a shoddy or cheaply builtproduct and move on to another product.Thanks&Best; Regards,Bobby."
2,photo cell didnt work out of the box,I had a bad experience. Photo cell did not work at all. This was the reason that I purchased this unit.I threw it in the trash and had to buy a intermedic mechanical so I can count on the on-off operation.
1,No time for timer,"I puchased this timer two months ago because it had all the features I was looking for. It worked great for about 40 days, then quit working. I emailed Sylvania about the problem, but have never heard back from them. I would not recommend this product."
3,Mostly works,"I'm generally quite happy with this, especially for the price, and the dusk to dawn timer works fine, as does the 2 hr and 4 hr setting. But the 6 and 8 hr settings run dusk to dawn"
2,Didn't last long.,"Worked well for a few months then it stopped working. We live in San Diego CA so it wasn't exposed to extreme weather conditions, so it was disappointing that this only worked a few months."
5,Great product.,"Great product, dusk to dawn works great.I love it.Now there is no more trips to the outlet to turn on and off."
2,Only OK,"This was supposed to be programmable and it does not work . it stays on from dusk til dawn. I'm disappointed, bit it's only powering one small light, so it's no big every drain."
1,Dead on arrival,"Despite the positive reviews, my device arrived dead on arrival. The lights would contantly flash on and off, and the contsruction is extremely cheap and flimsy."
1,Works well for a short time,"Purchased the Sylvania SA200 10 AMP Outdoor Timer with Light Sensor July 2011. Worked well on a bug zapper before I took it out of service in September 2011 and worked for about one week after plugging it in early May 2012. Says ""Life Time Warrantee"" on the product description however Amazon is not clear on how to get a replacement. It is going in the trash where it belongs!"
1,Rain will kill this timer,This timer stopped working once it started raining. It shorted out and would only work on the ON setting. Then shortly after that it stopped working all together. Outdoor timers should work in all weather.
1,Mis-leading title WARNING THESE ARE SOUR SQEEZE POPS NOT THE SWEET ONES,"I ordered this for my sister because we used to eat these when we were little. Three months after she gets them, I visit her and see that she only ate about half of them and was planning to give the other half away part of xmas gifts. Why you ask? Because I purchased them on Amazon, not knowing that they were sour squeeze pops. Everyone likes the sweet ones and the sweet ones were the original squeeze pops. All the other vendors title the sour squeeze pops ""sour squeeze pops"", but these guys didn't even have the decency to put the word ""sour"" anywhere in the description. The only way to know that you are ordering the sour version is to enlarge the picture of the item and hunt for the word ""sour"" on the box. I felt deceived, and would rather do business with another vendor for a buck or two more than a dishonest one."
3,"Meh. It works, mostly.","I ordered this because I needed a small, portable AA/AAA charger to fit in a suitcase. Basically, it works, but leaves a lot to be desired.Unlike other chargers, this one doesn't give you any idea of where you are in the charging process. As C. MacPhail noted, the single charge light comes on, and remains lit even if your batteries are fully charged. It gives absolutely no other feedback.This was the smallest charger I could find that will charge AA or AAA batteries.It *does* work, so long as you can just plug it in and walk away for 7 hours, and don't want any feedback.In summary, it works as advertised. I'm just not that thrilled with it, and will replace it as soon as I find a better alternative."
4,Great product for the price,"I bought this item for my wii remote controller, they work great! battery life is great!"
5,Learn more about the Ferengi!,"The book is excellent, but the audio cassette is even better as Quark narrates with his unique style. If you enjoy the Ferengi, you'll love Legends in both book AND audio form. True to Ferengi nature, they hold back several rules for future purchase. Excellent!"
5,"MS. RICE , MOVE OVER FOR THE BIG GUNS.","This book is ver savy, modern ,but also capatures the historical essence of VAMPARIA. A wonderful new slant on the legacy. I bought all his other books after reading this one."
1,Saints and Shadows is a bust,"I am sorry to everyone who liked this book but you are just wrong. I am a real lover of urban fantasy and was interested to read this book. I have enjoyed Jim Butcher and Ilona Andrews and Patricia Briggs and even some of Laurel Hamilton's work (the early ones), but this book was just terrible. Its plot was paper thin and the characters were completely cookie cutter with no depth. The bad guys were pure evil and the good guys pure good. The romance was predictable and boring. It was as if someone took the best of the urban fantasy books and said, ""I am going to write one too and do it one week"". I have no interest in trying this author again and recommend that anyone who reads this review head to the other authors that I have mentioned."
3,it was only so so to me,"I didn't really enjoy this book. It was slow to me and i had a hard time getting through it, it didn't grab me. To many side stories that kind of lead nowhere and too many extra characters."
3,Good till the end,"I hated the ending. The book was excellent up till that point.I'm not talking about the 'final battle', just the whole epilogue part, what happens after.I'm torn as to whether to continue the series or not. I rarely just read one book in a series. The author wrote very well, so I want to read more, but I don't see how the story can continue in a way I will like."
4,"the book is good,slow to start,great to finish.","The book is something i have mixed feelings for.I will tell you strait off that this is the first vampire book i have read,and also that I now plan to read a lot more.It is a little slow to start but at about mid-way through the title,i found myself unable to put it down,something a book hasnt done to me in a long while.It is much diffrent than the usaual vampire things you have read/seen,it comes up with fresh new ideas that will constantly keep you reading.Some of the character devolpement is subpar but it isnt going to be perfect."
3,Not for the faint at heart . . .,"And I'm not even that faint! I tried to read this book, really I did. I throughly enjoyed this author's other books, both his young adult works and particularly his 'Buffy: the Vampire Slayer' books. But this one was just too much for me. I'm 20 years old and found myself disturbed by the graphic imagery. From the vivid description of a dog being eviscerated to sticking crosses in unnatural places, I was trying to find a reason to keep going. I did find myself intrigued by the new mythology on vampires that was presented and that kept me curious enough to go on some. But one can only take so much. If you are thinking about reading this book because you enjoyed the author's other books, take care that you are stronger than me."
5,EXCELLENT!,This is the first book in a four book (so far) saga commonly referred to as the Shadow Saga. Very unique take on the vampire mythology and wildly entertaining! Highly recommended!
4,good read!!!,I'm not much of a writer but a good non-romantic vampire story. Waiting to receive the 3rd installement so I can finish the series.
5,"Great Product, Great service.",My books arrived on time and even though they were used they all looked brand new and it was even wrapped up.
5,An iconoclastic review of leadership.,"The Learning LeaderDouglas Reeves is no fool. He does not accept convention wisdom and openly challenges many beliefs that are taken for granted in the writings leadership. If you thought that this was another book among the thousands examining leadership, you will be wrong.This book is for the cognoscente. It is not for readers first entering the field because it analyses the analyses and beliefs.If you are looking for a different and challenging view of leadership, this book is worth the time and money."
4,All About The Girls!!!,"""Girls Town"" is a movie I have wanted to see for a minute and a half. At one time it was hard to find, Thank GOD I was able to find on Amazon. I waited patiently and it paid off. Such a good movie with a story line that never gets stale. Great chemistry between the ""girls"". And, currently, I'm all about my girl Lili Taylor. She seldom disappoints. She has an actors face and an actors attitude. She melts into whatever role she is given. She is definitely in the right profession. ""Girls Town"" makes you want to see what more she can do. Extremely diverse actress. It's all about those eyes. She sells it all day."
4,I like Area 51,I started reading this book before I realised there were others in the series (should have done my research) but have to say I really enjoyed it.Actually I enjoyed it so much I have now started reading the whole series from scratch.Buy it - you will enjoy it!
5,Area 51: The Grail,"Like most of Bob Mayer's books, real hard to put down once started. A very prolific and talented writer to say the least."
5,"Intriguiging, Quick Read","Even with the typos, I have been enjoying this series tremendously. The Grail and Excalibur were two of the better in the series. It would be a nice feature on my Kindle to be able to send a quick link to the author or Amazon while reading indicating when I find an inaccuracy or a typo. Kind of detracts each time I find one of these, but I am still enjoying the content of these books."
4,Another good one!,"Another good book in the on-going series. Once again the story is clarified but still leaves many, many unanswered questions. The pace of this book is a little quicker than the others with a little less detail but overall provides a page-turning experience. Like many of you I'm almost ready for all the answers!"
1,Horrible,"This book is horrible. It is a rehash of worn out ancient astronaut ideas. Worse it takes over 100 pages before you feel remotely comfortable with the book. If you read the other books first it might not be so bad, but the book assumes that you have read the other books. The author just all of a sudden mentions things like a ""nuclear explosion in China"" leaving the reader thinking ""what nuclear explosion."" To add insult to injury the end of the book is predictable and it doesn't really end. It just stops. If you want to know what happens you have to wait for the author to write a sequel and then hope that one ends. Stay away from this book. It's a struggle to get through and leaves you cold when it's over."
5,Wonderful Resource,"If you have been putting off getting your MCSE and am anything like I was, ""Next month I will start preparing for my MCSE."". However, I had no place to begin.This is the place to begin. Buy this book, READ this book, and you WILL have a better knowledge of computer and network basics.If you are currently working in this field, you'll even understand some of the things you've troubleshooted in the past - it all comes clear."
4,"If you love handtools, you'll love this book.","The book gave me greater appreciation of pioneer craftsmen and the tools they used.When you realize the limitations of materials and power, it's amazing that we have some many examples of expert craftsmanship that have survived to the present."
3,out dated,"Already quite out dated.... not very useful! i.e. Carl's Jr now has the turkey burger, Cheesecake Factory has cheese cakes made with Splenda, and not very thorough, a lot of obscure ""business dining"" could have had more average casual dining places."
4,Could be helpful.,"This could be a helpful book if you were just starting out on the diet. Once you have read more about the diet, it is probably not as necessary- you will know what to choose yourself."
5,Great guide,A friend and I were starting this diet and we wanted to read up on it this was the best book out of the bunch since i am always on the go
5,Good Info,Great info in this book - great to download to phone and have handy when you visit a restaurant .
2,not worth it,unless you live in a big city with lots of chain restaurants it is pretty usless. Listings are by chain not food type.
5,South Beach Diet is Now Even Easier!,"My husband and I gave South Beach a try, but we gave it up about a year ago. The recipes were just so time consuming and the ingredients seemed pricey. We did experience some wonderful results, though. Well, now that more microwave meals are available and meal replacement bars, as well as a 30-minute meals cookbook and this guide, we've decided to give it another try.This guide is wonderful. It lists all of our favorite chain restaurants. We had no idea there was anything low-carb at one of our favorite mexican restuarants, but sure enough, they offer up fajitas in lettuce wraps. And even for local restaurants not listed, this book gives you ideas on what to look for on all menus. This great resource is just another way South Beach doesn't even feel like a diet."
3,South Beach Diet Dinning Guide,This book is an excellent source of information for when you are dinning out. I wish they had included more brand name restaurants in their book but at least its a very good source of general information if you go by the type of food you will be eating instead of looking for a specific restaurant.
2,Not very helpful,I didn't find this book to be very helpful. I loved the South Beach Diet book. But this book only gives recommended dishes which is basically meat or salad. I would have liked to see the nutr. values for more food in each restruaunt so I could decide which one I was willing to have based on carbs and sugar.
2,not worth it unless you need to carry it with you at all times,"The information in this book is basically the same information that's in the South beach Diet book. It is ""pocket sized"" which makes it nice to carry around if you need to. It also tells you what to order at major chain restaurants. I personally wish I would have skipped it, but I'm sure some people will find it useful. I was expecting it to tell me something the main book didn't."
2,"Good idea but this publication is 7 years old, many of the restaurant menu items no longer exist, does not list new restaurants","Needs to be updated with current market information, can find more information via the internet website via restaurant nutritional information. Many of the menu items listed no longer exist, and there are many popular restaurants (Cheddars, PF Changs, etc.) missing - look in the App store for more updated information...this book had me at ""South Beach"".....and I did not pay attention to publication date...."
3,South Beach Restaurant guide,"For one working with the South Beach Diet, the book is a great bible for ""eating out"". Keep it in the car before selecting your dining plan."
1,Journey to the Center of Creation,"Didn't like this book at all! Outlandish claims, disorganized writing, and flatout fantasy. If I had picked this book up expecting fiction perhaps I would have been less disappointed."
1,I was supposed to get two but only one came,I was supposed to get two lamps but only one showed up. I returned it because I don't want to attempt a second order.
3,50/50,"The delivery was very quick and came over the weekend. I got two sets. One set looks very high quality and has a wonderful pink glow to it. The other set of two came as a blackish color and I ended up having to put a higher watt bulb in order to get much of a glow. They still are ok I guess. The price I paid it was still a very good deal, especially for the two that are great.As for the food grade salt, I never got that part but I didn't care about that so much. It is just disappointing when they say they will include something and don't."
4,Salt lamps,Got 2 sets of 2 salt lamps (4 in all). One set the lamps were different colors. Three lamps had totally broken bulbs and one had a smashed socket. Paid a lot for shipping too. Otherwise lamps are nice. Too late to send back as these were presents. Will find a new socket and already got new bulbs. They were priced right so not worth sending back as a new set might come the same way.
2,Wont take chance,After reading all reviews. I have decided not to purchase.ForI fear I will not receive the 2 lamps and pink table salt that is advertised.Too much of a chance at Christmas time.
2,[...],"It is only about 80 (small) pages long and tells you nothing you can't find out for yourself on the INS website (www.ins.gov) In fact, it IS the INS website verbatim. Loads of forms and the usual 100 questions you see every where else. The only useful bit was the list of countries allowing Dual Citizenship."
1,Too small!,"I didn't check the dimensions on this board before ordering it--what a mistake. It's very small and the pieces are tiny. Worst of all, the pieces don't fit together when you're ""kinged,"" they just rest on top of each other (the pieces don't have ridges to lock them together). Huge waste of money. I just wanted a nice family checkerboard, but this one is more like something you'd play in an elevator or a tent."
2,picture of it not correct,"wood expressions checkeres set.....I would have liked to see more contrast on the board with the squares..in the picture it showed it quite differently and I was disappointed when it showed up, because of the price I didn't bother to return it...I am still ""looking"" for a checker board game made of wood with a lot more contrast.. Its easier to see, being a senior with tired eyes, I need the contrast.... If its ever made differently, I will buy it.. I love the game.."
3,not real wood,"I bought this for my brother for his birthday. The board is solid and fuctions just fine. The only complaint I have is that the picture shows REAL WOOD complete with knots and all. The picture- even on the box- looks very pretty. But, the product itself is made of particle board and is not as nearly as attractive as the picture on the box. This does not effect the performance, it just is kind of rip off to show one thing on the box and have something differet in the box."
2,Fatal flaws in this checkerboard set,"I bought this set because I wanted something that would be very sturdy and I liked the fact the the pieces would store into the board itself when not in use.Well, upon opening the box we realized that the wooden playing board had 2 long cracks in it - not what I was expecting. How can they even ship such a mess?And, more vexing, the checkers do NOT fit each other for crowning - the makers do not even pretend to make them fit together. This is such an OBVIOUS thing that is desirable for a checkers set, how on earth can they miss this?The ""stars"" that you use to rate this product do not really apply well to the product itself, so its ""1 through 5 star rating"" is not really accurate. I would gladly have just about any checkers set other than this one after I got it. Even a cheap plastic set is better than this thing. Sorry I wasted my money on it."
2,to small,"it was not the size i expected, it's ok for children i guess but not for those really into the game"
3,Checkers,"Checkerboard quality superb and self storage of checkers great plus, especially for kids. Quality of the checkers and difficulty stacking them for ""kinging"" was disappointing. Excellent delivery as promised since needed for gift; little ""pricey"" considering checkers. Couldn't find email link to contact seller directly to see if other checkers were available that fit into storage slots. Improve checkers and you have a fantastic product.Thanks,Grandma4"
2,not worth the money,"A very excited eight-year-old opened this game and wanted to play it right away! I was looking for a durable alternative to the folding cardboard games as I knew that we would be playing this game for years.Unfortunately, this item is NOT as well-made as it appears to be. The paint is sloppily applied, there is a ding on the board, and the checkers are small and do not stack. Although they say that they are grooved, which led me to think they *would* stack, they are only grooved on one side, which causes them to slide. They also vary in size. It is not a good game for little fingers.My options are to either touch up the paint and order different checkers or return it. I sense a return in our future."
4,Wood Checkers Set,"This is a well made set with places on the board for storage of the pieces. It is better suited for children as the pieces are on the small size, but overall a nice set."
4,Hooked on Swedish Police Procedurals,I started on the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Series) and then found the BBC edition of Wallander. From there I discovered the Swedish version and am hooked on the series. I wish the access to the complete Swedish edition was more available and economical. I too have found the original Swedish characters more interesting than the BBC version. Please make the original more economical.
3,Worth a look,"I've seen three Wallanders: Rolf Lassgard, Keneth Branagh, and Krister Henriksson. I put Henriksson at the tail end of this group, but that isn't necessarily a cut. I like them all. Lassgard and Branagh can both be so volcanically emotional that Henriksson pales in comparison. Some might say that is a good thing.I've read ""Before the Frost,"" and as far as I can remember this version is fairly close to the book. I enjoyed it. Henriksson is surrounded by an able cast and like all Wallander dramas, things are always slightly on edge."
1,"long, expensive and stupid","oh my oh my, I have rarely spent my money in the worst way possible.the idea was weak, the acting was weaker and the final was an apotheosis of insipid , washed out plot.Verrrrrry baaad indeed"
1,"One of the worst among Zhang Zi-yi's career, but it's not her fault","It is quite rare that I did not even want to finish watching a film. But this movie is beyond just a bad make. The directorship, the script and the performance in combination is probably one of the worst among recent Chinese films. Zhang Zi-yi tried. But even the best actors in the world cannot salvage a movie under such poor construction. The dialogue is as ridiculous as it can be. Joan Chen's performance is as her usual- plain and phony. Cinematography is the only thing worth given some credit. What a waste though. This movie is a rare trash."
1,"Nice pics, not enough detail","I planned to use this book as a sole study guide for this exam, however I didn't think it went into enough detail and at times had to use the net to understand some of the features. After using the 70-210 book to pass that exam, I went into the exam feeling prepared after reading the book however quickly found out that the book didn't contain enough info to pass the exam. Its ok to get you started with W2K Server but left me 100 points short on the exam!"
2,You will fail if you rely on this,"I'm a tech trainer who has relied on Sybex in the past, so I grabbed this the second it appeared. I also used Microsoft's self-study kit. Having taken and passed 215, I can honestly say that this guide is very ""soft-core"". It doesn't give you the details that you will need, so use Microsoft's guide for the time being. ...you will not pass if you are using this book as your sole guide. I make a point of steering my students away from this Sybex guide, at least until the 2nd edition comes out. Sybex obviously ""rushed to market"" with this."
5,Another winner from Sybex,"I've always been a fan of the Sybex MCSE Study Guides because they do the best job of getting you through the exams. When I go to take the exams, I feel like I'm back at my computer at home taking the EdgeTests on the book's CD. The Windows 2000 Study Guides are the best yet. They cover all of the material required to pass the exams. The book itself is very readable and informative, but the included CD is equally valuable. The new WinSim shows you exactly how to accomplish almost all of the administrative tasks that are performed in Windows 2000. There are so many questions in the EdgeTests that you will know the exam like the back of your hand when it comes time to get certified. The Palm and PC flashcards were just another great tool included on the CD. None of the other publishers, including Microsoft Press, measure up to Sybex when it comes to MCSE Study Guides. Sybex just seems to put more into their books than anyone else."
1,This guide WILL NOT get you ready for the exam.,"I used this book along with the Virtual Test Center, and it will not get you ready for the exam. It is a nice step by step tutorial. It should be sold as a reference instead as to what it claims to be. If you are new to W2K Server this will be a good introduction."
1,Do not expect this book to help you pass the exam.,"Vague. That is the word I use to describe this book. As a fan of Sybex materials, I say this with a heavy heart: RUN FROM THIS BOOK! Run like the wind. The only thing this publication will do is pump your ego to the point of you saying, ""God has smiled on me today. I will pass the 70-215 test with little or no effort, for I have mastered much more than what can be found in this great and noble tome. Windows 2000 Server is my friend, and it will not let me down."" There is NO detail at all, and the index is HORRIBLE. Maybe the Dummies book would do a better job."
3,"Ok book, but don't expect to pass....","This book will help in studying some of the concepts for the 70-215, but will not help very much in passing. Almost all books do not cover what is really on the test( I took test in Dec2002 ). The subjects and wording of the test is different than just about anything that you will encounter in the MCSE/MCSA books."
5,Brilliant!!!!,"A. Kingsley Bishop has thought of everything! You name it and she can tell you VERY SIMPLY how to organize it. I have always been a very organized person myself, but I am constantly looking for new ideas. This book definitely provided me tons of great new strategies for organizing my home, better yet my entire life! Bishop is brilliant! If you want to save yourself time , money, and a lot of stress then READ THIS BOOK!!!"
3,Great beginner tutorial BUT ....,I thought this book was presented well and excellent for a beginner who wishes to use Front Page. BUT .. I was very frustrated while trying to load Lesson 3.... The version of the CD I had was in error .. Good luck! (I would have given this book 4 stars if not for the problem with the CD.)
2,Not a general overview - Just reworks an already made site.,"Reworks an already made Morgan Park Zoo site. A very nice web site, but not much guidance for making your own site from scratch. I would not recommend this book if it were your only Frontpage 98 text."
5,Brilliant and Truthful,"Rolling away is a brilliant book. It tells the honest truth about what some people concider to be a harmless pill. For some, once you try ecstasy your hooked; it's hard to break free and Lynn does an excellent job in describing and explaining the horrors that she went through trying to get herself clean. You can go on any website or even google the effects of ecstasy but nothing is better than hearing, well reading in this case, something that actually happened to someone.Lynn shares her whole life story. She explains how easy it is to get hooked, how it feels to be addicted to something and how hard it can be to get your life back. She tells about the show she was on that MTV aired called, True Life: I'm on ecstasy, and explains about the brain scan that her doctor had done on her and the results are scary but so true.This book is for anyone that has ever done ecstasy, knowns anyone that has ever done E, or just for anyone that wants a great true story to read."
1,an exaggeration,"I went to the same high school as Lynn...I'd just like to warn any potential readers that the book is full of exaggerations and outright lies. I read the book out of curiosity, and found myself constantly saying ""That's not true, that's not how that happened!"" Consider yourself warned...this book needs to be read with the same scrutiny as a James Frey book."
2,you have to be a sports fan for this,"I'm not a sports fan, but I figured it would still be funny. Michael Strahan does deserve a break in comedy. He should at least be invited to film an episode of ""SNL."" However, this was not Chris Tucker or Margaret Cho-caliber work. It shows football players and coaches being a bit funny. Only if you are used to these men being so serious and professional would you find the contents here entertaining. Then again, there were some funny moment regarding flatulence. Outside of comedy, I learned what a K-ball is and how the rule on it was eaten by its exception. Strahan does spliced-up old interviews like Jay Leno does. This disc is really for men whose favorite time of the week is Monday nights in the autumn."
4,wall charger,"This product has worked great. The cord is a little short, but have had no functionality issues."
4,"Imaginary solvers, real solutions","This collection of 130 problems encountered or created by the inhabitants of Wohascum County is a delight. While the people and location are imaginary, their math ability is exceptionally real. Most of the problems are adapted from classic themes found in contests such as the Mathematical Olympiad and other problem sources. The difficulty varies, but few, if any, are beyond the understanding of the talented undergraduate. Complete solutions to all problems are included. Necessary prerequisites to each problem and a subject list are found in the appendices.A rich source of material for problem solving groups, preparation for competitions, or special credit courses, this book belongs in all academic libraries.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."
2,A let-down,"Jon Krakauer's riveting book ""Into Thin Air"" was my original impetus to start reading books about climbing Everest. The psyche of people willing to risk serious harm and death in order to climb that mountain is fascinating and I am always interested in reading yet another perspective. I was, however, rather disappointed by ""Fragile Edge.""Coffey's story of love and loss is ultimately quite bland. Joe Tasker made it clear from the beginning that she was not that important to him and that she had to fit into his life on his terms. Their relationship was almost non-existant since he was always either away climbing a mountain or preoccupied with planning his next expedition.Coffey comes across as a rather immature girl, in love with the idea of the daring mountaineer, rather than the man himself. There is nothing compelling about their relationship and the trip she takes to vist Everest after his death comes across as being completely pointless."
5,Just delightful,I am addicted to these mints now! Unexpected but really tasty. And sugar free? Sign me up! The only problem is not knowing how to stop eating these. :)
1,Not Too Minty!,"I enjoy really strong mints and these just don't do that for me. I've been an Altoids fan for years and wanted to try something different. While they taste unique (and good!), I can't recommend them as a true minty mint. I'm sticking to Altoids, but others may find these pleasantly different."
5,Curiously Different...,"I'm not a mint fan, but got some from a friend and was hooked! Altoids and most of the others have a really 'minty' feel which doesn't sit well with me. These mints are refreshing, but not overwhelming...nice change!My only complaint is that there hard to find. I want to my local Whole Foods and they don't carry them or any other health food stores...maybe a new product?Anyway, I would recommend if you want something different. A plus is the container which is very cool and can be re-used to store change, etc.Great job guys!~Selma"
5,Healthy Mints!,"Green tea is becoming very popular for many health reasons. Now it is available in mint form! Is is not over powering mint, yet extract of green tea kills germs that can cause bad breath. I've recommended this items to many of my friends and given them some samples. They all like it. It comes in nice tin that looks like traditional green tea is stored - making it a great gift item. One of my Japanese friend made it a gift at her wedding to her party. I like all three kinds, but my favorite is the pear. Some organic food store carries this product, but they are usually charging $5/can."
4,Senecha Green Tea Mints Variety Pack - Fabulous!,"These mints are fabulous - Organic, and delicious! Plus, they are made with green tea. I would recommend them to anyone! I have to keep a supply on hand as everyone raids them when they come to visit."
3,Not quite what I wanted.,"I was comparing various wool-blend socks, and decided another brand was more what I wanted. However, I had gone too far into the ordering process and instead of backing out of the order, it was processed! I didn't even give the correct password! The percentage of wool in the pair was lower than I wanted. I don't yet know how they worked, as they were a gift for an oil worker & he's out of town. The heat feature also was important, and these socks do have that. Be sure to select what you really want, as the order may go through!"
1,"~ ""Those poor trees"" ~","That a few trees had to give their very all for this is a crying shame.If the ""Hendrix Family"" are looking to sue someone, this ""author"" should be prime fodder for those lawyers to help buy their children braces.A shame against the Hendrix name."
3,"Do Not Buy This DVD, Buy a Book with it Included for $20 Less","12/6/05: You can get the DVD disk with SuSE 10.0 included with the book ""SuSE Linux 10 Unleashed"". Save yourself $20 and get the book and DVD instead of just the disk.2/20/06 Update: I had this version of Linux up and running for 3 months with no problems. I installed it on an Intel Server that previously had Windows Server 2003 installed. With Windows I could not access the Internet. The SuSE install went very smooth, much better than Windows. SuSE did an excellent job of detecting the hardware and installing the drivers. Downloads from the Internet are faster than a Window machine using the same broadband connection.This is a great OS for the casual PC user. It comes with browser, e-mail, word processor, spread sheet. What else would a typical user need? Why throw away money on Windows and MS Office?"
1,One star is way too many on my journey ...,"On day 2, so far my pc is disabled, using a friends computer and he is trying to figure out why it generates errors and locks up the screen freezes with x something or another.Thinking of value, the only value is now I can say my pc has been wiped out, maybe next time I will be wiser. Well, how much is Windows XP again??? That is the wise choice, something that works and actually does not render a pc useless."
2,Very Disappointing,"I wish I had saved my money - nothing but cons for me!I was using SuSE 9.2 and did a clean install to 10.0. Here is what I experienced:- No source DVD in package- Many packages missing E.G. Audacity (referenced in the quick start manual), some available however from other repositories such as packman- No printed administrators manual- No ax.25 / Ham Radio packages - show stopper for me- Two sound cards not working (OK in 9.2)- Perceptibly slower than 9.2 everywhere- Web browsing noticably slower even after disabling IPV6. Firefox is 2-3 times slower loading pages on SuSE 10.0 compared to Windows XP- Konqueror is even slower than Firefox and chokes on some Novell support pages :-(- Crashed three times in two days (possibly related to random screen savers)I have now removed SuSE 10.0 and replaced it with Ubuntu 5.10. Note that I have been a SuSE user since version 7.2 but my experience with 10.0 means this will most likely be the end of my relationship with this once great release."
5,The best linux distro,"Easy to install, and so secure, people who complain may have a problem pushing the ""on"" button of a computer. Easy to use and loaded with applications.Much better than Windows XP, and comes with much more software than a Mac computer. Only the display drivers could be of better quality. Put the blame on Nvidia and Ati not Linux.Highly recommended distro for everyone - except gamers - who cares about security, ease of use and stability"
3,Windows of the Linux World,It has been branded as such. Windows of the Linux World. It has a huge GUI interface. So why not just boot Windows? If you want a CLI Linux that actually runs more like Unix than Windows then get Slackware instead (and its free).
1,nothing but problems..,"I plug in the suse and now nothing but blink blinky cursor and my dada all lost oh Im sad I hate suse so much.(then there is the problem of leveraging the freeware space into a profit stream, but I won't go there. Now, where was I? Oh yeah...)And it installed and my hair fell out so my wife ran off with the mailman and now Im covered with hives because of susse"
1,oh me oh my,"My troubles began when I put my install dvd inside. That should tell you all you need to know about SUSE. It took many hours before I discovered the dvd was upside down. Why doesnt it just tell me??? I know computers and I can make sure the black wire thing is plugged into the wall thing and so on. No such problems happen with my XP Home. Its smart enough to even be on my computer without me doing anything.So I pressed all of the ""OKs"" and suse booted and wants a password.I dont know any passwords!!Now Im stuck by this suse."
1,"System is hung, it has a green screen now!","All is lost now, my Windows is gone and I am unable to get it to go farther than a green screen. It gets hung and asks for Disk2 but I cannot get the disk out of the machine. So now the disk is stuck and no Windows booting up.Very upset with this, that green screen is all I get, now I have to have a pc repair man look at my computer."
1,Screen is freezing up?,"What now, my pc keeps going to a black screen and freezing all over the place. I have to keep rebooting it with the power button or pulling the powercord on it, then it wants to force a file system check? *** What is going on here, then it says missing dependency's all over the place. Also, why does it not have active x, websites will not work with it, then the web browser crashes with a 'segv' error? A couple of times, I have made it to the internet and tried to install some applications, it asked me to 'force' install I told it YES to do so. Then it started locking up on me, what is a dependency, what do I need them for? I already have 5 kids!Then it locked up again, it wanted to do a file system check, it hung during it so I yanked the powercord out of the wall!"
5,To address those issues,1. All Linux packages should be able to close X to reveal a CLI. However Slackware uses a CLI for nearly everything it does. SuSE has lots of windows type GUI for nearly everything it does. Linux users never really end up learning Linux with SuSE.2. The Kernel is what it is called. Slackware actually makes you learn kernel compiling if you want the latest kernel.3. Linux commands do not change across linux distros. It is all Linux. The problem is SuSE doesn't teach you any of it because it provides you with all the GUI you could want.I have used SuSE and think it is great if you want start using Linux but you certainly won't learn Linux. You learn SuSE.
1,Stinky!,"This balm claims to be chock-full of vitamins and nutrients and it sure as heck smells like that! Yuck! Have you ever opened a bottle of vitamin supplements and taken a whiff? Exactly as stinky as this balm is. (And not that semi-pleasant medicinal scent like menthol.) I was also thinking that this was a lip salve-ish product and since I peel and bite my lips, I thought this would smooth them out thus deterring me from my bad habit. In a word, no. My lips are still peeling and it stinks, literally, to apply this product. My advice? Stick to the cheapo over-the-counter brands!"
3,you can't walk with these on,"The foot warming function works pretty well - you microwave the booties for as long as you need to to get them hot, and then you put them on. Well, once you put them on, you better be in a place you want to stay in for a while given that you can't really walk with these on. I made my feet all nice and toasty while working at the computer and then had to run for the phone- I had to take them off (now my feet felt wayyy colder than before I put the booties on), get the phone, sit back down and put them on. A bit of a hassle for women ""on the go""."
1,burnt,"I thought this was a good purchase until I asked my husband to put one in the microwavefor me about 2:oo minutes and we started smelling something burning, it was the foot wrapreally upset with this."
3,What you would expect of an $80 headboard.,"For the price it is a finishing piece for an additional, not so often used bed; it looks alright once assembled which took me about an hour to do. It is what one would expect for paying the low price. The functionality of the item matches what you would need for a guest bedroom but the material wouldn't hold up for daily use I don't believe."
4,Functional,"We bought headboard and tall captain's bed. Wish they lined up better without the fuss. Was very easy and simple to assemble. We used glue around wooden dowel for a sturdier, longer lasting product. Really looks like wood, just much heavier being mdf. I think that we would have found this to be a better product if it was cheaper."
3,"Good looking, but has an issue","This headboard is good-looking and solidly built for a prepac piece of furniture. It was easy to put together, as well. However, there is one unforeseen issue: there is a gap between the Monterey bed and the headboad of about 2.5 inches--just enough for small or thin objects to fall between them. Once an object has fallen, it is very difficult to retrieve it without removing the headboard. I have had some luck using a piece of gum on a stick-like object, but this won't work for heavier things. I'm a klutz--we've had this headboard for 2 months, and there is already quite a collection of small objects under it."
2,"What a waste of resource, money and time!","I do not claim to be a do-it-yourself specialist, but I have built a lot of do-it-yourself things before; with many confusing parts. However, I cannot believe how bad the instructions were on this one. I followed them word-for-word but I had to rip the whole thing apart and do it again. of course that ruined everything making the product now unusable; I even tried to hold the pieces together with tape, but it wouldn't work. It's only trash. My money has been wasted. I remember I was very impressed with the quality of the materials, but because of the instructions being horrible it all went to waste; I can't even return it of course because I have already assembled it and the product was broken during my (re)assembly.Well, I just hope the seller takes my feedback seriously and improves the instructions; I have never had such a bad experience with Amazon."
1,Mormon Pity-Pot Women Speak,"I bought this book when it was in hard-back. I was hoping it would yeild insights into Latter-day Saint women's issues. Instead, it turned out to be a page-by-page pity party of Mormon ""liberal"" females. After a bit of time wading through the narratives, one gets weary reading how these ladies try to flatter themselves, riding on the mindset that they are the enlightened elite--troddened down in the male-dominatated world of the Latter-day Saints. Stylized self-pity. Often they seem to get lost in their own wordplay while trying to frame some kind of argument to justify their own persecution fantasies. A waste of time and money--even in paperback."
5,Spellbinding,"Whether you are a hardcore rational materialist or the flower-power type, Terence McKenna will enchant you for sure.Anyway you look at True Hallucinations (adventure, intellectual sci-fi or the very tomb of Western science and pinnacle of Western Philosophy... which turns out is not Western at all in the case of the psychedelic experience) this work will change the way you look at everything. Because, well, this is a book about everything - i.e. the essence of our perceptions and experiences as sapient entities.The experience at La Chorera is the culmination of the meeting with the profound ""other"" to be continued in his next book ""The Invisible Landscape"", which is the ultimate death-blow to Western scientific thought.McKenna is an ethnobotanyst, anthropologist, historian and science philosopher of his own magnitude.Read all his books but start with ""True Hallucinations""."
1,Smithsonian should know better,"The name Guaymi is not a native american word, but a name imposed by invaders on the Ngäbe People. It is un-scientific for the Smithsonian to be so aloof from its own racist slurs that earn Black List attention with Instituto Uraba. Our new web site shall let you know."
4,Good Information,"This book adequatley describes the less than humane conditions of Panamanian Indians, especially the Guaymi. It does not ahave a lot about their culture or history, which is what I was more interested in."
4,Not quite as outstanding as I first thought,"Having worked my way through most of this book I have to downgrade it to 4 stars. There are a number of frustrating bugs which slow down development. Rather than just list the bugs and supply fixes, the author Jerke tells visitors to trawl through the various discussions on his web site - not helpful. Don't look for explanations on how to create SQL databases, DSNs etc. because there aren't any. It is still a good book, but not for beginners."
3,Helpful to get started,"At the time I was presented this book I could build some nice websites with HTML, but had no real ASP experience. The title is misleading as there is very little Visual Basic information inside. What there is however, is a functional sample store on the included CD, along with explanations of most of the code. You get the SQL Server database, and all the ASP files. I ended up building a very nice e-commerce site by modifying and building upon the existing sample store. This in itself made the book worthwhile. This book is best suited for someone who has some ASP and some SQL Server knowlege already - and needs to build a modest e-commerce site. It will get you started in the right direction. It will not help you learn Visual Basic."
2,Needed more time at the Editor's Desk,"I have to start by saying that I agree with most of the revies I have seen on this book here: It's a good reference to Microsoft products. However, I feel that there is something else that must be addressed: the gross amount of errors in the code itself. There are variables that are dimentioned only to not be used in some of the actual pages (chrFax). This book is meant for an Intermediate user, so for those readers that expect to open the book and be on your way to making shopping carts be careful, the author assumes a lot out of you. May seem like minor quibbles, but I'm only up to Chapter 9 and the errors are almost too much to deal with."
3,Good in starting but then loses it's touch after 3-4 chapter,Good enough to learn the basics of ASP and E-Commerce.
4,Good for begginers.,"You can't expect to learn all of E-Commerce and everything about ASP from one book. OK? I liked the book's approach and is very suitable for begginers. I did not like the fact that the author printed all of the source code in the book itself, even though everything is on CD-Rom, wasting many pages. What is valuable is the author's approach to E-Commerce Solutions and the algorithm for solving numerous programming problems."
3,Just another book out there.,"The book is excellent at presenting all the required tools to build an online store. It give you an overview and key features of each tools - But it doesn't tell you very much as how to use such tools. Don't expect to learn ASP or SQL here if you are new to ASP and SQL. There are lots of ASP codes and SQL queries in this book - just no explanation. I find that the online store sample in the book too simple, Hardly complex enough to for reader to learn new techniques (if user level is Intermediate/Advanced). In general, too much reading for a small amount of new information. Deserves 3 stars for excellent overview of each tools and good layout of the Table of Content (the indexing is also good)."
4,Actually a supportive tank!,"I've always had big boobs and could never wear tanks with built in bras without another bra. Since having a baby, I'm now a G cup. Not only do they make them big enough to fit, but they actually support me!!! One thing to note though: if you buy the white one, you can see your nursing pads through it."
3,"Good quality, hard to use","I was impressed with the quality of the tank top, felt heavy and sturdy with great support, but when it came to nursing in it, I was shocked! It was nearly impossible to get it open with one hand, and when you have a squirming, hungry baby in your lap, you definitely need a tank you can manipulate one-handed. I like my ones from Target better, and they were half the price."
2,Not ideal,"I really like the ruching detail and the reviews seemed so great I bought this in white despite the price. I'm dissapointed in the thickness of the fabric. I wouldn't be able to wear this alone because either my nipples or the nursing pads would be plainly visible, at least their shape. I imagine the same would be true for other colors. Also, there was a strange fit with extra fabric around the nipple area so that it pooched out a little there even when wearing the nursing pads which should've negated any impact of my still relatively small nursing size (34C). I ended up returning it because there are other camis that are half the price but definitely more wearable, like the undercover mama camis."
3,"It's good, but it could be better","I love the way this tank feels. I feel supported and it is a flattering shape. I ordered white and was disappointed that you could see my nursing pads through the fabric, so I won't be wearing it by itself. That said, it will be a great to wear under t-shirts etc."
2,"Great look, odd fit","I bought this top because it is much cuter than most of the nursing tanks out there. I thought it would be worth the $40+. After receiving the tank I'm not particularly satisfied, but I am keeping the top. The inside of the built in nursing bra isn't like that of a regular nursing bra. There is one strap that holds up the top while you're nursing and it sits strangely on top of your nipple, so it isn't very comfortable. Also, the material is pretty stiff and not very stretchy. It does appear to be very well made and will probably last a while if I can get past the uncomfortable strap and stiff fabric."
1,Disappointed!!!,I was expected to buy a new nursing bra but got a bra with dirty fat spots on it...very disappointed!!!
2,terrible shape in the bust and very short straps,"I'm 34DD or larger now that I'm nursing, and bought this tank because the cheap Target ones weren't supportive enough. This tank is very tight but bulges strangely in the nipple area. It's also very low cut and the straps seem really short. Luckily I'm only 5'4"". I don't think this would fit a taller person."
2,Warning - LOTS OF CLEAVAGE!,"I bought this tank on a friend's recommendation. The fabric and general fit was good, but it revealed considerable cleavage. Way too low cut for me. If you're comfortable with that, would probably be a good tank. If you don't want to show lots of cleavage, look elsewear. I ended up buying a Gilligan & O'Malley side-sling nursing tank from Target and am very pleased with it (for 1/3 of the price)."
2,Not worth the money,"I have a few of the Gilligan and O'Malley nursing tank tops from Target, but was trying to find one that I could wear alone and provided more support. This top is not worth the money. I like it just as much as the Target ones, but they are around $15. I thought the built in bra would be thicker and I would be able to wear it alone, but I can't. It is an okay tank top, but I just don't think it is worth $50. Also, I haven't washed it yet, but it doesn't really look like it is going to hold up too well in the wash."
3,Good but not good enough for price,"This top is good. I hesitated to buy it for a while. Within 30 minutes of wearing it my baby had a poop-splosion and I got it dirty. I think I would need at least 3 of these tops to last me a couple of days in between loads of laundry - but at $150?? No way. Also, it's not as attractive as I had hoped. I overlooked the detail in the middle, but I couldn't tell from the picture that there is also a line under the breast area. I'm a small girl and I hate that my cup size got so large while nursing, so I'd prefer not to bring more attention to it with all these details around my breasts."
3,CANNOT WEAR ALONE,I bought this tank hoping to wear it alone and under other shirts/dresses....however the BIG plastic clips on the straps and the shiny trim around the edges just makes it scream BRA!!! I wore it under a shirt hoping it would look like a tank and my mom kept telling me my bra was showing!! It fits great and is super comfy but doesn't really fit the bill I was hoping it would. Also the clips take a bit of getting used to and are hard to do with one hand!! But at least the strap doesn't go flying down and get lost like other nursing tanks since it stays connected on the side. (MUCH nice product than Glamourmom tanks!)
5,Best cami ever!!!,"I was looking all over for a nursing cami that would be nice and comfy and supportive. These cami's are very well made, very comfortable and not super thin like the cheaply made ones you'll find at target or motherhood (the ones at motherhood the snaps would come undone all the time without me doing anything, it was really annoying). Highly recommend these! now if they'd just make them so that the straps could be converted to a halter and/or racer back then they would be perfect!!!"
4,Awesome nursing/maternity tank!,"The Bravado! essential nursing tank has great support! I plan to buy another one I love it so much. I am a size double ""D"" normally and to find something without an underwire that fits and supports incredibly well I am very pleased. I also like the tank because its long and covers my entire prego belly, also when I nurse I will still be covered up if I have to lift my outer shirt. The fabric is thick and strong. I only docked one star because of price and sizing. This tank fits me well now, but when my milk comes in I'm afraid it might be too snug. I wish I bought one size up. I also wish the price was between $30 - $40. Buying something I will only wear for half a year is hard enough and then having to spend close to $50 on one undergarment seems extreme to me. Overall super product, i'd buy again!"
4,"Really durable and secure nursing bras, hard to open one-handed","I got through having first baby with just a white and a black Bravado nursing bra tank. Now that I am pregnant with baby number two, I just bought 3 more in other colors and I STILL wear the first 2! The one draw back of this tank has actually turned out to be helpful: the clasps on the front for nursing are nearly impossible to open with one hand, but it is possible to close it one handed. So you have to unclasp on your way to get the baby. BUT other nursing bras with easier to open clasps, feel less secure and sometimes click open on their own. So the security and support, even after many many wearings and washings, is worth it."
3,"A nice tank, with some caveats!","I have been wearing this tank for a year now. It is important to realize that this tank is pretty form fitting. This is perfect now that I have lost most of the baby weight, but initially it was too form fitting to wear without another shirt on top. This is true, even though I bought a large cup size. I am 5'7 and normal build. If you are a larger girl in the waist area, I would not recommend it. That said, the fabric is really thick and soft, so it conceals nicely and it is very convinient for nursing."
3,good fit,"I ordered the black one ,the new one is better. fits good very easy for nursing, washes well and keeps its shape."
3,Fits weird,"This top fits tighter than described. I bought my accurate size and it was wearable, but too tight to be comfortable for everyday wear. I returned it."
4,good purchase,I was happy to find this at a better price than in the store. Good support. Not great. But worth it. Convenient.
3,"great shirt, bad sizing","I love the tank, it's got great straps that unclip and it works wonderfully for nursing. The size chart, in my opinion, is way off though and this shirt ended up being much smaller than what I needed. Also, as you can see in the photo, it's fairly low cut. It's still one of the best options on the market though."
2,Cannot clip/unclip with one hand,"This is a durable tank and provides a lot of support, but I dislike two things about it:1. Unlike my other nursing tanks, I cannot clasp/unclasp it with one hand. This is VERY inconvenient, as anyone who's ever nursed a baby in public knows.2. It's rather low-cut. If I wanted a bra, I would have purchased a bra. What I wanted was a shirt-bra combo, which is what I have with my other nursing tops. I could never wear this top by itself (without a shirt or sweater covering it.So, even though this top is pretty high quality in terms of the materials and construction, it doesn't function as needed. On top of this, it costs about twice what my other nursing tops cost."
2,Wayyy to short,"This was like a crop top on me. Width was ok but length was way short so no use in going up a size. I am not particularly tall, 5'8 so I was surprised by how short it was."
3,Sizing is off,I ended up returning this because although I followed the sizing chart it was too small. I ended up finding a similar product by Bravado at my local Target for $25 that I love.
4,Best nursing tank!,"This tank is so much more supportive than others I have! It's nice and thick, too. It's also long enough to give good stonach coverage, which is a must for post partun stomachs, in my opinion! The hooks are a little tricky at first but fine once I got the hang of them.My only complaint is that I wish I could wear just this under a cardigan, but it's too low for that. I'm an E cup so smaller chested ladies might be okay to wear alone!"
3,Not what I thought it was,"I ended up returning this nursing tank. I thought it would be similar to the basics by bravado sold at target, but it's not. Also, not a full support bra, only fabric lining like most tanks sold out there."
4,Great As Sleepwear,"I'm a 34J/K and bought the 34F/G Bravado tank at the same time as the GlamourMom tank, and I use them both for sleeping. I find that they're actually more supportive than sleep bras, which seem to be designed for smaller-chested girls. While both brands of tanks serve their purpose (boobs actually stay in place and covered when I'm sleeping on my side), I much prefer the Bravado, because there is no under-layer fabric to cause the nursing pad to shift or bunch. I'm a total cheapskate, so I really resent paying $40+ for a cotton tank, but they're so worth it to me that I've just bought 3 more."
1,Not good for large busts,"I bought the F/G cup size. For three times the price of the Gillian O'Malley tanks the Bravado offers only a fraction more support which may be enough for around the house but definitely never for wearing out, the hooks are much harder to use (cannot use one handed), the shelf bra offers an old school pointed shape that is unattractive, the material is thicker, hotter and harder to get on and the lower part of the shirt is not flowy it is tight and shows all your post partum tummy bulges. I am returning this tank."
4,Tight but excellent,"Well made, soft fabric, but a tight fit. My cup size at 39 weeks pregnant is 40D. I purchased size 40 F/G, and was surprised to find it was still tight around the bust. It was a good experiment, but my Gilligan & O'Malley nursing tank in XXL fits perfectly and is also well crafted for less price."
4,good quality but too low cut,"I definitely think it is worthwhile to spend the money on some nice nursing wear, especially if you plan/hope to nurse your baby for anything longer than a few months. I bought one of these tanks for my first child and two for the second and they are great for hiding my belly when nursing in public. They are sturdy, well-made and carefully sewn and therefore wash well. I wish they were a little bit less low-cut as they reveal too much to be worn on their own for anything but a yoga class (for my taste). Also they are expensive and if you have issues with milk leaking be warned- they can get mildew spots!!! Yuck!!! Be sure to hang tanks on the edge of your hamper to let them dry between washings. I am throwing out the two mildewy ones and have ordered two more, but am starting to feel as though I have just spent too much money on these tanks!"
3,"Lots of bubbles, but goes VERY fast!!","This machine is really good as far as making bubbles very quickly, but the solution does not last long at all. The first time we used the gazillion bubble machine (16oz bottle of gazillion bubbles) it only lasted 5 minutes. It was very fun for that 5 minutes though =) The bubble solution cost too much money to have to buy so much of it."
5,Makes lots of bubbles!,This is a great toy for outdoors. It really makes a lot of bubbles. If you use it inside the floors get slippery and then you have the mess of clean up. Really recommend it for outside use. My Grandaughter Madelyn loves it! Can't wait til Spring!!
4,Gazillion Bubble Solution,"I have no complaints about this. We bought it to use in a bubble machine for our daughter's first birthday party and it worked great! The solution is thick enough to use in a bubble machine, and because of that the bubbles also last a split second longer when they land. They're good, quality bubbles in my opinion."
4,Great value,This is the only kind of bubble product to use with the Gazillion bubble makers. Makes lots of bubbles and is a great value.
1,"Way overpriced, buy local","Good bubble soluton, but way overpriced on Amazon; buy at your local retailer for less than half the price."
1,Great Product But SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED HERE!,"This is a great product and your kids will have tons of fun blowing bubbles BUT do not buy this!I am preparing for my daughters birthday and shopping on amazon as I always do. I decided to get some bubbles for the kids to play with and bought this bottle at just over $[...]. Last night I went to a discount store (won't say any specific names but it's a national chain with super low prices :) ) And I realized I should have shopped around before adding the bubbles to my cart. For 100 oz of bubbles I only paid $[...]!! That is right, $[...] for more than what you get here. So it's a great product but seriously overpriced. Don't make the same mistake I did, shop around and check your local discount store before buying here."
3,Leaked in the package,"I mean its bubble soap right, im sure it performs to spec. Shipping however was not good. A considerable amount leaked into the box and if much more had the box would have fallen apart. So I don't think I got my advertised 64 oz."
5,Excellent Resource,This compilation of papers presented by world experts in the field of post-abortion ministry is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to understand the wounds of abortion and their resolution.
3,A little ancient history,"A lot has changed on the Internet in decade or so since this book was published. It describes the domain name system, SMTP email, Usenet, Telnet and FTP. No mention of the World Wide Web, which was just getting off the ground when this book was published. The book seems quaint now, though much of the information still applies. Read about ""the"" Internet worm, the Cuckoo's egg and the online Coke machine!"
2,Weak polarization effect,"We purchased the filter for use on a 28-300 mm Tamron lens. We're very disappointed in the polarization - there is very little discernible difference as the filter is turned. Also, it messes up the focusing, making everything ""soft-focused"", particularly in telephoto ranges."
3,Good story...Bad language,"I agree with most of the positive reviews this book has received, however I feel the need to make parents, librarians, and teachers aware that the book contains a few four-letter words and some slang, which would be considered inappropriate for this grade level in most circles. This is an AR book with a reading level of 5.1 (5th grade). I understand that the language is used to make the story as real-life as possible. In that case, the book should be considered at a higher level due to content."
4,Good coming of age story,"Good southern coming-of-age book for middle school boys. The characters occasionally seemed a little mature for their ages, but likeable none-the-less. I don't know why the mother always has to die in boys' coming of age stories, but it does seem to be an over-riding theme including this book. Ah well. A custody battle, although not bad, between (Tobin's) the main character's father and grandmother is a central theme as well as raising chickens and whether or not chickens have souls and friendship and identity. Oddly it all ties together and works. I enjoyed this one and will recommend it to boys and some girls age 9-12."
2,Doesn't hold it's shape,"We've owned this attractively decorated (yes, I'll give it that) dog bed for about 9 months. After about a month, it had already lost it's shape. The bolster in the back slumps forward, which basically makes it look funny, and more importantly it doesn't function very well anymore. The ""sleeping"" area was reduced so dramatically, that we just started putting blanket over the top, so our dog could still use it. At first, I put a folded up dog blanket in the center area, which allowed her to sleep on that at the height of the flopped over back bolster, but eventually it was so flopped down, that the bed is practically flat. I regret buying this rather expensive dog bed, for such terrible performance."
4,"""Great Fun!"" -Straight from the Source",As an employee of the company that made this game I am inclined to lie to you and say that this game is the greatest game in the world. I'm not going do that. But this game is great fun for children ages 9 or less and is a really easy game to play. In Land Before Time I was really impressed with the entertainment and the quality gameplay I received even though the game is meant for children. The game possesses cartoon graphics and cute vocal interactions between characters. The levels are well thought out and the game is truly fun to play. The control could be a bit more fluid but the game is still very enjoyable. If you are looking for a game that your children will enjoy and that isn't full of blood and violence buy this game.
1,Too hard; suboptimal graphics,"We purchased this game for our 4 year old and found the game to be too difficult. Not that the tasks were difficult but performing them were. As an adult, we couldn't get passed the first level. We also found the graphics to be weak and resemble early computer games."
2,Not worth the investment,"I've had a set of two of these for years, used to make salad dressing. One cracked in the bottom very soon after purchase. Other is hanging in but I can see stress cracks. I tried a Ball canning jar on my Oster (2.5 or 2 5/8 mouth) and it fits. Canning jars come in at least 2 sizes that I know of. Don't see a reason to buy the brittle plastic jars any more--not to mention who wants to store in plastic anymore and glass is better in the dishwasher. Oh, I got the idea to check the fit while culling old appliance booklets--I had a Cuisinart booklet specifically with Ball jar recipes--baby food, bread/cookie crumbs, spice/blends, vegies, sauces, dressing, ""blendered"" hard cheese, salsa, coctails, tapenade. Worth checking your blender if you have a canning jar on hand."
1,Do not buy this,Please do not spend money on this product.It said it will fit my Oster base but it does not !I am using the jar to water my plants now !
2,Jar crack in two uses,"after my second use of the jar, i had filled water in it to clean and later noted that the water had seeped outside. On thorough visual inspection, found that the joint where the base is stuck to the sides, there is a gap through which water was seeping. hard to believe this is not extrusion molded in a single piece, rather the sides and base is fused together.i shall get it exchanged to see if it is an issue with just the piece that i got or is it universal."
1,"It fits, but...","I wanted a couple of extra containers so I could make something ahead and store it. The two jars I received appeared to be fine, though they were a little lightweight, had a ""blu-ish"" cast and a solid handle. I also noticed they weren't branded. I used the new plastic jars on the Oster blender and within two weeks both had fractures in the plastic and one broke in half. They were used for pureeing chicken with chicken broth so I don't think they were being over worked. I threw them out and ordered glass mini jars that I'm very happy with. For me, these plastic mini jars were a waste of money."
3,Pretty good,"This item would be perfect if it was made of glass. It works well, no problems but is icky plastic."
4,value for money,"nice accessory to have. made of plastic, but not flimsy at all. wish this was available in a store near by (the shipping cost is close to the product cost)."
3,Could be better,"The mini jar is reasonably functional in that it enables one to blend small quantities. However, the upside down orientation means that if you need to add a tad more water or one additional ingredient, you need to unscrew --> remove the blade assembly --> add the stuff --> screw in the blade assembly again. All in all a clumsy process, especially considering that a little bit of the liquid inside is sure to spill out while unscrewingThere are no real alternatives in this size range of jar however."
1,Very bad product - DO NOT BUY,"Oster once used to make good products - probably they were made in USA before. I purchased this mini jar recently and within a week of purchase and with very careful handling, it broke. The plastic used was of very cheap quality - probably it was made in China. Will never buy anything in future which is made by Oster. Another product is Corelle cookware - their dishes now have started breaking quite often - this was not the case earlier. Seems like consumers have to pay a big price since companies like Oster and Corelle have shifted bases to China."
1,Worthless,this is so tiny it is useless - i used it once and ended up with beans all over my kitchen
1,Bowling Bag Blunder,this is very cheaply made. I had mine for about 3 months and the zippers got off track cannot keep the ball in the bag without the zippers... the handle is cheap and bent from trying to take the bag dow the steps...I would not recommend this bag....you get what you pay for.
5,Leg Guards,A very durable product for older kids and fathers who like to umpire and catch for their kids. Both my son and daughter pitch for their teams and if your daughter plays fast pitch softball you may want these guards to catch drop ball pitches. These definetly saved my legs from extreme abuse.
1,Really crappy glue gun!,Don't waste your money - it'll cost you more in gas to return it than it's worth. Picked mine up from Lowes. Figured I'd put this out there.The one I got was the mt300 (orange and gray though). The trigger didn't work well with only tiny beads and a small string of glue coming out of the nozzleon each trigger pull. It didn't grab the glue sticks well and made many tiny notches in it before it would feed. So to temporarily use it I had to push the glue in manually -but the barrel gets extremely hot so it was really not fun.I hate this glue gun.
1,Crashed both my computers!!!,"When I saw this item for sale, I must have been one of the first to buy it. Seems great in concept, especially if you use hot spots for internet access. I use two different laptops, one for work and one for personal use. One has windows XP Pro, the other just XP. When I plugged the kensington firewall into my USB the first computer, the system recognized that a new piece of hardware was installed and then froze up for a few seconds before the blue screen came up and the system crashed. On the second attempt on my other computer it happened even quicker ( within 3 seconds of plugging it in ). Thankfully I was able to restart both of them and no apparent damage was caused. I have NEVER had anything like this happen with any other device I have ever plugged into my computer. Be very careful before you use this GIZMO!!!"
1,Kensington USB (You'll Suffer Baby) Firewall,"Since ""zero"" is not an option, I had to settle for ""one"". Avoid this device at all cost. It crashed my XP Media Edition OS, and rendered my laptop unusable. Not even Safe Mode or Last Known Good would work. And I agree with the earlier reviewer regarding Kensinton's support... they offered no assistance, and instead refered me to India (I mean Dell). Dell said the diagnostic showed corrupted clusters and that my hard drive was crashed. So they shipped me a refurb replacement, and I had the joyous task of reinstalling my entire software base. Lessons learned... backup frequently and avoid Kensington products."
2,"One worked, the other was blank","Bought 2, one for personal use, one for gift to colleague. Fortunately the gift did work, but the one for personal use was empty (no protection software, so functions only as memory stick). When contacted, Kensington replied no longer supporting product and recommended against using because it can 'corrupt' your data, etc. I had used another one for a long time and no problem with Windows XP, wanted another one for our new laptop."
3,Not for Windows 98 users,"I am extremely happy with the quality of this product, the sound is incredible and th controls are very intuitive. The product itself receives 5 stars but the deceptive advetising receives none. The box and other websites say that the software is compatible with Windows 98SE however, the software will actually only ru with Windows XP. If you are an XP user or you can dix the problem bt rigging a solution like I did, you will be thrilled. The prodict is wonderful, just don't be conned by the box."
2,creative zen,bought this for my daughter last year. She has had nothing but trouble with it. It was already sent back and fixed and still does not work right. Now the warranty is not valid so she is stuck with it.
1,I got a lemon,"Less than 2 months after purchase the buttons stopped working, and the manufacturer was difficult to deal with. No useful support or responsibility. Amazon, which is where I purchased, gave me an 80% refund. Disappointing."
3,Windows XP only.,"Well, I can't really write a review for this... as I never got to use it when I bought it. Alot of sites say this works with Windows 2000, but it's XP only. I sadly had to return it the day after I bought it."
3,Dust inside the player,"The quality of this MP3 lives up to the word on the street, but it started collecting dust behind the view panel since I first opened the package. One month into it, it is getting harder event to see the songs as they appear on the display."
2,Decent MP3 Player until..................,Until it begins freezing up. I bought mine when it came out and the unit worked fine for 2 months then froze once in mid song and once during song selection. Once it freezes you have 2 choices pray it unfreezes or wait until the battery drains. Read the reviews by Dallasite & E. Lee. Same thing happened to me I contacted Creative and followed their instructions the reboot seems to help temporarly and the firmware update makes the player unresponsive. This was a good MP3 player but it seems everyone has the same problem with it.
1,Not worth the trouble,"If you are planning on buying an MP3 player do yourself a favor and go with a well known brand like i-pod (it's worth the extra expense). I got the creative zen leek MP3 and tried to use it right away. It came loaded with 2 songs and after I listened to the first one it got stuck. It froze on me and didn't want to turn off, or do anything else. After several hours of trying I finally could turn it off. By then it was really hot. I never even have the chance to download my own songs. I returned it right away and I am waiting for my refund."
1,"Breaks easily, bad interface, terrible warranty","My Sleek stopped working correctly after sustaining one fall from waist height. Now, sound only comes out of the right side speaker, which is infuriating, and leads to a product that brings more rage than joy. Furthermore, attempting to get anything done with the warranty requires jumping through a few hundred hoops, paying fees, and (oh yeah) you must keep your receipt. Forever. Also, this machine has a TERRIBLE computer program for loading songs onto it etc. It was an absolute exercise in frustration just to get them on there, only to have it break six months in after one fall from waist height. I thought I would be enlightened and get an iPod competitor for a lower price and with neat-looking features. My next MP3 will certainly be an iPod."
1,Does NOT work with WINDOWS 2000,"In case you've come across info about this product that says it works with Windows 2000...don't learn the hard way, like I did.The product is only supported by XP or higher...if you have Windows 2000, it will NOT work (Unless you are using Windows 2000 in Asia, according to Deepak, the Creative media support fellow.)So I bought this, and tried to install it, and no go... have to send it back.Be careful -- the box says it works with Windows 2000, but some of the boxes apparently now hav ea label stuck over that info to ""cancel"" it out. But the installation instructions still refer to Windows 2000, even though it doesn't work on that platform...Off to buy an I-POD..."
1,Do NOT BUY this mp3 player,"I have been searching for the proper mp3 player for quite some time. Over the internet I was obsessing over the Zen Sleek for roughly 2 weeks. Finally I went to BestBuy, and got a first-hand look at the Zen Sleek. It was a huge disappointment; the backlight is too blue and makes it hard to see under light, the verticle touch pad is far to sensitive, and the overall player is too thick. Going from start-menu to options to now playing is difficult, and controlling the volume is no-where near as easy as the iPod. I would never reccomend this to anyone and strongly hope you do not either."
5,LOVE IT,Everyone always loves it when my son wears this shirt. It is adorable and he gets lots of compliments.
5,"Fun, Informative and Convenient","As a second time parent, I found this video complete and informative. The information was presented in a humorous and entertaining manor. With my first pregnancy I attended a class at the hospital, it nearly put me to sleep. Sherry was fantastic and I enjoyed her wit, she made learning a joy. I learned so much more from her class then I did the one I took at the hospital. As a teacher myself, I can say, she is one of the best teachers I have observed teach almost any subject. I would highly recommend this video, even if you have already taken a class. If not this one is all you need. We loved being able to take this class at home. With both of us working, we found if difficult to find time to attend a class or find a baby sitter for our two year old. This was perfect, THANK YOU Sherry."
1,As a last resort only....,"We bought this tape instead of attending classes and were very disappointed with it. Not only was the picture and sound quality poor, but the instructor was very annoying. The only good point about this video was that it explained basic info if you knew absolutely nothing about how the birth process progresses, as well as pain management. It did not, however, explain in any type of detail the breathing exercises and when to do them, which is why we bought the video! There was only a brief discussion about massage and the very quick instruction on basic breathing techniques. I was not able to use them at all during the birth of my daughter for simple lack of not knowing them! We were not happy with this video and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Barely worth it,"I bought this tape in lieu of attending a childbirth class. I felt that it did educate me regarding what to expect during labor and birth. However, the tape was extremely poor quality (both video and audio)and the instructor was irritating at best! They kept referring to a ""workbook"" which was not included in my mailing, and often there were charts and pictures shown to the class that were not visible to me. The instructor's style was very bossy and arrogant, and it was tiring to watch due to the poor camera work. I can't say I regret buying the tape because it provided me with necessary information and ideas; however, I think it should be a better quality tape for the amount they charge."
1,Birthing for Dummies,"While there is a lot of information in this video, the presentation is awful. The production and organization are shoddy and there are no useful demonstrations or clips of real-world situations. Spending the same amount of time with any book on the subject would provide several times more information. (The tape refers frequently to a workbook which is not included with the tape, making it even more useless.) The presenter is annoying, preachy, and poorly spoken. The video appears to be aimed at people who have never been near bodily fluids, much less a maternity ward."
3,"Helpful info - but no ""live birth experience"" clips","I agree with Heidi's review. The information was very helpful and worth investing in (we don't begin our ""live"" childbirth classes until next month and I was curious...), but her voice can be annoying, as is her general style after a while. I also appreciated the materials, even if somewhat scarce. In reading reviews on other videos, there doesn't seem to be much in terms of videos of actual births, which would have been a nice addition to this video. Anyone have recommendations for that aspect?"
3,Informative but poor quality,"The quality of the video was very poor. The instructor`s voice-overs were at times hard to understand, and she spoke too quickly. Most of the time the viewer is unable to see her posters and other materials."
1,Pretty bad.,"This is what I didn't like:1. The sound was all messed up on my copy. 2. The instructor speaks so poorly that her grammar and sentence organization become distractions. Errors along the lines of, ""Don't drink orange juice in labor because its too acidityic."" 3. The instructor is just plain unappealing - I really didn't need to see her sitting on a chair aping having a bowel movement. 4. There's nothing in this video that you can't get from reading a more thorough, less expensive book. 5. The instructor references a workbook that is not included. 6. The instructor uses posters as visual aids, but you can't really see the posters in the video.If you really, really hate to read you wil probably get something out of this video, but if you have done any reading on childbirth you can safely skip this video. There's nothing about the visual presentation in this video that will add to your knowledge."
1,Disappointment!,"After examining all the information currently available on Lamaze, this video is very outdated and inaccurate! They were correct about some of the procedures, but please do your research prior to deciding to spend money here."
3,Bedrest Rescue,"4 days before our classes were to begin, I was put on bedrest. Being our first child we needed as much information as possible. This video helped us a lot. It was informative and entertaining. The quality of the tape was not very impressive-the sound was not matched up with the picture in several places and the tracking gave us some problems."
4,An intensive exploration.,"This book is short, only 48 pages, but is packed with an incredible amount of information and art. Zeri has done a phenomenal job of encapsulating Munch's life and work in a single, easily digestible package, one from which admirers of ""The Scream"" and art enthusiasts in general can learn a great deal. I would love to explore other books in Zeri's series."
4,Well done madcap comedy,"Very much in the spirit of the better Hollywood madcap comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. If you are looking for a lively and entertaining farce, this film is probably worthy of five stars, but it loses one star because of a crucial mistranslation in the subtitles, which made numerous references to a 'drowsy.' I would have enjoyed the film more if I hadn't been so distracted by trying to figure out what a 'drowsy' was (near the end I finally realized that the intended word probably was 'dowry'). Otherwise, this film is an excellent choice for some very well done silliness."
2,Active users should avoid this,"Despite the advertising, this ipod (and the 10 gb model, judging by posts elsewhere), is not suitable for active people. The music is stored on a hard drive, which functions only when it is still. To get around this, the unit has a ""skip protection"" memory buffer advertised to last 25 minutes. The buffer works for only 17 minutes, then the unit locks up and must be rebooted. Mine wouldn't reboot for a long time-- until long after I had finished my workout! Unless you need huge storage capacity, stick with a flash memory mp3 player or casette tapes."
1,less then 3 months and the product is not working,"I accidently clicked the buy-in-1click button,it was set on by default in my Amazon account. Icouldn't take a look at the product thoroughly.and purchase the product from amazon market placelong thing shorti purchased the product from amazon market place for 265 dollarsless then 3 months back (the Product was a warranty replacements from HP thats why i got the product for 265 dollars from amazon market place i was told the product is good )and the product is not working now... .... hardy after 2.5 months of purchasing the product"
4,installwizard shield,"i know i will love this but as my new ipod + hp was charging, i rounded up all my cd's sorted them, read the manual front to back and sat down to download the software and get started. i cannot get the darn software installed. i keep getting thed 1607 error report and even after following every idea given, i am still without music.it shouldn't be this hard"
1,Not a good clone,"This is totally a rebranded Apple iPod under the uglier skin. People had hoped for HP adding WMA support, but there is none in this. If you want an iPod, get the real thing. If you want a really good MP3 jukebox, check out the Creative Zen Touch. HP has very poor tech support, by the way, so the ten bucks you save over the iPod doesn't make this a better value."
1,Terrible product - warranty is worthless,"I bought one of these POS 40 gig HP - MP103. It was DOA. The Seller replaced it. The 2nd one was always buggy and crashed within 60 days. I spent 60 minutes on the phone with India. Only the run around. The HP internet ""care center"" it should be more like the HP ""screw the customer center"" does not even recognize the part number, so you can not get internet support. Oh yes, they no longer offer phone support for their Ipods...click. Waste of time, waste of money. I'd suggest never buying ANY product from HP"
1,Product may be great -- STAY AWAY OF HP SERVICE!!,"Hi,I got my IPOD @ COMPUSA before I headed off for Europe for 6 months -- BIG MISTAKE! I tried to get connect my unit to my Win XP laptop and ended up getting an error message on the screen. I called HP Tech Support who not only had no clue what the error message meant (the unit displayed a folder with an exclamation mark on it), but they also had no process in place to help if I was calling from outside the US. I will end up having to send the unit back to the US and pay for it (!!!) and they'll then send it back to my parents only so that I'll have to pay to get it shipped back again! SO STAY AWAY OF HP SERVICE, wherever you are...."
5,Fun to play again,"Fun to play again, but don't look for cutting edge. It's kind of like watching an old black and white movie. You have to put yourself in the day. Then it is great."
2,I wanted/expected to love this movie...,"I didn't enjoy this film. I love the cast. I love the concept. The trailers were amazing, unfortunately they showed some of the best parts. I didn't laugh once in this film. Instead I found myself bored, and cringing. I don't think I'd ever watch this film again... and I honestly can't even recommend it, which is rare for movies."
4,Better Than Expected,"The subject of swinging or swapping seems to have been covered by a dozen other comedies (unseen by me.) Mandy Moore is the only reason I watched this and she is terrific as usual. The supporting cast are adequate and the end is not what you might suppose. It stays on a mostly tasteful and tactful approach, considering the very adult subject matter. It would even work as a ""date movie."""
2,Skip the story -- the paintings are everything.,"There really isn't much to say about this picture book. Yes, the paintings are wonderful and if you love Allsburg's art work, then by all means get the book. But the story, such as it is, is incredibly lame. One can only hope this will not be made into a 100+ million dollar movie. The only emotion you are likely to feel at the end of the book is: ""So what."""
5,"read this book called, the wreck of the zephyr!!",hey hey all you book lovers!! come sit down and read this book called: the wreck of the zephyr!! it's a great book. this story is about an old man that tells the story of a sialboat called the zephyr. a zephyr is a light wind or breeze. the man tells the story to a young boy. the boat is all the way up on a cliff. faaaar from the water's edge. the boy wonders why and the man tells the story. read this book. its got GREAT pictures and is a great book. i'm sure you'll like it!!
4,If youj've ever heard them breathing in the boatyard in December...,"The tale might be a little trite, but if you've ever sailed a wooden boat on a fall afternoon or listened to one when the breeze catches the winter cover while she sits on the hard in December... you'd swear it was alive. And Van Allsberg catches this here. His other tales might be be more universal -- this one's for the imagination that's just a little peculiar, a tad obsessed with the interface between land and water and ocean. Van Allsburg asks you to bring your imagination to this story, instead of doing all the work himself. There's nothing wrong with that, if you're able."
4,The possibilities...,"Of course, we love ""The Polar Express"" by Chris Van Allsburg. He stirs together dreams and possibilities and create brand-new stories. ""The Wreck of the Zephyr"" is not as well-known, but give it a try.It is HARD to draw a sailboat out of the water, and some illustrations are a bit odd. Still, your children will get this story about a brave and adventuresome boy."
4,silly and fun for the kid w/ a green thumb,"Grass seeds spout and grow into hair. My daughter likes to wath it grow long then give it a ""haircut""."
5,Very Important,"This is a very important documentary for anyone who is in a sporting activity, has kids in sports or who is in healthcare in general to watch."
4,Head Games,Very interesting and informative. I showed it to a group of athletes and had a great discussion afterwards.Two days later the Belcher incident happened!
5,Using this as a follow-on to connect ancient Greece to ancient Rome,"So, we were captivated with Rosemary Sutcliff's ""Black Ships Before Troy"" and ""The Wanderings of Odysseus"", retelling the Iliad and The Odyssey, respectively.Black Ships Before TroyThe Wanderings of OdysseusThis book takes over from these, in similar writing style and high-quality illustrations, and tells the Aeneid, the story of the founding of Rome. It switches over to the Roman names of the Gods, but there is enough continuity with the other two books (even though the author/illustrator are different) to make this book a perfect third.Great for kids to read -- challenging vocabulary, heroic deeds and misdeeds.Check out the map at the back -- that's awesome. Also, there is a pronunciation guide to help your kids -- also at the back."
5,Great Book,"I read this book for school. It was really good! Fairly easy to read, very simple, but interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who likes ancient Romans,Greeks,or Greek myths. 5-star!!!"
3,Unnatural due to editing errors!,"I grew up in Maine and love the sound of loons in the quiet of night. That's the hitch with this CD. While loons mostly call at night, songbirds are quiet then. On this CD the songbirds twitter away along with the loons. WRONG!It seems like someone decided to fill in the quiet periods with daytime birdsong.The haunting power of loon calls is at least partly due to the silence they arise from. Here there is no silence. The effect is unnatural."
3,Loon Sounds,"While I love loon sounds, after a while this started to get on my nerves. I think you must be in a totally quiet room in order to really hear it. The sound of the Air Conditioner and other outside noises drowns out the Nature Sounds."
1,OMG THIS [STINKS],"if you're lookin for a song and it's on this cd, buy it, but don't be disapointed when it doesn't sound right.Drew's cds are fakes, and aren't close to what they seem.i bought this series one other time thinking it would be like the NOW collection. boy was i wrong.i almost bought this one for a song, but i didn't cuz i saw DREWS on it"
4,Cheap but does its job,"This isn't a real nice filter, but it protects the lens from scratches. That's all I need it for."
4,Insightful and Thought-Provoking,"Highly recommended for those interested in law-enforcement, city jobs in general, or who want an inside look at the workings of a rookie cop. Robbin pulls no punches when it comes to telling it like it is, develing into both the corrupt and mundane. This true story brings the reader on a 2 year journey alongside the narrator; following him, step by step, through the academy, the harrowing bronx streets, and finally culminating with his disgrace by the NYPD. Strong and relatable, Mr. Ramos' story is complete with facts, romance, and the tribulations of a twenty-something comming to grips with an unfortunate, life altering circumstance."
4,EXCELLENT,"The author is a local from my area (NYC) and I got my hands on a copy of LOST WINGS the first day it was released. The book started off a little slow but once I got into it, I could not put the book down! While the book involves the story of a police officer that lost his job, I think it's something that just about anyone can identify with. It is also interesting because the cop himself wrote the book. Overall a great book!"
5,History,I bought this for a friend who was adopted but recently found out that he is descended from Murray's sister. I bought him this book because he is already a dedicated witch and magician but I felt like it would help him to connect his tradition to his family. This book was totally worth the $60 just to give my friend some history. I skimmed it and it looked pretty awesome: Margaret Murray was some lady.
1,Rick Steves' Great Britain and Ireland 2000,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, especially if you are traveling to Ireland. I would have returned the book to Amazon.com, but I was so disgusted with it that I threw it away while I was in Europe. It was filled with misinformation and it lacked essential data. Mr. Steves has either never visited Ireland or doesn't understanding traveling there. According to him, there are only a few sites in all of Ireland to visit. Find a good travel book that tells you about the real Ireland, the many unspoiled hamlets and the wonderful people that populate them, the centries old relicts and the abundant outdoor activities, of which his book said nothing. His comments about Irish Catholics were also offensive. Even the chapter on London was full of errors."
4,"A ""how to"" on planning and getting the most from your trip.","All you need to know about planning your iteniary and nothing you don't. Good, honest, reliable information. I customized my book by adding tabs at all the places I planned to visit. I had nearly worn my copy out before I even left for my trip!"
3,Don't use this as your primary guide,"I used this book, along with many others, during my trip to Scotland this year. The book is very fun to read and gives interesting recommendations; however, Rick Steve's books are not for those who want to explore an area deeply. He tends to give you the ""whirlwind tour"" along with the occassional interesting off-the-beaten path site, but doesn't give you the deep detail on every site you might be interested in. If you are spending significant time there and want to get deeper, I would use Rick's guides, along with Eyewitness Guides, when planning the trip for the broad outline only (and leave them at home), and then use Fodor's and Michelin's Guides to get deeply into the areas you want to explore (and take them with you)."
2,Not much info related to Northern Ireland,"I'm a fan of Rick Steves, don't get me wrong! However, if you're looking for the usual indepth and detailed outline regarding the Northern part of Ireland, you will be sadly disappointed. There are very few pages covering the coast of Northern Ireland (in fact one could count the pages on one hand!). Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have ordered this book. So, this one will collect dust until I gain an interest in travel within Great Britain. I found it necessary to purchase an additional book that contained alot more info on Northern Ireland (Lonely Planet Ireland, 3rd Ed.).I recommend Rick Steves' books and videos however, save yourself some money if you're interested in information regarding travel in Northern Ireland!"
5,Intelligent Conversion Story,"This book is an intelligent conversion story. The author, Etty Hillesum, begins writing at a time when her life was repugnant; and yet, she is obviously very intelligent and so reading what she wrote during that period is not a waste of time.Towards the middle of the book, Etty begins to change, and by the end, she is an admirable person - not just because she is intelligent, but also because she is good. It seems that her will changed, which is the definition of conversion.I would compare this book favorably with ""Surprised by Joy"", which is the autobiography of C.S. Lewis. ""Surprised by Joy"" is a great book for Christians. ""Etty Hillesum"" is a great book for anyone.Shawn T. Miller"
5,femme d'aujourd'hui,"this diary of a young woman was written during WW2 ,some 70 years ago, but it looks like it had been written down by a woman of the 21st century. Her thoughts about people, her friends,her lovers,the war, fate and God show how a simple human being can be exceptional."
5,An Interrupted Life used book!,"I am very pleased with the service from Amazon, on the recent purchase, of a used next to new book. The book is in excellent condition and the delivery date was far earlier then first specified. I am just getting into the story and find it very interesting. I have also dealt with Amazon on several occasions and have only the best of things to say & report."
1,Office Depot cartridge is no good,"The Office Depot Model 56 Black Ink Cartridge is supposed to be a replacement for the HP 56 cartridge. It's not good. It worked for a very short time and then all of the sudden it couldn't be recognized by the printer anymore. I took it back to Office Depot and they refunded my money and let me upgrade to the HP 56 cartridge for the difference of the cost between the two, which was $3.25. Save yourself the trip and buy the HP 56 from the start."
1,Not professional quality,"Warning, this is NOT a professional quality stethoscope. I bought it as a backup to my regular one for nursing school, but it's pretty useless. I can barely even hear a heartbeat through it. My toddler does love playing with it though, so at least it wasn't a total waste."
4,Might vac,"Though a bit loud, this vacuum is backed by a 12 amp motor that picks up dust and dirt relentlessly. The attachments are handy and easy to attach. I find that this vac especially is effective on hardwood floors and kitchens.The bagless feature of course is the best. Gone are the days of paying a lot for bags.Best Van I have ever owned"
4,Long lasting,"I've had this vacuum for 12 years and I'm just now having to replace the belt, albeit we don't vacuum as often as we should so it hasn't had a lot of wear and tear. I would buy this vacuum again but I'm not sure that Hoover still makes it."
2,Motor tore itself apart!,"We were reasonably satisfied with this vacuum with a few exceptions that occurred over time (broken belt, vacuum seals on bagless container started to leak), until the vacuum motor actually ripped itself apart one day. Several sharp parts flew out of the vacuum and struck my wife in the face. The unit was three years old at the time.Customer service treated us with suspicion and were very difficult to deal with. I could not have been more unsatisfied with the experience or more disappointed in the method in which they treated their customers. This is the last Hoover product that I will purchase and encourge others to consider this when evaluating vacuums."
4,"Good, but slow","This was a good film, although at times it was a bit slow. I liked the character depiction and development. It handles successes and failures in relationships with extreme thought."
5,The Grocer's Son a good romantic movie,"I like the main character, a young man who wanted to follow a dream, it failed but he was too proud to go back home. His father has a heart attack and he goes home to help at the grocery store. He delivers food out in the rural area. At first he hated it and the people but Claire changed that and he became involved with the people. I didn't get to finish the movie but I plan to re-rent it. I want to know how it ends. Love well developed movie"
2,Ho Hum,"I found this pretty ho-hum. Not very captivating at all. It wasquite predictable, not very believable, and didn't keep my interest. I did watch thewhole thing, but I almost nodded off to sleep."
5,Wonderful movie...,"This was a lovely movie. There is always something refreshing about seeing someone become a better version of themselves...and this movie didn't disappoint in that regard. Great cast, pacing and storytelling. Would definitely recommend this movie!"
4,involving,A youth is forced by loss of his employment as a waiter in Paris to rejoin the family grocery business. His girl friend helps him to involve himself in the life of the community enough to make his delivery business a nominal success. His learned compassion gives him presence in his rediscovered world.
5,Leaves skin feeling great,"This is my favorite shave cream out there. I don't get much acne so I can't testify to the skin clearing part but after shaving it makes my skin feel awesome. This is the only product I use and the only one I'll keep using if they keep making it, which I hope they do. Highly recommended."
2,Doesn't live up to its claim,"I bought this based on the claim that it helps to prevent bumps, irritation, and ingrown hairs. I've suffered with all of those throughout my adult life. This product goes on nice and smooth and it isn't foamy or thick, which is fine with me. It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin, but in actuality it does not. I still end up with several cuts and many ingrown hairs. I gave this a good, thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors. I saw zero improvement in my complexion. Also, as one reviewer already wrote, this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.I was really hopeful this product would help me more, but after 3 tubes I can say I won't be buying anymore."
4,Best Shaving Cream I've Ever Used!,"I recently switched from using an electric razor to a ""straight-up one"" as I like to call them, and because of that, I had to use shaving cream of course. I've used three different types, and Neutrogena Men's Skin Clearing Shave Cream is my favorite by far!Before I purchased this product, I wanted to know how well it works on sensative skin, and when I saw the reviews for it that mensioned it works well, I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did!As an African American, I think my skin has a tendency to be more sensative, and this shaving cream works vary well with it! In fact, I don't remember getting any kind of irritation after using it!The only downside is the amount in the tube. 5.1 ounces gets used up real quick. LOL!Still, it's deffinetly worth it, especially if you have sensative skin!"
2,Disappointing,"I have been trying to like Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream. Really, I've tried as hard as I could. It's just that it doesn't really back up its claims. It hasn't helped to clear my skin at all. Furthermore, the fact that it's a non-foaming cream makes it excruciatingly difficult to spread completely across my face without having to use a ton. The directions say that using about a quarter-size amount is ""all you need."" Yet it provides little coverage -- and does not spread evenly enough to provide a comfortable shave. It also claims to provide exceptional razor glide but it does not. Razor glide if awful with this product."
2,Disappointed,"I don't agree with all the hype. I'm always looking for products that will make shaving easier and less painful, and this shave cream is now at the bottom of the stack under my sink. Is it just my skin? I don't think so. The cream doesn't go on easily--not smooth and rich--it's kind of like cold cream and it never warms up, AND it clogs up the razor something fierce. Whatever the science of it, I always end up with about 5 nicks and a raw face. Edge gel is better and cheaper. Zirh shave cream is better and more expensive."
1,A bad buy,I purchased this because it is says it can help clear up your skin. I've not noticed any difference. I've just wasted money on this.
3,Does not lather up!,"Although it says ""Low Foam Formula"" on the product description, I didn't imagine that it would barely lather up. Basically, the way it applied to my skin is exactly like a lotion. I had to use tons to get full facial coverage. This stuff is expensive and won't last very long because of how much you have to use per shave. Is it better than Edge? Yes, but it is not cost efficient."
3,"Pretty good, annoying smell","This stuff isn't bad. A decent price, used it ever since I started shavin, never got razor bumps, never broke out nothing.Only drawbacks are1) it isn't like a foam so you can't totally see where you've shaved. Can be difficult when you're at a campground or somewhere where you can't spend 5 minutes in front of the mirror.2) I really don't like the smell that much, but deodorant and body spray cover up for that.Overall..pretty good."
4,Great Product! Great Results!,"I have been using this shave cream for more than an year. I find it very satisfactory.It really is a cream. Don't look for the white Santa Claus beard that you get with foam. But whatever it has in it works extremely well to give a close, comfortable shave.I had used foams and gels for many years. I see no reason to go back. This cream is simpler, less messy and is not loaded down with odd smells.An incidental benefit is that the tube (container) for this cream is easy to travel with. It's much smaller than the typical can of foam and in general is much more packable.I used the cream on a one-day beard and on a three-day beard. Works fine with both."
4,"Excellent Performance & Recording, But It's Live","Having long been a fan of the 1973 E. Power Biggs recording of these two concertos on Columbia, with its stately majesty and glorious acoustics, I was intrigued to run across this budget-label release of the same two rarely-performed pieces. Curiosity impelled me to purchase it.It's really quite good. The pace is taken a little slower, which does not diminish the grandeur of the music, and the organ and orchestra sound really terrific with lots of thundering low end and powerful dynamics. Certainly nothing in the performance falls short of the requirements of the music.I was a little surprised to hear some coughing in the quieter moments and polite applause at the conclusion. It doesn't markedly detract from enjoyment of the performance -- in fact it emphasizes how terrific the performers are, to be this good without editing -- but nowhere on the cover is it mentioned that this is a live recording."
4,Speech therapy,These are great pictures for my work as a speech therapist. The pictures are large and realistic and the cards are durable. I just wish there were more than 3 pictures per category.
3,It's OK,I chose these because I work with Developmentally Delayed children and need prompts for language. The pictures are nice but not that practical. There is a picture of a toy that if from the 1960's in there. Not sure any children would be able to identify what that is. I also found there were a couple duplicate cards and something left out.
3,"Hmmm. It's great, but, would have been BETTER if...","The picture on the box is what I thought I was buying. Wouldn't that have been great to have pictures of FRUIT all together, and pictures of Water Animals all together, and shoes all together and so on.What I got instead were single picture cards, which I already had.Now, I did NOT return this because the pictures are nice and compliment our autism program, but, this would have been MUCH better product if the 'category' would have been included as a whole as well as individually.Just my 2 cents."
1,Carry a LOT of Batteries!!,"This thing plays ok, but the one I have exhausts a fresh set of name brand batteries by just playing through 1 standard audio cd. I have a Sony that will play a dozen or more. Tech support would not even acknowledge an email. In this fast-evolving market, products have to measure up and so does tech support. I would not recommend this player unless you are going to run it on an a/c adapter or you have a LOT of batteries you want to use up."
4,WAY BETTER THAN AN iPOD!,"I found this for only $39.99 and it's basically a small iPOD. This can hold about 10 hours of music on one CD, and CD's are interchangable, so you could carry around a case of them! Think about it: 700 MB for $40, or 40 GB for $400 plus accecories. With blank CD's at such cheap costs this is the best deal. I gave it four stars becuase it wont play my iTunes store music."
3,not great for car usage,"i got this cd player for my half hour commute to work. It's a great price, but the design is inconvienant. to change cd's you have to turn the player over on it's back. the battery cover opens quit frequently and subsequently ends up scratching the hell out of cd's- because the unit continues to spin the cd.however the battery life is much better than my old cd player that was about 13 years old. the buttons are different sizes- so it's easy to feel out what button you want to push... but it's still a little awkward. it's a great price and the sound is good quality. i just took away 2 stars because it's not very utilitarian for road warriors."
3,Inaccurate information,"The quality of the sound of this CD player is acceptable - The player is advertised as having a sixteen hour battery life, however I have never gotten more than six hours from the best AA batteries I could purchase and I am very disappointed with that. It significantly increases the price of owning and using this player. Also - the slightest shock makes the battery compartment pop open and the music stops."
5,Great Player for Audiobooks,"This player is the greatest player at the best price for audiobooks. It remembers exacly where you turned it off for the last 10 disks left in the player. Plays from 8Kbit to 196 Kbit MP3s.Love this player, would have payed a lot more for it."
3,Not for Jogging,"I bought the iRiver iMP50 for jogging. The anti-skip doesn't work well at all. Don't buy it for jogging.I tried CD-R, CD-RWs, and regular CDs. Despite the anti-skip settings that I tried, it would not play more than about 5 mins without starting to skip. Then it never recovers properly. Even if I held it fairly still, a technique that works great with my 4-year old Panasonic player, it just continues to skip, play a second or two, then skip some more. In order to get it playing again, I had to stop completely and hold it perfectly still, or better yet, turn it off, then back on. Then it will play for another 5 mins (or 2 mins for regular music CDs).Menu system is confusing. It takes a while to get used to, but if it would just work properly while jogging, I'd put up with that."
4,Great Value CDMP3 Player,"I have heard of iRiver many times but I cannot afford a $200 deluxe MP3 player like these guys make. I found the iMP 50 and at $49 thought it was worth a try. I got the unit - it plays my entire CD collection - MP3, WMA, etc.. plus regular CDs. Its got great volume & bass, plus a nice menu. It also came with an adapter to play my MP3 collection over my car stero. I never knew that was possible ? For $50 its very sweet!!"
2,NOT SO GREAT,"Hi all!!Its an okay player.Many times it takes so much time to start playing that it gets really frustrating.Also it doesnt recognize disks which have been used for some time.It just stops sometimesas it gets stuck.Its got some cool features.But after this experience with CD players i definitely would go for Memory players in future(like Ipod).Its so irritating to wait as this machine Whirrs for 3/4 mins before it starts playing the CD ,that one of the days i am just going to throw it out.ThanksRKS"
1,Wish I had read reviews before buying,"See the reviews below. my 2500mAh NiMHs play for about 75 minutes per charge. Won't read multi-session CDs, and tech support doesn't know why. A/C adapter only works if the player is kept perfectly still, otherwise power is lost. From time to time stops playing for 5 seconds - 2 minutes in the middle of tracks. I have never been this disapointed in a consumer electronics product."
1,Awful product. Awful customer service.,"Things the product description doesn't tell you:The disc loads through the BOTTOM of the player. Then you have to flip the player over to access the navigatorial buttons.Does not come with a car lighter adapter. I purchased one separately, only to find that the port is highly sensitive, and shuts off with the slightest jostle dislodging the connection. I obtained another adapter, and the same thing happened.Finally, this player sucks the life out of batteries at an unacceptably fast rate. You'll maybe be able to listen to a 70 minute CD twice before it's time to change the batteries.I contacted customer service to return it, only to be told that I had to return it with its original packaging - which I had disposed of.I will never again purchase a product from ""iRiver"". I would rather sit in silence than give another penny to this company."
1,This thing sucks,"If your looking for a good product, you are at the right site, BUT NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT. The instructions are hi tech chinese, it will barely play mp3 cds, and the quality, even with normal cds, is terrible, the headphones are the worst peace of crap i have ever seen, the cable is to short, they have a statick in the background and the base is very low. I am very dissapointed with the product."
2,Pretty Yet.....,"I want to keep this review as simple as possible. Besides all the pretty features as stated above says, there are a few things that may keep you away from this product:1. Takes to long to load music cd's.2. Annoying mechanical noise.3. Very short (30 mins) battery life.4. Poor design. It would break easily.I recommend one looking for a cd player, look at the Sony Walkman products."
1,The IMP-50 isn't quiet so nifty,"To say I'm disappointed and quiet dismayed is an understatement. I was hoping for good things with the ""iRiver IMP 50,"" but this isn't the case now.It wouldn't initialize when I turned it on. The player read neither regular audio cds or mp3s. It did, however, make a disturbing knocking sound when it tried to read new media and powered off when it couldn't.""iRiver"" is suppose to be top of the line w/ it's players, but this particular model leaves a lot to be desired. I dunno, maybe I got a lemon. For 10 dollars more, I may consider the ""IMP 150"" and hope I have better luck w/ that. The reviews on it would seem to concur."
4,It is the best deal you can find now,"I have it for 2 months. It works great and play all kindof cd and mp3. The battery life is good enough. Theheadphone has good sound quality. My only complain isthat the left earbud can't fit my ear well. I can't complainmy ear to God neither my parents, hence I give it a 4-stars."
5,This book was truly outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a very very very good book!! I like the way that Stine swicthed the characters talking that in my opinion was so cool. It drove me nuts tring to figure out who mouse was but I won't spoil the book like someone else did for you(You know who you are!)
5,Greatest R.L. Stine book ever.,"The lifeguards at North Beach Country Club know they're lucky. While other kids are flipping burgers, they're sunning themselves by day and partying by night. So what if some people say the place is cursed, haunted. This is the life! And then, one by one, the lifeguards start to die horrible deaths. Someone-or something-evil is stalking them. They all know how to save other people's lives...but who will save theirs? Original"
5,HIS BEST EVER,His very very very best ever!!!! So many twists and turns in the plot . I would recomened it to anyone
3,Ehhh...,"I suppose I would recommend this CD...expensive price for not that many remixes...the remixes aren't that great either, except for the No More 8-Jam Step Mix, it's cool. Anyway, if you really like rare 3LW merchandise, I suppose you should buy this. hope i helped you make your choice"
4,not suitable for big thighs!!!!,"This is a cute, actually really good quality item, it's just not meant for big butts!!!!!!!!"
1,You don't become a master with this book,"Don't let the title fool you - it should have been: ""Beginning GoLive"", not ""Mastering GoLive"". The book covers a lot of basic subjects that only adresses users on an absolute beginners level - all the intermediate and advanced stuff is left out. A lot of pages are wasted on basic descriptions of other Adobe products (E.g. Photoshop, Illustrator), but if I wanted to read about those programs, I would have bought a book covering that, right! The space could have been used for describing powerful GoLive features like CSS, DHTML, floating boxes and stuff like that, which are all left out.In short: read the GoLive manual and buy a more sophisticated book (Like ""Real World GoLive"") instead!"
3,Title is misleading--proceed with caution,"If you want an introduction to web design which includes GoLive 4.0 and other Adobe products, then this book is for you. However, if you want in-depth coverage of floating boxes, CSS, DHTML, even rollovers (not even mentioned), then look elsewhere. I personally profited from some of the coverage of other Adobe products, but this will not apply to everyone. To really MASTER GoLive, start with the manual and the excellent QuickTime tutorials on Adobe's web site."
1,Too basic,I have to agree with some of the 'critical' reviews here.There was too much info about 'good design' and what you need to think about but that wasn't the point I bought this book. It wasn't until much later that they actually got into the details of starting the program.Even then they weren't that useful. I found I knew most of what they taught me even before I started the book because I had fooled around a bit first.There was nothing knew and supposedly there's some 'hot' features in Golive which makes it comparable to Dreamweaver. I have to say after reading this book: what features?Plus talking so much about 'other' programs.. such a waste since you may as well get a book on those. What you teach here is not going to be substantial enough to even consider.
1,By far the WORST!,I was looking forward to learn a lot about Adobe Golive. Whata disappointment! You only master frustration and anger by readingthis book. The authors have gone through extensive effort and length to avoid explaining adobe golive. Seventeen chapters and I am still not sure how CSS and Dhtml that are powerful parts of the program work. The title is very misleading... You can learn more by reading adobe online quicktime tutorials or by buying the training CD...
2,An overpriced workbook,"Too bad the teacher required it for class. It is boring, simple, and generally makes you feel like a 5th grader filling in the blanks. Would have been better if just an online tutorial."
3,My mouth doesn't feel any different,"I was hesitant to use this toothpaste, wondering if it would be too strong. I decided to give the benefit of the doubt and try it.The taste of the toothpaste is pleasantly surprising (you can put it in your mouth without burning) and I am admittedly fascinated by the suspended mini-breath strips.My mouth however does not feel any fresher than with the prior toothpaste. I think the selling point for this product actually is the 'breath strips' inside the gel."
3,No problems,"Despite the very negative review below, I bought a package of these screen protectors for my new Cingular 8125. I agree that they're not terribly easy to apply, but no screen protectors are. Unless you're really anal about it, you can get the screen protector on mostly straight and covering most of the screen without too much effort.As for being unable to tap the screen with the protector applied, I don't know what the previous reviewer was doing or not doing. I have had absolutely zero problem with this. The stylus works as well as it ever did, screen protector or not.I'm not jumping up and down about this product; it's just a screen protector and is difficult to get excited about it. It does what it's supposed to do, and it's not as bad as the review below would indicate, at least not in my experience."
2,I just did not like it,"I was required to read this for a 20th century america class. I would not recommend it.It is written in the viewpoint that the New Deal was what saved America from the Depression. It offered little criticism and failed to show the numerous unintended consequences which resulted from the New Deal (during the immediate time).It did say, however, that FDR was pragmatic - so they got that one right.I am sure there are better books out there. I would recommend ""No Ordinary Time."""
2,A disappointing experience,"I was disappointed in this phone. To begin with, the enclosedbattery was almost dead. ..And as for the so-called superior sound, Idisagree. I wound up giving away the phone... I'd advise you to stay away from Uniden! END"
4,Great Phone,"I'm writing this review after owning this phone for somewhere between 8 and 9.5 years. The first two phones that arrived had drop off issues. Uniden replaced each one and the third phone was a charm.It had great sound and I could walk with it to the corner store and not lose my connection. I dropped the unit hundreds of times over the years and while the battery cover flew off most times, the phone just kept on working.Sadly, it quietly expired the other day and I was so used to its constancy that I simply started at it stupified. It really was dead. Not the battery, but the phone.8-9.5 years from a cordless phone is an impressive testament to Uniden quality. I just got my research done on their new models and ordered the DECT 2085-3 from Amazon. I'll share that review later."
2,"Range, yes; but usability, no","After over a month i'm thoroughly disappointed with thisphone. ... The Talk button is positioned so that it's almost impossible not to hang up on your call if you put the phone to your shoulder. There is a constant whine in the background when speaking. While the range is good, the phone crackles and cuts-out regularly when well within range of the base. It's not my phone line causing these problems. Think twice before buying."
2,Spen a little more on a phone,"Uniden overall makes fine phones..........just not this model. I get alot of static in the phone. It's like my cell phone, I have to keep turning my head to get clear reception. SPEND A FEW DOLLARS MORE GET SOMETHING ELSE."
2,I agree with the person who called this phone a hockey puck,"When we purchased this phone it worked great for the first six months. Now the base unit will not charge the battery (or the replacement battery). If you unplug the unit, then plug it in again - it will charge for a couple of seconds and then stop. This phone is a complete joke. I have the backup puck for anyone who was interested. I will never buy another Uniden phone!!!!!!!"
3,great sound; problem buttons,"I love the sound quality and range of this phone. However, it has a serious flaw: I keep accidentally hanging up because the large talk and flash buttons press against my cheek bone if I wedge the phone between my head and shoulder. I wish there were a fix for this because otherwise it's a great phone (maybe I should try a headset)."
3,"Useful, but clunky.","If you are actually thinking of buying this, then you are either shopping for a university library, or you are an absolute madman like me. This book is a rather heavy sword to wield, but useful sometimes.For some other Indogermanic languages, the standards are:Icelandic/Old Norse: de Vries, Altnordisches Etym. WörterbuchModern German: Kluge, Etym. Wörterbuch der deutschen SpracheOld English: Holthausen, Altenglisches Etym.

[excellent bathroom book!]Watkins: ""How to Kill a Dragon."" [on Indogermanic poetics]You can get most all of these here. Viel Glück!"
1,UNHAPPY,JUST REALIZED AFTER ONE MONTH THAT THE GLUE GUN I RECEIVED IS NOT THE ONE PICUTRED ON THE WEB SITE. I AM SURE I CAN NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW. VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.
1,not so hot,"Unless your pain is in the palm or the back of your hand, this product is not so hot. Mine is fingers and pad of thumb....pretty useless for these areas."
3,Hallmark Collector set v.1,I do not regret the purchase. I have watched all of the movies and they were good clean entertainment but not the greatest Hallmark has to offer.
5,"Great ,movies","Hallmark always hass great movies. These are some of the best. Where else can you get six great movies for $11.99. If ou buy this, you won't be sorry."
5,Hallmark Collector Set V.1 (6-Movies),All 6 movies live up to the Hallmark excellence. The price was very good for a boxed set.
1,Disappointment,"I did a search for the Hallmark movie ""Head of the Class"", and the Collector Set V.1 came up. Since it did not tell what the 6 movies were, I assumed that ""Head of the Class"" was in it. When it arrived I discovered the movie I wanted was not included. I kept it anyway in case I want to watch them someday. So far I have not opened the package. If you can help me get the movie I wanted, it would be appreciated.Rating should be no stars. Since you will not accept my comments without any I put in one star."
3,better than a kick in the head!!!!!!!,I love fantasy island and the first season doesn't disappoint... It is fantasy island you get what you expect.... If you love the '''everything will be right thing'''' then this is your show and sometimes it has a kick but still expected but fits into the story... I love fantasy island because we all want to be on this island secretly for one reason or another and it shows us what we want isn't always the best thing.... But everything works out for the best in the end....
5,"Okay, so I couldn't possibly have played it yet. But C'MON!","Sure, it's not even out yet and I'm rating the holy hell out of it. But C'MON! Imagine if the original Star Wars Trivial Pursuit and the game Scene It had a kid together... There's no way it wouldn't be great!Again, I argue... C'MON!"
3,"A mandatory read for Tony's fans, but lacks depth.","I came away disappointed by this book. While there are many insights into how Tony became such a great man and the best singer this planet has ever know, the book is too much of a long list of names and dates, and not much more. It needed more depth in some areas and less of ""<name>, one of my all-time best friends and the greatest <singer, pianist, drummer, whatever> ever."" Still, Tony's fans need to read it anyway, to understand his committment to excellence and to appreciate how he never wavered from that committment, for which we can all be thankful -- it is why we will always have his legacy. Jazz musicians in particular will love the introductory quote from the surprising source of John Steinbeck."
5,no title,"This is an amazing record. I've been listening to it since at least two weeks and I guess I like it better than their first effort. It seems that the songs selected and manipulated here give you this feeling of unity while listening to the record.For new listeners of the Black Ox Orkestar, please be aware that this is traditional jewish music played by (non)traditional [jewish] musicians.Enjoy for the beauty of it."
4,cool game,"Casper is playing with his friends in playground and their having all sorts of fun,but in the meantime a unfriendly ghost sends all of caspers friends into diffrent places.This game is pretty short,good graphics,this game is pretty funny too!like the part once you fight Fatso He'll start throwing pies at you.This game is also pretty hard to beat."
4,Concise version of the hardcover Sybex Study Guide,"This book is the condensed version of the big hardcover SQL 7.0 Administration Study Guide also published by Sybex. As a matter of fact, at least half the content was lifted word for word from the big book, moreso than in other Exam Notes books I've used.This book was helpful as a supplement to the MOC but if you already have the big book from Sybex, you can skip this one.The book does a good job of covering each exam objective as put forth by Microsoft and is fairly well readable."
2,Save Your Money,"Practice questions were too easy and too few in number. Sybex has a lot of good study guides out there but this is not one of them. A better subject review can be found in the back of the excellent full sized study guide ""SQL Server 7 Administration,"" by Christopher Wille et al., New Riders, 1999, ISBN 0735700036.While I'm at it I'd also recommend the following texts for the 70-028 exam:""Teach Yourself SQL Server 7.0 in 21 Days,"" by Richard Waymire and Rick Sawtell, Sam Publishing, 1999, ISBN 0672312905; and,""Transact-SQL Programming,"" by Kevin Kline et al., O'Reilly & Assoc., 1999, ISBN 1565924010.Both of these texts will also help with the 70-029 exam should you volunteer for the punishment."
5,Great for Vision Impaired,I bought this for one of my Sunday School kids who is legally blind. The 14 point font is perfect for her and she can now read Scripture with us aided by just her glasses.
5,Good for english students,"I am a English student, as far as a Bible reader and Jesus follower.In this exemplar I found excellent tool for improve my English think capacity.Its big font type enhance text assimilation experience too.No good is you weight, sometimes so heavy to handle."
1,Giant Print Bible purchase,"They sent the wrong version. I requested a New International Version, and Amazon sent a King James Version."
2,Predictability is bliss,"Not too subtle horror movie, where the murderer kills the girls in different manners. Entertaining, yes. Predictable, yes. But it seems to be intented to be predictable. As if the makers were thinking that ""stupid is clever"". It kind of works.The mid-80's was fantastic. Jazzdance, bikes with drop handlebar, jeans that don't fit, t-shirts neatly tucked into the jeans.A lot of nudity, which of course is morally questionable. At least it serves the overall purpose of the movie. Predictability. All girls who show their breasts on screen get killed, and noone who doesn't. In other words, appearing topless is what the philosophers call ""the necessary and sufficient condition"" to be killed.While one may think that conscious predicibility is fun, and that stupidness for a purpuse is art, we may have to remind ourselves that fun doesn't necessarily mean good. And while ""stupid is clever"" kind of works, we also know that stupid is stupid."
2,I do not like it,"I don't really like it, examples are not that good, explanations are not that good either, i think your textbook is probably way better"
3,Good overview...and sample problems,this was an average book on the subject with good sample problems. a good resource for a student
2,"Watch nice, Customer Service not","I bought this watch for my husband as a Christmas gift, when i received it, it was defective. The telephone number listed always rang busy, so I had to research to find a direct number. They offered to ship out again and have it here by Christmas but the watch never came."
3,Almost Essential,"If you are in doubt, listen it. There is a lot of hits in this CD. To be ""truly essential"" it will be necessary ""I Don't Believe"" and ""Tomorrow Started"".Copy ControlledIn some cases use ITunes software and you can rip the album with no problem. If you have some, use a software called easy cd/da extractor. Copy Controlled will not a headache anymore.It works."
5,"Perfection, but advanced","This is one of the best written physics books to ever hit the market. However, it deals with an advanced topic and its not for the faint of heart or those without the proper background. Weinberg's writing style is remarkably clear. A historical introduction (which is very enlightening) is followed by a nice chapter on relatavistic quantum mechanics. Later chapters which I found very useful include a chapter titled ""Quantum Fields and Antiparticles"", where he introduces the Dirac formalism, and ""The Feynman Rules"", which is one of the best presentations on this topic I have come across. Chapters on the Lagrangian methods and path integrals are also good. I would strongly advise the reader to thoroughly study other quantum field theory books before tackling this one.Also recommended (to get started): ""Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell"""
3,Great Series-OK Reunion-Terrible recording to DVD,"I have always been a big fan of the Man from UNCLE, and I own the VHS version of this recording. I was excited to see that it was released on DVD, and preordered it when I saw it was about to be released. I just watched the first 20 minutes, and was really disappointed. The video quality is very poor. It appears to be a recording from an old VCR, as the picture shakes back and forth enough to be really annoying. When Janice Friday is introduced, we are all introduced to the new ""enhanced sound,"" whatever that means. Problem is, there is no sound at all for about five seconds. I may never watch the rest of the DVD, as the tape is actually superior in quality.The video is not clean, and the sound is certainly less than advertised. I believe they made this in someone's garage. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is ""The Man from UNCLE."" My advice to all of my fellow fans is to try and find a VHS version and make your own DVD."
2,Not This DVD,"The series was great, the Return is okay, but the DVD is terrible. If they're going to re-release this series (and they should) then the DVD should be of better quality. What did they do with this one, record it off a TV screen? It's awful. Whoever thought fans of the series wouldn't notice is way off base. I'd really like to see the entire series come to DVD, but not like this. Get a clue, and do it right!"
3,Good story-poor quality video.,"Being a huge U.N.C.L.E. fan I eagerly awaited this release. The storyline was as I remembered, but I was looking forward to a DVD quality release with extras. The quality was worse than VHS recorded off of broadcast TV and the extras consisted of the cast.The cover had a misprint 350,000,00.00(sic). In all the quality of the print is less than I would have expected from an Ebay purchase. If the regular season shows are ever put on DVD I hope that a professional does the transfer."
1,Big disappointment,"The video was poor & the audio dropped out in 2 scenes.The DVD includes some ""Trailers"" for other programs which are, at best, soft porn. I don't want this product in my house.I have returned the DVD for a refund."
1,DVD before the Baby Boomers die!,"I never saw this movie. But if Warner Home Video (which apparently now owns the rights to the series) wants to make a pant-load of money off The Man From U.N.C.L.E., they'd better get on this stick. Nobody under 40 remembers this show at all, since it never went into long-term syndication. The first Baby-Boomers, who are the real fans of this show, and remember it nostalgically, are ready for the dvds before we get too old to see! Just make sure it's a quality release, not the miserable quality this dvd lays claim to."
1,A mediocre remake,"I watched this made for television film which aired roughly fifteen years after the original show went off the air. In this poor hack of a reunion movie, the two agents are asked back by a new UNCLE chief (who would ever guess uncle would still be alive after 15 years after the spy craze?) to recover an escaped THRUSH criminal (who the agents never met in their old days); why would they need two retired agents who never knew the criminal they are after????????????????????????????????Why take two tired older men, one fairly out of shape, reunited them only to send them in opposite directions???????????What a hoot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is clearly a remake to end any and all remakes. I can understand teeny boppers who still lust after aging RV and DMC still think they make their juices flow, but this is ludicrous.The appearance of a former 007 actor (a one-film man) in the flick makes this a mediocre rag of a film ever the more! No way!!!"
4,This is a good book for beginning playwrights.,Complete treatment and helpful. Easy to read and well organized. Good exercises.
5,Second only to Catron's first book.,"Louis Catron is the most highly respected playwriting instructor of our time, and deserves every ounce of credit playwrights give him. Rather than bog us down with poetic inspiration, Catron gives us the structure of a solid script, in simple and useful language and layout. The difference between ""playwriting"" and ""playwrighting"" is the bottom line of Catron's excellent instruction. For those who prefer writing to talking/thinking about writing, his books are simply the best."
5,Excellent for Bare-Bones Structure,"Catron's latest shares excellent information concerning the basics of playwriting. The finest well-known playwriting instructor of our time, this book is second only to Catron's first (also available here), and one that can only be gotten via private distribution. Uh oh. I just realized I wrote a review for this a year ago."
1,will burn your face off,this thing is a peice of .... ive had 2 and both after 5 or so hours start spewing out massive amounts of glue out the vents which pours onto your hand and give you damn near 3rd degree burns. so be a friend to your skin spend 10 extra bucks and buy a brand name
1,Not recommended,"I do a lot of crafting with a glue gun and have gone through a bunch of cheap ones. So I decided to try a better product and purchased this Arrow TR550. I was very disappointed. It drips like crazy, and the glue builds up in the tray that doubles as a stand. When you go to use it this puddle of glue is in the way and often ends up burning your fingers. If you don't clean it out while it is hot, which is not that easy, it dries and glues the nozzle to the stand. Actually the whole stand is pretty useless, as the gun is unstable and often just falls over when you put it down. I would have to say that the cheap $7.99 guns I have used work better and are easier to use than this one. I do not recommend it."
3,Drips and Tips - thought it would be better,"Lowe's only had two Arrow models, and I got the higher priced one, figuring an extra three bucks for a Professional Model would give me the best they got.Well, maybe that's true. Maybe it is the best Arrow has.Sure drips a lot for a Non-Drip Nozzle.And the design of the Safety Stand puts the pile of drip right under the tip of the nozzle, so its soon resting in its own pile of ....Would like to see a more standard (i.e. solid, permanent, non-tip) stand, instead of this one that folds away (with the ball of melted glue on the end)."
3,two annoying problems with this glue gun,1st-the glue sticks fall out when the gun is pointing up until they feed in a ways.very annoying.have to hold it in place till then.2nd-the stand is worthless.
4,together by fate!,"Amparo Reyes' life revolves around her bed and breakfast inn that resides near the Jemez Mountains. She takes pride in making each of her customer's visits special and some of her clients are more like family. However when an unexpected quest arrives she starts to yearn for more in her life.Enrique Aleman is strongly urged to take a vacation to relieve stress due to his work habits and fate leads him to Amparo's inn. He is touched by the peaceful tranquillity of a place so far removed from his hectic life in Miami. And his instant attraction to the lovely innkeeper is an added bonus.This sweet story is quite picturesque, telling a romantic tale as it paints a beautiful vision of New Mexico in a reader's mind. I was humbled by how fate brought this couple together at this point in their lives when they needed love the most. True love knows no bounds!"
5,Large hoves for large dogs,"Cow Hooves PKG of 50 from Butch's TreatsBest price,so I was leary of the size of the treats. They were large and last longer.Dogs love them.Stops them from chewing on other things.Much better than rawhide treats that they eat rapidly;makes them sick."
4,Does what it is says it does!,it does exactly what the product is made to do. the ice after a shot or two if left out tends to melt with cracks and before you know it your liquor is leaking out when your pouring shots. not anything to do with the product just the way ice melts. if left in the freezer and in the cupps it works pretty well and is not slippery like holding a piece of ice. all in all it seems to do the trick. waiting to try jello shots in this.
1,Sheesh; it's a paper back,"While this is a good book the current prices on available copies are exhorbitant. The illustrations are mediorcre and there are better, current resources. I say go to the library and read it, return it, and if you really want it, wait for a reprint."
5,One of the Schopenhauer's inspirations,"One of the Schopenhauer's inspirations (especially in ""On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient Reason"") gives a classical perspective on the modern German thought. Wonderful!!!"
3,OK,"The majority of the book is spent describing how to make vinegar. I don't want to make my own. I was more interested in the uses of ""store bought"" vinegar."
3,Plain layout but informative.,"Add this book to your collection but keep looking. Some sections pressume a certain knowledge level, which I don't yet have. The interior layout is plain and not enjoyable to peruse but still good info on history. I also bought ""Real Food Fermentation"" by Alex Lewin. I highly recomend his book. Excellent graphics and layout. Very well laid out instructions and photos-this book is a pleasure to read."
3,The Vinegar Book,Many years ago I bought this book in hard form and loved it. My Mum also loved it so I gave her my copy. I recently found it on my Kindle and purchased it. Re read it and was remineded of some very useful uses for both cider vinegar and white vinegar. I gave it 3 stars as the Kindle version isn't as easy to find the info I was looking for.
5,Like the show love the game,"It all boils down to those who like the Bears and those who do not. If you are a fan, then this is a great game title. It is for kids, I find my 6 year old likes it much better than the 4 year old. It is like many other Gameboy Color games in both play and graphics but has the beloved Bears. Simply put, it is not a next generation title, buy it for the love of the Bears."
5,A Book on Civility Written by...a Lawyer? ;->,"Very inspiring take on our society'surgent need for civility from anintelligent and articulate lawprofessor. I highly recommend this book.(Yes! Believe it or not,a book on civility written by a lawyer! LOL)And that snide, side comment, Carter mightsay, is the very type of thing that underminesour world. Sorry. Apologies to all lawyers.No more sarcasm. No more cynicism."
5,"Excellent review of ""good behavior""","CivilityThis book is not a book of etiquette. It is an historical review, leading to how personal behavior affects our society. It is not a ""feel-good"" book about success or personal growth. It is spiritually aligned within the Judeo-Christian tradition, and makes a solid contribution in proposing the need of this influence in our society. It is a classic of contemporary thought, and could well be a textbook in a class on ethics in a Christian college. The actual issues of ethics (doing good) are thoroughly explained here. Highly recommended."
2,Excellent Book for the Self-Righteous,"Stephen L. Carter is a distinguished professor of Law at Yale University. He makes it clear that he is a Christian and writes from that perspective. He spends much time pointing out what everybody already knows, viz. that we live in a highly uncivil, angry, and impolite society. This book will most likely be read by those who are already concerned about that fact. But the tone of Carter's pronouncements will not make you feel compassionate concern for those who WON'T be reading this book. And so it is, at bottom, a sermon to the converted, with all the self-righteous overtones one expects from a dignified member of U.S. society. Nobody who has not already been seduced into feelings of guilt and repentance should get anywhere near this book. It will simply enrage you, and make you want to become uncivil all that much more."
3,Broil King Warming Tray from Ace Hardware,I ordered this warming tray because I have one just like it and it worked well and was borrowed frequently by other family memebers. The product description said it had a concentated heat spot. The tray I received from Ace Hardware was a nice warming tray but it did not have the concentrated heat spot. I did not attempt to return as it was a Christmas gift. Be careful to inspect what you receive from Ace Hardware.
1,Disappointed with shipping quality and product versus description,"I ordered this for my mother as a gift. I received the box with no shipping packaging. The product box has shipping stickers all over it and also was sitting on my front porch where my mother was able to see exactly what was in the box. Not happy to pay this kind of money and not even got shipping packaging. As stated by another review, no packing list enclosed just the messy packing labels on the gift box. Also, the picture on the site shows this as having white/clear flowers. The box I received has pink flowers which I know is NOt what my mother wanted. I will be attempting to return. Hopefully I have more success than others who've had the same complaints. I wish I had read the reviews more thoroughly before purchasing.I am not rating on actual performance of product as I am too unhappy with packing method and variance from item described to open and use the product."
2,"Pretty Lamp, NO REPLACEMENT BULB!","I bought this lamp in March 2008. It worked pretty well and is nice lamp. My problem is that after about 16 months the bulb burned out and i thought, well its easy to fix. NO, it doesn't matter what bulb i try, it just doesn't work anymore, it stays on at its brightest setting and the ""touch"" doesn't work, to turn it on or off i have to plug/unplug it! Too bad, i really liked this lamp!"
1,Touch Lamps,The Lamps Plus Polished Brass Lamps I purchased were JUNK!!! None of the glass pieces matched up to the holes so I could not insert the glass pieces in there. I feel like I paid good money for these to have them not even be workable. What a horrible business you run!!!!!!!!
5,A very pretty little lamp,"I wasn't sure about this little lamp because it was so inexpensive. And when I took it out of the box I had to put it together. But once put all together and in place it is really beautiful. It looks so good on my nightstand. And a bonus is that it shows a soft pretty pattern on the wall above it. It is also a touch to turn on lamp and has three settings. They sent a little light bulb with it so I didn't need to buy anything else for it. A good deal for the price.I bought this in October of 2007. It stopped working last week, 3/2009, and is very hot to the touch on the bottom so I think it may be dangerous. I will have to throw it out. Too bad. I liked it."
1,lamp,"Ordered a lamp from Lamps Plus. Some where along the line the product was changed from a lamp with pink flowers to gold flowers. I did not know until after my order was already shipped, so I could not cancel it then. Contacted Lamps Plus, who said I could return it and they would send a prepaid shipping label. After 4 weeks of calls and emails, I paid to ship it myself. Company web site says that items are shipped with info on how to return and their return policy, but it came with no paperwork except shipping labels on the actual product box and assembly directions inside. Was not happy with product, how company ships products, customer service or returns policy. Hoping I will be able to get my money back."
4,Was expecting a different look,"When I saw this lamp on Amazon, I thought the shade was a frosted glass with clear flower accents. When I received it, the glass was white. The picture is a little deceiving. Would have rather had a frosted lamp but I decided to keep this one anyway. Overall, it's a nice lamp."
3,"""See Spot Live Longer""--My Review","This is an easy book to read and it can be read in a couple of hours. The book contains good information about pet nutrition, but it did not tell me anything I didn't already know except for the appropriate phosphorous to calcium ratio for pets (dogs and cats) on a raw meet diet. It also warned against feeding raw salmon. Those were the only two points I got out of the book. The book has spent an unreasonable amount of time reiterating how bad pet food bought from grocery stores is. I already knew that which is why I always buy premium pet food with top 3 or 4 ingredients being meat (no meat byproducts!). For me the book was marginally informative, but for others who may not have already thought much about pet nutrition, this book will give them useful information. If you already know quite a bit about pet nutrition, then this book is very elementary and probably of no use to you.--nick"
4,the missing link,"It's a little known fact that the VU and the Grateful Dead both started out calling themselves ""The Warlocks,"" and it's fascinating to those of us (the few, the brain-damaged and alienated) who love both bands. These discs serve as the missing link that we always knew was out there, particularly the extended versions of ""Sister Ray"" (at least as long as the average ""Dark Star""). My only question is when they're going to dig up some tapes of the original lineup with John Cale's screaming fiddle and the occasional elusive presence of Nico"
4,4/5 Stars: For Real Fans,"The Quine Tapes are a great insight into live Velvet, however its is a costly investment. The set lacks a healthy variety of songs and rarities. The sound quality is weak -It's a BOOTLEG - so be prepared. This set is for Velvet collector's only. If you don't on the Peel Slowly Box Set - save up a few more bucks and buy that instead. Each disc contains a some great jams however the quality is low and the audience is poor. At some points you can hear a woman discussing something over the conncert!But over all I have to say the Velvets are always worth listening to, howver this set is for those like me who want it all."
4,Follow the leader,"Overall, worse than ""Live, 1969""--the best live rock band record alive. Much better though than ""Max's Kansas City"", which is ruined with Billy Yule's monster drums (where one can hear how soon Lou's solo career would sound). Certainly, the quality of this is worse than Max's, it's however, the VU at the top of their game, similar to ""Live, 1969."" This collection includes estimable versions of ""Sister Ray"" which is preferable to early bootleg versions with John Cale (the 38:00 minute version is otherworldly)--and, it positively must be true they were a much better live band during this period. All said and done, the linchpin is the 17:00 minute version of ""Follow the Leader,"" an extended rhythm guitar marathon w/ a mighty band pumpin' in unison. The 10:00 version of ""White Light/White Heat"" comes a close second...And if you want to really know how good this is, dig up how it influenced Robert Quine's guitar playing. ""You know his life was changed by rock-n-roll."""
4,You know you need it,"This is great stuff. Not as laid-back as some of the ""1969""-album but maybe notas rough as some of the bootlegs of the same period (for example ""Hilltop festival"").You do have to be really interested in the Velvets, there are three 30+minutes versions of ""Sister Ray"".."
3,"O, How i wish I could have been there.....","The Quine tapes are not very listenable....there more of an artifact. Doug Quine was lucky enough to capture some of the Velvets' shows at very small clubs in San Fransisco, and thirty-some years later we have the results. The sound is very poor....the selections, however are terrific......I especially apreciated hearing stripped-down versions of ""Sunday Morning"", ""What Goes On"", and ""I Can't Stand It"". Also, the three versions of Sister Ray are brilliant.....a perfect climax to every disc. Maureen Tucker sings her 2 signature songs (""I'm Sticking With You"" and ""Afterhours"") as cute as a button.....hearing this is so bittersweet......it makes me wish I could have seen them in their prime."
3,In case you don't know who Robert Quine is.....,"I've not had the chance to listen to this yet, so pay no attention to my rating (it had to be done to get this out on the site) but to give you guys some context about the other reviews on this page: Robert Quine is/was a punk rock guitar pioneer, founding member (w/Fred Maher) of Richard Hell and the Voidoids, an avowed huge fan of Lou Reed's guitar work, and ultimately, a featured guitarist for Reed. Quine, who believe it or not is now 61 years of age, champions a beautifully distorted sound out of his instrument and is probably best known (along with Richard Lloyd) for his labors on Matthew Sweet's breakthrough work in the early '90s. In other words, Quine is not just any other Lou Reed fan...."
5,fantastic A must,"Don't miss out on this and disregard any criticism of the sound quality----IT DOESN"" MATTER! What we have here is perhaps the great missing link between Chuck Berry and The Sex Pistols and finally a live recording by the Velvets that actually matters (1969 is sonewhat weak). At any rate 3 discs of pure Velvet bliss--3 versions of ""Sister Ray""(1 that clocks in around 40 mins)some unreleased material(Follow The Leader is particuliarly good) and the usuals ""Venus In Furs"" ""Heroin"" etc. A must for anyone who care anything about real rock n roll.....the only negative for me was that ""Heroin"" was a bit short and there's only one version of it here but on the flipside theres no Nico...thank goodness........."
4,Awesome Album,"Bought this album directly from the fellow in the Union Square station of the NY subway. Took it home and grooved. Awesome production, great music."
2,VERY BASIC,I think this book would be okay for someone who just needs VERY basic usage of ADO. The examples provided are very simple and there is no detailed info anywhere. There is not even a mention of the topic of OpenSchema and there is a 1 paragraph reference to ADOX & ADOMD. I recommend the ADO 2.1 Programmer's Reference by David Sussman.
3,Too bad we must rely on Microsoft,"Mr. Gunderloy's book makes for very good reading. It is by far the most well written Visual Basic book that I have come across. Unfortunately, most of the really interesting things in the book require ADO version 2.5--which apparently Microsoft released and then unreleased. There's nothing more irritating than having to use the Microsoft web site and then discovering the download you need is not available. Microsoft is supposed to re-release ADO 2.5 on February 17, 2000. When it does, this book will be very useful."
3,Visual Basic Developer's Guide to ADO,I just Purchased: Visual Basic Developer's Guide to ADO by: Mike GunderloyAt this line of code in the very first example : Private WithEvents mcnn As ADODB.ConnectionI get this Error: Missing: Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.5 LibraryMicrosoft.com/data does not publish ADO 2.5 yet
5,Most Fun I've Ever Had With Rocks,"I haven't painted since childhood and was shocked at the cost of canvas and ""traditional"" painting media. I happened upon this book, obtained some rocks from a friend's pasture and have been painting rocks ever since! We don't have the smooth river rocks in our local streams, so I go to a local rock yard to get them which yielded some excellent customers for my creations! I've had more fun painting in 3-D. The illustrations and directions are EXCELLENT! Anyone can do this with these great books!"
5,Just what was I was looking for.,I thought this would be a fun painting hobby. Found this book to be very informative and it gives clear instructions. Am looking forward to beginning this project next summer.
2,Not what I expected,After reading Soul Mate Dissapate I was so mesmerized by each chapter and felt sad when it came to my end. Imagine my delight when I read that Justice Just Us Just Me would be the next development from the book..........imagine my dismay when it was poem after poem of un-related prose...well I never got to past the fourth page as I was just disappointed. No good...no good at all !! Wouldnt mind my money back actually.....
3,Soulful and Sassy,"JUSTICE Just Us Just Me is Mary Morrison's sexy, sassy, and straight-forward collection of poems. Ms. Morrison's speaks to the heart and soul of men and women everywhere. She treats the audience to an uncensored, uninhibited, and unlikely expedition of the human spirit."
5,Great Pre-Shave Face Scrub!,"I have been using this product prior to shaving for the last couple of months, and it works very well. It softens the facial hair prior to applying shave cream, and shaving. This results in a very close shave, with no irritation to the skin. I have found that I don't get anymore ingrown hairs too."
4,A good textbook,"Good format and coverage of issues with personal stories included with research. A nice reference to have for students, or parents looking for guidance."
4,Awesome Book,"This book is a great collection of essays discussing sex, gender and the ideologies that encompass the American mentality of sexuality."
3,Some Issues,"I received the book in great time; however, I was expecting a new book in great condition. The cover of the book seemed to be sliced and when I looked at the inside cover, there was tape holding it together. Not exactly what I ordered."
5,Good Quality/Fast Delivery,"I bought this hair clip as a costume piece for my daughter. I ordered it and recieved it in the time frame I was estimated. (Other items,from different companies through Amazon,took way longer!) I was very happy with the size and quality of the hair piece. I was also very happy with the delivery. If you like dragonflies or want to use it for a Coraline costume this is great! There was also a colored one available."
5,Sturdy and functions very well,"I worried about not getting one of the main names that I knew, but I needed the 4 bike capacity and the price was great. We run our own straps to either side of our trunk (wrap around the trunk hinges easily) to prevent side to side wobbling. We have used it lots for the last year and would recommend it to our friends! It has really nice rubber tie-downs and the frame is sturdy, and easy to attach, raise and lower."
3,A flawed but useful book,"Firstly, Martin Evening is a Photoshop wizard. Unfortunately he has difficulty conveying his knowledge. Reading this book is a bit like listening to an expert mumbling away to himself about his field of expertise. You have to strain to glean the information, but it is there nevertheless. Furthermore, he has assumed an odd starting position of the reader. He assumes you have years of experience with commercial printing, and that you are familiar with older versions of Photoshop. He wastes too much space explaining how things used to work in previous versions. This book will not teach you Photoshop. Learn Photoshop (read the Adobe manual), become a power user, and then read this book (a few times to make sense of it)."
4,I will buy the next improved edition.,"I very much wanted to buy this book but the remarks made by ""donf@intercall.net from New Jersey, USA , October 2, 1998 "" specially Remarks 2,3 and 4 have me put off from this book. Perhaps the next edition might be improved one."
2,Hot Blonde,"This is another terrible attempt at a thriller. We have seen these characters a million times. The lead actors performance was terribly weak. I saw it on late night T.V. as did some of the other reviewers did. The only redeeming quality of the the film is the incredibly ""Hot Blonde Actress"" (...). She was worth staying up for. (...)."
4,Magical,"This was magical to read, such a beautiful, heartfelt story. I love the way the Hubble telescope is described - it's hard to put into words for me how much I love this book; I strongly recommend you read this author's words."
5,"Body as a Comodity? ""Human Body Shop"" $$$ For our parts","You really need to read this. It is an important book about bio-ethics. It is out of date, but it still is really important. The reason it is out of date is that it needs to continue onward. I purchase this book and have my friends read it. They are shocked when they read it. It is really important that you know this information. This is about your life and your body and improtant issues that were just glossed over by society. Do you realize the value of your DNA and your organs in money terms? Is that correct ethically that our body means dollars??? Who gets these organs? Is it really random? What do they do with a placenta after a human gives birth? This is your personal property and look what is being done with it.Super Stimulating Non Fiction read."
4,Some good songs here...,"CD will sound dated to many since it has an 80s flavor to it butif you like Starship, Foreigner or Survivor, you will like this CD. Kevin Chalfant's work with the STORM and TWO FIRES is betterbut this CD still warrants a listen."
4,"Excellent reference, well worth the price","well laid out book with good explanations and examples,includes code examples on the cd as well as the sdk. I especially enjoyed the section on creating dynamic data structures using class modules. Section on the windows API has covers some of the vba functions compared to the API equivalent and lists how the functions differ. Section on the registry was very helpful to me."
4,Um bom livro um tanto maudo,Embora tenha gostado do livro acho um pouco maudo e com uma leitura um pouco chata. Cobrindo bastante bem as classes e algumas API's.É sempre bom ter um livro desses na pratilheira.
2,Not reader-friendly/kid friendly,"I was disappointed by this book and its sequel, ""More Baby's First Signs"". The illustrations were dark and dull and would not engage a baby's attention. There were also very few words actually shown in each book. For an intro to baby sign language, I'd recommend My First Signs by Annie Kubler. It's fantastic!"
1,Left Much To Be Desired,"At a glance, these looked like cute board books to use when teaching a baby to sign but I must say, the illustrations are just plain awful! I think my toddler could draw better pictures! Other than that, the book covers a fairly good number of signs but is definitely NOT a book I'd recommend or spend any money purchasing. It also seems all the titles by this particular author employ the same illustrator so be careful."
4,One of the best indy rock bands of the 80's,"I saw the Del Fuegos in Manchester, NH during their tour with the Georgia Satellites and Tom Petty, for their second or third album. They were hands down one of the best indy rock bands of the 1980's. They toured with Petty when he was hitting the big time, kind of like when the Meat Puppets toured with Nirvana. They put on a smokin' good show, true blue rockers. This is American music."
2,Superfluous Stuff,"IMHO, the tracks from their album, ""Boston, Mass"" are the only ones worth listening to. Save time and just buy that stellar, 5-star disc."
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed. The earbuds hurt my ears, pinched to tight without anyway to adjust. I could hear well for a second and then it would pinch so tight into my ears that it would cut off all sound. I also ended up with a bad earache by the end of my shift."
4,great scope for the money,"I hear much better with this scope than my old Ever Dixie. I can't warn people enough to stay away from the Ever Dixie brand. Fisher Price honestly makes considerably better working scopes. The Prestige is great though. Not too heavy, it has a dot so you know if you are using the diaphragm or bell, and most importantly, it works well! I'm still mastering getting Blood pressures (that is on me and not the scope I think), but I can hear lung sounds great. I recommend this scope."
3,"OK stethoscope, bad eartips","This is not a bad stethoscope (I actually like it quite a bit), but the rubber eartips are of poor quality. I used both sets (it comes with 2 sets of the eartips) within first few months. They had cracked and fell apart (as if the rubber was too old and dry). Amazon customer service did not do anything for it and redirected me to the Prestige medical customer Service. I tried to contact Prestige medical several times with no luck, but eventually they responded. They offered free eartip replacement. Will see how long this set lasts."
5,Better than my classmates Littman,"I bought this because of the reviews and I wasn't disappointed. I am a nursing student and most of the class have Littman, mine beats most of them."
1,Garbage,Just don't do it. I bought one- returned it earpeices defective. Had another sent to me. Ear peiced defective again. Had to go to university bookstore and by Litmann earpeices. Drum is also defective- tympanic membrane falls off. All and all this is a very poor scope. I would not recommend it.On the positive side- I have had several good scopes stolen- if this gets stolen- who cares. i feel sorry for the thief.ER doctor.
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I bought this product based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The stethoscope, itself, is not bad. I work in an ambulance in a very busy system and use it dozens of times a day. Lung sounds are audible, but not as loud as my Littman (Classic II, not cardiology).The rubber ring around the bell also keeps falling off, not sure why it does that, but very annoying to fumble with your stethoscope in front of a patient!Overall, it is worth the money and I am happy with my purchase, I just wouldn't say it is the best stethoscope I have owned."
3,"OK quality, poor earpieces","I'm a primary care doc, so my stethoscope definitely gets a workout. I find the sound quality adequate. My only complaint is the soft earpieces. They are made of inferior material, and they split, tear, and work their way loose. I need to replace them often."
3,Bug book,Not as detailed as I would have liked it to be. Pictures are great but lack specific classification so I can find any spider I come in counter with.
2,It's not about bugs...,"This book has some nice pictures and interesting stories, but it's not a bug book, it's an organic gardening book. Wish I had known that, because although I think organic gardening is wonderful, I'm not a gardener. I just wanted to learn about Texas bugs! Was that too much to ask?"
5,My Kids and Our Bugs,"When my two and four year olds starting bringing me bugs from outside, I decided it was time to determine if they were harmful. This book had excellent photographs that helped me identify the bugs. I used it as an educational tool for my two little bug hunters. I am happy to report we have had no dangerous bugs gathered."
1,Disappointed in Universal Lighting and Decor lamp,"Stopped working after using less than 1 year. For the price, very dissatisfied. Based purchase on reviews and obviously did not fare as well as other purchasers."
4,Beautiful Ring,"I bought a size 10 in this ring awhile back and I really like it alot. The only complaint I have is that with the style of the top part being like it is, it is rather thin. Still it would look funny if it was any thicker. I have had this ring for over a year though and I am satisfied overall with the quality and durability of it. Since I am really hard on all my jewelry, durability is very important to me."
2,elton's first,"Elton John's new cd, was alright. His single ""Iwant Love"" is simply great. I really enjoyed both the melody and the great lyrics, any of us can put our selves into this position. Have fun, and enjoy!"
1,Burned my face and made it red for hours!,"Just a word of warning that this product made my face burn up with a very painful, stinging feeling. Apparently the other users of this product haven't experienced this, but it definitely can be an issue. It happened both yesterday & today, so I am convinced that the product does not work with my skin.Nivea for Men Aftershave Balm, Gillette (any brand line) aftershave balm/gel, and L'Oreal Men's Expert aftershave lotion all have worked quite well for me (without the redness & burning). Neutrogena Men Post Shave Lotion also didn't prevent razor burn or make it go away!"
5,Excellent mixture of practical advice and theory,"I had expected a typical fluff, despite Evensky's fine reputation. I has very surprised at this mixture of practical advice and theory. Pointers are given to other sources for those more theoretically inclined. Some of the practical advice (software recommendations and such) won't age as gracefully as the text itself, these packages will become obsolete before the book. Nevertheless, I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to understand the basics of risk/reward, the importance of asset allocation, and the theoretical material that led to these ideas."
5,A Great Treatise on Wealth Management,"Mr. Evensky's book has had a profound impact on my wealth management philosophy. He is very effective in blending the broad scope of investment management theory with ""real world"", practical application. I found it particularly useful because it is not a book written by an academic who has never sat across the table from a client and held their hand through the good times and the tough. This is a must read for any serious manager of wealth.A. Todd Black, CFP"
2,Magic Potty is OK...but,"I found a couple rather important flaws in the design of this Magic Potty. It seems like it would be great if your child used it as a stand alone leave-it-on-the-floor potty. The problems I've run into all surround the transitional uses. First, the seat slides all over the toilet!! It's rather dangerous and I have to be right there with my very independent daughter to make sure it doesn't slip off the toilet while she tries to get on - which also brings me to the next point. The step stool is WAY too short and the cover doesn't always close securely, which leads to an unsteady step for my child to step onto. We bought this when my daughter was 18 mos. old, she is tall for her age. She is 2 now and this thing is still not tall enough for her to comfortably slide onto the toilet - and forget about reaching the sink to wash her hands!! I am currently looking at other options...I'm sure this would have been great to use just as a floor model, though."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"When this product claims to sport ""100 levels"" - don't believe it. There are actually only 5 levels - the other 95 ""level"" settings merely change the time control. If you change the computer strength, it's only at unlimited time. Very disappointing. I called their tech support and the guy told me, ""Well, you can just handicap the computer by limiting its alloted time."" Pardon me amigo, but time isn't an issue for a computer. A 2200 level computer can move many times in one second while maintaining master level strength. What good is that?"
3,This is certainly NOT one of Karpov's games...,Karpov may have some of his games stored in this chess computer's memory; but I am sure he had little to do with the marketing of this product.Excalibur's display photograph for this set shows the pieces set up in a completely illegal position. Kind of a slap in the face for Mr. Karpov. Buy with caution.
4,Satisfied customer,I am very pleased with the Excalibur Electronics 747K Grand Master chess game... The challenge that I have understands all of the options the game gives you!
3,Not all I expected,"This particular product might be too small for the average car. I dried my VW Jetta with it, and think a bigger one would have been better. Mazybe this size is good as a backup or to detail-dry smaller areas.The product itself does what it says it does - streak-free drying."
2,The Big Letdown.,"The subtitle overstates the significance of this book (A Scientific Discovery That Revolutionizes the Way We View the Origin of Life, the Water We Drink, etc). The Big Splash is very technical and , for those of us without a Doctorate in Geophysics it is quite a dry read. The references to the Space Program and the human elements that show the competition and back-stabbing that goes on in the scientific community are more interesting and help to move you to the end of the story, but, this is little solice for the feeling of being let down at the conclusion (or lack thereof) at the end of the book. Unfortunately, this book is probably the best you can find on the topic, though. I guess you cannot expect every scientific story to be a great read. If you need the data and answers to questions you can find in this book (like I did), you probably won't find it anywhere else. Grab a cup of strong coffee."
4,Doesn't hurt cracked teeth!,"This is the only whitening I can find that doesn't hurt to apply. I have micro cracks in my teeth and the peroxide ones (Crest, Colgate, etc) hurt my teeth. I tried this and it works without pain."
3,Not well cast,"Better looking than a nail, but the execution is sloppy. I've had similar pins in the past with much finer metal work -- even for a cheap product. Bottom line: I like the idea, but would look for a different brand in the future."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this history: both in the organisation (it sprawls and is very disjointed in places) and style. I couldn't really believe that the author of City of Gold wrote this. It comes across as the meandering memories of some old buffer. Nevertheless, I learnt a fair amount about WW2 in the process."
4,The Eye of the Professional Analyst,"This book corrects many widely held appreciations. (1) Rommell wasn't a genius, but impetuous and overreaching; much of his success came from reading Allied signals. (2) German generals overcredited the effectiveness of Russian artillery for their defeat. (3) The German campaign in Greece didn't delay invasion of Russia or cost Germany the war. (4) Churchill was vain-glorious. (5) Hitler was taking amphetamines for a heart ailment! Consistent with his theme, Deighton is least forgiving to those who falsified or destroyed records from self-interest. Well researched, and broader in reference than most military history, the book critically evaluates personalities, strategies and key decisions. It is unusual for its point-of-view--the professional intellegence analyst who estimates dispassionately, deleting passion to comprehend reality. A hard-headed contribution to what was done or left undone, and written with skill."
5,A Thematic Approach,"How did I miss this book when it was first published (in 1993)? An excellent book on the subject by an amateur historian. This is not an exhaustive, chronological study -- instead Mr. Deighton looks at major themes and doesn't hesitate to reach back as far as he needs to for causes or amplifying details. One to keep on the bookshelf for continued reference."
3,"Works well, but not really that quiet","This air pump seems well built and works well, but it's really not that quiet. It definitely makes a noticeable buzz. I'll probably build a little foam lined box for it to make it truly quiet."
5,a unique blend of eco-industrial world music,"I first became aware of Didjworks when visiting New York. I walked past Simon7 playing didjeridoo in one of the subway stations, and I'm really glad I bought one of the CDs because they've been difficult to find otherwise -- until now!The distinctive didjeridoo sound lends itself to the haunting music here -- trance patterns overlaid with samples and eco-friendly messages.This is a great chance for you to hear something new and exciting, making the most of the vast resources of the Internet."
3,Not as Smooth as Silke,"This book tells the story of Jim Silke and is very informative, but the quality of the art was less than expected. I have always enjoyed Jim's art and the book is a welcome addition to my collection of fantasy and pinup artists, but I think the publisher does not do the Art due justice."
4,a perfectly woven tapestry of musical styles,"Folk music is alive and well and living in the soul of Ina May Wool.This talented storyteller is not however limited to one color on her musical pallet.She skillfully blends country and blues into a folk background until a beautiful picture can be heard.Like an angel with sharp claws,she lands gently on your ears then grabs hold of you and won't let go until the final note is sung.From the uplifting J'ai Gagne to the maudlin January Thaw,the listener is treated to the grand tour of the records emotional landscape.Dark Star has a cool and haunting melody,Hotwired and Hungry has plenty of bluesy grit as it saunters it's way into your head.With the help of her musical partner and husband Daniel Weiss,Ina May Wool has given us a stunning debut record that leaves us both satisfied yet hungry for more."
1,THERE WAS ONLY ONE DVD IN MY ORDER!!!!!,"This ""double feature"" had only one DVD!! Remains of the Day was not in the factory sealed package--there was only one place for one DVD and it was the sense and sensibility only. I ordered this several months ago but just now opened it. I'm very upset--this has never happened before with Amazon. Word to the wise--even if you're not planning to watch it for awhile, open it as soon as you get it because it is too late for me to return."
4,love Christmas,"We enjoyed this book, however if you are looking for a great Christmas book, check out Are you Grumpy Santa?"
4,Good product,One of the things I love about shopping on Amazon is the convience of it. (Also not having to pay any taxes is also a added plus.)This product works well and I have had no major complaints. It hasn’t knocked my socks off (I am assuming I would have to jump in price for this to happen) but it gets the job done.
2,"Felt clean, but dried my face out completely!","Got so bad that my skin was flaky after use. I have fairly dry skin to begin with, so this clearly was not the best product for me. Too harsh for my skin at least."
2,Might As well use a bar of soap,"I bought this in hopes of having a good daily facial wash that doesn't dry out my skin. This works in the sense that it doesn't dry out your skin, but I haven't seen much improvement in skin texture or clearness. Occasional pimples reoccur just as they have always done on my face (not acne). I think this is as useful as a regular bar of soap, nothing more. I'll have to try something different."
3,just so so product,kinda regret after I received it.oily and stick to my face so I have to wash at least 3 mins to get rid of it.
4,NICE FACE WASH FOR MEN,"CLEANS FACE VERY WELL , NICE SCENT FOR A MAN ,GREAT FOR ACNE! WILL BUY AGAIN!"
2,Uninspiring,"I was going to give this review 1 star, but I figured that it may have skin soothing properties beyond my knowledge and experience. What I have experienced, however, is a real hack job of a shave every time I use this. It almost seems like it doesnt have lubricants. I have no trouble with conventional shave creams."
4,"Very cleansing, not at all oily","I bought this product because it is subscribe-and-save eligible, and because I tend to trust Neutrogena. I've been pleased. Only a small amount goes on really nicely, and the salicylic acid helps clear up acne. Also, I have mild allergies, and have found it to be very non-reactive. I plan to continue using the product."
2,"Over scented, missed the mark","I usually enjoy Neutrogena products but this face wash really missed the mark. The formula included a musk scent intended to make this more of a ""men's"" skin care product. Just because a product is marketed toward a man doesn't mean it has to smell like a forest or wet dog. Also, the fact that it's a face wash and the scent is inches from your nose amplifies the scent. Keep it simple, make it work and you will have happy customers. Get rid of the scent in the future please..."
2,Contains a skin irritant!,"For no apparent reason, the American version of the product contains menthol, which is known to be a skin irritant. This is probably why the product induces redness of the skin rather than preventing it. The similar product I bought in Singapore contained no menthol, had a more solid consistency, did not irritate the skin, and worked excellently."
5,"We passed this book around, and all loved it","I'm a nurse and we always pass our books around to each other. I was third in line to read THE AGREEMENT. I agree with my fellow nurses--I want a man like Garret Lasiter!!! The story kept me turning the pages. It was a well plotted book. If I ever became an author, I want to come back as Constance O'banyon--her talent is awsome. Since reading THE AGREEMENT, I ordered as many of her books as I can find. You can bet they will be passed around the nurse's station. I am not reading Texas Proud and I'm hooked."
3,Not a bad read but not a five star book.,I bought this book because it got such high reviews and have to say I was a bit dissapointed. It was frustrating for me during the whole book that the only thing keeping them apart was a silly misunderstanding. For some reason everyone else seemed to love it. I was expecting to be wowed.
5,I am new to reading--this is my first grownup book. I'm 16,"My mother said I could read her Constance O'banyon books when I got to be sixteen. For the last month, I have been plowing through them and loving every word. Now, I came to The Agreement and I think it's the best book I've ever read. I loved Song of the Nightingale, but this one is awsome. Lauren is the kind of person I'd like to be, and if only I could meet a man like Garret!!!! I can't wait to read Connnie's next book. They have given me the greatest pleasure."
5,Great product,Item delivered quickly and just as beautiful as described - very cooperative on combined shipping
3,"Great Stroll Down Memory Lane, Poor Quality","I've seen better quality on the Disney Channel Reruns of this show. I didn't see any real problems with the first set (Volume One) on dvd, but this latest issue of Volume Three is awful. The sound is unpredictable, up and down and the picture quality is lacking, marred by white flecks and grainy animation throughout the shows. I could live with the bare bones packaging if the dvd quality was better. Shame on Disney for producing shoddy products and not giving us our money's worth."
3,Starting to go down hill from here... but still love the show.,Once they introduce McDuck's super suit hero the show starts to go downhill.. Overall still a very entertaining show and great for families!
