2,damaged book,"It was not in good shape, It smelled like moth balls and the cover looked like a mouse got ahold of it and took a bite of it."
3,Kinda lacked a punch line,The book was sweet and everybody was loving and ambitious. I think this is part of a series because I felt a little lost with the characters. And it just stopped at the end.
5,MEMORIES GALORE HERE,"This is one of the best collections I have ever seen. Not only was the sound and picture perfect, but there are many live appearances shot in England, that we havent seen before here in the U.S. Kudos to "" Reeling In The Years "" I just bought The Hollies dvd made from the same company and wow, its great. You will love the quality and the nice memories it will bring back. I am listening joyfully as I write this review. Keep up the nice work with more of the same."
5,British Invasion,"Reelin' in the Years is the resource for the material in this DVD set. The set contains Dusty Springfield, Herman's Hermits, Small Faces, and Gerry and the Pacemakers. There's a separate DVD produced by the same company that is recommended to make this set complete. This is the definitive retrospective on all five acts and all performances are complete."
2,What Happened?,"I loved Deana Carter's last 2 CD's, and was excited to get ""I'm Just a Girl"", but...what happened? The songs are just flat out disappointing, except for There's No Limit. No surprise that No Limit was the radio single released to hype the CD before it became available. But nothing else on the album sounds like There's No Limit. The first song, ""I'm Just a Girl"", is okay - but pretty bubblegum poppish and she keeps singing about a back seat in a Corvette - doesn't exist! (Just a mild annoyance.) The third track, ""You and Tequila"" is a downer, but Matraca Berg has songwriting credit here so it's good. The album falls apart after the first 3 songs. Some of it is truly unbearable (""Girls Night Out"") but most is just forgettable. Hope her next effort is back up to speed."
3,Deana Carter- I'm Just a Girl,"Good Album. Favorite song on this album is ""There's No Limit"". This song is one I'll put on all my country compilations I burn for the forseeable future."
2,Not so good!,"I really liked the songs there's no limit and I'm just a girl but the rest of the cd is crap. She definately is not a true country singer (she listens to rap music, stated in an interview). One reviewer stated that the cd has a video of there's no limit, this is untrue. One of the reasons I bought this cd was because I thought the video was on it. Not so! If you like a variety of music you may like it, but if you are a true country fan like me I believe you will be let down."
1,Am I the only one??,"Who finds this album completely REVOLTING. I am not one to judge a country artist for exploring their pop sensibilities....but at least make it good pop music. Come On, Deana!! I know you can do better than this. I hope this is the record label's idea of a good album, cause if this is truly reflective of Deana's talent's, she's going nowhere fast. The songwriting is one-dimensional and though her voice is unique, it can become irritating if you listen to more than two songs in a row. If you're a fan of garbage, go and pick this album up because you'll love it. Those of you looking for quality music, stay away from this album. I am giving ""Im Just A Girl"" one star, for the one stand-out track on the album, ""Goodbye Train"""
3,Almost but not quite,"I found the information and the slant of this book both useful but it didn't supply enough information. It might be retitled Where men may retire. The descriptions seem to stress activities as golf and fishing, which to my mind are more male activities. I would have liked more extensive information about cultural activities and availabilty of libraries. These are touched on but not in enough detail. The bulk of retirees are women and their needs differ from men and couples. More information on specialized services, such as public transporation,would be desireable. The of attitudes of native residents is touched on but not in depth. My experience with some of these areas has been very negative.Over all this book is a very good place to start. It deals with areas that are not normally thought of as retirement destinations. Weather, housing prices and taxes are often described. The author also provides addesses for more infomation. Websites would have been helpful."
1,Empty jar of pickles,"This is a book written on a shoestring. A book which provides less factological information than 20 years old yellow pages....I particulary enjoyed reading about selected places, where the author even did not mention cost of real estate, but mentioned that general Sherman was there and burned it. If someone really retires by this book, then the consequences must be tragic. To find places which have more 70% of the total population retired from elsewhere, and minimum house cost $200,000 one perhaps does not need a book for ($)...."
1,This guy thinks too much of himself.,"The author apparently makes a living out of writing one retirement book after another and constantly revising those already written. This in itself wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact most of the information presented is less than thorough and comprehensive, and in many cases it is downright misleading. Buy it if you must but don't expect too get much useful information from it."
2,Is This for Real,"How does a 10 inch by 16 inch by 6 inch piece of vinyl cover the front end of a Camaro. It is advertised as a Front End Cover, but exactly what is it you cover?"
3,As expected.,"Installation was simple enough, just make sure to have product well heated and laid out for a while out of the package first. Unfortunately I found the same problem I find with most bras in that you need to make a few modifications to the vehicle to get it on. In this case, the gap from the hood to the bumper must be increased to allow the hood to close after install."
5,Soooooooo much fun,"I first saw this toy at a play group where my 10 month old son played with it for a bit. Once he got the idea of crawling through the tunnels he loved it. I came home and ordered a set for ourselves. Firstly, this is by far the best price for this set anywhere and secondly, we have sooooooo much fun with it. My son loves crawling through the tunnel and playing peek-a-boo. My husband and I will often play with him and we all have a great time. I am so glad I bought this set and would recommend it for new crawlers and up. The other good thing is that you don't need to set up all the pieces up to play with it. Right now we use only one tunnel most of the time and occasionally bring out another tunnel and the center piece. I can't wait to take it outside in the summer. As my son gets older we'll use more pieces so it can grow with him. No fancy bells and whistles, just plain old fun for everyone."
4,Gift for an 18mth old,"We bought this for my 18mth old son. The kids love it! Even my 9, 8, 6 and 2 year olds love it too. We have it set up in our basement and they play hide and seek in it. It does disconnect at the seams because there are no ties or velcros to hold it together. For the most part, it was worth the money."
2,"Great concept, poor quality","I purchased this item for my ten month old son who loves to crawl around, through, and over everything these days. He loved it, but we had to return it in just a few days as many seams in all four tunnels were coming unstitched, exposing the metal bands and leaving hanging bits of thread everywhere. It was just coming apart at many of its seams. Like others, we were disappointed that the tunnels just sit in the hub and do not attach with Velcro or a snap connector. Judging by some of the other comments, this manufacturer may have a quality control issue."
1,Software Won't Install,"Don't buy this. The company is clearly going out of business and all the products should be recalled. The software doesn't load, AT ALL! I've since gone to review comments left on this company's other products and it seems the software for those products don't install either.Good luck if you go this route.:("
3,Alternative hymnal,"This is an alternative hymnal introduced by ELCA and ELCiC in the late 90's. It contains a few traditional Lutheran hymns the Lutheran Book of Worship skipped. It also has several Spanish-language and African hymns. There are a fair number of ""praise songs""--contemporary Christian songs of varying quality. An unusual feature is a number of Taize hymns."
5,Chicago White Sox World Series Baseball Cards,"I am a huge fan. These cards were hard to find, especially years after their championship, yet I found them easily on Amazon and they were an excellent price!"
4,A Trip into the Soul of dUg,"This is one of those albums that doesn't grab you on the first listen, but doesn't let you go after the third! The songs on this disc are a bit experimental at times and very creative and soulful. Songs like ""Crashing"", ""Are You Gonna Come"", and ""Zepp"" could fit in easily on a King's X record while other tracks like ""Equal Rights"" and ""Change"" find dUg treading new ground with acoustic and slide guitar. The drum tracks on this album are played phenomenally well by Joy Gaskill, son of King's X drummer Jerry. This is a must for all dUg Pinnick fans and for anyone interested in something straight from the soul."
3,This Is Lacking,"The P-Funkish ""O-H-I-O"" and the pulsing synthfunk of""Body Vibes"" are two of the bands best tunes.But The soft soultitle song?How come the band can't sing it?They usually can andat any rate this was released around the same time as the'Saturday Night Fever' soundtrack and had a hard time competingwith the disco avelance smothering popular music at the time.Another great album cover anyway 'Angel' is bogged down with too much filler and besides,it's best songs can be foundelsewhere.Better look for the very highly underrated 'Mr.Mean'album of the same vintage,whitch has much stronger materialthroughout.But this is strangly,sadly-stagnant."
3,send me down an angel,weak except for angel and that's lest interesting then previous songs o.h.i.o. was okay but who's doing that awful sir nose impresssion.
3,Fire Going Out,"The Players had made four classic albums prior to this. Although this one has it's moments (The lovely ballad title cut ""Angel"", the hot and funky ""Body Vibes"" is one of thier best songs ever and the sweaty funk of ""O-H-I-O"" is hot) there were signs of desperation (""Merry-Go-Round"" is a poor attempt to recapture thier Love Rollercoaster glory days). Still this is probably worth the price for the three cuts mentioned, but there isn't too much else here. Actually thier next release ""Jass-Ay-Lady"" is not even in print anymore. That was more of the same as this, several good cuts, more filler. Maybe the best cuts of the two should be combined or have them package together as two for the price of one. Just a suggestion."
4,Another funky OP classic.,"The Ohio Players continued right on into the late 70's with another tight funky recording with this title album. It may not match the success of ""Honey, Fire or Skin Tight"", but it's still a keeper. One thing is for sure, this group always had a knack for having beautiful women gracing the cover of their lp's back in the day. And this album was living proof of it. If you are a true OP fan, then you will cop this one along with the earlier material that they recorded. This album is on point as well."
4,Great Resource,"I have a friend who is pregnant and needs massage therapy. I'm still in school for my licence but am practicing at home as I go through school. I bought this video tape to learn how to massage while keeping her comfortable and not hitting those pressure points I've heard about that can cause contractions. I learned a lot of really good techniques and there is a lot of good streching involved in this tape. I didn't use everything I learned in the video, but the table set up, posturing and foot and leg massages were what really did the trick. I'll warn you - the tape is DRY! Nothing exciting about the way these two people present. That is why it doesn't get 5 stars.Overall - my friend/client was comfortable the entire time, felt fully relaxed and stretched when the massage was complete. I would reccommend this video. The proof is in the work and a happy client and I had a great expereince with that!"
2,Disappointed,"I am a pregnancy massage therapist and was excited when I saw this DVD being sold. I would imagine that the instructors would focus more on techniques. But when I watched it, I was disappointed that the bulk of the content was not technique related. Some of the techniques seemed a little rough to perform on the client. I'm not sure how my clients will take to it. A much better DVD is the one by Leslie Stager."
5,ears to hear,"Kelley Varner has done his homework in this book. It is a watershed work for correctly understanding Bible prophecy. In view of orthodoxy, intellectual honesty, and spiritual truth, those who question the major points and premise of this volume, should themselves be questioned when all sides of these issues are clearly viewed. The author has no axe to grind and is not poised to build a kingdom on his theology or writing gift. The winds of popularity are not blowing this vessel into the port of the accolades and celebration of the multitudes. He is sailing through what appears to be a narrow channel but in reality is navigating a course through the River of Life. It examines and communicates what the Spirit of God has revealed to him as he endeavors to effectively share words of Truth. Any serious and honorable student of Bible prophecy will want to thoroughly study and digest this treatise."
3,I did not investigate enough before getting this!,"My son realy wanted this, becouse my brother has one. I use the 60CSX however and did not research enough before buying the one he wanted. This is a very good kit. Good price and exceptional quality. However none of my computers have RS-232 ports. I did not to think about looking at the connector, becouse I am so use to mine having USB. So I spent $50 and got the adapter, this did not help alot though. We can see the device almost every time, but most of the time it will fail its data uploads. So far I have not come up with a good solution. Once you do get it to upload however it works well. It does not get good reception in the woods or near cliffs, but this is to be expected with the older antenas. So If they would fix the connection problems (PC to GPS) I would rate this 4 stars. If you have an older computer you should not have these problems, just make sure you have RS-232."
1,A pity its all fantasy,If you search wikipidia you will see that Marlo Morgan has faked the story. She has admitted this publically. It is offensive to the aborinal people of Australia.
5,THIS is the first review??!,"This CDs been out forever, well I'll fill you in. Ahh, a gorgeous collage of serial killers. This just screams metal. This is THRASH. From ex-At the Gates members comes the Haunted. This CD offers a wide variety of songs. Under the Surface and Hollow Ground give the in-flaes sound with tasteful clean vocals nand death metal mix, while still mainting the heaviness. For people with heavier tastes, Victim Iced and Revelation are played at light speed. These guys know how to play. Dark Intentions is the opening, instrumental track (which was actually made thought up in 5 minutes). nonetheless, very good choice to open it up with. Fans of Arch Enemy, At the Gates, Soilwork, In Flames, and maybe Children of BOdom fans should love this."
3,A mediocre supplement,"On the overall, Jade and Steel is not bad, but remains a deceiving d20 game supplement. The layout is mediocre, and most illustrations are photos which have got filter work with photoshop (or similar). There are some descriptions of ancient China, its religion and philosophy, etc., but you can get more of this with many a good history book. There are six new (more or less interesting) prestige classes, but if you have the Oriental Adventures book, you already have enough. Then, there is a scenario for 11th-14th level characters.My opinion is, that if you intent to play an Oriental Adventure campaign set in a land more similar to ancient China rather than Rokugan, you may buy this supplement. However, you cannot base your setting on this booklet only."
3,"I wouldn't say these are ""Easy-to Make,"" so change the title!","Let's just start with one fact - I do not consider myself an idiot. However, if the title of this book holds true, I will have to reevaluate this belief. I am at a loss as to why this book is described as ""Easy-to Make"" when the instructions are scant and less than clear, the materials needed are hard to find and the projects take hours to execute. Plus, it takes some advance planning for things like ""soaking the bamboo in boiling water"" over night. Yes, the results will be impressive (if you follow through completion), but don't try to fool people into thinking they can gather the family for an impromptu kite-making-and-flying on a Saturday afternoon. It will be a weekend project (plus any time required to find the materials or substitutions)and it will take some effort and frustration. Do some yoga before starting. That being said, I am attempting to follow though on one project and will report on the result some time later."
2,Isn't his best work,I don't like this CD..... I wouldn't of got it if I knew how much it suck. Don't waste your money
5,Intro to Vascular Ultrasonography 5th ed.,"Exactly the reference I needed!!! As a general sonographer looking for a thorough vascular reference book, I needed something that I could keep in my library for future reference yet use as a study tool for the vascular registry. I felt this book was exactly what I was looking for. I know plenty of vascular techs who start their careers with this book and feel it is essential to any vascular tech's library."
5,Vascular Ultrasound,"Wow, this company was quick!It came within a week and it was in prestine condition.Would definitely order from them again.Thanks!Jenna"
4,Burnout 2 - still fun,"Still lots of fun to play on the original Xbox -- requires more skill (to build up the Burnout bar) compared to Burnout 3 and 4. This one is much more about near-misses and sliding than the follow-up games in the series, which are more about Teh Insane SPEED...A big difference with this one (#2) is that if you let go of the A button (Burnout speed) before it runs out, you have to build it back up to Full again before you can use it -- Burnout 3 has speed-boost-on-demand.Slower paced overall, which makes it a good choice over BO:Revenge(#4 in the series) - for parents who want to race as well ;-)Burnout 2 - I recommend it for family entertainment. Also got my girlfriend into Xbox racing with this title :-)"
2,Could be better,"I just felt that the graphics and action could be better in this game. I've seen other racing games(for the X-box) where the instant replay almost looks real.There is a crash mode but once you resume the race, your car is back to normal again. After 20 minutes of playing I had mastered all 3 of the courses that it offers as far as racing. There are more levels in the crash mode but it's almost the same thing over and over.I would suggest renting this game before buying it. If I had bought it first I would have taken it back and gotten a refund !!"
4,Good cornet mouthpiece,"Good mouthpiece at a great price. It is comparable to a Bach 3c at about half the price. There are not a lot of cornet mouthpieces out there, but if you're looking for this size, you won't be disappointed."
2,Fun movie..too bad disc is bad!,"My family and I saw Wall-e at the theater and wanted the DVD as soon as it came out. Unfortunately the disc is defective and will not play on my system without constant freeze-ups. This does not happen with any other DVD's. Sadly, I'm going to go through the refund/return process. My two star on the movie is my frustration with the disc, not the movie itself. Wall-e is one of the cutest little animated characters produced. Some might call the film a message movie, I don't think that's the primary point. A case can be made for most animated films having some kind of message, it's all how/why you want to see it. Be a kid again, then watch these kinds of movies!"
2,3-disc version defective,"The first set of 3-disc dvds to be sold were defective. The disc containing the movie would not play on older dvd players, only on HD dvd players. In order for it to be seen that week, I just went out and bought the single disc version at walmart while they were on sale. The two bonus discs worked ok."
4,"Movie great, streaming not so great!",I had a hard time trying to get it to download to my kindle and ended up showing my son on the computer. That was not what I wanted.
3,Packaging was completely destroyed!!,I bought this for a gift for my daughter. I couldnt even wrap it because the package was completely tore apart. I took the dvd out and put it in another box for her to open. I was completely disappointed in the way this package arrived.
5,Great for all ages,My fiance and I loved this movie - and we didn't even have kids with us - it was very cute and thoughtful and good for all ages.
3,Good price,It was a good price for what I received. The packing could have been much better so that the case arrived in better condition. The case is crushed and not reshapable so we put it in another dvd case. The disc was fine fortunately.
5,Maybe the best movie ever made,"The title of this review is misleading. What I meant to say was that it could be the best first half of the movie ever made. While the second half is merely good, the first half is absolutely brilliant, incredible, wonderful!"
4,Enjoyable,I ordered Wall-E on a recommendation from a friend and glad I did. Good little movie with a big picture moral message for mankind with out getting preachy about it.
1,"Don't buy this if it's a surprise--the packaging has ""Wall-E"" all over it!","The movie is great, but Amazon packages it in a mailer that says ""Wall-E"" in three different places! It also says ""Disney"" all over it, so I guess it's great for promotion, but I can think of reasons that buyers would not want the contents of their Amazon mailers labeled with what's inside. Guess whose kids figured out a Christmas present when they got the mail today?"
1,A wholeheartedly miserable experience,"It to my complete bewilderment that this film has gotten the praise that it is. I have enjoyed every Pixar film I have seen, until this monstrosity. If I tend to use the word ""torture"" frequently in my descriptions, it doesn't even come close to conveying how much I suffered trying to make it through the movie. Honestly, I should have walked out, but I kept expecting the pace and plot to pick up..it never did. This film is about as tedious as it gets.Imagine hearing two robotic, mentally-challenged voices repeating ""WALL-E"" and ""E-VA"", NON-STOP, over and over again...for what seems like 4 hours. I've just summed up ""Wall-E"" for you. That's it. That's the whole movie. Nothing more to see here. Anyone who wants to attach some pseudo-inspirational context to this mess...I advise that this is time wasted."
1,BORING !,"What A Dud ! Save your money for now and Buy the Movie ""UP"" this fall!! You'll watch UP more times than this WALL-E bore."
1,worst pixar movie ever!,Am I the only one that thinks this movie is absolutely horrible! It is extremely boring and does not have a clear direction. It skips from one boring scene to another. I'm actually not even finished watching it yet... my family is still in the other room. I had to leave because I was so bored. We're about an hour into it.
2,DRM??? No wonder they offer the digital copy,"The movie skips and doesn't play on my computer. However, it plays on my friends DVD players but not computers. Did my research and this movie holds yet another example of DRM. Thinking on returning to Amazon since I didn't rent it. Big dissapointment to see this things on great movies. Guess I'll go back to only renting.Other than that, the movie deserves an oscar."
5,Wonderful!,This movie is one of the best from Pixar! It is lovely and has a great message. A must see!
5,Almost perfect movie,The first 1/3 of the movie (before Wall-E meets people on the ship) is perfect - a masterpiece. The second 1/3 is a very good movie. The last third is perfect as well.
5,Great movie,This is a fabulous movie for adults as well as children. There is a wonderful message for all of us if we are open to hearing and seeing it.
4,My son loved it!,I enjoyed this movie with my son when it first came and he was happy when I purchased for him on DVD.The DVD did skip at one point but he did not mind too much; this why I am giving it four stars.
3,Wall-E in Spanish,It's a great condition but the price... it seems not a reasonable price.. it is kind of a little experience.overall is all good.
4,Wall-e,"I first saw this movie at a friend's house and knew right away I had to have a copy. This is about the cutest movie that I've seen in a long time. You'll really feel for Wall-e as he persues the love of his life in a sweet, clumsy way that is actually believable. Top notch animation, and some really funny moments make this movie a winner."
3,Digital Copy Requires Computer to have DVD player,"I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the movie, lots of other reviewers have done that better than I could. I just wanted to be sure it was mentioned that if you buy the 3 disc special edition copy that you know the digital copy requires you to have a dvd drive in your computer. We bought Journey to the Center of the Earth that came with the digital copy. You just put it in the cd drive of the computer and you downloaded the movie from a web page to your computer. Wall-E however, requires you to have a dvd drive. This was not mentioned when I read the description (or maybe I missed it) but now I paid extra money for something I can't use. So, I wanted to spare someone else out there with an old computer that wants to watch this on their system the same experience. Hope it helps someone."
1,What a disappointment!,"We can't play this Blu-Ray on our player! We can see the trailers, the bonus features, and other assorted ""who cares"" options, but not the movie itself. The only good thing is that we purchased this for our son for Christmas and, for some reason, it does play on his player, at his home. At least someone has been able to see the movie."
3,Decent,"I have to say that, honestly, I do not think that this one is quite all that. It is a nice, heartwarming film, and an impressive feat of creating a feature-length presentation out of a little robot. However, I would never imagine ranking this among the great animated films of all time, which is what I keep seeing other people doing. The human scenes felt a bit visually incongruous (relative to the robot-focused bulk of it) to me, for whatever that is worth. I think that Wall-E is definitely worth a watch, but not five stars."
3,I cannot notice the difference between blue ray and dvd...,"I was expecting more quality image definition, but unfurtenately blue looks like dvd!! it's no to much the resolution quality..."
4,WALL-E a pleasant surprise,WALL-E was a surprisingly good movie with a (none too subtle) message and heart. In spite of the unusual hero I found myself routing for WALL-E and his fellow robots. WALL-E is worth adding to your collection.
3,Sad,"This movie was a sad. wall-e is a robot (the only actual living thing on earth) and the eva comes. she trys to find life and wall-e gives her a plant so she leaves and it can be sad because wall-e shuts down twice and it's sad other reasons too. there are better films, but it's better than some.........................."
4,GOOD PIC BUT MORE ADULTISH,Very differant than I thought it would be.. more adult than expected.. enjoyed the picture but like other animated movies better... nice watch... would love to see everyone elses opinion...
4,Brill,"This film was very clever, ejoyed it very much. Great to watch with all the family. Hope you enjoyed as much as I did."
5,Great film worth buying,"I don't buy DVDs that often but I HAD to buy WALL*E since it was such a wonderful, moving film. I cried 2 times in the theater release of this film and did the same when watching at home. Call me an old softie, but I loved this film. Definitely a good buy at this price!"
5,Cute movie,"The seller sent this out promptly. Package was a little dented in route, but DVD arrived in good condition. Enjoyed this movie on television and decided to buy a copy for myself. It's a cute movie for adults and kids alike."
5,Adorable movie,Adorable movie!! Highly recommend. Great message and adorable characters. Great for any age. Getting a combo pack (Bluray and DVD) made this a great deal.
2,walle blu ray with digital copy,Blu ray was in great shape. Very disappointed overall because I wanted the digital copy. It was missing the code for the digital copy. You cannot get a new code unless you have the original receipt. I feel this was wrong to advertise this blu ray as having a digital copy.
4,"Very good movie, but lacks the Disney ""magic""...","After all the hype, I was expecting a monumental Disney classic. I had pre-ordered two months ago and was anxiously waiting to see this, but the first time I watched it I was rather disappointed that the magic I have been used to for 60 years just wasn't there. That is where I found Wall-E to be lacking.Far too many individuals have taken offense at the gratuitous ecological message that plays throughout the entire movie, but I have to laugh at that idea...sure, the trash piles are larger than the sky scrapers, but the message I got was an extreme exagaration rather than a harsh warning.Wall-E is an entertaining modern cartoon with a story, but if you are looking for this to be a classic, nooo. I've watched it twice since, and it does grow on you, but don't expect that warm fuzzy feeling like in earlier Disney classics..."
4,A fun film!,"Full of beautifully-done scenes, Wall-E is fun to watch. The subtle things done with portraying the robots in this film made them sympathetic characters in their own right, especially when it came to Wall-E and EVE. The plot revolves around the last trash-compacting robot still operational on Earth following a mass exodus from the planet. It meets another robot, a highly-advanced machine left on Earth for a mysterious purpose.The voicework is good and I really enjoyed the film and the short included on the DVD."
5,Wall_e,So this movie in the theater and liked it. Bought this to have a personal copy. I always buy a dvd of movies that I like.
5,Great story and quality,"I bought this for the quality of the soundtrack which was supposed to be great on surround sound. So really, came for the sound and video, stayed for the story. Pixar at it's best, in my opinion."
4,Great movie,"Great movie. It took a little longer coming than expected, but I had pre-ordered so I guess I should have known better. Also the packaging wasn't so great. Flimsy paper packaging."
5,So Stinking Adorable!!!!,"I'm a sap when it comes to little innocent love stories, I love Wall-E. Awesome movie"
3,"5 star for movie, no star for miserable long loading time","Ater being bombarded instantly with tons of Disney previews (in glorious Blu-ray pictures and Digital soundtracks), you end up...waiting...and waiting...and waiting...and a white funny circle spinning...hypnotizing...NOT FUNNY! I thought my machine hangs, so I rebooted, BIG MISTAKE! more waiting...and the same not funny circle circling...Get me out of here,I just want to watch a movie, don't give me all the interactive craps to play with! I had to apologize to my wife profusely because I wanted to show off my new HT system. Disney, you ARE the mean witch in your cartoon movie!!!"
3,Wall-E,"The disc came in a sealed box, but when we opened it we could not get it to play. We eventually tried washing it with soap and water, and that is how we finally got it to play. The movie itself is very well done, we especially like the graphics and the story line is thought provoking."
3,expected more,This movie was very slow & I guess I expected more talking from Wall-E!!But it did have a happy ending........
4,Plot Deja Vu,"I loved the movie, but I've seen the story before in Idiocracy with Luke Wilson.In Wall-E, in the future, the earth is covered with trash, all living plants are gone, BUY N' LARGE is the big-box store that contributed to the problem, humans reverted to obese blobs on a huge space ship with every craving served by robots. Wall-E was the last remaining trash compactor.In Idiocracy. in the future, the earth is covered with trash, all living plants are gone, COSTCO is the big-box store that contributed to the problem, humans reverted to urban slang drinking man-made energy drinks. Luke Wilson is the victim of a military time-machine experiment gone wrong.Maybe there is a limit to Science Fiction plots."
5,graphically amazing,"This movie was fantastic, and on blu-ray all of it's splendor really comes out. Simply beautiful"
4,Great Movie - Possibly a Bad disc,My kids love the movie and it is great. The only problem is that it seems to freeze for a few seconds on one of the scenes in space. I think the disc might be bad as it is a brand new Sony BDP-S550 player. Have seen other reports of this. Maybe the movie has too much DRM.
5,can't get enough,I just absolutely love these kind of movies that Pixar has been coming out with lately. Even though it's a few years old this movie rocks and is guaranteed to spark emotions in you that you thought you could never feel about robots.
5,Wall-E,"I know there is a lot of controversy out there about this movie. A lot of people do not like the way that they portrayed humans in the movie. I think the realization that our country could turn into something like that is entirely possible, and way too scary for some people to handle. My kids liked it, but at 2 and 5 did not get the complexity or the moral of the story.My son especially liked the movie since there wasnt a lot of talking in it. It was almost like watching those old Tom & Jerry cartoons, where there isnt a lot of talking, just sounds.My husband liked it a lot too. So its one of those movies that really does appeal to all ages. I give it a thumbs up."
5,"If you're in the mood for a superb light hearted adventure, this is it.","I hadn't heard much about Wall-E going into it which was great because it turned out to be very different then what i was expecting, in a good way. I'm not a huge fan of Pixar, but they did a great job on this one. I don't want to give any of the story away, just rest assured, if you're in the mood for a fun movie this one has something for kids and adults alike. My only complaint doesn't have to do with the actual movie at all but the packaging it comes in, on the box it claims to be environmental friendly packaging, but what common sense tells you is that Disney is just being cheap. It's not your standard dvd case, it's more of a cardboard foldout. Again, this is a minor complaint, the important part about what you're buying is the actual movie and that's top notch. Give it a try whether you buy it or rent it, see it and enjoy!***I haven't seen the dvd extra's yet, i'll update this review once i do***"
4,Wall E Movie,Great movie for all ages. Some detail lacking in the video considering it was a blue ray. Still good.
4,Great Movie,"I've always wanted this movie.The packaging it came in, however, was more of a cardboard foldable flimsy sleeve.. so upon opening the package I saw the edges had been bent and out of shape which was probably damaged during delivery.The movie was in mint perfect condition though. So I was still all smiles.The message I got from this movie:- Let's take care of our planet.- Old can be just as good as new.- Love comes in different shapes and forms."
3,"GREAT movie, LOUSY packaging","I loved the film. Loved it.Those consideriing buying the 3 disc special edition should be wary. I havent had the trouble some others have had with the discs themselves. the packaging SUCKS. BIG TIME SUCKS.Its very difficult to remove the inner sub-sleeves (I wont call them cases) from the outer package (again I wont call it a case) the first time without accidentally ripping the sleeve apart. The die-cuts on the sleeves want to grab one another and the outer package. Children will almost undoubtedly end up tearing the sleeves and probably the outer package apart just trying to get the sleeves out of the package to watch the disc.After buying so many dvds & dvd sets in nice molded plastic cases, to get a cheap cardboard case, and a poorly designed one at that, is very disappointing (especially when compared to the other Pixar dvds in my collection. Wall-E deserved much better, and Disney owes its customers replacements."
5,Awesome Movie,Not only entertaining but also educational. I show this during activity periods at my school. I get to use it to discuss environmental and social issues future generations will face.
5,"Addictive, actually...","First off, for starters, the music is phenomenal. The editing is beautiful and the story is downright adorable. You'll find lots of love for this movie and the characters in it and soon cherish this film as it has become a timeless classic for Walt Disney films. Your children will simply adore Wall-E. He's the cutest! I highly recommend looking into this film if you have children (or even for yourself!). I purchased this set because I simply love this movie. It's one of my top tens."
5,Just get this!,A hallmark video of animation that appeals to kids and adults alike. And best yet is that it has plenty of replay value!
4,Wall*E,"This movie is absolutely amazing! I went to see this movie in theaters with a few friends and my girlfriend. I wasn't too fond of seeing this movie, and was already bashing it as we were walking into the theater. This movie shut me up! Pixar had my undivided attention throughout the whole movie.As for the DVD, however... I bought it off of Amazon; and didn't expect to receive a cardboard sleeve type of box. The Dvd doesn't click into place in the box; instead, it just rests in place. This really worries me because I feel like it moves around in the case and gets scratched easier. I would definitely prefer a traditional plastic case for this movie.Movie: 5 StarsDVD: 4 Stars"
4,cute,very cute and infantile cartoon with a profound meaning and global message. Great animation and original plot make it even more enjoyable
1,I'd rather live in a post apocalyptic world than watch Wall-E again,"If you believe this is a kid's movie, then it clearly was made by people who don't have kids, and marketed by people who don't have kids. If you believe it's an adult sci fi movie (as I do) well, it's truly hard to imagine something harder to sit through. I couldn't help but howl, ""Make it stop,"" and I wept tears of joy when it mercifully ended. Less fun than a sack full of kittens and a brick."
1,BOOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNGGGG!,"This is the most boring movie Pixar has ever made. (And one of the most boring EVER made!) It was almost painful to get through. My son who is 3 LOVES the other Pixar movies, so I thought this would be right up his alley. Three-quarters of the way through he was asleep. My husband and I watched the rest just to see what would happen, but my son refuses to watch it again. Just hates it. It's a great adult commentary on the world today, but does not translate well into a children's movie AT ALL."
1,Propaganda,"This movie was propaganda. Fat, mostly-white Americans have taken over control of the human race, and do nothing with it. I hated this movie. I made the mistake of buying this movie without seeing it first. The movie portrayed Americans in the worst light I have ever seen them portrayed in 'film'. If you like or have any faith in the human race, do not get this movie. We are not all fat and lazy Disney."
2,Had me bored to tears. Were my expectations too high?,"I had several trusted fiends say things to me such as ""This is the best Pixar film since Toy Story"" or ""One of my favorite animated films of all time"". With such high praise going in, it is probably not surprising that I came away disappointed.That being said, I should state that the visual quality and effects rendering were mind-blowing quality. Completely awe inspiring and stunning in every way you might imagine.But the flow and pace of the story was totally insufficient for me to sustain my enthusiasm. Perhaps it was the overtly political Malthusian anti-human stereotypes, or just the fact that there was no real dialogue for the first half of the file...hard to say. Once aspect of previous Pixar movies that I have enjoyed is the witty banter and repartee of the characters. There was none of that in this film. Yes, the robots were very physically expressive, but that was not enough to make up for the missing ingredients."
2,Overrated and a disappointment,"Considering I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar movies (Nemo being my all time favorite, with Bugs Life coming in a strong second) I was extremely disappointed with this film. However, I did find Walle to be cute and I liked the interraction with him and Eve. But then, it struck me as too preachy. Humans are now so lazy they have lost the ability to walk, drink food from cups, and have no interraction with eachother, living on a ship in space because they have ruined Earth with too much trash. Save me the lefty liberal BS and ENTERTAIN ME, please!!!!"
1,Do Not Buy This Version,"I'm rating the Blu-ray 2-disc edition only, not the film. I preordered the Blu-Ray versioin of Wall-E months before its release--at the time there was no description. As the release date neared, Disney started running ads touting the Blu-Ray with the digital download. I thought it would be great to have a choice of watching it on my HDTV or iPhone. When my package arrived (a day early), I quickly opened it and looked for instructions on getting the download. When I couldn't find any info, I checked Amazon and discovered that now there are two versions of the Blu-ray. This two disc package and a three disc one. Only the three disc version comes with the digital download. Worse, both are priced the same. Amazon, you ripped me off.Since I opened the disc already, I'm sure I can't return it. Maybe I can save you the same mistake. Be careful which you buy."
1,A Big let down,"This was a big let down for us. My 5 year old son just didn't care for it and found it boring, he has not asked to watch it again. I think he got a couple laughs near the start and that was about itI honestly came to the same conclusion as we sat through this movie, it was a slow moving movie and just wasn't very entertaining and the underlying story wasn't anything new."
4,Enjoyable,I liked it - it was well made - a little hectic at times but overall enjoyable. I would recommend it for young people or older people who like animation. K in Cody
5,Wall-E DVD,"We purchased this DVD as a gift for one of our granddaughters for Easter. We have the DVD and have enjoyed watching it. Our granddaughters, ages 3 & 5 watched it with us while visiting and really liked it."
4,much fun movie for any age,"We got this movie for a good price, delivered promptly and it is great fun."
3,Good edition... except for the digital copy.,"Overall, we are very pleased with the features of this 3-disc edition: lots of little extras which complement the movie nicely. However, I've had problems trying to download the digital copy onto our laptop; in fact, after several attempts, it still doesn't show up on my iTunes. It would have been nice for our 2-year-old son to be able to watch it 'on the go', since it's his favorite movie, but I just don't have time to spend hours on the Web doing research to try find a solution to something that should happen automatically... That's the reason behind the 3-star rating."
5,Masterpiece,"just writing a review because i think the average rating of 4/5 is very low for this movie, it is a 4.5/5 at least!best pixar movie so far and without a doubt a masterpiece."
5,Cutest movie ever!,Disney/Pixar have done it once again with the story of Wall-E. The movie is great entertaining for the whole family. You'll want to watch it again and again. The Blu-Ray version provides outstanding quality for your home viewing experience.
3,Kids love but a little stale,"Though my kids seem to really enjoy this movie I find it a little stale and boring after a while. So if want it for a movie you can enjoy WITH your children for years to come, I'd look elsewhere. But if you want something you can throw on for them, they'll surely be content enough with this one."
5,IM A KID,I A 38 YEAR OLD KID WHO FEEL IN LOVE WITH THIS CUTE MOVIE OF LOVE THAT SPANDS TIME AND SPACE. IT IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY
3,WALL-E,"The movie is great, but the DVD case is a flimsy paper case instead of an actual jewel case. Disappointed in the packaging."
5,Fantastic Film; Probably Pixar's Best To Date.,"There's not much more that can be said about WALL-E that hasn't been already, but consider this another nudge to see the film, if by some chance you haven't yet. WALL-E accomplishes incredible feats of emotion, depth, grace, and entertainment with only animation and limited dialogue. One of the finest examples of filmmakers and animators that really know exactly what they're doing. Must see!"
2,Bad DVDs / Not compatible with all DVD players,"The movie is good, but the DVD has problems. VLC on a PC can't play it on my Vista based PC. My Samsung HD931 can play the bonus features but not the movie. The same for my XP-based PC (WMP - I'm not sure what DVD decoder). It does work with the Mac OS X 10.5 DVD player application."
5,Cannot Understand,"I cannot understand how Pixar's crown jewel and masterpiece is the lowest ranking of all their nine films so far on Amazon as of right now (05/20/2009).The Toy Story movies are my personal favorites, but from a technical aspect, Wall-E is Pixar's greatest film to date and it is really one of the best films of the last decade. So why then does Pixar's Cars have 4 1/2 stars, yet Wall-E only has 4? Granted, 4 stars is a great ranking, but its not at fitting for Wall-E. This movie should have an average of 5 stars, but Wall-E should definately have at least a 4 1/2 star ranking on here.I don't know. I guess I would ask that if you feel the same way, could you go to the trouble of ranking this movie with 5 stars if you haven't already so we can get this averaged out? Please."
3,Gross,"I like the robotic characters, but the grossly fat human characters kinda ruined it for me. Really, would you want to watch morbidly obese characters throughout 1/2 of the movie... whether animation or real people? I'll pass..."
3,Okay Movie,"I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. I have heard that it was supposed to be very good, so I was expecting a masterpiece. The graphics were cool, but the story was boring. Even though Wall-E was the main character, in the climax Eve saved the day. Eve is another robot that is supposed to be a supporting character. Wall-E was a character that always needed saving from Eve. I give it a 8 out of 10 for the graphics, and 6 out of ten for the story. It was not that much about the environment, and I only laughed a few times."
1,Truly depressing film,"I purchased this film expecting to love it. Instead, I found it a terribly depressing tale about man's habitual pattern of self-abuse, environmental destruction and abandonment. There is no clever dialog to engage the viewer, indeed, there is very little dialog at all. Wall-E is an adorable little robot who has been left behind to clean up the catastrophic mess that has covered Earth, while all the remaining humans travel about space in a perpetual holding pattern, eating themselves into deformity. I cannot fathom what the other 700 some odd viewers who loved this movie found to love about it."
1,memo to Disney Studios,"Region A Blu-ray discs are intended for America the continent (Canada, USA, Central America, South America & the caribbean islands) and we are french, english, spanish and portuguese speaking citizens, please consider carefully to include at least these subtitles for all future family releases !!!!, you can be sure your sales will rise and money is all you are after, after all !"
5,Wall-E is quite the romantic.,"Wall-E is a cute film about a robot who takes trash and compacts itlike the auto trash dump does. Then a new robot comes to earth to findsomething, and Wall-E falls in love with it.When the other robot starts to jet back to its home planet, Wall-E followsbehind. Things start to happen on the spaceship and Eve the other robottries to help him get back to earth.In the process, Eve starts to care for Wall-E.It is kind of silly for robots to fall in love, it kind of shows kids whatit is like for adults when they start to have feelings for another person.In not as graphic a way as an R rated movie would show.I think it is a cute way to show kids about feelings."
2,cute but not a block buster,"missed it in the theatres and always wanted to see it. It never really dropped in price so what i eventually paid,,,was not worth it. it was just -ok-. if you see it in the mark down bin,,, its worth a try then,"
5,Great customer service...,"I was really impressed with the service I recieved and being in customer service myself, I seldom recieve quality. The seller was out of this world and made sure to keep in contact with me to make sure my order arrived prompltly. Thank You"
1,No Audio Output In English,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."
2,"Beautiful animation, boring story","The kids left the room before the 30 minute mark. Christmas madness put my wife to sleep around the same time. I was watching the clock well before the end. Certainly not a best movie contender. Cute, but no cigar."
5,One of the best films ever made,"Wall-E is easily one of the best movies of 2008. 1080P Blu Ray pix looks amazing in almost 3D over 120HZ TVs. Audio over 7.1 Systems is beautiful. Pixar has done an amazing job with the Blu ray technology.Regarding the load times of DISC 1, set your BluRay Players settings to off for BR LIVE content. If the setting is set to on, during the first viewing BR Live will attempt to update the Wall E content to the disc on your hard drive and this could take 15-90 Minutes depending on your internet connection. Add Wall E to your collection."
2,Boring,"My 3.5 year old son anticipated recieving Wall-e from Santa for at least 2 months. As soon as he opened it up on Christmas morning he was ready to watch it. Well I'm sad to say that it did'nt keep his attention very long. A couple days later I asked him if he liked Wall-e and he said, ""Yeah, well it's kind of boring."" That was my husband and my thoughts also on the movie."
1,Disappointing Quality Control,"We have seen and loved the movie, but the DVD you shipped was defective. It pixalated and stopped and skipped scenes. We know this can happen, so we arranged to return it and have it replaced. The second one had the exact same problems in the exact same places. I am assuming you got a whole shipment of defective DVD's which by the time of our return you should have known and not shipped any more from that shipment. Now we had to go through the hassle of returning it a second time and not trusting that you would not send us a third defective DVD, we requested a refund and bought it from a local discount store. I am unlikely to buy DVD's, CD's or other similar none book materials from you again.Mark Carlin"
4,Fun for all ages,My grandsons have seen this at least 100 times! I enjoy it too :-) It never seems to get old.
3,great,"My family really liked this movie and it is one we don't mind watching over a few times with the young kids, either in our TV room or in our van."
5,Great Movie!,"Wall-E was a perfect movie. The movie, while without much dialogue at first, still manages to get you hooked on the main character right away. I was amazed at how invested I was in the characters even without hearing them talk. The movie blended together humor and drama, but kept the movie light overall. I would say both kids and adults can certainly enjoy this movie. The animation looked great and Amazon's video on demand service was great too. The picture quality was amazing and I had no problems streaming the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet, and even to those who have seen it before."
3,Three disk Special Edition?,"Wow, great movie, with the WORST packaging from Disney I've ever seen... Cardboard slip cases, these are for cheap tv series sets on their last legs of marketability. Whoever thought up this packaging for the three disk special edition should be ashamed. I fork over good money for an already high priced Disney product and I expect quality, not cheap cardboard.LOVED the movie... great for the child in all of us."
2,Great Movie (obviously) - DEFECTIVE DISCS!,"After two defective 3-disc Editions (same as everyone else, movie freezes and pixelates in the first 20 minutes) I'm giving up and requesting my money back. This is the kind of nonsense that makes us all wish that Pixar hadn't given in to the Disney buyout.DISNEY...get your freakin' manufacturing sorted out."
3,2001 Revisted.,"Wall-E is a cute flick but I think kids would have a difficult time following the storyline but maybe this film is for an older crowd. Wall-E is charming but I kind of lost interest halfway through, maybe I am not intelluctual enough or something. This animated film is a mixed bag for me."
4,Great Disney film,"I really enjoyed this movie. Like most Disney films, it's good for the child in all of us, not just for children. I really like the overall message of the film about teamwork and protecting the environment. Romance isn't too sappy. Creative storyline. I love all the robots and the outer space scenes. I highly recommend it for your Disney collection."
4,Almost great...,"I would give the story a solid B. The overall enjoyment of this movie was okay, but the attention to detail in design was excellent (A+).I enjoy watching the nuances of this movie like the moving lights inside of Eve's body and how the lenses in Wall-E eyes focused."
3,"Great Film, HORRIBLE Packaging From Cheapo Disney!","I loved the film, but after buying the 3-DVD set at FYE for $29.99, I opened it to find that they went with the STUPID, STUPID, STUPID cardboard sleeve keepcase. What is with these ""clever"" suits who think they have discovered ""sliced bread"" and releasing these worthless cases which ONLY lead to SCRATCHED DVDs and annoyed customers! Wake up Disney, ya CHEAP B*ST*RDS!"
3,Unhappy with packaging/shipping,"I purchased Wall-e as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and was disappointed when I noticed that the package they shipped the movie in contained the name of the movie on the outside of the package. Since my boyfriend checked the mail, he inadvertently found out what his birthday present was before his birthday. It's not just that my boyfriend new what his gift was before his birthday, but I don't think it's a great idea to announce what's in a package for security purposes. What if someone stole it because they knew what was inside?"
5,Great movie!,I love this movie. Great movie for all ages. Not too much dialogue and no annoying singalongs!
4,Wall-E Review,"Although not quite as good as other Pixar moview, I still enjoyed this movie because of the graphics and special effects. I believe the premise of the movie was faulty and depressing, because it indicated that earth would soon be taken over by trash, so it might not be a movie for everybody. I could look beyond that and enjoy the characters."
3,Slightly Dissatisfied,The DVD is functional and damage free. The DVD case is made of cardboard and is different than those purchased at retail locations. Very disappointed with the commercial packaging - makes it difficult for storage with other DVD boxes.
5,"How true, How true","Wall-E. The people who wrote Wall-E really knew what they were doing. They told it like it is. A vision of things things yet to come (just like in Charles Dicken's ""Scrooge"" - A Christmas Carol). Maybe, if we all wake up and learn the lessons portrayed in this production, we humans and our planet may have a chance. I highly recommend Wall-E. Wall-E is entertaining and wise."
4,The Marvelous 1/2 Hour,"If they had ended the film with Wall-E desperately clinging to the probe ship leaving Earth for space unknown we would have had a 100% cinematic marvel. Brilliant film-making in any class. Instead we get an extra hour of relentless devolving into the usual pixar-madness. Fellas, remember the Wonder Boys motto--you must make the choices. A choice number one is--know when to quit!"
3,"the movie is great, the disk was faulty","I love walle, so I don't mind if my kids love it too. It has become the movie of the month--we watch it every day because my 3 and 4 yr old ask for it every day. Last month is was shrek 2 and before that Nemo. Walle is a great movie, but again, the disk is defective-- I have to start it five or ten times before it actually runs through. I'll be asking for a replacement."
2,"Great movie and features, terrible packaging!!!","Loved the film! As usual, Pixar does quality work!However, like others, I had problems with the disk. The film stalls and skips in my player (which plays other disks just fine). Disney has done the film (and its fans) a major disservice by slipping the DVDs in a scratch-prone paper-board case. Would it have really been such a huge setback for them to package the disks in a better, more sturdy case? Shame on you for being such tightwads with the packaging!"
2,No spanish :(,"I am really sad this movie does not feature spanish audio and even subtitles.i have several blu and this is the only one that does not have spanish option.Disney, remember, region 1 is ""America"" the whole continent not just the country"
4,Robot romance at the end of the world?,"All the people have gone from the Earth leaving one trash compacting robotin the big city. A robot probe is sent by the survivors on a cruiseship of outer space manned by robots and peopled by fat couch potatoes.Wall-E is a sad lonely robot ( seemly the last ecological robot on Earth).He falls for a probe robot ""EVA"".The end is a re-inhabitation of Earth by the ship people.The theme seems to be that if we took better care of ourselves and the Earth instead of looking for the easy way out,the future might turn out better?I liked the movie better than other Pixar animations."
2,Basically boring,"I got this movie based on the tremendously positive reviews it got. From the previews the movie theaters showed, it looked like the most ridiculously stupid movie one could ever see. Because of the reviews, I figured I was wrong, so I forced my family to see it. Surely it MUST be good, if so many other people loved it. Someone even said it topped Toy Story. Sorry, but i didn't even come close to being as good, let alone topping it. My whole family thought it was boring and would never want to see it again. My kids range in age from 12 to 22. My husband fell asleep, so it's not great for adults, contrary to reviews. We kept waiting for the movie to get better, but it never did. There were a few scenes that were kind of cute and led you to believe it might get better, but it was one big let down. Not worth seeing."
1,Unable to watch,"My copy was totally unviewable. I almost immediately received a replacement, which was exactly the same. I purchased 3 DVDs and 1 CD, only 1 DVD was not defective, and the replacements for all were also defective. I emailed Amazon about the replacements, and have heard nothing back."
4,Cute love story between two robots form didffernt times.,For me as an adult the movie started out a bit slow. Once Wall-e met Eva then it got more interesting. Wall-e is a robot left on earth to clean up all our trash since humans ruined the earth. They went into space where robots and computers did everything for them. They all got super fat.Eva comes from space to see if life as in a plant has returned yet. There she meets Wall-e and he goes back into space with her. It is sweet how they talk to one another and take care of each other.On a more serious note it does speak volumes about how we as humans do produce too much trash. And if we are not active and let machines do everything for us we continue to get fatter and fatter. It is a funny movie but it does have this moral.
2,Wall-e DVD CREEPY MOVIE!!!,Hi I'm an 21 year old autistic adult who sat down and watched this movie Wall-e thinking it would be like any other children's movie not creepy well I was wrong way wrong! Let me tell you I have never been more creeped out from watching a cartoon movie ever before but this movie is just plain out creepy. I mean totally on the bizarre side the only thing that was cute was the little robot Wall-e besides from that. I would'nt recommend this movie to anyone.Whatever you do save your money this movie is not worth it. Do what I do rent movie's from the library then if you like the movie then buy it but other wise don't waste your money on this one.
3,Cute. Funny. In Your Face Enviromental Issues.,Yes. The movie was cute. Yes. The movie was visually stunning. Yes. The movie was well done. But the one flaw was that it is an in your face enviromental propoganda. I am not opposed to the idea of letting people know that we need to take care of the enviroment and that we need to be aware of the amount of pollution that is building up. But dont yeah think it is a bit much to push this on our small ones? Seriously?! Really?! Do we need to really make it so in your face? Go watch the movie and see what I mean. The movie is great! I loved it. It was cute. Its just the whole enviroment twist sort of ruins it. Especially once you realize it.
1,Audio dropout in very first second of movie...,"Depending on how your system is set up, the audio is cut off in the very first second of the Blu-Ray version of the movie....How do you screw up the first second of a movie and release it?...And somehow know how to put your pants on in the morning? It's so irritating it's not even funny....."
2,"Pixar, yes. Entertaining, no.","Nowhere near as good as 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Incredibles'. There's the usual dazzling PIXAR animation, but little else. Utterly forgettable."
1,Good movie bad packaging,"I Love this movie to death, but every copy i bought(i have bought seven of them. NO JOKE!)simply would not play! i beleve that the paper mix they are useing is some how hurting the disc. I am going to rent it from netflix to see if there is a diferance."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing. I found it boring and had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. The basic plot may have some content and a hint of morality with its warnings about trashing planet earth, but it comes through as a slow moving sequence of images with no meaningful dialogue. Having said that my 3-year old still likes it.The cardboard DVD case is also flimsy and would not last long in a household with children."
1,"Great movie, horrible manufacturing","Be very careful about purchasing the special 3-disc Blu-Ray set. They had something go horribly wrong during the manufacturing. Discs missing, unplayable, etc. My first copy from Amazon had no feature film, two copies of the Bonus Disc 1, no Bonus Disc 2, and the Digital copy. The second one from Amazon had no Bonus Disc 2. Hopefully the third time is the charm."
1,Dumb,This is the dumbest kids movie I have ever had to watch. My son likes to watch it once every 8 months or so but he can barely get through the entire thing. It's almost like a silent kids film. weird.
2,trash-covered world,"In Wall-e, the Earth is covered in trash. It's inhabitable to be covered in trash. People lived in outer space on a ship called the Axiom for 700 years. One day, Eve is sent on a mission. Wall-e and Eve fall in love. Wall-e was hired to clean up the trash. Wall-e lived in a truck. On Eve's return trip, Wall-e sneaks onto the spaceship. The passengers of the Axiom meet Wall-e."
2,Propaganda,The picture quality on this flick was amazing and my kids enjoyed the movie. It will be the last time they see it though. I pitched the movie in the trash though after we watched it. (My wife bought it without me knowing.) Pixar has decided to inject the producers liberal politics into it's movies and I won't be paying another dime to watch any of them.
2,Not for adults,"I read the raving reviews and expected a walt disney classic for adults - something like The Sound of Music for the 21st century or Star Wars or something, but with an environmental theme.I drifted off when they reached the spaceship and awoke when the robots led a revolt.Definitely not for adults. I should have spent my money on Angelina Jolie instead ..."
1,A sad product from Walt Disney/Pixar. Pathetic!,"Here is a minimalist approach to children's movies. Forget the story line. Forget what was learned in Finding Nemo. The cricket ends up as a pathetic device. Create a film without dialogue or characterization, except for the scene where the robot runs about calling Eve's name. Have an environmental message that would completely baffle little children before putting them to sleep, Embrace the abstract while making some obtuse reference to fat people drifting along on floating rafts who cannot do for themselves. What this has to do with Wall-E is a lost cause. Oh, yes, create a captain character who has no personality, who is pathetic. Who would have believed that Walt Disney would forget their primary market--children? Gee, if Walt Disney/Pixar continue in the same direction as Wall-E, their future will end up as dismal as the brown planet in the movie! What were they thinking? Have they run out of plots and lovable characters to tell their story?"
1,this one will make you wan to shoot yourself,"I guess i'm not really the cerebral type. Went to see this with my kids and am not sure who wanted to get out of that theatre more, them or me. Hardly any talking in the film. If i had a gun with me in the theatre, i would end it all there and then.Uri Gofman"
1,Worst Pixar Movie Ever,"It's almost useless to rally against this movie, but its rather gross in its portrayal of obese people. It also incorrectly links obese people to environmental problems. As was displayed by many newspapers, it is not fat people who pollute, but thin and wealthy people. Most overweight people are middle class, with the majority of poverty level being overweight. These people create the least amount of waste in our society. They own less cars, less property, less stuff and pollute less.Children are unable to understand such nuance and will think be given the message that fat people are to blame for what is the fault of all humanity.If Disney wanted to make a social commentary, they should have created a movie about an overweight family living below the poverty line whose overweight because the only food affordable to them is low nutrition, high fat, chemically packed food. It would have at least been a social commentary on a problem that's actually real."
5,Wall-E Rocks,"I bought this movie to show to my freshman science classes during the down time during final exams because I's heard the good reviews and knew that I didn't have to worry about crude language, sexual situations, etc. To my surprise, I really enjoyed this tale of post-environmental disaster. The kids (many of whom are very poor and didn't see Wall-e in theatres)really got into it as well, both as entertainment and as a cautionary environmental/societal parable."
3,"Good movie, but nothing spectacular","We love Disney Pixar films like most, but the whole family found this one a little boring. It almost seemed to us as if Disney Pixar just felt pressured to release their next flick and didn't care if the storyline was weak. I know many adore the film, but for us it isn't making it into the collection."
5,One of the best movie of 2008!,"This is one of, if not the best movie of 2008. A great love story that's touching and funny. The movie looks absolutely beautiful on Blu ray and sounds incredible. Not just for kids. In fact, adults will get more out of this movie in my opinion. Just great!"
5,Excellent Movie,"Great movie for all ages. Top notch CG, excellent audio, great plot. What more can you want? :)"
4,Gotta love it.,"I gave it 4 stars because it starts off slow. Kinda ho hum. Once it gets going, it's GREAT!"
5,Wall E is hardcore!!,Wall E is the most gangsta robot since Johnny 5! This movie is like all in up yo face with that robot gangsta shizz!!
3,Wall-E -_-,"We have always loved this movie, but the quality we received was TERRIBLE. It lagged for many minutes at a time throughout most of the movie."
5,Wall-e,"I thought the film had heart and was really funny all at the same time. A good movie for all ages. It had a good message in it that would apply in today's world. I would recommend this to anyone, and would watch it again."
4,My girls love Wall-E,"I have a daughter that watches this over and over again, she loves it! She can recite it almost line for line."
2,Totally overrated,"I have loved each Pixar film so far, and I bought this film without renting it or seeing it in theaters. That was a big mistake.This movie is pretty to look at, but boring as hell. I can't see how any one, particularly children could sit through this film.This film is not even the same ballpark as Finding Nemo or Toy Story or any of the other Pixar films for that matter.There is barely any speaking and the movie is not even funny. Where is the entertainment value? I still get laughs out of all of the other Pixar films but not this one.Like I said, it sure was pretty to look at, but overall the worst pixar movie yet."
1,Last Years Pixar Flop!!!!!,"This was a complete disappointment! Having bought previous Disney/Pixar movies in the past, I bought this last Xmas without knowing what a complete waste of money it was going to be!!! I completely enjoyed titles like Nemo, Incredibles, Bugs Life, etc. and hoped that this would be as enjoyable. I WAS WRONG!!!! If you like watching a Robot trash compacter run around the planet picking up trash, and you think that the rave rievews from the so called experts must be right, then this is the movie for you!! No talking, very little plot, this couldn't even keep my four year old niece's attention for longer than a minute!!!! Save your money!!!! If not you could always resell the item if you have an account on Amazon or other competitors website!!!!"
2,The worst dialogue and plot of any Pixar movie,"Wall-E unfortunately had the worst writing of any cartoon movie. There was very little dialogue except the two main robots repeating each others names over and over again. Also, the morbidly obese humans and environmental message were heavy handed and annoying. Skip this movie and watch Up or Nemo or Ratatouille."
1,dvd skips,"I love the movie, but this dvd skips straight out of the box. There's not a scratch on it and it skips on both of my dvd players."
4,"Wall-E great movie, Bluray meh","This is a great movie, cheesy but beautiful, and my son watches it over and over. But why did we buy the bluray version? It's agonizingly slow to load and we haven't been interested in any of the features."
2,Not a kid movie,I bought this movie for my seven year old nephew after reading how great it was. He didn't like it and didn't finish watching it. It is an adult cartoon. Why is it so hard to make a good kid movie without dragging adult themes into the picture?
2,NAP TIME,"The animation is good, but my family and I were put to sleep no less than half way through the movie."
3,Not really a great movie,"WALL-E to me, is not really a great movie. The concept itself doesn't strike though the animations are good. On a blu-ray, it may look better."
2,What a flop!,"I was surprised how bad this was, especially since it is a Pixar film. The story is slow and the themes are too sophisticated for most children (and, arguably, not entirely appropiate). I was watching it with three other adults; they all left half way through. For some reason, I suffered through to the end.They really dropped the ball on this one. Save your money.Not recommended."
4,Wall*E was a surprise!,"Wall*E was not what I expected, but I was pleasantly surprised by the lessons to be learned. It is an excellent way to present the importance of the world around us to not only children but to adults as well. Great film."
4,Wall-E,It's a cute story ... I sorta got lost in the middle of it as it didn't make sense to me but in the end it all came together.
5,Great Movie and Special Features,"I loved the movie when I first saw it. I also loved all of the special features on the making of the movie, as well as the Pixar documentary. Overall, a great buy."
5,"A truly great ""film"" experience","Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and other great early silent film stars must be applauding at the first thirty minutes or so of this amazing little film.This film not only belongs on the same mountain as Sleeping Beauty and other Disney classics, but alongside the truly great masterpieces of motion picture art.I honestly don't know what higher praise I could give."
5,Wall Eyed,"Saw the new Disney aquired pixar studios movie called ""Wall E"" Great computer generated movie with a message. The background tells of earth consuming to excess fueled by the corporations BnL, Buy n Large. Humanity has grown fat and lathargic and left the earth to be cleaned up by robots. Wall E is one of those robots, the last functioning one. He cleans up the trash by crushing into a block one at a time and has left towers of the stuff among the deserted city, great visuals. Very cute, funny, cool, just so much work goes into these by aritists and the script is well done. I took the critics on yahoo and viewers at their word for giving it an A rating and was not dissapointed."
5,One of Pixar's Best,"WALL.E is probably my favorite movie of the year so far. It's original, imaginitive and actually one of the best science fictions movies despite being an animated film. It's also fun while being sweet, charming and romantic.It's smart as well with how mankind is off getting fat on a ship after they ruined Earth. They are so used to technology doing everything for them that they don't even walk. Hey, it could happen eventually with how things are going lol. Oops I hinted at Global Warming, I forgot that ignorant people say it's a myth so they can continue driving fancy cars and big trucks lol. Anyway Wall-E is one of Pixar's best next to Toy Story 1-2 ,Finding Nemo and that rat movie that I can't spell lol."
5,Great.,"This is a quirky movie, set about seven hundred years in the future. Humans have become fat pigs who have robots do everything for them. This movie is actually quite insightful, and it almost gives a warning to everyone who watches it to not waste your life. Of course the little robot Wall-e has to come and save the day. There are a few punchlines and physical comedy as with the previous Pixar movies, but not as many. There is not a lot of ""dialogue"", so to speak, at the beginning, because Wall-e is the only halfway ""living"" thing left on earth. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will just say if you like Monsters, Inc. you will probably like this."
5,Cute!,"Very cute movie! We arn't the type who runs out and buys every dvd or blu ray. Since ""really"" how much are we going to watch it?? Anyway, this seems like a great one to add to your collection. My husband likes it so much, that he actually ALSO asked for a blu ray version for Christmas...lol. We'll have two copies. Cute movie and very nicely made!"
4,Wall-E,This was an excellent movie that was enjoyable for the whole family to watch. My children's ages range from 2-7 years and they all were able to sit through the entire movie. This is a difficult feat in my house. The kids were able to enjoy the characters of the movie and their actions. The adults were able to obtain the message the movie was trying to get across which was too complex for the young children to understand. Warning: Your kids might talk non-stop about the part where Wall-e puts the bra on his head!
4,"superb animation, but not as impressive storyline","The latest animated film from Pixar is cute and cuddly, but unfortunately the story is touching but not revolutionary. The most fascinating thing about Wall-E is that hardly anyone utters a word for the first hour or so of the movie. And yet, it's better that way - pictures speak louder than words, and Pixar's fantastic animation yells out to us in a way that no one else can. Yet, as a follow up to Ratatouille, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the limited scope of the story of Wall-E. It's a shame that Pixar chose to play it safe and focus on the touchy-feely aspect of the story instead of truly exploring armageddon and teaching kids (and adults too!) about recycling, sustainability, and taking care of the Earth."
3,Not what was described on website and in flyer,"I wrote to the company saying I would keep the movie even though it was not the wide screen version advertised in the description on the website and in the flyer accompanying the disc. The box was crushed, but the disc was ok. There was a paper in with the disc that said it was a crushed disc and that it had been part of the info on the website. I admit that if it was, I missed it."
1,"Defective DVD, great movie","I absolutely loved the movie and pre-ordered the set. Sent the first back because the DVD and the digital copy was defective. When I receive the replacement dvd, it had machine made scratches on it AND it did not work, and neither did the digital copy. Amazon will not process a second replacement so be warned. Amazon has a bad batch. GET YOUR DVD from someone else."
2,"Great movie, great hi-def, wretched Bluray ""features""","The movie itself is wonderful. The visual and audio quality is beautiful.The BluRay ""features"" of this apparently mean that it is a BR-Java disc, which means that you can't resume play of the movie at any point like you can with a normal BluRay. Which makes this an extremely frustrating movie to watch if you ever have to stop it.This is particularly because I was initially having trouble getting surround sound until I put my PS3 in ""Bitstream"" audio mode instead of ""Linear PCM"" which is the default. I must have watched the opening Disney cruft at least 20x trying to get the audio sorted.Another very annoying privacy violation by this BR disc: When I allowed it to download updates from the internet (something I normally do not do), it somehow PERMANENTLY set the ""Allow disc to connect to the internet"" to Always Allow instead of Always Ask.To be honest, if I had it to do over again I probably would have just gotten the DVD version."
2,Problematic Tracking,"Although I loved the movie, I returned my original purchase once, and even the second DVD replacement still didn't play correctly. My DVD player can play my recent Hellboy release, but not Wall-E. No fine-tuning is available for the tracking, and that's what I believe the problem is, or I could try to fix it myself. As it is, I am having difficulty returning the item a second time. I loved the movie - and would recommend it to anyond - but watching it hesitate and pixelate for the duration of the movie was a big bummer.Sign Me,Disappointed Customer (Tracking Related Problem)"
5,Pixar At Its Best!,"I think that most of the reviews have already covered what Wall-E is. A marvelous picture. Not a simple cartoon but a sensitive movie with countless messages to everyone who sees it.But I am here because of the 3 Disc Blu-Ray Edition. I would like to know ""where is the documentary THE PIXAR STORY""? I was told it is on Disc 1, but I don't seem to find it there. I've searched all 3 discs and nothing.Can anyone tell me please? 'Cause I love this documentary and I would like to see it.I would like to thank PIXAR for the incredible movies the make year after year.To Infinity & Beyond!!!!"
2,After all the hype...,"I think that perhaps after all the hype about this movie, I felt a little bit let down. I didn't think that it was so great."
2,"Hold on folks, this isn't even close to a masterpiece","I love Pixar, but everyone preaching that Wall-E is some sort of modern masterpiece is making me sick.Now the movie wasn't horrible, but come-on folks - it's nothing to tell your friends about and I certainly wouldn't watch it again.I would actually say it's one of Pixar's poorest movies yet. Poor story, poor animation, poor music. Well ok, it was a horrible story. Haven't we seen/read/watched this same story a dozen times before? Add robots and it's new, right?Reviewman says: Bargain DVD rack if you really need to buy it, got mine used for six bucks and feel I overpaid."
1,English Closed Captions for the Hearing Impaired,"Mr. Iger of Walt Disney World Companies.There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up. Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up? The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH. As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up. I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.Without ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the movie menu set up, we will not be able to purchase particular movies of interest. You lost a sale on this one and I am sure as well as others in the future."
1,Doesn't work : (,"The box the movie came in was in terrible shape, but the movie looked fine. Looks can be deceiving. We put it in and got through just enough of the movie for everyone to be interested when it got stuck and we couldn't get it to fast forward, skip, or anything. Disappointing."
2,Arrived damaged.,"This arrived but the dvd box is crushed and damaged. As there are only 2 days until xmas, I am going to keep this so I can gift it to my mother like I panned (here mom! it's a crushed dvd! I love you!). I sure hope the disc inside isn't broken. It's too late for me to go the request a replacement route, or I would just do that. I'm happy to send you pictures if you want."
5,Family friendly movie,This movie was great for a night in with the family and was surprisingly enjoyable for the adults as well. Pixar always does a great job. Two thumbs up!
5,Great movie!....but Digital copy doesn't work on Android,"Great movie, but I didn't realize the Digital Copy won't work on my Android tablet.....I'll have to figure out how to convert it to an Android-friendly format."
2,Cover could have been better,We used this as a Christmas Gift and had it shipped directly to our friends. We were told that cover of the movie was really messed up. Disc was good. Considering it was a gift we would like to been presented better.
5,Movie,It was brand new as stated and received very quickly. This is a cute movie for the whole family and a great cast.
5,What's not to like?,"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said - excellent movie! Strong message for adults who see - what is tongue-in-cheek set in the far future - happening now! They can speculate on that while enjoying an innocent love story, and of course enjoying the many amusing moments. Kids will enjoy the latter, and many will get the other message about Western society (children are always smarter than we give them credit for). Who wouldn't like this movie?"
5,Information For Non US / Canada Buyers,"I live in the UK and purchased the WALL:E 3 Disc Edition with Digital Copy as I have a Multi Region DVD player.Unfortunately, because I am in the UK, I cannot take advantage of the Digital Copy as my iTunes is not the US version.I just wanted to advise other potential customers of this."
5,Perfection,"There was never a more impressionable movie. It's a wonderful, telling tale everyone in the family can adore from beginning to end! The creators should be honored to have concocted such a treasurable jewel for the ages! In a word, it's truly a masterpiece! I can't speak highly enough about this movie! :)"
5,"Eat Smart, Play Hard","Eat Smart, Play Hard is great!!! It's perfect for the weekend warrior or the serious athlete. Dr. Applegate even writes about what to eat for yoga and golf in addition to marathons, bicycling, and weight lifting. There's super recent info on supplements and detailed meal plans for whenever you workout. It's straight-forward, easy to understand, fun, and has tons of great tips. A definite must-read for whatever exercise you do!"
3,Good advice for the super jock,"This book, while probably good, is for the person getting 3-4 hours of heavy exercise per day. I found some good hints, but this is not applicable for the average person."
2,don't waste your money on this one,"I agree with others who have said this book is just too simplistic. I am not an expert but consider myself to be very knowledgeable in the area of nutrition and sports nutrition. This book did not offer anything I did not already know and in my opinion it has close to nothing to offer athletes. Liz Applegate writes a column for Runners World magazine in which she shares alot of useful information, unfortunatly she seems to have left it all out of this book. I usually do not write such poor reviews however I read runners world monthly and do not feel that the book deserves the ""hype"" it has recieved."
4,Need to know what snacks will optimize your...,"As a Fitness and Nutrition Professional, I recommned this book to my clients who are working towards weight loss or sports performance goals. The book gives great ideas for snacks prior to and post exercise which is nice. When clients need a little more personal advice I offer customized meal planning, but this book gives them basic ideas. One thing is for sure... you can't out train good nutrition. I use this book, customized meal planning and Advocare supplements to get the job done.Pros: Easy To Understand,Good snack ideas,Informative,RelevantBest Uses: Exercise performance,Sports nutrition,Weight lossChris Knight"
4,"Great, not wonderful","I guess if you're a HUGE YLT fan you'll find this album to be one of , if not their finest. As a moderate fan, however, I can definely say I liked this album, but it did'nt leave me as satisfied as ""And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out"" did. A great album nonetheless."
5,"Sprawling, diverse album","This album was the best album of 1997. The first half of the album (tracks 1-8) ranks as some of the best, flowing passages of music I've ever heard. The second half of the album is a bit more restrained with the band dipping into twangy Lambchop territory (One PM Again, The Lie and How We Told It), skronky drone ( Spec Bebop), and bossanova/60s pop standards (Center of Gravity, My Little Corner).....I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is a great summer album perfect for blasting in the car as you make that road trip to the West Coast."
5,Get in the right mood.....,The first time I listened to this disc - it felt like nails going straight into my eardrums. We were on a road trip - not the right 'vibe' for the cd. Since I've listened to it quite a few times - and in the correct mood - feels like a really good rest!!!!!
5,Autumn Sweater changed my life,Autumn Sweater is probably one of the most beautiful songs I've ever had enter my eardrum. I have never heard a song come close to it in perfection.
5,every song swings my swing,"A Yo La Tengo album represents how life should be: Off-Beat, Disheveled and Gorgeous, and with this album they have reached their apex. Fine, they deliver and dish obscurity to the masses and some will claim that makes their morsels of strange poeticness less startling, but Yo La Tengo is too talented to stay unknown for so long. Every song is sung with a different gusto. You'll hear cowboys on the low key ""One PM"" and lovers on ""Autumn Sweater"" and shimmy-shake rockers on ""Little Honda."" Eventually, you'll start thinking that Yo La Tengo wrote a soundtrack for your life. It will be that moment you're sitting in some blurry half-sun/half-moonlight blankly thinking of weary ballerinas and broken cliffsides and every note you're hearing will make utter sense."
5,Who's on first...,"Pavement gets all the credit for creating the 90s indie rock sound, and I have to say Pavement is truly great. But I think people neglect the importance of Yo La Tengo. To me, they are the Velvet Underground of the 90s. Basically comprised of one couple and a few other musicians brought in as necessary, this band blends pop harmonies and a strong sense of melody with sonic dissonance and feedback. In some songs, you'd swear you were hearing a warmer, friendlier Sonic Youth. In others, the band sounds like folk-rockers from the 1960s. There's variety here, versatility, and creativity. Something missing from a lot of pop music these days. I recommend this one and ""Fakebook,"" along with ""Painful,"" as a good overall introduction to the Yo La Tengo sound."
5,the best,"easily the best Yo La Tengo album. If you're a fan and you don't own it... what are you doing? if you haven't heard Yo La Tengo and are curious, then start with this one."
4,mostly very good but too long,"This is their best album that isn't ""Fakebook."" It's also too long. Why do people insist on putting out double albums all of the time just because it fits on the CD? The ""Little Honda"" EP is absolutely fantastic also, all covers including Sandy Denny & The Kinks"
3,The Other Side of the Coin,"This CD is mediocre. I'm sorry to say it, but I just wasn't that jazzed about the listening experience. Should have bought the newest album first. I've heard that one and was impressed, but this album is all over the board and not what I was expecting after reading these reviews. My recommendation to a potential buyer...take the time to listen to the tracks and scrutinize these reviews. I'm starting to think that band members are sending their fan clubs and girlfriends out to these sites to write nice things about them. Don't get me wrong, this group has got something very special. I just think it can be found on other albums. I wouldn't recommend this one to a 1st time listener...start with something a little more consistent. Good luck and good music!"
2,"Too many questions, and not enough depth.","This is a good book for getting to know someone if you have no idea what to ask them, but common sense covers almost all the questions. I would try something else, if you want more than a few sentence answer from someone. I would not recommend it for a preparation before marriage, you can do better."
5,Parents should give this book to their kids.,"Gave this to my daughter and her fiancee to prepare them for the most important decision they'll ever make. They laughed at first, but can't stop talking about how much fun it is to ask all the questions. The sections about finances and in-laws are particularly good. I am recommending this book to all my friends who have kids of marrying age."
5,Honeymoon Enhancer,"I learned so much about my fiance by going over these questions with him. Assumptions I was taking for granted were revealed to be inaccurate in several places - I was really glad we talked about them BEFORE getting married when it was probably easier to be honest. Afterwards I think I would have been more afraid of being honest and maybe of ""ruining"" our sense of togetherness. Other areas where I thought we might hold different opinions I was happily surprised to see we really agreed! I know that having done this (fun! really!) ""homework"" our ""honeymoon"" will last a whole lot longer! Great book - highly recommended to anyone in a serous relationship."
3,Bought 2 Copies,"I bought two copies of this book, one for me and one for my fiancee at the time. We would read and answer on our own, then compare answers together. She is now my wife and I believe this book and the time we spent will cut down on the amount of misunderstandings and issues."
4,okay,like the subject says- the kindle format isn't very user friendly :) but interesting content. The questions are thorough and informative.
3,Review,This book is okay. The questions are pretty cheesy. Wish I would have looked through it first.
5,1001 questions,"This book is great - TONS of questions about every topic out there. My fiance and I loved going through these questions on long car trips. Many of the questions spark longer, more in depth conversations which is nice. It's just a good book to get you thinking or talking!"
2,wish I didn't buy it...,"It was a waste of my money. The questions were all ones I've heard about so many other times, and the format of the questions wasn't fun or even very interesting..."
4,Great idea for couples!,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. We talk about marriage all the time, and this book is a great way to find out what the other person wants in a partner/marriage and just in their life in general. We talk about things like this all the time, but there are certain questions that we just never thought to ask. We've only gotten through the first few pages but have already learned a lot about each other!"
4,"Fun, old-fashioned Brazilian dance music","A nice live album of classic, early-style acoustic ""pagode"" samba, full of cavaquinho mandolins and vocal choruses galore. Nothing new here, though that's the appeal -- just fun, bouyant, smile-producing samba. Recommended!"
3,U-neek is the word,"Okay,the Mouse has definitely headded in a different direction with his music on this album. It's o.k. but not the type of mouse I am accustomed to listening to. There are a couple of tracks I do like, Border Patrol and get away, the Mouse's cover of the Led Zeppelin tune Dyer Maker is really cool/funny too."
5,Wonderful verse for kids!,We discovered these stories when they were published as individual tales. The illustrations are great; the poetry is just right for younger kids. All three of my boys have loved this book.
3,"good product, when they work.","This product is a wonderful safety enhancement for bikes, but the quality control is pretty iffy. Of the 4 I purchased (2 pair), only 2 worked properly. One wouldn't switch on, the other wouldn't switch off.From a brightness perspective, the blue ones are much better than the red. The LED is much larger and projects light sideways, perpendicular to the bike wheel. The red ones project light toward the wheel hub.I had to purchase the red ones to fit my presta valves, but swapped the blue innards and the red base to get blue-on-presta.I'd suggest buying twice the amount you need so you can discard the ones that don't work."
3,Mediocre at best,"These only light up sometimes. If my child hits a curb or something, they flash spectacularly, but with plain riding, they don't always light up."
5,good lite,have had 2 of these lights now for a few months. really like them. i use the strongest led lights in them and they work great in my 24'X 14' kit/dining room combo
4,Not bad at all,"I was looking for a two or three light fixture for the hallway. I bought this mostly to see how would work for us. I like it; my wife doesn't.The fixture provides just enough light to the nearest furniture in the living room to read by using the recommended BR-30 bulb. The other two units have 15W coil florescent bulbs and illuminate hallway walls and pictures. It does both jobs fairly well, the problem is not with the fixture in any way. We will keep it for until we find something better.My wife does not like seeing the individual bulbs; they are bright.The included bracket made it easy to replace the simple fixture we were using.I don't know if all three hoods will point in the same direction but they will come close."
5,MULTI-CEILING LIGHTS,Wow! These light were so easy to install. It took mere minutes. I now have enough light in my hallway to see into my hall closet and not trip over any thing that might have been left out. This is so good that we are installing two of them in the new pantry we're building (one at each end) and one over the new tub we're putting in. (I like to read in the tub and standing lamps aren't all that safe.) I'm considering ordering more as they give an updated appearance and more light to whatever area (house built in 1950s) they are put in. I would recommend these lights whole-heartedly.
4,Could be worth a gambleon this one.,"I didn't really know what I was getting into on this one. I've never seen Liam Lynch's t.v. show, in fact, I had only seen the video for ""My United States of Whatever"" before picking this one up. Fortunately, I am pleasantly surprised. This is not another Weird Al, Lynch's songs are actually cool and worth listening for more than just humour's sake. Most of the album is for humour's sake such as the previously mentioned ""Whatever"" and the amusing ""Still Wasted from the Party Last Night"". If you're familiar with David Bowie's early '70s work then the ""Fake Bowie Song"" will leave you in stitches, as well as in awe at his dead-on imitation.The album also comes with a dvd, although increasingly common, this is actually one worth having. Lynch's videos are funny, and the home videos and puppet clips are worth checking out.This album is a bit of a gamble, but is certainly an entertaining collection."
2,"Uneven, but overall not that great","The standout is, of course, ""United States of Whatever"" which is pretty good, but the rest of the album falls flat. His fake Bjork, Depeche Mode, etc... songs are better than the rest, but they don't make this album worth buying."
3,You needs to buy dis!,"It was very thriling to hear Bjork's demo recording for her forthcoming album alongside a new Bowie song. Also great to know the Pixies are back and better than ever!!! As for the rest of the songs: imagine Beck meeting Ween for dinner and running into Jack Black who had just dumped David Cross for Mike Patton. You DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BUY DIS, YO!!!!!!!! Whatever"
3,Buyer Beware,"As for the content of this book, I could take it or leave it. I didn't think it was a particularly bad book, but neither was it a particularly good book. What did upset me is that my copy is literally falling apart after a semester of light use. The first six or so pages fell out completely and now an entire signature is falling out in the middle of the book. When paying 80 dollars for a book, the least I expect is it to hold together for a semester. I've own heavily read paperbacks that have lasted longer."
4,Gets better with re-reading,"I used this book for a standard college-level first course on thermodynamics. I hated it at first, because many of the concepts that the authors introduce at first seem random and useless. But when I finished the course and began reviewing for the final exam, the excellent structure of this book became more apparent. The connections between principles discussed in later chapters, like kinetic theory and Landau phase transitions, are very well-motivated by issues presented earlier in the text. The problems at the end of each chapter are appropriately straightforward, but nonetheless take material in interesting new directions.Some of the derivations are truly poor (the speed of sound under the adiabatic approximation being particularly heinous) but overall this book is leagues ahead of several other statistical mechanics books I've reviewed, which often over-emphasize the math early on and fail to present the beauty of the subject."
3,Very poorly printed...,"The book itself is a classic and generations of good physicists have studied from this book, so I'm not going to review the book itself. What I did not like one bit was the poor paper quality. The pages are so thin that print from the next page is clearly visible. The last three pages (one blank and two printed with constants, non critical) had been glued together. I'm not going to return the book because if I do, it'll waste paper as they'll throw my current copy away, but if I'm paying $122 for a book, I'd expect atleast decent publishing if not stellar publishing."
2,"Comprehensive, but a BAD book","I'm using this book for an undergraduate thermo class. It is one of the worst textbooks I have used. It may be large and comprehensive, but the organization is horrible. The book is extremely unclear, and when you start to do the problems at the end of the chapter, you really see how little got through to you. The problems are often vague and hard to understand, which adds to the problem. You can read it over and over and still get neither the math of thermodynamics, nor the physics behind it."
3,Great review but hard to learn from!,"I used this book for a junior/senior level undergrad physics course (for majors). The professor loved the book however many of the students, with only exposure to Halliday/Resnick/Krane intro physics, found it difficult to follow the abbreviated treatment of stat-mech... there seemed to be a large gap between the 2 approaches! With a good professor this can be an excellent text but beware...you may find yourself needing supplementary texts such as Reif's ""Statistical & Thermal Physics"" and even his Berkeley Series sophomore level ""statistical Physics"" for an explanation of concepts."
1,the lesser of evils,"I am taking a course that uses this book as its text, and I have to say, I am sorely unimpressed. In agreement with a previous review, I would say that the problms set out by kittel have two dominant themes; 1 they are painfully difficult to interpret as to what kittel expects you to learn from them, and 2, they are trivial to complete once you pierce the fog of the question. A message to prospective future instructors of a stat-mech course, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS TEXT, YOUR STUDENTS WILL THANK YOU!"
3,Poorly manufactured book!,"I remember when I took this couse as an undergraduate it was very challenging to develop an ""intuitive feel"" for the subject material and the book seemed to make matters worse. Several years later and after a little mathematical ""seasoning"", I have revisited Kittel's Thermal Physics and now realize how well the material is presented. However, I am forced to give the book 3 stars because I remember how EVERY textbook in the class(~15 students) fell apart before the semester ended. I remember paying nearly $80 for the book at the time- totally unacceptable for a book in this price range. I was actually hoping to find an inexpensive used copy to replace my original, but after reading the reviews, it appears that the binding problem has not been corrected yet. So, I guess I'll have to tolerate keeping the pages intact as I thumb through the book."
3,cheap Tiwan copies,This is a great book for the field but some companies get cheap foreign copies that WILL NOT LAST. I happened to buy one for the statistical mechanics class that I am in and the spine has broken and the pages are coming loose. MAKE SHURE YOU CHECK WITH THE SELLER TO SEE THAT IT IS TRUELY A US OR EUROPEAN COPY.
5,Absolutely Great,"I sincerely enjoyed Mr. Decker's book. He is as good an author as he is a reporter. Word has it he is working on a new book about Utah history, I can't wait!"
2,fell apart,I bought one of these one year ago and was very happy with it's appearance and function. But yesterday it just fell apart. Apparently the screw in the bottom that holds the whole thing together worked loose and went down the drain. That seems to me to be a design flaw. I doubt most people will want to have to remember to periodically tighten the screw.
1,Obvious Quality Flaws,"I ordered two sink drains and both have obvious flaws in workmanship. One fixture has a deep pitting through the satin finish and into the underlying brass. The other had an uneven finish coating with an unfinished area appearing to be scortched or blackened.To be fair this is a reflection of poor quality by the parts manufacturer(or their supplier). Unfortunately, this also means that the vendor shipped these parts to their customer.In the future, I will buy locally in a situation where I can inspect the product before making a purchase. My choice of fixture will be based on the availability and inspection of all required parts before purchase."
3,A good read,"Book gives good pointers on how to write about music concerts, analysis, etc. Was looking for a book to help with papers I have to write for classes but this did not really fit my needs. Still, interesting and did get my brain going."
1,Ripped off!,"I purchase 2 Pioneer subwoofer grille covers for ACE DIGITAL CLUB. The site said that there were three available at the time I ordered. I paid and received an email informing me that the covers had been discontinued and that I would only be receiving one cover. I was charged for both covers and the shipping was for two covers. I left ""fair"" feedback that I was immediately called on the phone and asked to remove and they would make it right. I agreed. I received $7.00 refund for shipping but nothing for the grill that was not sent. I tried to email again to find out what happened and now they will not contact me. I now have a grill cover with no match that I cannot use. I have been charged for something I never received. I feel that they have ripped me off."
5,A good little mp3 player,"Well, I read the reviews here and elsewhere, and noted that the newer firmware versions allow transfers to the T30 as an external ""flash"" drive, so decided I'd give it a try. So far it has played everything I've tried exceptionally well, no problems. This includes audiobook MP3s (non-DRM) and music MP3s. I've not tried WMA or OGG yet, as I've seldom used them. The software that comes with the player automatically updates the firmware, making this a hassle free task. There are now cheaper 1GB players out there, however this one works just fine and being from iRiver looks as though it will have ongoing support and firmware upgrades for sometime to come - something cheaper no-name players often lack."
1,no instructions,"I received no documentation for this product at all. It may work fine but until I have time to research on line to see if I can find some instructions for it or come across someone that knows how to use it, it is a pretty red box sitting in the bottom of my drawer. Very disapointing!"
1,Windows Media Player incompatibility,"Incredibly frustrating. I was quite happy with my T30 until I recently upgraded my windows media player to version 11. It became IMPOSSIBLE to add any new music. There is a firmware upgrade on the iriver website, which I downloaded and installed three times. It just doesn't work! I managed to solve this problem only by rolling back to WMP 10.BTW, I emailed iriver customer support about this problem and waited 17 days for a response."
1,Better Have XP AND MediaPlayer 10!!!!!!,"The fact this device will only work with XP/MediaPlayer 10 makes this player a major pain. Go over to a buddy's and think you will drag and drop his mp3's to your player, they better have the newest setup! Ditto at your work ect.. It has really been a pain. Sound quality is great, battery life is ok(AAA)and I really like the size/shape.I really wish i had read the fine print, but i thought it's iriver they will have all kinds of firmware upgrades, Nope not anymore they have sold out to Microsoft."
4,"great mp3 player, fast delivery!","The MP3 player was in mint condition, except there is a glitch where it shuts off randomly. But the same one I bought in the store did the same thing..."
4,Good recorder/encoder,PROS:The T30 makes a great voice recorder.The mic and line-in sources both produce quality results.Both WMP and explorer modes are supported (with firmware change)CONS:WMP mode is slow with WMP11Menu navigation takes some time to learn
1,does not work with Toshiba laptops,"Beware -- this unit does not work with Toshiba laptops. Tech support is non-existent. You will never get through on the phone. Email support is non-existent. You will have to wait weeks to hear back.If it does work with your laptop, this unit does a great job of recording and playing."
4,"Great, but not perfect","I got this one from Bestbuy and have enjoyed it for three days.Pros:--the sound quality (and the recording quality) is great, not less than or even better than iRiver iFP 700 series and iFP 800 series which use Philips chips;--the design is very cool, far more than the above two series;--the size is amusingly small;--the battery life is great ( I am still using the one that came with the player);--If you have installed Windows Media Player 10 in your computer, it can be used directly as a UMS, without the need to chage firmware.Cons:--Unbelievably, no FM tuner!!!--No armband or belt clip!!!"
3,no Windows 2000 support,"I returned this mp3 player (thanks to the great customer serviceof Amazon.com). Be aware that this model sold it the US and EUdoes not support Windows 2000. I happen to have a Windows 2000Professional on my home computer. If you have a Window XP, themp3 player works great. I tried the device with a notebook atwork which has a Window XP Professional installed, it justworks fine."
4,Read This!!!!,"I just found a way to get around having to use Windows Media Player. Good thing, because I was just about to give the player away. Using Windows Media Player, there is no way to organize the music in folders (playlists), so you can just go from folder to folder without thumbing through all the songs in each folder. What I did was upgrade to the latest firmware, and then I double-clicked the player in ""my computer"" and opened the data file. Then I just dragged and dropped the folders into the data file. All of the music shows and plays in the folders I arranged it in. iRiver makes good players that can be a pain."
2,Low Quality Memory Foam,The quality of the memory foam of this cushion is really bad. After a week of use the cushion is sagged - I only weigh 120 pounds.
1,Misadvertising,"It is advertised as ""Memory Foam"" but it is simply ordinary ""urethane foam"" as the label on the product revealed. I was quite disappointed since there is a very significant difference between the two. It was sent promptly but was not the product that I thought I was purchasing."
3,ok,"meh... goes flat after a few hours, but comfortable for the beginning of my sit session... not really worth the dough"
3,I will never purchase from this company again!,"Product was ordered February 15th, 2010 and did not receive the product until April 5th. People do not know how to take instructions for shipping . They cannot read or understand instructions. It took 3 mailings to finally receive the memory foam cushion.When it was sent out again it was shipped ground again and took 12 more days."
2,Rocket Red,"I was looking for a red copy paper, so I ordered this one. Big disappointment, the color is hot pink - far from red. I would've tried to return it, but I have time sensitive work, that I had planned, for this paper."
3,NOT A CUT ABOVE THE REST,"The cut and clarity is beautiful, however....The hole was cut in a very sloppy manner. The entire area is scratchy and white in color across the entire top. I'll use it, but it will have to be hugging the ceiling to hide the flaw...."
1,Broke before shipped!,"I am so disappointed in this. I ordered crystals in all of the colors of the rainbow, to bead and hang on my patio, but this one (the only one from this company) is shattered where they drilled the hole for hanging. It is still intact, but I don't dare hang it, because it will break. This is easily noticeable, and the person who put in the box to ship had to have seen the severity of the break."
4,like the size,"this is a pretty ball and i like the 40mm size, the 30mm size is quite small, i had ordered other balls taht were 30mm and they are pretty but too small for me personally"
2,"Nice to Look At. Honestly, No Rainbows","This prism is good looking but only produces little white dots on the walls. Colored prisms don't produce much in the way of color splashes although they're attractive in themselves.Clear prisms can produce a lot of rainbows. Among the clear prisms, those with large facets produce the strongest colors as well as the longest and widest color splashes all over the room.I purchased 7 prisms through Amazon. Among them were 6 different kinds as one was a duplicate from a different vendor. All these prisms were manufactured by the same company, which has its own web site marketing prisms and sells them for much higher prices. Therefore, I have experience with the different prisms available through Amazon.This prism produces the best colors, by far, and the largest color splashes:76mm Teardrop Crystal Prisms #873-76."
4,Great Overview of Why Railroads have come back from the dead,"Railroads Triumphant has given me an excellent history as to why railroads died, and why they are coming back. The author's explanation of the various forms of governmental intervention and how they led to the railroad's demise were enlightening. The Stagger's Act of 1980 clearly was the defining moment when the government stopped micro-managing the railroads and allowed them to serve the public again. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who thinks that railroading is dead! I also reccomend it to anyone who thinks that governmental control is good for the public.."
2,disappointing,"This book is really a knock-off of the author's 'Colloquial Hindi'. Of course the two languages do share a vast vocabulary and grammar in common, but what it really means here is that if you already have one of these books (the Hindi would be the better one to get) you really don't need the other. The dialogues, grammar and exercises are all in a phonetic transcription and only the dialogues (in the back of the book) are given in the nastaliq script. The printing of this beautiful and ornately detailed script is so tiny that it is literally necessary to use a magnifying lens to read it."
1,Stop now! Save your money!!,"This is truly one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read. The plot line is pathetic and the author has the writing skills of a first grade student in a completely rural environment. If this book even had an editor or proofreader they should be fired immediantly. The grammatical errors and non-sensical statements made by the 'author' will truly make your head hurt. The only thing that would impress me is if I did find out a small child had written the book. On the other hand, this book did inspire me to believe that truly ANYONE could write a book and become published. Stay far, far away from this book, or stock plenty of pain medication prior to diving in."
1,"A Poorly Written, Pointless Book","This is THE worst book I've ever TRIED to read. It's a struggle to get through each page due to the grammatical errors, typos and the poor story development. I try to keep an open mind in giving new, self published authors a chance but it's books like this that fulfill any and all negative stereotypes. Stay far away from the title!"
2,Really Underwhelmed,"I purchased one of these from a retailer a few months ago, spent about $55 thinking this was going to be a really good hub. I liked the idea of nesting them too if needed.I had difficulty getting the top ports to read consistently, the usb cord didn't fit well and kept coming undone every time I would try to attach something, and after just 2 months, the hub quit working all together. The power light would come on, but nothing would read at all. I tried several things and it still never worked. Worse than that, the store had quit carrying this model and wouldn't do a refund or exchange for me. I pretty much had a $55 plastic brick.I'm not down on Belkin by any means, I think they make good products generally. I may have just got a bad one, but overall, my experience was less than optimal."
3,Belkin 7 Port Hub,"This is a good little 2.0 USB Hub. Works very well and serves it's purposes.However, for me, they only last a few years before they have to be replaced. But worth the cost of the Hub."
3,It would be great if I had a MAC,"I had the 4 port version of this and everythign worked fine with windows XP and windows 7. However, this 7 port hub just won't play nice with windows 7. I checked online and I'm not the only one having the problem. If you are running windows 7, I would suggest buying something different."
1,"Seemed to work fine, then it died.","I really liked the design of this hub. And I still do. Too bad it is uselss now. It seemed to work fine in the beginning. After about a year, I noticed that my shared printer would occasionally stop working. I had the hub connected to an Airport Extreme, and that way I could share the printer over my wireless network. The hub was the last thing that I suspected, until I tried using an older 4-port hub in its place, and then things were working again. Sure enough, it was the Belkin hub that had died. This looked like a good deal in the beginning, but not any more."
2,Unreliable,"This hub generally worked well for the first few months with pretty much any product I attached to it. Later on, it became useful for only some of the simpler devices I was using. It works fine for iPod docks or USB printers, but forget attaching a USB portable hard drive to it. The drives will suddenly disconnect and it's about 50/50 as to whether or not they'll reconnect. This is particularly bad for someone like me who keeps their entire, 100+ GB iTunes library on an external drive. I had the same problems with external drives regardless of whether or not they were USB-powered or wall outlet-powered. If all you want to use it for is an MP3 player, printer, or digital camera, then you're probably safe. If you want a hub that you can trust to work, look somewhere else."
5,"Solid hub, works with all my devices A-OK","This is my third USB hub and is the best ! Definately worth the price !! Don't buy the no-name cheap hubs, they won't work with every USB device.My previous hub was a D-link, worked with everything but my USB 802.11n adapter, then 3 ports stopped working after I left plugged in my flash drive overnight, that triggering me to buy this one. And get this, after plugging in my old 1/2 working D-link into the Belkin, the Belkin somehow reset the bust ports on the D-link and made it 100% again. This Belkin really handles USB right.And the cable holder is great. I didn't think much about it when I bought the hub, but it really holds all the cables and makes the desk look organized."
2,Died after less than a year,"After about 11 month my hub started to shut off and on spontaneously, so that all devices are disconnected for a moment. At the beginning this happened not often, but it got worse during the last two weeks. Now it shuts off every 20 or 30 minutes. I can't use the hub anymore.I did not have problems with the hub before (it was reliable, no heat problems), but I am disappointed, that it died after less than a year. This should not happen."
1,Unreliable,"At first I had problems with it not thinking that it was plugged in (overloading the USB port on my computer), but I foregave it. Then I realized WHY it was having the issues, every time I tapped on the top of the unit AT ALL, it rebooted itself. This on a MAC is bad, especially when importing 200 gig of information :(Needless to say my faith is shaken and I will be asking for a refund to buy a more stable unit."
1,Rather unreliable and completely died after less than a year,"I used this USB hub for less than a year in total, and it was never really very reliable. My Mac would alert me that devices had been removed without being ejected properly at random times. This would sometimes happen if I bumped the hub or my desk or if I removed any device from the hub. It would also happen at random times and I would find all of a sudden a hard drive, memory stick or iPod was no longer connected. After less than 1 year using this hub it stopped working completely. It won't even provide power to my USB devices. If you are looking for a good USB hub I suggest you keep looking."
1,Defective for the 3rd time since 11/2008,"I bought the 1st one in 11/2008. It failed in 02/2009. Belkin sent a replacement but I had to pay to ship the old one back.Installed the replacement on 02/20/2009. It failed on 02/24/2009. After I complained, they sent another one with a call tag so there was no charge to me. Installed it on 03/16/2009.Now the 2nd replacement has failed (05/18/2009). Same problems, running very Hot, loses connection, etc.Submitted a complaint to the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Only a matter of time before one of these causes a fire for someone."
1,Unreliable,"Flaky connections require regular plugging and unplugging of devices before they're recognized. The whole hub died dead after less than a year, and needed to be replaced."
1,Cannot Handle Load,"The device can not handle the power consumption of the USB devices plugged into it. If I plug too many devices into the hub, they won't start. I wanted a device for the extra USB ports to handle a printer and an external hard disk, plus the occasional memory stick and camera. The printer and hard disk were intended to be on all the time. If they are, and I plug in a memory stick, the memory stick won't power up. If I shut off the printer, then the memory stick will power. On most occasions, I have to plug and unplug/replug the USB devices in the hub to get them to work. The hub is connected to an iMac, which could also be some of the problem. Bottom line - the device is useless as a multi-port solution."
2,Utter crapola,"I've now had two of these Belkin 7-port USB hubs, and I had the identical experience with both of them: namely, they performed admirably for about three months, then one or more of the ports simply crapped out. On the plus side, the hub makes it easy to realize when a port becomes defective, because its light doesn't come on. But that's small comfort for shoddy workmanship. Needless to say, no more Belkin products for me."
5,Works as advertised!,"I've had cheaper ones that did not have the power to use multiple devices.I now have a USB printer, iPod, Dymo printer, memory card reader and trackball connected and all work!"
3,Think twice before buying.,"I bought this thing about a year ago and everything seemed to be going find. I am currently using 6 of the USB plugs but just recently I've realized I have to unplug the USB from my computer during DOS and plug the thing back into the computer after windows boots up. This is getting quite annoying. Also, I'm starting to realize that some of the USB plugs are not working (i.e. my Sennheiser headset) is not being recognized by my computer. I'm not sure if it is just time to get another hub or if this is just not very well made. I think I'm going to try cables to go brand next. I've now tried several different kinds of Belkin, a Kensington, and a host of others and it looks like this particular Belkin loses in terms of longevity."
2,High Pitch Noise,"While I like the design of this product, it produces an annoying high pitched noise when charging devices like blackberries and ipods. I will likely be swapping it out to restore my sanity."
1,Over heats,"Well, I'm not sure if I got a dud or what since there are so many other positive reviews. This hub seemed to work great until one day it suddenly started rapidly cycling on and off. I picked it up and it was really really hot.This device seems to work for your regular low throughput devices like keyboards, mice, printers, etc. When I hook up my Sandisk CF card reader, or sync music with my iPhone (and charge it), it gets really hot and stops working.After I unplug it for about 15 minutes it works again.Belkin is known for making over-priced products that aren't anything special, but I often buy them anyway because I know they'll work. This isn't the case with this device. I think I'll try another brand.Your mileage may vary, of course. If you plan on hooking up a lot of demanding devices to it though, I would consider looking elsewhere."
2,Mine Died After About a Year,I bought the 7-port Belkin from a competitor. I noticed one day that my fingerpreint reader and mouse were not working. I touched the Belkin and it was very hot to the touch. I ran some testing and noticed that the Belkin had shorted out. it was good while it lasted but durability is an issue.
1,unstable,"I have had two of these now and they both drop connection a lot. This is especially true when you have them connect to a docking station. I've treid several laptops and several workstations and have the same results. I figured the first one I had was just bad, but after the second one did the same thing I'm convienced it's just not a good product."
4,Belkin 7 port USB Hub,"I really like the location of the ports and the cord organizer. I would like a different color combo, this reminds me of some sort of baby toy. It is nice to have a little weight to the hub to keep it down and from sliding around. I recommend it"
2,Add UGLY to your desktop,"This hub has got to be the ugliest one I have ever seen. While I generally have not had any problems with using Belkin hubs with my iMac, I was in desperate need for more ports. This was the only 7 port hub available at circuit city and best buy. It looks like crud sitting next to my sleek and shiny iMac. The cable keeper on the side is worthless. The top loading ports make plugging in a cruzer drive easy, but I am definitely looking for a replacement that is functional and better looking on my desktop. FYI the light stays on to indicate that the hub is powered, it does not indicate which hub is in use.4 stars for functionality, 0 stars for design (white with baby blue accent, cord keeper is too small for more than two very small cables, not sure why there is a whole in the middle)."
2,Belkin 7 port hub,"I purchased this item two years ago. I liked the low profile, and ability to organize the cables. It also has indicators for each port, so you can tell which port might be available when you have them all full, but not all being used.The device worked without any problems and did exactly what it was supposed to, right up until it stopped for no reason that I can think of. Power in my home office is all protected by an expensive UPS, so it doesn't seem like power spikes would have reached it. Nothing else appears to have failed at the same time.Great device, just wish it would have lasted longer."
5,Simple and lacks problems,"If you want feedback, blinking lights, special features then relax. The bottom line is that I plug my USB cords in, everything works, has been very reliable, and I am so satisfied that I am thinking about buying another one. 5 stars and no complaints."
2,Stops working after 8 months,"Purchased this USB hub back in April. Worked fine for 8 months.Then it died. The hub runs extremely hot. And USB devices connected to the hub randomly disconnect.Now I have to toss the USB hub I paid $$ for, and buy a new one, just so I can use my USB devices."
3,Failty Connection,This is a great hub but it took some time to get working initially. The USB connection on the hub that you plug the mini-usb plug in had a loose connection. I was so frustrated initially because nothing worked! After I hit it a few times and messed with the USB plug it started working. I believe the mini-USB jack is bent and I will probably return this item and get a new one. It is a nice compact design and would work great if it could stand to be bumped without loosing connection
1,"Electrical issues, dangerous","Worked fine for a while, then things (USB keys, cables) that were plugged into it started to get very hot. I should have gotten rid of it then, but eventually things started to fail when plugged into it. I'm finally throwing it away, and it's red hot to the touch.Looking at reviews, sounds like this is not uncommon. Avoid this device."
1,Won't buy one again,Like others I have had lots of problems with this hub. It worked fine for a while but started to get very hot and cut out the devices. I wouldn't mind except that I wasted much time unplugging and checking the devices attached to it until it dawned on me that the hub itself was faulty. I'm going to try a different make.
5,Works with MAC,"This unit works fine with my MAC desk top. I ran a 16-ft USB to it and had to use a ""B to mini-B"" adapter on the end of the cable; the adapter makes it a little tight to plug into the USB port next to the adapter port. If you are using this with the cable that comes with it, about 3-ft. long, it already has a mini-B and works fine. It uses 120-VAC power to power up all seven ports. I have not seen any decrease in speed. My MAC found the hub and the two printers connected to it when I powered back up. They don't advertise that it works with MAC and they don't mention that it connects with a mini-B plug; but it does on both counts."
4,It's OK,"I'm using this with an iMac. The hub worked well right out of the box. Two hard disk drives, keyboard, mouse, flash drives, camera, iPod, printer... All work well with this product. I just plugged it in and everything worked. I think Belkin should change the design a bit to make the hub heavier. It doesn't stay put on my desk as well as I'd like because of its light weight. I'll just add a piece of velcro to hold it."
1,Unreliable,"I bought this device about 6 months ago. It's been unreliable, and inconsistent. Sometimes it works for weeks without an issue. Sometimes it fails multiple times in the same day. Sometimes I can get it to work by unplugging all the cables and plugging them back in again. Sometimes nothing I do makes a difference, and I just have to wait for it to feel like working again. Today I bought a replacement from a different manufacturer, and tomorrow I am going to drop the Belkin off a tall building. (Not really, but I wish I could!)"
5,Great Port with a couple of minor problems,"This is an outstanding port. It's fast and can, theoretically handle 7 USB devices --- that's theoretically. In truth, the port hub can handle 5-6 devices because the connection plugs are too close together. Here's the other problem: heat. The unit is very warm when operating. This is only a problem if you put it on top of something else, like I did, initially; I put it on my external drive.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
1,poor workmanship,the craftsmanship on this product was so shoddy that it is unusable. The painting is not detailed and when you pull it out some of the glued parts start pulling apart...horrible product
4,Sweet Bird of Youth,This movie was ahead of it's time. The inuendos and the subtleness of them are wonderful. The fact that an abortion had been performed and the doctor was getting the girl as a prize is unbelieveable. Paul Newman's character is so selfish but your heart feels for him. I just loved the movie.
3,Sweet Bird of Youth (English/French version),"The film adaptation of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" elegantly portrays this classic play to the big screen during Hollywood's ""Golden Years"". Paul Newman's, Rip Torn account is both witty, empathetic and desirable, while a cast of future stars pulls along a wonderful tale of love, romance, presence, and pride."
5,You haven't seen anything yet...,"What performances, what a cast, what a movie! And what a play!A truly sadistic interwoven story about ""owners"" and ""owned"" people, with a pinch of good old prejudice and bigotry in all the right places.This is a long awaited DVD with as said, powerful performances throughout. The image is crisp, colors are vivid and the sound couldn't be more polished than this.This is no action movie, but the story flows so smoothly that it will grip you nevertheless.Highly recommended for all those who love a good transliteration of a master play into an explosive movie."
4,What a treat!,"Watching the young and electrifying Paul Newman and the mesmerizing Geraldine Page in this adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play is a real treat. It's a pity they had to change the ending of the original play (among other things) to be ""safer"" for Hollywood standards in the 60's. Still it's a great story and we keep wanting more and more and more of Newman and Page together.The short documentary on the film is also nice, with Shirley Knight, Rip Torn and Madeleine Sherwood sharing memories from the film set.The widescreen transfer is fine even if the image is not as clear as it should be."
5,Censorship didn't stop anything.,"Based on the hit Tennessee Williams play, this exciting drama stars Paul Newman as a slick young opportunist who returns to his home town with an ageing movie queen(Geraldine Page), but runs head-on into trouble with the town's corrupt boss(Ed Begley in an Oscar-winning performance). As is the case with his 1958 film version of Tennessee Williams' CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, director Richard Brooks was forced to clean up this Williams play for the movies. But those blasted censors didn't hurt anything. Like CAT, SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH is still a gritty, powerful, and brilliant film. Every one of the performers delivers a top-notch portrayal. But the film ultimately belongs to Geraldine Page whose funny and touching portrayal of the fading star is, quite simply, one of the greatest performances ever captured on film."
5,a must see.,"If you are interested in great acting and a great movie, watch this one. Geraldine Page, Madeline Sherwood, Ed Begley and Paul Newman are all first rate. The story was sanitized a bit so as not to shock an early 1960s audience (or lose Southern box office receipts), but it is still ripe with sleaze. If you miss Sweet Bird of Youth, don't profess to be a film buff."
3,Family and friend fun.,"The Singing Starz is so much fun, it has hit songs for you to sing and dancing songs too."
5,A roller-coaster ride through life with special kids,"As the adoptive mother of one child with FAE and sensory-integration disorder and another with language delays and learning differences, I have to say that I greatly enjoyed this book...Well, *enjoyed* isn't quite the right word, is it? Empathized, sympathized, identified, learned, felt sad, felt mad, felt relieved that someone else could feel so clueless--all of those are closer to the mark. The experience of thinking everything is all figured out followed by the realization that things are still not right is a very familiar one, and it's great to see it captured in print so that parents like me can show it to other people and say, ""See, I'm not the only one who's gone through this! I'm not nuts!"" It's a tremendously empowering read for those who are on the same roller-coaster of life with challenging children, and an enlightening parent's-eye view for those who are watching from the ground."
3,its a CD,i only ordered this cd because it contains my wedding song and my original cd broke. it wasnt worth the price but i was desparate
3,"A Good CD, But Maybe Not Worth It","I like the cd, but it's certainly not as good as Anytime. Most of the songs have a repetitive theme, and the one stand out song, One Last Cry, can still be found on single."
4,Good for kids,"We purchased this when our 4th grader needed a mystery book for a book report (public school). We're not in favor of all the mystical junk and other content that today's society calls, ""For kids"". While the stories can get a little crazy, it fits the adventure that's in the heart of boys and it's relevant to their level. You can read a lot about the author and his inspiration and hopefully you choose these for your kids. BTW - the first book was for the book report and in only 2 weeks following completion my son is now on to the 4th book of the series. That speaks for itself. The only negative is some of the slang used by the author. While it fits for the characters and the story, it sometimes requires young readers to re-read a sentence multiple times to break through the slang. We recommend these books as a good choice that fills the desire for adventure while also teaching good morals and character through the adventures and life lessons of the Sugar Creek Gang."
5,i luv this book,when Ed machado came to our school with this book i imeadieatley started reading it and i loved it! i have read it like 10 times
4,Where did he go wrong??,"One Tree Island was a great book, but it had some flaws. No two siblings could ever get along for that period of time even if their lives depended on it! Also Shane and Shela are 15 years old so I think that when they would be searching for someone out in the ocean they would remember that their Uncle John would have drifted with the current for a while and he would be in the exact spot that he fell out in. So what I am trying to say is that Ed Machado made the book a little too childish."
4,"She's not the KING, but a fine Queen.","I've just rec'd ""Everybody's Favorite"" and I'm sure she would be if she got more exposure than the Jenny Jones show where I first got turned on to her. The cd has all original material and a guest appearance by Koko Taylor. Ms. Queen hasa good voice and does a fine job on lead guitar. It's a good cd to kick back and listen to, though not the crying in your beer type. It would be a good gift item to give someone to expand their blues library. I'll listen to it often."
3,3.5 stars,"Sam and the crew he picks up along the way are diverse and delightful. Although the dialogue is weak in points and the plot fairly light, it is definitely the characters that drive this book. I am definitely going to follow Sam and the crew to see where their adventures take them as this looks to be a very enjoyable new series."
4,Excellent product..arrived broken twice.,"This is just the touch I wanted in my newly redone kitchen. However, the set came the first time with one broken piece. Amazon reissued another set at no charge and did not require return shipping of the original (broken glass). Great..except the second set also came partially broken...I did receive enough via the shipments to make up the original set."
1,Disappointment,The canisters were sent to me on two seperate occassions; both times the wrong sized product. The last order one of the canisters was broken. I still await credit. At no point in time did I receive an email of concern. Customer service clearly dropped the ball.
4,Highly Recommended!,I bought these canisters at a chefs store while I was on vacation and when I got them home I fell in love witht hem and wanted more so that's when I orded them from Amazon. The were at my house withing a couple of days and they were packaged very well. The canisters looke really nice no matter what you put in them and I get many compliments on them. So I now have 8 canisters with a variety of cooking stuff in each one I love it because you can see what it is before even opening it...They are great!
2,Not all leather,"The way the add looked you were getting two LEATHER halters, you only get one. Plus it is not all leather."
2,"I know Headhunter is horrible, but check out Black Fist","Black Fist is a pretty decent blaxploitation movie with Richard Lawson and a pretty young Dabney Coleman. It is not well written, certainly not well done at all, but Lawson and Coleman really make this a watchable movie. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.Headhunter is probably the reason you bought this. I didn't know what I found worse: the dialogue or the action. Rosumand Kwan is nice to look at but if you make it through the whole 92 minutes of this movie, you are a real trooper.Both of these movies you can find in the martial arts 50 movie pack released by treeline films and both are kind of bad picture quality but Head Hunter is widescreened. Like it mattered."
4,Excellent detailed information book on astonomy,"Well, it's a little out of date now , but this is still an excellent book for information on astrononmy up to the time period and the historical beginns of thscience. There's lots of great pictures and iullstrations. It's very comprehensive. However, it's a little hard to sit down with and read at times because of it's very large size."
3,My son loves this transformer but it was really overpriced,It is an impressive looking toy but it really doesn't do that much. The only reason it is so much fun to me is because it makes my son so happy. He thinks it is really cool but in my mind at over $100 it should have been a lot more exciting. If Grandma and Papa hadn't been paying for it he wouldn't have gotten it.
3,The horror! The horror! OMGosh it's so awful!,"LOL. Anyway, this is my first film by Donte Tomeselli, and I'm not really interested in his other films after seeing this. I liked the dreamlike, surreal quality of the story, but it somehow didn't live up to all the hype it generated. I guess I was just expecting more. It's not an awful movie, but not amazing or original either...just ok and some parts were pretty freaky (i.e. under the bed and that goat *shudders*)."
5,Your damnation draweth nigh.,"Dante Tomaselli's ""Horror"" is a chilling portrait of five damned souls standing before Hell's open gates and gaping at the terrors that are stretched out before them. Logic is swept in a flood of bizarre and frightening imagery (a sinister black goat, leering, demonic jack 'o lanterns, legions of the undead), leaving the viewer just as frightened and confused as the characters. The film is a puzzle. Those seeking an easy answer, or any answer for that matter, will be sorely disappointed. Tomaselli exhibits great courage as a filmmaker in this age of happy endings and by-the-numbers scripts with easy to comprehend themes. Those willing to take this hellish journey will find much to like, and be frightened by, in ""Horror."" It is a scary little film that will get under your skin and haunt you long after it has ended. See this film... if you dare!"
5,If you love Dante's movies...,"Dante Tomaselli truly outdid himself with Horror. The strangely beautiful imagery is what makes his movies truly disturbing, and therefore truly effective. I really think that this director is going places.From what I understand, Dante is being considered for directing the new ""Halloween 9"". I believe that a big-budget horror movie in the hands of Dante Tomaselli could easily wind up a classic of the genre. There is a petition here: http://www.petitiononline.com/dth9/petition.html that you can sign if you'd like to see that too. If you love his movies so far, imagine what he could do with a big budget."
4,A film for (early) David Lynch fans...,"If you enjoyed ""Eraserhead"" and thus don't really have-to-know exactly what's going on at all times during a film... then you are in for a treat. Tomaselli definitely has a style of his own (with only 2 films - that I am aware of) and even though constricted by a limited budget and actors that range from promising (Lizzy Mahon) to down-right bad (most of the rest) has created a truly fascinating dream-like entertainment... I honestly couldn't take my eyes off the screen right from the start! A lot of very informative extras are included on this disc (Elite EE6666) with a Director's commentary that completly 'fills-in-the-holes' (story-wise) for those viewers that require such. The 5.1 audio remix is also a definite plus for it enhances the experience greatly.Now if only a smart Producer would give Mr. Tomaselli carte blanche to create the masterpiece that I know he is capable of... much like Alfredo Leone did for Mario Bava and ""Lisa and the Devil."""
2,Don't watch before bed!,"This film is plodding, incoherent, and put me to sleep two nights in a row. Sure there are some frightening visuals (not as crazy as Desecration's scissor scene, however) and an eerie circular plot structure, but this film is just hard to get pulled in by. I kept wanting to pay attention and get ""into"" the story, but I found it too out-there to follow. I'm very glad to hear that Tomaselli's new film ""Satan's Playground"" will have a strong script and a plot that the audience will be able to follow. Buy this film if you like; however, I do expect you will be a bit disappointed in this sophomore effort from a hopefully soon-to-be-great filmmaker."
1,Save your money,"Dont bother wasting your money on this low budget movie. Besides Kreskin the acting was terrible. The story line is hard to follow, and isn't really that good to begin with. I have no idea why people are hyping Tomaselli, his work is cr*p. I wish I could get my money back."
4,The first review? I am surprised.,"In an era which many consider to be a wasteland of traditional roots reggae and the long years after the departure of the reggae songwriters, Lucky Dube is a find. Though the album was released in 1990, the songs will song fresh on first listen today. Dube's music on Prisoner is highly polished, and the powerful and smooth female vocal back-up singers are used on every track. The closest comparison to Dube is Tosh. He has a voice similar to Tosh and the music is more highly produced than Marley, like many of Tosh's tracks. Prisoner is a classic and difficult for anyone not to like. Each song has a melodic hook. Women love Remember Me. The first five tracks are among the strongest on any reggae album. The album misses 5 stars as the last three tracks are weaker. This is a must own for the fan of traditional, song-based reggae."
5,Delights from the Garden of Eden,"This is the second copy that I have ordered because I gave mine away as a gift. I love this cookbook, and although there is not any color photos the author does a good job of explaining. I would tell anyone who is a food lover to get this book. It is full of wonderfull recipes,as well as indepth history of origin."
4,A classic tale from a different vantage point,"This tale makes one feel as if they are actually living through a dinosaur, thinking with it's predacious mind and feeling with it's reptillian senses. Oddly enough, the feeling isn't like being trapped inside a stupid cow- Bakker conveys the stealthy raptor as an intelligent rouge, a nomadic hunter which will do anything it has to to survive. A perfect find for all the Jurassic Park fans out there!"
5,ausome,i loved this book it is the story of a ferocious predator a caring mother a loving sister and a lover. i like how berk shows that even though she is a predator she is constantly hunted by other carnovors please write another 1
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Raptor romance?Bakker, an eminent palaeontologist has come up with a novel. Basically, a life study as he follows the travels and adventures, if you can call if that, of a female of the velociraptor species. If that sort of realistic animal tale appeals, then you will perhaps like this book a bit more than I did. I like Bakker's other work, have read his papers etc., but this was a bit blah."
3,Storys,"The book, Raptor Red, was a thrilling tale on life during the Jurassic era. With the story being told through a raptor, you believe you become one. Robert Bakker made this book inspire creative writers to write the most unimagined story ever."
5,I'd give it more stars than 5!!,"I thought this book was really awesome! I first heard the audio tape on a trip to FL. I thought it was really good and not too long after that, my dad bought it for me. I've read it over and over. I think it's pretty cool what Bakker did, what with it not having dialoge and all. The animal talking stuff can get old if you read enough books with that in it. Bakker just tells it as it is, he tells us what's happening and what Raptoer Red thinks. I think it's a refreshing way to read. I really feel like I'm back in prehistoric times, hunting right there with the raptors."
5,An insight of Utahraptor's life,"Raptor Red is an emotional book. Even though it took place 120 million years ago, it is told as though it was happening right now. Robert Bakker really gets into the personal lifestyle of a dinosaurian predator, and other prehistoric animals as well. Raptor Red (the main character) lives a wonderfully colorful life, filled with emotion and real-life cicumstances. Each raptor has its own personality, creating different moods at different points in the story. The story even teaches morals, if you look for them. I'm only 13, and I first read this book at 12. Although it is an adult book, Robert Bakker wrote this book in a way I could easily understand. I highly recommend this story to anyone who loves dinosaurs, and to anyone who is weighed down by life."
5,Can't stop reading it.,"I enjoyed this book very much, mostly because I am interested in prehistoric life, and I believe this added a nice insight into what the possibilities were for a dinosaur to see, feel, and think. This book also seemed to parallel modern society, because there is that constant want to improve their own situation and dominate in whatever you endeavor. In addition to this, this book also shows how, when faced with change, people, or in the book's case, dinosaurs, freeze because of the uncertaintly of what to do, as was seen with the flowers. What I really like about this book is that it never gets old to me, because every time I reread it, a new detail seems to appear that I overlooked, which enhances my reading experience."
4,"Animal Channel, 100 Million BC","This book was a lot of fun. It reads like a TV show with the narrator telling you about animals' behavior and life histories as you ""watch"" them take down prey, court a mate, raise babies, and do other things you see in animal documentaries. That's great, because nobody can go to modern day Utah and film the beasts that lived there long ago. The book does show its age, however, by having no feathers on its dinosaurs. More recent dino-fiction, like Hopp's Dinosaur Wars, describes fully feathered raptors. So even dino-fiction evolves. All and all though, Raptor Red was an enlightening read."
2,a failed attempt,"i know bakker is an authority on dinosaurs, and i'm sure his nonfiction books are excellent to read, but he is not a fiction writer. and it shows in this book. i know what he wanted to do, but he should have left that job up to those who make a living writing. the text jumps between a narrative account and a documentary. the language falls flat, and without human characters, bakker is unable to make raptor red interesting. it's a nice try, but instead of this book, pick up one of bakker's nonfiction pieces and one of crichton's novels."
1,"Great premise, disappointing book","Baker tried to bite off more than he can chew. He began with a great premise; present a dinosaur's story without romanticizing and ""Disneyfing"" it.But it takes a great writer to be able to write an engaging book which uses an animal's limited pallette of emotions. Unfortunately, I do not believe Bakker is that author. The characters are uneffecting and the events are unexciting. This book has no driving narrative and becomes a pointless prehistoric travelogue.After reading this book, I don't feel like I have any better understanding of what a dinosaur's life might have been like.On the other hand, it is still ten times better than Jurasic Park."
1,"Bakker should make low-budget movies, instead.","If you would like to know about dinosaurs, please read anotherbook. Raptor Red is a highly unbelievable story. It's just thetale of sophomoric Bakker's favorite dinosaurs: the bigger thebetter. ""The science suffers at the expense of entertainment."""
1,Raptor Red sucks!,What was Bakker thinking when he wrote this book? Was he thinking straight? THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!! I don't know why so many people gave this book good reviews. WORDS OF WISDOM:reading this book is a very bad idea
5,Extremely exiting and interesting book!,"One of my friends let me borrow Raptor Red, saying it was her favorite book. Boy, when I read it, I could tell why she read it nine times over! I don't want to give it back now! This book is definitely one in a million. The whole book is seen through Rapror Red's opinion and veiws. I used to be totally into dinosaurs, and this book gave me a whole new outlook on how they think and act. The book lets you in on all of her thoughts and how her life is. I thoroughly enjoyed Raptor Red!"
5,"This is an extraordinarily good book, one of my favorites.",I loved this book. Dr. Bakker creates a picture in your mind that you won't easily forget. I read this book over and over and I am constantly fascinated with its realism. I would and do recommend this book to nearly everyone I know.
5,read this:,"If you don't like this book, you have really poor taste! I think that this book is good and realistic because it doesn't have a main theme like some kids books, but it shows the life of a dinosaur. and has some interesting characters. It seems to me that everyone either absolutely loves it, or absolutely hates it, with very little in-betweens. First of all, you have to be a pretty good reader if you're a kid. It comes to my attention that a lot of people who hate this book seem to be kids. Anyway... if you're not sure if you're the right person for this book, look at all the reviews, and figure out if you're closer in personality to the people who hate this book, or the people who like it."
3,I was assigned to read Raptor Red,For geology class we were assigned to read this book and I thought that it would be boring and like a text book. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasnt this way. I am not a big dino lover but this book was fairly entertaining and very readable. it gives you a vivid glimpse of what life might have been like for these animals. It wasnt the worst book I have had to read for school!
5,Paleontology has never been so alive!!,"Raptor Red is the story of the days of dinosaurs as seen through the eyes of a female Utahraptor. Her life consists of love, family, migration, and combating the elements and natural environment that surrounds her. You ""feel"" her hunger, pain, cold, fear, and family love. The one drawback to this book is that Robert Bakker is not a novelist, but rather a noted paleontoligist. At times the words used to describe the situation are more scientific, and tend to interrupt the reading flow of the story. But as you read this book realize that you are really hearing new paleontoligic theories in a most interesting manner. You will find that by the time you finish this book you have new ideas of how the dinosaurs lived and died, and that you have enjoyed the story in the process"
5,best book if you want to be in the eyes of a raptor,"back when i was in like 8th grade, which was quite a long time ago i read this book, i couldnt understand it well at first and read it again, i liked it so much after reading it the second time and getting the full idea, there are some times were it gets off the subject of raptor red. but it somehow relates it to the full story. i find this book a little challanging and suggest reading it more than once.i read it quite a few times, and to this day, it is my favorite book."
5,Exciting Point of View of Life as a Raptor......Very Real!,"This book captures your imagination of being a raptor, living, surviving day to day. Very exciting, you become the raptor itself and your imagination takes you there! Well written! Read it!"
4,Raptor Red takes you inside the 'brain' of a Dinosaur!,"As a first cousin of Dr. Bob Bakker, I bought his best-selling book, Raptor Red with happiness. I was excited to read it after reading and seeing Jurassic Park (and knowing that he had imput into the movie). I thought the book was good, with a good plot. I am NOT a Dinosaur maniac, but it really helped me to understand certain things about them. I have students at school (Jr. Hi.) who are 'into' Dinosaurs, and they are enthusiastically reading this book! I hope that Dr. Bob will write another one soon!"
4,I was sent the wrong figure.,"I clearly ordered the ""masked"" version of this action figure, butreceived the ""unmasked"" version... I am very disappointed! to in th in the picture."
5,OFF DA CHAIN!!!!!!,"most rapper r known to be from new york or new jersey, but this cat here from boston, mass........this is an mc ppl have slept on! this album was one of the tightest i had heard in 1991, i was still in high school at the time. too bad he didn't get the airplay nor the props he deserved. i bought the tape when he first came out, years later, i bought the cd and i still listen to it to this day. my personal fav on this album besides ""i gotta have it"", is ""gotta have money"", he's speaking of nothing but the stone truth on that track! i believe if he made a comeback with his rappin skills and had somebody like swiss beats, kanye west and or the neptunes putting their hands on the album.....it'll definitely go platinum!"
4,Very different from the famous film...,"I was about 17 years old when the famous film ""9 and 1/2 weeks"" was released. The film is steamy and passionate. Now, at the age of 39, I decided to read the novel that inspired the movie. This was so different. Sad in a way. The love affair that she endured was painful, emotionally and physically.Good book, just Very different than what the film portrays."
4,A Lasting Story,"This book has survived the test of time and beats ""50 Shades of Gray"" for content and writing. Supposedly a true story, the book takes you through Nine and a Half Weeks of a sado-masochistic love affair that ends in tragedy. While it is slow to get going, once the affair begins, it is a non-stop ""tour de force"" of the world of one-on-one S&M.; I highly recommend this to anyone who has read ""50 Shades"" as it shows how good writing can enhance a book such of this type.C. R. Melcher"
3,Meh...,"Alright, I thought the movie was sexy but I have mixed feelings about the book. I'm super open-minded and not shocked easily, but what was described as S&M really seemed to me more of an abusive relationship. The narrator didn't feel much like an intelligent, empowered woman exploring her sexuality as much as someone who had fallen under the power of a manipulative, violent man (who would beat her for example or force her into rough sex). Some parts were titillating, but at the end it left me feeling a bit repulsed."
3,It's okay,the book was in great condition and arrived in a timely manner. I usually prefer the books over the movies but in this case I liked the movie a lot more than the book.
5,So much hotter than the movie,"This is supposedly a 'memoir.' I'm not sure I buy that, but it's a really hot book and probably much better than the pulp BDSM stuff people are yammering about. Short, powerfully written, and if true, deeply honest. Great book to read in bed. With someone, I mean. Er.... let me stop before I embarrass myself further."
4,9 1/2 weeks,"I really liked this book, it had some mystery and suspence. Well written.We are reading this book for our Monthly Book Club."
2,Not Impressed,I found the writing style to be very disjointed. I enjoyed the movie but can see that they could not follow this book as it would not be commercially acceptable. The book is quite short so it is not a big commitment in time but still not worth my while.
3,STRANGE,"I loved the movie 9 1/2 weeks but after reading this book I realize that I love it because of Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. I guess looking at the two of them is what makes the movie so appealing to me and not the whole S&M thing. If you're in to that then I guess you'll love this book. If not, stick to the movie!"
2,Go for the movie.,"This is a very short book, and one of the rare cases where the movie was better than the book."
3,Not F1 2003 with career mode.,Things not in this game.#1 no driving assists#2 no basic handling method (so steering is super touchy)#3 no straight season for just racing#4 no difficulty settingsOtherwise the game looks good to go but looks to be cut throat hard.
2,Only partially works,"As a dedicated F1 fan, I was looking forward to seeing my name on then podium, as the game promised. But, here's the big kicker, you have to pass a series of tests to be eligible to compete. And the game will NOT remember that you passed the next to last test (a series of S-turns in the rain) so you have to take it every time you open it. (It'll take foreover to pass ...) The last test is a pit stop test over which you have no real control and it will NOT let you pass (I wasted 4 hours on this). The quick race section is okay but the whole point of it - to mix it up with Schumi and the boys - is moot. The @#%#$@ gamers who designed it fixed it so that you won't pass the entry tests."
2,not good at all,"Well what can I say....It's easy,it cheats it's horrible.Im still waiting for a good F1 game."
1,The WORST F1 game by Ea,That kid who said this game is good. get the hell of the internet. The graphics are very poor. the F1 cars crash into you. Ea is the crappest games company ever. they never did anything bad on Burnout 3 whch WILL be released in september. F1 Challenge '99-'02 is an excellent game. when i have it. i will stick to that. Just avoid
3,So so Soto,"If you are a practitioner of Soto Zen Buddhism, then you will appreciate the direction of this book - sitting on your bum is the supreme expression of enlightenment, and anything else is a lesser practice.For the rest of the Zen world (Yes Mr. Merzel, there are other ""Zen"" sects out side of Japan - not everyone is either Soto or Rinzi) there is still enough meat to make the book worth reading."
3,Not Anderson's Best,"This book displays some of the best and worst aspects of Anderson's writing. The basic story idea and many aspects of the background are very good. An imaginative use of what were then relatively new discoveries and ideas in cosmology, very clever constuction of alternative species, and a relatively interesting future history. Unfortunately, there is also a good deal of stilted prose, clumsy attempts at eroticism, and a rather strange combination of simpleminded libertarianism and new-agish pantheism. All of these defects occur in some of Anderson's other books, but not in such concentrated form. Aspects of this book were recycled from an earlier and better Anderson novel - Tau Zero."
2,Too stereotyped,A fairly standard plot with some good ideas is marred by excessively predictable stereotype figures (the Brave Buccaneer; the Wicked Politician; the Dutiful Soldier) and by phoney dialogue (notably the dreadful stage Irishisms). What characterization Anderson attempts here is unconvincing. He has written far better than this.
4,i enjoyed this film,I love going to the Tate Modern and really enjoyed learning about how it came to life. Herzog and de Meruon are amazing at what they do- i think this doco really shows that.
4,It's more than you think,"To say that Native is a coming-of-age novel does not do it justice. Yes, our main character discovers something about himself. Yes, he grows up. But that's not all.Henderson's expert use of landscape and scenery not only reflects the characters' internal struggles, it also puts you smack dab in the middle of the beautiful Wyoming ranch. The story contains enough action to balance the introspection, but not so much as to overshadow the true battles for self-acceptance. The well-rounded characters are both realistic and larger-than-life.The language flows smoothly throughout most of the book, and in fact is as much a part of the experience as the story itself. You cannot ignore the exquisitely crafted prose, and that annoyed me on occasion because it distracted me from the story.Henderson's second novel will be released in the fall of 1997. If it lives up to the promise shown in Native, Henderson is well on his way to literary acclaim."
3,Pilot light goes out during the summer months,My hot water heater is only about 2 years old. It started right after it was installed. The hot summer months the pilot was going out at least once a week. Already this year it's not summer yet but the attic is very hot. The pilot light is going out. Stays lite after you relight it but will likely go out again in about a week or when ever it goes out. I wish someone would reply to this and let me know what you think is going on. I think it is the heat in the attic that is shutting the pilot light off. This must be a safety thing. Other than that the hot water heater is fine.
2,Average CD/DVD Case - Rebate DOES NOT work,The leather is ok in quality. Stitching is just average and the zipper is cheap quality. I bought this product from amazon thinking for 15 bucks (after rebate) you cannot get better quality but guess what - I ended up paying the full amount for this average stuff because my rebate was DENIED by the company stating that the UPC code is invalid. How can this be? In my opinion this REBATE thing is a HUGE SCAM. Please stay away and invest your hard earned money elsewhere.
2,"Case nice, but zipper broken","The zipper was broken from the moment I took it out of the box. I considered sending it back, but I figured it would work without the zipper. Still, it was poor quality."
4,"Good, large case...a little hard to use.","Great deal for $8-10 after rebate. Plenty of room and reasonably secure storage of disks. However, the zipper that is used to close the case is a little hard to get hold of when you try to close the cae. It gets lost in the folds of the open case. Inevitable, I suppose. Looks reasonably durable, too."
3,It does its job,I have no major complaints. It's big and it holds all of my dvds. So that's good. I have had minor problems with the zipper and I can foresee future problems with it. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,"Two albums, same destiny",I purchased two of these albums. First week: 1st album zipper broke. 3rd week: 2nd album zipper broke. It is impossible to repair. The zipper breaks when one wishes to use the last 5-10 pages. The album strains to open than far. Even with caution the tension separates the zipper. POOR DESIGN!
4,I liked it so much i am buying another right now,Finally a cheap but sturdy case.. I have over 800 movies and i threw out every single original case and decided i was going to have room for all my movies without the clutter. I have spent hundreds trying to find a dvd folder that fits me. thanks etremejuli pilato
1,Poor quality - avoid,I have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased. I would avoid this brand.[...]
1,Vanishing Editor,"""Vanishing Victory"" suffers from a serious need for an editor. There were numerous cases of incomplete sentences, incoherent sentences, improper punctution, etc. It was very distracting when trying to read. Further, the author rambled and repeated his opinions over and over in the same chapter; I got it the first time!! The numerous repititions seemed to be a case if I say it often enough, you'll believe it. This leads to my opinion that this book was NOT very well researched. The author makes many asertions not supported by any works already accomplished. He indicates a familiarity with horses but his analysis, while partially correct as to fatigue, is not consistent with other better researched works or my own experience with horses.I would not recommend purchasing this book until an editor gets hold of it. Otherwise, it adds to the very large literature library purporting to be the ""truth"" about the Little Bighorn, and we should all be open to new opinions."

1,The Error of Wootten's Theory,"I would recommend to all interested in this book: Read the Bible to find out that the theory described in this book (the ""two house theory"") is completely erroneous. It is in error for the following reasons: 1. flawed, unwarranted, and dangerous interpretation of scripture 2. inconsistent logic and contradictions 3. racist and race-based theology 4. theology that functions in the same way as supersessionism 5. historically inaccurate depictions of Israel 6. dangerous, false, and militant claims to the land which threaten the stability of the current State of Israel For more info: search for ""Ephraimite Error"" on the www."
1,Look somewhere else.,"I believe this book does a diservice to both Jew and Gentile. Mrs. Wootten's interpretation of certain scripture passages isn't based on the actual Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, but on a pre-conceived idea of how Gentiles can become ""Jews"",or ""Ephraimites"" as she puts it. If someone is looking for good Biblical insight and understanding, they need to look somewhere else. Several weeks ago Mrs. Wooten, after reading several negative reviews of this book on this web site, asked the people on her e-mail list to come to Amazon in order to write a positive review which would give an impression that many people enjoyed this book. I feel that this is very manipulative and dishonest."
5,Exellent Book,"This book states the scriptures and conclusion of what the scriptures say clearly; so that you can see for yourself the truth found therein, not by supposition, but by details of word meanings and confirming it by similar verses throughout the Old and New Covenant. It is like a breath of fresh air because you don't see this subject addressed very often. Any one who is in question of the position stated within,""Who Is Israel, And Why You Need To Know"" would benefit from looking up every scripture that is quoted in this book and see for yourself the exciting news. I would recommend for anyone who reads this book (or any book or paper that someone has written) to search it out for themselves. I highly recomend Batya Wootten's book concerning Israel and who we are! It is very clear, easy to read and to understand."
5,Best Book I've ever read except for the Bible!,This is a must read book for all Christians and Jews. My wife and I have been involved in ministry for several years and have never had the Old Testament be so understandable until we grasped the concepts put forth in this book. It is very scriptural and accurate contrary to what some would like you to believe. It is not anti-semitic as some would suggest. Just the opposite. Those who bash the book I believe have either not read the whole book or have a hidden agenda of their own. Read it for yourself and let the Spirit of the Lord lead you into Truth.
4,Excellent Handbook for those beginning to return,"I have read the book and the reviews. I do not ever before recall reading such vicious attacks upon a work as those against this book. This alone should make the book worth reading.The book itself is written well and leads to conclusions that can only be verified by the Rauch HaKodesh (Holy Spirit). Full understanding of this subject can only be given by revelation through the Rauch HaKodesh.As the book says and implies, it is a time of great change, a time of increasing knowledge and a time of awakening. The book presents for consideration an alternative to conventional and traditional thinking. Having been steeped in what we have been told to be true, all our lives, it is sometimes difficult to open our eyes and hearts and minds to grasp a deeper meaning and truth. This book offers understanding and hope coupled with revelation. It was the beginning of greater understanding for me and my household."
1,A Subtle Form of Anti-semitism,"The premise of this book, that everyone who is saved is really Jewish, is ludicrous at best, and at worst is a particularly shrewd, yet subtle, form of anti-semitism. The author bases her doctrine of the two houses of Israel (Ephraim being the Gentiles, and the other, Judah, being the Jews) on nothing more than the mis-translation of several passages of scripture. The believer must question the details of Mrs. Wooten's education in the Hebrew language before blindly accepting a belief system based on such blatently erroneous translation. The concept set forth in the book, that every believer is physical Israel, is also insidiously anti-semitic because it's an especially crafty type of Replacement Theology. This is, quite frankly, a book that cannot be taken seriously."
1,Junk junk Junk can I say it anymore,This is one game that sucks. the controls are bad and the graphics really are not that great. it feels like you driveing a box with wheels but any way if you wanna buy go ahead I warned ya. So I give it one damn star
4,Still Uncertain,I just had this installed and while I love the remote start convenience and the security provided by the alarm...I'm having a few issues. An alarm keeps going off on the remote with the screen. Every time we run out to the car only to find that the car alarm is NOT going off. I cannot find any explanation for this in the manual or online and I am almost at my wit's end about what to do...as are my dogs!
4,been searching for years for one of these,"why do they sell squeegys with taper fit handles, but sell squeegy poles with threaded ends. I guess its the same reason they sell 10 hotdogs and 8 buns.It fits and never let go the whole day."
1,Dead On Arrival,Product never worked from the time the package was opened. No matter how many times the batteries were changed or the codes reset the results were the same. Took 2 1/2 months to credit my account once the item was sent back. Bought a similar item from local hardware store for $10.00 less and it works great!
3,Mostly Pros,"Pros: Great sound, easy install, and great concept.Cons: Button hard to press so, most door guest think they have pressed the door bell but actually have not. They say on the second or third try it worked.Actually we have a Rat Terrier Dog named Gracie and she barks at anyone even near our door so it's not a big deal."
3,Deborah Gibson Best Part Of The Film,I am a big Deborah Gibson Fan and i havethe film it is a really cheesy movie butthere are some great part's in the filmlike when Deborah is fighting with herhusband in the film she have's a cryingscene and it really hit's you hard. Thereis a part where Deborah sing's a song in thefilm and they removed it it should have stayed.And the other star's are all so great the filmwill make you laugh and cry. But the best thingto make this movie make it is DEBORAH GIBSON!!!!So if your a Deb Fan you need this film. A lot ofpeople do not know that it was released on DVD andthey are still trying to find it so thank You toAmazon.com for having this DVD on there website.
3,READ THE FINE PRINT,Product was in great condition except it was without artwork or original case. Make sure and read the comments on condition before purchase.
3,What was it?,"I recently got this dvd and I dont know why. I think I saw the preview and always wanted to get it, and plus it was free. The guys from Super Troopers were in it too, but this movie had no real comedy at all. It was just like a cheap horror movie with a typical plot-horny guys and girls, drugs, stupid jokes, a lame killer, lots of deaths, if you know horror movies the plot is old and tiresome. Very unorignal, should be called a horror movie. This is far from a comedy movie, like everyone says. Maybe its a comedy because its so bad? Oh, and the unrated version? I cannot begin to imagine what is in that, this movie had so many cuss words and nudity but the deaths weren't detailed well, so they probably show that more I guess."
2,Poor excuse for a movie.,"To the people giving this movie 5 stars; How are you Paul, Jay, Kevin, Erik, and Steve?. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. I had to watch Super Troopers to cleanse the palate afterwards. And I kept an open mind, mind you. The two stars are for the gratuitous nudity (Penelope especially) and Bill Paxton's hilarious turn as an angry phony."
2,kill me,what the hell is this it sucks bad not funny it's just poor poor movie oh ya if your looking for a nude Brittany Daniel it's not gonna happen the dvd box my suck you in but no nude Brittany Daniel sorry prvs oh ya the unrated bullcrap not a good movie stay away from it if you know what's good for you lol but dont buy it it's crap
4,Coconut Pete is the man,"Man we got it all here. Oversexed youngsters on an island paradise and a crazed killer. This mystery comedy will keep you guessing until the last minute. Is it the cute gymnist girl from Alaska or the hot blond aerobics instructor? Can Coconut Pete remember the lyrics to his own songs to find clues of who may be killed next? Will the poor guy with the bad dreadlock wig continue to have weird dreams about himself?I won't give away the killer's ID, but this killer refuses to die and has the heart of Jason Voorhees. After being stabbed, and cut in half, the killer keeps coming all ther way up until the final scene where it's just a pair of legs swimming in the water trying to catch the survivors."
4,Hilariously funny,"I liked this movie very much. Not only did I find Broken Lizards writing fabulous, their acting abilities were excellent. This movie had everything you could ask for: comedy, horror and slap-stick adult humor. I hope they make a Club Dread Part 2 some time in the future."
1,Uhh... hmm... Super Troopers was MUCH better,"I'll try to make a shorter review...""Super Troopers"" was a damn fine hilarious movie. Highly underrated, I might add. Now our comedy team ""Broken Lizard"" churns up this ""horror-comedy"" called ""Club Dread.""I guess you can call it a satire of slasher flicks, but we already have ""Scream."" I wanted to laugh in ""Club Dread,"" I really did... but not one chuckle came up. It keeps the horror (badly, I might add), but doesn't live up to comedy.Hmm... don't know what else to write. ""Clud Dread"" just isn't very good. You're better off with ""Super Troopers."""
3,Not What I Expected...,"The moment I watched Super Troopers I thought it was the funniest movie ever, and when I heard that the makers where making a new title ""CLUB DREAD"" I couldn't wait at all! Although I have to admit some parts were funny...the movie was just plain lame and boring. I only laughed outloud once. What happened? Usually I like all movies but hey, it's worth a see!*3 1/2 stars*"
4,Ya Maaan!,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodHilarious black comedy spoof on the slasher genre! Quite juvenille, but hey, we were all juveniles once!Bill Paxton steals the show as an aging hippie, & head island bumblebutt, of a whole herd of island bumblebutts, who are getting wacked, one by one.Which one of these bumblebutts will get wacked next? Which one of these bumblebutts is the killer???Watch & die of laughter, or disgust, depending on how juvenille you are?"
3,Rob,"Not the worst Broken Lizard Group movie I've seen, but not the best, either. If you are in to ""B"" type movies, this is probably for you. Pretty much a ""B"" rated Horror flick with some comedy thrown in to the mix."
1,"i loved supertroopers, but this sucks monkeyballs","i shelled out good money to see this in the theater on opening night. i fear the broken lizard team ran thru all their good stuff in supetroopers. Club Dread is a lousy excuse for a comedy. It's only funny in a few spots, and is otherwise pretty boring. This movie may only be funny to broken lizard."
1,This movie was DREADFUL,I mean I am not some sort of movie snob who will only see art-house movies or anything like that but I just found this movie unwatchable. Out of the 3 friends I watched it with nobody liked it. Luckily I rented it!
1,This Movie was a Waste,I just finished watching this movie. The movie wasn't that very good. If I were you I would stick with Super Troopers instead.
4,son of a son of a bitch,"I personally think this movie is better than most do. It may not be as funny as Super Troopers but it is rather entertaining. I find Bill Paxton's second-rate Jimmy Buffet character Coconut Pete to be absolutely hysterical. The film serves its purpose of having little plot and some good laughs very well, but if your expecting some sort of artistic genius here stay away."
3,Somewhat enjoyable romp from Broken Lizard troupe,"Whether or not you liked Broken Lizard's last film, 2002's cult hit Super Troopers, and depending on how low brow you like your comedy, will determine how muh you like Club Dread. The five members play various counselors for washed up rocker Coconut Pete (Bill Paxton, played with wonderful comedic abandon) on his Pleasure Island, where the staff and the vacationers gleefully throw their inhibitions to the wind. However, there is a machete wielding killer on the loose, and for a horror-spoof the violence is surprisingly extreme. Full of blood and copious female nudity, the one thing Club Dread is lacking is in the laugh department. It has it's moments, but the best laughs undoubtadly come from Paxton and the insanely hot Brittany Daniel. All in all, if you dug Super Troopers, Club Dread is worth a look, but all others may want to proceed with caution."
3,Great!!!,not knowing much or anything really about Broken Lizard troupe I throughly enjoyed Supertroopers and had to check Club Dread it will not let you down at all incredibly funny and it was a nice suprise to see these cast members play parts other than whacky cops. I recommend completely!
3,NOT TOO BAD...,"It's not near as good as ""Super Troopers,"" but it's not that bad either. I thought it lagged a lot in some parts, but it did have its moments. It's worth watching at least once. Get the unrated version if possible."
3,Funny...but not as funny as you'll hope.,"Super Troopers was a surprise to us all. I mean come on..who has ever thought of saying ""A litre of cola""?I liked Club Dread. But I like 'B' movies also. If you are expecting it to be as funny as Super Troopers...then I would at least rent it first before buying it. It does have it's funny moments though...like playing a live action Pac-Man maze game..lol. And like a true slasher flick, it does have a good ammount of boobage. True fans of Broken Lizard will like this movie, but hope that their third installment is better.I miss Favre!"
2,Brittny not hot enough to make this worth sitting through...,"Not funny, not scary, really not worth the money or the time. I watched this for Brittny, who I feel wasn't exploited enough...I'll keep it because it was free, but if I watch it again, it will definitely be with the sound off. I never saw Super Troopers, but I'll tell you this-the commercials for that movie made me laugh more than I did during this entire film...is it necessary to be high while watching this? Plain ol' dumb s**t, period. Freddy Vs Jason was funnier than this, if you want blood and giggles..."
2,Plenty to look at but little to see.,"I came away from watching it one time with a feeling that there were lots of pretty women to see, a pretty good ending but a lot of wasted time at the start of the movie.With only two characters I cared about only slightly and a story that I never really could get into; I can only assume that I missed the point of the movie. That said this is probably not a movie for everyone.Other people said you may have to watch it more than once to enjoy the movie and this may be the case, but it will be a while before I watch this movie again.My review is from the regular release DVD, but from what I have read would also apply to the unrated release."
2,Not that good,"after seeing ""super troopers"" and the comedic skills displayed by the broken lizard writers and this acting group, i expected far more of ""club dread"" than was delivered. The few jokes that there were are simply spread too thin and are not nearly as clever as they could have been, and even the story simply lacks staying power. do yourself a favor, find something else to laugh at, you'll be wasting your time with this one. hopefully they'll do better next time."
2,this is a let down from The Broken Lizard crew,"Super Troopers did a lot for me and it wasn't a classic but it was funny as hell. Zoom foward to Club Dread which in the complete end of it has stirred away from it's own pot. Broken Lizard gang brewed up a mix of flat jokes, gorey violence and some scantly revealing women. In conclusion if this is your cup of tea then go for it but it's a let down. Bill Paxton (Near Dark, the upcoming Thunderbirds) who plays Coconaut Pete is the only highlight in the movie. Brittney Daniel (tv's That 80's Show, Joe Dirt) plays Aerobics Amy has her moments. It's like a bad hangover. Also starring Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever)"
1,They're all dying of boredom...,"Not funny enough to be a solid comedy. Not scary enough to be worthy horror. The plot (or lack there of) is not interesting enough to watch for the story alone, frankly it's boring. I did laugh once when the pretzel was doin' the watermelon, or vice versa. I forgot who was the bottom. I was looking foward to a funny gore filled movie, I didn't get that. You won't either. No matter how drunk, or stoned you get. NOT RECOMMENDED!!"
3,Meh...,"You can't ever be too hard on spoofs, because they are written to be horrible mockeries of whatever genre they are slamming. That being said, 'Club Dread' is only a moderately entertaining movie.Horrible story line, bad accents, and tons of cheese fill this movie to the brim. Of course its all intentional, but I think that some measures could have been taken to make this a little better. For one, the killer's name is Machete Phil, and personally, I think at least Dr. Phil woud have been better. But the name aside, this spoof is pretty low on witty humor which could've been more abundant. There where only a couple of parts where I actually laughed aloud, and considering 'Super Troopers' was pretty good, I had expected to get a little more than a couple of laughs.This is overall a mildly entertaining spoof, but I'd suggest even the Scary Movies over this."
2,I Was Disappointed,"The first time I saw Super Troopers, I came into the showing late. I actually fell out of my chair laughing at the bear costume scene. The second time I caught the movie at the beginning. I was in stitches laughing when they took the stoners into custody, and damned if I didn't fall out of my chair for the bear costume scene again!Club Dread was nowhere near as funny. It was a decent movie, but I was expecting much more."
3,?,"I saw Club Dread on opening night and I was a little disappointed with it. Super Troopers is one of my favorite movies, so I expected Club Dread to be equally or even better. Don't get my wrong, it was hilarious, but I just wasn't impressed with the plot. I do plan on buying the DVD to add to my collected."
2,Elena Lyons is compared to?,Elena Lyons is like a tomboy and looks like a supermodel in real life. She's like a Jiffy Lube Mechanic in a supermodels body. Elena Lyons has the greatest resemblance of American Pie and Confessions of an American Bride Shannon Elizabeth.
1,Terrible,"I loved Super Troopers, but this movie was a bomb. It's something you watch when it's really late at night, insomnia has set in, and there's nothing else to watch. I wouldn't watch this movie again, even if I was paid."
3,could have been great,"I bought this for my new Dell M65 because my old backpack was too small. The laptop fits well and the backpack offers superior protection. I also like the simple business-like all black styling. However, the straps are not as padded or comfortable as my old backpack. Also, the strap adjustment buckles slip, so I had to tie a big knot underneath to keep them in place. I travel on business a lot and need something that will stay comfortable and secure on a long haul, so I will keep looking for that. For trips to and from the office this backpack is fine."
4,"Useful, but includes errors","There aren't many inexpensive, easy-to-use sources for actual reading levels and interest levels for elementary school grade titles. So I found this book very useful while compiling a holdings list for high/low books in our library, BUT... In the Alphabetical Listing of Authors, there are errors such as listing the 309 page Young Adult novel ""Fallen Angels"" as being on the second grade reading level. In another section, it's listed correctely as Grade 9 reading level. After finding a couple of mistakes like this, I felt the need to double-check everything, which was rather annoying. The book is definitely still useful even with these flaws, but I thought a warning to other readers might be useful."
3,No written Instructions,"I like the under cab light it works wonderfully. However, there weren't any instructions on how to put it under the cabinet and all of the nails wasn't there. When I tried writing American Fluor about it, they ignored me -- so I will not be purchasing anything from them again. I had to pay my janitor to put it underneath my cabinet and to buy nails for it."
3,Okay,"I read it for the cultural aspects, so I wasn't expecting a great story. And it wasn't a great story."
1,A big disappointment.,"I'm a huge Statler Brothers fan and I have every recording the ever did. I bought this looking forward to what I'd hear, but I was very disappointed with some of their songs. A lot of their songs were not the traditional Statler Brothers style. Although songs like Put It On the Card and Fallin' In Love were great, the rest of the album was quite disappointing."
3,A biography that won the Newbery Medal.,"A short biography of Daniel Boone (1734-1820) written by James Daughtery for children, probably for ages 10-14. It won the 1940 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. This was a good biography when it first appeared, but better ones have been published since 1939."
3,"Not Their Best LP, But It's Worth A Listen.","When this album came out in '78, the Players were on their way out. Still, this album wasn't as bad as some people make it out to be. In fact, I think it was much better than the 'Mr. Mean' album that preceded it. Some of the songs on this LP, like 'Sleepwalkin', 'Nott Enuff', and 'Time Slips Away', are as good as the stuff on the 'Fire' and 'Honey' albums. 'Funk-O-Nots' was an attempt to be spacey like Parliament, and it doesn't quite work. It's danceable, though. The title cut was....okay. It was kinda like the stuff on the 'Mr. Mean' LP. 'Dance (If U Wanta)' was downright dumb. Overall, this wasn't a bad album. It was better than the preceding album ('Mr. Mean'), and waaaay better than the following mess ('Everybody Up')."
5,Awesome book!,"Within the first few pages, I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. I would have to rate this book in my top 10. I definitely will be reading it a few more times."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"THIS BOOK WAS SO AWFUL, I GAVE IT TO THE GOODWILL WITHOUT EVEN FINISHING IT.IT KEPT SAYING THAT IT IS REALLY HARD TO STAY ABROAD FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR CULTURE. (NO KIDDING) SOMETHING THAT WE DO THAT OTHER CULTURES DON'T ,COULD MAKE US SEEM RUDE OR IN EXTREME CASES EVEN GET US KILLED. IT GOES ON TO TELL TALES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT. AND THAT'S IT. THEY NEVER GO INTO ANY OF THE OTHER CULTURES TO TELL US WHAT IS AND IS NOT PROPER EDIQUETTE. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE BOOK WAS GOING TO GO OVER ALOT OF OTHER CULTURES AND TALK ABOUT THEIR WAYS.THIS BOOK DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING THAT ANY HALF WAY INTELLIGENT PERSON DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW. NOT WORTH BUYING."
5,Very Cute Read,I bought this book for my granddaugter's 3rd birthday. It is beautifully illustrated and a fun book to read. I saw the author and illustrator on a local tv station and they made the case for an interesting book. I highly recommend it!!
5,Fancy Nancy,Both my 4 year old daughter and my rough-n-tough 6 year old son love these books. It increases their vocabulary and captures their attention.
4,Fancy and Fun,"For Little Girls, this is a great book and this set with the Feather Boa for them to wear is a real extra."
5,An Excellent Start to the Series,"I think what makes us love Fancy Nancy, is not her fanciness (although to my daughter that's definitely a plus), it's how much she loves and cares about her family and those around her. This book illustrates how much the family loves Nancy back and it's really wonderful. My daughter loves the whole series and I could read it over and over again."
5,Accessorize,"Fancy NancyBy Jane O'connorIllustrated by Robin Preiss GlasserFancy Nancy loves to be fancy, but her family is very plain. Nancy gets an idea. She will teach her family to be fancy. They all dress up in fancy clothes and go out to eat at a restaurant. Everyone turns to look at them as they enter. ""Maybe they think we are movie stars,"" thought Nancy.Nancy uses fancy words like: fuchsia, plume, stupendous, and accessories.Any little girl who likes to play dress-up will enjoy Fancy Nancy.Jill Ammon VanderwoodAuthor: Through the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)"
5,Cute & Fancy,A great kid's book full of cute and colorful illustrations depicting a fun and whimsical young lady sure to please the younguns out there. Good way to get the kids to start reading at an early age. Books are awesome!
5,Book,Fancy NancyExcellent book. My students loved everything about it. The story is enriched with wonderful language and illustrations. Perfect for my second grade ESL students!
5,Nancy is the It-Girl for the Under-Six Set,"Fancy Nancy is a young girl who thinks more is more and is somewhat stuck in a family of plain folks. This picture book tells a simple, sweet story, but the illustrations and personality of Nancy are what lift the book to the status of children's classic.Girls who love tutus, jewelry, tiaras, feathers, boas, sparkles, pink and purple, butterflies, glitter -- in other words, most little girls we know -- identify with Nancy as she minces through life trying to make things more gorgeous. And yet, the story never becomes superficial and shallow. The fancy stuff is fun, and we love Nancy, but her family's love, plain and strong, is the backbone of the book.Highly recommended."
2,What a shock,I sure was disappointed in this one. What a big disappointment it was. I wanted my money back on this one.
5,Great!,I ordered this book for my daughter for Christmas. It came in on time and I can't wait to see her open it on Christamas morning. She's been wanting this book and will be very excited to recieve it.
5,Very Fancy Indeed!,"I bought this for my own ""Fancy Nancy"" and she loves it - as do we (the khaki pant/white t-shirt clad parents that we are!)! It's a wonderful story of accepting who we are and accepting those that we love for who they are NO MATTER WHAT. Loved the illustrations too! It's a Must Read for any little girl and her parents."
5,Fancy Nancy,"I gave this a 5 rating because I haven't heard any bad feedback. I bought this book for a little girl that I've never met. I met her mother through a transaction on Craig's List and found her to be a very nice, single mother who had just moved to a new area and was trying to find a way to get some presents for her little girl's upcoming 6th birthday. I decided to send this book and a couple of others just to help out."
2,Creepy Cover,The pictures inside and the story may be uber-cute but doesn't anyone find the cover picture a little bit JonBenet Ramsey creepy? It's basically what makes me reluctant to give this to any little girl.
1,Unhappy again,Second book purchased from this seller. Also disappointed with this one. There was writing on the inside of this book. Wish I had known that before I purchased it. This was not specified in the product description.
5,We love being fancy!,The age recommended says 4-8 but my 2 year old little girl loves it. This book is requested nearly every night at bedtime. My daughter also loves the glittery cover. We love Nancy and being fancy! Pink hair mousse not included!
5,Fancy Nancy,"Sweet, sweet story of a ""fancy"" little girls and their family's acceptance of her. This book is great for young girls, teenagers as well as adults. One for the princess in all of us!"
5,What a Fun Way to Grow a Child's Vocabulary,"I originally bought this book because my sister's name is Nancy. I read it to a class of pre-K children. They delighted in Nancy's ""fancy"" words for everyday things and the wonderfully exotic and sparkling pictures in the book.This book can definitely enhance a child's vocabulary while helping them relate to a little girl who is different than the rest of her family. I found that the young girls seemed to like the book better than the young boys.Luckily, my sister Nancy is becoming a grandmother for the first time and will have a grand-daughter she can share her Fancy Nancy books with!"
5,Absolutely adorable book for little girls,This is a girly-girl book for your little princess. Nancy is fancy and much to her chagrin must instruct her family in how to be fancy.
5,Absolutely beautiful illustrations,"Robin Preiss Glasser has tapped into everything that five year old girls adore. Every picture is effusive with details. One need not even read the story to love this book. My daughter took it everywhere with her for days; she made up her own stories. This is book is art, every frame worthy of being hung on a wall."
5,Fancy Nancy,"My granddaughter absolutely loves this book. She is 4 and could ""read"" it back to me after only a few times listening. Her new favorite word is stupendous and we always put fancy toothpicks in our sandwiches and eat with our pinky's raised and call each other darling. It's so much fun and we can hardly wait for the sequel in March."
4,A birthday present...,"I bought this book on a recommendation for a librarian friend, for a ""fancy"" niece's 4th birthday. I did read it, and loved it, I just hope my niece loves it as much as my daughter & I did when we sat down with it. Terribly cute, and a great lesson for all."
5,Fancy Nancy,This book is fabulous!!! It's the newest equivalent to Eloise. The illustrations are justsuperb and kids LOVE it. I read it at a school and the children were laughing outloud. It's great to just have fun with a book..no heavy agenda..just fun! I just purchased4 books to give on Valentines Day! What a great read!
3,Okay wish it was longer!,I really wish this had been a longer book. What was there was good and well written but the book itself was very short for the price that was charged.
4,another fancy nancy book to love,bought this one along with the bonjour butterfly for my 5 year old granddaughter....can't find anything not to praise....definitely recommended for little girls....
5,great children's book,"An absolutely delightful book!! My students loved it! Since my name is Nancy, I even dressed fancy!! It was a fun and heartwarming book!!!"
3,Girls like being dazzled,I bought this book because my best friend's name is Nancy. My three year daughter is discovering the frilly side of being a girl and loves to read this book over and over and talk about the pictures. She has even been inspired to dress fancy and dress me fancy. Little girls will relate to this story even though there isn't a deep message. Sometimes a light hearted frilly story is what a girl needs.
1,Terrible message--why teach kids to be pretentious?,"I would give it zero stars if possible....My friend's mother-in-law got it for her new baby. The title character, Nancy, is pretentious and obnoxious. She thinks here family is not fancy enough because they dress conservatively. She thinks everything sounds fancier when said in French and needs to be over the top.Why would you encourage children to act like that? It's bad enough there are so many grown-up prima donnas out there. I know this is just a kids' book and I probably shouldn't take it so seriously. I would never expose a child to this kind of thinking."
1,Do you really want your child to think like Fancy Nancy?,"How will this book make children who don't have fancy things at home feel? I think materialism is a vice that doesn't need to be taught in a children's book. Enough people learn this on their own, why try to instill it in a 3 year old? If you want a book about a cute silly girly-girl, buy Madeline."
1,why did I get this again?,This doesn't do anything at all. I don't notice any change in the quality of the items in my refrigerator.
5,Great gift,Bought it again and again for my Mom and she loves it everytime !! A perfect gift for the special women around you....
4,Very good,I always loved Perry Ellis... but whit this fragance i love more.... great scent.... perfec to gift...me entanca este perfume... es muy suave y delicado... buen regalo para mi suegra....
1,a big disappointment,"On the back of this DVD set it said ""some of the most memorable episodes in Bonanza's stellar 14-season run."" It turned out to be all episodes from the early years (1960 and 1961) with tinny garbled audio and marginal picture quality. The theme song is not even the familiar one but an earlier tune. This DVD set did not live up to its description."
1,Opportunity wasted,"This woman may or may not be James Dean's out of wedlock daughter. If so, I absolutely feel for the anguish she must feel at being alone without her mother, famous birth father, and step father. But this book gave me a headache. It was a blown opportunity to tell an interesting story, and kind of wafts along on what sounds like a drug addled haze. its incoherent story telling at best, berift of any sort of structure, with too much meaningless gingerbread thrown in for drama's sake.Save your money and don't bother, Sorry Di, you're a pretty lady and I'm sure have interesting stories to tell - its just that this wasn't it."
4,About 3 1/2,"This is a nicely made film with fine actors and a decent story. Overall though it is just okay. They really waited much too long to make a sequel. It was also just more of the same, except adding an annoying kid. I would compare it to the Mummy films. The first was great, then the second was a good movie, but it lacked the spark of originality the first had. It also had the annoying kid. Overall, this is a decent film to watch on a rainy day. It is a bit long(over 2 hours), but it was enjoyable enough."
4,Nice story,"We used this video in the children's Sunday School class. The children liked it, but thought it was a bit repetitive."
3,"Good, But Way Up In the Ivory Tower","This is a good book to read if you are thinking about going into business as a software design methodology consultant. But it may not be so good if you want to know the 'what' and 'why' of agile processes.Much of the book is very abstract, which the author acknowledges in his introduction, and very 'touchy-feely'. I view several of its insights as cliches--""Software development is a cooperative game of invention and communication"", and ""programming teams are ecosystems"" come to mind. I question whether these concepts are as groundbreaking as the author believes. Most managers learn them these days in basic training.This book is basically about about how process methodologies are constructed. If you want to formalize or document your existing process, or modify a formal process in a very rigorous way, then this is a very useful book. But if you simply want to understand what agile processes are all about, this book will probably disappoint you."
1,"Don't buy this one, buy the 2nd Edition","Buy the second edition of this book, called ""Agile Software Development: The Cooperative Game (2nd Edition) (Agile Software Development Series)""Agile Software Development: The Cooperative Game (2nd Edition) (Agile Software Development Series)This edition is way out of date and the new book includes the lion's share of this version plus a whole bunch more.Don't make the mistake I did. :-)"
4,Is it Agile or Anti methodology?,"The book makes me more confident in my varied approaches to project management. Cockburn does a terrific job of blending experience, anecdotal evidence, cited references, interviews, figures, analogies, and humor. He casts light on methods I didn't know much about (XP, Crystal, design by doing). The author presents a convincing argument of picking the right methodology for the job, and explains why methodologies are not 'one size fits all'."
1,"Brutal, boring, redundant, stay away","Agile Software Development is one of the few software books that I would return. It is full of abstract fluff (which is repeated in several different ways). This reminds me of an academic textbook. Just take a simple concept and invent some terminology to wrap around it in several different ways.I can't stand the author's writing style. Better make the coffee strong or this one will put you to sleep.Get an XP book or one of Steve McConnell's books on software design and methodologies instead, this one stinks...."
2,Not nearly as interesting as Daily Afflictions,"His other book, 'Daily Afflictions' is awesome and I've read it three times. This book is not as witty, detailed, engaging or sophisticated. I disappointment- it's just some pithy phrases on one page after the next."
3,too easy,"This book was too dumbed down and gave inaccurate definitions of the basics. I would not recommend it. I agree that the book's humor was offensive and got in the way. If updated, just deliver the material in a cohesive manner. Serious undergrads and graduate students dont need to be entertained so much."
3,Sounds Not Magnificent,"I've been collecting Karayan DVD's and I have all Beethoven Symphony DVD's of his. Finally I've got sick of all the same patterns of Video productions, so I tried Previn DVD's. At first, it was refreshing with detailed explanations about composer's life and the music by Andre Previn and with different setting (studio, not concert hall). However, I was really disappointed with the sound which was so poor that I thought the music was from cassette tape. And the volume is only one third of Karayan's which has superb audio quality as compared with Previn's. I don't know how they made this DVDs, but if they want to appeal to music lovers, they should do something special to improve the audio quiality. Well, if you want to learn music and composer's life, Previn's DVD would be a good bet, but if you just interested in listening to music with good sound quality, Previn's DVD would be a poor choice. What is music DVD for anyway?"
3,Too much Previn,I purchased the VHS version of this. I enjoyed the music but the commentary by Previn was much too long and should have come at the end of the performance and not at the beginning. I enjoy watching the musicians play their instruments but most of the time we may see an instrument but we don't see who is playing. We do get to see many shots of Previn though. We even see the camera placed in the orchestra that is photographing him. This was done in a recording studio and not in front of an audience. I intend to buy more of Tchaikovsky's work but in concert instead.
3,Board,"Ths boogie boards are ok, I wish I could have purchased one like the oringinal one with handles. Even if it cost more money, it was better quality."
2,Good while they lasted.,I purchased these with the double lane slip & slide for my grandson's birthday. The kids had a blast with them but they aren't very durable. One only lasted for a day and the other 3 for about 3 days worth of use. I guess quality isn't an option anymore.
1,To bad they do not sell the original one,Had to keep blowing the things up held air for a short time not as good as the ones that i had
3,Haven't used it,"This was purchased after the season for next year so I haven't used the product. However, I still received Amazon's usual great service =- so no complaints"
2,Boggie boards,"The product canme in a timely manner, but our summer is over and we have not been able to use it."
3,Decent Glove,"This glove is decent at best. I'm a UPS driver and had very high expectations of this glove. First off, it's advertised as having good grip. The grip is very average. I was expecting a lot more grip than it actually has. I've only used it a couple of times and already the material on the bottom is starting to wear. I would not recommend this glove if your gonna be handling packages daily or even using this glove daily. If your only gonna use it once in a while I would recommend and that's the only way I can see this glove lasting more than 1 month."
3,Need to be better quality,"while I did not buy the most expensive pair they make, I expected them to last a little longer. They were given as a Christmas gift and already have a hole in 2 fingers."
3,"Eh, they just dont take abuse...","For the price you pay, you would think these gloves would last a lifetime, but even as a hobbyist mechanic, I wind up going through these gloves after just a few months. 3 days in to owning these, and they already have a hole in them, they just dont make them like they used to. They arent even all that great on dexterity, the fast fit gloves are much tighter fitting all around and actually more durable."
1,One Star for the 5 Minutes of One Star,"Having met Morgan Fairchild many years ago, I have always been fascinated by her presence in movies and television. Had not known of this movie until finding it on Amazon Instant. Same your time on this foreign mess. To list Morgan as a featured 'star' of this one is a serious misrepresentation. If you take a break and do not pause you will miss Morgan. Don't pause at all and let this bad flick finish on its own....without you."
4,"Not their best, but still good.","It will be so difficult for this band to live up to their classic ""Bringing Down the Horse."" It is a shame though that people try to keep comparing their CDs to the aforementioned classic. In and of itself, this is a good album with a couple of catchy tracks, specifically ""When You're On Top,"" ""Everybody Out of the Water,"" and ""How Good It Can Get."" This is not their best, but still a good album. Definitely worth the buy."
3,kinda disappointed,"Me, being one of the world's biggest Wallflowers fans, I never thought a Wallie album would disappoint me. I was slightly disappointed when I got Red Letter Days. I'm a Bringing Down the Horse devotee... I love their catchy, distinguishable rock and deep, inspired lyrics, but when RLD came around, they had vanished. I listened to the cd with huge expectations from a band I felt so highly of, and was faced with track after track of derivative pop. Of course there are some highlights.... Everybody Out Of the Water, Feels Like Summer, Everything I Need, Empire Of My Mind. I never would have thought that a bonus track would end up being the best song on the cd... go figure. Anyways, this album isn't THAT bad, I just didn't expect it. If I had heard it first, it would've have been iffy on my purchase of it... I'm so sad to say that about the Wallflowers."
1,Wrong product,Red Letter DaysI received a version of the album which did not have the song list shown on the web site. I returned it several days (maybe weeks) ago and have not yet received the right album.
5,2 Stars???,How could anybody give this album two stars??? I personally think this cd is better then any of the past ones. You can listen to every track on the disk and then start it over and do it again. I love this cd.
4,MUCH better than I expected...,"At first I just bought this album because I got tickets to their concert on the 15th and expected it to be ok but it was much better...When You're On Top- OK song, sounds a little like Tom Petty... 3/5How Good It Can Get- Nice song but kinda boring. 4/5Closer to You- This might be my favorite song on the album! 5/5Everbody Out of the Water- Great song! Probably the hardest sounding track on the album. 5/5Three Ways- I usually skip this one. 2/5Too Late to Quit- I haven't quite made up my mind on this song... 3/5If You Never Got Sick- I don't fancy this one. 2/5Heatlth and Happiness- Boring song. 2.5/5See You When I Get There- OK song. 3/5Feels Like Summer Again- Good but not great song. 3/5Everything I Need- Hard to Describe 3.5/5Here in Pleasentville- Love this mellow-ish song... 4/5I hope this review was helpful. ..."
1,Pretty bad.,"I have to say this is the worst cd I've ever owned. There is maybe one song I did not laugh at and skip over, because the rest are horrid. I haven't bought a wallflowers cd since bringing down the horse, so I did not know what to expect, but this is sad. If you love the wallflowers, nothing will stop you from buying it, but if you've wondered where they've been since their days on the radio, forget about them and walk away before it's too late. Don't let your last memory of them be about how bad they are, but about how great they were."
2,Big Dissapointment!!!,"What is with all these high reviews??? This cd is terrible! The first few songs are cheezy pop songs. Why did the band decide to go this route... Breach is their best album. So diverse, so strong. However it was not very successful at all on the charts. That's probably why they are going back to this cheasy bubble gum pop rock on red letter days. If you want to hear cheezy pop songs, this record may be for you. If you want a solid wallflowers disc, go with breach!"
1,Terrible!!,For the same price many other reels are much better than this one. In a month its drag was all gone. Backlash is normal no matter how experienced you are...I will not buy Okuma again
1,Lavish Presentation of Mediocre Pictures,"This is a huge coffeetable book with heavy paper and the whole high-quality works. However, the photos contained within are, well, kind of lame. The theme of the book, as the title DRIVE BY SHOOTING suggests, is photos taken in transit, in vehicles or from the windows of cars and trains. While that idea has potential, the views chosen are uninteresting in the extreme--stretches of highway, industrial areas, yellow-looking people on subway trains. Many of them look like the sort of tourist shots-out-the-window that you struggle to explain years later when looking through a photo album--what was I trying to take a photo of? The photographer traveled all over the world from India to London to South Africa and beyond to assemble this collection. It seems like a waste of time to me."
4,Good Bargain,"Unlike other re-chargeable spotlights,it holds a charge. The lantern is good, and the flashlight option is great."
2,Good for the price... I guess.,"The ""spotlight"" is bright, and shines a good distance, but it's also a bit underwhelming. I was expecting something with a little more power."
1,my first totally disappointing product purchased from amazon.,"yes, the item arrived on time and in what seemed to be in great condition. i followed all instructions especially about charging the unit and guess what, the first time all three lights worked fine. 5 mins later, only 2 lights worked as no spot light came on. i charged again and still nothing. the next day with a full charge and only 1 light was working, the other has a long delay before it comes on.i live in the caribbean so it makes no sense financially to return this item. it's a terrible item i purchased and will not recommend this type of unit to anyone!!"
1,Wagan Brite-Nite Spotlight,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.... 1st one received would not charge..... amazon replaced the item immediately but problems again w/the 2nd.... charged as per instructions & small light & camp style light were good but main spotlight barely illuminated..... decided to let it rest & try second charge; well the spotlight didn't evem light after sitting 2 hours (no 2nd charge attempted)..... while amazon has been very good about working w/me i'm just not gonna send this back, 2 outta 2 in 4 days is just more then i want expecially when i live out in the boonies & services ain't around the corner....."
3,Good features but my bulb burned out.,"Had a problem with the bulb wiring on this one. Was fooling around with it aimlessly a couple hours, and then bulb burned out unexpectedly. Bulb is standard tungsten-lightbulb, which is a disappointment.Comes with an AC adapter, which good for car use."
2,"Pretty, but too shallow...","There's some good things about this book: in typical Lonely Planet style you've got great general travel information for the area (which if I really wanted, I'd buy a general travel book).It does also cover a large number of sites - though is still far from comprehensive.And it has some nice additional information occasionally through the book.Two main peeves though. And they're killers:- Each description is a paragraph, or two at most. You can't tell me very much about a dive site in so few words.- There are no maps / diagrams for specific dive sites (just area overview maps) - a dive guide fails totally without these.It's a pretty book, but to be any use you need to include maps and more detail per site (if this was done it could be forgiven for not being totally comprehensive).In short, it's nice, but it's no use as a tool for researching a dive holiday.What'S further is I now own two of these (Red Sea and Bahamas) - I certainly will not buy another."
2,and where might I find these dive sites?,"Agree with the ""pretty but shallow"" assessment below. On a recent trip to the Abacos, found it completely useless without map coordinates. There must be a market out there for dive guides without maps or GPS coordinates (people who don't actually want to dive? the clairvoyant?) but..."
2,Sigh,"I liked all the Talent series, although I found Lyon's Pride a little slow in places. But this one stopped. Dead. Okay, I'm exaggerating, there were definately a few interesting moments, but it was just so slow. I found myself skipping such large bits it was difficult to follow the plot. And the Rowan hated beetles, where did this sudden liking spring from? I doubt I'll reread it."
1,McCaffrey's Worst Ever,"This book is a disgrace. Too many characters to keep track of easily, stupid and contrived situations, irrational plot, insipid dialog--this is a travesty of what McCaffrey has offered her fans (and I'm one) in the past. I can't believe this tired and totally worthless trash is hers. She should be ashamed of herself."
4,Not bad but should have been deeper - better developed.,"I'm hooked on the series so I couldn't wait to have the book. But, it was too fluffy, just like a news letter, catching up on what everyone was up to but no deep development of the characters or further ""revelations"" dealing with the alien creatures. I'd prefer a smaller meatier book focusing on two or three main characters with a ""fluffy"" cast around them."
3,"A nice book, but no real excitement","I avidly had read the first four books in the Talents series (The Rowen, Damia, Damia's Children, Lyon's Pride), however, I was kind of disappointed in the empty feeling about the end. It gave you no real conclusion, and I felt that there could have been so much more. The only real thing that kept me reading was the hopes that the book would get better. Don't get me wrong, the plot is good, and there are a few twists in the story, but nothing huge. I do recommend this book if you've read the first four, but don't expect too much."
4,Good read but left too many loose ends,"I've loved the Rowan series but if this is the last of the series then I'm unhappy. Not because it is ending but because there were too many issues not resolved. Unlike real life, we only have the writer's words to continue knowing what is going on. I enjoy all of Ms. McCaffeys' books but this one left me feeling unfullfilled. Hopefully she will read comments and give us another 'Rowan' book with fewer mistakes (as with Afra being Damia's brother) and more resolutions not just a dangling ending"
4,Slightly better effort this time,"The Rowan books are my absolute favorite McCaffrey books (with the Freedom Landing books a close second), but I've been really disappointed by the last three books in the series. The Rowan and Damia were incredibly good books, but to be honest, I wish they had left off all the beatle stuff with Damia and explored other plot lines. However, The Tower and the Hive was better than Damia's Children or Lyon's Pride. Laria is a very sympathetic character, although I found her romance to be completely unbelievable. I found myself skimming most of the ""beatle parts"" - again, I really wish McCaffrey would have found another plot line to explore. There are a ton of loose ends in this book (the biggest one that jumped out at me was the ""romance"" portion, although there were others). She also didn't really provide a credible way to resolve the FT&T problems."
3,I love McCaffrey but this one was a little lacking.,"There had to be an end to the Rowan series. I only wish the end of the series was a little deeper and memorable. The best thing about this book was Laria and Kincaid's relationship. It was just not developed enough. I will not tell anyone not to read this book but I will say that you need to prepare yourself for a not so easy read. I did not waste my money, but Anne McCaffrey has a lot better books out there. She is still my favorite though!"
2,Disappointment,"I have long believed that McCaffrey can do no wrong but ""The Tower and The Hive"" just didn't do it for me. Admittedly, there were some wonderful moments but nothing to compare to ""The Rowan"" or even ""Damia's Children."" Maybe she lost something by having many main characters instead of one as in ""Damia"", it didn't show in ""Lyon's Pride."" I honestly wish that I never read this book -that I had left that universe to my own imagination because I got no sense of closure for the end of this series. I came away without any satisfaction. Don't bother reading this unless you really like Zara since this is the first time you really get to see her. Read ""To Ride Pegasus"" or ""Pegasus In Flight,"" earlier books set in the same universe."
3,The book is good but not as great as the rest of the series,"The story is great, but the fifth novel in this series does not have the same dynamic storyline as the other four novels. The story is a fun read, but the author does not emphasis on any dominant characters like in previous novels."
3,Disapointing Finale,"Like other peole, I was disapointed with this, the last of the FT&T books. While it did a fine job of character development with many of the people, it left too many loose ends for me. The main problem with the book, in fact, was that it was too much character development, and not enough action. What it needs is either another 100 or so pages to clean up loose ends, or perhaps another book to really finish the series."
2,The book that went nowhere fast,"I hate to say it, but this book did very little for me. I've been an Anne McCaffrey fan for years, but this book is a disappointing ending to a great series. I was surprised to find out that the plot went absolutely nowhere. There was some intrigue and political maneuverings, which I've enjoyed in many of McCaffrey's novels (Sassinak, Decision at Doona, Crysal Singer series just to name a few) but I was surprised when many of these plot twists and turns ended up as dead ends.Perhaps, McCaffrey has become so enamoured with these characters, she couldn't bear to part with them. I'm not sure. To me, this seems like she was trying to just tie off loose ends with no real story behind the works."
3,She can do better,"I really enjoy most books written by this author and have read quite a few. Having said that, the ending for this series was blah and disappointing almost like someone else had written it."
1,Not worth it,"I didn't realize that there was a 5th and concluding book to the Tower and the Hive series, and I consider it a waste of money, because there was nothing really in this book that was must-read material. The story may as well have ended with Lyon's Pride (which was probably the worst book out of the first 4). Anne McCaffery _could_ and _did_ write better.Ms. McCaffery introduces a few antagonists, but they aren't enough of a menace to make you feel worried that the protagonists may actually have a real fight on their hands. The conclusion is as anti-climactic as can be, when the Human/Dini alliance (ok, fine, pretty much the Gwyn/Raven/Lyon clan on their own) finds a simple way to address the main problem, and then the story just ends."
5,Tower and the Hive,"Buying the book was an adventure, I was looking for another book in this series, and this book was shipped on time and arrived in the condition described, This was a totally satisfactory transaction."
4,The Tower and the Hive (Rowan),"I was very glad to get the one book that I had not yet read, it was a anther exciting episode in the series. I enjoy reading this book"
4,Still worth a read.,"I am an Anne McCaffrey fan and have all her books and although this won't be in my list of top ten books; it is still a good read. It does continue the story begun by Rowan and it does tie up some loose ends. Personally, I thought the pheromone solution was quite ingenious!"
1,A dissapointing book with a predictable ending.,"I usually enjoy most of Anne McCaffrey's books, but not this one! There were too many characters to get involved in the plot personally. The way to solve both the Dini breeding problem and the Hiver problems just wasn't--original. I hate to spoil this for you, but come one--pheremones that they just happen to stumble upon! She's written better."
2,"Rushed, disappointing end to the saga...","The Rowan/Damia series, has to date been wonderful. But not here! In an ending I describe as ""throw the material from two books into one and finish it up"" this book looks VERY rushed, pushed and uncomfortable with itself. What a shame to end the series on such a note. People and events are refered to out of context to such an extent that you reread earlier parts of the book to make sure the pages aren't missing."
3,Mediocre for McCaffrey,"If you've read the previous books, then the first quarter gets very repetitive, continually recapping on the past story, as already explained in the preface!The characters are mainly as in Lyon's Pride - and the few new ones are not well developed. The plotting against FT&T doesn't come to much. And who does ""The Nose"" think he is? - claiming the credit for the pheremone solution - though that solution seemed pretty weak!Basically it would be nice if AnneMcCaffrey would rewrite completely! There could have been some good plots and twists, much better than actually occured.However, all said and done, McCaffrey is still a good read."
1,Disappointing - not a page turner,"My wife eagerly wanted me to read this concluding novel of the Talents series, yet it left me feeling empty. It had been a few years since I've read the other novels, so the storyline had faded from memory. Unfortunately, the novel did not draw me back into these characters. By bringing everyone back and wrapping things up - everyone felt like minor characters. There was no tension and no buildup, and no reward for me. It felt like having a postscipt extended into a full length novel."
3,Continuing character development,The focus is on continuing development of characters introduced in the previous books of this series. There is really only one new character. It won't make much sense if you have not read at least the previous two books and preferably all four. Some inconsistencies have crept in despite the stated efforts to keep them out. Don't look for much in the way of action or suspense; the heroes and heroines are just so powerful that it is sort of like reading a bible.
3,Disappointed in final book,"Unlike most Anne McCaffrey fans, I actually prefer this series to the Pern books. Including ""To Ride Pegasus"" and ""Pegasus in Flight"". This final book disappointed me.First, there was that horrible monologue at the beginning. This is a series and should be read that way. There is no reason to have one of the main characters rattle on about everything that's happened previously.And while I don't mind a book with a few loose ends, this one is supposed to be the last in the series. The entire ending was a loose end. There was no sense of fulfillment, no climax, to the book.The middle was the best part of the book."
2,Not a terribly good read,"I've read Anne Mccaffrey books since I was 14 & loved them all, but The Tower & the Hive left me so disappointed. Wishy-washy characters, weak storylines, and more questions than answers does not make a good final book in the series. The story also didn't flow for me & seemed unfocused. What on earth were the publishers thinking letting this book go to print? A pre-teen new to her work may get some enjoyment from this book, but not those who have read McCaffrey's other books and know how well she truly can write."
2,Plot is not up to McCaffrey's normal standards,"Though ""The Tower & the Hive"" has the same feel as her earlier novels, this book does not have the plot development of those books.I would not have bought this hardback."
1,"Dull, underdeveloped aand unfinished","I have read all the others in this series, and all the dragon books multiple times, I doubt I will reread this one. It had lots of potential, the disfunctional talents, the tensions on home worlds, the unease about the Lyon clan, tensions between human and mridini all of which could have gone somewhere and didn't.There is certainly potential for another book- but I hope its not as dull as this one"
5,Great Western!!,"This is a great western about two bounty hunters one blinded and the other crippled from a man who doublecrossed them which they are seeking their revenge.Starring Robert Lansing and Slim Pickens,it's a must see movie!!"
5,An interesting premise.,"I've been looking to buy this movie for decades. A long time ago I saw this movie and thought it was a unique idea for a western: two bounty hunters, one with a lame shooting hand, one blinded , combine to become one: one with the eyes to see, the other with the hand to shoot. Together they go after the outlaw that wounded them both. Now, this is not the best movie ever, but it is a neat little tale. There's a simple plot, the beautiful scenery of the Alabama Hills of the eastern Sierras and a solid cast that includes John Wayne's son, Patrick, in his first major role and Robert Lansing, a very underrated actor. If you like westerns I would recommend that you check out ""An Eye for an Eye""."
2,difficult,"I was disappointed when I saw it, it is very difficult for me because I am a beginner , not printed. Really it's poor puss."
5,I Can Do It!,"This is an exciting day for Ollie; it is his first trip to the store all by himself. He listens to his mother as she reminds him of all the do's and don'ts and then he is on his way.However, mom didn't warn him about the witch, the aliens, or the monster that he encountered on the way; but Ollie can take care of himself as you will see in this fun tale of imagination for children.Very cute book with great colorful illustrations."
4,Final Fantasy Origins,"It was nice having I and II on one disk, you don't have to get up and change disks all the time. Some people don't care for FFII, but I thought it was just as good as the first. The music gets annoying after awhile (puts me to sleep when my husband is playing), but otherwise great game play. Unfortunetly, the didn't put the added missions on the Playstation version like they did on some other game consoles. It was also hard to find cheats online, not many people seem to be sharing their info.I would recommend it to any role playing game fanatic."
4,"Great game, broken cd case but otherwise worked fine.","The game worked great and, for a very old game, it was extremely fun. Unfortunately, the cd case for the game was broken when I received it. That was disappointing but I am not too upset about it."
5,This is the game that got me hooked on RPG,This is the game that got me hooked on RPG video games. Decades later it's still one of the best games ever. Jody Bissoon
4,"2 for one, clasic, but good","Fun classic 2D games. They aren't very complicated. Level up and save the world! there's even a little bit of story to them. Anywho, they are classic fun games, remastered to look a little less pixelated than their original release."
3,Fun for all the original Final Fantasy fans,Fun for all the original Final Fantasy fans. I played the original when I was a kid and now the remake has improved upon the original while still sticking to the original story plan. If you enjoyed th eoriginal as much as did you will love this with its remade video sequences and enhanced playability.
4,One good game out of two..,"The remake of Final Fantasy 1 is done very well, with new sound and graphics, and other extras, but the remake of FF2 wasn't so good. I had never previously played FF2 and after playing it here I realized I hadn't missed much at all. But the remake of FF1 is worth the whole package...plus you get an extra game to try out. Recommended for people who liked the original NES RPGs or anyone looking to try the original FF."
4,Great Improved Port,"The improvements made t the original 2 are made aparent to the players of the first releases. Graphics, Music, and gameplay have been tweaked to make it more accessable without making it too easy on the player. It was the first rerelease so there ins't universal saving. It's good to know that you can mash the attacks without missing an enemy because there's nothing there."
5,Awesome,"I love the original Final Fantasies and collections of old games, so this is the perfect purchase, and cheap too!"
5,FUN GAME,ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS GAME IS THE BEAT IT MIGHT BE HARD AT FIRST BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT IT'S SO FUN!!!!
1,Not so good,"Back in the day games were difficult and these are no exception. Without some sort of guide to walk you through it, you could spend hours racking your head against the wall because the game is so vague about things that you don't know where to go or what to do. Not the best story, either."
2,didnt like it,"maybe im just crazy, but i didnt like this game very much. i thought it was boring and tedious. but thats just me."
2,Primative Games,"Final Fantasy I & Final Fantasy II are nothing special to me. They are very primative, made in 2D. Final Fantasy II is a lot better in it's origanal form on ""Super Nintendo"". Also the story lines are different in those two versions. It,s for little kids."
3,Electrfying (Ha ha ha!),"This book is not as funny as I expected it to be, althought the story lines aren't that bad. The drawings are pretty spiffy but overall I must say I'm enjoying the second editon (volumes 5-8) a lot more and just over half way through it. Overall and okay read, especially worth persisting through for the second book but fairly far fetched."
4,Good,"I bought this CD based on previews. A lot of the songs start out good but they drag. The best part of the album are all the guitars, especially on Dark Alliance. A lot of the songs sound the same, but it is still listenable.Dark Alliance is my favorite track though, because of the amazing into.Overall I recommend this cd, but it has its flaws. Still worth the $$ spent."
2,"Could be a lot better, good if you can get it to work.","Took a long time to get it working properly, but eventually I got it working on Windows 7 64-bit. It's nice to be able to listen to FM radio while on my computer :)The product comes with a 6 inch USB extender (Male to Female) so if your ports are close together you can still use the tuner. The antenna (which is retractable) when fully extended is about 4 feet long.Works similar to a car radio, hold the number of the station you want to save as a preset until the number shows up next to the signal quality display."
3,Software doesnt work on win 7,The software bundled with this does not work on Windows 7. I did some google searches and turns out snapfish works. Installed and everything works great.
2,Problems connecting,Purchased this product for the RDS capability. The product does work but I have a hard time connecting the software to it when I start my computer up. I haven't figured out the sequence of plugging it in and starting the software for a successful connection. Also the Snaptune software is no longer supported.
1,Failure to launch,"In the age of digital media etc, I decided to get a digital fm tuner since my girl likes listening to a certain radio station and we have a good set of speakers on the computer which serves as our media center.The price was good and the reviews about average so I decided to try my luck ... and I came out with the short end of the stick.This thing is useless. It comes with cd that has the interface for the tuner and the interface does not work.It shows that you get internet connection, but when you tune in the frequency of the station you want, it resets to 292.1It has another interface that can be used, but that interface has been taken offline since 2010 ... we are in 2013, why is this still being sold?So there you have it folks. Stay away from this."
1,Doesn't work.,"The CDROM that it came with only included software for Windows XP, you have to download the Windows 7 software. Unfortunately, even though I am near several high powered radio stations, I am unable to receive ANYTHING with this tuner. A complete waste of money."
1,very bad product...,"this product its a very bad product, i regret i bought it , it usely it doesnt work , it get a very bad antenne, usely there is no signal ,i get an old cellphone with fm radio this phone it a excellence fm radio but the ads rdx-155 ef instant fm music it s the worst thing you can buy on amazone.. bad , bad ... i don t recommande this product !"
3,Low quality software,"The hardware itself seems fairly decent, though the short USB extension cable did not fit real tightly. The software that came with the device though is a mess. Snaptunes has apparently gone out of business, the domain name is up for sale. The Instant FM app is small, and not resizable, so the buttons are hard to read on some screens. In addition, it's buggy, it refuses to remember any of the settings that are changed or station presets on my XP laptop, which makes it rather worthless. I checked the ADS support forum, no updates are available and the knowledge base does not mention the problem."
2,Instant FM - Not,This product doesn't work like a charm. The reception is only as good as the antenna picks up the station. It's not as good as the description leads you to believe.
5,Works well in W7 with bundled software,"Many here say the included software doesn't work with Windows 7. Yes it does. You need to enable the radio. Plug in the radio and let W7 find and install the drivers, then go to Start > Control Panel (Category view) > Hardware and Sound > Manage Audio Devices > Recording tab. If the radio doesn't show up, right click anywhere in the window, wait a while and make sure ""Show Disabled Devices"" is checked. Right click on the radio and select ""Properties"". At the top, name it ""USB FM Radio"" (without the quotes). At the bottom, set ""Device Usage"" to ""Use this device (enabled)"". Click ""OK"" at the bottom, close Control Panel, click on the radio software icon, and enjoy."
3,Poor reception,"It was bought to be used as FM receiver at my Carpc. The reception is ok if you plug the antenna and use the gadget in your house, however at the car, it does not work generating a lot of noise."
1,It only picked up static.,The software installed without problems... but the item picks up only static. It never tuned into any radio stations. Even when used within less than a mile from a radio station.
4,Astro Zombies,"Astro Zombies is first rate shlock.So bad it's good.Complete with faded stars, cult stars and inane dialogue. A must for fans of bad B movies."
2,Tin-toy robots and Tura Satana... how can U go wrong?!,"If yer looking for 'The English Patient' keep right on walkin'... but if you want Tura Satana at her best (not! - that would be ""Faster, Pussycat!) and windup tin robots for special FX then this IS your movie!"
1,Makes 'Plan 9' seem like 'Citizen Kane.',"Makes 'Plan 9' seem like 'Citizen Kane.' Beyond awful. I like a goofy, crappy movie as much as the next guy but this is just too much. Clearly viewed by John Waters as a child. As an extra bonus, it's written by Trapper John."
2,true shlock but the print is bad.,"this is one of those thrown together microbudget flicks of the 60's. I like it but it's not the best put together movie you'll ever see for sure. The print needs cleaning up though, too many scratches and such. But this has to be seen to be believed. I would give it three stars on the shlockometer if not for the print. Sure it's a bad movie, with clunky dialog, cheap sets , bad direction, wierd little robots in the titles section that have nothing to do with the movie, but this is interesting shlock and it does have the late great tura satana and john carridine in this flick. It's so wierd though that most people would just turn it off. Which is a shame, because this is so bizaare with the zombies coming on and wierd electronic music blaring as they kill. Wendall corey is in this one too and the fine actor looks does his best with the awkward lines. Still this is alot of fun in a bad good way and they just don't make movies like this anymore. Fix the print!"
1,The best movie ever created by Humans,"When I saw this glorious display of fine filmmaking, it was like seeing the face of GOD and having Him smile back at me, saying ""You are my most beloved creation"". Prophecies filled my head since the moment i saw those overly detailed, high dollar astro zombies take the stage for the very first time. It marks the birth of a new generation of wild, free-spiritedness. This classic film has uplifted me to levels of un-paralleled wisdom and solitude. While watching the lush cinematography, I feel as if I am going to become an omnipotent beam of light, and live throughout every time and space in the whole universe at once. Bravo! John Carradine, Bravo!"
1,Astro-crap Zombies!,"I thought I had seen the worst movie ever when I saw Coffin Joe - At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul (hey that rhymes), but I changed my mind after slogging through this piece of crap. Completely and utterly unwatchable, horrific acting and no plot make this incoherent piece of junk too bad to enjoy even for B movie nostalgia. Where was MST3K on this one - I guess they didn't want to bother with it either!"
2,King of the B's,"One of Ted V, Mikels' less interesting or entertaining films about scientists trying to make perfect people. What they end up with is evil half human/half robot monsters. The Astro Zombies go on a rampage, but get killed off and there's not much more to say."
3,"If You See John Carradine, Go Fix A Snack...","""Astro Zombies has two major flaws. #1- Not nearly enough of Tura Satana! Of course, I could watch a 3 hour movie of her just standing around smoking cigarettes!! #2- Way, WAY too much meaningless babbling from John Carradine (as the astro-scientist)! Listening to him explain everything to his henchman ""Franchot"" is like watching your mother-in-law knit! His scenes (which take up like a third or more of the movie) are excruciatingly painful to both mind and body! They drag on and on until inducing a coma-like state. A limbo between suicide and hysteria. The rest of the flick is cool enough, with it's solar powered zombies, spies, thugs, cops, murder & mayhem, etc. Ted V. Mikels ain't no Hitchcock, but he just might be hitch's neighbor's brother's gardener. Enjoy..."
4,Excellent Reefer Substitute,"If you are considering to abstain from marijuana use (and you should), I recommend this movie to assist in any possible withdrawals that might insue. Plotless, disorienting and ineptly filmed, viewing this thing will give you the sensation of being hopelessly stoned.So buy this movie and JUST SAY NO!"
4,"""Joe"" is a hit with primary students","I too am a school librarian (well, actually, a substitute school librarian). ""Don't Laugh, Joe!"" has been a favorite of primary students at the three schools where I work. The text is fun, the illustrations are appealing, and the kids enjoy acting out scenes, such as when Joe is sniffed, poked and shaken. Joe is a possum who, with the help of a sort of ferocious bear, learns the art of playing dead. The bear learns the joy of laughter. ""Don't Laugh, Joe!"" lends itself well to a discussion of animals and their defenses."
5,The best book on Muscle Testing,"As a certifed personal trainer and pilates instructor, I work primarily with individuals who are challenged with back pain and various joint problems. This book provides a clear and concise protocol and information for working with individuals with muscle imbalances. You definitely need a strong background in this area to understand and use the material appropriately. The DVD is also an excellet companion to the book."
5,The Holy Grail,As a Physical Therapist this book is the Holy Grail reference for my practice. Outstanding for both instruction and reference.
3,Not the same as individually wrapped wipes.,"I ordered this from [...]. And then I found out it doesn't contain the same ingredients as the Purell gel or individually wrapped Purell hand sanitizing wipes. I was looking for the same product that contains 62% of Ethyl Alcohol. Instead, this product has Benzethonium Chloride 0.1% as active ingredient - same active ingredient as the Wet Ones. (Wet Ones contains 0.3% of Benzethonium Chloride). I'm returning this product and reordering the individually wrapped Purell wipes, they are much more pricey though."
3,purell wipes in a can,"sounded like a great idea, and they do work, but they are not the same as the single packed wipes. There is certainly a of the purell fluid, but the texture is very scratchy and wet. I was expecting a more babywipe texture, softer. Glad I only bought the one tub."
3,Decent quality,"Bought some for the house, works well for small areas. or small items. Good for hands sometimes as well. Okay enough for daily use."
4,Great Resource for Feeding Your Baby,"This book is very informative. It is a bit dry to read, but it is known as the breastfeeding ""bible"" for a reason. It helped a ton of my friends learn to breastfeed well and to breastfeed longer."
3,"Take some stuff, leave the rest","I read this book before my first was born. The techniques for latching on, identifying problems, breast care, and other basics of breastfeeding were well described and very clear. However, be prepared for specific philosophies on parenting to be preached to you. Also, I would have liked more than a chapter included on the father's role in breastfeeding.It was a helpful book, but went a little further into the La Leche League values than I would have liked."
1,Did not receive whole book!,"When I received this book, the first page started at page 51! It seems that nothing was done to the book (regarding pages being torn out) since the bind was still in tact... probably just a defective book. But it would have been nice for them to check the book before sending it out."
1,Not the info I was looking for,"I really couldn't believe the thickness of this book when it arrived - how could there be so much to say on the topic of breastfeeding?!? A lot of over-the-top, over-protective mothering advice. A lot of plugs for joining La Leche League. Not a lot of practical advice for breastfeeding that I was interested in. More emotional support for those that choose to breastfeed their three-year-olds, and a thick layer of guilt for those that ""choose"" to return to work. (I'm sorry, I look at it as ""choosing"" to not let my house go into foreclosure!) Modern moms - pass this book up in favor of a book with more realistic, practical advice, and skip this book on baby-wearing, co-sleeping, and being a ""breastfeeding couple"" with your child until the the child weans himself!"
1,Judgmental LLL Propaganda,"There are several really excellent breastfeeding books on the market that have a positive, practical and sensitive approach to all types of mothering and feeding practices. This is not one of them. This is a 400 page advertisement for La Leche League and the message that I received from this book is that good mothers breastfeed and give birth naturally and everyone else just didn't try hard enough. It is subtle, but once I noticed it, I could not avoid the glaring fact that this book is laced with masked criticism and veiled judgment. Wouldn't it be great if, in the collective group we refer to as mothers, we could all stop looking down on each other and promote acceptance instead? If you feel the same way that I do, you will not buy this book."
2,"Service was great, book was a let down.",I was not impressed with this book at all. That being said. The sales transaction was quick and easy.
3,Don't be fooled,"There is a lot of helpful information about breastfeeding in this book. But, basically, this book is an Attachment Parenting book disguised as a book about breastfeeding.And the condescending tone throughout this book just disgusts me. Just look at the title. Even the title is holier than thou. I guess women who are unable to breastfeed just aren't womanly enough.If you're looking for a how-to guide to breastfeeding, this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for a how-to guide to Attachment Parenting, then this is the book for you."
3,All about breastfeeding - just not sure this is the best book for newbies,"I am a huge fan of breastfeeding - to the point of being annoying about it probably. I got this book before I had my little one and read it front to back. Once the babe was born we had a lot of problems the first month with breastfeeding (latch, soreness) so I read it again and again. I have to say, it really wasn't much help. After we got our problems worked out, I happened upon the Dr. Sears Breastfeeding book and found that one to be much better! So great in fact that I buy it for all new moms as a shower gift. I wish I had had it before I had my tot.So, I say skip this and get the Dr. Sears book. And yay for breastfeeding! :)"
5,Must have,"The best book for breastfeeding moms. You can trust the information, it is always well backed by professionals and research. Answers just about any question a nursing mother may have. La Leche League is the authority on this subject."
2,Outdated and sexist,"Couldn't stand this book. I'm all for breastfeeding and promoting it when a woman wants to, or is having trouble. This book doesn't really seem to have been updated since it's initial publication. Felt very preachy.I have found much better, more modern resources on breast feedind and while La Leche League touts their support to new mothers, I made three phone calls to reps in my area and never received a return call.If you are still interested in the book, check it out from the Library in your area. Or email me, I'll send you mine."
1,disinformation,I was sorely disappointing in reading just the first chapter. Information relayed in the book as to epidural effects on breastfeeding was used as a scare tactic as was the pushing natural delivery.I was most disappointed because this is a group that comes highly recommended and yet presents opinions as facts that are in direct contrast to the Mayo Clinic.It was a waste of $13.
3,A good reference book,"I have this book and treat it as a quick reference guide when I have situations arise and need a quick answer.. but this book is not a good book for a first-time breastfeeder who just needs support. The book is really cut and dry about what needs to be done and is also a little too far fetched. It states to do things that are not realistic such as.. when having a latch problem, to latch the baby on and off 30 times at each feeding until it's right. I see the point, but also feel that with a baby so tiny, once he is on and eating, you don't want to keep removing him! It makes you feel guilty for choosing to supplement formula if you need to relieve painfully cracked and sore nipples! If you are looking for a reference guide, this book is good to have on your bookshelf.. which is why I gave it 3 stars. But if you are looking for an uplifting breastfeeding book that explains thngs more reasonably.. then I would recommend Dr. William Sears.. the Breastfeeding Book."
5,Great book,Arrived with great timing. In excellent condition. This book goes far beyond its great information on breast feeding. There were many other informative topics.
2,Breastfeeding help or Attachment Parenting?,"If breastfeeding is all you're looking for, don't buy this book. The information given was no more helpful to me than a small pamphlet that I had received from WIC. And the exact same information was repeated 4 or 5 times throughout the book, with no added tips or pointers. Maybe you can skim one or two chapters (the ones that are actually about breastfeeding)at the bookstore to learn all you can, but you won't need the whole thing.If, however, you want a lesson on attachment parenting... go for it. You'll get all you want."
3,"Helpful, but hard to use...","This book does have answers to help you breastfeed your babies, but I found it to be somewhat cumbersome and hard to read. I felt that I really had to search to find answers that I was looking for, and when I was engorged right after I had my baby, I looked to this book, but found no relief.Don't get me wrong, it is a good resource, with lots of information for moms. I think if you had major problems breastfeeding, beyond the basic latch problems, this book would really help. But over all I'd recommend Janet Tamaro's ""So That's What They're For!"" for most new moms. It was far more light-hearted, and had more easily accessible information."
2,Too judgemental and pushy,"I really do not like this book. I am all for breastfeeding but in this book they really talk down to you and act like you are terrible if for some reason you choose not to or can't breastfeed. Also they don't give you a whole lot of helpful advice on how to do it, they try but The Nursing Mother's Companion and Spilled Milk are two books that you should buy instead of this one."
1,Better resources available elsewhere,"I found this book poorly organized and written. At the time I purchased it, I was already planning to breastfeed, and while I found I agreed with most of the substantive material in the book, I couldn't stand its preachy, condescending and dogmatic style. Nearly every chapter contains the same repetitive arguments for why breastfeeding is wonderful, and downplays the very real difficulties that some mothers experience with breastfeeding. The book is short on practical tips, and finding information on a specific topic is difficult due to poor chapter and index organization."
2,Annoying,"This book annoyed me to no end. I am a thinking, practical woman and with all the troubles we had (mastitis, yeast, oversupply, work, food allergy), I needed some guidance, not stupid anecdotes about other people who had that problem and still breastfed.This book is not informative and is not a guide for breastfeeding. If you want instructions, not stories, get the nursing mother's companion book. It actually tells you how to handle situations rather than how other people were in that situation and were so glad they kept breastfeeding through it."
3,The Wonanly Art of Breastfeeding,"I haven't gotten very far into the book yet but so far it seems to spend an awful lot of time explaining why I should breast feed. I think if you're going to read the book in the first place you've probably already made that decision. But like I said, I've barely skimmed the surface."
5,SAVED MY SANITY DURING BREASTFEEDING,The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding saved my sanity while breastfeeding my two children and my daughter's while she was nursing. I'm sure it will do the same for anyone else who reads it and treats it as a 'breastfeeding bible'.
2,No help increasing milk supply,"Yes, I agree with all the comments about this book being very smug about non-breast feeding or formula-supplamenting mothers. My problem with this book was the very clear indication on the back cover that there was information on how to increase milk supply. The was absolutely NO such information ANYWHERE in this book, and I read it cover to cover. The closest thing I found were a few reassuring comments that as long as your baby is gaining weight, and your diet is good, you should be fine. As a working mom who is pumping daily I have recently noticed a decline in my milk, and while their reassurance is very nice, what I need is ACTUAL practical advice. This book was seriously irritating."
4,Helpful for first time Moms,"This book is pretty big and a lot to read for anyone, especially a new Mom who has her hands full with a newborn. I would recommend reading it while still pregnant to find out about what to expect when you begin nursing, and simple solutions to common problems BEFORE you experience them. After baby is born, this book is useful as a reference or support guide from day one through toddlerhood. It discusses the mother-child bond, nutrition and proper diet for baby from her first foods to the terrible twos. I've used this book more as a reference from time to time, turning to the chapter that most fits my need. The stories other Moms share are relatible and supportive. This is a wonderful book for Dads too because it helps men to understand the sacred, unspoken bond a mother shares with her nursing baby."
5,Extremely Helpful and Informative Book!,"I used this book for guidance on nursing my two children, and had success with both! It answered all my questions and made me feel even more sure that my decision to breastfeed was a good and natural choice."
4,Great information,"Although I had breastfed my first child, I felt I needed a refresher with my second. This book provided a lot of valuable information and debunked several myths I had. It also has information on the various positions, which I felt helpful."
2,Gave Me False Hope,"I read this book through during pregnancy (first child) and flipped through it again when I started having nursing problems. It set me up for failure because of the fact that they say ""breastfeeding should be painless"" (which is not entirely true) and because they paint a beautiful picture of breastfeeding (but it is quite ugly for many moms). They make is sound so natural and simple but in many cases it is horrendous. I had a DISASTER of a nursing experience despite having read this book and it wasn't because of any medical issues. Even when we were able to nurse pain-free, it was still quite unpleasant and inconvenient (this was a big disappointment because of what I read in the book). The book is written by women who had wonderful breastfeeding experiences and can't really offer any help or consolation to those who struggle or plainly dislike it. It does not paint a realistic picture about breastfeeding and will NOT prepare you to nurse your first child!"
5,Recommended for your home reference,"This is an amazing resource for anyone who is pregnant or has just had a baby. It is very affirming to the role of mother (and some bits about fathers in there, too). It answers all the tough questions about breastfeeding, gives examples, advice, encouragement. Several chapters in the back are devoted to specific difficulties and conditions. It is a great book. I highly recommend it!"
1,"If you like to be judged, read on","I hated this book.When I tried to nurse my first child, who had multiple health issues at birth, I felt like a failure. Needless to say, this book compounded that feeling and made me feel like I should have a big ""L"" tattooed on my forehead. I recommend ""So That's What They're For"" by Janet Tamara. She makes you laugh, all the while giving you invaluable tips for every ""nursing"" roadblock you could run into. LaLeche League needs to get over their snooty selves and realize that there really is no ideal breastfeeding woman. We all have our own way of doing things and that's what makes the world go 'round."
3,So So Book,"I didn't really like this book. I bought it being told it was the BEST book on BF out there and now I am thinking I was misinformed. The books chapters bounce back and forth from one thing to another, its very hard to follow. There isn't enough real info....just letters from other women with their experiences, it feels too much like What to Expect When Expecting (a book I didn't like as well) If you want an educational informed read, get a different book. If you don't mind a spread out all over the place mess, go ahead and buy this."
5,What an experience,I found a 1969 copy of the book at a garage sale and am I glad I bought it. It was one of the funniest things I've read; it reminds me of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And the friends of mine who have read it agree.
5,EXCELLENT-A MUST READ,"I read this book many years ago, and I absolutely loved it! I would like to have another copy of it again, and will try to get it through amazon.com! It is the kind of book that you will refer to for the rest of your life, ""the glass pig theory"", for instance! It is a one of a kind classic, and one that I ""highly"" recommend for one and all!"
4,Grass is a Gas!,"This book is funny, satirical, and informative. The authors cover all aspects of this worthy plant, giving some history, some recipes, and some real insight into the minds of consumers. I recommend it highly. (Pun intended.)Published in the late 60's, it is now out of print, and the quality of copies varies hugely from book to book. Take extreme care when planning to purchase, and don't pay more than $20, unless it is pristine."
5,A hysterically funny book! A must-read.,"It is a shame that this book is languishing out of print, because it is without doubt one of the funniest books I have ever read. It's also savvy, informative, and just plain fun, for the cannabis afficionado or non-participant alike. If you enjoy laughing, keep an eye out for this book! If you're a publisher or agent, please consider bringing it out again!"
5,A hilarious book that is recomended for non users as well.,A hilarious book that is recomended for non users as well.
1,Don't waste your time.,"A 547 word article that is only a portion of the full article. Go directly to Liability Consultants rather than pay $5.95 for an incomplete, and relatively useless article."
5,Jean Vigo: master of masters!,"L' Atalante (1934), name of the mythical Goddess, specialist in getting away of men, means for Truffaut, one of his ten preferred ones. Its unlucky story has known multiple obstacles, beginning with the death of Jean Vigo, once the footage was over, the changes made by its producers as well as the successive restorations, being the last one in 1990, that carved in relief a violent film, tormented, fevered, filled of ideas and fantasy, featured by an exacerbated romanticism, almost devilish but profoundly human.Very few films have been able to depict with such poetry and conviction, the quotidian details, images hovered by an enraptured lyricism, in that hard to achieve dimension in which the real and the imaginary are blended with mesmerizing results.Extraordinary and majestic film."
4,"""Great Film"" seems dated","We seem compelled to make lists. As we aproach the end of the century, it's hard to open a newspaper or magazine without finding out who were the top 10 supermodels of the '90s or the top 10 chicken soup recipes of all time. So of course, the question of the best films of all time keeps popping up, and most critics agree; this is one of those films. It was released in Paris in '34 just days before its 29 year old director died. Moviegoers were still excited by pictures with sound in them at this time, and the art of film making was evolving rapidly. As a result, good films released then earned their ""great"" status based on how deeply they influenced the future. The film remains a very good movie, but in the opinion of this reviewer it has been surpased in the 65 years since its release."
2,A boring movie!,"MY RATING- a dubious 5.0Yeah, you bet, all you french guys who think this is excellent! I found myself looking to the time in my videorecorder waiting ansiously till it finished! I know it may be naturalistic or surrealistic, yet my sincere cinematic opinion is that this is simply a bore!It's totally uncinematic, since it don't feel the mov going with a nice story to capt our attention. Just a young married couple going in a boat trip in the river and you can expect what's gonna happen- simply nothing happen! Like all french flicks!At least La Regle Du Jeu had some social critique involved.My rating is rather dubious cause of my doubts towards the quality of it. I might love this one someday when I learn more symbols or such things. In the meantime I don't have the right of give bad rating--or good rating!"
4,Letterbox is not Widescreen,This isn't so much a review of the film as a comment on the DVD presentation. The product description is `widescreen' with an aspect ratio of 1.66: 1. The film is actually presented in letterbox format so as to accommodate the picture within a 4:3 standard vision television set. Widescreen it is not.The back cover of the DVD slick also states that the DVD's regional code is `ALL'. This is not the case. Amazon's description that this is a Region One DVD is correct.Prospective buyers of DVD's deserve better than this from distributors. I don't blame Amazon; they can hardly be expected to view every DVD to ascertain that the technical information is as claimed by the distributor. We all rely on the integrity of those selling their products via Amazon. In this case we have been let down.
3,Funny and Dark,I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie but it was very good and the death scenes just kept getting more and more violent and creative
2,Buried humor,"The talented, lovely Rose Byrne's perfect American accent can be heard in his lackluster dark comedy with a flock of fine Canadian actors. The story is as moody as the Nova Scotia weather and, at times, even more gruesome. Sad to say, I never got caught up in the humor. But it's not awful -- and few things are as vitalizing as gazing at Rose."
2,E-X-P-E-N-S-I-V-E,"I don't mind paying $5.99 a jar when I can buy it for $5.69 in the local Albertson's, but freight at $23 plus change makes this product expensive! They could offset some of the freight charge (after all, it's jars) by lowering their price."
3,Should have figured....,"...that any bra that says it covers all three B,C, & D sizes would not really work for a B size woman. I can see how this bra would work for a D size woman but if you are a B or C it is too big to offer any real support while sleeping. I washed it a few times in hot and dryed it and it didn't shrink at all. Lesson learned. It was comfortable material and a nice design so I would recommend it for someone looking for a size D bra. B or C ladies should try something else."
2,"SMALLER, UNCOMFORTABLE FOR LARGER BUSTS","UNCOMFORTABLE FOR LARGER BUSTS, TIGHT AROUND CHEST, ORDER AT LEAST ONE SIZE UP. I NEVER USE THIS, I LIKE TARGETS' NURSING TANKS FOR SLEEPING IN."
2,don't like it,"I bought this bra because of the design - no need to fiddle with clips etc to nurse, but pretty soon after I got it, the fabric lost its elasticity, which means I lost all the support I needed. Even if you're only planning to wear it at night, it doesn't do well with multiple washes, and I found the side-opening cups annoying: the material kept slipping back and interfering with my son's nursing, causing him to pop off every now and again. I found I had to hold back the cup with my hand the whole time. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Confortable but sized strangely,"This bra is comfortable and perfect for sleeping, but the style is such that as you move in your sleep, you shift out of position in the garment. I expected the cups to be larger as this sized for a D or E but it seems at least one size smaller then that."
3,Well I guess it works,"To start off with, I am a size 40 D or DD, thus I think of myself as an extra large woman ( I'm also 6' 2"" ). So I'm pregnant and I bought this bra, because at my size I need a little something for support at night. On the plus side the itchy ( at this point everything makes me itch ) elastic is hidden away in a trench of cotton and it really does keep my skin happy. However on the minus side, being such a large woman, and this bra being quite low cut, when I lay down and roll over, something usually pops out, and that just throws the support thing out the window. Now I bought an XL which says it will fit a 40 - 42 D.E., and I fit in that size range, and while I'm sitting up it works just fine, but this is really a bra that l think is made for a smaller sized woman."
1,Horrible service,"It took forever to get the nursing bra (over 3wks later than stated) and when I did, it was the wrong size and wrong color!"
4,Perfect for House/Sleeping,All I had was high-impact sports bras and needed something that was not as restrictive for lounging and sleeping for my extremely sore breasts. This is exactly that. Soft and comfortable but it is not for major support. I don't like feeling all squished in to a sports bra while I am watching tv and sleeping. I ordered a L for 34DD and 36D.
2,fits really wierd!,I am not sure if I would recommend this product. The material REALLY RIDES deep into your armpits making it quite uncomfortable. The front is very accessible though. If you are bothered by tight fitting items on your arms/armpits don't buy this product.
2,Not true to size,The size was not true to what it said. I got the Large and its way to small. I went to a local store and bought a new sleep bra and its a 38C and fits perfect.
1,this bra sucks!!!!,"this bra is a waste of money. it offers no support and my breast fall out when i lay down. dont buy it, spend more and get more. i recommend the medena."
1,ill fitting bra. Order smaller than your normal size.,I bought this according to the sizing chart but apparently it's only built for football players. The elastic band around my ribs fit fine and was almost to maximum stretch yet the cups and shoulders were way too big. The cups extended past the elastic band so there was a lot of loose fabric under my arms and this left me unsupported in the middle. The straps were so far apart that they fit like cap sleeves and then fell down. Maybe this is cut differently in smaller sizes because the one I received did not fit like the picture.
2,Good info but unclear photos.,"The information on the dolls themselves is helpful BUT many of the the photos are very underexposed. Some of the dolls faces are impossible to see making their usefulness as a guide to identifying ""mystery dolls"" somewhat limited. I was lucky enough to see a copy of this book in a store before buying it on line and would recommend that it be ""checked out in real life"" before purchase."
4,0.85 cts Tanzanite Ring,"This ring is beautiful...on the ""delicate"" side but quite nice in color which to me is ""lilac."" It wasn't easy to find tanzanites set east-to-west so I am happy with my selection."
5,Got to Play the Blues,If you like the blues you will love this C.D.Mick Martin has a beautiful voice and plays a killer harmonica.Keep those C.D's comming Mick Martin.
1,Another ripoff remake.,"This is yet another horrible remake. It clearly says that is is on Vanilla OMP, whatever that is.I do not understand some of these reviews that say this is on Mercury.Label: Vanilla OMPASIN: B004IWQRM6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It also says:This product is manufactured on demand using CD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply.What is that all about?"
4,Sounds of History,"Other reviewers talk about lone hits for ARS so that must make me an anomaly. I never owned an ARS album growing up but I know and jam (in my head) to just about every song on this CD as most of them could be heard on radio stations through out the south back in the day. ARS has a jazzy feel that is still Southern Rock in its roots. Champagne Jam and Spooky are excellent songs but my favorite has always been ""I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight"". Long title, but excellent song. Their 'hit' is a good song too but they had depth that is worth going after. Their sound holds up even today."
4,Good Album,"This is a great compliation of their greatest hits. However, I was disappointed in that they left out one of the best ones: Back Up Against the Wall. I also wish they would release their live album ""Are You Ready"" on CD."
1,DON'T disregard the other reviews - these are covers!,"I'm not sure who's behind all of these fake ARS Best-Ofs but if you're looking for the original songs, don't buy this album. They sound close to the originals that we heard on the radio back in the '70s but they aren't the real thing. Look elsewhere!"
2,Skip this album,"I really like ARS so it pains me to see this album be released. I dislike it because it overlooks many of the really good songs on the other albums, such as 'Large Time' and 'Homesick', like so many other greatest hits collections. As another reviewer aptly noted, it was all about the songs with ARS and nearly everything they ever did was very good. So go buy all the records or CD's you can lay your hands on. I have nearly every one of them and love so many of the ""filler"" songs."
5,Some ARS Confusion,"It is obvious some fans have completely mistaken this set for a budget CD released in the mid-90's, one which displayed re-makes in favor of the originals. That set was done to side-step contractual troubles regarding rights to material, as ARS was trying to re-establish itself in the mid 90s. While the remakes are a curious listen, this 1991 Polydor collection does tremendous justice to a wonderful group. I can't top Kevin's great review seen in these pages, so this was mainly to clear up the misunderstanding about the bogus best-of. True, the new Millenium set has superior sound, but a very short track list. I would still spring for the 91 edition, as it is solid top to bottom...artwork included. :)"
3,Good Album but not the originals.,"This is a good album but I noticed that it sounded different, mainly the Bass playing was not the same. Paul Goddard is a really good player and this did not sound like him. I did some research and it seems like this was a re-recorded version and does not quite have the same fluid musicianship that the originals had...its goood but I prefer the original recordings."
3,Half of this disc is pure MOR adult contemporary garbage...,"I think ARS are very good when they are playing strong pop songs like ""So Into You"" or solid roots rock such as ""Doraville"", but half of this disc is pure MOR adult contemporary garbage."
1,Poor,"I love this band, but this album is not good. And the songs are rerecorded. They are not original."
3,Remastered,"These songs are remastered of the original tracks. Although they sound good and all, they are missing something. It seems that most of the ARS Greatesy Hits (CD's Mp3's and so on) are all remastered. If you want to hear the originals buy the 20th Century Masters Collection. The songs sound like they did back in the day."
4,They're Good!,"I had ordered these along with the Churchill Slasher Bodyboard Fins Medium/Large, and they both were excellent. These, although, were a little heavier and provided less impulse than the Churchill Slasher Bodyboard Fins. Also, with these, it takes more time to enter 'the wave' than the other ones, simply because they are just a bit heavier. Other than that, these came good through the mail, and in less time then I had hoped!"
2,What a letdown!,"I love Jack Kirby. Even the wacky 70s Marvel stuff that most people hate - Eternals, 2001, Captain America. I also love the Black Panther. As written by Priest, he's one of my favorite Marvel characters. I never had read any of Kirby's 70s BP run until this collection came out. I'm wishing I still hadn't encountered this. I was ready (and expecting) a ton of weirdness and nonsensical stuff going on but I really wasn't prepared for how badly plotted and written this stuff is. To me, this is absolutely the worst Kirby-written product I've read. Knowing the potential of the character makes these awful stories even worse. The art is great 70s Krazy Kirby but it really doesn't make up for the bad stories."
4,Pleasently suprised! A nice addition to my collection,"If you enjoy the sounds of Maxwell, you will dig this kid. Smooth and sultry vocals with nice production... Pure neo-soul. I'd been looking for something new to satisfy my starving ears until the ""Black Summer's Night"" comes out and THIS hit the spot. Much love!I don't know where this kid is from, but I know I'll be keepin' an eye out for more from Michaux."
5,"Durable, Realistic, and Kid-Friendly","Excellent toy. It is durable. It is realistic in its small details (and accurate to history). It is perfectly sized and colorful, making it very easy for a child to enter into his/her imaginative world of play."
5,Fabulous Album!,"Richie Sambora is tragically under-appreciated in the music industry. If you don't believe me, listen to this album you'll wonder why he isn't a household name. I bought it when it first came out and still listen to it. His vocals are beyond compare. I think his voice is his best instrument and that's saying alot since he is an amazing guitar player. You cannot go wrong with this CD."
5,"Bring It On, Richie","An amazing debut album! Since buying this masterpiece I've never looked back! It is packed with fantastic songs ranging from the bluesy title track to the rockin' Rosie (co-written with Mr. Bon Jovi). Further collaborations with musicians such as Eric Clapton give this album depth and it is good to hear David Bryan and Tico Torres playing on the album. There are no bad songs on this album and 7 out of the 10 are fantastic, the two best songs being Ballad Of Youth and Father Time. Richie shows off talents that take a back seat in the band, such as his electric voice, and he really shows us what he can do with a guitar. Head and shoulders above Jon's solo efforts, I can't recommend this album enough, and I can't wait for the next one!!!"
5,Thumbs up!!,"Excellent album, way better than his second...the solos are amazing, the music is very well structured, the composition is superb...just buy it..."
5,Richie Sambora VS Bon Who???,"I am now purchasing this CD for the THIRD time. Everytime I have purchased a copy some Girlfriend walks away with it.ITS THAT HOT!!!Jon may have been the genius in the band, but there is no way to compare Richies talent to Jons. Sambora is an all arround pro. Not only is his guitar talent and his songwriting talent, but his vocals are so strong they can cut thru you so deep that you can feel it in your soul.If you like rock blues style it doesnt get any sexier and hearfelt than this.A MUST ADD TO YOUR COLLECTIONWords to describe this CD... SEXY, HOT, BLUES/ROCK, BON JON WHO???"
5,Great tunes and Awesome vocals,"I was introduced to this album by my brother. I soon bought my own copy. This album is in my opinion a clear departure from the ""Bon Jovi"" formula. What grabs you immediately is the vocals. Richie has an awesome range and power behind the mic. For being an album done by a guitarist, it's not really guitar oriented it's more a musical statement and the arrangements have a great deal of sophistication. I've played this album for other musician and non-musician friends of mine and they've all agreed that Richie has some great vocal chops. I had a hard time getting the cd back a few times. Least favorite songs were Rosie and River of Love. Favorites:The Answer, Father Time, Intro+ Church of Desire and Mr.Bluesman. This is a must have CD."
4,Impressive.,"I have always suspected Ritchie of being a fine musician, more than his work in Bon Jovi would allow one to guess,and this album was a welcome confirmation.Filled with very competent guitar work and lots of feeling-on top of that add his excellent voice,this is a total coup."
5,One of my favorites,"I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, from Rap to Opera, Country, to Heavy Metal, but when all is said and done, this CD has had more time in my cd player than any other in my collection. I highly recommend it. This one is definately in my top 10 all time favorite CD's."
5,Great album from Bon Jovi's guitarist,What a great album! Everyone who loves aor and melodic rock blues has to own this masterpiece. One light burning is one of the best rock ballad I have ever heard. I give it 9 out of 10.
5,Undiscovered Soul,This is the first time I purchased a Richie Samboracd and I loved his music. I fell in love with it thefirst time I heard it. I think I like his solo hitsmore than I like him with Bon Jovi. I like Bon Jovi.If it wasn't for Bon Jovi I would of never heardof Richie. My wedding song was by Richie. It is(ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS) Every time I hear thatsong I remember my wedding day.There isn't a bad song on that disc. If anyone everasks how that cd is I wouldn't have one bad word to say.
4,New Paltz,"I am a student at SUNY New Paltz, which is the setting of this book. I found this novel to be very interesting and humorous. It is amazing how much truth is in this book and how many similarities there are between the town of New Paltz he portarys and the reality of the actual town. I honestly would recomond this book to anyone who wants to read a funny book about a small town."
4,Work well with my LEDs,"I bought a pair of these that I mounted on the Arlington boxes that are specifically built for siding. The installation was a breeze except for the prewiring. Normally you would be appreciative of having most of the wiring done for you, just connect them to your electrical, however, the way it was done it made it difficult to insert the insulating ring. I have a pair of LED lights that put out a great deal of bright wight light. Both of these are set to the wide range and they turn on long before you get to them and then shut off at the time you designate. I would recommend these."
2,Poor sensor hinge design,I installed this on the side wall of my house. I set it up so that the sensor and the lights point to the left side.lights turn ok. but not the sensor. you can turn it only so much and the sensitivity is poor. maybe I did not pay enough for a light that could do what I needed.
5,Great light for a good price!,"I needed a light for my backyard that was motion sensored. It was very easy to install, and works perfectly! I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,Very unreliable brand .. returned all 6 in 2 weeks.,"I am not sure what this brand is about but I purchased 6 from local home depot and had to return all in 2 weeks as they failed .My neighbour purchased 4 and none worked after a week.Heath Zenith, Please get into some other business as you are bringing some cheap product in the market , which is very unreliable and cheap.After buying this product, I realized how bad some products can be,.."
4,Everything works as advertised except...,"The light sensor could be a little more sensitive, meaning it should detect mostly darkness before activating the light. At early dawn and dusk, it activates the light.The base of this unit should have a larger cavity to house all the wires. I have to cut a hole in the wall to house the wires."
2,"Good price, quick delivery. If only it worked.","Items arrived on time in good condition, the price was good, installation was easy, but setting the amount of time the light stays on does not work for me, and the sensor is inconsistent. I had it installed and tested the sensor about 5 times before i called my wife out to show her, at which point the sensor wouldn't turn the light on even when i was 4 feet away from it. She rolled her eyes and went back inside. The lights will stay on for 1 minute when i set the time to one minute, but if i set to 5 or10 minutes the lights turn off after 10 seconds. Returning and will spend more money for a better product."
4,Motion light,"It was easy to wire up, sensor worked just fine and it was easily positioned where I would like it. Upon getting it where you want the light to focus,just snug down the rings and it holds tight."
1,worked for couple weeks,it worked for couple weeks but now it goes off like every 8 seconds over and over not very good product and i think it blow a 2500 hour bulb in less than maybe 3 weeks if that
1,did not work,"I bought two lights. One worked and the other one did not. Well actually, it does work. Just not as advertised. It never goes off, day, night, motion or no motion. I sent the provider a emailn about it and have never received a response!"
5,Decent Lights,Arrived much quicker than expected. All parts were with the box. Very ewasy to install and adjusts to almost any angle you desire. Motion detection works perfectly as well. Great set of flood lights for lighting up a larger backyard area or anywhere you need extra lighting/security. Excellent product for the price I paid!!
4,GOOD LIGHT,THIS UNIT WAS WELL BUILT. METAL NOT PLASTIC. IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL AND ADJUST. VERY GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY.
1,Faulty design,"purchased two of these, both faulty for different reasons. One unit goes on,but not off; the other doesn't go on until you are almost under it. My advice-buy a different brand."
5,Decent quality great price,I have had the motion sensor light for a couple of months now and it has worked great. I have no complaints.
4,Great Wedding Ceremony Microphone,"The Shure WL 183 is an ""omnidirectional"" lavalier mic - perfect for putting on the Groom at a wedding ceremony to pick up BOTH he and the bride. You will have to E.Q. carefully and place your speakers properly to prevent feedback, but this mic has a full, rich sound."
5,It's a Shure. What else do you need to know?,"Another great product from Shure! Works amazingly well with its omni-directional pickup. Similar to a SM-58, right on your shirt."
1,Fair Warning,"Especially for this price, I expected this product to arrive in the famous white box with the individual cups and the map in the lid, NOT loose in a brown cardboard box with a scrap of white wax paper between the tape and the loose jelly beans. No ziplock bag, not even cheap clear plastic bag, just the brown cardboard box (the outside was white). Yes, the website says to read everything carefully. No, there is no picture of a Jelly Belly box. I just had my own expectations, and I wanted to give you my opinion.Good luck."
5,Yum!,"Can I get 48 flavors? Will someone take out the black jellybeans (licorice)?Other than that you cant go wrong with Jellybelly's! And this is an economical way to keep them around the office as a treat. I have to chase my co-workers off because they want to refill the cup if their favorite flavors are not present. Someone has to eat the brown and black ones, cmon!"
1,Buyer Beware,"After opening the box, I realized the box was half empty. I put the entire box + Jelly Beans on a scale to double check only to realize the entire package only weighs 6 lbs. Buyer Beware."
4,Valuable and interesting - as literary history,"This volume aims for a college audience in that provides extensive background to understand the social context of the poetry - something a scholar of the poetry would know - and it provides rather literal translations of the poems - rather than reworkings of the poems that work in English. As such, this is a book you read for what you can learn rather than for literary pleasure.Nonetheless, it is enjoyable reading for someone (like myself) with no particular interest in the region or the time nor interest in female literature solely for the gender of the author.The most surprising piece is a poem written by a woman to a woman. One of the more interesting to me, is a poem which straddles the troubador and religious traditions."
4,Trobairitz,"Using a gift card that I had forgotten about, this is one of my most favorite and recent purchases in poetry. As a testament to her writing skill, the historical essay is just as intriguing as the translated poems. I was a bit surprised at the sometimes blurry quality of the images and photos, but the text more than makes up for that. And although I do not speak 12th century Occitan, I am glad the poems were in Occitan AND English.This book might only appeal to a small minority, but I am very pleased with it for educational and enjoyment purposes."
1,Wow design flaw?,"these pants are my size but the dividing line between each pant hangs way too low.. its like baggy pants style accept this is the way it was made. I can even make a full step without ripping these apart .. the only reason i am not gonna bother with returning it is because of all the shipping and waiting and basically waisting my time. But i highly suggest not to buy these, unless you have unnaturally/unproportionally short legs!"
3,Meh,I've worn these pants one time. I bought them to wear over a pair of slacks to ward of the chill on the way to work. I bought them a size larger than my normal to fit over the slacks...yet they are a little tight even wearing them without pants underneath. They seem to be decent quality...but a little thin on the outer material. I would rate them higher if they fit was a little closer to normal pants sizes.
2,this book is hmm....okay i guess,its this simple it does have good facts and what not but it jumps from subject to a whole different theme! for example one paragraph is talking about the economic aspect of the guilded age and then it jumps to like the westward expansion...then it goes back back in the following paragraph into the guilded age however now its talking about librarys....to put it point blank...i like books that go in timeline format! and well this one doesnt! thanks!
5,... a MUST for all Catholic homes and churches!,"I work at a Catholic Church - and I am constantly referring to Robert and Virginia Broderick's book for answers to questions that often baffle me. Not once have I had to turn a visitor or caller away. This is one of the best Catholic encyclopiedias around - written with lay-people in mind. It is easy to understand, and, literally, warms the hearts of the readers. There are 150 pen-and-ink (liturgical) drawings by Virginia Broderick - one of the greatest Catholic artists alive today - illustrating many of the entries her late husband explains. The drawings alone are worth much more than you'll be paying for the encyclopedia. My suggestion is to buy more than one copy --- and pass the extra one around. It will surely edify and entertain anyone who loves the Catholic Church. Once I pick the book up,I find it VERY difficult to put it back down! I especially love studying Virginia's art. She's a contemporary genius! (Dan Paulos, artist)"
3,Catholic Encyclopedia,it was not what I thought about the bookBut I like it's just an ok bookI will reserve it to very young begginers of Bible students
3,Too much theory,"I found that this bood went too much into the theoretical aspects of neural networks and did not rigorously go into a concrete example to back up their models. They skipped many steps in their analysis when going through examples; it would be nice to see where exactly their numbers come from so one can replicate a neural network for financial modeling at home.Other than that, this book is quite solid. But without concrete, simplified examples, the less knowledgeable reader may not get much out of it."
4,Perfect for econ - fin modeling,This is one of best books to kick start your NN in econ and fin. Highly recommeded. It has tons of examples.
4,Good Book,Very interesting book. But it may little simple to reading.You should read this. I have to say that really good price
1,borrriiinngg,This game was probly the worst game iv ever played...the grafics sucked and so did every thing eles...it wasnt even realistic....THIS WAS THE WORST GAME ALL YEAR!!!!!!
4,Ok bike for the price,"By now you know this is one of the most inexpensive tandem bikes you will find. What you get, is an inexpensive bike on par with the cheap bikes you'd find at Walmart. What do I mean? It will work, but you won't be impressed. Examples: It has 21 gears, but I doubt you'll get the front shifter to go through that range. The wheel will be warped after your first ride, so you have to put up with some wobble and/or it will hit the brakes every time around.With all that said, I'm happy with the purchase. I take my kids on it and they like it. It's got big fat tires which is nice. (Although one of them developed a bulge so I had to deflate and reinflate to reseat the tire.) Again, all the parts are cheap so assume you'll have to replace and/or adjust settings along the way. May not be the best for people that have no idea how to tweak a bike."
3,Tandem,"Overall it's a good quality bike. My only complaint is with the assembly. The front tire didn't seem to fit with the fork and I had to modify the front brake assembly just to get the wheel to fit. Even then the front brake and fork still seem too small (not wide enough) for the size of the front tire. The rest of the bike is fine except I only wish the seats could be adjusted with a quick release mechanism that most bikes have these days. Using an allen wrench every time you want to adjust the seat is tedious. But for the price, I guess it's worth the trouble."
2,"Good, But.......",Bike came mostly assembled. Could not get the gears to shift. Took it to a bike shop and he said that the cable to the rear derailer was twisted inside the cable. It was replaced and it seems ok now.
4,"Not bad for $219, functional but a bit crude","Bought the bike with low expectations as every review seems to have some different aspect of an issue with bike, as does mine. My issue is that the front fork is bent, requiring the front wheel to sit at about a 10 degree angle from vertical and the front brakes being adjusted to be skewed with the wheel to avoid scraping the wheel all the time. Went out and put 20 miles on her, bike did fine. The kickstand was an unexpected feature and it works great. Met my expectations, I would not spend over $250 for one though."
5,great bike!,I wanted a tandem that would work with my disabled 10 year old. this one is perfect! i had it professionally assembled at a local bike shop and they commented on the quality. I would buy it again in a heart beat.
5,Love the Kent tandem bike,I ordered a Kent tandem bike online and it was delivered two days later. The bike was packed well in the box and there was no damage. A friend and I put the bike together in less than an hour and the fun began. We use the bike at the beach and now my wife and I can bike together in tandem. The bike is well built and the 21 speeds and brake system work well. I highly recommend this tandem bike.
4,Value for the Price,"I bought the Kent Dual Drive Tandem Comfort Bike on line after trolling the net for the best tandem available under $300...and there was nothing even close to this product. Altho I was a bit apprehensive not having seen and inspected this bike personally, I took the risk and was pleasantly surprised when I finally got the package and assembled it. True, this was manufactured in China and yes, the accessories were not exactly top of line....but given the price I paid (total of $299 including shipping costs), this was great value for the price!!!"
5,Excellent Tandem Bicycle,An excellent product. Received bicycle undamaged and on time. Packaged bymanufacturer to be easily assembled.I do recommendothers to purchase this productin the future.
1,Do not recommend this company,"We purchased the Kent Tandem Bike from Amazon.com, the bike came with a seriously bent rear wheel. We were not able to use the bike at all. After leaving several phone messages and e-mails (they never did answer my e-mails or return my phone calls) I finally contacted Kent. I was told I had to pay for the shipping of the bent wheel to them, then they would replace it after they received the bent one, and I had to pay for shipping the new one to me. I was not happy with this reply and was told by the company it was an Amazon.com problem. Cheers out to Amazon.com, they picked up the bike and refunded my account within a week!! Stay away from Kent International."
2,The package arrived with damage,"The tire and inner tube of the bike arrived with a hole. It is obviously that there is no quality control before the bike is shipped. The company promised to ship a replacement set but a wrong one was sent. It has been four weeks and I am still waiting!The Assembly Instruction manual was a joke! It fits may be 90% of the parts actually received. Luckily, the assembly was rather easy."
3,Kent Dual Drive Tamdem Comfort Bike,"I like to be able to ride with my wife, but the seats for this bike are not as comfortable as we like. And the front seat is a little too tall for me so I have to modify it to make it lower and it would not be easy to go up a little incline hills even with both of us paddling. It has 21 speeds, but it still not as fast as it designs for. Other than that, we like the bike very much. We only ride about couple times though. Hopefully, we will enjoy it more next spring or summer."
3,Poor Service,"I was very disappointed in the service. When we received the bike the tubes had a very small slit which would not let them hold the air. We contacted the company and after many Emails they said they would replace them.We have still not received the replacements. We had to buy tubes. It was very hard to do this.Product 3, Service-5."
4,Good,You can enjoy the fun when you ride the tandem. While it's really hard to install it and I received.
1,damaged goods,"upon receiving my bike the carton had been opened. After looking inside, the rear wheel was bent like a pretzel. Someone had obviously dropped the item on end and looked inside. I called for a replacement and had to pay for the damaged one to be picked up. We are still waiting for the second bike. Portland, Or."
2,Wrong color delivery + bad tire tube,"The bike arrived with black body in the center bike frame. It's totally different color that what I expected from the photo, which is silver. After putting the bike together, I rode around the block and the front tire exploded. Bought a new tire tube and replaced it. I didn't bother to return the bike since there is too much hassle in packing and sending it. Overall, the ride is good, but the promised advertisement is misleading on the color. :("
1,Arrived damaged...,"I still have high hopes for this bike, but was disappointed when I received it to find that the front forks were already bent thereby preventing installation of the front wheel. The plastic piece that would normally be inserted to protect the front forks and keep them aligned was floating freely in the box and was damaged itself (which is why it probably didn't stay in place to protect the bike.) I had to lug the large and partially assembled bike to a shop where they are attempting to fix it."
4,Great BUT a few caveats,"Bike arrived undamaged (as compared to some other reviewers).This bike is a lot of fun. It's impossible not to smile when riding it!A few important notes:1) the cranks were loose; had to take it to a bike shop2) the extra large rear gear did not work - the derreauler could not reach it. The bike shop said this happens a lot with cheap-o bikes where the components aren't really made to fit together.3) the shifter cables were actually brake cables; again because of the low cost ""not really made to work this way"" componentryOverall we spent another $150 at the bike shop getting the bike ready to ride. However, even at $400 after the extra $150 in costs, it's still a steal and a lot of fun. Highly recommended, just reserve a bit of cash at your local bikeshop for some tune up items."
4,Decent bike for the price,"I bought this bike as a training tool for my 16 year old mentally challenged son, as a means to help him to develop some coordination skills and learn to balance himself on a bike; while dad does most of the pedaling. I was a little leery considering its manufactured in china I didn't expect much of the bike in terms of quality plus I wasn't sure if my son would take to it. And I didn't want to spend to much money on something that may just sit in the garage. Assembly was easy, just basic hand tools some minor adjustments I was surprised at the quality of the bike for the price. In no way am a I hobby/professional bike guy at all, so for these folks it may not be enough bike but for the occasional bike rides at the campgrounds or weekend park rides this is more than adequate. PLUS... my son LOVED IT! In my book money well spent."
4,Kent Dual Drive Tandem Bike,"Because I had a tandem bike growing up, I decided to get another one. It has been really fun riding around in the neighborhood. We have had no trouble with it at all. The seats are not real comfortable, but we can always replace them.That would be the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.My husband had no trouble putting it together. And I""m sure we will use it for years to come."
5,Tandem Bicycle,A wonderful bicycle! Set-up was straight forward and easy. Little adjustment needed for the derailer or brakes. Many hours of enjoyment already spent on the bike. A great family edition. Lots of fun to ride. The ride is very smooth and the gear shift is very precise.
3,tandem bike with missing parts,"Bike arrived fast in shipping and in contrast from previous reviews was fairly easy to put together using the manual. Only problem is there are numerous parts missing-4 pedal feet, reflectors, and front and rear fenders. Are these a part of the bike (it says they are in the manual). We are planning to call customer service first thing in the morning and request that these items are sent out so hopefully they accomodate our request. We will update our review if we recieve the items requested. We can not test the bike until we at least recieve the pedals. We do not want to return the bike as we am definitely afraid of the shipping costs!!Update as of 12/4/2008: I did recieve some pedals through Kent Bikes.Com. It took a while but they did ship them out to us. They did not hear our request about the outher items such as the reflectors and other items listed above but we do like the bike and ride it often."
4,Consistent with Previous Reviews,"I received this item yesterday. Kudos to Amazon Prime - it arrived in one day!The bike is a great value for the price. All in all, I am pleased with what I got. The construction and components are of good quality. No significant adjustments were needed. There were a few minor scratches resulting from shipping, but that's not a big deal to me. I didn't expect perfection.As many others have stated, the assembly instructions are worthless. They are not even worth looking at. Therefore, if you don't have experience with bike assembly and maintenance, I strongly recommend asking someone who does to assemble the bike for you."
4,Great deal for the money,"I bought this bike just so my wife can exercise with me. The needed assembly was straight forward if you are familiar with bicycles. Forget about using the manual. The drawings are small and confusing. I had an issue with the screws that came with the bike for the forward chain guard, they were too short or its possible it was supposed to have been installed from the factory but they over torqued it and stripped the plastic. I sent an email to Kent Bikes to let them know, and solves the problem with a $1.50 bag of #7x3/4"" wood screws from Home Depo.Rides very nicely, its an attention grabber if you seek it and cost much less than many single seat bikes in the market."
4,Outstanding Bike at an Outstanding Price...,"This is a one beautiful bike. Everything about it says top quality. It rides very nice. It has fat tires, and hence its ride is very soft. The seats are nicer and more comfortable than many other bikes twice as expensive and are made by La-Z-Boy... Many parts of the bike are made of alloy metals to reduce weight. Everyone who saw this bike loved it. I would recommend it in a heart beat. It is a lot of fun to ride with a loved one.The only thing I would change about this bike is the white walled tires. The white walled tires makes it look kind of less sporty, and more like a senior citizen bike. It is like diving a mini van vs. an SUV. BUT, if you are driving it for the functionality, you cannot beat the value of this bike."
4,Good Value,"This bike is an excellent value. The price is reasonable and the quality is decent. We purchased one in September 2007 and have just passed the one thousand mile mark on the odometer. The only parts that have been replaced are the tires, due to normal wear.The design is aesthetically pleasing and is amenable to user modifications. The finish and mechanical components seem to be standing up well to moderate use. It has been used daily, weather permitting and generally logs trips in the ten to fifteen mile range. Longer duration trips are planned, now that spring has arrived in our location.If you are looking for a reasonably priced tandem, this is definitely worth looking into. Have it serviced and adjusted by a local bike shop and you will be well pleased with the product."
3,Kent Dual Drive Tandem Comfort Bike,"Very nice bike for the money , one problem was that the rear wheel bent with no bumps or exceeded weight."
4,Kent tandem,The product is easy to use and put together but the gears need extra care to get in the correct position to reach the three positions on the front derailer. Otherwise the product is as described.
5,Wonderful,"Our nine year old grand-daughter was severly injured in a bike accident when she was seven. She was terrified of riding her bike, but now she loves riding behind her dad! We even transported the bike to Mackinaw Island where she and her dad rode for hours."
3,Adequate for the Money,"We received the bike in good time and in good condition - it was missing the front wheel lock washers, but all else was there. Once we got it put together (+/- 6 hours) it rode well. Tires are sketchy, as mentioned in other reviews, but serviceable for cruising around the neighborhood. Shifting was adequate once adjusted - I mean, this is not a $3000 Cannondale with SRAM Red, so don't expect a lot of precision.I contacted Customer Service to get replacement front wheel lock washers - several days later, I received a nice shipment of headset bearings. Oh well - I just tightened the front axle bolts a little more and went my way.The word here is ""adequate"". Don't expect to take this bike on all-day tours, unless you spend considerable time and money upgrading. For the money though, it's hard to complain (much)."
1,Very poor quality MADE IN CHINA,Received the shamino bicycle and in bold letters on the box MADE IN CHINA. I started to not receive it and have it returned. I took it home and was doing the minor assembly and noted the machining of the fasteners was terrible and the nuts were loose on the studs/bolts they were fitted on. Packaging was just ok...........there was a loss of paint on the seat post from rubbing something. the tires inflation is rated for 45 to 60 lbs. I was pumping up the rear tire after doing the front tire and got to the 45 lbs ok.............then got a loud pop and the tire blew out very loud. As i write this I do not think this bike was advertised made in china........if you want a good dependable shamino bike buy a used one that was made in the USA. Amazon should not sell substandard made in china items.............I learned my lesson about Amazon and you should also.
1,Bent Wheel,"I just got the bike when I noticed that the back wheel had a little bent but didn't think it was anything that could cause a wreck. So my son and I went on I ride and we crashed when the back tire fell of. So my son got third degree burns from the tire scraping against his arm. I broke my Arm, Leg, And back and is now paralyzed. I can hardly do anything and i tried suing the company but they said that in the terms and conditions they mentioned that they are not responsible for any wrecks."
1,Bad bad game,"Do not waste your money kids. This game is terrible, not fun to play and ugly at best. Ok so the visuals are quite nice at times but that is about all. The game is very slow, the whole story line is a joke. Bad game design through and through. There are far better games out to buy for your game cube.The girls rate among the most hideous creatures ever to feature in a game, they look like men!"
2,Takes looooong to load,"Out of the three English dictionaries I have installed this is the one I never use. If I run it ocasionally it takes forever to start (on a fairly equipped 800 MHz machine) and it then usually asks for the CD to be inserted (every 60 days, they say). Thats the point where I normally give up ..."
2,So what ?,"This dictionary is more or less good, but I expected more when I bought it. Yes, it has many words, some useful illustrations and a good pronunciation guide. It also shows the reader the difference between American English and British English, and has some sections with subject-related words.But so what?. I think you can do much better. To start with, the ""Cambridge International Dictionary of English"" does not include a thematic wordfinder. It also lacks examples of the different kinds of letters you might need to write, making that task more difficult. As if that were not enough, the accompanying cd is too slow to load, and does not always work well enough.On the whole, I don?t recommend this dictionary. It isn?t bad, just not good enough. Keep looking and I am sure you will find something better...Belen Alcat"
3,Corps au corps,"This book is a factual chronology of the relationship between Beauvoir and Sartre, particularly as it relates to their extracurricular sexual relations. It is not an in-depth commentary or analysis on how they influenced each other's thinking and writings. I found this aspect of the book disappointing.Attention should have been paid to how Sartre's way of life runs counter to his existential philosophy- freedom in action is paramount to JPS's existential man and yet he succumbs to addictions to drugs and alcohol in his mid-to-later life. Why does Beauvoir give Sartre her uncritical approval to his meaningless, manipulative and lecherous courtships? And how does such compliance reflect on her nascent feminism?I expect biographies of two seminal philosophers to raise such questions and provide some level of explication. Despite these reservations, I recommend this book as it is well-researched and well-written."
5,The human side of genius,"This book vividly sets genuis in a human perspective. It is a sad story. Genine love requires fidelity and the human heart knows this even if philosophical genius doesn't. Certainly worth reading as an insight for any time. Besides, it provides a magnificent and totally unexpected view of Simone's marvelous behind."
4,Tracks:,"Pop Hits of the 1970's features twelve classic hits from the 70s, all original recordings by the original artists.1. Your Mama Don't Dance - Loggins & Messina2. Maggie May - Rod Stewart3.

5,Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory & Technique,"Very good book, very detailed and clear explanations, great pictures. I enjoy it."
5,A must have,This book is a must have for anyone interested in Grappling and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The layout and pictures are great and the authros are some of the most decorated figthers.
5,A must have for every Brazilian JiuJitsu student,"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MARTIAL ARTS BOOK I HAVE EVER OWNED!I have had many books in the past which had small, black and white pictures that really didn't break down the technique into logical components. The pictures in this book are big and in color. Additionally, at each phase of the move a description is included, talking about specific details to do and possible counters to be aware of.I just started studying Brazilian JiuJitsu last year and this book has been a huge help in refining my technique.I think the book contains around 100 - 110 techniques ranging from blue belt to black belt."
4,Also Nice addition,"As an experienced black belt Judo, with a long competition history, I loved this book very much. I am always searching to expand my technical skills. And this BJJ handbook gives me more inspiration to drill my students and myself to new skills."
5,excellent overview of jiu jitsu,"this book is an excellent overview of jiu jitsu techniques. the step-by-step instructions are understandable, although i believe most techniques would be difficult to follow for a complete novice.this book is best described as an excellent reference for someone who is training in jiu jitsu and has the opprtunity to train with a live partner who will give the resistance necessary to effectively apply technique. although a great reference, without training in a club or with a knowledgeable partner you will not learn good jiu jitsu from this or any other book."
5,Gracie JJ Resource!,EXCELLENT resource! The Gracies break it down and give you the theories behind even the most subtle movements backed up by years of experience and the know-how of applying it all!
2,think carefully about your motivation before buying,"this book is not everything it's cracked up to be. as a sport jiu-jitsu manual, it is superb, easily one of the best ever produced. however, as a self-defence manual, it is sorely lacking. the authors make several inaccurate comments, and are clearly not open to new thinking. in particular, the comment that grappling is as effective as striking against multiple opponents is idiocy. yes, fighting against more than one person is very difficult and risky, but striking WILL give you a chance. grappling against two or more people is impossible. also, grappling is bordering on suicide when dealing with weapon attacks (which are not covered in this book). the self-defence techniques seem an afterthought, and do not sit well with the ground work.in conclusion, if you are interested in nhb, then buy this book. if self-defence is your motivation, stay well away."
2,Great for the novice,"This book is great if you know nothing about NHB or Jiu-Jitsu, If you've already been training 2 months or so, don't get it because you have already surpassed what is on here. Also, almost half the book is nothing but UFC & martial arts history. If you'd like to read a good fight book & not a history lesson, look somewhere else. The other reviewers who gave this 5 stars are just huge Gracie fans who will give Gracies 5 stars no matter how bad the book is. Nothing wrong with that but I am unbiased"
5,A masterpiece...,"A wonderful collection of devastating techniques and exquisite pictures.The techniques shown are wonderful and gives a fantastic foundation in the art, all shown in beautiful, detailed pictues.A must-have for anyone interested in the art as a beginner or an experienced practitioner looking to hone his skill."
4,The book we were waiting for,"First of all: with the mental and body conditioning of Gracie Bros, you may fight an ogre even with chopsticks.But, as a self defense instructor, I have to say that these are not the real fighting tecniques Gracie Bros took over the mats all over the qorld, ruling in free fight championships.Anyway, this book is worth its cost, and each serious martial art practioner should read it, as it's clear and with some hint about the REAL Gracie fight method."
5,Great buy!,"If anyone wants to learn some self-defense or just wants to be a better grappler this is a great book. I do not formally take BJJ at any martial arts school but I tried many of the moves on my friends when we live grapple and it helps a lot. I defeated them quite easily even though they all outweigh me by a lot. My wrestler friend couldn't even beat me and he's been wrestling for years and all I did was read a book! This is especially great if your a smaller skinnier guy like me. Better then learning stand up because most likely if a guy is bigger then u he'll take you to the ground. But once your on the ground, now you'll know what to do. Great buy, I highly recommend."
5,"Yes, indeed ...","Yes, indeed this is by far the best jujitsu and martial art books on the market. All the moves are well documented and the pictures are cleared. The only recommendation is that in this book both the attacker and the defenser both white 'gi'; and if one can wear different color 'gi' then it will be whole lot easier to spot the moves.And as an avid martial arts practioner but know nothing of Brazilian jujitsu, I complement highly to the author in methodically, scientifically and convincingly in explaining why Brazilian jujitsu is the answer to the most sorted after question in the martial world without any discredit or discriminate about other martial art forms."
2,For shame! Percy's been butchered!,"Here's the point: Crayola has redone the soundtrack with American voices. So if you think you'll be getting the same gentle British feel of Kipper or Mouse & Mole, forget it. I can only guess what the original acting was like, but in the Americanized version Percy is somewhat of a slow-speaking dolt and the animals are frequently manic. Oh, yes, the stories are still much gentler than what you'd catch on Saturday morning US television, and my 3-year-old loves the animation, but it's not what I was expecting after reading the other reviews here."
4,a better sequel?,"i found this to be better than the sharpe novels. we've got a man whose village is attacked. he swears to find and bring back a holy lance. he goes to fight in the hundred years war as an archer. there he meets allies, gets friends, and intrigues treathens to make him a dead man. BC is great at details. always enjoyable to read his battle descriptions. on the human level, however, he's not as great. no, the descriptions of the people's lives are good. it's how he makes the characters. the talentes, moralistic commoner. the hopeless snob. a lost love. and the main character is attacked by an enemy within his own ranks. BC has a typical way of doing things. i wish he could vary, give the plots more depth, make the characters with more characteristics - some good, some bad. it's a good read. could have been great, but i just can't handle the intrigues and the characters at times"
4,enjoyed,"a wonderful series am going to read them all,and cannot wait to get to the next one.I like all i have read so far"
4,Enjoyed immensely,Gripping page turner. Transports you back to another timeLovers of history and adventures will appreciate Cromwell.s meticulous narrative. Good read.
3,decent,"Not exactly a page turner, but it entertains. I will definitely be trying the second book in the series as I am a fan of Bernard Cornwell, and know he is capable very good writing."
4,Good read,"This book has some chapters that are brilliant and whilst reading those the book is brilliant, however there are some very tedious sections which are a struggle to get through. In the end though Cornwell manages to do the most important thing and creates a character that you care about."
4,Good Medieval Adventure,"The Archer's Tale centres around Thomas of Hookton, an archer who joins the English army in France, after his father is murdered, and an ancient relic, is stolen from the church, when his village is plundered by French bandits.I found this book a fascinating read. The 14th century is brought vividly back to life in its pages, as various battles are fought, based around true events, and the strategies and weaponery used are described very well.Thomas also makes friends, enemies, and has love interests along the way. The mixture of fictional, and factual characters, is very well done, and makes the story that more interesting. An enjoyable read."
3,Archer' s tale,Well written. Good read. Bought the next book in the series. I a looming forward to following the adventure to their finish.I'm'm outside
4,An early draft of Agincourt,"This book was, I think, a first go at Cornwell's 'Agincourt' novel. It's good, but not as finely crafted as the latter. Still worth a read. Better yet, read this, then read Agincourt to see how Cornwell has developed as a writer."
5,The Archers Tale,"A typical Bernard Cornwell novel, artfully written, fast moving and historically accurate. In my opinion he is the master of this genre today."
4,Excellent History and Action together,Cornwell is always an entertaining read and The Archer's Tale holds true to form. Excellent character development makes the reader feel like they are part of the story. Definitely recommend the book to readers who enjoy action based historial fiction.
4,This book had me dodging the arrows as I lay in bed. Fantastic read,"A very entertaining book full of history, telling just what it must have been like not only for the soldiers but also the civilians in the towns under siege. One can only imagine the fear on both sides waiting for the walls to fail and the horrors that must follow. This is the first book I have read from Bernard Cornwell and am so looking forward to reading the remainder of the saga."
2,"Alas, not Mr. Cornwell's best...","Not bad for pulp fiction, but falls far, far short of the standard set by the ""Saxon Tales."" Mr. Cornwell can do much better."
2,Unnecessarily Violent,"Probably an interesting story in the end, but I just can't get through the graphic violence. The story begins with a raid on an medieval English village in which nearly everyone is killed. The survivor begins the rest of his life avenging the deaths of his family and the theft of a religious relic. Sounds promising, no? But after getting through the initial violent beginning the book continues in the same vein.It occurred to me that maybe this kind of graphic violence is what appeals to (or rather is meant for) men who want to read adventure-type books - lots of blood, descriptions of what arrows do to various parts of the body, horses 'screaming' (a particular ugly picture in my mind), and other descriptions of various ancient tools of war. No thanks.I was looking for a captivating historical fiction read on vacation (picked the book up at a used book store). Instead of a book where the story is key I got book with violence as the main character. Too bad."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I must admit that I don't read a lot of historical fiction,but on a friend's advice, I picked up this book and found itto be an interesting read. As a writer, I always am amazed whenan author can reconstruct a past world and set a story in motionwhich draws the reader into it. Armed with only word, there aresome very talented authors of this genre. Cornwell certainly is one of them."
2,Is this for adolescent boys?,"After trying to read Ken Follet's claptrap tome ""Pillars of the Earth"", I was steered to this book by an Amazon reviewer. Unfortunately, it's not much better. I can't understand why these books get such rave reviews. The characters are flat, stereotypical, and predictable. The writing is at a 7th or 8th grade level. The plot is stale and arbitrary. But ooh! It's violent and there's lots of rape and battles, so it must be interesting. Yawn.For the record, I gave up on page 43, by which time the recently-introduced villain Sir Simon had been described as replying ""sourly"" FIVE times in as many pages. Can't these authors afford editors?Garbage.Follow up: I picked this book up again when there was nothing else to read in the house, during a blizzard. It was still unbearably bad."
2,Dissappointing...,"I bought this book some time ago because: 1) someone reccommended it to me and 2) it was set during the 100 Years War. As a holder of a History BA and having a keen interest in the Middle Ages (specifically the HYW) I was pretty interested in this, and perhaps my hopes were set too high. I found it to be pretty predictable, the main character had nothing that would keep me interested in him, and overall I found it pretty melodramatic. I think if I were 16 I might like it much more, but at 28 I have more discerning tastes. I think the main criticism I have about this book, however, is that like Chrighton's _Timeline_ at no point did I feel convincingly like I was in the mid 14th C."
4,Great Historical Fiction...,"As always, this book has been well researched and put together. Cornwell is the master of historical military fiction and he is at his best in the battle scenes. The Archer is a great start to what I hope is a great series. I have read almost all of the Sharpe series and look forward to The Vagabond, which is by my chair at home!"
4,I Wish I had Started Here,"I read THE HERETIC first. I didn't not realize that it was part of this series. It was a good book and stands well on its own. This one does likewise. This volume is supposed to be the first in the series dealing with a quest for the Holy Grail.You would not realize how the Grail features in the story from this book. It centers around an effort during the Hundred Years War to recover the lance of St. George. It grail comes up only very peripherally. All this stuff about lances and grails is just window dressing, though. The real story is a human one.Thomas of Hookton is an archer. He is a fighting man embroiled in a war. In short, he is the kind of character that Cornwell handles so well. It is an interesting read and will most likely teach you some vocabulary a well."
3,"Good, but Not Great","If you've read the very fine, ""The Last Kingdom Series"" and ""The Arthurian Series"", you'll most likely be disappointed in ""The Archer's Tale"". In ""The Archer's Tale"", Thomas, the main character, doesn't come close to the strength of Uthred or Dervel, and doesn't have enough depth to carry the story. The development of the character Will Skeat gave the reader more of a feeling for the man, while Thomas seemed to float through his life, and I found myself bored by the story. Also some of the battle scenes, especially the last one towards the end of the book, should have been better edited. Too long and far too wordy at best, but that's not to say I won't read the final two books in the series.It's hard not to taken away with Bernard Cornwell's writing, but for me ""The Archer's Tale"" was weak in comparison to his other series mentioned above."
3,"Good Military History, Poor Medieval History","Bernard Cornwell novels are my guilty pleasure. He gives a very good soldiers-eye view of battle. Though no one would confuse him with a master of English prose, he writes good fast-moving narrative. His instincts as to which of the secondary sources to trust are usually sound. He talks about tactics, equipment, logistics, and policy intelligently; he always walks the battlefields himself where they still exist. All of the above make this this a good (and fun) popular introduction to the Crecy campaign of the Hundred Years War.On the other hand, his characters are pretty flat and his ubiquitous anti-Christian bias is annoying. This is a very serious flaw in books like this where he is trying to write medieval characters despite deep ignorance and antipathy to their faith.His Richard Sharpe series following the armies of Wellington through the Penninsular War is much better."
5,HAUNTING,"This is one up the better debuts of recent years, right on par with Scorsese's Mean Streets and the Coen Bros Blood Simple. Terrific, minimal storytelling and flawless direction. A talented effort. Lodge Kerrigan shows that he has the potential to become a truly memorable film maker. If the rest of the films he makes are even close to being as powerful as this one, film lovers will be extremely lucky."
4,Disturbingly Clever!,"Clean, Shaven will shake the audience as they follow a young schizophrenic man frantically attempting to find his adopted daughter. The young man is traumatized by serious hallucinations and severe paranoia that emotionally and socially shake his everyday life . As the audience is following the footsteps of the young man, it is next to impossible to avoid attributing some additional characteristics to his other bizarre behaviors. These attributions will influence the audience's perception of the young man and his behavior among other people. Clean, Shaven uses the psychological disorder of a young man as an engine to create a story with true realism that will, in the end, cause pondering."
4,"Honest, disturbing, unforgettable","I'm French and I had read very good reviews about this movie, but I just saw it on TV a few weeks ago, under the name ""Psychopath"". I was really impressed. Sometimes it is rather difficult to watch it, because of the breathtaking atmosphere, and some scenes are really gorey. But it is one of the only films where you really get INTO the head of a schizophrenic, and it's frightening. The sound work is just incredible, with the mixed radio frequencies (even in French version). David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" is maybe the only other film where, from the beginning to the end, experimental sound effects are so important. The plot is maybe just a bit light and blur, but Peter Greene has such a strong presence. And Lodge Kerrigan manages to bring some emotion in a very cold, clinic and stripped down filming: it's not just a brilliant stylish exercise, it's also a deeply moving human artwork. Definitely great, deserves to be discovered."
2,Kind of morbid...,"Had to purchase this book for a college course. I thought it was morbid and at first was a bit confused. If you are a psychology major or someone who enjoy these type of films - you will enjoy it or better yet, understand it more than others...."
2,Unfocused,"The only positive part of this movie was Peter Greene's performance, he did a great job of portraying a mentally disturbed person. The movie starts with no real direction, you're following around a mentally ill man who wants to find his young daughter. After a while you're thinking ""OK, I get the picture, he's disturbed and lost, now what?"" Well, now nothing. There really isn't anything more to this. A pointless detective is added but he's idiotic. If you want to know what this movie is like go downtown in almost any US city and follow around one of the disturbed homeless people for 80 minutes. That's it, nothing more. This didn't didn't elicit a single emotional response from me. It was boring. And all the shots of the surrounding area looked like he was in a garbage strewn dump."
2,****STIGMATIZING**** PUKE,"The movie...ehhh..allright i guess. But it exploits this stereotype of a homicidal maniac that our culture is obsessed with. So its negatives tip the scale towards yakkk. The acting is great, he plays a convincing lead man, Winter. Thats the scary thing, its so believable, yet not true...schitzofrenic people are far different. they can lead normal/average...maybe enlightened, productive lives. The story was told from an interesting angle, through sounds and experiences of a scattered lead character. Theres no doubt that by all common definitions of crazy killers, winter portrays that stereotype excellently."
4,UMM,"This was the second register I ordered from this company. I didn't want to order all that I needed in case I didn't like them. The first one arrived with no issue but this one arrived in pieces as someone else had indicated in another review. It was bent and the louvers had fallen out. However, contrary to another review I read the company was more than happy to correct the situation and sent me a new register immediately. I didn't even have to mess with sending the damaged one back. I would order more from them if they had the odd size I need for my other registers."
1,JUNK,"I should have listened to the one bad review on this item, he was right. it is cheap and cheesy, falls apart. i had to put a few pop-rivets in it and a few tack welds to hold it together to work the way it should. it is just the regular thin model with a damper part added to it that does not fit right over even stay on. Spend the extra money and buy a good one."
5,Exactly what I needed,Ink cartridge works really well - no complaints here. It's been about 8 months since I installed the ink cartridge and there's still plenty of ink left.
1,Does not work,I bought this for HP Laser jet 3050 and it does not work. It prints only 1 column and that also very light. Not sure why it is so bad.
1,Streaky and Bad Quality!,"I am so disappointed with this toner. I was debating between this or the real HP one, and based on the reviews and the price, I decided to give it a try. Well...I got what I paid for. It prints with vertical stripes down the page. So much so that my white printing paper looks gray once it's been printed on. Yes, I have shaken it to spread the ink but to no avail. I now have tons of scratch paper because everything I've printed on so far is trash. It's too embarassing to submit.So now, I'm waiting for my new HP toner this week. It's quality I can depend on at least. I took the risk of buying a refurbished item and I was not the fortunate ones who got a decent-working one."
4,Terrific value,The laser jet toner cartridge arrived quickly - even a day or two ahead of what was projected. Print quality is fine & the item is a good value.
5,Works well on installation,"This compatible brand toner works as expected upon installation. I took special care to follow cartridge instructions (shake several times, remove all packaging tape, etc.) prior to installation. It has only been one week since installation, so I can't comment on number of print pages per cartridge."
2,Compatible brand toner,"Not very good at all. After the first 100 pages started to leave lines and make stripes. Took it out gave it a shake, OK for the next 50 or so pages, than had to repeat. Will pay full price for the real thing next time."
4,Great replacement cart!,"Great replacement for the original cartridge. Only negative is no return mailer for the used cart--HP provides this, would be nice to be able to properly dispose of it.Performance wise--toner works very well--can't see a difference."
3,Overpackaged,"The product works well but arrived in a mass of packaging, which I clearly did not understand. Please stop doing this..."
1,ANGRY,"Since using this BRAND NEW HP cartridge, my printer no longer works correctly. Pages come out crumpled at the top. HP refuses to stand behind it, stating the printer is no longer under warranty. Amazon should not be blamed. They sold me a factory sealed new cartridge.I must now have the printer serviced at my expense due to arrogance and poor workmanship at HP."
1,BOGUS PRODUCT,"The Amazon website shows an HP #Q2612A print cartridge. The item is listed as an HP #Q2612A cartridge. On the bottom of the web page it states that genuine HP parts are guaranteed to work in an HP printer. This is NOT an HP cartridge. A printer letter inside the box states that Amazon decides on what is pictured; not the seller. The seller is making an excuse for not sending the right product. Bait and switch. The ""replacement"" cartridge may be great, I don't know, but it is not a genuine HP print cartridge. Amazon will be contacted."
4,Toner works fine so far!,"The print quality is as good as it was before. The price for two was half as much as the local price for one HP cartridge! Not sure how long it will last yet, but I am optimistic."
2,not very good,"At beginning, it's good to print. But recently, when I start print, one margin of the first about 20 pages will have the print of ink. So I always need to discard them first."
4,Works as advertised.,"I've been using this toner cartridge for about a month. It works just as well as the HP cartridge, but costs much less! I will be ordering more of these cartridges in the future."
1,This is not an original HP item,"I bought this item from AwesomeToner thinking it is an original HP print cartridge. After all, the photo shows an HP item and nowhere in the product description does it state this is anything other an original HP. What I received was some sort of third party or reconditioned print cartridge. Very very deceptive. Unethical. Simply wrong. I know the price was too good to be true, and it was. Now I have to try to return it for a full refund - wish me luck."
1,Cheap product,"Although it says it is ""compatible"" with HP 12 A products, keep in mind that ""compatible"" is not identical to ""comparable."" In fact, although the toner cartridge fits in the printer fine and you can print with it, the printing quality is horrible, the roller makes an awful sticky sound as it prints, and it created such an awful mess of ink blots across all of the printed documents that it used up most of the ink. Eventually it started to print without such dark blots (after about 50 pages), but because it had wasted so much ink on making awful blots, now the prints come out with light patches.In other words, this product is cheap in price and even cheaper in quality. Don't buy it unless you want spare parts."
3,"Worked well for the first 9 months, but then got a vertical line","The cartridge worked well for nine months, but then I started getting a vertical black line on print jobs that would not go away. I'll have to order another cartridge."
1,Don't Buy,"Do not buy this product. The life on it is extremely short, about 1/4 of what is normal. I would use a more reliable source for your toner needs."
1,not reliable,"This new toner worked fine until hitting about 30th page. Then it started coming out uneven, leaving a part of a page faintly printed and unreadable. It works again when I take out the toner, shake it and then put it back and use it. That's not what I want to do every time I print, tho. So I would not recommend this product."
4,Very satisfied,The product came in a very reasonable period of time and works great! I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone. Excellent pricing!!!
3,Chromacast Laser Toner Cartridge,I purchased 2 of these cartridges for my HP 1022nw LaserJet printer. I have used other HP compatible Toner cartridges in this printer and have had no problems. This product arrived on time using standard shipping. It was packaged well and did not have any signs of damage. Usually the printer works well with these cartridges but occasionally one or two consecutive pages will be printed with heavy black lines about 1/4 inch thick across the page at interval of approximately two inches apart. I suspect this is due to leakage in the cartridge but I have not seen any when I have pulled it out to inspect it. Oddly this can occur in the middle of a print job which has ruined some print jobs. Because of this I would not recommend this brand of replacement cartridge.
1,"Great...If you only want to get 3,117 printed pages from this toner","I waited to review this toner cartridge to see how many pages I was able to print with this cartridge.I only print basic letters (nothing with graphics) and was only able to generate 3,117 pages from this cartridge.If you're looking to spend minimal money for a cartridge that only spits out 3,117 pages, then this is your cartridge.Otherwise I would spend more and get a better cartridge with true advertised output."
2,APPLES & ORANGES!!!,"It appears that the reviews for the HP's Q2612A cartridge somehow include both the OEM HP cartridge and HP-compatible one from all the various vendors. As such, the reviews are grossly inconsistent, highly misleading and basically useless!!!"
3,If your expecting HP brand don't buy.,"The Product is not as advertised and the reviews seems a little misleading. Many of the reviews seem to be on the printer and not the cartridge. The Cartridges I received were not HP products and did not come in ""Retail Packaging.""This really infuriates me, but to be honest I didn't really expect that to be the case so I guess I was kinda prepared for the disappointment. Printer companies charge outrageous amounts for ink and toner though so if this cartridge yields even half of what the normal cartridge does, I would buy it again. So far I just put the cartridge in and the print quality seems great. Time will tell if this off brand cartridge is worth the money."
2,ink toner,"Product lost its toner in barely not even a month. Was good and sharp at the start but now no more. I'm not a frequent printer user, probably i;ve use to make copies the most would be 30 copies and the ink is gone. I wish I can get a replacement."
4,nice product,fast shipping. received in very good condition. package looks even better than HP originial one. Wasn't print well on the first few pages then realized that should to shake cartidge a couple times to mix the carbon powder inside. After that it works great. worth of money. highly recommend it.
4,Just a little too little,"No problems at all with performance. They do seem to empty a bit quickly, though."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"BUYER BEWARE! This is NOT a HP OEM product as pictured, but a generic aftermarket cartridge. The ad says ""compatible"", apparently this gives Amazon the right to show a picture of and give a part number for an OEM product, but then ship you something else. I contacted the seller and complained, they did give me a partial refund and let me keep it. It does fit and work in my printer so far. I will update if I have problems."
1,HATE THIS LEAKING TONER CARTRIDGE RUINING MY PRINTER!!!!,"There is a hole at the right side of the cartridge where the toner keeps leaking out, making a terrible printout at every page and spreading to the inner part of my printer @@ This is the worse cartridge that I have ever purchased!! The company should pay back for this failure cartridge!! Now I have to clean up my printer while waiting for buying a new one FROM THE OTHER SUPPLIER!!!"
3,They really get you with the Cartridge prices,"They charge you 200 for the printer and you think it's great, but the toner cartridges last 6 months and cost [...] bucks."
4,Works just like OE,"Works just like the OE. The only thing ""strange"" was that the printer did not respond to the print ""test page"" the first time. I uninstalled the printer and reinstalled it and after that it worked perfectly. Could be a Vista issue."
3,Not Overly Impressed but I'll Order Again,"I did not have high hopes for this product after reading the reviews, but went ahead and took a chance on it anyway as our LaserJet is our secondary printer. It worked fine for about 5 weeks; I'll be buying another just because I can't stand the thought of paying full price, and this is easy through Prime."
4,"Good Toner, only Refurbed.","This toner is no doubt the lowest priced cartridge you can buy. If I were to purchase this from retail, it could cost 4 times as much; there is only one down side that is not mentioned in the information page. This toner is refurbished, not brand new. I do have a problem with that, because it saves so much money. I have heard of, however, a few bad experiences with toner that has been refilled. Personally, the price speaks for itself. I give it 4/5 states because there is a little false advertising, but that does not affect performance."
1,Waste of Money,Never worked - every page had 3 big black lines on them.Replaced plenty of cartridges in my current printer and others. This one is the worst.Don't waste your money.
1,Not worth the money,Cartridge drum was bad on arrival. Had white streaks in all printing. Was not worth the money. Very poor quality. Would not recomment this product!
1,worst catriage I ever had,"This product is so sucks. When I print, all my papers turned to black and there are so many shades that make you can't see clearly at all. Any way, this products is so bad!!!!"
1,Rip-Off,"The toner never worked. the initial print was faint, but i assumed it needed sometime to print effectively. after producing less than medium intensity prints for about less than 50-60 pages, the toner is dead now. the worst buy ever and i would rate this as a rip-off."
1,faulty after a few pages,"These cartridges are standard enough. Unfortunately, this NEW? cartridge began leaving the characteristic large white stripe of a failing old cartridge only a 10 pages after being installed.Makes me sincerely question the quality of this product."
1,Vendor ad for an original/oem printer cart-actually just knockoff,"I looked very closely at the ad and the photo and desc and item number as well as description all indicated orig/oem printer cart, HP. I saw nothing in the ad at all that indicated even remotely that this was just a knockoff that arrived in something that looked in the box like a couple of trash bags around the knock-off cart.-not sure why they had pics of the HP box/oem in the ad. Please note that I sent back to Amazon and they were terrific-I believe that vendor is no longer seeking to sell the knockoffs as real HP cart, but they may very well try again-I suspect they hope that a certain number will not be sent back. Anyway-Amazon was great in trying to get the matter corrected-I will check for my refund but I have no doubt it is on the way from Amazon not from the lousy company."
1,Pictures are misleading - Not a true HP Cartridge,"Thought the price was too good to be true. It was. This is NOT the true HP Cartridge as pictured on Amazon's website (or in their demo video), this is an aftermarket knock-off cartridge that is compatible with the HP 12A cartridge. The cartridge seems to print fine so far (only about 5 pages printed), but I am extremely dissapointed with Amazon's practice of selling or partnering with companies who advertise a factory OEM part in the pictures and description, but then deliver an aftermarket product."
1,Worse Toners Ever,This deal is too good to be true.I bought the toner from E-Max group dba Data bazaar. The quality of the product was questionable. I installed the first toner in October and it worked okay. I installed the 2nd toner in March 2011 and it did not work at all. The pages printed out all black or half black and half washed out. Basically the output was unusable.I contacted the seller and they basically said they had a 30 day return policy so too bad so sad. I had purchased 4 toners at the time.Bottom line if you buy this product make sure you use all of it in the first 30 days so when you discover it is bad (and given the quality you will find an issue) you can get your money back. Don't buy multiples unless you use more than 1 in 30 days.
5,Very good product,"This is the first time we've used this product and we have found it to be very good based on the cost. Charlie gets together with other people at her work and they all go in together on the order and share the cost. If you're a teacher with a small budget it's well worth trying it, we highly recommend it."
5,an excellent choice,purchased two of these. They are very good in terms of quality printout. Don't see any difference with the HP original toner.
3,Gets the job done,If anything this toner cartridge was cheap. When I first got it I had to run the printer through a few cleaning cycles. It is still printing a faint streak down one side of the paper. This is better than just after receiving it when it was printing large streaks down the middle. Not sure if I was burned by buying a refurbished toner or if I just need to replace this printer. Mostly use this for printing coupons and other things for around the house. Luckily nothing is being printed for work/school quality turn in.
3,Print issues in the beginning.,The cartridge is was not printing on the left. Seems to be ok after the first approx 20 prints. Cheap and quick ship.
2,iffy printing quality - good price,"If you don't need your things printed out with dark clear quality, then this may be for you. I've had mixed results including dots on the page, streaks, light color (even with new cartridge), etc. For my purposes, this is fine - but it may not be for you."
1,Poor quality,"When I pulled the seal string it came out ok up to a point when I felt that something is ripping. The rest of the string that came out had visible signs of tear and as expected wat was left caused the print to have a fuzzy line from top to bottom of page. Tried several prints, shook cartridge to no avail.Thankfully, Amazon has quick returns policy."
1,Disappointing,"Streaks, blurs and blank sections,after only relatively light use. This should have lasted much longer.That being said, same purchase from a domestic big box office store was fairly disappointing as well, though it lasted considerably longer than this one.My impression is that HP laser toners in general have degenerated in terms of quality and longevity since I first started buying them many years ago."
1,Poor; gray streaks on right side of every page.,"These things seem to be very hit and miss. The packaging looks like a legit HP cartridge but it sure doesn't perform like one. I suppose you get what you pay for.At this point, I'm better off buying the full-price toner directly from HP, at least then I know it will work properly."
1,Ran out after 3 months of minimal usage!,This cartridge was a very poor value! Used it for three months on EconoMode and it's already completely used up. My old non-HP cartridge lasted for nearly 18 months - which tells you how little printing I actually do. I've bought other cheap cartridges that have lasted much longer... this company's product does NOT meet the benchmark... wish I could get a refund!!!
1,Terrible,installed for 2 weeks and it is already streaking (similar to running low on toner!) I should've spent the $65 for the REAL manufacturer's toner at Office Depot instead of wasting $27!!!!! NO GOOD!
1,HP laser printer toner,"i had ordered a HP Laser toner and the first one i received had minimal ink. it printed like my toner which was empty of ink. It was very disappointing to see how difficult it was to exchange the product to obtain a new toner so i can use it. After multiple emails they agreed to exchange it with the shipping costs. The second one they mailed me was not the orginial HP product which is what i paid for. However, they shipped me a substitute. Now if i wanted to get a substitue i would have ordered that in the first place and save some money. Therefore, this was not a very good experience and i will not order from this website in the future."
1,Don't buy this item.,"The HP toner cartridge is fine, but Amazon sells the identical cartridge as a generic, exactly the same when compared side-to-side, for around 20 dollars. It's time to end HP's monopoly on expensive sales. Get the same thing for much less, and recycle your old cartridge."
1,For all different kind of HP cartridges,"They can make a universal one for all printers... but they would rather make a special one for each series, and a new series every 6-9months, it is easy $ there."
4,Laser Ink-Hp 12 A Compatible,The only reason it is only getting 4 stars is that I have yet to see if it will last as long as the HP 12A cartridge. It came fairly quickly and it seems to be printing just fine. I'll purchase it again if it proves to last as long as the original.
4,Stick with HP despite the price,"While refilled cartridges seem like a bargain, my side by side comparison showed that the print quality was much poorer. I would dearly like to find a reliable supplier or manufacturer of refilled or compatible cartridges but I am not aware of any. We buy the HP original cartridges regularly for our home office. I have never had a problem with the HP originals. The current Amazon price of $61.99 (previously $62.99) is cost competitive with New-egg and HP itself. If you use several of these a year as we do the subscribe and save option for single cartridges is an even better price option (15% savings) even compared to dual packs. The price per printed page works out to something in the range of 2 to 3 cents for the toner."
4,Ink Cartridge,This particular cartridge seems to hold up well and produces nice quality prints. When Ink powder does get low after many copies you can remove the cartridge and give it a shake or two and it is good for more prints. I have never counted the number of prints from this Cartridge...that will depend on individual setup and use. It certainly produces many more than the standard liquid ink type. I may cost twice as much but produces about 4x as many prints.
2,Buyer beware!,"There isn't anything that I can find on this product description that suggests this is anything but a genuine HP cartridge. However, it is not! Admittedly, I knew better given the low price of them. I'm not sure if Amazon has become more relaxed on seller verification or what, but, I've seen more of the same ""deals"" on cartridges and am now hesitant to buy anything."
5,HP 1012 toner replacement cartridge,"The first 200 pages have been clean,sharp pages.Just like a new cartridge. Great price and rapid shipping.If this continues I will be ordering more."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought two cartridges from this company in Aug 2009. I recently tried to use them and both of them were no good. All they print a black page. I have tried everything and nothing will get it to work.I recommend you purchase these cartridges from [...], they are are a little more expensive but at least they work."
1,SUCKS,Broke my printer. overheated and caused smoke/a burning smell to spew out the top of the printer. Now my printer doesn't work at all. Seriously?
4,good tech help,"good tech support - i had failed to remove the black paper from the cartridge and it jammed my printer. a tech explained what had happened, and i was able to find the paper stuck in my printer. back in action in a matter of minutes.."
3,It works but no recycling of the old cartridge,The cartridge arrived and was easy to load into my HP 1022 printer and has been printing images just as black and crisp as the the HP cartridge. The package however didn't include a mailer in order to return the cartridge back to the manufacturer for reuse. However I was able to find information on the HP web site and print a mailer there (if you are at all interested.)
1,Horrible,"This product leaked toner and left a line on the edge of documents. I replaced the toner cartrige with another from the same manufacturer. Again, a line was left along the edge of the page. After shaking the cartrige the print was uneven across the page. Now we are busy trying to clean the machine to remove the toner that leaked from the cartrige. Horrible quality and do not recommend this brand to save money. I just tried a 3rd cartige from the same manufacturer and it printed unevenly across the page. This product should not be offered on Amazon."
2,Misled,"These listings can be misleading; I bought a cartridge from worldwide sellers advertising an HP product when in fact it is not. The cartridge was sold under the header ""HP LaserJet 12A Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging by HP"". If I wanted to select a lesser product then I would have purchased from a listing that is listed as such.As far as the product, I will need to post an update once I have tested the product."
3,Still evaluating,I was a little anxious about trying out a generic brand print cartridge but so far so good. I received it in a timely manner and it was easy to install. I am still evaluating how many copies the tone cartridge will make compared to the original factory replacement.
2,Hit or Miss Product,This is a hit or miss product. I have bought 2 of these toner cartidges. The first one I bought about 8 months ago and it lasted 6 months and was great. Definitly yielding as many pages as HP's OEM cartridge. The second one I bought about a month ago and it was horrible. Had shadows all over the page. Tried printing a lot of pages but keep on happening. I realized that the 2 cartigdes were different brand even though I bought the same product on Amazon's website. It just seems they can just send you what ever brand they want. This time I got a G-Toner cartidge . I returned the product back to Amazon and bought the LD Remanufactured Black Laser Toner Cartridge for Hewlett Packard Q2612A (12A) through Amazon based on reviews. Had two of these so far and the LD are great.
1,THIS IS NOT AN HP PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY!,"This vendor is engaging in deceptive business techniques. This is a ""bait-and-switch"" operation. The advertised product is an HP brand laserjet cartridge. What you will actually receive is a 3rd-party, off-brand, remanufactured toner cartridge of inferior quality (see my uploaded pictures). If that's what you're looking for, well, then the price is pretty good. But if you were looking for an HP brand product, with professional print quality and full warranty coverage, look elsewhere. Amazon has been notified of this deceptive business practice and hopefully will put an end to it shortly."
2,Not a great compatible replacement for HP,"This is not a great purchase. We thought we would try and save some money on the replacement cartridge for our home all-in-one printer. Sadly, it is true when they say you get what you pay for. The cartridge is so powdery and light that each time we print, we have to incresase the darkness settings. Sometimes it is to no avail.I haven't even used the second cartridge and now I wonder if I will. Lesson learned-buy HP products - you will get what you paid for and be satisfied."
1,Never worked. Tried to shake and shake.,"I bought this as a back up and did not open the box for about 90 days - - I know I know wrong thing to do on a 30 day purchase refund policy. So, I know I'm screwed. Just know if you buy it - open it and make sure it works or not right away. If you wait too long you can't return it.Good luck I wish i would have paid closer attention.. with a ""bargain"" like that some are lemons I'm sure. I just got the lemon and now have learned an important lesson.DeedeeTopeka Kansas"
2,Factory-sealed yet defective,"The product arrived on time, was factory-sealed, and appeared genuine as far as I could tell when I opened it; but when I put it in my printer, I got print of inconsistent darkness (dim and clear on the same page) and greyish vertical bars. After a couple of dozen pages like this, I decided that the product was defective, sent it back for a refund, and bought another of the same product from a different retailer (but also through Amazon). The new one works fine."
5,excellent company,"The cartridges shipped did not fit my printer. The return time has expired. Inkers phoned within an hour after I sent them e-mail and promised to send new cartridges, since the wrong ones had shipped. What a great company!"
2,Very messy,It works but when it prints leaves a lot of marks on the paper. It is just to print draft copies. For better copies you need an original cartridge.
2,Not as good as other cartridges,"I have purchased several refurb toners from Amazon dealers and other online venues. This one has only lasted 6 weeks and 2356 copies. In buying from other dealers, the cartridges last anywhere from 2-3 months ranging from 3,134 to 3,600 copies on average. I guess considering price is 1/2 of competitors....toner is also about 1/2 as productive."
1,Horrible,I was surprised at the low price and wondered if it was too good to be true. Sure enough when I received the toner cartridge it did not work at all and an exchange isn't possible. This was a rip off and Amazon should be embarrassed.
4,HP Toner,"The toner was a perfect fit, I do not buy compatible Cartridges but I am happy I did. I saved money on this purchase. Thanks"
1,Expected better,"I normally go a year or two between having to replace a toner cartridge in my printer, but this only lasted 2 months. I should have read the bad reviews, as this appears to be a common complaint. Grrrr."
1,Compatible HP Q2612A,I ordered this Toner Cartridge but it doesn't work! I was able to print ONLY two pages properly and after that pages are printing Blank. I shook the toner cartridge as I have read reviews of other users that had similar issues but mine did not fix it. Not sure if mine was just a bad piece but I hate it!
5,Wow!,"I couldn't believe a compatible laser toner could be at this price. There are quite a good number of bad reviews, but I ordered this because it was worth trying at this price. If it didn't work, I could just return it or recycle it.Wow, the print quality is excellent. It is a BW toner cartridge, and it prints black. No streaks, no stains, etc. I may be just lucky enough to receive a good quality one, but I'd try this again once I use this up."
1,after installation paper jams in toner cartridge,After I installed the new toner cartridge my printer consistently jams before entering toner cartridge. I wish I still had my old one so I could print. For that amount of money and also causing me many problems and business down time I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,Packaging poorly designed,"The protractive plastic strip inside the cartridge became stuck inside despite following directions for removal. The cartridge seems to work so far, but I wonder if the plastic strip left in the cartridge will somehow affect performance in the future."
5,AWESOME,The product arrived on time and works well and so far I have had no problems with printing. (it's been about a month now)The letters are printed evenly without darker parts or shades despite some other ratings i've read. (just make sure before you start printing for the first time that the cartridge is shaken.)I see no difference between this toner and the original HP toner.I am absolutely satisfied with the product and especially happy about the price.
4,"good stuff, works great","Works fine with my HP printer, easy to install. Do not know how far it can go. So far so good."
3,"Print quality is decent, but...","Although I was happy with the print quality, I think Ive had other cartridges last longer. Pretty good bang for your buck though. However, this last cartridge I had leaked toner. Haven't read much about this happening with others, so maybe I just got an isolated clunker. Not sure if I'll get this same cartridge next time though because of the leaky one... that was a mess!"
5,Cheap and nice,"The price is cheap, but the tonner and its package don't look cheap at all.Print quanlity is also good, at least I can't tell any different from the original HP tonner.I'm very satisfied for now. Hope it can last as advertised."
4,Price too good to pass up.,"Price is hard to beat - came well packaged, etc. On first few prints the paper had a light gray haze over 1/3 of the paper, but this went away after about 30 pages of printing."
5,Works for me and the price is right,"I've purchased this cartridge twice now and I haven't been disappointed. The price is excellent and I have had no problems with quality. When the toner starts to run low, I just take the cartridge out, shake it a few times from side to side and put it back in. This gets me an additional 50 pages or so, plenty to last until the next shipment arrives."
1,This Toner Cartridge Does Not Work.,"This HP Q2612A toner cartridge performed worse than the empty cartridge I was replacing. Most of the left side of printed sheets were very faded from the very beginning and even after repeatedly rocking cartridge as per the instructions for before initial use. This product did not work anything like a new, not remanufactured or otherwise refilled, HP toner cartridge. It performed as if it were nearly empty. Since I needed a replacement cartridge immediately after waiting a week for this product to be delivered, I purchased a genuine HP toner cartridge at a local brick and mortar store. The latter worked flawlessly."
2,Works until it doesnt,"The genuine HP lasts 2,000 prints or more. I've never gotten more than 1,000 out of these compatible cartridges. It is still alot cheaper than the Genuine HP, but it is good to keep an extra around since the compatible will die before you expect."
3,OEM is best,I tried some alternate brands of toners but I keep coming back to HP. It delivers consistent results and the most prints per cartridge.
3,Makes my printer sound noisy,"For the price, this is good toner. I was actually surprised. I bought it knowing I was taking a chance on quality. It makes my printer loud, so not sure what that's about, but it seems to get quieter the more empty it gets. Shipping was good, quality of print was kind of light, but still not bad for the price of the toner."
1,Poor print quality,"I realized the poor print quality on the first page that I printed. The ink does not distribute equally to the whole paper so that there are brighter part and darker part on paper. It doesn't look like new printer toner. Yes, it's cheap. That's why. I will not buy it again."
2,OK FOR HOME USE....,"Product did not come in orginal packaging (no big deal....) but the cartridge leaves grey/black lines across the paper. Okay for a home type setting where my 6 year old wants to print out things - not so good for contracts at the office. Cheap, but I won't purchase again."
4,"Great price, good quality and fast shipping!",This toner is very good quality for the price. It also arrived on the 3rd business day after it was ordered.
4,Reliable cartridge,"I have this in an HP1012 printer. Print quality is very good and I can usually eek out around 2000-2100 pages out of the cartridge. I'm not a heavy duty printer, so I usually end up going through about 1 cartridge/year. Never had any problems with streakiness or fading until the end, which can usually be temporarily resolved with a little shaking for a few more pages. HP also includes a free shipping label so you can send back the old cartridge for recycling. Just wish it wasn't quite so expensive."
1,Poor quality,"I know the price is super low, but it's not worth the few dollars I paid for the cartridge. The print quality is terrible -very light and most of the pages have portions that are not even legible the print is so light. It is not worth the expense to return these, but I will try to recycle them with a big box office supply store and at least get some kind of store credit to recoup at least some of what I paid for these cartridges."
5,Product as described,Received the order very quickly and the product was as described.I will quote it: Excellent!
2,I did not get an Hp as described,...it is not a HP Laserjet...as the picture offered. I was dissapointed...wrote to the seller...he promtly answered me...and the point of not selling what you are buying went notwhere.
1,NOT an HP cartridge,"It was under $20 and Great Toners, the vendor, had amazing ratings, so I was willing to risk it. But be warned: Although the description is for an HP cartridge, and what's pictured is an HP cartridge box, what you'll get is a knockoff. I have no idea how long this no-name cartridge will last, but I'm not expecting HP quality. For the price, I'm willing to give it a shot, but I'm angry at the false advertising from Great Toners."
1,Terrible Quality & Too Late to Return!!!,These cartridges definitely prove that you get what you pay for. I have had them too long to return having ordered them ahead of time. The quality of print is terrible with every page being gray and quite difficult to read. Nothing printed with this could be used for business purposes. I am very disappointed and here I am stuck with two of these things!
4,Good Product Slow Service,We were charged for the product almost immediately but didn't receive it until almost two weeks later. Probably will not deal with this vender again.
5,A Toner. Recommended.,A great product. Printouts are as dark as from an original toner and last as long as the same. I'm using this toner on my HP 1020 for 2 years. I didn't faced any problem so far.
3,"It works, but leaves a dark streak down the middle of the page","I would pay more next time for the real HP ink cartridge. While this cartridge is one third of the price, it leaves an ink stain down the middle of the page, even when I shake the cartridge. I like and need my printouts to look nice - especially because I often work from home.For the buyer that does not need to worry about printing quality, this is a great buy!"
1,Streaks!,"The toner was complete junk. Every page I printed had a black streak down the far right hand side of the page. I took it out, examined it, and tried to clean it, but it still streaked. It also left chunks of dried toner on some documents.I finally took it outside, smashed it up, and threw it away."
1,Didn't Work For Me,I thought I would save some money and buy this cartridge instead of the HP one. All I did was create a lot of problems. It printed with specks on the pages and then black lines. I would have to remove the cartridge and clean it and it would work for a couple of pages then the specks and black lines would come back. I finally just ordered the HP cartridge and I haven't had any problems. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Printer Cartridge,"HP printer cartridges work just fine, and better than any substitutes you can get, of which there are many. However, you pay for the privilege."
2,4 out 5 worked - 1 had a bad drum and didn't work,"Fair enough price with adequate amount of toner in each, however, one was bad from the get-go with a bad drum and unable to print properly. Used it in different printers and all gave the same thick black lines all over the page. Unfortunate really as I thought I had found a decent way to supply my office with toner without resorting to eBay or expensive local options. Will look for another vendor."
2,You Get What You Pay For ...,"The physical cartridge works well, and I trust from the other reviews that it will last. However, my experience is that the ink, the toner itself, is definitely not the same quality of the hp. At first I noticed a slight streak, more like a strip about an inch wide of ink chips going down the page. Next I noticed in that same strip, the ink does not adhere to the page as it should. There are tiny chips from the letters that come off the page.Furthermore, I tend to work with my documents on the page, and as I edited, crossed things out, rewrote in the margins ( pages lie around on my desk for days as I work out kinks of my writing ), it was clear the ink chips off and simply does not last like that of the hp. I don't mean the whole page becomes illegible. I'm talking about chips, but clearly noticeable. This is not what I want, especially if I want to send things out in a professional setting."
5,Laserjet does its job,"This toner cartridge is for the HP 1012 (and others). As fas as toner goes, this one lasts a long time. I use it often and for heavy duty printing, including resumes on resume paper, term papers for school on high quality laser paper, and websites, which usually contain images that come out in black and white, using up more toner. I would say that the toner gave me just about 2,500 sheets, and it is just now fading. When you balance the price of this printer with the price for toner every 2,500 sheets, it is a very good deal (less than 3 cents a page when calculating just the toner). My printer does not make any noise with this toner! If you have this printer, then you wont be sorry when using this toner replacement."
3,It Works,"This is a toner FOR HP, not BY HP.It fades the entire paper as it prints, but since this is my first time using non-HP cartridge on my HP Printer, it would be too quick to assume all the toners from this company will do the same.Fading is not really noticeable, and it will not be a problem unless you need to have the pure white background (or you want the pure white background) when you print.It was a lot cheaper than OEM HP toner, and for printing out simple texts and forms, I wouldn't pay more to get a little brighter background."
2,Problematic. I'd avoid it.,"I gave this 2 stars instead of one because eventually 500 pages later, the line going down every page I printed went away. The quality was never perfect, and I often had weird splotches. No, it wasn't my brand new laser printer. It was the cartridge. The fact is, you're taking a risk with the remanufactured toner cartridges. In my case it wasn't anything more than an annoyance because I was in grad school, and most of the stuff I printed up was to workshop with my peers. But I couldn't use it for anything professional. I have since purchased a brand new toner cartridge, and it works perfectly. This is not to say that EVERY remanufactured toner cartridge will have performance issues, but mine did."
2,Poor Quality,"I had to use this product because I was out of toner, But the quality is poor and the prints are not very clear and visible just like it is going to run out again, with the exception that these cartridge is supposed to be working like new. I have seen and work with much better product before and this does not meet any of the standards. Again this is a very poor quality replacement."
1,It didn't work right from Day-One,"Almost from Day-One this toner was spotty. I shook it and it worked for a few pages. Then the same happened again and again. When it's not working, almost half of a page won't print or is very sparse. I don't recommend it because it's a big hassle.*** UPDATE ***I got less than 100 pages out of this -- and I almost never print graphics -- usually only a few paragraphs per page."
3,Toner refills,These toner cartridges did not last as long as I had hoped they would. I don't know that I will order them again.
1,Empty after 2 months,I purchased this because it was so much cheaper than the branded cartridge. It has lasted just 2 months with little use. Previous expensive branded cartridges have lasted many months to over a year.
2,Defective cartridge,"I purchased three of these cartridges back in March 2011. The first two worked just fine. The third was defective. It printed a black smudgy line along the right border of all of my paper. At first I thought it was my HP laser printer and tried cleaning it. However, I discovered after replacing the cartridge that the problem was with the toner cartridge. I would hesitate to by another cartridge from this company (Factory Depot)"
3,It Is Just A Toner Cartridge,"Nothing to get too excited about, it is just a toner cartridge. Definitely better than the cheap refilled ones."
1,Very low quality,I purchased two toner cartridges from this company. The first one didn't give me 100 copies until it ran out. It didn't cost much and I didn't get much. My last purchase from this rip off company.
3,You get what you pay for,"Pretty good remanufactured printer cartridge arount 80% off the HP replacement price. It works great, the only problem I've noticed is that it gets out of alignment when you are printing double-sided pages every once in a while. All I've had to do is take it out and back in and this usually aligns it again."
5,Great Product and seller!,This item was exactly as described. Works great and I would recommend this seller!
1,Lacked Toner,I am going to have to order another cartridge since this is not working too well. Everything is coming out real light.
2,Fair quality at a cheap price,"If you are just looking to get the words on the paper then paying around $20 versus $60 is a good deal for this toner. However, for me, right out of the box, there was a defect in the toner catridge that caused a spot to appear on every sheet of paper. Now maybe this could happen with an HP catridge, but it never has for me, and maybe this was just a bad catridge.Either way I have decided to return it and stick with original HP. I thought to me a little lesser quality wouldn't matter for the $40, but I decided it did."
2,Quality not up to par,I purchased these for business use (home office) and was not satisfied with the appearance of the printed output. Have gone back to HP originals.
2,"Great toothbrush, Bad Battery! Stay Away!","I owned both Cybersonic 2 and Cybersonic 1 versions. I have to say that it is a pretty revolutionary toothbrush. Very easy to use and cleans excellent without a doubt. The only problem is the battery! It usually dies very fast and cannot be replaced. Fast means even in few weeks. I followed all charging instructions, yet had no luck. This is not a single case, even a replacement toothbrush from ""Bed Bath & Beyond"" had the same problem. I've had 3 of these, but I finally got the clue! My recommendation to you is stay away from this product, it is probably a waste of your money. Moreover, Amden Corp. which is the manufacturer of this product is known for their horrible attitude and customer service. They were reported to the Better Business Bureau by hundreds of unsatisfied consumers."
4,Never Cleaner,"When I first purchased this toothbrush, I was a little hesitant to believe it could do what it said it could. My room-mate has had one for years and swears by it. So I went out and bought my own. After the first time using it, I could tell the difference. I no longer had that feeling of my teeth being dirty only a couple of hours after brushing them. My dentist also notice the difference in my teeth. I was never one for flossing my teeth, because let's face it, flossing is time consuming. However, with the already strung flossing heads, it is not as time consuming as it was. I can now take better care of my teeth and not spend alot of time having to do it. This is one product that I would gladdly recommend anyone getting."
2,Buy something else!,While the brush does work great... the brushes are WAY to expensive to change when you should... customer service is NON existent! I bought 3 of these for family members but now that I need brushes for 3 family members... they charge me for each set! Even though they are all coming to same house! $25 for brushes every few months! NOT worth it! NEVER AGAIN!
2,Bummer,"I listened to this once and then shelved it. Not what I expected- I think the other ""Best of"" is better (will letcha know!)"
4,Terrific Collection Of Their Later Work,"No collection of sixties pop music is quite complete without the work of the Animals, especially (in my humble opinion, the later work including a number of selections contained in this CD. From the big hit ""Don't Bring Me Down"" to ""Help Me Girl"", from When I Was Young"" to See See Rider"", there are a lot of great cuts here. My personal favorites are ""Monterey"", ""San Franciscan Nights"", and of course, the mind-blowing ""Sky Pilot"", an eery psychedilic diatribe against the Vietnam war. Also contained herein is ""White Nights"" and ""Winds of Change"". All in all, a great representation of their later work, and one I am glad to have in my collection. Enjoy!"
5,Great music from great generation,"This album has many of the great hits of Eric Burden and the Animals.Had the LP, and the cassette tape.I have looked for the CD version for a long time and was pleased itwas available. Includes the cross-over right to left speaker sounds popular in the 60's-70's music recordings.A good addition to the Best of the Animals CD."
2,Awful Sound Quality,"This is not a ""best of"" or ""greatest hits"" collection, too many songs are missing for that. The sound quality is awful and the value of digitally remastered recordings becomes apparent when you compare this 1991 Polygram release to the 1987 Abkco release The Best of the Amimals."
3,Waiting For The Nitty Gritty....,"Though this book was an interesting read it felt as if I was reading a long intoduction to Tantra that never actually got to the ""nitty gritty"". I did giggle a few times but it never really got to the heart of it. If you really want to know about Tantra I would read another book. That's what I plan on doing. This is really an intro to Tantra and never gets into the ""how to"" about it. It bounces around about all the benefits but never tells you how to start with the exception of a few choice exercises and then still doesn't go into much detail. Hopefully the next book (Sex and the Perfect Lover) will shed more light and be of more help because that is, in essence, why I'm reading these. To help my own marriage. It really left me wanting to know where the rest of the information was. :("
2,disappointment,"Had great expectations for this book, but it was a disappointment. It contains more reviews from people who reported went to Tantra courses than information, guidance, or new ideas. A let down."
3,Just okay.....,"This was okay, though not for my keepers shelf. I liked the main characters, there was some pretty good humor, just not a lot of action."
5,I love them,"Yes, they aren't for everyone. Some of us love them, others hate them. I love munching on them while I am working at my computer. Yes, they are a little fishy and if you inhale while opening the bag, you might get sick, but boy, once you get past the smel... mmmmmmm. Don't buy a lot until you try them. I am about to order 20 more bags."
5,I love Shrimp Flavored Chips,"These things are addictive! I used to buy these at a grocery store near me, but they stopped carrying them years ago. I bought like 4 bags here on Amazon. I think they made it 2 days! Better than Jay's potato chips. I really can't stop eating them!"
1,donot buy this,"if you like eating fried fish then be my gust ,but if you dont buy somthing ealse please i am regrating this item why did i trust this shrimp ,its FISH not shrimp.and its gross like the comment above me"
3,good deal but not perfect...,"This made our king bed feel very much like a thermarest mattress. It is very comfortable and we are glad we went with at least 3 inches. The biggest problem is that the pad is rolled up for shipping and this hurts the shape of the pad. It does not fully reach the sides of our mattress. Although it has stretched out more over the past couple of weeks, it is still coming up short. Since we don't sleep on the edges, it doesn't affect the performance but my wife doesn't like how it looks."
1,2.5 lb density is too low..,This memory foam is only 2.5lb density. Would suggest getting at least 4lb for good support. 2.5lb is not worth the money.
3,hot and stinky,"Yup, it smells. Granted, my apartment's smell wasn't all that before the mattress topper, but this certainly doesn't help. I also woke up in the middle of the night a few times to shift because the areas where my body was in contact with with topper got really hot - like when you've been sitting in certain chairs too long and your butt heats up to about 110 F.I still give it 3 stars though, because it's really comfortable, and it's not the first hot and stinky thing I've allowed on my bed for the sake of comfort."
2,Memory foam mattress topper,Received product within days after ordering. Was very excited thinking finally I would get a good night's sleep without feeling the metal springs sticking in my back. It did prevent the springs from poking me at first but what I soon found out is that the product wears out very quickly. Also I could barely cover it with my fitted sheet which kept sliding off during the night. The foam topper wasn't that comfortable after about a couple months. I kept flipping it over thinking I would get more comfort but soon that didn't work. I suppose the foam mattress would be alot better than the topper even though it is alot more expensive.
4,Soft but HOT HOT HOT!!!,Great padding for hard mattress and good support but we had to change comforters because it increased the temperature significantly of our bed! No good for hot climates.
3,"Okay, but have received better","I received this mattress topper and when I attempted to unroll it, it was so crushed that it wouldn't lay flat. Hopefully, it will relax enough for us to sleep on it tonight."
1,poor packaging. Did I get what I ordered?,"I received this item in an open, unsealed box. The UPS lady was like...""its weird..it came like that."" In the box was a roll that turned out to be a black garbage bag with a topper inside. This item had obviously been returned, repackaged and sent to me. There was no markings on the item or within the box to let me know what company made this topper. When I unrolled the topper I discovered it was for a full bed, not a queen. Furthermore it did not become ""spongy"" like it was supposed to. It just stayed flat and did not expand. It did not even have that awful smell toppers have when you just open them. Very disappointing. I suspect a cheap substitute was sent to me. I bought another one at Wal-Mart instead. Amazon did return my money which was the only good thing about this experience."
4,Great for back problems and long lasting!,I have had this mattress topper 4 years now and it is still as good as it was when we first got it. My husband and I both have back problems and I sleep much better now. I am amazed at how long it has lasted and how much better I sleep.
4,Sleep Better 3-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper,Sleep Better 3-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper5 stars
5,Affordable Luxury,"I bought this to use in a motor home with a rather cheap mattress. It was the perfect addition. My sleep has definitely come much more quickly and lasts longer. The item arrived intact, complete, and quickly.A happy customer."
5,Like getting a new bed!,"I bought this because I have an older mattress that's too hard for me, and I often woke up stiff from sleeping on it. This topper makes all the difference! I can sleep again, and I wake up feeling great! It really is like buying a new bed, but alot cheaper.My only complaint is that the topper is slightly smaller than queen size, but honestly for this price, I can live with an inch gap around my bed."
3,3 inch memory foam,Five stars for comfort and support. 1 star for initial chemical smell.Instructions said to air for 24 hrs before using. Took a week of airing outside before I could bring it into the house. Smell is still noticeable but not unpleasant after several weeks.Comfort and support is outstanding. Any bad back will love this!!Pros and cons as with any product. Would buy again.
5,Finally comfort has come to Afghanistan!,Shipped on the 2nd and arrived to an APO in Afghanistan on the 7th. I'm pretty sure that's a record. Night and day difference to how I sleep! Kudos to the product and to you for amazingly fast service.
5,Love it a lot,"This foam topper has made my sofa bed useful. The mattress that came with the sofa bed was too hard and uncomfortable. Using this foam topper, we now have a really useful and comfortable spare bed. Two average size adults are able to sleep on it comfortably. If you are a bit on the heavy side, other reviews indicate that this may not be good enough, but for us it's great."
4,Sleep is Better,"When this foam mattress topper arrived, it looked terrible. Too short, all wrinkled. Doubted it would ever be right. Laid it on bed and left it for a day. Next day, it was flat, high, and incredibly comfy. Fit the bed exactly. Our sleep has never been better. Highly recommend."
5,comfy!,"This was a great purchase; it really helped my back feel better. Even after being shipped all the way to Korea, it still works wonders. I recommend this for anyone with an uncomfortable mattress, and for those of you who know a college student, they will LOVE YOU if you buy this for them."
3,weeellll,"delivery was extremely fast and efficient - buuut - up to today , i have not been able to sleep on the mattress since it has a very, very strong unpleasant odor which i can not eliminate"
5,Heaven!!,"I bought the king size last week. It took 24 hours to lose the ""memory"" of being in the box. It also does smell a little like bandaids. But, the quality of sleep I get has improved dramatically and has also reduced my husband's snoring - Bonus!! I will be buying one for my RV and another for my boat. WOW."
3,TOPPER,WE LIKE THE MATTRESS TOPPER HOWEVER AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS IT STILL HAS A BAD CHEMICAL SMELL. DONT KNOW IF IT WILL EVER GO AWAY. LAST YEAR WE BOUGHT A 2 INCH TOPPER FROM SAMS CLUB AND IT HAD A CLOTH COVER WITH A ZIPPER AND AFTER 2 DAYS THE SMELL WAS GONE.
5,Go To Sleep!,"I purchased one of these wonderful toppers back in September and love it so much! My daughter came to visit and was laying on my bed and said she had never been on such a soft, wonderful bed.This purchase was for her and her husband for Christmas. They are extremely happy with the gift. I was uncertain about the size, but thought I remember them having a king size bed, so that is what I purchased. They have a queen, so she cut the extra off and made pillows!There is not enough I can say about this mattress topper. It has made a huge difference in my life. I have serious back injury and have a great deal of trouble sleeping. NOT since I made this purchase!We ALL love it!yes, it IS unruly when you unroll it and it takes a couple days to ""puff up"" and get the smell out, but it is SO worth it. Do whatever you need to do to make it work, but buy this thing and go to sleep!As stated previously, you do feel like you are in a cocoon and it does retain body heat, so shop accordingly."
4,Foam topper is very good,"I was worried about feeling hot and in a hole but it does not have a hot feel. Very comfortable. At first I did feel like I was climbing out of a hole when I turned over but I think I turn less now. Also notice that I often sleep an extra hour on this pad. Might be a bit on the soft side but I'm 6'4"" and 280 pounds, aged 76. I really do like the pad.Order king size for queen mattress. Didn't have a problem with the smell which surprised me. A nice plus: a queen fitted sheet and mattress pad fit nicely on just the topper.....stays in place....so you don't need to get deep pocket sheet to put over both the pad and mattress.Bob"
1,Dimensionally Incorrect and very Disappointing,"This foam mattress topper was delivered today, and there is not a prayer that this is as advertised. It fits a double bed not a California King, and we have had it unrolled and airing out (terrible initial fumes) for some time now. Very disappointing, and I hope it can be returned and not at our cost!"
4,Good value,"I love the thickness and price of this memory foam topper, but I wish it would fit the mattress better. It is about 2 inches short on the top and bottom of my king mattress. I even made sure to measure before I ordered and am a bit frustrated that it doesn't fit up to the king as I would've hoped. If you don't mind that, then you'll probably love this. Oh yeah, the scent does fade with time."
4,"Good review - Sleep Better 3-Inch Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Topper, King","The only problems we have encountered with this product that it is a little shorter than the actual matress and that it smells. I think with time the smell will go away, but being newly pregnant, it is hard to sleep on with the smell."
5,Perfect for my college girl,What a difference for the dorm bed! My daughter loves it and is sleeping well (or so she tells me).
4,Really helped our RV mattress,"We bought the memory foam topper to put on top our camp trailer mattress. The original mattress is really BAD. It considerably improved the ""sleepability"" of the bed. We don't have any other foam mattresses so it took some getting used to. The mattress conforms to one's body so turning over can be somewhat daunting. We bought the king size to go on our ""trailer"" queen size bed (which is shorter than a regular queen) since we were going to have to trim it anyway. Turns out that the width was close enough to the queen size that we only had to trim for length. That was really easy with a good sharp long bladed knife. So, for those of you out there with an uncomfortable RV mattress, this is a good solution."
2,Did the reasearch and very dissapointed Good Info for you,"I live in bush Alaska and teacher housing is great but the mattress not always the best. I searched for a long time to get the best price and quality. Price is good but expected quality, not really. I found out you want a foam topper that is four pounds, you are to base the thickness 1-5 inches on your weight. So, I got three inches because my husband and I weight 209 & 250. I just didn't get the comfort I was searching for its very firm. I did have friends that got four inches and recommend that they about same weight as us. Brand unknown.No problem with smell I sprayed it with vinegar and had no issues. I had to do that to get the smoker smell out of my apartment and it worked great with the mattress topper. I did buy a king and cut off extra for my queen bed.Make sure you do your research. I can't tell you about if its warm elements you may read b/c we live in Alaska. No heat issues."
3,It's not bad,"Contrary to the other review, mine didn't have terrible initial fumes and it fit as described. I'm not sure if memory foam is all its cracked up to be but the product is as stated."
5,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing, works extremely well for twin extra long bed in a dorm room. Would recommend to any college student."
4,Son loves it,I bought it for my teen son with scoliosis. He says he sleeps alot more comfortable now. I may buy one for myself.
5,Totally Awesome,"Prior to my purchase, I had not gotten a good nights rest in a long time. After putting down the Mattress Topper, I have not slept better in years. I actually can hardly wait for bedtime because of the good rest that I get from this memory foam."
3,Sleep Better 3 inch Visco Memory Foam...,"I bought this product because I was having lower back pain. I think this is a nice mattress, it didn't stop my lower back pain. I think I have other issues with my back. This mattress is a great product."
4,Good Mattress Pad,"Good mattress pad at a great price. It fit my bed perfectly and is comfortable. I do have a slight problem with the fit of my sheets. The newness smell was completely gone in about 2-3 weeks. However, it is not a fix for back or neck problems. Please go see your Doctor."
3,It is OK,"The pad did stink for about a week, but not as long as a pillow I bought. It is a california king, a smaller than a normal king, I never knew there was a difference in king size mattress. I am not as sore now when I wake up, but it seems a bit too soft. Maybe a 2"" would be better for me."
3,poor density,"I ordered this item for our motor home since we both have back disc problems and have a tempur-pedic be, We were hoping to obtain something similiar in comfort by using this as a topper to the existing bed in the motor home. It wasn't as dense as we had hoped and as a result ended up having to us and 'egg crate"" topper along with it. I guess short of buying a tempur-pedic bed or spending a fortune on a topper it is as good as it's gonna get."
1,Not the right size,"Well, first of all this topper came in a generic looking box that pretty much fell apart the second I got it from the post office. I removed it, flattened it out the best that I could and let it expand. I placed it on my queen sized bed and it's way too small... I have read other reviews and know that it needs a few days to fully expand. It has been 3 weeks now and I'm sure it's expanded to it's fullest I measuered it and it is 55 by 75 inches, that would be twin sized not queen. It's too late now for me to return this and how would I repack it anyway? I suggest anyone that wants a memory foam topper buy a name brand one, not this. It's not fun wasting $100."
1,Strong Chemical Odor Like Stale Cigars,This mattress topper has a strong chemical odor that my wife and I agree is very much like the odor of stale cigars. It fits perfectly and is very comfortable but we were only able to put up with the odor for two nights. Since it is impossible to repack it in the original box (it expands)and return it I will be airing it out in a space above the garage for about 3 months. Very disappointed.
2,WARNING: Mattress toppers are all too small,"I ordered a queen. It is almost a foot too small in both directions. Others consumers are complaining about the same problem, so it is not isolated. This is unacceptable product labelling and there should be a warning, or the item should be pulled."
1,unsatisfactory,"This item has too much of a chemical smell, is very heavy & bunky, and the size is irregular (you won't be able to use contemporty king/queen/full sizes to match-up with the length & width of your bed). I'll have to do a lot of alterations to get this to fit.A. WilliamsNY, New York"
5,a deployment must!,"I bought this because I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and when I'm not sleeping on a cot I'm on a blown out junk mattress with springs poking me and making my limbs numb! I wish I wouldn't used this mattress topper from day one, I sleep more comfortble than I have in years. No tossing and turning just hit the rack and crash! It takes a few hours to relax after you unpack it but then it's ready for slumber. It is bulky, rolled up about 30"" diameter x 25"" wide, so while it is more portable than a full size mattress it's not something you can just throw in you ruck. Worth every penny and it arrived in about seven days from when I placed my order."
5,I wasn't Sure!,I have had this memory foam on my bed for abouth a month and at 1st was not sure what I thought. I have come to love it. My bed is firm and that is the way I use to like it but as I get older my taste have changed. Time to get memory pillows.
5,Great Value,This was a great purchase and I would do it again. I have a bad back and now can get a good nights sleep and wake up not stiff and hurting.
2,Horrible smell & too hot!,"This was supposed to be a great gift for my sister and brother-in-law to enjoy. The odor from this was very similar to fish oil smell. It aired out for a few days. Then when placing it on their bed, it was very dense and hard to put into position. It was somewhat comfortable at first, but it was too thick and too hot. My sister and brother-in-law's backs were sweating...or whatever side they slept on as they tossed and turned all night. As the other part of their bodies were cold. This was a great idea, but not for them...too much money for us to spend on their Christmas gift. We are sending it back and now have to pay $20 shipping to return it and get our money back. What a hassle for them and for us as a gift giver. Not recommended AT ALL!"
5,Good quality,Would like to be able to download templates to use with this size card. Having problems finding them via hp website.
4,Good photo cards,"I had purchased these in the past at Staples, but neither the store or the online Staples had them anymore, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Overall, I love them, but there are a few downsides that I've experienced:1. They only come in glossy. I prefer matte finishes.2. The program that comes with it gives you the option of borderless cards on some choices. Sounds great, right? Not so much - it simply looks sloppy in my opinion without the border and doesn't print very evenly either.3. The included software gives you many choices for things like kids birthdays, but not as many good choices for adults, especially males. I often had to improvise by selecting a different kind of card (i.e., thank you card) and personalizing it for a birthday.Other than that I've been very pleased and so have the people who have received them. They make wonderful invitations as well."
3,Not to my expectations...,"Well, on the overall, this d20 game supplement isn't a bad product, but it's not what I would have liked to get. This Atlantis is described as to fit with the Classical Greek period (Plato was the first to speak about Atlantis). As such, you get an history of Atlantis, new character races, 4 new prestige classes, a few skills /feats /spells /etc. making this product an excellent supplement if you want to run a campaign set in ancient Greece, and/or Egypt. In such a setting, Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, etc. would be ridiculous; so you would get a good alternative with the races given in this booklet, which fit well in that kind of mythology.However, as far as I am concerned, I was deceived by Twilight of Atlantis. I would have liked to get something more futuristic (of the tech-magic kind; reminding of the last Disney movie), and not related to ancient Greeks. If this is what you would also like to get, this supplement won't be up to your expectations."
4,The Joy of Being Fruitarian,"This is a very sweet and inspiring book. The author is quite endearing.The recipes are fun, although being fruitarian means every meal is different and interesting.The book is an encouragement to try out something new."
5,This book truly is the bible to sex!!,My wife and I have been married for 14 years now and our sexual lifes were a little less than gratifying. After we recieved this book it was just like when we had first gotten married. This book is truly the bible to sex!!
5,AMAZING GUIDE!!! MY WIFE AND I LOVE IT!!!,"My wife and I have been together for 10 years now, and were in need of some enhancement in bed. Not that it was bad or anything, but just to spice things up a little bit. We started with the Kamasutra book. Let's just say we were expecting a little more. So I purchased this book, and was amazed from the moment we opened it up. The pictures are perfect ilustrations, and the words and descriptions that the author uses are amazing. My wife and I were on a hour drive and she decided to read the book out loud to me. By the time we got to our destination, we couldn't keep our hands off of eachother, and were so ready to pull off of the road and try some of the positions out for ourselves. I can honestly say that our sexlife has improved since we got the book. We even had the guts to pull it out at a party for our guests. Now we've got everybody buying this book."
3,good book could have been better,"I read that one person said the pictures were fuzzy. That is an understatememt. I guess it was done to ""tone-down"" the explicetness of the book. Clear images in black and white or color would have been better. Two stars for pictures.The content of the book was a little above average (4 stars). There were many positions and there were some interesting diagrams and chapters to read.Overall, it was a good book that had some useful information, but just don't get your hopes up too much."
2,Terrible pictures,"I was really disappointed by this book. After reading all the raving reviews from previous readers I ordered it and when it arrived I was very disappointed by the pictures. They are mostly black and white, very small (Expect 6 pictures per page, the guide doesn't have many pages) and of such poor definition, almost fuzzy, that you have to concentrate really hard to try and find out which part of the body belongs to which individual. It looked fairly complete, with twosome, treesome, foursome and the models had beautiful bodies although their hair style is almost a parody of the late seventies. I really didn't like this book and although it might be complete, I think this book needs a fresh new look with recent pictures of good definition."
1,Don't support Derrick Grant!,This album shows a weak side of the band. One that attempts to reach the epiphany that Mahavishnu Orchestra once attained. If you buy this record you ultimately disgrace the real pathology of the band. This pathology is impulse. Look for Other TOI albums elsewhere. Don't buy this album!
1,Don't waste your money!,My daughter who is a blonde got lice from school. Since her hair was light it was so HARD to find all of the nits. I bought this hoping it would help..but it really didn't. It attached to all of her hair..so EVERYTHING was pink. I personally wouldn't buy this product again.
1,Not Worth It...,"I was very disappointed in this product. We were having a lot of difficulty fighting off the lice. When I read the description and expected results for Neon Nits I was very excited. However, when sprayed on dark hair you couldn't even see it. It didn't do any good and was a complete waste of money."
1,Neon Nits Lice Egg Locator,Don't waste your money. It turned my fingers pink for 3 days. Doesn't work good for burnette hair....at ALL.
1,Dont bother purchasing,"You might as well go buy the pink colored hair spray, this is what it reminds me of. Don't waste your money on it."
4,Neon Nits worked great for me!,I have used this product 3 different times when my kids were little and it worked great! It took a lot of time out of the searching and combing process. It did tinge my blond's hair a tiny bit pink for about a week but I rather have a child with a pink tint to her hair than a head full of lice.
1,Hot Pink Mess,This product made a mess and didn't do anything extraordinary. I won't buy this product again because it is not necessary to find nits. It doesn't make the nits come out easier and your still have to do all the work plus you have this pink stuff everywhere. My daugghters scalp was stained and so were my hands. I tried to use gloves but couldn't graps the hair good enough to remove the nits so I had to take them off!
4,"Ingenious design and fun to drive, but not perfect","I've had his amphibious vehicle for 5 months now. Initially, it worked great: goes fast on pavement, rear wheels rotate back to become propellors in the water. It doesn't go very fast in the water, but steering works well. The lighted front & rear lights are pretty cool. The remote works well and is easy to use, with 100-200' range. My complaints are that the car only goes at one speed: there's no range of speed to select, only fast or off. The other fatal flaw is that at some point in the last few months, the seal to the battery compartment was compromised and there was leakage of water into the battery, causing corrosion and a failed motor. I didn't check inside every time I pulled it out of the water, which might have prevented the problem, but nonetheless, it happened. More careful observation might be warranted."
5,Saturated Grooves,"I came across this album accidently and found myself completely overtaken by the rich layered musical textures and complex vocal arrangements. I wondered to myself, where has this Sabrina Judge been? She is so in command of her material. Her poetic lyrics describe more than just the usual rock/rap/'young woman in rock' confessional style song. It's a mix of Leonard Cohen and Patty Smith. Hard-soft-ironic-spiritual(?). And then the groove. It is just so wonderful to encounter something so smart, so layered, and yet so hip-swayingly good."
1,And the point is?,"This CD-ROM consists of Adobe Acrobat files. It is a compilation of publicly available web pages that contain information about US Navy submarines and the submarine force. As far as I can tell, you could just as easily find the same material on the web with a decent search engine. For example, the CD contains the issues of Undersea Warfare magazine, which is readily available from a Navy public website. Many of the graphics are extremely blocky and unreadable. The web pages are largely DOD server downloads of public material, and are verbatim, right down to the warnings. A surprising number of pages are just `spillovers"" from the bottom of a web page, and contain no information. Clearly, almost no editing of the material was attempted when transferring to the disc. If you use the disc while online, you can click on the hyperlinks and they will take you to more information. Not worth the money."
4,An intuitive approach with good real world examples.,An excellent review of the basic foundations of statistics with business applications. Does not contain the reams of computer output common in other texts. Nice real world examples. An intuitive approach with only moderate reliance on formulae. Good for classroom use or as a reference book for the business professional.
2,Difficult to set,"I bought this watch for my son, who is almost 12. It is nearly impossible to set it...the instructions are VERY difficult to understand, and virtually worthless. I even took it to get a new battery and the guy told me it was one of the most diffcult watches to program he had ever seen. A cool watch...but needs to be much easier to use, especially as it is aimed at kids."
5,Book about evil,"This book is a rare glimpse at Croatian Army and its tasks during II World War. Being more ruthless than Germans themselves, Croatian ustashe did the most evil things ever done in human history...They did not only execute almost one million Serbs and Jews in Jasenovac, but they tortured them in ways never seen or heard before...Their evil deeds were almost always done in ""the name of Christ"" and with generous support of Vatican and catholic clergy. Even today an usual Croatian greeting is ""Croatia and God!"" In the name of their God (it can't be same God that rest of us believe in), they massacred millions in Balkans. Their torture techniques were even disgusting to Hitler's generals, who branded them as ""savages""! This book is a testament to those days, when evil ruled the World and Croatian army was its most brutal ally...Do not miss it!"
2,Not bad .....but not great!,"The book is logically organized and quite easy to read. However, DO NOT rely on this text as your only source of information as it does NOT cover all the material (probably about 70-80%). Also the main author is Jason Couchman - not Schwinn, and there are quite a few typos and technical errors both in the text and the test questions."
2,"Good overview, but don't rely on it","As overview, it is usefull. Compared with the exams, I found it covers about 70% of the material and has quite a few typo's and errors. The network part is CD only (bad). I suggest the Oracle DBA Certification Kit or the Exam Cram Books ... and a bit of practice."
3,Oracle 8i DBA preparation,"I found several errors in this book. Only if you are actually doing the examples you will realize that some of them are misleading. It seems like simple typographical errors, but for a beginner very dangerous."
2,Misleading and confusing,"This book contains a lot of mistakes. Many incorrect examples and information are wrong too! If you are a beginner, you will be misled by it. I will not recommend you to study this book if you would like to pass the OCP exam."
2,Good book spoilt by lots of errors and contradictions,Been an Oracle DBA for about 7 years. This book has many basic errors and contradictions as did the version 7 guide. Its a real shame as it will mislead and confuse people who will then probably fail their exams. Emailed Couchman both times but with no reply until recently when anyone who has every emailed him got an email which started a spam war due to his inability to use BCC. Not worth the money. Amazed Oracle would put their name to this - they should at least get the books checked.
4,This book helped me certify.,"I have passed all five exams for Oracle 8i OCP certification in Database Administration. My only study resources were this Exam Guide, Couchman's Practice Exams text and Oracle's own documentation (which is now available via the internet). I feel I learned a tremendous amount from this book, not only helping me pass the exams, but enhancing my career skills as well.I found this book was extremely useful, especially the PL/SQL, Admin and Architecture, and Backup/Recovery sections. For the Tuning and Networking exams I relied more on the Oracle documentation. This book gives an excellent overview of what is covered on the exams and Oracle's documentation helps fill in the gaps. I recommend this book to DBA's with some experience who wish to become certified."
2,Misled by this site.,"I received the book today and returning it now. On this web site, the authors are listed as: Ulrike Schwinn, Jason S. Couchman, and Jeremy Judson. But the real authors are: Jason S. Couchman, Ulrike Schwinn.The book looks not so bad. But it's so wordy that there is no room for the Unit V in all these 1156 pages...it goes to the CD. Even the smaller font won't help it.I'm quite unhappy about the misleading. Therefore, a two star."
5,"Product good, return support terrible","I purchased 4 of the wrong model the first time. I contacted support and they were helpful in replacing with the correct model and issuing a RMA. However, I returned the incorrect ones on Jan. 16 (signature from UPS to verify) and still have not received the credit. You cannot talk to support on phone - only send email which to this point has gone unanswered."
5,Una novela linda,"En muy pocas páginas, Pacheco nos cuenta la historia de México en los años 50 por los ojos de Carlos, un hombre quién está recordando su adolesencia en la Colonia Roma, D.F. En este bildungsroman, encontramos de nuevo el primer amor y la entrada al mundo adulto, un mundo en que uno se lucha contra la perdición."
5,Heaven on earth!,"What a class artist Charlie Zaa is and this album Puro Sentimiento will definitely win the hearts of sentimental bolero fans. This is only the second album I own by this artist and again Charlie Zaa has out done himself with his unique music style which inludes the melodic sound of the requinto and the guitar. The lyrics, acoustics and melody are supreme on this album. No skipping tracks on this one."
3,Got the stuff I needed for my collection,"Their best stuff back in the day. Not a bad album, after all. However, the later stuff leaves a lot to be desired."
5,The Foundations of Rock 'n Roll are ALL Right Here,"This is just a sampling but what an amazing sampling and checkmark of the greatest precursor rock 'n roll tracks from Muddy waters, Sonny Boy & Howlin' Wolf - then add in the guy who bridged it all - Chuck Berry though the quasi-forgotten Bo Diddley who can make an amazing case of why he should be right up there with Berry. Of course, there are only about 25 tracks so it's certainly not complete but it's a great roundup with OUTSTANDING sound quality - for beginning collectors, you get 3-5 of the 10 most influencial blues tracks, you get a handful of the most important Berry & Bo Diddley tracks and a sprinkling of killer and killer and great cuts where you can still hear the influences today - and for long time collectors, if you want one CD to throw in the car - hard to go wrong with this one. Perfect choices. Excellent sound quality. Get it!"
4,Down my alley,"The other reviewers hit the nail on the head. This guy wails! I don't like this as much as his other albums, but it's still great. ""It's Only Time is the #1 CD in my collection. I love it. His emotive delivery is inspiring, and his music is refreshing as well as powerful. The fusion of different sounds (rock, punk, blues, county) produces a style that has the edge of the Violent Femmes, the soul of John Mellencamp and the emotion of Melissa Etheridge, yet totally unique. BUY THIS MAN'S MUSIC! I want him to make enough money to keep producing more."
5,A gifted singer/songwriter who deserves notice,Mark Curry is a rarity in this day and age of mediocrity in music. He is a gifted singer with a rare style that is easily recognizable and a gifted songwriter who writes from the heart. I was given his first album and was amazed at the sincerity in his delivery of his songs. With this album he does not disapoint. A talent that needs to be heard. If you want to hear a unique musician you should buy this album. The album has a variety of songs that show the range of Mr. Curry's talent. The record is worth owning to hear the amazing way that Mr. Curry uses his voice. Try and imitate his skat-like style. I've never met anyone who can.
4,a great party album,"this is a wonderful mix of rock, blues, folk, given kind of a punk feel. though the general idea of the cd seems to be wondering, it still holds together well. maybe not a must have, but a definate must borrow."
1,China 9 Liberty 37/Gone With the West,"THIS DVD WAS AWFUL. PARTS OF THE MOVIES WERE MISSING. THE PICTURES WAS BLURRED, SOUNDS WERE AWFUL, VERY POOR MADE MOVIE. SELLERS SHOULD NOT SELL DVDS OR MOVIES WHEN THEY ARE THIS BAD, ITS A RIP OFF."
5,Honky tonk at its best,"There's a lot of different George Jones's in his career, but the one in this collection is all honky tonk. These are the best tracks from his Mercury and Starday sides and is the first compilation to venture into this territory. Most of this was included later in the 1994 collection ""Cup of Lonliness"", but listening straight through from 1-20 on this CD is a stark reminder that once upon a time, George Jones could honky tonk with the best of them. He may be the best voice ever recorded in country music, but these sides are his truest legacy."
5,helpful workbook for children and parents,"this is a great book. there are many practive exercises to help kids prepare for these new tests, and they are fun to do, with explanations. good information on how the test is structured. definitely helpful!"
4,Breath in Silk,Personally could have used a bit more room in the 2X hence the 4 out of 5.The color and feel of the shorts are very nice. Silk is great and at a good price.
5,So You Want To Be A Game Programmer?,"Andre Lamothe easily stands out as one of the most well written programming authors in the business, and for those of us that actually want to learn how to blit sprites to a screen or manipulate 3d space, Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus and Tricks of the Windows 3D Game Programming Gurus are required reading. And not only required, but fun and inspiring. These books are more a Compendium of game design methodologies than tricks, so expect to learn ALOT of useful information that you can apply. My only nag was the absence of workspaces from the cd in this version, but that's easily overlooked when you see the size of this book, and the sheer quantity of knowledge it contains. Lamothe is a master, and gives his readers everything he has-the result is excellence."
1,Very chaotic package of articles,"The whole book looks like a chaotic package of articles. Some of them are too long, some are too short. There is no path, that leads you through the book. The author constantly tells you how great he is. The visual appearance of the example programs is not very pleasant. The performance of the examples is very low. You won't be able to use this engine in a real-world application."
2,too much contents with little highlight,"writer talk about too much basic knowledges which are used for 3d game programming , but most of them like knowledge of math and windows programming we can find in other books even in the course we studied long long ago.wish writer take the 3d as the point and talk more about the newest technolegies arised this years."
2,Lamothe is a 2nd rate programmer,"if you want to get confused by a trillion optimizations in the parts where understanding is the most important, by all means get this book.Lamothe is still stuck in the mid-70's C days. He claims C++ is ""hard to teach in"" because it is confusing. I think it is more confusing to him than to any modern programmer. Old C is by far more confusing in my opinion.This book is 1700 pages long - a big chunk of it is almost pure code dump, that could easily fit on a CD (and does). The old-fashioned programming style, combined with his optimizations down to the assembler level makes the code hard to understand. I believe it is time for Lamothe to enter the 21st century with his programming style, and get out of the 70's."
3,A Top-Notch reference!,"Well, let me explain my 3. The book is great and I love LaMothe's writing style. I'm also more a mathmatician than I am a programmer so I really enjoyed almost all of it (most 3D Books tell you how to program something without you having a clue what it's doing, very frustrating). All in all it's a really good book.Though it lacks compared to TOTWGPG in that, it skips out completely on implementation in hardware, which was frustrating since finding a good source of cohearsing DirectX to do what you want is hard to come by, especially in this ""Managed"" day-and-age.Anyway, in short, great for understanding the math for some beginner to advanced techniques, but definetely not the only one to have on your shelf if you actually plan to program anything."
5,"If one, this one !!","They are not so many people who know deeply what they are talking about and definitely André LaMothe is one of them.This book is well writen with all technical data needed in order to write a 3D engine.The author presents all the necessary math but not more.For me, this book is suitable for beginners to advanced programmers.Also its price is really cheap comparatively to its size and mainly all the precious information contained in it.If you want to understand how a 3D engine is built (for exeample DirectX) this book is actually the best for you."
4,Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Fire,"Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Fire - While traveling through the countryside Kyoshiro is forced to defend himself against an angry samurai trying to kill an apparently innocent woman. He is soon to find out that the woman is far from innocent and he unwittingly becomes ensnared in a convoluted plot kill off a band of smugglers that have been siphoning off loot from the shogun's treasury and giving it to one of the local (and very corrupt) officials. True to form, Kyoshiro sides with the underdogs and uses his blade to make things right. The sword battles in this film are very good and Kyoshiro dispenses his dark humor with the same flair as he wields his blade. As with the other films in this series, the camerawork and widescreen format are a treat and the acting and overall production values make this one a joy to watch. Oh yes, Kyoshiro takes special care of the ""innocent"" woman from the start of the film."
5,Great Book!,"If I were ever to be stranded in the jungle.....this is the book I want with me. Great, practical information."
5,Good deal,"This book is very useful, it 's not possible to find it in library for sale. it was a good deal to buy sheap at Amazon.Ahmed"
5,Excellent!!,"I've been looking for this for years. I've often looked for used copies here on Amazon or ebay, and I'm glad I never shelled out $40 or more for it in either of those places. IT IS ON ITUNES FOR $9.99. And it's the complete double album too. Enjoy!"
5,Beyond Superb,"I'm completely speechless. I'm a major Morrison fan and I thought that I'd heard it all and his body of work is so large, until I have not heard all of it, but I was completely floored by this one. Every single track is a classic and he makes the standard, I Can't Stop Loving You, his own. But, let's see: How do you compare the stars in the sky? Well, let's see: There's Village Idiot, which I played ten times in a row. What a wonderful song. Then, there's Professional Jealousy, I'm Not Feeling It Anymore, another ten timer, Take Me Back, I Need Your Kind Of Loving, Hell, just everything!!!! For those of us lucky enough to own it, what joy it brings. For those of you who do not, GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!Stunning work!!!!"
1,had to return item,"I had to return the item because there was only one CD of a two CD package. ""Hymns to the Silence"" has been a two CD package since its release, and the price of it was over $40.00; why would anyone think that only half of the double CD would arrive without half the tunes included, especially at that price?! I did receive a full refund and I am happy about that, but that was disappointing. I will probably not be buying anything through Amazon in the future.Elizabeth Lindsey"
5,merrily we live dvd,"I was very surprised by the quality of the dvd, very clean. Great movie that is very funny for an old movie. Saw the movie on tv and had to have it in my collection. Excellent seller and very fast shipping! Thanks for the great movie."
3,BLURRY COPY,"This copy has a blurry focus,as if you were looking through slightly oil smeared eye glasses. The sound quality is just fine, typical for this era. It is a lighthearted comedy/romance, with a fun cast, & the overall production of this film is good enough that I am willing to give it a 3 star rating.If you are a collector, I would still buy this version, at least until a properly re-mastered version is available.That being said,(you really have to be a fan of these actors, and this type of story), it is easy to get involved enough that the focus problem becomes unimportant as the story progresses.Typical 1930's screwball sometimes compared to My Man Godfrey, probably because the general story has to do with a supposed tramp (Brian Aherne), going to live in a very wealthy household, full of nit-wit family members including Constance Bennett & Billie Burke."
2,The factory packaging is an outrage,"Anyone with a right mind that spends over $300.00 for a product and see's how the factory packages this by all rights should be enraged. If there is 3 cents worth of plastic in the factory package I would be surprised. This is an outrage. That alone would be cause enough for me to send it back, however the limp plastic had melted and warped the cover and this cases. If you are expecting $300.00 worth of CD casing to protect the disks, forget it. I sent it back.FOLLOW UP:I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to amazon for refunding this purchase. Thank you very much! 5 stars to amazon customer service."
1,Not worth the money,"This set cost enough and yet the cheap plastic the discs are in didn't hold up in shipping. I couldn't believe that I was looking at some taped together disc ""trays"", for want of a better word, that fit badly into this box-like thing (it's not even a complete box, for pete's sake). Plus no episode guide and the quality of the image on screen is not impressive. There really isn't anything in this set that makes it worth my hard earned money!"
4,Becareful what you buy...,"This set you see here from Amazon is the Authentic Anniversary Collection set from Paramount. The set called the ""Chosen Collection"" is bootleg. I am bringing this up because someone posted the pictures of the ""Chosen Collection"" next to the authentic set. Be careful of fakes.I am happy with the Authentic Anniversary Collection set from Paramount.I am glad I have the entire series."
3,"Its OK,,,not great",Should have been released in Blu Ray rather than low rez television. Rather disappointing actually. But its better than nothing
4,Compact size for a full series,"This product provides very compact packaging for the complete Next Generation series. If you're short on space, this is a good idea. However, there is unfortunately no guide list for what episodes can be found on each disc. This was an anniversary gift for my parents, who have always been big Star Trek fans. This was to replace the dozens of taped episodes they have been holding onto. They have really been enjoying the episodes. Great gift idea!"
1,Absolutely the worst.,"The packaging for this set is the cheapest of the cheap, but what was even worse is that the discs don't play. I had to get a refund from Amazon because the seller ignored my emails for a refund. Do not buy from this seller!"
1,Disappointing.,"Upon arrival, the set seemed perfect- Great display case, hours of Star Trek- The perfect gift for my best friend. Unfortunatly, the set I got her was not all star trek- the thrid disc starts playing the first episode and then all of a sudden... it switches to an episode of NCIS! Needless to say, this is one of the most dissappointing items I've ever purchased online. :( Although, in all fairness to Amazon, the copy I selected was from another user. Neverthe less, it was a huge let down to know that I spent so much on a bootleg."
2,I Feel Fortunate,I am one of the lucky ones who bought the individual seasons early on. Mine came fromColumbia House. The packaging is extremely well-done and should hold up well for yearsto come. Very slick. And the video quality couldn't be better. I don't see these aroundany longer. Sorry for the newcomers. Have hope tho'. Perhaps some generous soul(s) willbe willing to part with their copies altho for Heaven only knows what reason !
3,Star Trek Next Generation complete set,"The contents are wonderful - stng is probably the best series ever to be broadcast on TVUnfortunately I purchased the complete set used - ""as good as new"". The first disc (of 49) is almost unusable (cracks, skips, misses portions). The second disc is slightly better and the third is marginally better than the second. I should know better than purchased used dvds. Let the buyer beware"
2,Damaged Goods,"I am not very happy about this product - the seller stated that while the packaging had been damaged, the Dvds were in good shape - that was not true at all. There were at least 4 dvds just in the first season group that could not be viewed."
4,star trek the next generation- complete series,The product arrived in very good time. However the storage case is made of thin hard plastic and shattered in a few places. It may have been due to the cold weather during shipping.
