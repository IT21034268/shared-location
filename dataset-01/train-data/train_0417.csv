1,did not work,"Purchased because was blue tooth compatible with headsets. Unfortunately, this did not prove to be the case and item has been returned."
1,Difficult To Use,"Frustration. That is how I would describe the use of this tuner. I am a novice and I find it almost impossible to use. The note indicator lights jump all over the place and I find it very difficult to tune a guitar with it. When I take the tuner out to the piano, the lights lock in on the notes as I play it, but when I try to tune the guitar it seems like it picks up harmonics and won't lock in on the notes."
1,FENDER SPARKLE TONE AUTO TUNER,"DON'T KNOW, I SENT IT TO MY DAUGHTER BY MISTAKE. WHEN I GET IT BACK I'LL LET YOU KNOW....."
1,Breaks very easily!,"This pan set was immediately dented by normal play and the handle on one came off. I am shocked by the lack of quality. From the brand and price, I expected so much more. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought they were from a dollar store. Very disappointing."
2,Pan ruined first day played with,I would not recommend this set. We have a wooden set that is very durable. This set is ruined after one day of play. The metal is flimsy and my son bent the frying pan so that it is unusable now. And he's only 2 and doesn't play that roughly. Very expensive for something destroyed so easily!
1,terrible quality,the metal feels very cheap and within the first hour of playing had shown noticeable denting. plan toys would be better served by charging a few dollars extra to use a heavier gauge steel as this product is not consistent with their otherwise stellar offering.
3,Toy Pans,"These look very cute but the bottom of the pans are a little flimsy, they're both bent up now. But they look really cute with my daughters retro kitchen."
2,Cute but not that durable...,"These pots are a good size for children but the metal is very thin and dents easily. Also the handle for the frying pan is too heavy for the metal of the pan that the pan does stay flat. We found much better, real stainless steal pots and pans at IKEA for much less money. Although my children play with them, I wouldn't make this purchase again because of the quality issue.It's the one PLAN toy that has really disappointed us..."
2,NOT DURABLE,"I just saw this toy at my friend's hose. Well, as much as we love Plan Toys, this one is NOT durable whatsoever. The little pot had dents all over. It looked like something you get for 50 cents... I will definitely NOT but this one for my child. Sorry, Plan Toys, but this time we are going with a different brand."
3,Cute little set,"This is a cute, basic set for our son's playkitchen. I like that it came with a lid that fits 2/3 pots and that it came with two wooden utensils. These seem like very sturdy pieces that will last awhile."
4,He's Back......,"Somehow Mr. Deveney has taken the old subject of Jack The Ripper and breathed new life into it. This is not a story where we know who did it and follow along with those who don't until they find out. This is a true suspenseful mystery that keeps you guessing with every turn of the page. For anyone who enjoys a true mystery, you will enjoy the way this new author shows how he masterfully takes you to the edge of your seat,....then yanks it out from under you, and leaves you Chasing Shadows."
3,forced into buying,"Be sure that the mop refills you are buying are correct, as amazon did not allow me to return these. So I had to buy the mop in addition for these to be useful. I thought that was a little cheesy.The mop works fine - it is a mop. With a slightly bigger sponge."
2,not satisfied,i bought this mop to use it with floor renewer bit its not helpful at all it makes the floor full of linesvery disappointing
1,another flop,I was so happy when I found this mop. Little did I know that this was just another flop mop. I broke the mop the first time is was used. Push down on the sponge and watch it crack in half. Give me the old fashion type
3,cannot squeeze,I have spent an hour trying to wring out sponge with yellow plastic head. No movement. Very frustrating. Please advise.Revised view / excellent product once realized the downward push would not break plastic
5,Handy mop,"I had a cleaning busyness for a while & these mops are great, but not easy to find in the chicago area. Get's in tight areas. Little red scrubing pad is very handy."
3,"Reviews had my hopes high but, like all modern mops, this mop left me disappointed","I feel fooled by the pictures and description of this mop. I have been looking for a well built mop that holds the sponge properly and this mop does not deliver.Instead of a solid threaded wing-nut design on the mop head to mount the sponge, I realized this mop has been built as cheaply as the rest. The plastic nubs connect via plastic nuts which lock in place with a quarter turn. Under normal mopping these cheap nuts rotate and release leaving the mop sponge flopping loose. Manufacturer saved cents and built a disappointing mop as a result."
5,Quickie mop,What can I say this is the perfect mop. It picks up dirt the other mops just don't. The design is perfect and I really like using it.
2,Cheap Plastic,"Standard, cheap, flimsy, plastic, walmart style mop. Nothing professional about this product at all. Standard plastic chinese made dollar store mop."
4,25th Anniversary,"""The Cathedral Quartet 25th Anniversary"" This is a good gospel albumn. I recommend it to all fans of good gospel music."
5,Great deal,This a great product at a good price with a fast delivery. It is very tough and durable and is just the right size. This is not my first of these and likely wont be my last.
4,T-Fal 1769 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron,"For the most part, I like this iron very much. It's comfortable in my hand while ironing, the fill feature is well designed, and it performs beautifully overall. The only negative is the cord. It is positioned oddly and takes getting used to when putting the iron in the idle, stand-up position. It's stiff and points downward, requiring a little attention when standing the iron on it's heel. But, if I needed another new iron tomorrow, it's still the one I would buy."
5,A big step up,"This iron is a big step up from standard irons my wife and I have been using. It is light, glides smoothly, has a variety of convenient settings, and has a longer than average cord. Well worth a few extra dollars over standard irons."
3,Still Spits,This is the 3rd Steem Iron I have purchased in 2 months. Every Iron has damage clothing at one time or another. I went out of my way this time to buy a 'top rated' self cleaning Iron to stop the $$$ of replacing clothes that get hit with water or sudden spits of deposits. This one also randomly dumps a spit or spill of steam out when lifted off. On a nice white shirt it can mean it goes right into the wash even though I've used nothing but distilled water. The other top rated Iron actually dumps water randomly. To top things off this one doesn't even have a retractable cored so it's cumberson. What ever happened to simple reliable Irons that put out steam only when you wanted them? This particular Iron is no better or worse than a $30 Iron from Kmart.
5,Great Iron,"I am so pleased with how well this iron works. I have the 1580 model and love the fact that it is light weight, making it easy on the wrist and arm. The water reservoir is huge, fills easily, doesn't leak and there is plenty of steam. The steam works in the vertical position also. The heat is hot enough to take out wrinkles from heavy cotton items and works very well with silk. It doesn't shut off while I am using it and when idle will turn on easily with a quick movement. My last iron was a Black and Decker and was very heavy, didn't hold a lot of water so I had to refill often, it leaked, it shut off while I was using it and it stained my clothes. The T-Fal has done none of these things. I am happy with my purchase."
2,Returned,"I have had several T Fal irons over the years and never had a problem. This one though I returned after two weeks. It took a long time to heat up.. spurted water all the time with the steam burst and the slide would get caught and not move up to the cotton.. I am not sure if this model has had quality issues, but i really like their irons just not this one."
1,Not as good,"This iron has a great marketing advertisement but the performance of it falls short. The ""Ultraglide"" is something that can only be experienced when the iron is clean and nothing sticks to it. I have never had to buy any hot iron cleaner until I bought this iron. The sliding heat dialer broke right after I bought it and not it is stuck to only hot and very hot. The steam button does not recoil back to its position either so it cannot be used. Auto shut-off does work though but that is the only consistent feature.Not worth the money!"
5,Very Pleased,"Very pleased with this iron. Functional, practical and no problems with it. It does not ""spit"" like other irons I have had in the past."
2,Temp setting,"I really like this iron, it glides very smoothly. The temp setting broke with a few weeks. I know I could have sent it in for a warranty repair, but I decide not to bother."
3,Worked great before it died,"I *loved* this iron when I first bought it, and I recommended it to everyone I knew. But then, one day, it just died. It's as if the auto-turn-off decided to permanently stay off. The iron lights up when plugged in, but it never heats up. It's too bad because it was a really good iron while it lasted."
1,I threw it out after using it 5 or 6 times,"I agree with all the positive comments about this iron. Did a great job of ironing, glides, etc., etc. Only problem is the soleplate got dirty, from plastic thread or whatever, I do not know. I cleaned it, used it again and after a few minutes it was dirty again. This kept happening and I just could NOT keep it clean. Finally I just took it and threw it in the dumpster. I have never had this problem with any iron before or with the one I bought to replace it."
2,Works great then dies.,"I purchased this on Mar. 6, 2006. It lasted exactly 10 months then died. Apparently the switch linkage broke inside the iron. The control slides very loosely and it no longer gets hot. Ha: I just threw out the box it came in. Should have saved it to send back to the President of T-Fal. It was nice while it lasted, but it will be a long, long time before I buy any T-Fal. Why does a toaster oven last 30 years while irons die so young? It's still within warranty so I will be sending it back. T-Fal sucks."
1,I can't like it!,"I purchased this in Jan 06 - here it is May 11. 06. I have to return it to manufacture for replacement, the iron has auto shut off now it will not shut off!. You know that feeling when you leave on vacation and forgot to turn the iron off well........... it could be true.I do not want another auto-shut-off to scary."
3,T-Fal 1769,"I purchased this iron because I previously had a T-Fal iron that gave me really good services, and was easy to use. I guess there is a learning curve with anything new, but I was somewhat disappointed with this iron. The sliding temperature control under the handle is difficult to see and clumsy to use. My old one had an indicator to show me how much steam to use with the various temperatures. This one does not give me that information. In addition, it appears to not get as hot at the hottest setting as my old iron did. Given a second choice, I would definitely choose a different iron."
5,Excellent Iron,"This is an excellent iron. It heats up up quickly, the soleplate glides very easily over all types of fabric, there are lots of steam holes, including several at the front tip, the cord is longer than found on many irons nowdays and the buttplate is large enough to stand the iron securely without having to use a separate stand, as is the case with many irons today. We've used many irons over the years and this T-Fal 1769 ranks with the very best of them."
4,"Excellent iron, if you're just ironing.","This is a great iron, if your simply using it to iron your clothes. Easy UI, powerful and steady steam and nice, pointy triangle work surface. However, if you're using this iron along side of the sewing machine, then it shuts itself off every few minutes (as a safety feature), and it becomes really annoying, as it has no feature to disable this auto shut-off. So you'll step away from the iron just for a few minutes to sew, only to realize you have turn it back on again, almost everytime you use it."
4,awesome phone,"I have only had the phone a month so far, so I cant rate long range use--but so far we love this phone. It works great and is super easy to use. I love that you can record your own ringtone, we have one set for our most regular callers and can then tell if we want to answer the phone or not. All of our friends who have heard the phone do this, think it is so cool. I don't really have any complaints other than I wish it was shock and splash resistant like the other model we have but I guess you cant have everything....overall a great phone."
1,It is a blatant copy of the Kybalion by the Three Initates,This book is a blatant copy of Kybalion by Three Initiates. Some of the sentences are exact copies word by word.
1,Much Similarities to the Kybalion,"Readers of ""The Kybalion"" will realize that there is much common between the two, for example, the arrangement of topics and topics discussed. ""The Kybalion"" was published much earlier (around 1920 by Yogi Publication Society). Today, ""The Kybalion"" is printed by a couple of publishers (probably it has become ""freeware"", due to copyright not renewed...). Both books are about seven Hermetic principles (you can find out more by reading the reviews about ""The Kybalion"").Difference between the two is that this one aims to sound more ""mystical"" and complete, when in fact it is ""The Kybalion"" that is a true, earlier published work. It also tries to be more complete by mentioning the creation of the universe, etc.""Summum: Sealed, Except to the Open Mind"" is now available as freeware and can be found at (...). The impression I got after reading is that it is just to lead people to a website to buy dubious goods.Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Nice when it works.,"I'm in complete agreement with the customer that posted a review on 12/12/2003. The reason I bought this watch was for the ""self-setting"" feature. I live about 20 miles north of the city of Chicago. I also only get a good signal about once a month. I have also tried to get a signal in Milwaukee, Denver, and Las Vegas with no luck. Basically, if you take away the self-setting feature there is really nothing on this watch that you can't get for much less money.Oh, and I also agree with the customer that talked about the scratches on the crystal. I've never had a watch that scratched so easily."
2,"Nice concept, but...","Overall I wanted to like this watch, but after 6 months the plastic crystal has accumulated so many scratches it looks much older than it is. Just look at it sideways and it picks up another scratch. The features are great, and the atomic precision is very nice, but the crystal is cheap and a poor design. I'd love to see all these features in a decent quality package, till then I'm wearing my Skagen."
1,do not get it wet,"the first time i went swimming(not diving),water got into the watch. it's so fogged-up,i can't read the time."
3,Cheap wrist band,"I bought this watch July 2004 and after a year and a half, the strap broke. I like this watch so instead of having the band replaced which would cost me almost half the price, I bought another one of exactly the same model. That was Dec 2005. Now, it is July 2007 and the strap of the second watch broke again. I like this watch, but I decided not to buy another one. Once - is a mistake. Twice, is foolishness. Now, I have 2 watches, both still working but I can not wear them."
4,Love my Casio Waveceptor!,"I am very happy with my Waveceptor, which I purchased a year ago. It synchs every morning at 4 or 5. I point it toward Colorado and put it on a windowsill when I'm in a hotel or other steel building; in my house in Maryland, it works great! I love knowing that I have the exact time. The alarm and night light work great. I traveled to Europe for two weeks and it did not recognize the European signals, but when I returned it was still in perfect time. My crystal has no scratches. None. Maybe Casio has improved the crystal?"
5,"It is nice to know I am ""normal""","This book was a bit clinical for the first chapter or two, but then it became very personal and on a human level. Books where one can go ""oh that is me"" are such a surprise, especially when you begin reading it thinking this will not help because nothing can help me. The book comes across loving and non-judgemental. My guess would be that most people reading these sorts of books really did not go looking for an extra-marital affair either physically or emotionally and are taken back when it does occur. Happy reading."
1,Now it's our turn?,"After reading this book, I came away thinking it was meant totally as a rationalization for women who have had, or are having, affairs. It read to me, the husband of one of these women, as though Dr. Friedman was doing her best to say that since men have been doing this for years, now it's the women's turn. There were all kinds of reasons given for these affairs, but scant little was said about the damage they do, to family, friends, and even co-workers, of ALL the parties involved. The most common excuse given, the ""I wasn't looking for it"" just doesn't wash. Are affairs common in our society? Of course they are. But this book tries to legitimize something that is harmful from the get-go."
2,Mediocre in every sense of the word,"Extremely disappointed in this one. I found the sound quality to be only marginally better than what I had on my existing 45's. The packaging is ugly and the feeble attempt at liner notes is an embarrassment. As another reviewer has already noted, they even managed to get the title on cut #16 wrong. How in the world does that happen? The correct title should be ""Get On Up"" by the Esquires. Only redeeming features on this one is that there are 26 cuts including a couple of tunes that are extremely hard to locate. I had not heard nor have I ever seen Jimmy Castors ""Hey Leroy"" since it charted back in '67. Other hard to find tunes include the aforementioned ""Get On Up"", Kenny O'Dells ""Beautiful People"" as well as the Hombres ""Let It All Hang Out"". Unless there are a bunch of songs you are really looking for on this disc I would skip this one for sure."
2,Just Average CD,"I too was slightly disappointed in this CD, although it did contain 7 tracks that I did not previously have. My copy also had ""Get on Up"" by The Esquires instead of their follow-up ""And Get Away."" Also, there was audio damage which sounded like static all through the last track, ""I Can't Help it If I'm Still in Love With You"" by B. J. Thomas. But, I did get a few hard to find tracks, which, like the other reviewer says, is all you would want to buy this for.PS - ""Get on Up"" is listed as a track on Volume 1, which I also ordered and which hasn't yet arrived. Maybe it is ""And Get Away""???"
1,Not the best quality,After using it two times to scrub the floor in front of my unit there is no much brush left except for a piece of wood
3,Brilliant here and there...mostly just okay,"This book was only a little over 200 pages; thus, I thought I would finish it in one day. It took me a little over a week. I would read some and then put it aside. The premise of the book held promise. A handyman on an estate inhabited by an ancient woman finds an abandoned baby. He turns into a wonderful father, and the old woman seems to have found new life. But, alas, all for naught because the old woman doesn't trust him after all. While the robbery seemed contrived to me, there had to be some way to end this. Given the brevity of the novel, apparently Anna thought the same thing. The last fifty pages were the best. Once again, Anna did show her ability for fine writing, but the characters were a bit one-dimensional. I would have like to have explored them a bit more in depth."
3,Not much of a blessing.,"Maybe it's just some personality defect on my part, but Anna Quindlen kind of bugs me. I never got into her columns, and I wasn't crazy about her novel, ""Black and Blue."" And anyone who has the chutzpah to publish a book of ""life secrets"" that's only 64 pages -- and to charge $12.95 for it -- is someone I don't want to know very well.That said, I thought ""Blessings"" was an okay book. Not terrific, but worth a read if you're 3,000 miles from home and don't have a lot of other choices (which was my circumstance). Was I in love with it? Put it this way -- after I finished it, I left it in the hotel room."
3,"Sweet, tender and moving","This is the first Anna Quindlen book I've every read. The only other writing of hers I have to compare this to is her feature articles in Newsweek and I'd have to say that those articles and this book are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Though both being very well written and thought out.I did enjoy this novel while I was reading it. I liked the story, the characters and the writing. I didn't care for the ending which doesn't mean that it wasn't very well done, it was. It just wasn't satisfying to me, it wasn't the way I wanted it to end.I thought it was a good book worthy of reading, it wasn't disappointing it just wasn't one of the greatest books I've ever read."
2,Definitely a Skimmer,"The description of the book emphasized the plot, but its contents barely touched on the plot. It seemed to me that the actual purpose of the book was to detail the personality and background of some of its characters. It had a plot which seemed interesting at the outset but the author constantly jumped from the plot to reminiscing about the past. Its continuity got lost so many times that I wonder why I would read another book by the same author."
3,I Found This A Bit Unrealistic!!!,"I was hoping this book would be worth 5 stars,but then I read it. I was disappointed. I have so many questions.Maybe they were there, and I overlooked them. Like, what statewas Blessings in? How old was Skip? Who was Lydia's former husband?The sentences often confused meIt seemed like two stories going at once. The baby in the box, and a woman and her memories. It seemed very unrealitic that he would take her without telling anyone about it. I would have liked to see him give Lydia more of a role in the baby's upbringing. He was made to look very stingy. How did he think he could live a full life with that much of a responsibility.Because of a decent ending, I give this book threestars."
4,keeps ur attention,"I haven't completely finished but so far it's got my attention. The characters seem so real and their emotions intrigue me. Other than this book, I also recommend ""Next Time Around"" by Kristina Bailey."
3,WHY NOT ME?,"Do you often wonder why some books get published and make it to the best seller list and others get trashed on the reject pile? This is one of those books that depending on who reads it ,is either wonderful or not worth the paper it was printed on. I am a writter ( non published to date) and feel that this book was at best a beginner novel, which of course it is not. I fell asleep each time I picked it up and was glad when I turned the last page."
4,handy-man turned mom,"This is the story of Lydia Blessing, her resident handy-man, Skip, and the baby he finds at his front door one morning. The story is about how Skip falls in love with the mystery baby and how the two of them soften the old routine-loving Mrs. Blessing. The basic story is good, but a great deal of the book explores the pasts of both Lydia and Skip in a way that is very disrupting to the telling of the main story. Sometimes the flasback is only a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages, but the transitions between past and present are not smooth and sometimes random. I was halfway through the book before I figured out who all these people from the past were and how they relate to the characters. Still, it's a pretty good book, and even though it doesn't have the greatest ending, it's still enjoyable enough."
3,Too Much Narrative,"As usual, Anna's Quindlen's writing was nothing short of superb. Whenever I read her work, I'm in awe at her vivid descriptions, the perfection of each sentence, and the way each sentence flows into the next. She is a highly skilled and talented writer. However, there were way too many info dumps in this novel. I found myself skimming over large sections of narrative that weren't important to the story. These chunks of narrative slowed the pace of the story to a near stand still and lent the reader boredom. I would recommend this book only to someone who is a Quindlen fan or who has the patience for a long winded tale."
5,Veering off the path,This book is richly written. It is about the joy of heading off in a new unexpected direction in life at any age and making cracks in the family and societal expectations and roles and life patterns that are hard to escape. Quindlen again captures the complexities of families and the redemption of acknowledging the family truths that are known consciously or sub-consciously anyway. Her writing places the reader at Blessing hearing the gurgling sounds and sharing the delights of watching the miracle of a baby growing. There is right and wrong but it is often found in the most unlikely place or character.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book with enthusiasm soon after it was published, afer having listened to Anna Quindlen discuss it on television. After the first couple of chapters, I would read a few pages, put it down, and couldn't bring myself to pick it back up. It was sheer boredom, but I forced myself to get through it. I did like Skip and baby Faith, but too much else was going on to maintain interest. The writing was okay, but the flashbacks became very distracting and the ending was disappointing."
1,Hopeless and sad,"I found this book quite depressing. I didn't mind the quick time-changes - where Lydia remembers something, and suddenly you're way back in time - but just as I thought Lydia was coming to life, and trusting and enjoying Skip and the baby, she ruins it. Skip is in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Lydia doesn't trust him. I found the book lacking in joy, and didn't really believe that the baby would be well cared for in the end."
1,Ladies' magazine fiction,"It amazed me that a writer who is published in a major, national magazine (Newsweek) could produce a novel so poorly written; the dialog and descriptions are graceless and the story cliched. However, if you can endure the tedium of the first half of the book, the story does get mildly interesting towards the end. Mildly.Come on, Anna. This isn't young adult fiction, is it?"
2,"Moments of Good writing, but problems in the storyline",I have a friend that I recommend books to all the time but I only recommend those that I feel are really outstanding. As a result she constantly raves about my book recommendations. This book is not one I will recommend to her.Although there are moments of brillant writing and potentially strong characters in the book the story line is so broken and potential plot lines left dangling that the books suffers as a whole. At the end of the book you find yourself disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good book try the Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood or Bel Canto by Ann Patchett.
1,curses,This book was boring and predictable. There wasn't one phrase or sentence I lingered over. If I didn't have to read it for my book club...I would have put it down about the third chapter.
3,Quindlen Has Written Better,"Regretfully, I have to agree with those reviewers who found this book boring. I too just couldn't get ""into"" it. I have read all of Ms. Quindlen's previous books and enjoyed them.I think the problem is in the way she bounces back and forth between the past and the present, sometimes within a single sentence. I think she was attempting to convey to the reader the way a person's mind really works - we may be listening to someone talk, but our mind is far away either in the past or the future. But in print this method simply renders the reader more confused that the narrator is supposed to be.Her descriptions were excellent. She uses a lot of detail and the reader really can ""see"" Blessings and all the assorted characters. I think this is what Quindlen is best at. The storyline, however, was a bit weak and implausable.Overall, I gave it a three because I felt that her writing is good enough to rescue the reader from the confusing time skips and rather uninspiring plot."
3,at least it didn['t end with a cliche,"but, that's about it...the story seems as though it were written by a less able writer, who made poor decisions about how and when to end the story or even why. I would have liked to have learned more about Mrs. Blessing's friend Jess, or her daughter, Meredith. Mrs. Blessing remained a rather shallow person, as evidenced by her quick reaction to judge Skip adversely. The book just seemed like it left some of the best parts of the story untold and wrapped it up much too quickly at the end(maybe Anna got tired of the story or was in a hurry to go on vacation!!!)"
2,Mediocre - at best,I was very disappointed in this book and in an author that I considered promising. It would seem that Anna Quinlen is on the Steele/Grisham program that encourages commercial success if a predictable template is followed. It will be interesting to see if Quindlen conforms to predictable plots and quick reads to satisfy an audience that savors mediocrity. I kept thinking there would be something redeeming if I just kept reading - I did and there wasn't.
2,Disappointing,"After reading the excerpt from the book in the September, 2002, issue of ""Reader's Digest,"" I was most anxious to read the entire book. Unfortunately, the book was disappointing. My appetite was whetted for more of the story of Skip and the baby. Instead, it dwelt mostly on the disfunctional family of Lydia. It was so entwined with Skip's story that it was confusing. Often both storylines--one of them a sequence of boring backflashes--were in one paragraph and I had to reread it more than once to avoid confusion. The only suspense involved was what would happen to the baby. How that was resolved was also disappointing."
3,Unhappy,This is my first book by Anna Quindlen and I'm not sure I will be thrilled to read anymore of her books. This book took me a long time to read (which means I wasn't on the edge of my seat!) The book started off great but then just seemed to keep me barely interested. Then the ending...I can't believe I read this to have it end so poorly. I hope other people don't waste there time as I did.
2,Would not reccommend,"I started the book several weeks ago, but I found the characters undefined and it could not hold my interest. I was disappointed after reading Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake. I just could not seem to dig my way through it and it did not leave me wanting to read the next page. So at this point, I would not reccommend it to others. Sorry."
3,Bittersweet,"I am a huge Anna Quindlen fan. This isn't my favorite of hers, but I enjoyed the read. Hated to see it end."
1,BLESSINGS SHOULD'VE BEEN TITLED BORING!!!,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. NOT ONE OF ANNA'S BEST WORKS. THE CHARACTERS LACKED DEPTH AND THE STORY DRAGGED ALONG LIKE A SLOW DEATH. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
3,"Good read, heartwarming, good character development","Nice book. Anna Quindlen does a great job developing the characters, setting the scene. I could see and feel every aspect of the estate Blessings in my mind. Loved the way she developed Skips characters and the suprises about Benny and Sunny. Good read. Not the best book I ever ead but enjoyable. Great for a raining day and a warm blanket."
3,Who Cares?,"The story was sort of fun, if unbelievable, but the character development was really poor. I think we were supposed to really admire Ms. Blessing, but I found her life incredibly narrow and her late life ""enlightenment"" too little, too late. In all, a very unsatisfying read. Compared to her brilliant ""Newseek"" essays, Anna Quindlen writes rather silly novels."
1,extremely boring,The plot moves along very slowly.Pages and pages go by without much happening.A lot of repetitions also. The author would keep repeatingthe same thing over and over. She like to say thing again even though she said it earlier. (see how annoying that can get???)
2,It lodges in the mind as few recent novels have.,"The book is inspired, original... As the mountains gentle toward the sea-with mother and child locked in a ghostly grip-the narrative tact, the perfect economy of effect defy criticism. The analogies with Moby Dick are patent. Anna Quindlen invites the prodigous comparison. What more can one say?"
1,Wake me up when it's over,"I had to read this for book club or I would have never made it past page 40. Nothing happens except for endless paragraphs of torturously detailed descriptions of things I could care less about, which did not advance the story at all. I had no affinity for any of the characters. It felt like a short story written by an earnest high school student that somehow morphed into a full length novel."
3,A reader,"I heard so many wonderful things about this book and had to read it. I like the book, but was not too impressed with the writing style. I felt as if the book was a slow read. I felt that Anna Quindlen jumped around and never went into much depth. I read it all the way through hoping it would get better, but never did."
4,"I liked this story, you have to overlook the words.","This story is about how even the meanest, nastiest, people can be overcome by the power of love. A baby left in a cardboard box by the richest woman in town's house. The maintenance man finds it, and the baby, he decides the first time she smiles at him, is his. But he cannot keep the baby a secret forever, he must hide her from his former cellmate and law breaking friend, and mostly from the lady of the house. The house is called ""Blessings"", and throughout this book, many blessings are bestowed on this house, the people in it, and the power of one small infant to change everything and everyone. The ending, a little disappointing, but look behind the words, there is so much meaning you can grasp and incorporate into your heart."
3,relationships,"a little slow at first, but digs into relationships, how people can react contrary to what's expected, that others do not always have it as good as everyone might think. The grass isn't always greener, some just suffer in silence, friends come from unlikely places, social justice, etc."
4,Blessings~,"Skip Cuddy is a young man with not the best reputation in town. He's living above the garage at the Blessings Estate, where he's landed a job as a handyman. While the story that Quindlen tells, is about Skip discovering a newborn infant in a box on his door step, the real story of Blessings is so much more.When the story begins there are many amusing scenes of an inexperienced guy trying to care for an infant. As the story develops we see how a reclusive old widow with a lot of money, and a poor uneducated handyman with a bad rap, are brought together in the most unusual of circumstances. The cast of characters in Blessings is rich and endearing. The ideas of lost dreams, secrets, beauty and love are all exposed in this well written and engaging novel."
3,How could Anna do this to me?,"I won't rehash the story because the other reviews do a splendid job of that. I will say what I came her to query - which is that I cannot understand for the life of me why a writer would end such a brilliant book so badly? I love Anna Quindlan's work. I adore her. But I am clueless as to how she could put so much heart and effort into a story and come up with the ending she did. And why did any editor accept it? The conclusion of this book goes against every single thing that it gave along the way. Reading BLESSINGS was akin to the most beautiful and soul-inspiring drive ever taken, only to arrive at an overgrown cemetary or a land-fill. Why oh why did she do this to me?"
3,"An ""Okay"" Book-Needed More Character Depth","In this story, a teenage couple drives up, late at night, headlights out, to Blessings, the estate owned by Lydia Blessing. They leave a box and take off, and in this instant, the world of Blessings is changed forever. Blessings telles us the story of Skip Cuddy, who is caretaker of the estate, who finds a baby asleep in the box that was left there. He wants to keep her, and Lydia, for her own reasons decides to go along with Skip and help him. The secrets of the past, how they affect the decisions and lives of people in the present, what makes a person, a life, legitimate or illegitimate, and who decides; the unique resources people find in themselves and in a community- are told in this novel.I felt that the story needed more development of the characters for certain, and the author could have given them more backgrounds and depth. Something was missing along that line for sure."
1,Character is out of character.,"Some books are page turners - you can't put them down. This is a book that I could not pick up. After reading some four chapters, that was it. Ms. QUINDLEN does not prepare us for her ex-con keeping the baby. Way, way out of character. Sure, I read science fiction and enjoy it, and I suspend disbelief in phasers, teleportation, and faster-than-light travel. But people should be real. I will not suspend belief about that. If you want to read about players that change character at the drop of a hat, or drop of a baby, then buy this book. If not - then click to the next offering."
1,When The West Was Young,"As a fan of the western genre, I had no problem with the acting and plot line as they are typical of 1930's era films. That said, this is probably the worst tape to DVD transfer I've ever seen. Saturday morning TV presentations weren't this bad. Stay away from this film in it's current form (Alpha Home Entertainment ALP 5205D distributed by [...]). It's almost unwatchable."
2,An introduction not worth the money! but maybe for the very beginners,"First of all this is a DVD-R not Original silver DVD!! has some scratches on the surface, (the same old VHS tape version but converted to a DVD!!) I recommend this if it's the first time in your life and want to learn midi and sampling, because the first day I use a sampler I learned a lot more than this myself without any help."
4,Great Movie,This movie takes you on a mind bending ride that leads up to an almost mind blowing climax.
3,Not all directors deserve a director's cut,I have seen Donnie Darko many times and I love the movie. The Director's Cut is a confusing rendition of the original that is devoid of most of the open interpretation the movie once had. I will not watch this version again.
3,"good, but overrated...","I thought Donnie Darko was a decent movie, and I can definitely understand how it became the cult classic it is. However, my personal opinion is that the movie is highly overrated by its followers. Though it brings up interesting questions, ""Donnie Darko"" doesn't really add anything to the floor."
2,Huh?,"I really did not ""get"" this movie. I was very confused by the ending. I rented this movie thinking it was a thriller but its more science fiction, what with the concept of time travel. I felt there were characters in this movie which did not pertain to the main story line and added little to the plot. It took me three days to watch this film. Althought some parts of it were amusing, and interesting, I overall thought it a dull movie and not worth the time or the money I spent to rent it. And watch it TWICE??!!??? I dont think so."
2,Deep? Vague? Brilliant? Pretentious?,"I don't know the answer, but I didn't enjoy the DVD. I can find almost anything in a movie that will make me want to watch it again, but honestly, I'd just like to sell my copy of this one. I resent some of these reviews where the people who loved it are calling those of us who didn't stupid for not seeing the brilliance. I'm not stupid and I suspect that the only people who really saw anything deep in this movie were those who were on drugs, or who had very, very active imaginations.The filming and sound are good, the acting was pretty good but as far as plot, humor, empathy or interest in characters - I didn't see much if any and I just couldn't wait for it to end. Boring, depressing, confusing."
5,Godless god-fullness,"Are you one of those fellas who would like to smack God in the back of the head and drop it off on the NJ Turnpike (buck-naked)--and yet find a strange attraction to it's beautiful design--? Are you fascinated by relativity, signs, kissing, and honesty. Have you found yourself floating in a pool wondering why you have a body? Then by all means, buy yourself a can of Donnie Darko. (N.B. This review is meant to be read with a 50's Crystler commercial-guy tone to it.)"
3,Donnie Darko not great on blu-ray,"This is one of my favorite films of all time, and when i heard it was on blu-ray, i couldn't wait to get it. after viewing it last night, i realized that this is just a straight transfer from the original DVD. So, if you are looking for that eye-popping detail, you won't see it here. just stick to your DVD that is already in your collection."
3,Interesting,Donnie suffers from a sleep disorder. He often finds himself waking up in places he didn't fall asleep and his family is so accustomed to it that it's practically humorous. Troubled teen takes new meaning when a demonic rabbit appears to Donnie and sends him down a road which will change not only his life but the lives of his community. In therapy and on anti-psychotic drugs you are forced to decide whether the good Doc or drugs are helping or hindering. Good Donnie or bad Donnie? The decision shouldn't be a hard one while you waft through a parade of lifeless characters that seem to be gasping for breath only because it's second nature to keep trying. A psychological thriller to say the least with some sci-fi thrown in for good measure. A very interesting flick--not for those who dislike trying to figure it all out. The official web site makes great use of flash but you'd have to watch the movie to understand it.
5,Buy it!,"Wow! Simply one of the best films I have ever seen. Do yourself a favour and buy it NOW. I am utterly blown away. Richard Kelly, you are a genius."
3,great but bad ending,"Captain Corelli's Mandolin would have been my favourite novel of all time if it wasn't for the ending, which appears hastily written and grafted. Similarly, the ending to Donnie Darko, which is an original and hypnotic movie (see other reviews), feels as if the makers had to finish it off in order for it to be released. There are so many inconsistencies and at the risk of being called a nerd, the writer(s) either forgot or ignored the problems of temporal paradox. (Please see Back to the Future and co.) A temporal vortex cannot solve bad script writing.A reviewer to Captain Corelli's Mandolin said that one should not complain about a fine meal if only the coffee was bad, however, it does leave a bad taste in your mouth..."
3,I'm hunting wabbit,"I think this film really stands out against all other movies of that year. I think the acting is superb(Gyllenhall, and there were definite surprise(Patrick Swayze); I think that the influence of the late eighties is obvious and handled with authority by the director...future seems bright for him."
1,Depression on Steroids,"I bought this movie at the recommendation of a friend, and was extremely regretful of doing so. This movie, in my opinion, was dreary, depressing, creepy, and downright lousy. I don't know how anyone, unless they are on drugs, could enjoy this film. This film puts nothing on your mind except depression and death. I personally prefer movies that show the true beauty of life, such as the recently released Big Fish. Finally, if you are not depressed, Donnie Darko will still surely cast a shadow of darkness and depression over your day."
2,Drew Barrymore meets Nikos Kazantzakis,"is he mad? or is life just nuts? pretty shallow.important elements arekey: ""how long have i been asleep?"" ""the whole movie.""repeated reference to the last temptation of christ (as a horror film in a kentucky-fried christian town), a replay of hallucinatory time-travel and alternative future in dialogue with the devil at the moment of death, in a mickey-mouse version of christ's choice in his last temptationmock allusion to elements of christ's life- donnie's denunciation of a false priest, and subsequent persecutionincreasingly magical life events, confronted by- the inevitability of isolated death (roberta sparrow's demented loss of both fear and love (of god) which are inseparable and lost together)- the sudden finality of death (donnie chooses either himself, or else gretchen, both in a deus ex machinae mode).good ideas, but needs some mature reorganisation and representation"
5,Gift for My Son,Excellent buying Experience - gift was greatly appreciated. Highly recommend seller.
2,"Dark, unclear, and drowned in misery","This movie is dark and unclear. What happened anyway? You have some really miserable characters, some really evil ones who need to get dealt with. The evil they do is just suffered through, without a response. There's some sort of supernatural garbage going on, or maybe there isn't and maybe it is just some insanity. Booga booga. This movie wasn't for me. If you enjoyed it, good for you. I don't know why I'm not giving it just one star. Something about it was appealing, but it was drowned in misery. You like misery?"
3,Kind of strange,"Donnie hears that the world ends 28 days in the future. He lives the 28 days and then realizes this is no good life this way. Instead, he decided to go back. Is all of life predetermined or is there really free will? As Donnie says himself, there is no way to know and it isn't worth arguing."
4,Deceiving title - Great movie!,"My 15 yr old, despite my objections roped me into this movie. Glad she did! Great suspense movie, not at all predictable.Basically a movie about time travel. If your looking for a movie that doesn't feel as you've wasted you time when your finished- Dont miss this one!"
4,"Its a ""blink""er","This is one of those /headtilt movies. I think the concept of it was cool, acting was amazing, but the concept did throw me for a loopty loop. I just couldn't put it all together, I think if I watch it again then maybe I'll understand a bit better. But even if you don't get the deep down meaning behind it all, its still very well acted and a mindpuzzle.(didn't want to add profanity there ^.^) So, I say watch it no matter what you hear, cuz there are a lot of different opinions on it. Jake does a marvolous job and he deserves kudos."
5,fantastic.,"Before you read my review, know that the individual from ontario who gave this movie 2 stars probably has never even seen the movie, and of course, has not seen the directors cut. This is a movie which will leave you questioning what it is you just saw. You'll want to watch again as soon as its over. The Directors cut also fills in many of the holes left by the original, as well as change the feel of nearly ever character, Frank being the most important. He is no longer the 'satanic bunny' but rather a messenger from God. So in short, watch this movie, and be blown away!"
1,wow,i heard great things on this movieI hated it looks dull grainy blotchysounds ok but this movie was borringdragged on
1,"OK, OK, I give up...",You all honestly think this a great film. Really? Wow. You're dumber than you look.
1,Super Creepy,"Okay, everyone talks about what a ""masterpiece"" this movie is and I just don't get it. All it is is a creepy disturbed movie with an incredibly scary giant rabbit that tells you to do things. The film also left so much information about the main character's past out and jumped around too much. Even the added magic, apocolypse, and time travel couldn't help this movie. I give it an F+"
2,Come on People!,"this is a movie that tries to be something it is not...deep. Yes, that is right. This is not a deep, meaningful flick. Not even Richard Kelly knew what the heck is was doing or even why he did it. The reasons he did give were so incredibly dissapointing and plainly idiotic. He gets kudos for reading a couple of familiar and meaningful books but that is all. It is just fantastic how many try to articulate supposed meanings into this film when not even its writer/director knew what the heck he was doing. There is more substance in the attempted interpretations than this film could ever have. It is amazing how people let their imaginations run wild in trying to decifer reasons. this is a good film to watch while reading your favorite book on a comfy couch.."
5,Great Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it over 10 times and it gets better every time I watch it. This achieves what many movies cannot, its very well worth your time, and will make you think. Whether or not you have seen this movie, you should buy the DVD. It is excellent."
5,of the best movies ever made,"oh man, this movie is wonderful.i just read a top 500 reviewer say this movie wasn't good. when i went to see what else this person had reviewed, i noticed they gave scooby-doo 5 stars.so now you know you shouldn't listen to THAT person.i simply couldn't take my eyes off this movie. it answers all of your questions, you just have to be smart enough to know when it does. and i thought the acting and script were good.buy it."
4,A should see movie,"If you enjoy movies that are a bit on the dark side and completely unclassifiable, Donnie Darko is the one for you. Well done, thought provoking, funny, creepy, and disturbing all in one package. Original to say the absolute least although, I'll admit, it's not for everyone.Pay no attention to the bad reviews from the shallow people who said it was ""too weird"" or ""Just not that good"". It's supposed to be weird and if you like a film that makes you shudder as you're trying to figure it out then, again, this one's for you. If not - don't waste your time.You should plan on watching it several times to get the full effect as there is a lot going on and no one catches everything the first time around.In my honest opinion, a very well done original movie."
5,Nothing Compares,"Beautiful. That's all you need to know. This is the most original, ingenious film I've ever seen. Time travel, insanity, teenage angst, love, family, sacrifice, horror, and so much more to this film. The acting is superb, the plot is fun and different, and the soundtrack is used to maximum effect. The end result is a haunting, enjoyable, touching story that will leave you thinking and smiling with an aching heart."
4,Looks great and the acting is fantastic!,"This is a flawed gem. It has everything from up-and-coming of age drama, sci-fi, horror and bags of philosophy. This is a metaphysics wet dream of a movie and it does move along at a fairly rapid pace and is very funny in parts. The only thing is that the ending is a bit of a let down, but the music score is as memorable as say - Halloween and certainly this is one of the best indie pics we have seen in years. Watch out for this new talent because on the bases of this first movie he is sure to fire out some remarkable stuff on a better budget."
5,confusingly awesome,"If you enjoy movies that make you think, or movies that go beyond on ending. I'm sure you like this. Its ""DARK"" deminer is just a little reminder that life isnt all peaches. The little conversations that random character have are something to pay attention to when you demaindingly watch it the 4th or 5th time. They give insite to pretty much all those big life question everyone and there kids ask. This movie is an Universe in and of itself, which as you know is a what makes a classic film. No doubt that this is one of the best movies I have scene and bought in a long time."
3,"Good movie, but can only access with internet access","I really love this movie, its a great psychology flick but I have two issues, I cant get it on my mobile device, and I can only access it with an internet access. I wont use the Amazon movie store again"
4,Donnie Darko,"It was a strange, but understandable movie. I did try an internet search after watching it to get the ""finer points"" of the film because I was intrigued -- even though I felt satisfied by the movie's ending. A good movie with an excellent soundtrack. I mistakenly watched it with closed captions on -- and that really seemed to work for me."
4,Excellent,"This movie was entertaining for the entire duration. That said, I think it should be watched more than once for somebody to distil its full meaning. I had a sense after watching this movie for the first time that I had missed a lot of the context surrounding the plot. After going online I came across the AMAZING website that accompanies this movie, and a copy of the lady's diary. Without reading the diary, I don't think its possible to understand the movie fully. The Director's Cut is an interesting opportunity to learn more about the original intent of the movie's creators and brought me back for a 3rd and 4th viewing. Highly recommended.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,perfect,"This movie is a gem! One of the most original, complex movies I have ever seen! Buy it, enjoy it, treasure it!"
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"I just finished watching this movie and cannot believe that I wasted my time on it. The writers tried to make a story that was believable and it just wasn't - there were so many facets to this dimly lit diamond of a movie that it ended being so vague with so many questions unanswered. Even the ending was ""out of this world"" with regard to logic and good movie theme. I bought this movie based upon the rave reviews. But this movie completely failed in every category. Don't waste your money on it. I don't care what the other 800+ viewers wrote praising this movie. It is a ""crash and burn"", DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, movie."
1,I guess I missed something???,"I fell asleep half-way through this movie, which I found just about as interesting as watching paint dry. Music in the movie was pretty good though. A lot of people seem to be raving about the movie here so maybe I'm wrong. Just wasn't for me I guess."
1,Here's a viable alternative,"If you're even thinking about buying this movie, have the clerk take you out back and give you a savage beating after taking your money. That way, you won't have to sit through this and the pain only be momentary.Trust me, I know this is better than the alternative.And if you're renting it, well, you're just asking for it."
5,donnie darko a must SEE,"this film has to be one of the greatest films of all time. it has a clever story and characters you can relate to in real life, except frank the giant bunny which is a clever thing in its own way. If you don't own this film buy it NOW. it's a must see and a must own all round for everyone. The basic storyline is a boy who sleep walks and sees a giant bunny called frank telling him the world is going to end. It has a lot to do with time travel...."
5,Thought-provoking and beautifully crafted -- worth watching again and again!,"OK, OK. So I think Jake Gyllenhaal is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and if I were a teenager, I would have posters of him plastered all over my wall. I also adore Mary McDonnell as well and would probably watch a film with her in it even if it were a depiction of a Paramecium's journey into adulthood.My biases aside, I think this film is absolutely terrific. It's haunting and beautifully made. Even the soundtrack enhances the film and the songs stick with you, reminding of the scenes they supported.I have watched this film several times, and each time I notice something different.It leaves you feeling sad and happy; concerned and satisfied; and alive.I highly recommend this film. It's out of the ordinary but down to earth."
2,Too much tinkering with a good thing,"I love ""Donnie Darko"", but was rather disappointed with this overhyped Director's Cut. The film is now overexplained and overcooked, traits that made the original theatrical / DVD release so mesmerizing (incidentally, the 20 minutes added are already on the original DVD). The director's choice to replace the Echo & the Bunnymen ""Killing Moon"" song with INXS' ""Never Tear Us Apart"" ruined the beginning of the film for me.Stick with the original."
2,Buy the ORIGINAL Theatrical Release of this film,"Donnie Darko is an excellent movie in the original theatrical release. It has some ambiguous imagery and plot twists that engage the viewer and will cause discussion after watching the movie the first time. After a second (or even third) viewing, you will understand nuances missed the first time around.The director's cut adds unnecessary material that breaks the flow of the story and detracts significantly from most viewers' final impression of the movie and what it was about."
2,Cult favorite is a hit-and-miss affair,"DONNIE DARKO(USA - 2001)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalA lonely high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) is beset by visions which portend either a mental breakdown or the End of the World...Richard Kelly's debut film aims for cult status at every level but fails to fly off the screen. Though a fine actor, Gyllenhaal is basically miscast, and Kelly's style is too laidback to make much of an impact. Cult favorite James Duval (a regular in Gregg Araki's outrageous movies) makes a cameo appearance as the object of Gyllenhaal's strange 'visions'. Fine use of the wide Panavision frame.A re-edited director's cut was subsequently released on home video."
3,Original Yet Derivative Sci-Fi,"One thing you can say about ""Donnie Darko"" is that it is certainly an ambitious film. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is original,though. It struck me as a less accessible Shyamalan film bogged down in psycho-babble, teen angst, and scientific mumbo jumbo. That is not to say that director Richard Kelly doesn't keep the action moving, just confusing, like some David Lynch films. The cast here performs earnestly with the material given them. My understanding is that this film has developed a sizable cult following and I would respond to that,""Whatever!"""
5,mike white,"No question about it. This movie has it all. Acting, effects, storyline, plot. You name it, it has it baby. The only thing else i can say is that its, hands down, the best movie of the century so far. There is not a movie that can touch it.yeah baby"
4,Blew me away......,"This movie raised the bar for directors and actors alike. DD will be loved or hated, no room for middle of the road folks. Regardless of if you are a fan of Independence Day (or similar movies) you ""will"" talk about this movie. As stated in other reviews, the cinematography is outstanding and the acting is incredible. A must see for avid movie fans!!"
2,It just wasn't that good...,"I'm sure there are many attempts on the internet to figure out all the inner workings of this film, but i couldnt help but wonder whether the film itself knew what it was talking about. Sure, you had weird rabbits, numbers, time travel... but with all of these details and elaborate connections, we never really get a sense of the heart of the movie - only a glimpse at a glitch in time which results in a boy choosing to die when he has the chance. This movie promises to be something big and intreguing, but it never tells us why. All we are left with is the green rabbit, ""cellar door,"" and perhaps a vague impression that Donnie doesnt think we're alone. So what? It seems to me that ll the hype surrounding this movie is an attempt to find completion in the mediocre ending.If you are looking for a serious thought provoking, time travel movie, check out Terry Gilliams ""Twelve Monkeys"" instead."
3,bleh,"Having been into the wierder, darker movies my whole life my friend pushed me to see this movie after I told him some of my favorite movies. (Tidus, Natural born killers, THX 1138)Unfotunatle even though the movies entertaining. and the ending somewhat suprising, the movie failed to leave me with any lasting effects. I just wasn't really that interested in the ""depth"" alot of people seem to get out of this movie, since all just pointless depth for depths sake. It doesn't address anything important, just uses a tapestry of sci-fi, religious schitzophrenic psycological under tones to enhance a other wise normal love story with a pretty cliched, sacrifice ending.I would reccomened it for people who are in desperate need of something different to watch, but please ""Rent"" the movie or by it cheap first."
3,What's the point?,"What was the point of this movie? I think they just tried to make a very confusing movie so it'll look very intelligent. I don't think even the director fully understood the movie.But I still give it 3 stars for it being original and moody, something rare in the movies these days."
1,Director's cut is NOT as good as studio release,"I know, I know. It's hard to believe, but it's true. The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is TERRIBLE compared to the studio release. The way the film is pieced together is not nearly as effective as the original, nor were the director's choices in terms of soundtrack. Please, if you are going to buy this film for a Donnie Darko fanatic, buy them the studio release instead.By the way, before you slam my review, please know that I am a devotee of Donnie Darko. I've seen it several times at midnight screenings at Two Boots Theater in Alphabet City (in NYC, baby!)."
4,Any film with over 300 reviews,"has got something going for it. I think the movie hits the literary equivalent of the ""personal fallacy,"" wherein because something hits someone hard for personal reasons, they tend to rate it higher as ""art"" than it, perhaps, deserves. Well, I am one of the victims of the fallacy. While flawed, it has some genuinely beautiful moments and captures the strange and dreamlike world of some teenagers perfectly. For all of us who grew up feeling possibly border-line schizophrenic, its weirdness is like--oh, I don't know-- going back in time."
2,Pretty Good!!!,"... but not nearly the mind-bogglingly original 5-star masterpiece people on the internet are making it out to be.It amuses me to see how many people give this movie 5-stars. Where, then, does that put the truly suspenseful and original films of people like Polanski, Kubrick, Hitchock, Murnau and other masters?It also cracks me up to see how anybody who posts a negative review of Donnie Darko gets slammed with negative votes -- didn't Donnie's attitude about not following the pack influence anyone? I'm prepared to take negative hits. In fact, I'm going for the record, please help me reach it.This is a good idea for a movie with a great sense of atmosphere, but Donnie acts likes a jerk most of the time. Richard Kelly is an interesting director. If his follow-up to ""Donnie"" deserves half the accolades his debut won, it should be the greatest movie of the decade."
1,Bad Blu-Ray transfer,I love this movie and would give it 5 stars. But the Blu-ray version is really bad. They didn't even make the special features in HD. The movie looks really bad. You can tell the difference by looking at the previews in the disc and then watching the movie. I am really disappointed in this.
3,Good but to much HYPE!,"This was a good movie but to much hype that it was kind of a let down in the end. The beggining was good but the end made little sense and it was hard for me to understand the complicated plot line (and trust me im good about knowing whats happeing in movies). The bunny was by far the reason for seeing this movie even tho there was little of him seen, so it was a let down. The ""smerf"" speech was the best moment in the movie and i liked how the movie it self was very humorous. All in all, a good movie but dont expect the greatest movie in al of history."
4,Jake,I bought it because I thought I wanted to see Jake in a different type of role. I did! Movie too dark for him. Would like to see some more comedy that is intended to be comedy.
5,Excelent!!!!,"i just to say excelent edition, very complete, and the best is the most mysterious movie that i have seen!!"
2,Not what I expected it to be!,"I'll give Donnie Darkko credit for his character's challenge to the status quo of school, family and friends. There's even some humor in it. Then there's his interesting ideas about time travel but after that his character becomes such a s*** head and the movie takes a dive. You're better off renting it, rather than owing it."
4,a superior version,"don't listen to these whiners, the same thing happened with the star wars: special editions as well as blade runner among other things. fan uproar. get your panties in a bunch, why doncha!truth is this is the director's original vision, it brings things into much more clarity while still remaining very ambiguous. the changes are so subtle that unless you were a die-hard fan you won't notice (or care).the director's cut is certainly not a smarter or dumber movie, the pacing is a little more relaxed (which is a good thing!!!) and the effects are a little touched up. big deal. this is still, if barely, a superior version."
1,tries too hard,"I gave this away to a sophomore in college. they hated it as I did, but they gave it to another person who loved it..go figure. Not my thing...I felt myself rolling my eyes and thinking ""oh, brother"" or ""give me a break"" the whole time. I like symbolism movies that make you think, but it seemed this one just tried to hard only to be that, and not enough at trying to be a good movie, too. Some may like it better much than I did, but it might be more of a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movie. I wish I would have rented it first."
1,Buyer Beware,"I like suspense, horror, cult stuff etc. This film sucks. Plot is thin, filmmaking is high school; it is not a keeper. It is not even worth watching. I cannot believe anybody gave this a rating; your time is better spent watching a box of cheerios."
4,Donnie Darko,"I went into my room to watch this movie, I was skeptical, because it was compared to ""Final Destination"", which I did not like at all. Lets just say that I am glad I watched it. The movie, stars the kid from ""Bubble Boy"" who did an amazing acting job, and with roles as diverse as ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Bubble Boy"" I consider him an artist, and am happy that he hasnt been type cast into ""stoner"" comedy roles, because he did an amazing job. Any way I digress, the movie was stunning, not only visually, but conceptually. It had a ""david lynch"" type feel to it, but easier to follow. The imagery used in the movie was great, especially the bunny, and the ""spears"" from his chest. And like any other ""lynch"" type movie you walk away thinking about how it all broke down in the end, wondering exactally what happened... Dont let the super-heroish title fool you, the movie is anything but super hero based film."
4,"Dark, Darkest, Darko.","""Donnie Darko""- a beautiful, haunting film. Although the ending leaves the entire experience open to interpretation, the journey through the film itself is what's important, and it truly is that.Darkly illuminating. Terrifyingly warm. Hopefully fearful. Dark, Darkest, Darko."
4,awesome movie,"Donnie Darko is a must see. One of the greats, and this version of it only makes it that much better"
4,Donnie Darko,"A curious movie, in the mould of David Lynch.Donnie Darko is a film you'll either going to love and hate.The 80's election setting is a very original and Frank The Rabbit is decidedly creepy. Drew Barrymore is rather sexy as a rogue teacher."
3,Story doesn't quite click because of excessive editing,"Owes much to David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" in terms of structure and narrative concept. Sets a mood very effectively but the actual plotline is not effectively conveyed with the available film footing. Reference the DVD features to get an impression of what was actually intended. The film is otherwise mysterious and in some ways perplexing because it wanted to be two different movies, at least, and luckily some of the components meshed as if to convey a whole. Worthwhile viewing though it's essentially a very beautifully filmed Twilight Zone ep plot-wise."
5,Can't stop watching it....,"Listen, I've seen every movie you could name and NOTHING tops this. It makes every other movie boring!! I've had it for 2 weeks and I've watched it over 30 times. Do yourself a favor..."
2,Donnie Darko,"I just didn't get it. I was not impressed, did not gain information, and was not entertained. I was in search for movies about bipolar and schizophrenia. I made a poor choice with this selection."
3,Love this movie,"I love this movie how ever i think the regular cut is much better. Also when i removed the bubble rap the disk case had opened and 1 disk had slipped out, no scratches but the case isn't that sturdy."
5,Huh? Ah-ha! Hmm.,"That's what you'll be thinking while you watch this film. Donnie Darko is the best movie you've never heard about. As others have said, it's hard to classify: funny, confusing, disturbing, odd, and imaginative all rolled into one. But nicely done, keeping your interest and making you wonder where things are going and what will happen next. Jake Gyllenhaal is cute and pensive; he could be mistaken as a brother to Toby Maguire. Watch the DVD extras; the deleted scene commentaries shed some light on a few things. But you'll probably not completely ""get"" this movie, which is part of its charm since you'll keep thinking about it for days after seeing it."
5,Donnie Darko,This is probally one of the best films that i've seen of 2001 it directed Beautifully and just everyone in it iz amazing. specially Jenna malone (gretchen) Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) and there are good perfomences by Patrcik swayze and Drew Barrymore . I deffinetly give it Two thumbs Way up and 10 starz
5,AMAZING,"i didn't know a movie could change your life, 'till i saw donnie darko. this movie is stunning, it grabs you, i highly reccommend it. unbelievable soundtrack too, gary jules, joy division, echo in the bunnymen, 5 stars. see it."
2,Not up to the hype,"I saw this movie sometime last year for the first time with two of my friends. At first watching it seemed very good, however after viewing only one more time I realized I was wrong. This movie has several plot holes, a horrible poorly executed ending, and very little interesting dialogue. Also, I noticed that some people who say they like the movie like it for its apparent ""theoretical"" significance, but don't be fooled. The people I know who have said this are actually just trying to sound smart which is obvious due to the fact that this movie is in no way theoretical. In fact, this film is liked mostly due to it's lame cliche moral having to do with the decisions we as humans make. Despite this, it did have good acting roles and a decent soundtrack."
1,I have tried..and tried again,"I am sorry, I love memento, lost in translation, lebowski tannenbaums. What is the deal with this movie. I have tried to watch it 6 or 7 times, and each time I find myself becoming distracted and doing something else. I just don't get it, I respect the opinion of many people who have seen it, and like it, I think they have good taste. Why can't I get it, I find this movie to be so boring I want to gouge my eyes out. I mean maybe because I remember 1988, and I was around the age of the kids in the movie, it doesn't seem so weird to me or something. But I am here to openly admit that I DON'T GET IT...and I get a lot of odd movie. I even think Gylenhall is a good actor, but alas I find this movie revolting"
2,Lots of style & atmosphere but not enough substance,"I tried to get into this movie but the expectation was so high, because of a ridiculously false hype, that when I saw it, it was inevitably a big let down.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's not a bad mvoie. The performances are quite moving. It comes at you from interesting angles and the characters are subteley bizzare.The problem with the flick is that once you get past the daring artistry, the movie is pretty boring. There's not a lot going on. I know I may sound old, but the whole ""what do you mean you didn't know you were dead? on your way to dying bit "" has been done in TV shows, movies etc.I think the director's narrative and theme were much more interesting than the actual story."
3,Get original DVD instead,"Even though the Director's Cut is the ""vision"" of Richard Kelly, the tweaking of the DVD has not been well recieved. From the changing of music, new Frankie voice-overs like ""mail her a letter"" and the cheesy computer graphics, the Director's Cut DVD is better left in the bargain bin. Don't get me wrong... it is still a great movie and I liked the 20 minutes of extra footage. My biggest problem (besides the handholding of the film to you) is the ""computer grid"" effect at the climax with the fireworks. If you love movies and want a more rounded version of the film, get the original and stick with it."
4,Not the director's cut?,"I love this movie, I love the theatrical version, but I really love the Director's Cut! I am disappointed that the Blu-Ray release does not have the longer version on it, which I feel is a much more complete movie."
2,BUY THE THEATRICAL VERSION!!,"Had I have read a RECENT review about how horribly Richard Kelly butchered his beautiful theatrical version on this RECENT Director's Cut release, I would NOT have bought THIS DVD.IT DOESN'T EVEN START THE SAME!!! Instead of Echo and the Bunnymen, it's INXS (INXS was a great band, but ""Killing Moon"" set the pace in the original) The added scenes tried way too hard to explain the events, making the Director's Cut more frustrating to enjoy.Donnie Darko is a SPECTACULAR movie! Get the THEATRICAL version!"
2,inventive? yes. a masterpiece? no.,"I was curious to see what everyone was raving about, so I decided to give it a whirl. One can't catogorize this movie; there are so many elements in it. Teenage 80's, scifi, etc. But I would say this is more of a - put the mystery together type of movie. I give it credit for being original, but i can't help but wonder from beginning to end, ""when is this gonna end?"" My girlfriend totally hated this movie. It spread itself thin trying to put every genre together. There were quite a few funny parts though - one being a funny smurf conversation.Sure, i understand what's going on. But, you should rent this one first, cause it's not for everyone. Along the same lines as this is muholland drive, which is far better. Same with final destination."
5,"A wonderful, rewatchable, mind-bender","I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, being a bit skeptical given the general description. There is a bit of Memento in this, but not quite as twisty. Jake G. does a great job, as does the supporting cast. The screenplay was very tightly written, with few (any?) inconsistencies or plot holes that I could identify. In the end, everything ties together very nicely."
4,Director's Cut,"This includes only the director's cut, not both the standard and director's cuts. I assumed it included both. What's the problem? The music is different on many scenes. It's still an excellent movie though."
2,**,"I haven't been as disappointed with a film people have raved about since THE DOOM GENERATION. THE DOOM GENERATION was a piece of junk from beginning to end, while DONNIE DARKO does have some witty dialogue and some great acting. But overall it just did not remotely live up to the raves. A lot of the movie is terribly contrived. If you raved about this film and haven't seen THE DOOM GENERATION, you probably should. That's an inverted recommendation, I know."
2,Incredibly Slow and Pretentious,"Hard as it is to break from the pack, I have to admit I found this cross between Back To The Future and a Dawson's Creek that takes itself way too seriously to be highly overrated. Acting like it invented the satirical look at new-age philosophy and sudden surrealist imagery, the twist at the end makes it look like Donnie was suffering from a teenage martyrdom fantasy, which is hardly worth the price of a DVD. Go rent My Own Private Idaho if you want at least a mildly less tight-assed (no pun intended) film of hot young actors coming to hallucinatory grips with the world."
2,Darko Shmarko,"I have heard A LOT about this movie, in that it will blow my mind, it's like nothing you've ever seen, etc. etc. That's not quite true, I've seen OTHER bad movies also. If you've seen REAL movies of this ilk, like Jacobs Ladder or 12 Monkeys, you'll think of Donnie Darko as a teen rip off... how's that for a mental image?? This same story has also been used countless times on Serlings Twilight Zone (minus the terrible acting).Nothing about this movie was really worth watching, the pacing, performances, dialogue... nothing. Even the much belly-whooed ""Rabbit"" lost it's charm after the second appearance. The two stars are for the lead (Darko was decent) and the 2 discs have a lot of info (sadly they are ABOUT this MOVIE). Barrymore consisted of nothing more than dead weight and Swayze was even worse. Take my advice; Don't always believe the hype."
5,Great Psychological Thriller,One of the best Psycho Thrillers I've ever seen. You have to see it twice....just get's better and better every time.
4,Buy it,now im not telling you its so good you want to watch it over and over for fun but to figure out the complete story not that im sawing its a bad movie its great but kinda confusing. it all about time travle. not like back to the future time travle but diffrent. so still buy it or atleast rent it a few times.
2,Not all as cracked up to be,"I rented this film recently because of all the ""cult hype"" I had heard regarding this feature. I was disappointed to say the least. The actors really carry this film, doing their best with what little plot there is to it. Some might say that I just didn't get the film, but I think the weaknesses, especially the expected ending, support my argument. Several scenes were just over the top in a way that didn't appear realistic. It just seemed like a film that promised a lot, but couldn't deliver. Did this film make me think? Sure, it made me think that this film really didn't have a whole lot going for it."
3,Huh?,"I just recently viewed this film because I kept hearing everyone talk about how good this movie was. Well I finally sat one day and watched it for myself. Lets see... how can I put this...Donnie Darko is one of those matrix type movies were you really have to pay attention, if not you can be completly lost in a blink of an eye. BUT, I think that is what intrigued me the most. Not being able to figure out what was going to happen in the end, unlike other predictable chick flicks, was all I needed to keep my attention. So over all I did enjoy this movie, just remember to pay attention."
1,horrible packaging.,"Let me just start off by saying I love this movie. I rented it a week ago and now I want to buy it. The thing is, when I got the movie the discs were out of the slots and sliding around the case. I checked and they were a little scratched. I am sending it back for a new copy."
5,Everbody Dies Alone,"this movie is officially not only the best movie I have ever seen, but on eof the most confusing movies ever to be made. If you dont want to watch a movie over and over, than ONT WATCH THIS ONE! there is no way that you could understand it in one sitting, and if you do, give Harvard a call, they'll want ya.this movie is the touching, sometimes comical story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teen with obvious mental issues growing up in the 1980's. He soon starts having visions of a rabbit, who tells him that world will ned 28 days later, on Halloween. Whyll he is being told this, an airplane engine crashes into his room. it surely would have killed him, had it not been for this mysterious rabbit. is it all in his head, or is the world really ending? You decide."
2,NO GREAT CLASSIC HERE.,"This movie has a ... long drawn out ending,that makes me really despise it.i won't give it away,but up until that point i found it mildly interesting,and kinda clever.and then it truly drops the ball at the end,Thumbs down big time.The director never explains this glaring plot point,awful."
1,Boringly Bad,Trusted a friend's judgement & got this DVD from him. It is unbelievably bad. I sat through the whole movie even though I was tempted togo to bed as I thought everything will be clear in the end & the so-called twist will be fascinating & make up for the dull bits. Unfortunately I ended up with a bad movie on DVD & a friend whose judgement I don't trust anymore. Or was he just trying to get rid of his copy?
3,I didn't get it.,"I know this movie is a ""cult classic,"" and has gotten a lot of good reviews and all, but I just didn't quite get exactly what the message was supposed to be. It was interesting, and well acted, but the ending was just downright disappointing and left you with a ""what was that"" kind of feeling. The best part of this movie, by far, was the soundtrack. I would say rent this movie if you want to see what all of the hype is about, but I would not recommend buying it."
3,Pretty overrated,"I liked the movie--not sure why. I thought Drew Barrymore once again proved herself third-rate as an actress. But she is nothing to the movie, so I'll forgive it. If you want to see a movie that excels at psychological obscurity/clarity, rent or buy Jacob's ladder--and PAY ATTENTION! That movie will blow you away if you give it a chance. Obviously, I know there are huge differences between the two films, but they're not apples and oranges. Jacob's Ladder has affected many directors and writers, and you will see what I mean once you watch it--it is as underrated as Donnie is overrated. You'll thank me--promise!Jason Sipe, Hood Press Books,Tales of Madness: Seven Horror Stories by Edgar Allan Poe"
2,Imeanlikeok,"How you relate to this film probably depends on your proximity to California, judging by the ten minutes of space cadet commentary I listened to in order to find out what on earth happened at the end of this DVD (still none the wiser.) The afore-mentioned state is either airhead central or the Zen capitol of the world (nay universe) but I'm keeping mum. Despite the fact she never cooks.Kudos to the producers for fooling me into thinking this was a big budget disaster, rather than a small budget one. Down to the photography, I guess."
4,Watch the Movie - Pass on the Directors Commentary,"The DC of Donnie Darko shuffles the music around, adds a few new visuals, and includes some deleted scenes.The weakness of the DVD is the directors commentary. Long pauses along with rambling by co-commentator Kevin Smith adds nothing to the movie or the speculation about what Donnie Darko is about.Kevin Smith starts dropping F* Bombs left and right, a long side discussion of 80's director John Hughes, and overall stroking of each other's works renders the audio track worthless.If you already own DD then I suggest buying this cut only if you must see the deleted scenes."
3,This version doesn't have the entire soundtrack,"If you saw this movie in the theatrical release, and liked the music, you will be disappointed by the director's cut.It lacks most of the haunting score and some of the period songs have been substituted, such as the Echo and The Bunnymen song in the opening.There are also entire sequences from the original stripped of a score.The director cut also extends some scenes unnecesarily, such as the first night in the hotel.It is still a great film, but not as cool as the original.The second DVD has some good stuff on it. The #1 fan clip was funny, but not worth the extra $10.I am reselling this one and buying the original."
3,"Original ideas, average execution","I have just seen the official website of the movie. It does give a 'scientific' explanation.Now, knowing what actually happened in the movie, I can say that the idea was strikingly original, but the way it's executed is rather confusing. It could have been more clear, so that more viewers could understand it. Too bad, because the movie's theories on tangent universes are incredibly fascinating. A more experienced director would have made a classic with the same concept."
2,What went wrong?,"I thought that the original release of donie darko was the best movie I've ever seen, and I was looking foward to the directors cut, but once I saw it I was very disapointed to see how badly he butchered this fantastic film. Many of the key scenes were alterd, ruining some of the best moments in the film, and the eye ball thing that was added before incounters with frank was just plain retarded. Also this version was way too dumbed down, the showing of portions of the book as well as the added scene in the end with grandma death, told far too much. The original release really made you think, and took several veiwing for you to truely grasp everything, but this version lays everything out for you, turning one of the most complex movies I've seen into just your average ordinary run of the mill film. If you havent seen donnie darko yet go out and buy the original, and if you already own the original, this dvd will just disapoint you."
2,Not the same music,I much prefer the original. The music selection is a lot different and for me the music in the original set the tone. Most upsetting is the abscence The Church's song at the Halloween party. Otherwise it is the same movie with a few extra scenes and extra sci-fi fillers.
5,??WHOA??,"This movie is excellent!! I saw this movie while i was over at a friends house and at first hardly anyone wanted to watch it becuase its sounds so lame... we were all raggin and just making fun of this movie before we even started to watch it but after it started after about 10 mins everyone was quite and got into the movie, no one moved, our eyes were stuck to the tv... this is one movie that grabs you and pulls you in!! and after the movie ended everyone just sat there and didn't move, because we were all thinking about this movie and then at the same time most of us went WHOA...lol. because its so capitvating!! and the ending is ..whoa... if you haven't seen this movie you gotta watch it!! it'll blow ur mind"
5,"again, again, again","Donnie Darko is an excellent movie, and I cannot imagine watching it in a shorter version; and I hope no one decides to make an ill-advised sequel. I still have to watch it again (for the ? time) to catch more of the layered storyline."
5,First time watching it and I'm hooked!,"I had heard of this movie from various sources so I decided to buy it and see what all the fuss was about. Now I know! At first I thought it was just odd, then the pieces started coming together and the full story hit me and I was blown away. It is rare that a movie makes you think even a little bit nowadays, but this one does. It had me thinking well after the movie was over. I would definitely recommend it to any sci-fi or fantasy fans."
5,It's a happy movie,Donnie's dies to save Gretchen. He is Donnie Jesus Darko.But the thing that will really puzzle your noodle later on is:Would she have died if he didn't try to save her?
4,"Very good, but........","I'm suspect of the ridiculous hype this offbeat time-travel film has received. Yeah, the plot is a mind-bender and several viewings does clear up a few confusing points. Yeah the acting is superior and Maggie looks great. Yeah it has ""cult fave"" all over it; but just because it takes a few chances and defies a category doesn't mean it is a seminal or stellar piece of cinematic history.The portrayal of the 80's is spot on and sparked a quick trip down memory lane. Jake really took the role and ran with it. He must've been exhausted after putting so much effort into this character. A truly noteworthy job.I gave the movie 4-stars. It's worth a purchase if only to assure the chance for several viewings."
1,Overrated,"I wouldn't necessaryily consider this movie a 1 star, but i need to balance out all the hype munching simpletons that continue to give this movie perfect scores for reasons unrelated to it's actual merit. Just because a strategically marketed movie has a plot that doenst conform to normal Hollywood formulas doenst make it a good movie. THe same people that buy this stuff are the same people who eat up Garden State and Requiem for a Dream."
1,I can't believe I bought this movie,Boring and pointless. I normally avoid movies with Drew Barrymore in them and I wish I'd avoided this one. Don't waste your time or your money.
1,Awful,"Terrible acting, no pacing, incoherent tone, incoherent script, obscenely self-important and humorless (except for a patheticly Tarantino-esque pop-cult conversation about Smurfs)...What is the appeal of this movie beyond the hype? I honestly don't get it.It must be over my head..."
1,BAD MOVIE.,"I really wants to see this movie, but when I see it what a silly, don't make any sense and with that stupid bunny crap they put in that movie makes it really B.S...only thing I like about this movie is soundtrack. Because I grew up in 80s and loved the 80s music in this movie. For just the songs I gives it ONE STAR. But movie is stinks and stupid .don't waste ur money ."
5,Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut,"I actually bought this without seeing the Director's Cut first, having only seen the theatrical release. The theatrical release alone had made me cry, but that might have been issues I was having at the time. Regardless, Donnie Darko is an excellent, mind-bending movie that makes you think. The Director's Cut gave further illumination to the context of the story. Not necessarily one to watch with the kids, but a brilliant movie, either way."
5,Donie Darko is an awesome film,"I recently bought Donnie Darko as it was suggested to me by a friend. I have thanked that friend.Donnie Darko is a beautifully directed film, with a thick storyline that is compelling and completely unpredictable. It's so different from any other film, there really is no way of classifying it. This is an incredible film and strongly suggest it to all, although some parts may disturb younger viewers, but it is amazing.I watch a lot of films, which means I now predict just about every second of each new, boringly predictable film. This is completely different.100% strange100% beautiful100% originalA true classic, must watch"
3,Dane Cook Fans,"Dane Cook Fans, this one's for you! I'm talking about the fans that consider themselves somewhat intellectual or ""different.""I heard the hype from so many, and purchased this used. After watching it I realized most of the hype was simply based on the momentum of gossip. The movie while being a dark is shot in a kubrick-esque way but lacks worth-while time spent.I'd say this is perhaps one of the most over rated less-known films I've come to know, in a long time. lol This movie did manage to make me miss Kubrick that much more and consider buying the Blu-Ray version of Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut.. Peace"
2,Not brilliant,"I bought this based on the reviews you have read below mine. What a disappointment.Convoluted and complex, it leaves the viewer confused and dissatisfied. What is the point of the phone number on his arm, what does Drew Barrymore's character add to the story? Maybe I am missing the finer points of the intricate plotline, but then again, the key feeling I felt at the end was one of apathy... I did not particularly care.The ending is obvious, and not a surprise. Granted this is better than Final Destination, but if that is the benchmark, then we can all find better things to do in 'approximately 98 minutes.'One to watch if you must... not buy. Avoid, unless you are an undying fan of 'Sixth Sense' in which case I would redirect you to the black and white classic, 'Dead of Night' which is infinitely superior to this."
2,A waste of time! 10th july 2004.,"I have to say, this movie isn't very good at all. My favorite actress Drew barrymore produces the film, and she is an awsome actress and producer,but it is the actual film itself that is weird and boring. This may seem boring for some people, i'd hire it first, i wasted money on it and i hate it. I bought it cos i thought drew was donnie! p.s www.brianpointon isn't my nickname, kat isx"
1,Annoying,I couldn't wait for this film to finish. Imagine comparing this film to Stir of Echoes. Not even in the same league. Don't spend a lot of money on it.
3,People are tools,"...I saw it as the story of a trouble youth told in a way lashing out at society. For example, all of Donnie's acts of arson are done because Frank tells him to, but he only sees Frank when he's whacked out on his meds. (much like how ritilin is dished out to any and every ""trouble-maker"" in grade school.)Interpret the ending as you see fit. Was it all just in Donnie's mind? Look at the jet engine being hauled away and notice the strange red swirl, almost as if it were dreamt up. Buy the DVD I guess, maybe the commentary can shed some light on the matter. (I think the matter would best be left up to individual interpretation. Movies like Donnie Darko force you to THINK. ... I guess I have to make my own mold"")..."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Perfect condition, already knew it was a movie I loved. The director's cut, as always, is so much better than any other version. Perfectly intake, box not crushed in shipping process."
4,Excellent if a little all over the place.,"Excellent look at the subject matter. One reading this book needs at least passing knowledge of all three wars, and I felt his treatment of the English Civil War was a little quick, but all in all very good and very enlightening."
2,A real disappointment.....,"As a listener to Kevin Phillips' commentaries on NPR, I was ready for a good read. This is one of the most boring books I have ever picked up. Phillips goes on, and on, and on....his thought process is sound, the material is interesting, but this would have made a really good, 40 page essay. Somewhere around page 300, I said aloud, ""ENOUGH, ALREADY!""Try again, Kevin. Next time, think about coming to the point a little sooner."
4,An eye opener,"If you're looking for a quick read this is not it. I found the history fascinating and how the English Civil War has laid the foundation for the society we currently live in. The current debate over whether the Star & Bars should fly over the South Carolina state house makes complete sense to me and the responses that each of the presidential candidates has given, framed by their geographical heritage. All in all a very worthwhile read."
5,Better than expected,"This compilation does not have the same predictable production of ""CASIO ECHOS"" and ""REVERB"" that haunt most projects labelled ""NEW AGE/ SPIRITUAL MUSIC"".The entire 55 minutes on this CD are drenched in an atmosphere of musical serenity that relax listeners and will make them become an avid fan !Even if you're not a fan of NEW AGE MUSIC, give this CD a try.You may just discover something new !"
5,Must have for Bear Fans!!,My 7 month old and I discovered Bear in the Big Blue House this summer and we can't get enough! This CD is a great selection of songs from various episodes. My daughter loves to dance and every song gets her to shake her bon bon! We are having some confusion...she can't understand why Bear isn't on TV when we play it.
4,Trivia flip book---all about movies!,"This book has all the nitty-gritty questions about movies, from past to present from the mundane to the utterly impossible! Made in a convenient, although sometimes annoying flip book style."
5,great album,"a great album with wonderful musicthese guys are just greatloved all the songsbut i had a problem with the recording of a track , i don't have the album with me now , so i think it's track 4 or 5(...)"
5,GREAT,"GREAT MOVIES, GREAT PACKAGING. SIMPLY AWESOME ! if your a fan of horror movies, i would recommend both of these. funny, witty, and campy"
5,FAKE SHEMP,"I already reviewed the Evil Dead 2 - Book of the dead 2 as a single edition, just wanted to add that there is a region 2/EUROPE+JAPAN/, version available with English DTS 5.1 sound, released in CZECH Republic by Bonton Home Video /also in Poland rel.by Vision/, it has 1 making of /about 30min./, commentary, trailer. It was released by end of 2004 /beginning of 2005/, I am not sure, I think it was Dec.2004.Just one more: Book of the Dead 2 is made in CHINA."
5,We Are Having A Blast!,"One of my four sons received this for Christmas and we have been having a blast with it! The box got thrown out before I read the directions so I simply went on the Crayola website and watched the demo. We have the locking problem that it seems like everyone is having but a screwdriver pops it right open. Obviously the lock could have been better designed but.... Overall, we are having a lot of fun with this and have made tons of really cool cars! If you use enough crayon, the body ""snaps"" onto the chasis and doesn't come off until you take it off. It's important to be patient and wait until the body is completely cool before trying to take it out of the mold. It's a good lesson for four little boys :-)"
1,CRAPola not CRAYola,"Do not waste your money. The thing locked down and hasn't yet unlocked. The wax melted nicely, but it only filled the mold half way (using the recommended amount of broken crayons). And despite triple checking that the mold was tightly together, the melted wax proceeded to melt through the car. Luckily had the foresight to stick it on newspaper instead of the rug. Don't know what the ""car"" is like though--haven't managed to break our way into the machine to get it out. What a sad waste of money. And a couple of rather disappointed kids."
1,Save your money!!!,"I have never written a bad toy review before, but this is a necessity. I was very excited about giving this toy to my six-year-old for Christmas. We are on day five now, and we have yet to get the thing to make a car. The crayons do not melt correctly, so we even tried chopping them into tiny pieces prior to melting. Still no car. I have always trusted the name Crayola before, but I will certainly thing twice before buying again. This was a total disappointment for my entire family. So, save your time, money and frustration for a worthwhile toy."
1,gadget headz crayola car-- beware of this!!,"....Would not recommend this toy for any age!! Crayon wax leaks from the bottom of this! I don't know if ours was defective, but it didn't function properly at all!"
1,A Complete Rip Off!,"Santa brought this toy to both my 5 year old son, and another one to my 7 year old nephew. Neither units work. We have yet to get one car made. The units keep locking, even when you're not using the machine! The lights indicating each stage of the process did not work, so we had to just watch the time and perform the pouring and mold stage without being alerted. When you finally got the car out of the mold it cracked all up trying to get the car on the chasis. This product needs to be recalled!I've never been so disappointed in a toy in my life! It obviously wasn't tested before it was put on the market. SAVE YOUR MONEY & DON'T BUY THIS TOY!"
1,SANTA's MODERN VERSION OF COAL,"""Santa"" delivered this for our 2 boys. We haven't been able to make 1 decent car. Either the crayons don't melt enough, leaving you with half a car, or the car breaks apart before the boys got too play with it. I expected better from a big name company like this. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst ememy! I guess maybe this was ""Santa's"" modern version of coal?"
1,0 stars is more like it!,This is the biggest piece of junk that my kids ever received for a gift. It's hard to believe it sells for $20. The lid won't open when done. The wax never fills the mold enough. It makes a car noise the whole time that you CANNOT SHUT OFF. I can't believe Crayola put their name on this. We can't get one car out of it! Don't buy this!
5,A Great Training Book!!!!!,"The pictures in this book are wonderful! They are taken from all the right angels, and show you not only how it looks when done right, but also faults, which is VERY heplful. All the training tips are so well organized, with aims for the correct movements, as well as practical problems and solutions that you can try."
4,Good Yiddish dictionary,Herman Gelvin's 'Transliterated Guide to the Yiddish Language' is a very good dictionary for those who do not read Hebrew characters. It contains lenghty sections E-Y and Y-E and of every word gives the translation both in Roman characters and in 'oyshes'.
3,OK dictionary,"This is a very bare bones dictionary. When you look up a word, there's no context for understanding its meaning. However, if you can't read Yiddish characters, this is about as good as it gets. If you CAN read Yiddish, Weinrich's dictionary is the best. I use both--one to supplement the other. As to Amazon, they came thru with no problem."
1,Dies fast,"When I first purchased this device, it worked just fine. I like to feel of the stylus on the tablet surface because it feels like pencil on paper. The dimensions are perfect for my monitor. I don't have to worry about running out of space on the tablet. It's simple to use, but responds slow. The problem: I had it for about three months and now it won't work anymore. I have to continually uninstall and reinstall the drivers. The disk has outdated drivers for Windows 7 so I downloaded the drivers off of the website. It worked for a few hours, then wouldn't respond. Highly disappointing. The tablet will light when I tap the pen to it but the cursor won't move. It's not worth getting for the low price. You can spend less now, but in the long run you're paying more to purchase a new one. Might as well spend the extra buck for longevity."
5,Amazing.,"great quality, no problems, plug-and-play worked almost instantly. I tested this first on a Windows Vista machine with Paint. Worked really great and the quality is amazing! I work on a pretty high resolution (1152x864) and this little tablet has amazing accuracy, down to the pixel. I haven't had the slightest problem so far. I am now working on a frame-by-frame animation in Flash CS3 and it's going well."
1,I confirm other negative reviews,"As others mentioned, the software is positively antique. Upon installation, Windows XP gives dire warnings that the software is not XP approved/certified and could cause system instability. I went ahead and installed the drivers, and the system worked fine. However, the pen stopped talking to the table after less than a week, similar to the experiences of other reviewers."
2,Hated it.,"I'm going to give it credit that it's a cheap tablet and it's good to start out on, but I've had a lot of issues with the tablet... for instance the pressure sensitivity was awful and was really iffy. And after a year of owning it, I cracked the pen from all the use I got out of it. Once I got my cheap Wacom (which was a little bit smaller than this one) I threw this thing out.Good for just starting out and be very careful with it. It'll get the job done I guess."
2,"Worked for a few weeks, then died on me beyond repair.","I am a design student and bought this tablet for its excellent price. I read many reviews and they said it was good so I gave it a try. I regret it. I used it for a few weeks, nothing out of the ordinary happened. I had some pressure problems in Photoshop, but I fixed it soon enough. Then out of the blue, it stopped working! I tried everything.My brother bought a computer afterwards. Windows 7 didn't fix anything. I put the tablet away. A few months later I bought an iMac, and I tried there too. Nothing worked! The light just blinks and it does nothing else. I downloaded drivers, followed endless tutorials, used the CD it brought.I'm not saying it's a bad tablet, it's a troublesome tablet.Hope this saves some of you from spending [...] bucks on something that turn into a fossil."
3,Good enough for the price,"This is the first graphics tablet I've bought or used so I have no basis for comparison but here are the things I've noticed:1- the software is sketchy. Even their web site admits it's got a few problems. It needs to be updated immediately upon install and on my Windows xp system it never fully installed correctly. The result being that every time I plug the tablet in, it asks to be installed even though it's already performing.2- I'm not impressed with the tracking. I'm glad it's a large work surface because I just can't get used to the idea of the pen's position on the tablet corresponding to it's position on the screen. I'm used to a traditional mouse and pad and this is something to adjust to.So far it's a decent little tool/toy to play with. I'm still figuring out all it's curiosities, but overall I enjoy using it and it has made many aspects of digital drawing much easier for me."
3,It's okay,"It's okay, but a little hard to use the mouse on the tablet. It likes to not respond well to what you're doing. The pen works great, though."
4,It works in XP,"It works in Windows Xp. One of review warned it did not work in XP.I bought it about one week ago .I tried several times and failed in my home computer. I even submitted return request and was planning to return it. Just for fun, I tried it again in my office computer. Both are XP sp2.It worked great in Photophop and painter x.I decide to keep it.HOW I did it:1. download new driver from maker's website. Do NOT use the one in CD.2.After install, shut down your computer.3.Remove the mouse first. connect tablet to USB port.4.after reboot, login your windows and enjoy."
4,Does the job,Purchased this as a gift for my husband who is an artist and he enjoys using it on his projects.
3,Average Quality,"It works...not well. I would suggest for a child, perfect. For any real drawing, adult..not this one. No problem with it in over a year."
3,mousepen,"It does exactly as advertised. Not a great tool such as a wacom, but good for small things. Good price."
4,thank you,we are very pleased with the Genius mouse pen.Got it as a Christmas gift and the time it arrived in was very professional.Thank youV Steadman
4,Great for Photoshop,"I use this mostly for PS work, for which it is very useful at a really nice price. I don't need a professional grade tablet so this is a good choice."
4,Works great for the price!,"I wasn't expecting much from such a cheap tablet, but it's much better than smaller, more expensive store bought tablets I've owned. It does what it's supposed to, but you'll have to play with it a bit before you get your settings just right for normal use in Photoshop or whatever you may use it for.Great product for the money."
2,Low price and (unfortunately) low quality,It's cheap but unfortunately quality disappointed me. It's quite loud (you hear scratch sound during moving on tablet). And tip of pen is moving a little in all directions.I'm seriuosly thinking about returning this tablet and buying Wacom Bamboo (smaller but much better - I know because my friend has ordered it couple of days ago and I've tested it).
2,Well...,"This tablet worked well for the first week I had it. So, like an idiot, I threw all the packaging away and can't send it back. I turned my computer on one day and the pen wouldn't work, then the mouse wouldn't work. I changed the batteries. No change. I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. No change. I looked up the website for the tablet and they had a driver for Vista. So, I installed that. The mouse started working and the pen now only works in things like GIMP and Paint. Which I guess is alright, considering that's what I was going to use the pen for anyway, but it was kind of cool to use just the pen to do all the mouse functions.I have glitches with my mouse from time to time still. The pointer drags across the screen without the mouse moving a bit. Or it stops working altogether and I have to restart the computer. I might end up getting a Bamboo Fun at a later date when I've saved some money."
2,Please find the money to get a better tablet!,"I bought these for my digital imaging classroom. They don't compare to WACOM. We can only get one to work with any kind of pressure sensitivity. Perhaps with Vista they work, but not with Windows 2003 or Mac OSX. Really sad. Sent the unopened ones back and ordered WACOM. I highly recommend that you find the $ for WACOM Intuos3. Happy painting!"
1,"not compatable with ""MOST"" graphic software","I bought this for my daughter for xmas, she uses GIMP. Which sucks for us because when we couldn't get it to work Genius said ""buy Photoshop,"" (despite it indicating it works with ""most"") Uh, no. Not going to buy a $1K program for a 440 tablet. So, before you buy I suggest calling Genius or doing some searching into whether or not your software will work to save yourself hassle. Since this was a gift, we had it over 30 days, but Amazon worked with us to return it, which is good."
2,Pen Doesn't work under Gimp for Windows,"Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. Setup was easy but the pen does not work under Gimp. You can use the pen as a mouse to open file but it will not draw. Since I am not purchasing Photoshop, I had to return it."
4,I love it!,"I love my MousePen Tablet. Although at first I was a bit hesitant to buy this product because of the very low price, but I took the chance anyway. I'm glad I decided to buy it, I've had the tablet for 2 1/2 months now and it works like a charm. I highly recommend this tablet for beginners, I'm a beginner myself and this tablet was very easy to use. Within a few days after I recieved the MousePen, I got used it very quickly and immediately felt comfortable with the controls. This tablet is a good investment.*NOTE* You might come accross some minor problems like the pressure sensitivity (which is basically drawing a thin line by applying light pressure on the pen, or drawing a thick line by applying a lot of pressure on the pen) not working. Just install an updated version of the driver from the internet. I've had that problem, and after I installed the updated driver I haven't had any other problems since."
5,Price and features perfect for home use,"We now own two of these, one for more than a year. Much cheaper than other tablets of this size, it is perfect for home use. Kids use it for various school projects. To be fair I haven't really tried more expensive tablets, but I can't imagine how they can be more useful than this one."
3,"Works fine, loaded with spyware","I was only looking for a basic a tablet. I think this serves the purpose. It doesn't look very sturdy. I don't find the pressure tip very comfortable. To put it simply, it doesn't feel like writing with a pen at all.What really annoyed me was the fact that the software that it came with was loaded with all kinds of spyware. Almost made my PC grind to a halt. Be very watchful with what you install from the CD. I think the drivers were clean, but I think the free software was the trojan horse."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH DUAL MONITORS,"If you are using dual monitors, do not buy this product. My tablet will not work on dual monitors and when I called Genius technical support they said, ""I'm sorry, none of our products are licensed for dual monitors."" Yuck! I invested a lot of money in my 24"" monitor for working with graphics, and now its useless unless I buy a better graphics tablet.I am very disappointed with this product!If any other readers have a solution to this, please post a comment. Thank you."
1,DOA,"indeed, doesnt even work.this is an email i sent to genius support:Hi,i just received my tablet today, and i cant seem to be able to get it to work.i installed the drivers, as the booklet said, but upon connecting the tablet i receive an error saying:""Power surge on hub port"" (i attached a screen shot)and on a second computer, nothing happens.and this is the reply:Hello,I regret to inform you that there may have been a short circuit on the internal circuit board when you plugged the product into the 5V USB port. Please return product to place of purchase for replacement.dont bother..if it doesnt work on day 1, it'll probably break again."
1,Don't waste your time,Get a Wacom - yes more money but the pen on my Genius just doesn't work! The mouse is fine and I like the size of the pad. But I should have got the Wacom!
4,Wonderful Tablet,"I've got this tablet a couple of months ago and it's really good for editing pictures, digital painting and just have fun writing with your own hand writting.This product is really confortable to use bacause of the big drawing area compared to the wacom ones in similar price range.It's a solid product and has a lot of pressure levels, so you can paint in photoshop with a lot of different opacities and/or brush size changes, depending on the brush option and the pressure you apply.I just wish the cable was retractible, and it was more thin, so i could bring it anywhere, but after that, it's a solid product."
4,Good one for the price you pay.,"I bought the tablet & pen primarily to add hand sketches to documents. I also foresee the pen for the applications for my kid. This one was a good piece for the price I paid. Working area is larger & it is possible to mask the screen area to the board for working.Works pretty well for selections & other minimum operations as a mouse. Not a replacement for a 3 button scroll mouse when using CAD applications.Overall, I like this item."
5,Excellent Art Tool,This is a terrific art tool. I bought it for my sister and she uses it everyday. She loves it!
1,Genius tablet,I needed a tablet to write on powerpoints was unable to do this with it. Support was of no help at all. Had to call several times at one time told the whole department was at lunch!!!
3,Acceptable.,"Bought this as a gift for a friend. He had a LOT of trouble getting this to work at first. I told him to get a hold of the company that makes it and he said that they almost immediately just offered to send him a pen, like they already knew what he was calling about. It still didn't work for a while, and then he figured out something in the settings that was conflicting with the operation of it. Now, it seems to work fine. I don't know about the hotkeys or the mouse, but for something for him to just play around on, it seems that he's pleased."
1,Problems with Genius MousPen 8x6 Graphic Tablet,"I am very disappointed with this product and Im ready to return it. It disabled automatic macros when I open a word enabled macro document, and I now have msg error msgs that I cannot figure out. Also, for some reason that I cannot determine, I no longer have audio sound on my laptop. It is not working properly, and have to perform a system restore in order to fix. I didnt have these problems before I installed the software, and I installed the product based on the instructions. If anyone else has gone thru this, pls let me know an easy way to fix. Otherwise, I will return as originally planned."
1,genius mousepen ok but not so genius,"its a nice novelty but it really doesnt work the way you think it should so far into the technology revolution. not really smooth and very jerky. i installed it on two computers. one xp and one vista. same results on both. i thought this would allow me to handwrite entrys into office applications but it really doesnt do that very well. i thought it would let me handsign company documents but it looks all jerky, like a 10 year old did it. drawings are stilted and the pad messes you up alot of times. the stupid buttons on the pen are in a way bad spot and click accidentally, all the time. the mouse i cant get to work in any way. overall its amusing and that is about it."
3,Nice disposable tablet.,"This tablet worked great for 3 months, then died. I took very good care of it and was very careful because I had heard they weren't very reliable/well made.Installing the drivers was fine as long as you don't use the installation CD and skip directly to the website. It also sucked batteries dry pretty quickly, but that was to be expected. I would prefer something that didn't use batteries at all.You definitely get what you pay for in this case. If you can afford it, buy a WACOM even if you have to go smaller. For $50 I can't complain too much about this particular tablet."
4,Works Well!,"I am very pleased with this Mouse Pen, the pen works very well and I like the easy to use mouse too! For the price I paid, it was a bargain. I like the pressure sensitive pen and found it made editing photos much easier."
4,New User,"I have always wanted to try a pen mouse, and for the price, I'm happy with this one. The work space is big enough to draw or edit photos with ease, and you can adjust the work area smaller if you need to. Great value for around $50."
2,There's a reason it's cheap,"I've had this tablet for nearly 3 years now. The review was prompted by its untimely death - it can no longer be recognized correctly by any computer. So, here are some other details:+ It is a pen+tablet, and it works for that, on a basic level.+ Standard AAA battery in the pen- The pentip is not securely attached inside the pen, kind of wobbling around a bit, so it is difficult to properly and precisely control its placement and pressure.- The tablet sometimes fails to properly track the pen when it's moving.- The tablet randomly loses the ability to detect the pen at all, requiring that a button on the pen be pressed to re-establish the connection to the tablet.- It evidently may be prone to simply dying after a few years of very infrequent use.It's a Harbor-Freight-grade of product - something to get if you need a cheap solution that'll work for one or two tasks, but just don't expect much more than that out of it."
4,fits and wiggles,"This is the forth tablet I have owned in 10 years. Two of the others were Wacom, This tablet happens to actually be identical to one of the Wacom's I had. the same thing goes band in all of them: the cable at the edge of the tablet. I have not yet found a successful repair but at 40 bucks for a new one of the Gemini every few years, who cares. It responds in they ways I need them to and I do extensive photo-shop work. I never bother for add on button on my tablets though so you as a reader should know that disclaimer. If those are important to you you may want the fancier models, otherwise for crying out loud its forty bucks try the dang thing and if you don't like it use it as a back up when your 300 dollar Wacom starts giving you fits."
5,Excellent Drawing Tool,"Contents:- Tablet- Digital Pen- Wireless Mouse- Driver Software/Tablet Software CD-ROM- Bundled Software (Adobe Photoshop Extended - Trial, Corel Painter - Trial)- 2 spare pen tips & Tip remover- 2 AAA Batteries (1 for the pen and one for the mouse)Installation and Set-upYou must install the drivers before attaching the tablet to your PC. Overall the installtion is very easy. Once the drivers are installed, you must restart your PC.USAGE:I tested this software with Paint, and it is a breeze to draw and/or copy works of art. The tablet is configured to the position of the cursor on the screen. The position of the pen is even detected while it is just a few millimeters above the surface of the tablet. Thereofre it can be used instead of a mouse. The pen has 2-button on it that makes it function like a mouse as well.Conclusion:A valuable piece of equipment for any digital artist that doesn't have the resources for a large investment."
2,It worked fine... until it stopped working,"I was looking for a tablet only for writing, and this one seemed like a good option. It worked just fine for 2 months, and then it wouldn't work sometimes. It looks like a wire problem, because if I move the usb cable enough I get it working for some minutes.I know this is a cheap alternative for tablets.. but 2 months of a lifetime?"
4,very pleased,I bought this for my sister for her website and she likes it alot. I am very pleased with how happy it made her.
3,You get what you paid for,"The tablet sensor works well, but I've found that after a while the pen tip starts getting stuck and the right click button in the pen becomes less sensitive, I've had to press it really hard sometimes to make it work.All in all, I guess it's not supposed to be professional stuff."
1,Spyware infection thanks to this product..,"I picked up the 8x6 as a cheap tablet for my home pc. When it arrived the pen and mouse didn't want to function. I headed to the Genius web site and when I arrived at their US site, a window appeared looking to run an application. I said no and it still installed WinReanimator (Russian spyware) causing major havok. Be warned!"
1,Chintsy - Poor support,"If you're serious about using a tablet, do NOT buy this one.NONE of Genius's tablets support multiple monitors. They say it is a ""licensing"" issue. Yeah, right.Overall, this does have a cheap feel to it, but it is inexpensive. But the mouse is smaller than a standard mouse, so I don't plan to use it. The biggest problem is that the stylus only works on the primary monitor, and anyone with multiple monitors will tell you that they don't EDIT on that one because of all the O/S stuff on that monitor.Besides, you can't use the included software (like Annotate on Word), unless of course you want to do EVERYTHING on your main monitor.If they had mentioned on the product specifications that it only works on one monitor, I would not have bought it in the first place."
1,great at first,"this was so great in the beginning, but after 1 month, it malfunctioned! it wouldnt work on my computer and when it did work (for about 30 minutes) the stupid thing wouldnt click anything! its a piece of junk, save ur money!!"
1,Not suitable for modern Windows computers,"I really wanted this item to work. But the 5-year-old drivers with no updates from geniusnet.com made it impossible.The drivers crashed my Windows XP HP desktop with the dreaded ""Windows has recovered from a serious error"" message. After downloading replacement drivers from the manufacturer's website with the same result, I did the uninstall (followed by a registry purge using JV16 to remove 3 remaining fragments) and had it back in the box for return within the hour.Only good thing about it was the nice packaging which made the return easy. Sort of a waste of good packaging, though, for a product that doesn't work."
2,NOT FOR MAC OX S + Bad Customer Service and Cheap Product.,"I bought this to use for a new Mac. Once it came not only was the product cheaply made and not ""solid"" like other pen tablets, the US Customer service was not very helpful (the product and company is Korean I believe). They did not supply a driver for the new Mac and when I called they said ""oh our Mac here in the office is a few years old, so we don't know if it works on newer Macs"". They did not have the expertise to show me how to get a driver, nor did they seem to care. For Mac people using this for CS3 stay away!"
5,This is great,I bought this for my son becasue he is now into Manga. He loves the product. He loves the fact that it is so slim and i think it is a great prodcut for a wonderful price. I would reccommend this product to anyone.
4,Genius MousePen 8X6 Graphic Tablet for Home and Office,"I really enjoy using this product, the install driver did not give me any problems, and it reads pressure quite well. The mouse that it came with is pretty useless because I'm used to the way my old mouse works for some things, but I didn't buy the product for the mouse so that doesn't really matter to me.The buttons on the pen itself are a bit ""sticky"" but since actual clicking is done with tapping I don't mind so much, it's just that sometimes when you go to trigger scrolling, the button won't actually click down, but since scrolling and right-clicking is not the purpose of the product it bothers me very little.Oh, and remember to change the battery when you get it, the pre-installed battery is already dead.Overall I give this product four stars, because even though it has a couple of kinks it gets the job done and overall fulfills what is looked for in a pen tablet for the price that it is at."
1,The mouse has no purpose!,"What I expected was: a tablet that has a pen, and a wireless mouse that is usable as a plain old mouse. Well, what this includes is: a tablet that uses either a pen or that mouse. The mouse is *not* usable off of that tablet. The mouse and the pen are interchangeable as a method to position the pointer on the pad.This is idiotic. I returned it immediately and got another product:Wacom Bamboo Pen Tablet"
1,These folks are behind the times....and support is lacking,"Genious? You have got to be kidding! They have not figured out that Vista is a factor in the market. The tablet works with Vista......but had to ferret out the problems myself as tech support was incapable of offering any suggestion. In addition, the software shipped with the product will not work with Vista and the only response I got was ""have to check with Taiwan""......and Taiwan must not have e-mail connection to their own U.S. offices...as there has been no follow-up of any kind. Buy from these people at your own peril........they have shown incompetence and no interest in supporting what they sell. Don't buy this unless you want to be totally on your own. Disgusting!"
1,D.O.A.,"I so wanted this product to work and purchased this at Amazon's $39.00 special price. However, it was Dead on Arrival (DOA). I'm very computer savvy but couldn't get this thing to do a single thing. Even tried changing the battery in the pen . . . nothing. I have no doubt that it may be working for others. I think I'll spend the money and get what you pay for in a higher end product."
4,"Well, it's not the best...","I've used a friend's tablet, and I have to say Wacom is still the best. This one is pretty good. It hasn't caused any problems or damage to my computer, yet, but it is hard to control. This makes it almost impossible to create your own font or make a picture with lots of fine detail without training yourself to use it for a long time. I think it's an alright product, though. It's great if you are looking for a mouse for your laptop and are also looking for a tablet, but I think lots of tablets come with them, any road."
4,Genius is a genius,"Thanks to a previous review on this graphic tablet, I was able to set up with only a minimum of confusion. Had it not been for subject review, I would have given up before I could make the tablet usable. The instruction manual that comes with the Genius is not user friendly. Once I had it set up it works great and saves my wrist from a lot of pain when editing multiple old photos which I have been digitizing to create a DVD of a family history of my parents. Much more practical for the casual user than the higher priced tablets. So... if you purchase the Genius, be sure to check out the earlier review that outlines how to set it up, print it out and keep it to use when you receive your tablet from Amazon!"
3,Not very satisfied,"I owned this product for a year and then all of a sudden it stopped working. I never dropped it, I didn't change computers, it didn't sit out in the rain, it just quit working for me. The pen wasn't very sensitive and started wearing away after some use. Well I bought it because it was on sale, and I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not worth the money,"This pen tablet is worthless. For the first couple of days, it seemed to run fine, and there were hardly any problems. The mouse shuts off after awhile when it isn't in use and I would have to click on the pen to get it to work. No big deal. That's how it saves battery power. ...Or so I thought. After about a week of use, the tablet would shut down permanently and I was forced to constantly restart the PC in order to get it working. That only temporarily solved the problem. Now, whenever It stops working, all I can do is restart the whole system. This thing is trash. Avoid it at all costs unless you're looking for a nice wide paper weight."
3,doesn't last,"Bought this product about 1 and a half years ago. I used it for CG. It's generally okay for someone like me who aren't professional artists and new to digital tablets. It took some getting used to at first. Works fine except that the pen nib rattles a little and didn't seem sturdy. I switched to markers after a while working with this tablet, and used it more as a mouse pad. When I picked up the pen again after setting it aside a while without using, it stopped working. (I changed new batteries). Don't know why, but I guess it's just being upset that I don't like it as I did before.It's good for the price, but if you work a lot with digital tablets, or if you expect something that lasts, I would suggest you invest money into something more expensive and has a better quality than this tablet."
5,Splendent,"First I have to say that it was pretty cheap, on sale, which made me save money. Being an 8x6 tablet is perfect to place anywhere to draw on, though the cable that is around 56' of length. Great delivery time, got to my house in three business days. Gots the occational glitch or just turns itself off but works pretty well, i do recomend getting a soft ware pogram for drawings or something in that area. But over all great product."
5,My first tablet - love it,"So far so good. Works as stated and for my needs was well worth the money. Wacom was just too expensive for me, a beginner. I am happy with this tablet."
3,Great product for the price.,"I haven't tried many Graphic Tablets but this one is definitely worth the price. It works much better than I expected (There are tablets that cost 10-20 times as much as this one so I figured it wouldn't be too reliable). The only precaution is the pressure sensitivity doesn't work with my PC, but when hooked up to a mac it works great."
1,Not so happy!,"Haven't been able to get it to work with Windows XP! I downloaded updated drivers from the genius sit and purchased new fresh batteries. Not knowing how long it may have been setting on the shelf before I received it. It would be nice if the Pen and mouse had and L E D light to let you know they have power. The manual isn't very good seems just as I get to the last few steps and go to the next page They change the language to one I am not fluent in. I'll have to try a different vendor. Have to admit I find Windows often requires installing, un installing and re installing several times is usually required to get things to work. Would also be nice if the battery loaded more like a flash light. unscrew the end and drop in the batteries. The battery holder in the pen is quite flimsy and not easy to replace the battery"
4,Genius Mouse Pen and Graphic Tablet Review,I purchased the Genius Mouse Pen and Graphic Tablet for my 17-year-old daughter. This is the second one that we have purchased. It is a great product. My daughter is an artist and animates and draws using this pad. The reason we bought a second one was due to a wire coming loose; this was not the fault of the product but lack of care of the wire on my daughter's part. We bought a second one as we were very happy with the first. It is easy to set up and great for the casual user but for someone who is an artist it is more than adequate.
4,Genius Tablet Review,I like the Genius Tablet. Right out of the box after the software install it worked great. I use it to make designs for embroidery and the first day I made two designs. It is easier than with the mouse. I would recommend this product. The price was great also.
3,Tablet review,The pen stlye tablet is okay for kids but I don't recommended for adults since its difficult to control the mouse. My two boys find the tablet great since they use for online tutoring. The only problem I have the unit is that the pen or mouse are not sold separately. I had to buy a complete set since my son did something to the pen. The overall is okay not great.
5,Great Pen Tablet,"I love this pen tablet. It works great and what a great price. This is my first pen tablet so I do not have another one to compare it to, but I am very pleased with this product. It works great, was easy to set up and it was ready to go right away. The pen is very senistive and easy to use. It is a little bit of an adjustment for me to use the pen verses years of using the traditional mouse, but I can do more things with the pen then I ever could with a mouse. I am an artist and photographer and it is a great tool to use in my graphics work."
2,"Great, until it died.","I bought this tablet about a year ago, and it worked fine until about 3 or 4 months or so ago.At this point, the mouse started to jump, or not work, even with a replacement of batteries. The pen also was not as effective.I conclude, this was a great tablet, until it stopped to work. I might be more satisfied, however, if Genius did not leave almost no trail. I could find no way to contact them and express my displeasure. I would say no to buying another Genius brand tablet, and I suggest to anyone that a Wacom brand tablet (at http://www.wacom.com) seems like a better investment. I have not tried one, but I soon plan to."
2,Poor service from ANTonline,"I received the device & I tried to set it up on my computer. I found the installation instructions very confusing & I could not get it to work. After spending a good deal of time trying to set it up, I decided to return the item to the seller, ANTonline. It just wouldn't work on my computer. I contacted ANTonline and they rejected my request to return it. Basically their message implied; ""you bought it and now your stuck with it"". I will not do repeat business with ANTonline in the furure."
1,received quickly,"I can not get the table icon to appear on my tablet, what am I doing wrong? I have downloaded the driver provided, my mouse works (LED light) but nothing coming up on tablet.need help"
2,No instructions?,"Maybe I'm the last person to buy a tablet, but i was hoping for more instruction on using this tablet. Cheap, does what it claims, but all learning was through trial and error and web research. It wouldn't have been hard for the company to include an instruction booklet, in the box or on line.Just an fyi."
3,Works OK. I'm satisfied.,"Works okay. Sensitivity is OK. The button broke after a week, which sucked after dealing with getting used to using it."
4,Great item for a great price!,"I was a bit unsure at first, but this product was definitely worth the buy. I'm not sure how it works for MAC users, but it works wounderfully for XP and Vista. My only problem is that the Stylus won't read until I start up photoshop on my XP. But on a Vista, the system reconfigures perfectly for it.Wacom has better quality tablets, but the size and features on the Genius beats it hands down with the price. Any other company would sell for maybe $300+.I HIGHLY recommend getting it if you're after your starter tablet, or if you just don't have much money to spend."
3,Left Handers Beware: Way too sensitive.,"I read the reviews for this tablet, and they seemed fantastic. Now, I'm not sure if this goes for ANY tablet, but I'm left handed and it was EXTREMELY difficult to use, because the pen drew just by me moving my hand to write from left to right. The tablet is very sensitive, and I could hold the stylus inches away and it would still write. Perhaps it would be fine for a right handed person, but I found it very irritating. It does not work well in Photo shop, I can draw better with a mouse! Perhaps just me, but left handers, beware. Also, I thought the stylus was uncomfortable to use(you have to hold a button down to use it). I was actually surprised by the results of this tablet, lots of people swear by them...they must not be left handed.Other than that, the tablet is a good size, software works well, and its a good prize. It's just WAY WAY WAY too sensitive."
5,Yes!!,"For such a cheap price,you'd think that this would be a horrible product. WRONG! The tablet handles well, and works with many systems and programs. It's been ideal for digital coloring and just messing around with friends. Unknown to me, people I go to college with made sure to purchase this item as well! Genius doesn't let down with this product, as it is better then a Wacom by all means. I even plan on buying it for my boyfriend. Package arrived earlier then expected too, wow!"
3,Nice item,"This is a handy item if you have a lot of coloring. You can rest by using the pen to color your large spaces. However, it was not what I expected with which to write. This was eratic, much too large, and therefore a useless writing implement. I would invest in one of better value and quality, not this one, if you really need one."
5,Love it,I bought this tablet for the low price since it was cheap and Im so glad I did Because I love this tablet to death. I've never used a wacom before and now I wont have too. It does everything it was designed to do.
2,Faulty from the start,"I had problems from the start but began finding ways to work around them, but now I see I should have returned this asap. The pen has died completely (Yes, I've changed the batteries.)From the beginning it had a hit and miss.When it works, it works fine, but don't expect anything amazing. I'd been warned prior to this.The tablet is made quite well, but the pen is poorly made and feels cheap."
4,Really good if it's your first tablet,I ordered the tablet to help my son with his animations. He says that the animations he makes are a lot more smoother and they're more presentable. It's a lot easier to draw on the computer with it instead of using a mouse. The only problem he's encountered with it so far is that the computer would sometimes crash if the tablet is connected to it before starting up. He found out that the only way to prevent it is to wait until the computer loads before connecting the tablet to the computer. This product is excellent and is great for a first tablet.
4,I'm happy with it,"I bought this in December because I was taking a computer graphics class during the Spring semester. I can't imagine having to do graphics without it. I do use it for other tasks as well when I think it will make it easier.I never tried the mouse that comes with it, as I have no use for it. I'm a trackball person.The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have an easel or legs to angle it. It looks like it does in the pictures. I really wish it did. This is my reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5.After reading some of the recent comments, I thought that I should add that I am using Windows XP and have no problems using the tablet in general or with Photoshop."
3,Good First Tablet,"This is the first pen/tablet I've purchased, and I am pleased with the product. Installation was easy, product works perfectly (running Windows XP SP2/3) and even included batteries in the box.Using the pen relieves the pain I occasionally have in my mouse hand from repetitive stress. Haven't used it for drawing in Photoshop yet, but I did test out the pen tip, and the pressure sensitivity is pretty cool, too.Customization of the tablet is nice - you can assign functions to various 'buttons'. Only change I've made so far is to change the pre-programmed email button from Outlook Express to Outlook 2003.I still use my mouse for gaming, but for general productivity the tablet is great."
1,Do not waste your time or money,This is the most buddy POS I have purchased from Amazon. It may be useful for a kid but has no professional purpose what so ever. The mouse is erratic and neither it nor the pin can be used with precision. The software that comes with it looks like something from windows 98. Do not waste your time.
5,Great Value for the price,Genius MousePen 8X6 Graphic Tablet for Home and OfficeI have to say I wasn't sure about buying this item since there was a large difference in price between this graphics tablet and the wacom but once I recieved it and hooked it up I was amazed at how easy it was to use I still use my mouse more than not over the one in the kit but the pen is a nice addition to my desktop it does take some getting used to as far as eye and hand coordination goes but it helps to practice.So again a great value for the price.
4,no instructions for changing pen battery,the tablet does a good job for its affordable price.there were no instructions on how to change the pen battery. i broke the pen trying to insert a paper clip in one of its holes. genius tech support finally told me to just grab the two halfs of the pen and pull hard - that did the trick.
1,Piece of Crap,"Waited 10 days for it to show up. When it showed up I installed the software, and sort of got it working with the mouse, the pen only works in the upper left 1 inch of the tablet. PIECE OF CRAP, don't waste your money here. Buy something else that works. Hopefully I can get my money back from Amazon without waiting another month."
3,Art Board,"I bought this for my daughter who usually uses her laptop to do anime art. She had to get use to the new device and thought it would be easier if you could see what you were drawing on the pad itself. Just when she was getting the hang of it, it started to malfunction. She found a way to manipulate the USB wire so that it would work. It's an okay buy for the price, but I would have rather invested more money for a higher standard product perhaps with better features."
1,What the hell!,"This tablet worked one day for me, and now it doesn't even come on. I uninstalled it three times and my computer will not even notice it when I plug it in the usb port. Now I have to get a new one but I am getting a more expensive one so I know it will work."
1,graphic tablet,"I purchase this device because I Believe on those good review this product have for this G tablet. thinking it will be exellent as they say, but do not believe on those good reviews. this G.tablet is complete not too bad but still waste of time and money. even for the new low price .the pen and mouse are not accurate and piontless leave you in frustration at the end .not recomended"
1,Say No Thanks,"I haven't quite figured this item out yet or maybe there is nothing to figure out and it is just a lousy product. The pen doesn't work worth a darn, which is why I purchased it. The pen skips and is difficult to position. It has never made a mark in the right place at the right time. It is an exercise in frustration. There must be something better on the market for computer drawing! My advice would be to keep your money and try something else!"
3,disappointing,"The Corel Painter-The ultimate digital sketching and painting tool, is a trial version and expired after 30 days! I was very much looking forward to working with it."
5,Great for First Time Users,"Like many people, I was looking for something less expensive than the Wacom tablets. I just needed something to do sketches with because it was getting old arguing with my sisters to get off the computer in order to scan my images and this tablet seemed to be a mix of the right price and serving those basic needs.I haven't used it much, but it has been absolutely heavenly after finding the right sized brush on Photoshop (I use 100 pixel). I am working on a comic, so being able to go straight from sketching to final outlines is a huge convenience. And the lines I make feel incredibly natural as well. It was very quick to get used to.So while it may not have a big name printed on the front, it is great if you don't want to pay too much and are looking into some new technology.I also use this on Windows Vista if anyone is wondering if it will work on that system."
5,Tablet,OK - READ THE REVIEWS! I am using Windows XP & Photoshop CS4. DO NOT INSTALL CD! Just plug in tablet & it will automatically install. Works flawlessly & love it!
3,It's Good,"It's worth the money I paid for it. The pen isn't as smoothe as I had hoped, but for someone just starting out it's not a bad purchase for the price."
5,A complete eye opening event,Learn how from the cells of our body to the infinite cosmos there is the omnipresence of the face of God.
1,times tables?,The world does not need a reminder on multiplying by 1. That's the on thing my students can actually do.
5,Excellente Brazilian Music,"The band shows the Roots Reggae in its most simply way, with political lyrics. The vocalist has power and the players a lot of punch. The lead guitar player has a solo album very good."
2,UPDATE - Not so great after all,"UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:Bringing this one down from 5 to 2 stars due to constant reliability issues. I have had this receiver for under a year, and it is used very sparingly. 3 months since I bought it, all sound stopped one day. Took it in for a warranty repair, came back after 3 weeks with a part replaced. 8 more months, and we are back to square one but with a different problem - now it turns off automatically within 2 seconds of starting up. Back to the service center. Seems like there are some pretty unreliable parts in this receiver for the sparing use it is getting.Original Review:Great quality, sound, easy to set up.Bought this just a few days ago to drive my multi-room speaker system setup. Used banana plugs (purchased separately) for the speaker wires to easily connect in a restricted closet space. Worked flawlessly with great sound in all rooms, using am, fm and (external) cd inputs."
4,sherwoo rx5502,I've not had this product for very long but so far so goodI received it promptly and was able to set it up without issue.It picks up radio stations in my are very well. and with the sony book shelfspeakers I've had for years...sounds great.
4,Great reciever for a small price,"The price was right, shipping was very quick, very pleased. The only problem I encountered was it's a little difficult to connect the speaker wires to the back of the receiver, small area to work."
1,Stupid,"The volume was very low, no matter what that volume of the source was & once the volume reached 60, it would completely shut off. >:("
1,Letdown,"Sounded good at first, controls a little confusing, then it crapped out, apparently a common problem with this unit - see internet, many failures of this type."
4,Reciever - Sherwood,"I bought this reciever due to other reviews I read on it. Sherwood has been around for a long time and has a good product line. This reciever works well with my 5-CD changer and the sound is good. The volume seems to be low and I am constantly turning it up. The FM isn't like that, so who knows. I can play my music and that's what I wanted. I wish that they would make stero equipment that is a lighter color, instead everything is black on black. This reciever is easier than most to use."
4,Receiver works good,"We are happy with the Sherwood RX5502. It works fine, and does what it is supposed to do. The price is great, just a fraction of the price of our previous receiver (which wore out). It is hard to find a receiver today with analog connections labeled cassette and cd. Most receivers have digital connections for home theater, etc. We have had it two months and are happy with it."
3,Just what I needed,Fits the need and works great. will set up a set of speakers though the house and this will drive it. No problems with the system and works fine for the price.
5,Doggie chews,"I have been giving these supplements to my dogs for the last 4 years. One of my dogs had orthopedic surgery when she was about 4 years old and my vet recommended a daily joint supplement. My close friend, whom I call ""Dog Mother"" because she knows so much about dogs and their needs, recommended this product. My other dog is approx. 10-11 yrs old and has no physical disabilities. Both love these chews. I really feel that they benefit from this supplement because the one time I ran out, the younger dog's gait seemed to stiffen after normal exercise. Once back on the Synoviflex chews, the stiffness disappeared.Synoviflex Joint Care Soft Chews for Dogs by Vitality Systems (240-count tub - liver flavor)"
5,Great Product at Great Price,"I have a German Shepard that has had hip problems since she became part of our family. My Vet was having me give her two of these same chews going on three years now.I was purchasing them from my vet as I was believi ng it was a prescription product. I didn't mind the price as it was for a family member.I had seen these chews advertised on Amazon and compared them to what I was buying from my Vet. They were the same product, same manufactor, same everything except the cost and quanity.I ordered two containers of 240 chews each for the same price I paid for two containers of 120 chews from my Vet.Need I say more."
4,arthritis supplement,I liked the bulk purchase of this product. I am not sure if it helped the 13 year old Aussie shephards but it did provide extra nutrients. They made it to 14.5 and 15 years old. A friend swore by it so I had to try them.
3,Bizarre,"I am not sure whether I enjoyed the book or not. It is definitely engrossing, but none of the characters are very sympathetic. I didn't like any of them. There are alot of strange and useless plot twists that add nothing to the story. The plot line involving the missing person's uncle is entirely gratuitous. On the other hand, I was engrossed in trying to find out what happened to Jenny, so I read it to the end. I admit that I was surprised by the conclusion."
4,So quiet...,"This is a cd I enjoy playing but I am drawn to it less often than I would like to be. The performances are all good, if a little too clean and tidy, but my biggest gripe - and it isn't too big - is the VERY low volume of the recording. Whenever I play it I have to almost double the volume from any other cd to hear it. Other than that a good listen for those times when you want your orchestra to be a little bluer in sound and to swing a bit...and they do swing...a bit."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I've had better. I bought this CD for the Adams number, Lollapalooza, and was pleased. To my knowledge, there are very few recordings of this piece floating around out there, and I feel this one is the best - at the very least for the technical quality of the recording (eg all the instruments seem mic'd appropriately).Gershwin is by far the biggest disappointment of the lot. Coming across paradoxically as miserably fast and strangely unenergetic, it leaves the listener wishing they'd spent the last 17 minutes mowing the lawn instead of wallowing in front of the stereo.Not a bad album, but only for select pieces."
2,The Kids miss the mark,"I saw MTT conduct several of these pieces at the SFSymphony at the American Mavericks series in June 2000. The performances knocked my socks off and sent me out, breathless to find more. This CD is one of my biggest disappointments. The performances simply don't swing and come off kind of lacklustre-like muzak versions of Jazz classics from the fifties. For Antheil, try to find Ensemble Modern. Gershwin is ALWAYS more lively than this-try Paul Whiteman's recordings. Willem Breuker Kollektief from Holland does great modern sounds. This is strictly sleepy time stuff."
5,Undiscovered treasure,"I have been searching for this book for years! I read it one time when I was about 8 years old, and fell in love with the story. Many years later, after forgetting the title and author, I have finally found it! I have spent countless hours searching for this book on-line and in bookstores. Princess Furball is a wonderful, inspiring version of Cinderella. I love that she isn't a damsel in distress that lets everybody do stuff for her, because in my mind that's not a heroine! Princess Furball has spunk!"
4,Please read this book.,The book Princess Furball is a good book because it is full of surprises. Her father is going to make her marry an ogre! The book is full of surprising twists and turns. I think that you should read this book.
2,Not as good as I expected,"The picture quality is not that great (and yes the actual pictures are hi-res so they should look good.)The clock does not work with the included power adapter, you need a AA battery for the clock to work.The remote does not work. I am hoping, even though they had a protective strip to prevent the battery from wearing out, that it is just a dead battery and once I replace the CR2025 battery it will work.The contrast on the clock is not clear enough, so it makes it difficult to see at times, unless the clock is far away from you, which defeats the purpose of the frame. I have solved this problem by moving the frame so I look at it from an angle. I am glad I only spent $69 on it."
1,Poor quality,I have had this now since last Christmas and still don't like it. The quality of the photos is very poor compared to other digital photo frames and the usability is worse. I have yet to be able to get it to complete a slide show with all the photos on the card.
1,The Bible translated by Joseph Smith,"I just read through part of this book and found it no help at all. I have a problem with someone writing a book that is a correction of another book. As someone who reads the Holy Bible, I find this book offensive because it is supposedly ""corrected"" by Joseph Smith. It could have been titled, The Bible Translated by Joseph Smith."
4,The story of Captain R.Burton's visit to the American west,"A fun piece of period reading ... illuminating and a great way to get a feel for the kind of man Captain Richard Burton really was. His propensity to digress completely off topic is clearly seen here, as his penchant for providing the minutest detail about certain subjects he feels would be important to his government. The most intesting parts of the book have to do with his visit to Salt Lake City, early in 1860, when it was still being developed as a Mormon homeland, and his interaction with the various Indian and settler populations along the way during his long overland trip from Missouri to California."
4,"Nice, but small","Nice, but the molds are much smaller than I thought. Think the height of an individual mold is about 1 1/2inch tall. But still nice, next time I will purchase the larger mold."
1,too small,"Unfortunately, these cake pans are really just too small, the madelaines do not cook correcly in them, I have tried twice with two different recipes, I dont recommend buying such small trays unless you are a real expert baker perhaps."
3,Effective...but tiny!,"This cookie sheet does effectively make Madeline cookies...it just makes very tiny ones! In the small ""goodie bags"" handed out at the baby shower, we put six cookies per little bag and it still didn't really look like enough."
4,Nice filter system,Works great. I have it in a 40 gallon tank with about 20 gal of water. The turtles seem to enjoy climbing on the rocky exterior of the filter. I was able to use the regular Tetra Whisper filter cartridges which are cheaper than the reptofilters with this filter.
3,Tetra Decorative Reptile Filter,"I was using a Fluvial filter for my turtle tank. It worked great, but had to be taken apart to clean each week, and was kinda a pain in the butt. My turtle liked the water that squirted out.I needed something easier to clean while I recovered from surgery, so tried this. The reviews had been mixed, but I bought one anyway.Super easy to set up and looks really good. Its way easier to clean than my Fluvial. But....I can go longer between cleanings than I could with the Fluvial if I need to, but the water is never as crystal clear as the Fluvial it was the first few days after I cleaned it.It got me through recovery, but my turtle misses the jet of water squirting her. I do love the ease of changing the filters. So I am giving it an okey rating. Not great, not terrible. Maybe it would be better for a smaller turtle. My res is pretty big."
2,not for fish or anything that poops,"I was so stoked to get this filter for my future newt. Figured id test it on a few fish first. First few days were fantastic but now th3 water is xloudy and intake holes dont do anything. I watch food, plant matter and feces just float past. What a waste. I would have snt this back if i had the box. I'm highly disappointed. It probably has something to do with the fact that the pump is so small. I really don't understand why they would make such a small pump for such a large filter unit there's no way that this filter could possibly filter unit for 55 gallons of water when it can barely keep a 10 gallon tank clean which is only filled halfway so don't waste your money too little more research and buy a better filter this 1 is not worth your time or money."
2,"looks pretty, but does not filter well","I bought this filter about 3 mths ago. Wanted a more natural look for my turtle's tank. it's a beautiful design,looks great in tank. But it doesn't filter well. Works good for about 2-3 days, then cartridges get clogged and need to be replaced. And it doesn't use the whole cartridge, it only uses the bottom half. Just not worth the money."
2,"Attractive, nice waterfall, but pump quit after a month","I bought this as an additional filter/habitat enhancer for my Eastern Painted turtle. We were going on vacation, and I didn't want the person checking on Franklin to have to change out the water, and I thought that an additional filter would help with that. Unfortunately, the filter quit while we were on vacation. Fortunately turtles do okay in murky water (their natural habitat) and the four feeder fish don't seem the worse for it, either. Also, little pieces of plastic keep falling off of the inside when I rinse it out during the tank cleaning."
5,Highly Recommended,"In comparison to some other filters I've seen, this is very beautiful! I love the waterfall feature which keeps the tank crystal clear, and the inside pump is surprisingly quiet. Unfortunately, my Red Eared Slider cannot make the climb to the top. This is a very LARGE filter so you will need at least a 40 gallon tank. The pros outweigh the cons for me, so I just set up a separate basking area for my turtle.Update: after purchasing a completely separate basking dock, http://www.amazon.com/Reptology%C2%AE-Large-Turtle-Floating-Platform/dp/B003U83ERU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1296973511&sr;=8-2 ..I found my RES basking on top of this filter! oh well...I guess he'll just have a choice of platforms, the little brat!"
4,Great product,I bought this for my husband's 55g tank that he has a Chinese Water Dragon in. He wanted a waterfall and while looking I found this. We have a tub of water placed in the tank and it works great except the filters will get clogged with the substract that Spike throws in the tub and the water will stop flowing into the hole were the pump is. Cleaning the filters worked. It looks nice and is perfect for what we wanted. It has a nice spot on top he can lounge if he wants to. It works with just a few inches of water. I would recommend it to anyone. It was also a good price and bigger than we thought but works perfect in the corner of the tub. I have Hermit Crabs in a 29g but if I had a bigger tank I would buy another for a big pond for them to help with humidity.
3,Works great for single-turtle,"The filter works great for single-turtle tanks, but if you have a turtle you know they are messy creatures. It is more challenging to use with two turtles in the tank. Definitely keep the water level higher--more toward the max level rather than ""minimum"" level listed on the side of the filter, or it'll run the pump dry when the filters clog from gunk it's pulling from the turtle water. I've even had to pull up the filters, letting some water go by unfiltered, to get it to work sometimes. You must take the filters out and rinse WELL, FREQUENTLY (at LEAST every 2 or 3 days, with something like a pulsating shower head or sprayer of some sort that has some good pressure) or it will clog. Other than that and being a it nubbly and therefore challenging to clean, I really like this filter and have had two. They sound pretty and look great. The turtles love to try to climb them (as turtles do!) but it's just steep enough to prevent that at my turtles' current size (7"" and 6"")."
5,Tetra filter,"Good filter. Water stays cleaner, longer. Turtle loves to climb it. Would highly recommend it! Had other filters and this is the best by far."
3,Good filter BUT...,"I love the look of this filter and it is a hard working filter but it doesn't stand up to our one dirty turtle on it's own. I wouldn't recommend using it on it's own but if you have powerheads or another small filter it's great. However it looks great and that was a plus for me. You definately will have to change filters at least once a month and rinse them every week between changing. Also if you're putting it in a larger tank (mine is in a 40 gal) and you want your turtle to have some depth to swim in you may need to prop it up on something, we simply used a couple of large bricks for this. We have about 15-20 gal of water in the tank as well as the filter and an undergravel filter with a powerhead and can keep water pretty clear for about a month or so. Bottom line don't use it in a large tank as your only filter and you'll love it."
4,nice,"Adds a nice decorative touch and can be used with or without the filter itself. The filter does a nice job to keep my tank of five baby turtles clean for a good few weeks.The only downside I would say is the limited amount of space this product allows. The water line limit is pretty low. I'd like to fill it up higher, but if i did, you wouldn't be able to see the nice water fall. Wish the product was higher"
2,improper design for a 6in turtle,"I have a 6in turtle and 40 gallon tank. I fill the tank just below the filter outlet where the water comes out. The problem is that from there to top the filter is not well designed for turtle to climb up. it is too steep for the turtle to climb. I have to shop for another filter. Water cleaning is just ok. If the water is too low, the filter stops working so make sure the tank is filled way up close to the outlet."
2,Only for looks,"Upon seeing this I thought that it would be perfect for my RES, but I'm greatly disappointed. At first I thought it was working fine, but after about a week or so I noticed that the water(about 30gal)in my tank was stagnant. So I unplugged the filter and cleaned it out thoroughly. A couple of days later it wasn't running smooth again and the water was murky. I also noticed that my turtle could not get onto the basking platform because it was too steep and narrow and she fell backwards into the water trying to climb up. In the end, the filter is good only for looks and I would not recommend it."
2,Did not work very well,"First of all mine arrived broken on the inside layer of the 'ceramic/plaster crap"" it is made out of. It was still usable however, it says for up to 55 gallons, turtle owners should know that they need a filter rated for 2-3 times as many gallons as they actually have. I had about 20 gallons of my tank full with using this, with no gravel, feeding in a different tank and it would still stop working at least once a week. I finally gave up on this filter and built my ATBA and upgraded my filter."
3,Red-ear Sliders,"This product is ok, when cleaning a turtle tank you have to pay special attention to all of the nook and cranies that the lower half of the intact holes are. Otherwise the turtles waste builds up and creates a place for horrible smells. The filters are in an easy location to pull out quickly. The pump is easy to clean and take apart.There are clearly marked water level lines on the back side of the filter which is a big help, this product is not ideal if you are looking into that a lot of water depth in your tank. I would recommend for other reptiles other than aquatic turtles like red-ear sliders."
5,rock filter,"I got one of these quite a while ago for my dart frogs tank, I even put a little shelter on the top for them to hang out in.I think it works fine but I also use a external canister filter as a tannin filter system to get that yellow color out of the water that you can get when you have a land - water terrarium."
4,Genealogy,"This is a good resource to check if you have relatives who lived in or came through early Virginia. While the optical reader has not ""translated"" the book perfectly to an electronic format, the errors are generally in upper- or lower-case lettering and do not interfere with the readability."
4,"Not quite what I wanted, but I think it will be useful...","Well, I was hoping that this book would help me with my ancestry research for the Powell and Parrott families. It isn't quite what I wanted. Parrott or even the mispelling version of the name shown in the preface don't appear and the Powells listed don't quite llink to my tree. For the Kindle version price though I think it will be useful for background on the surrounding Virginia families. At the $.99 price point, I am happy to add this to my background source materials. Other VA families may find a direct hit. Well worth the Kindle version price point."
2,Unreliable,"Good: looks amazing and is really slim on the wrist. Photo does not quite convey the feeling of the ""blackness"".The black part of bracelet seems to be silicon resin, not some cheap plastic. Clasp seems reliable.Bad: mine was prone to stopping in colder temperatures, like 10 degrees C. Died after about two years and not because of battery, can't possibly be repaired. My SFK103B which also belongs to Skin series stopped at least once as well with a fresh battery and in a normal temperature."
3,muy buenos,"compramos estos cables para mi iglesia y el resultado a sido muy bueno, no hemos tenido ningun problema funcionan bien, ya han pasado un par de meses y hasta la fecha no hemos tenido problemas, si tu estas pensando en cables para la el guitarra o el teclado creo que estos serian los ideales para tus instrumento. lo unico que puedo decir es que no te dejes llevar por la imagen o como los presentan, ya que en la foto que aparecen parace que son seis cables, y no es asi solo es uno asi que no me puedo quejar por calidad, pero si por la forma de como los anuncian ya que parace que vinieran seis cables por el precio que anuncian y no es asi solo viene uno, asi que ten mucho ojo cuando te decidas por elejir tu producto"
4,A Collection of Some Amazing Stories,"I don't know if i've ever read a book that was just so jam packed with so many amazing stories about how dedicated the Jewish people were to obtaining a hold on part of the land of Israel. This book is a refreshing read of commitment to a cause, putting oneself aside to serve the greater cause. This book is so well written, it is incredibly difficult to put down and you'll be telling everyone the amazing stories found within. The authors do a great job of weaving the interviews together, taking the reader all the way through the battle for the Land of Israel. This is a compilation of the stories of so many people who were fighting for a people that were not their own, too. From a Native American to normal Americans struck with the plight of the displaced Jews throughout Europe.A must read for anyone with an interest in the subject or just someone who likes some amazing stories."
4,Erik Satie... on accordion...,"This CD is a collection of Erik Satie solo piano pieces performed on solo accordion... it sounds like... Erik Satie... on accordion. Which is a good thing! Very tastefully done, Mr. Anzellotti sticks to the written notes without over-interpretation or campiness. Heard on accordion, the pieces take on a uniquely dreamy, nostalgic, and slightly surreal quality, especially the exotic ""Gnossiennes."" The familiar ""Gymnopedie #1"" sounds especially lovely in this setting, and the jauntier sections of ""Sports and Divertissments"" benefit from the playful quality of the accordion. While an hour of solo accordion is a bit much in one sitting, this is a wonderful release for those wanting to hear Satie's music in a refreshing new light. Mr. Satie himself would be pleased, no doubt! (And as usual, the Winter & Winter label outdoes itself with beautiful packaging and design!)"
5,Exposes cultural imperative disguised as medical necessity,"The history of the clinical management of intersex has previously been relegated to medical texts- texts which illuminate technologies to ""treat"" intersex while ignoring the experience of the recipients of such protocols. Alice Dreger's book unveils the identities of those who heretofore have appeared in textbook photographs and illustrations with their genitals in sharp focus but with their faces obscured. In the process, Dreger reveals how medicine has often tragically subordinated what is between the patient's ears and in the patient's heart to what is between the patient's legs. While physicians would be well-served to incorporate the information and perspectives Dreger offers, the book should appeal to a far larger audience because it challenges the reader's assumption that sex is like Carvel (two flavors only) when in reality it is Baskins & Robbins."
3,useful.,"This one's easy: 1) It's a great introduction to Intersex issues; 2) in the trans community we talk a lot about the distinction between sex and gender, and often like to mention how gender is constructed but sex isn't. This book, however, points out that sex, too, is constructed: in this case, by modern medicine; 3) it's a little more academic, sometimes is repetitive, but it's got a wealth of information."
5,Amazing!,This book is wonderful! It gives a tremendous amount of insight to the intersexed. A must for anyone interested in the history of sexuality.
5,Three Big Hogs,I love this book! It has been among my favorites for years. The text and illustrations are witty and it makes me laugh everytime I read it. It was shipped promptly and came in condition as stated. Thank you
4,Pretty Nice,"Good product, does what it says and fairly priced. It does get a lot of dust sticking to it as other have complained, but that's sort of the point, to keep the debris on the cover, not the player itself. As far as the complaints about the dust getting under the cover, I haven't seen to much of that myself, but it's not that much of a hassle to take the cover off and clean everything once in awhile."
2,"Protects from small falls, but ends up doing more damage","The Kroo case will keep your Vision:M playing if it happens to fall off your desk, but once you put this case on never expect the player to look the same again. Dust will get under the skin and rub against the player, creating scratches and dull spots all over the outside of your Zen."
4,"Great for the 30GB, not for the 60GB","Great for the 30GB version, but WARNING: This does not fit the NEW Zen Vision M 60GB Model. The new model is thicker!"
3,I don't like it...,"I thought it'd be a lot nicer, and i don't see how something like this could protect my creative. I guess i should have went with the leather. And i have no idea how to get the belt clip on it, but that doesn't matter since it looks like it could break easily with it on anyways."
2,Just wasn't for me,It is a great case to use for protecting your Zen but i must admit that the screen cover comes off too easily and the wrong bump from someone else will give you no screen cover.But it does provide good shock protection.I would know because I'm rather clumsy.
2,ugly,"The player itself was on the thicker side, but with this case on, it made it just rediculous. on top of that, the case was loose and din't fit right, and it made things look kind of ugly, and i couldn't take it. i took it off five minutes after i put it on. I hated it. I couldn't figure out how to put the belt clip on, and there were no instructions to tell me how."
5,Fundamental for Understanding the __Pro Caelio__,"This is a long-needed reprint of a work which is fundamental for understanding Cicero's __Pro Caelio__. That speech relies heavily on humor and comedy throughout, and Geffcken explains her subject clearly and concisely. This book is a cholarly work, but it opens the speech up marvelously: after reading Geffckken you are much more likely to realize just how delicious some of Cicero's comedic attacks are. I recommend it to absolutely anyone who might read Cicero's __Pro Caelio__, including high school students preparing for the AP examination."
1,Get the newer release version,"Whatever you do, don't buy this copy of the YUA movie. ADV acquired the masters to this and then sat on it for so long that they released a VHS-quality version on DVD: non-anamorphic; missing the 5.1 audio; and from the look of it made from a composite (TV) master.Fortunately ADV are re-releasing it in February 2005 as it should have been the first time around. Get that version instead. Do not support this crappy release by buying it."
2,Wait for the Special Edition instead...,"Do not buy this letterboxed crap that looks absolutely horrendous. It sets an example of what not to put on a DVD. ADV will be releasing a special edition on 9/27/2005 that features a brand new, anamorphic transfer and 5.1 audio."
3,"Sorry, wrong book!","I'm sorry, the review I wrote above is wrong! I'm still finding that book, so....This book does have some of the quality though. It's a old book with some pictures of ballets. It's crammed with text about ballet dancers of the company, ballets, stuff like that. It's kind of messy, too, so you'll have to look to find things. It's an inch or so thick."
2,Starts Well; Goes Nowhere,"The Wells time machine premise is great. The archaeological theme is handled well. The first 125 pages or so are pretty absorbing. Then it takes a dive. More and more of the same maddeningly slow-moving journal entries, mostly describing the greenery (though I did like Graham). You think it's going to get back up to speed or at least offer more than the narrator continuing to mourn lost love, lost friendship, lost parents -- but even when things actually begin to happen around page 221, it's not nearly as interesting as the first part of the book. A wasted opportunity."
2,"Gripping beginning, but...","Starts out well, with some really beautiful writing and great ideas. But it went soft in middle, which became caught up in description and as a result the tension disappears. Too bad. I enjoyed the first third."
3,Great premise but falls down on the follow-through.,"Since a synopsis of the plot is already printed, I won't bore you running through it here. Unfortunately, I was bored running through the book. What a great premise -- H.G Wells' Time Machine exists and an archeologist is going to take a ride into the future! What a let-down. There's no denying that this is a well-written book, but I like books that are plot and character driven. This book is a great idea. There is little ""story"" and the characters are poorly developed. Such interesting people and I never got to find out more about them! It's a great hook, but when I expected the book to really take off, it just ran out of gas."
2,"Good Concept, Boring Writing","First the concept - A man with an uncurable disease, discovers a time machine created by an associate of H.G. Wells. He decides to go to the future to seek a cure.Unfortunately the writing style to this book was excrutiatingly boring, written in the first person. The narrator (the man with the incurable disease) jumps from concept to concept, without anything interesting to say. There is virtually no action. When he gets to the future, everything is destroyed and you keep waiting for him to encounter people, which never seems to happen. I found H.G. Wells Time Machine to be vastly more interesting and that was written over 100 years ago.Many other readers have given this book very high marks for writing and I wonder how they can? I know I kept finding myself skipping over a lot of paragraphs throughout the book and had to fight with myself to keep from just jumping to the back of the book and reading the end so I could get on with it."
2,Interesting but slow and over-romantic,"I liked the idea, the main character and it's adventures. Broken down into two sets, the past love affair, and the present adventures (in the future), it is too divided to appeal as either a romantic or scientific high-flyer. Instead it crawls in boredom and I cought myself skipping paragraph after paragraph."
3,Great idea with a weak follow-through,"Yes, this book is definitely written by someone who knows how to write and write well. BUT, it starts off with an amazing idea (which, I hope, you've already read about). I, however, disagree with my fellow reviewers. The rest of this book comes nowhere near the promise of its premise. Once our hero arrives in future England and the general ""look what we did to ourselves"" realization is made clear, the rest of the book falls flat. He has a couple of very interesting charcters (particularly Lady Macbeath) but he gives then no real life. The whole thing reads like a literary experiment. I'd like someone to come along and give this great idea the treatment it deserves."
3,An imitation of H.G.Wells,"Although I describe this book as an imitation of Wells, I liked the story. The visual image of a London turned into a jungle alone made the book worth reading. The visualization and the desire to know more kept me turning the pages. At times the author gets too metaphoric, but never too cliche. In order to connect to this book I believe you must like futuristic/apocalyptic stories. The author does not get too overwhelmingly ""scientific"" and I find that a strength. The humans of the 26th century are not very interesting, but the journey was worth it."
2,Well written but poorly thought out,"Though I was impressed by Wright's prose, I thought the plot he devised from the premise was both disappointing and weak. He writes from the environmentalist- pessimist's point-of-view about the future; humanity has fallen victim to itself in what is a thinly-veiled analysis of the failings of Britain in the 1990s, yet the assumptions that he bases his future on contradict themselves. Moreover, the outcome is a predictable one. He paints himself into a corner that is fairly evident by the middle of the novel, which was sad to see given the inspiring potential of his premise."
2,"Great idea, but too much time spent on the romance of it all","The space wasted with the romance angle would have been better used as room for more imaginative writing. I enjoyed the creative effort towards the outlook of the future, but found myself dreading the romance. It seemed to go on and on and on. I know the title should have warned me; I was expecting a smaller portion than I received and was full before I finished."
3,Live and Loud,"I recently purchaed this on CD and it's just as good as the vinyl copy I had as a kid w/o the pops and hisses. I was able to find an import copy that also included ""Gypsy"", ""Lady Double Dealer"", ""Smoke On The Water/With A Little Help From My Friends"", and ""Going Down/Highway Star"". I could have done without the covers of ""With A Little Help With My Friends"" and ""Going Down""; there's enough Deep Purple material to have played something else. For this reason I give this set a 3 out of 5.I did notice that on ""Mistreated"" that near the end the howling screams of Glenn Hughes were edited to a more palatable volume. The interpolation of ""Rock Me Baby"" also works well with ""Mistreaded"""
3,Good,"THis CD is very good, although Purple mania of always extending the songs to various minutes is sometimes very boring!"
5,EXPLOSIVE MARK III LIVE CONCERT 1975,I bought this album when it first came out in the mid 70s and have always liked it. It is as good as Made in Japan. Blackmore is smoking. Coverdale is so soulful and powerful. Everyone else just lays it on the line. Buy this instead of Burn and Stormbringer. You will not be dissappointed.
5,Regardless of the editing associated with this disc...,"it is by far the best example of the Mark III live shows. This cd was compiled from several gigs during the final shows with Ritchie Blackmore in 1975. People complain about the editing...but they should not, it improves the overall experience. What was edited? Mistreated is from two different shows and spliced together to make the best version of the song in existence. The outro is edited and looped. Glenn's vocals on Mistreated are mixed very low to non-existent. Lady Double Dealer is great as well. You Fool No One is also perfect on this with a very cool mid-section which is also featured on Rainbows On Stage CD a year or so later. You could go ahead and buy MarkIII:The Final Concerts (and Burn and Stormbringer is better on it...) but you would not get the performances you hear here, edited or not. Enjoy this CD for what it is."
2,Quotes,"Not really what I expected. There are too much other stuff associated with the quotes. I would have liked it better if it had more quotes and less explanation. It does have good quotes, but i would not buy it again, or for someone else."
4,I'm Leaving You - For Me,"""Best of Con Funk Shun"" has all my favorite songs by this Vallejo California group. I listen to this cd when I'm exercising and/or cooking. I play it all the time! One of my favorite songs on this cd is ""I'm leaving you for me""! (not sure if that's the title) Me and my family and friends always end up partying to this cd. FUN! FUN! FUN!"
5,This Music Rocks!,This is music is so slamming it put me in a half Nelson. Tis is definitely a must buy!
2,Not so good...,"This is the second book I read by Fleming (the first being ""GOLDFINGER"").And, for the second time, I fought to reach the end of the book, because I tought it to be boring. I prefer Clive Cussler and his Dirk Pitt adventures. (although Fleming has much more class)"
4,Oh how times have changed,"I got this book as a 99cent special from Amazon. I had read all of these books before, all the Ian Fleming James Bond books, but decided it would be fun to go back and revisit them.It was fun and I did really enjoy the book, but times have changed so much; there are so many sterotypical scenes in this book regarding blacks, though Quarles was a very brave and heroic figure. It was very interesting to go back and revisit something I originally read in the 60's and see how far we have come, and how glad I am that we have come that far.A fast easy and fun read, as are all the James Bond books, but it was a trip to read it with 2012 sensibilities,"
3,"Good, but not great","This book was a good book to the James BOnd series, but it was not the best. Although a movie was made about it, they are almost completly different. It seems that the movie, 'License to Kill' was closer to the book 'Live and Let Die' than the movie, 'Live and Let Die.' This book features the part where Felix is fed to the sharks (but he lives), just the same as the movie 'License to Kill.' The plot in the book is almost completely different than the movie 'Live and Let Die.'But don't get me wrong, this book is definitly worth reading. In fact, you should read it if you plan on reading James Bond books that occur after this book. It contains some helpful information. Over all, this book was not bad, it just wasn't the best."
4,Bond Returns,"The second book in the James Bond series is definitely better than the first, ""Casino Royale"". The pace is quicker and the characters are much more intriguing, particularly Bond's nemesis, Mr. Big. In addition, Bond does some globe-trotting, whereas in ""Casino Royale"" the action takes place in basically one locale. While ""Live and Let Die"" has it's dark moments, it is a bit more light-hearted than its predecessor. The best part of this book has to be the ending, in which Mr. Big meets his fate. Truly spine-tingling! A must read for James Bond fans."
4,Dated and stereotypical but still packs a punch and is a good read,"This James Bond novel was written in 1954. It's full of tension, excitement and outrageous adventures and the narrative moved fast and kept my eyes glued to the page. The fact that it is dated made it all the more interesting. It describes a world where the hero smokes two packs of cigarettes a day, women are mostly decorative and racism is blatant and non-apologetic. It also made me wince because all the bad guys were black and all the good guys were white and they were portrayed in the most stereotypical way possible.That said, I did enjoy the book and can see why Ian Fleming has done so well through the years. The book is a pure fantasy and great escape literature. I found it a good read but I did get a little impatient with it because there was no doubt that the good guys were going to win. I'm glad I read it but I have no intention of reading any more of Ian Fleming. This taste of his work is about all I could stand."
5,First-rate James Bond thriller,"This action-packed tale may be the best of Ian Fleming's 007 spy thrillers. The adventure has it all: a dashing hero, tense situations and close shaves, voodooism, exotic locales, racially-drawn battle lines, a pretty damsel in distress and cold-blooded killers under the tight control of a brilliant but malevolent agent of the Russian spy network SMERSH. The discovery of gold coins in Harlem has aroused the interest of the British and American intelligence services and Mr. Bond is dispatched to solve the mystery of where they came from and who is smuggling them from Jamaica to the Florida gulf coast. Simon Vance narrates the book expertly, taking the listener on a journey into a dark world of spy intrigue through Harlem, St. Petersburg, and finally, the northern coast of Jamaica. Vance gives each character his or her own personality and blends them all together into a wonderful tapestry of thrilling suspense."
4,Another Great Book in the Series,"If you enjoyed Casino Royale, then you will also like the next book in the series, Live and Let Die. I don't know what it was, but I think it is just a little less enjoyable than the first book. The reason being the way that Ian writes for the black characters, it is some times hard to read and understand what they are saying. Trying to get the accent of what all black people talk like, according to him, makes some of the lines unreadable. Such as, it will say something like 'I dun no bot dis bose' but worse.Anyway, still a good story overall, but almost completely different from the movie."
4,More Like 3-and-a-half stars,"I enjoyed this book, I did, it wasn't bad...It just wasn't great either. This is Fleming's second ""Bond"" book, and compared to his first one,""Casino Royale,"" it's not that great. Don't get me wrong, bond fan's will love it, it has great action sequences, but it just lacks something that Casino Royale had...I don't know, just forget everything I've just said and read the book, you'll like it. Really, you will."
5,Great book!,This book was given as a gift to a Bond fan! It was a hit. Excellent condition and will be purchasing the next!
4,A Real Bond Story,"I just started reading the James Bond books and started with Casino Royale, which wasn't a really great book. I described it as an apprentice effort in my review. That brings me to 'Live and Let Die' which felt like Ian Fleming really getting his legs under him.In this book, Bond finds himself trying to stop money laundering from an ancient shipwreck. The story takes him from New York to Florida to Jamaica. This time Fleming is able to control the tempo of the novel with his use of tempo, description, and characterization.Fleming built a more credible universe, one populated by a real villain that was much more sinister and had a motive for trying to destroy James Bond.A highlight for me was the building of the tension that led up to the first meeting between Bond and Mr. Big. While there were still some points where the writing could have been more complete, this was a much more solid effort by Fleming."
3,Not as Good as Casino Royale,"Seems dated and far-fetched. Portrayal of blacks will offend some, but was probably an accurate picture of the times (mid 1950's). Not at all like what the Sean Connery movies portrayed (although this title wasn't made into a movie until Roger Moore came on the scene)."
4,Fast Paced and Enjoyable,"The second Bond novel has a fairly simple plot yet some of the most memorable moments in the Bond series. Bond is sent to New York because some underworld thug is smuggling god coins to the Russians. The thug, named Mr. Big, is a SMERSH agent and Bond, along with CIA contact Felix Leiter, are up to spoiling his plans.This book, published around 1954, could be deemed racy in today's world (in the context that it was written by an aging white European many years ago) and the love scenes with Solitaire (Mr. Big's card reader) seem forced - as if Fleming was too uptight describing passion.However, overall this is an enjoyable book, fast paced, lots of action and great characters."
2,"Bond seems, well, a little dim","I was never much of a Bond fan until the latest Daniel Craig films. I read all the books as a teenager in the late 1960s, and my memory tells me that they were OK. I decided to give them another try and I am finding them tough going.Casino Royale was interesting because of the casino - I am not a gambler but the details lent real depth to the story.Live and Let Die just seems moronic, in both characterization and plot. The racial overtones are constantly jarring, and Bond seems to always be behind the curve, reacting instead of attacking. He isn't portrayed as shrewd, savvy and alert, but more like a dim thug who shrugs off the warning signs of impending harm and then has to suffer because of it.I will try a few more, and if Bond remains a dim thug, I will abandon the effort and re-read Robert A Parker's most excellent Spenser books for a third time ... at least Spenser is a literate thug.John DaviesSpokane WA"
5,The Big Man,"I definitely recommend this book. So much better than Royale; Fleming seemed to catch on how to wrote a novel after his freshmen attempt. But what makes a good story or movie is a great villain. Like Th Dark Knight`s Joker, the Big Man is in James bond."
3,Great looking reprint,"I've purchsed several of the repackaged James Bond novels, intending to read them in (or close to) the 50-year anniversary of the first film's release. The jacket designs are very attractive. I found the stories dated (no surprise), and Bond a surprisingly unappealing hero. Reading these novels gave me new appreciation for Sean Connery's performance which added a degree of warmth and humor not found in the novel's Bond. Live and Let Die had a slow and painful start, but at the 2/3 mark, when the story moves to Jamaica it livens up. The detailed descriptions of Jamaica in the 1950s or 1960s as well as the underwater scenes are evocative; you get a sense that Fleming really loved Jamaica. This isn't for everybody, but I'm glad I read it."
5,Love the mullet cut,"Not only is this a classic album it represents a classic haircut.Ever since he came out I have rocked the mullet cut.This cd is simply amazing, nothing else compares.I would like to see him colaberate with Limp Bizkit, that would rock.He would make a great rock rap artist."
5,fresh new artist from the Bluegrass State with his own sound,"I have been a Billy Ray fan since his hungry days in the bars in Ohio and West Virginia. His sound is uniquely his own and that is definitely a breath of fresh air for country music. I have enjoyed all his cd's but my favorite one is still Some Gave All. His approach to music is a combination of rock, country and bluegrass. This CD has great songs but my favorite songs are Could Have Been Me and Where'm Gonna Live these songs show the vocal ability that he has and the emotional range he is capable of. I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in the other side of country music and especially to rock-a-billy fans."
4,"Review the musical content, not the hair......","I've been guilty of it myself, commenting on the foibles of the artist rather than the content of the disc. I'll try to correct that. Right off the bat, eliminate AchyBreaky. Ok, get over it. It was 10years ago-it's done, he's on Pax Tv, he's suffered enough. This is good basic 90's country that really is quite the norm now days. To call it groundbreaking is obviously wrong, but a lot of country acts ""choose"" their songs from huge books of writers material. The selections here are great. Its very listenable and again, discount the A-Breaky and the mullet, it's not that bad. Worth 9.00 bucks? You bet!"
3,Interesting enough for an hour or so.,This review is for the ABRIDGED recording.The story moved along at a nice clip and the imagery was vivid enough but it was pretty much all action and not enough character interaction for me (maybe it was edited out). Mimi Rogers did a decent enough job of reading but at times it was difficult to tell who was who.
4,for my weather station,its lovely its does not need batters a plus for me. it was well packaged i dont think a tank could have hute it.its not digital also a plus.
2,A blast from the past!,"This book is a 45 year old paperback, and so it is not in very good shape. It is howerver complete. I loved the Addams Family TV show (re-runs) as a kid, and so I had to get this book. It's fairly silly, and cerainly doesn't hold up very well when compared to the novels of today, but, it is still fun. It's always nice to find something that brings back a little bit of yesterday."
2,Rent before you buy,"People I got sucked into buying this collection last year because everyone said Neon Genesis Eva was the best anime period...so I bought it cold...with out even seeing it first.To put it simply, the animation, initial character development, and general overal concept are great. But the characters and story really never go anywhere. The first half of the collection is solid but you get bored with them trying to overcomplicate the plot. I love a complex story but by the end of the series you really could care less what happens to any of them!"
3,Good if you want the episodes but...,"This is not the Platinum edition that you think it is. While it does contain the redone episodes and 4 director's cut episodes, it is very dissapointing otherwise. The real Platinum edition comes with a booklet for each dvd that explain things in the episodes (which is really cool if you want to know what its all about). In adition, as far as I can tell, all the extra's on the real DVDs are missing here. No commentary, no interviews, no nothing. Just the redone episodes plus the 4 directors cut episodes. Its great if you just wanted better looking and sounding episodes. Its a terrible let down if you thought you were getting all the cool extras for a great price."
3,Not for everyone.,"I won't lie, the last two episodes of this show gave me a feeling comparable to the moment you realize the guy at dominoes ejaculated onto your pizza. The plot was interesting, and i respect the whole ""interpret the story for yourself"" sentiment that they were going for, i really do. This series however, leaves too much to interpretation and just leaves you with a confusing plot. The movie ""the End of Evangelion"" ties some things together nicely kind of and has some beautiful imagery but is still a little confusing, but at least its not a full hour of ""I am myself"" ""I am the me that exists in YOUR mind."" Some of the characters are annoying at first but grow on me, like rei. Other characters i hate from beginning to end, like Shinji, don't even get me started about how much i hated shinji's character. Overall im glad i watched and would watch it again."
1,"In Response to ""Close, but no Cigar but which Cigar do you want to Light?""","In light of new evidence, I take back everything I ever said about this Series.Apparently, the end result is just because the Producers, Writers, and Director had no actual communication with each other, leading to a disjointed mess.I am no longer able to accept the flaws in the Plot Narrative as ""artistic"" license, instead of just being shodding craftsmanship and disfocused writing."
3,entertaining but at times slow,"The series is packed with interesting characters of all types from the mysteriously quiet Rei, to the self-deprecating Shinji, to the boisterous braggart Asuka. The dialogue is entertaining and amusing but the story line drags tremendously in parts leaving you wanting. The combat sequences are tech-talk laden and also tend to drag more than they should. The concepts are interesting enough but for all the technical language they are not explored to any real depth. I would suggest this series is for ages 15 and up due to some brief nudity and mature topics. I would recommend it to sci-fi anime fans as one of the better series available."
3,good but *incomplete*,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is a mixed bag... it's almost like they got the concept by reaching into a grab bag of descriptions and made a story based on what random words they pulled out.christianity, angels, robots, children, pilots, fighting, survival, attack, govt project.It's beautifully animated, voice acting is pretty good in my opinion... but the story just never seems to go anywhere. It's fight angel, fight angel, fight angel, little bit of awkward teen social issues, hope we survive all 13 angels and then we're safe. Honestly while I enjoy it, I really don't get it... as a matter of fact no one I know or talked to about it gets anything about the show except the basic plot of children piloting ""robots"" (I know they are not robots but I don't know what else to call them) fighting angels.anyways I've never had an issue with my DVD set and I've had it since it was released in the U.S."
2,Neon Genesis Evangelion: A potentially great giant fighting robot movie ruined by a whining brat.,"The whole movie is about how the child ""hero"" of the movie can't connect with his maniacal father, and he whines about it incessantly. He moves in with an older woman who is used as the foil to bring out double innuendos and panty-shots.There is some occasional fan service.The artwork is great, the GFR's are well thought out, and the bad guys are cool.It's all ruined by a whining 14 year old boy.--James Rosse"
1,messed up disk,The actual seris is nice. But the fifth and sixth episodes would not play. The DVD was somehow damaged?! The packaging was new though; so I don't know what went wrong.
2,The shipping service sucks,"All I want to say to the people that actually are thinking of buying it is that the service of amazon and ups sucks. Maybe amazon is not responsable and ups is but all I know is that I didn't get my movies that I paid for. I haven't seen NGE but nothing bad I can say about it I still want to see it but with this shipping service I don't know if I will.Other than the shipping service well is preatty good I guess, do keep this in mind try to think about the shipping. SO WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T GET ONE-DAY SHIPPING!!!"
5,recipient is very happy with this DVD..,"This DVD was purchased for a third party, & that individual is very pleased with it (though hasn't watched all of it yet)."
4,"Brilliant series, but quite disturbing...","This series is very good, but it isnt something i would like to watch on a regular basis, like friends or family guy. The primary reason being it's so darn depressing, i would even go as far to say that watching this series too much could damage you mentaly, especially if your recovering from depresion. It makes the veiwer feel pointless, like theres no meaning to anything we do, it also projects the notion that life is just a lonley, hostile trudge to the grave...then again, some of you might like that kind of thing. I swear some people are only happy when thier miserable, if youre one then this is the show for you. On a more postive note, the show has several hilarious moments which will have you rolling around in stitches, plus it has some amazing fight sequences. I give it 4 stars for the artwork and originality of the story, plus the surreal effect it has on the veiwer, though it lacks the final star because its quite depresing."
3,"Sorry about that,","Hi, this is the reviewer from ""Help for Datko"" and as it turns out I made a mistake. The four director's cut episodes are on this box set.Sorry for the mistake."
5,ADV has done an unbelievable job,"I've already reviewed this show, but I am reviewing the way that ADV has put this package together. Put simply, it is amazing. Rather than putting the whole show on 8 discs, the regular run of the show is on 5 discs, plus a 6th disc with the 4 director's cut episodes. The picture and sound quality on these discs blows the old set's quality out of the water, and the convenient packaging saves a ton of space on my shelf (nothing really to do with the DVDs I know, but just a personal note there). Above all, the 4 director's cut episodes are actually quite well worth it with some very interesting footage (some flat-out creepy i might add!). Out of the 5 characters that were re-dubbed for this occasion, only 1 really needed it, but whatever. If you haven't watched Evangelion before, or if you want better sound and picture than the set you may currently own, then by all means you must pick this up! It only cost me 58 bucks brand new!"
4,Very good,"All in all a very good product. The discs are excellent quality, and the remastering of the old animation looks great. The story itself is very good until the last few episodes, that's why this collection gets only 4 stars. I'm sorry to all the die hard fans, but that last episode just plain sucks. Luckily, there is a movie called ""End of Evangelion"" that actually provides a decent ending to the series. Pick this up if you like mecha, phsycho-thrillers, or wimpy main characters."
4,The ride was good...,"There are a number of die-hard giant robo fans out there who refuse to admit any fault of this series. I can see why on some levels, but the ending was very slapped on. I won't give anything away, but the whole series is stunning and captivating..... and then I woke up drooling on my living room floor only to realize the last two episodes had come and gone. Really, some of these directors need to stop trying to be so philosophical and just shoot a good ending that ties up all the loose ends. Lots of funny fan service in this though, that's a chuckle!"
1,where are my dvds?!,"so i payed for this box set and i never got it...so sometimes i pretend how good the dvds could be, but the truth of the matter is i have no clue because what happen is i payed but then never recieved anything. I do find it odd that amazon would send me an email to write a review for an item that they never sent me but i did pay for it. I suppose that's half the fun though, paying...i guess if i never payed for the item i wouldn't be feeling this swarm of exciting emotions such as anger, regret, and rage. It's sort of like approaching someone of the oppisite gender for me...if i wouldn't have in the first place i would always wonder would could have been but in this case with the dvds i did ""go for it"" only to be shot down and left with a little less than i had before...if someone that did pay for the boxset of evangellion and actually did get the dvds in-tact via postage, i would appreciate any secrets you could share about your success!"
2,"Bravo to ""Close, But no Cigar'","I know many people are going to completely disagree with me on this but I belive ""Close, but no Cigar"" is absolutely right. They make an excellent point, a point that so many people fail to see. Evangelion is a very flawed series in the sence that the philosiphy is very loose. I totally 100% agree."
3,Spend the money for a newer translation,"Cary's translation was fine in its day, however to the modern ear it's tough slogging. There are so many wonderful, readable translations available today (Musa, Hollander). Yes, this is cheap, but you get what you pay for. The three stars are for Cary, not Dante!Afterlife - An Introduction to Dante's Inferno"
2,Lost in translation,"I remember loving this book & theory when i was in school, however this version did nothing for me; as a matter of fact i didn't even finish reading it all the way through - very disappointing."
1,a disappointing waste of money and time,"I purchased this book to help teach the Inferno, with the expectations that the Harold Bloom name would be indicative of insight, erudition, and critical commentary. What I received was a ""Cliff's Note's"" wanna-be, without any depth, analysis of characters or themes. It was simpy a collection of extraordinarily brief essays from critics of the past few centuries."
1,Horrible Tights!!!,"While the shipping was speedy, the tights on the other hand were horrible. The fit was not true to size, the top band rests in an awkward and uncomfortable place and according to their return policy on the receipt they do not accept returns or exchanges on tights. Meaning I am stuck with a horrible pair of tights and out nearly $15. If you do order these I would highly recommend getting at least one size bigger and ordering them through a different vendor that accepts exchanges in case you are unhappy with the product like I was."
2,This is actually indian/american cookbook,"I've owned this cookbook for around 10 years. I cooked out of it and it never inspired me. (it actually called for ricotta cheese!) Then I got the Indian Curry cookbook by Camellia Panjabi and it changed my life. The ingredients and techniques are authentic and simple to follow. I have three pieces of advice. 1) Buy Camellia's book 2)Find a local indian food market 3) Prep all the food before you cook from this book, as the techniques are sometime fast. It will change your diet and appreciation for indian cuisine forever. Enjoy the life change!"
1,Hard to follow and poor organization,Along with this book I have two other cookbooks from this publisher and they are all bad. The only good thing about them is the pictures. But the recipes haven't been tested with real cooks in mind. Very poor organization...I have to practically read the entire book just to find out what some of the ingredients they call for are.
5,A Surprising Treasure,"I bought this book on a whim and we use it over and over. It iseasily read, followed and thus you pull it out when you feel like a curry and its condiments. This is a book you can use when you cook during the week as well as on weekends. That is atreat. I collect cookbooks, have taken lessons in India/Thailand and the books and recipes I returned with were not user friendly because of ingredients or technique. This one is. Kudos to the author for allowing us to share the joy of these culinary adventures."
5,info,The tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thankspat22pat@gmail.com
1,Tracfone has a lot of competition now,"Last year and even the beginning of this year I would have recommended tracfone to friends/family...that was before the At&t 2 Go Phone, it has more features; rings, text messaging, cheaper minutes, and free nights/weekends/holidays. The tracfone can no longer compete!"
1,Tracfone bad bad bad,"Web service, poorly setup, had to call to do any updates/addons.Call in phone service, outsourced, very poor, but they stonewall like no other, right up there with Liberty Wireless.Phone service, intermittent!Refund policy, the Greatest of Stonewalling, non-existant!Cost, starts at 50 cents a minute and doubles outside your area.Save your money and get a calling card or do without, just like you did years ago."
1,Tracfone is worthless,I made 2 mistakes:#1 Buying from Radio Shack. This company has the worst salespeople in the business and whatever is bought from them can allways be had elswhere at a better price.#2 Bought tracfone. Tracphones (gsm versions) will likely NOT work inside your house. According to tracfone having to walk down the street to use your phone is acceptable (yeah right). This company will tell lies only to call 1hr or 1 day later to hear a different lie. I dont care how cheap a service is why patronize this gross lack of service!
1,Tracfone - Can't recommend,"I recommended Tracfone 6 months ago to a cousin. Now I am ashamed. I recently used their obviously out sourced support team to try to change my number when I moved. So far I have been given 5 (FIVE)numbers (none work) and a lot of mis information. I was willing to accept roaming if nothing else worked. I have roaming on my phone now and I get a message saying the local carrier cannot accept my call. 6 months ago at the same location everything worked fine.The only reason I gave them one star was there was nothing lower available. Conside my frustration. My phone doesn't work at the location it once did, I've spent hours on the phone, Tracfone support has given me 5 different numbers, and still have no service."
1,Tracfone sucks big time!!!,"Zero stars!!!! I have had my Tracfone for 2 weeks - have made numerous calls to their so-called Customer Service - have spent most of the time on hold - and still have ""No Service"". I have not been able to send or receive any calls since I have had it. And beware - if you buy it and it does not work they will not refund your money - apparently in India they do not believe in standing behind their product. So now I have a totally worthless phone and am out the money I spent."
5,FREE MINUTES!!,"tracfone is a great company for anyone looking to get a contract free cellphone. because you can buy the minute cards anwhere this service is good even for kids. i would highly recommend their service to anyone especially if you have kids. with their new digital service you get free caller id an voicemail, which many of the other wireless service dont have. And if you are just activating your phone or even just reactivating you can get 100 free minutes by using the refer a friend service. you can email me at shivathediva2003@yahoo.com and i will send you a email and you can get a free 100 minutes. I hope that you find this review helpful. I also have the information on how to send ringtones to tracfone phones, which i will send with a referral"
1,"Forced ""wit"" sinks hackneyed AIDS plot","Coe's characters are shallow and immature. They might annoy you even if they were well-written, but they are not. Coe has no ear for dialogue--no one in real life says ""honey"" in three consecutive sentences. Worse, he constantly digresses into asides which are neither as witty or insightful as he thought they were. A much better novel dealing with some of the same themes is Gary Indiana's ""Gone Tomorrow."""
2,"Quick yes, Good, not so much",Very basic recipes that call for lots of processed foods. I never use this cookbook at all.
3,Okay but not what I was looking for,"My objective was simple-fast, small amount of common ingredients, appealing meal ideas.This book called for some strange ingredients, some of the recipes looked tedious, and I really just wasn't very attracted to any of the meal ideas in here. Not the type of food I am going to be able to get husband to eat either, so I wound up sending it back.I have had great success so far with a few other books:Diabetic Low-Fat & No Fat Meals in MinutesThe Busy People Series of cookbooks."
5,"Easy, not fussy, tasty, pleases even non-dieters/diabetics!","These recipes are easy, they use ""normal"" ingredients that you can find in even average grocery stores (I cannot find fancy gourmet ingredients where I live), and best of all--the recipes are tasty! This cookbook was recommended to me by our employee wellness program about six years ago, and I have enjoyed using it. I share with some folks who are not dieting or diabetic or otherwise particularly concerned about food issues, and they like the recipes too. That's high praise, and unusual for this type of food. The nutrition information, recipe alteration advice, and shopping list prep helps are nice features. You'll learn a lot in general, as well as having great recipes. Enjoy!"
4,About Time!,HeyI have just bought this cd and love it. I just wish there were more songs. I think they should have combined Two Tons and The Weather Girls since they are the same people. They should have put a song with Sylvester on here also. YOU ARE MY FRIEND is a good one. It's sad to note that Izora just passed away. So i am glad I have her voice on CD and will cherish it forever. Carry on Martha!All in all i love the songs especially the remake of LAUGHTER IN THE RAIN! I also love WELL A WIGGY it's a cute song with Izora growling it out ha ha. Another gem is BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY a very cool remake. And of course IT'S RAINING MEN! The classic Gay anthem ha ha.So if you wanna here booming voices along with choice beats then pick this up.
3,Drawings or Sketches?,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I expected detailed, color drawings. This book contains nice sketches of portraits that Sargent perhaps later painted. The reproductions are a little blurry, also. It is still a nice, inexpensive reference book to own."
3,Sargeant Portrait Drawings,A bit disappointing as there are few guidelines or words of instruction.Therese
4,A must for budding portrait artists...,"If you are interested in portraiture, you must pay homage to the best of all time, John Singer Sargent. It's difficult enough to get a decent likeness, but composition and capturing personality is what Sargent was able to do."
4,Will get the job done,"We all know its coming. Gas had just hit 4 dollars when i decided to get a lock, and the price will inevitably rise, 5 dollars, 6 dollars, 10 dollars per gallon. There is only so much oil in the world. I live in the city and I have a 25 Gallon gas tank. I forsee this lock functioning 2 fold, as a deterent, and as an actual lock. 10 bucks you cant go wrong, just make sure you goto the Stant website to make sure you are getting the right size, dont depend on amazon.com to tell you if it fits or not. I give it a 4 and not a 5 because i dont like the key and I would of liked to have seen it with a lanyard."
3,Does not fit,"Seems ok if it fits your rig, but it doesn't fit mine. My rig is listed, but the cap doesn't fit."
4,Locking gas cap- it works,"As expected. No stress tests or anything, but no gas stolen since it was installed either, so I'd take that as a win. Of course, I have no idea if anyone has tried."
4,Decent mono recordings of Dino's late 40's-early 50's tunes,"The sound quality on these mono recordings is generally quite good (on certain tracks I recommend turning down the bass for clearer sound, however). I was very skeptical of a 100 track set for such a nominal price, but I was very pleasantly suprised. Since the material is from the late 40's-early 50's, many of the tunes are a bit gimmicky and overly ""cute"" (similar to the stuff Mitch Miller forced Sinatra to record at the end of his contract with Columbia: see ""Momma Will Bark"") but others are absolute classics. I really enjoyed hearing the earlier version of ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime,"" (a different version than the one that made Dino ""Beatle-Buster Martin"" by knocking the Fab 4 out of the #1 slot in the 60's).I recommend this set as an excellent value for the price."
2,Small and poorly assembled,I purchased this bellows to stoke my charcoal BBQ. I quickly found it to be too small to serve as much more than a toy. The wooden grips are too narrow for my hands to grasp well and the puff of air it produces is small and brief. The brass pins began popping out of the leather right out of the box.
2,But Can It Take The Heat?,"The product has an excellent design but after only a couple of weeks of use it started to look a little torn up and burnt up, even though those of us using it in our household kept it well away from the flames. I can't recommend a better bellows due to the fact this is the first one I've needed to purchase, but I definitely think it could be built to tolerate heat a little better!"
1,USB-PRINT USB 1.1 to Print Adapter,"Does not work at all, if there is a driver required it is not included with the cables and cannot be downloaded anywhere. Useless."
5,"sequel to 'World of Carbon""","This follow up book is an excellent way to learn and understand organic chemistry. Each chapter expands on the previous to give on overall understanding of the change of properties added to a base chain or ring of carbon atoms.What I found was that both books were not just educational but also entertianing. But I did go on to study more chemistry, helped by what I learned in World of Nitrogen."
4,Camera Battery Review,The battery works great! I shopped at several online stores and Amazon had a fair price and with the free and quick shipping - it was the best deal. The camera now works with the new battery.
1,"Delays, delays, delays","This is more so a review of Amazon.com who was the ""seller"" of the product. It is now mid-November and I made the order back in August. I was informed there may be a delay. I'm a pretty patient person so I decided I could wait a month. Regardless, I was given two other delay notices. Now I'm cancelling the order.You'd think if they have the software programming capability to send you a delay notice, that Amazon could contact one of its vendors and say, ""you know what, we couldn't supply it, could you please ship the order.""Wow, how simple would that have been? Thank you for disrespecting my time and you lack of efficiency Amazon.-SB"
1,mad as hell,Why don't you send the damn thing to me? Or do you just take my money and then don't send anything?
4,"Good life, fair price.","I have 2 of these, the one that came with the Optio and this one as a spare. I find when traveling it pays to have 2 fully charged batteries before starting the day, especially when the camera requires a proprietary battery such as this one. I get about 100 high res shots out of the battery with the LCD on, maybe 150 with the LCD off. I feel the price is reasonable."
3,Smells horrible!,This is a great case for your MacBook. It is lightweight but very strong and has nicely padded sides that provide plenty of protection. It has handles and a shoulder strap. The color is great-bright and different from all the black cases out there.The only problem I have with it is the strong odor. It smells horrible! Very strong vinyl smell that took months to disipate. I actually left it outside for about 8 weeks before I could bring it in the house.If you are sensitive to odors- don't buy this case.
5,"Ashton, no sera el mismo pueblo...","Este es un libro muy bueno e intrigante, te lo recomiendo si vienes con intenciones de compra, Le abre uno los ojos acerca de la importancia de la guerra espiritual y el poder de la oración. Esto lo hace Peretti a través de una historia llena de suspenso y emociones, de verad es FULL !!!"
5,top quality live cd,"This is a top quality live. For fans and even newbies to In the Woods sound this is a prime example of what theyre all about, with songs from every stage in their career, and sounding top quality because of the great production work. Some of the songs sound better on this than they do on their original cds (see ""Heart of Ages""). Definately worth a purchase for fans of dark music, black metal, or just experimental, intelligent music ."
4,This book is really cool. it wasn't the best but good.,"it is really cool. Sabrina has to move this aquarium from the Mesmer mansion and carry it to her school. the principal, mr. kraft wants her to clean it so he can do some history thing. so mr. kraft helps sabrina start by pulling up some weeds. then sabrina sees little creatures and she goes into the aquarium and found the lost city of Atlantis. when the townspeople see her they think she's a conch queen come back to take the city back to the ""Endless waters"" Sabrina wants to but she doesn't know how to. and she doesn't know if someone wants the lost city to be found or not. it's really interesting so if ur gonna buy a book and u already have good switch bad switch or a dog's life or prisoner of cabin 13 then u should buy this."
4,"ok, could be more interesting","It kind of sounds better than it is. Not the best Sabrina book. The story and plot is cool though, if you want a new Sabrina book get Shamrock Shenanigans, Eight Spells a Week or All that Glitters. Those are real good! Now You See Her Now You Don't has a good plot."
2,Had to skip some pages...,I thought that it was boring when...well almost every part. I skipped some pages when Mesmer and Sabrina talked and other parts. I don't really care for who wrote it because it gets pretty boring on their books. It was pretty hard to even finish without thinking about something else rather than the book.
5,tassimo cleaning disc,"my original disc disappered.... i bought this one and it works as well as the original one. the color of the disc is yellow, which makes no difference"
2,Not great,"disc is for cleaning, but gets jammed up with the old grinds trying to come through. We stopped using the tassimo alltogether."
3,Works as expected,"Bought this replacement disc after losing the original that can with our Braun. It works just fine, though I think its overpriced considering its just a piece of molded plastic with a bar-code on it."
1,Read the fine print!,"It is very misleading that this is called ""Rainy Day Dora"" and is pictured with a Dora doll. It should have the word ""outfit"", ""clothes"" or ""ensemble"" in it. IT IS ONLY THE ACCESSORIES - No doll included."
4,Texas Knows How To Rock,"Most people outside of Austin and South Texas have never heard of Vallejo. Into The New is the best way to introduce new listeners to these brothers from Austin. I have seen them perform, and they are truly a kickin' band. They don't play the typical whining alternative, but a fast up beat sound that gets you wanting to jump around. This is a great CD to have for when you drive anywhere, and this is a CD everybody can listen to."
3,Too Much Going On,"Texas band Vallejo is usually adept at mixing rock,blues,funk & anything else with a southern feel. On Into The New they take their ideas a little too far. The title track puts their confident rock together with extra electronic production that just does not work. That theme repeats itself a lot, as even better numbers like the heavy ""Modern Day Slave"" are sabotaged by a techno-rap ending. The acoustic ""Back In The Day"" and the superfly-funk of ""Let It Slide"" show what they're really capable of, without electronic hijinx. Their brand of earthy rock is good enough on its own without trying to ""update"" it."
2,Marketing Research,"The book was in ok condition. However, it was an international edition, which I did not enter an ISBN for. Also, the cd which came with the book was broken into many pieces when I received it."
5,The only ski instructor worth knowing,"This book is your personal ski instructor - its clear, comprehensible, sympathetic to your inabilties but best of all it is the only instructor that says the same thing every year. I can quite truthfully claim that this book has single-handedly transformed my skiing and I wouldn't be seen on the piste without it."
2,Pretty much un-readable,"Although there are a few good nuggets in this book I found it practically unreadable.First, the lack of visuals. There are a few figures in the book but they are hand drawn and not very informative. That means you've got to understand everything from the text. Why not use photographs liberally to SHOW what you mean rather than just describe it.Contrast this book with Harold Harb's new book ""Anyone can be an expert skier"", or Warren Witherall's ""The Athletic Skier"" and you'll know what I mean.Second, and this might be trivial to a lot of people, but I thought the font was horrible. Why use a helvitica font when you could use a times roman font? It is MUCH harder to read. The pages have no white-space.So, bottom line, I would NOT recommend this to someone looking for that proverbial breakthrough. It is a nice supplemant to other books such as Harb's and Witherall's books on skiing."
3,Lou Gehrig's rawhide ver,"this was interesting to watch. If he were still alive I would have to say, he was a better ball player thanan actor, no academy award, but an honorable mention for trying. I'm glad it was hisonly time. I did like the movie, and it is in my library to keep"
4,Needs Restoration,"The only bad thing about this movie is that it needs restoration, badly. Other than that its a quick watch and extremely entertaining. The one big surprise and biggest enjoyment of this film is Lou Gehrig. He's a really good actor in this, not wooden at all as I first expected. The part where he sings/lip syncs is hilarious."
5,Good fun,"This is simply good fun. It's neat to see Lou Gehrig as a cowboy, and the songs are cute and the story well-rounded."
4,Not everyone who reads the Dake Study Bible listens to U2.,Yes. There are certainly alot of newer Dake readers who appreciate U2. I agree. There are still a bunch of the old school Dake readers who don't go for Rock and Roll music. This study Bible is appropriate for the old school folks as well. Even if you don't agree with every tenet of Dake-Bonoism I wouldn't let that keep you from taking advantage of this great study bible. The study notes on the curse of Ham are worth the price of the bible alone.
5,This is where everything starts!,"Dake's teaching on the bible has had a large impact on the contemporary Christian music. His music has even influenced such ""secular"" artists Bono of the musical group U2. Many people have found parallel's between Bono's lyrics and Rev. Dake's teaching on the curse of Ham.If you only have one book this is the one you'll need."
3,Boring,"Even though it won a Pulitzer prize, I found Undset's long descriptive passages boring. I would like the story to move faster, although I admit that her descriptions are beautiful. I just found them tiresome."
1,Garbage,"I found this book worse than bad -- it's not just useless but if you follow its advice I suspect it's harmful. I followed the model from Dr. Sears' books in doing attachment parenting for my child from birth to now (he is six). I bought this book because it was the first book I saw which purported to describe how ""attachment parenting"" could be applied past 6 years old. But this book is essentially just a collection of the author's personal opinions about what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong"". The book cites neither to any research nor even to the author's personal experience. And even as to the author's opinions I found them contrary to the spirit and praxis of attachment parenting."
2,Don't spend your money in this book.,This book its no bad for beginer but its not a great book for learn about microeconomics.
3,Good for some laughs,"There is no doubting that Nana has a nice vocal tone. However the woman cannot hold a tune for her life. It is amusing to hear her do various covers on this album and wonder what the original artists must think when they have heard Nana's rendition. Also, another hysterical part of this and many of Mouskouri's recordings is that the microphone seems to have been placed inside the Greek chanteuse's mouth during recording as you can hear every smack of her lips and sounds of popping saliva.Nana is a very bad singer with a very nice voice.She could have had exponentially more success if someone had really worked with her and taught her to sing."
5,"""Even Now"" alone makes this CD worth purchasing.","I first heard Nana Mouskouri's angelic voice on a public radio ""easy listening"" station. ""Even Now"" was the song, and I was astounded at the range, purity, and feeling in the voice and style. This piece seems the quintessential love song by a singer of it that will never be surpassed. I am thankful to Barry Manilow for writing the song, but Nana Mouskouri is the one who gives it life. I can hardly believe that I only discovered her this late in her career. The variety on the CD is wonderful, but just hearing ""Even Now"" is a breathtaking experience."
5,Where has this lady been?,"I heard Nana the first time on televison on the radio programs. She made me stop what I was doing to listen. When I saw who she was, I went right to Amazon and looked her up. There was a big selection of CD's of her, so I ordered a couple. I love her very beautiful and unique sound. She is great! This is my favorite CD of her. The song selection is beautiful."
5,ONE OF THE BEST VOICES EVER,"NANA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS. SHE PUTS YOU IN TRANCE...THE MUSIC AND THE MESSAGE OF HER WORDS ARE BEYOND THIS WORLD...SHE IS FROMTHE REALM OF PEACE, JOY AND LOVE..."
2,"nice voice, poor arrangements","Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable. She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra. Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and again."
3,It definetly creates volume...,"i like that you don't have to use a lot of it, but it leaves your hair with a crunchy feel. it makes your hair big, but weighs it down at the same time. it's definetly not my first choice, but not horrible."
4,terrific bargain-no complaints so far,"The reason I chose this printer was that I had over 100.00 invested in cartridges (34 &35) when my old Lexmark 4350 died.. I researched and found this printer that took the same cartridges-was amazed at the reasonable price!I've been using it daily for the few weeks I've had it; it prints faster than my previous Lexmark, and the tray that feeds items for copying is handy. Note to cat owners: control buttons are easily accessible by our feline friends-beware if you will be using this for incoming faxes, because the settings WILL be changed :)"
5,Amazing product,"This is the perfect home office unit. Small space required, very functional, easy to setup and use. And the cost, fantastic. Nobody could believe what I paid."
1,This printer is not compatible with Windows Vista,Its too late for me to return it and I even used Lexmark support to no avail. I will not ever purchase another Lexmark. The printer and company blows.
3,"Good, but note that the original was written in 1978","This A-Z book describes around 70 vegetables and provides recipes. The book was written in 1978 and describes what was available in the UK at the time. Since English food used to be terrible a bit of history is also provided about vegetables popularised after the Second World War. The only illustrations in the book are some line drawings. The descriptions and recipes are still good, but naturally more variety is available 30 years later. Recommended if you are really into vegetables. Definitely recommended if you are interested in UK food writing history."
5,La Casa Grande!!!!!!!!,"When you are done with this book you will taste the soot, feal the heat and exhaustion and know what it was like to be a grunt firefighter on the streets of the South Bronx with the FDNY during the ""WAR Years"" of the late 60's and early 70's. Dennis Smith's first hand accounts of the busiest fire engine EVER {over 9,000 runs in just 1 year} will leave you captivated and ready to Take the test........to join Engine 82!!"
5,Excellent Book! A must have for any fire service enthusiast.,"Dennis Smith takes us into a world seldom seen by the average person. His accounts are gripping and have you believe you're on the hoseline backing up the nozzleman. It is a truly captivating book that shows the reader what really is the root of urban decay.As a fellow firefighter, I couldn't put this book down and have re-read it several times. It is a timeless piece that shows what it's like to be a New York City firefighter. I recommend this to everybody."
5,A good look back,"During the tumultuous period of the 60s when author Dennis Smith wrote Report From Engine Company 82, the book was a cry for help from exhausted, frustrated men. Men who cleaned up in the aftermath of other exhausted and frustrated inhabitants of a society stretched to the breaking point.As I type this, a younger firefighter in a comfortable, air-conditioned fire station among a population that by-and-large respects my profession, it's easy to forget the sacrifice of our past brothers who unceasingly fought fires, city hall and the population they served, until they had forged the modern fire service.It's an important book for new firefighters to learn how the iron men of old did the job. And for the general reader it's a testament to both a volatile period in our nation's history, and to the timeless strength and courage by which good men have always worked to keep back the chaos of barbarism and destruction."
4,As advertised from seller. Good story at first but kinda drug before it was over.,"The book was as advertised from seller and quickly shipped.As for the story, it started out really interesting but sort of began to drag towards the end of the book, but I'm not sure why."
5,Big Up Big Up!!!!,"Sizzla Kalonji!!! represent truth and righteousness...... saw him in person in ny when this come out....truly in live. this is good as all his previous ones. lyrics always inspire and uplift. cd is produced by fattis...so u know it. special bonus is the bonus cd, him live in UK, with songs like prise ye jah, black woman & child, and babylon ah listen. favorite tracks on cd- enemies are confounded and think positive. Only (minor) thing about cd is that there is a little less variety on the tracks. all a tem fast and typical sizzla. no slow or diffent tracks like on royal son. nuff respect and bless........"
5,blessed love,this is sizzla best yet i love the songs and the rhythm this one is a classic so is be i strong and his other old one's such as black woman and child ilove sizzla music and his vibes all of you sizzla fans out there this is a got to have album keep the faith and praise jah always blesed love rastafari
5,Editorial Nonsense,"Anyone who listens to a Rebecca LEVINE commenting on REGGAE (THE NERVE!!) is not in the know. The message is perfect, the method is also perfect. If you don't have the background, you will not understand. Let's get some qualified people to comment in this forum. That album and all it says sings perfectly to me."

1,Better Books Available,"For lovers of Dickens and those who wish to know more about the alleged affair between Ellen Ternan and Charles Dickens, you will fair far better bypassing Rackham's, The Rag and Bone Shop and sticking with non-fiction. I have given this work one star because anything less is unavailable but to be frank, the book is absolutely terrible. Telling a single story from three differing points of view works well for William Faulkner but not for Rackham as all three voices sound very male and very much the same. The book contains very explicit and bizarre sexual situations and if you have any respect for Dickens at all, you'll feel like you need a shower afterwards. Furthermore, even as a ""novel,"" the historicity and credibility of these events is highly suspect. Skip it."
1,Bah Humbug,"I couldn't finish this book and regret reading as much as I did. Vulgar, name dropping, coat-tail riding, rewriting someone else's story with inserted titallating bits. I gather there's no law against slandering people who lived 100 years ago, but this book makes you feel that there should. The publishers, though they plastered Charles Dickens name on the cover, wrote a disclaimer on the inside that this is fiction and any resemblance to real persons is just coincidence. Yea Right. If you want to read about Dickens' secret life, you'd be far better to read Invisible Woman by Claire Tomalin."
2,Falls Short of Description,"Product does look like what is pictured, but measurements are off and fall short of what was needed or expected. Described as 2"" X 14"". Stone fence pieces were barely 1"" tall and stone fence posts measure barely over 1-1/4"" tall. I was counting on the whole fence being at least 2"" tall for my village area. It will have to do, but I would not have purchased it had I known it was that small."
4,Sashimi of Post-Modernity,"This collection of poems, especially the title poem, is jarring and bewildering in its swiftness and complexity, and in the crossed-paths of struggle, you will encounter spectacular images and conclusions. The images like ""now from the unbuttoned corner moving out"" and ""recurring wave of arrival"" are vividly childlike and nostalgic but also remind me of nothing I have encountered before. Ashberry's images sometimes bang against each other like the organized chaos of bumper cars. If you find yourself lost, keep reading and re-reading, no one needs to point out subtlety. Stick around, the confusion and overlapping delay the release at the end of his movements, which rival T.S. Eliot, in their polite, mythic send-offs."
1,Through a Glass Murky,"A confounding, self-indulgent collection by America's master of Poetica Obscura.As a teacher of literature and a poetry lover since childhood, I've read thousands upon thousands of poems from a number of poets of a number of languages, and I'll be blasted if this is not the first time I got absolutely NOTHING out of reading a book of poems. In fact the only line from this one that I recall is ""I let a guy blow me once.""It is this personalization of verse (to the extreme, where ""feeling"" becomes more important than meaning) that has destroyed poetry as a popular art form in this country. (One can scarcely imagine asking someone to memorize and recite anything from this book.)Give me Richard Wilbur or even Sarah Teasdale any time. Shoot, I'll even take Rod McKuen at this point.A Pulitzer for this? Say it ain't so, Joe!"
1,Jim Mc Intyre,"Those who have read only the usual accounts of the American War of Independence will be illuminated by Harry M. Ward's recent book, Between the Lines. The book offers a series of glimpses into the very violent, and often criminal world of the civil war within the American War of Independence.Thus, Ward looks at the various gangs of outlaws, sometimes affiliated with one side or the other, sometimes out only for personal gain, who raided the civilians between the British and Contintental Armies.While the book gives a good overview, Ward does not really attempt to understasnd his topic, there is little interpretation here. Likewise, he does not look at what was happening on the frontier, or at privateering.Finally, while Between the Lines will make a good read for anyone, Ward is a very strong narrative writer, it will be most beneficial to new students of the War of Independence."
3,There's so much good stuff here....tainted by marketing,"Ford has so many good things to say. I love her for making the shadow a safe place for so many of us that have felt the need to shut parts of oursleves off.That being said, I feel her message is tainted by her over-marketing and over-pricing of her products (that can only be found on her website). One each of these cards there is a marketing pitch for one of her other products. I wish people in the healing field can come to the understanding that what they do calls for a higher level of integrity.There is also a cultish energy around her staff and the people that work for her.This kind of over-marketing taints their message."
5,A Great Companion,"This kit is a great companion to The Best Year of Your Life Book! Inspiring, encouraging, and motivating."
3,It couldn't have been done without endorsements!,"My first reaction was why would anyone want to take two very young children on such a trail? The logistics alone were death-defying: baby food, cloth diapers...and five years to complete the struggle. Couldn't they have waited until the kids were potty-trained?Although nicely written, with a unique topic, I'm not sure I can admire people who undertake such endeavors because they have to beg corporations for the finanicial support. And that alone makes one dependent on someone or something else to finish such a journey. I got the feeling at times the book was to endorse pack animals rather than hiking with young children through the wilderness."
1,A Dissapointment,"When i first saw this book on the bookshelf I was excited about reading the very appealing story of this family and the way they journeyed along the Contintental Divide Trail. I very much enjoy reading outdoor adventure books such as Bill Bryson's ""A Walk In the Woods"" and Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"". Both excellent and well written stories.I picked up this book with similar expectations. I was very dissapointed to say the least. The story was redundent, not well written and extremely self-indulgent. Another problem I had with this book was the constant projection of thoughts and feelings onto her husband and children. Instead of telling a compelling story of long distance hiking with her familiy, friends and llamas, the author tries too hard to create a platform for her contrived introspection. She ends up portraying herself as very narcissistic.My recommendation: Save your money."
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward to the delivery of this book, but was sorely disappointed when it finally arrived. Both my husband and I--avid travelers, backpackers, and outdoorspeople--were annoyed with the amount of time Cindy Ross spends complaining about the trail conditions and her husband's lack of affection for her. In addition, this book is repetitive and at times poorly written.The story itself is an interesting one, but too much time is spent psychoanalyzing--and, even worse, complaining--about other people's feelings, actions, etc. We came away from the book feeling as if Ross felt that she was above others, that everyone else's opinions and feelings--like Todd's, on the trail; and Bob's at times; and her relatives who hike with them for a short time--were not as important as her own.In short, this book disappointed us from beginning to end."
2,Tough listen,"The majority of the tracks are a tedious drag. I found myself praying for the songs to be over. The one notable exception is the remix of ""Tainted Love"" which was tastefully redone... My opinion is that Soft Cell is a synth-pop hack of a band. For a ""greatest hits"" compilation, it really stinks."
4,Just what I wanted,"I needed this book for Animation 101 at DigiPen, and it was exactly what I needed and at a great price."
4,Good basic introduction to animation,"Animation 1: Learn to Animate Cartoons Step by Step lives up to its title. It's a good introduction to the concepts and techniques in animation ""old school"" style. Don't look for techniques in CGI like Maya and Blender or for 2D animation using Photoshop or Toonz or Anime Studio or ToonBoom Animate. This is ""nuts and bolts"" take out the pencil and paper and draw. Liked the book - relatively inexpensive and the lessons were good and straightforward."
3,good book but only if you're already a good artist,This book assumes that you can already draw well and you're comfortable drawing n-turns of characters. I wish it broke down tips of shaping a character and the angles better. The book is also huge! I mean it's the size of a souvenir book. So don't count of reading in on the subway. Great help for you artists that can already figure draw though!
4,Good and Basic,"A good and basic introduction to some of the essential elements of animation.It is not for Flash animators. There are no specifics about keyframes, no tips and tricks for ""tweens"", and nothing nuts and bolts about creating your own animation using the common elements found in most desktop animation software.But he did point out some basic rules that apply to all cartooning, so...it was worth the time."
5,A good bat holder,"For the price, you can't find a better bat rack. Very good build quality. Overall a great buy."
4,zebrahead is great,"..but this CD is just not as good as their first one. The same elements are there, but it has changed a little. ""I'm money"" is pretty funny, and they even get serious on a few tracks. Overall, I really liked this CD but the first one was better and now I listen to it more. The CD art on this album is almost worth the price of admission."
4,CATCHY,"This is a great album by great musicians. All the songs have a different feel. The best songs are: I'm Money (a really catchy yet simple sounding song), What's Going On (almost the most lyrically touching song ever written about teenage violence...), and The Hell that is My Life (Funny and fun to listen too. A definite summer song). Incredible to say the least."
4,solid follow up,"This album is tight, the songs are well written and well produced. They are a bit more radio-friendly this time around, with less rapping and more actual singing, and so while they may have lost a bit of their edge, they still sound good and hopefully they can broaden their audience with these catchy tunes. If you were a fan of the first album, you will probably like this one."
2,Not as Good as Their Last,This CD kind of dissapointed me when I first listened to it. It doesn't have as much edge and catchy sound as their last album. Their rapper Ali doesn't rap as much as Justin sings in this one. To tell you the truth i think Justin's voice is pretty annoying after listening to it for a while. This CD has a few good songs like playmate of the year and others but its not near as good as thier last cd.
2,NOT Waste of Mind!,"This CD went way way too mainstream. It has more the flavor of Blink 182 or something. Theres not enough funk, too much punk. Zebrahead is composed of two singers, the rapper and the singer. But Ali (the singer) has such a high pitched voice, it gets annoying without the lower, quicker rapper to balance the sound out, and he does most of the singing on this cd. Playmate of the year just didnt hold up to their previous album, my most fave, Waste of Mind."
5,Very good!,I think I'm very lucky to get this item. I recommend you to buy this book and read it. Remember that the book is written in NOT simplified Chinese BUT traditional Chinese. Thank you for sending me the great book.
4,Worked OK,"This faceplate worked ok, but I did notice that the color was slightly different than Ivory plate colors that the electricians on my project were using. The Keystone type jacks I used went in fine, and none of the faceplates were damaged or anything like that when I received them."
3,"Nice necklace, but big...","Necklace itself is great, looks nice, good quality. However, it is pretty big. Not necessarily bad, but just keep that in mind when ordering."
5,American Dad Vol.2,"If you enjoy Family Guy, you will love American Dad! Similar with funny political undertones!"
4,Very Funny,Contains some of the best work. I usually noctice that in TV series the best episodes/seasons are the 2nd-5th (assuming its 7+ seasons) Lots of good episodes on here
2,"Interesting ideas, poor execution: read ""Heart of the Comet""","I've read several of Greg Benford's novels, and although this novel tackles some interesting ideas, on the whole it is sketchy, underdeveloped and lacks continuity. This might have been more entertaining if the authors had stuck with one segment and worked through it. The action is nonexsistent, extended over nearly one hundred years and broken up into 20-25 page chapters for each time period. The characters are few, two-dimensional, and unsympathetic. Plotlines are too many and undeveloped, (none of the aliens stick around for more than a few pages, nothing is taken to any kind of a logical conclusion.) Finally, there is a very unsatisfying ending. You might want to try reading ""Heart of the comet,"" which Benford co-wrote with David Brin."
3,The authors can't agree on the hero's age...................,"Yeah, I'm nitpicking, but there sure is an age discrepency in the 2nd and in the next to last parts of the book. In the 2nd part, he's in his fifties, but his age as stated doesn't agree with his age at the beginning, using the dates assigned to each part. And in the next to last part, His age is given first as 95 (which agrees with the time frame} and at the mid point as 127.Small detail, but indicative that this book gives an appearance of not being well planned. It has an interesting concept which appeals to my metaphysical nature, but it just doesn't follow through. All the same, it is a good read for the heavy science-fiction reader, but not recommended to the more discerning."
5,Reviewing CHOCOLATE COVERED FROG LEGS AND GO ASK MOM,"In the capacity of children's librarian,I recently purchased two Justin Matott books for our collection: GO ASK MOM and CHOCOLATE COVERED FROG LEGS. Young children will relate well to some of the adventures(and misadventures) of Gabriel Peters in GO ASK MOM. Gabriel""survives"" and grows, which is comforting to children who also faceobstacles of all sorts. It is an entertaining book that probably would result in children happily extending their 20 minute ""required night reading time .""Children enjoy poems. The many humorous, imaginative, philosophical,and instructive rhymes in CHOCOLATE COVERED FROG aregreat for ""kids of all ages."" I thoroughly enjoyed my first time through the book and look forward to reading the poems again."
5,traffic,this is truely a greatcolaboration of traffics great music. it also shows how the band music changed from the 60's to the 70's/
4,50 mins of free time..,"I just got my new TracFone in July, I got me a 150 min card.Went on there web site actvate my phone and got 10 free minsfor that 10 free mins for new activation and 30 free minswith the promo code.30+10+10 = 50 free minsI love this phone and the plan is great.also this is my first cell phone too."
3,Road Warriors Friend,"I have had a TracFone for 7 months. I think it is a fine product/service. I realize that I am only giving this product (TracFone 300 minute phonecard) 3 stars, that is because average cell phone users use more than 300 or even 500 minutes a month. It is ideal for a small market of low usage consumers. However, it may be even better suited for a larger market of those who travel across the country constantly. Roaming charges on a standard cell/digital phone service plan can get very expensive and may not have true nationwide service. The reason I purchased the TracFone 7 months ago was for the event of an emergency while traveling on vacation across a number of states. No contracts, and nationwide coverage. I will continue to keep my TracFone activated on a yearly basis for less than a ""few bucks"" month with the Plus 3 card, as vacations are an annual event. I will also purchase other 120 and 300 minute phone cards for their value. Thank you."
1,"Avoid Tracfone. They ""deactivated"" my prepaid cards!","At first, I liked Tracfone, right up until they deactivated all of the ""Plus3"" prepaid airtime cards I'd purchased from Amazon by ""discontinuing"" this product. They purposefully made the cards unuseable, by removing the PIN numbers from their system.What this means is that purchasers of ANY prepaid Tracfone Airtime card product that Tracfone decides to ""discontinue"" will have bought worthless cards!...This is what happened to me, and to a friend who also purchased these ""prepaid"" airtime Tracfone cards.I will never do business with a company like Tracfone again!...I hope this does not happen to you."
2,"Works OK, customer service aweful","If you never have a problem then life is good. Problem is that cell phones in general always have problems crop up- roaming being the biggest issue.Another problem is that the advertising for minute plans are often misleading to inaccurate. I imagine this helps them turn a profit because people get sick of trying to call them to get problems rectified.Do a Google search and you will see sites collecting customer complaints. I still recommend it, I still use it. But there are great big caveats."
5,excellent deal,"This is a great price for a tracfeon card. I prefer the tracfone because you pay as you go. Only spend as much as you can afford, no need to go into debt for a cell phone. They have great CS and an awesome website !!"
4,Tracfone - Problem solved by self service.,Good product TERRIBLE service. Could not activate online however customer service will give 10 bonus min. If you get through. Second phone I got for my wife de-activated 4 days after start. Web site was useless and could not get through to cust serv. E-mails returned said to call cust serv. I HATE LOOPS! Read reviews and got scared. One review I read said to use new activation line on phone site to get a person. I did not get a person however I did get a prompt to activate the phone so I gave it a try. It worked! Problem solved for now.
4,nice prepaid service,"I have been using tracfone for seven months and I am satisfied with it. I have light cell phone usage and it costs me less than 15 dollars a month. The signal is good, no matter in the city of Boston or in the countryside of PA. I have not dealt with their custom service though. Tracfone has a promotion of 120 free minutes if you get an invitation from other users before you activate it. Let me know if you need one. And I can help you even if you have already activated it recently."
2,Strike king glass minnow,"I was not happy with this product, the tails came off in my box. Product arrived in a timly manner, and were what i wanted."
5,Good Book,This book was very helpful to enable me to see that there are certain exceptions to what seem to be absolute prohibitions in the Bible regarding divorce and remarriage. Highly recommended.
2,Very disappointing,"First of all, this book is only 96 pages of very large print long, and half of that is full-page, glossy photos that are pretty, but don't impart any information. The basic information is worthwhile, but it can all be found on the internet for free. To top it off, the suppliers of chemicals listed in this book are all companies who only supply Revlon or MaxFactor, not you and me; they have ""10 drum"" minimum orders and so on, making it impossible for the average person to actually purchase the necessary ingredients. The only exception is The Somerset Company, but they don't have everything and never, ever answer the phone. An excercise in frustration and disappointment."
1,Very Disappointing & Misleading!,"As another reader commented ... the book is only 96 pages. A very misleading fact to say the least .. it states 114 pages. Is that where the wonderful recipes and valuable information is ... in the missing pages! Yes, it has slick pages and color photos ... but does not impart much useful recipes or formulas. If I could give it a negitive star rating I would! I have bought many books through Amazon ... this was a bust ... will return for credit!"
4,Cheaper on Ebay,"I like the overall looks of my stereo, very cool!!!!!!!! For how my parents spent on it, $399.00 ouch! But it's on Ebay for less, but it's worth the money. Plays mp3's so I have music for hours."
1,Stay Away!,"This system is WAY too expensive. I considered buying one until i actually heard it.There is NO BASS!!! So you have to buy a subwoofer if you want good sound from it.If you add it up(400 for the stereo, 300 for a decent subwoofer) 700 BUCKS!"
1,What now?,"Arrived rolled up with no other packaging and no instructions. Unless you already work with this stuff regularly, don't expect it to come with any helpful tips on how to cut, use or install it. Also I agree with other commenter that this is definitely off-white, not white."
5,Just What I was Looking For,Purchased because I had bought the wrong size elswhere. This was perfect and the 100' roll was what I needed.
3,Vinyl Insert,"This wasn't made by Camco. It wasn't as thick as the Camco insert I bought at Camping World. It works, but not as good quality. I returned it to Amazon."
4,Top Murder Mystery,"A Kiss Before DyingRobert Wagner is mean and nasty when, upon finding out that his college sweetheart, Joanne Woodward, was pregnant and wanted to get married, kills her by throwing her off a roof and hides the crime. The crime is hidden as a suicide. If that were not bad enough, he then pursues and woos the victim's sister because he wants to get married and get into the family business and fortune. It's a cat and mouse game throughout the movie, as Wagner gets engaged to the victim's sister, until an investigator finds out the Wagner knew her sister at college beofre she died.The movie comes to a suspenseful climax. I would recommend this DVD as a keepsake."
3,Better than the second version.,"This first version is better than the second one ( Filmed in 91 ). It's more like Ira Levin's book. Wagner and Woodward's performance are absolutely perfect. If you're fan of Ira Levin's book, I recommend this first version to watch first."
4,A nasty little gem,"Stunningly photographed in rich, deep technicolor, and with the delicious contrast between the sweet surface of the privileged white middle classes in the fifties and the poisonous, murderous greed of some young, imperiousness and stupidity of some parents, and the shallowness of a gross materialistic society wallowing in its consumption of goods, it is a little gem worthy of comparison to Hitchcock. A film to be relished."
3,Dated but Amusing,"Skinny, sociopathic pretty boy Robert Wagner accidentally knocks dopey, rich girl Dori (Joanne Woodward. He does the right thing by sociopath standards and makes her death look like a suicide. But her suspicious sister and Jeffrey Hunter (who apparently thinks he's Clark Kent) aren't convinced she took her own life. While the acting is on the bad side and I found myself laughing more than a few times during the film I did enjoy it. For me the most interesting part of it was seeing Jeffrey Hunter as someone other than Capt. Christopher Pike from the original Star Trek. Oh, and the cars... there's some cool cars in this film. But aside from that it does feel dated and a bit slow by today's standards. Some old movies like The Third Man, for example, hold up well after 50+ years. Others like this one... not so much although it does have at least one valuable life lesson in it: Girls who question whether or not their fiances are insane live, those who don't die."
3,Can we sydicate for this book,"Conk computers ltd 8 okigwe road aba Tel:234-82-233554 abia State Nigeria,Dear Author , We have not seen this book in the part of the Nigeria were I live, we have a computer school can we syndicate your interest on the area of sales in Nigeria. We have the Market here to sell this book and others for you. Thanks Hon Nddukwe cosmos"
5,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe","There's something here to offend entire demographic populations. I really dig that about this show! Both seasons are fantastic, but this one is better because it's not just the 3 of them bugging each other. There's more interaction with the outside world. Bernard gets a date!!?? WTF!!! MANNY gets a date! Omigah! Watch it drunk; watch it sober. It's all good. And, apparently, there's a season 3. Bring it on."
2,Didn't Really Do a Good Job,I tried to use it to repair the minor crack of the fiber glass of my Vette but it didn't really do a good job there.
2,TOO SMALL,"I got 15.5 x 5 inch, non-stick. I was really looking forward to making madeleinewith this sheet, but it was TOO SMALL to make soft, fluffy madeleine cookies. Like other people said, bigger pans should do a better job! I will probably getChicago Metallic 12-Cup Nonstick Madeleine Pan."
5,The Perfect Madeleines,"This pan provided a wonderful light golden color to the madeleines. I recommended using a spread of 1 tablespoon of melted butter and 1 tablespoon of flour mixed and brushed on to the molds. This made them virtually nonstick and added wonderfully to the color and taste. This product is wonderful, I might have to order a second one since my recipe always yields 2 batches!!"
1,Very disasppointed - Elastomoule product better,"I made Madeleine cookies using this pan and also my Elastomoule pan. What a HUGE difference. The cookies made using the Elastomoule pan were perfect - looked like they came from a French bakery. The cookies made using this pan were hard to get out of the mold - even though I thoroughly buttered as suggested. They also had a very brown look to them. In fairness, they did taste the same but they sure didn't look anywhere near as good. I do NOT like this pan and plan on trying to sell it and purchase another Elastomoule pan."
5,jmcgovern,"Excellent! Buy 2 pans if you plan on making any as most recipes will make 2 dozen or more standard sized madelienes. I got perfect results with these pans, I use 'PAM for Bsking' spray instead of buttering & flouring each shell which saves time & they clean up beautifully. Wash by hand, don't put in the dishwasher. I also bought 2 of the smaller mini-madeline pans by the same manufacturer & highly recommed those as well."
4,Self-Portrait of an Egotist,"Famed lawyer Melvin Belli has produced a lively life story. It is a revealing self-portrait of a supreme egotist. In both his personal life and his legal career, according to his own book, it is all about winning, and ultimately all about Melvin Belli. To his credit, he appears to have considerable skill as a courtroom lawyer, and no doubt some of it was applied to good causes. But there appears to be no higher moral principle in his legal cases than winning big-money verdicts and running up the Jolly Roger flag once more above his law office. There is no higher moral principle displayed in his private life than running up multiple wives and multiple philandering. It's all about Melvin.I liked the book. It is most entertaining, and I have no reason to doubt its accuracy. By the end, I didn't like the person who wrote it. But it's a good book."
4,keep an open mind if thinking about divorce...,"If you are looking for an alternative view or a Biblical based view about marriage and divorce, this book offers helpful insight. Great book as long as you remain open minded and are really serious about how to save your marriage instead of end it."
4,Different than I expected,"This novel is told by Dr. Haggard and relates his love of and affair with a superior doctor's wife during the 1930's in London and the later aftermath of his life in a small seaside town. The last 30-pages of this novel changed my opinion of the entire book. Although well-written, I saw the first part of the novel as a rehash of an obsession theme reminiscent of The End of the Affair or Lolita. The powerful ending made me completely rethink the entire novel and I found myself refelcting on the book long after I finished it. Well-crafted, disturbing, and deftly executed."
3,Exhausted by 'Love',"A furtive back-street affair becomes the Love of the Ages in the addled mind of a morphia addict. Never does Dr. Haggard seem to realize the truth: that his amour never really loved him and that he loved her in fantasy, not reality.The perverse development of the doctor's attraction to the woman's son (and his so-called 'disease') give this Gothic nail-biter a creepy overtone that culminates in a scene of inspired madness."
4,Obligatory McGrath descent into crazy,"A doctor with a bad hip and hella morphia addiction meets the son of the lady he loved and lost years earlier. McGrath is awesome when it comes to delusional demented characters and their descent into insanity. Still not quite sure what happened at the end, but it was freaky."
2,Too small,Good squeegie only for a small window. Well made but way too small. Good quality but not wide enough for me.
4,Love the size!,"I have a shower with glass doors and I like to use a squeegee to remove the excess water after every shower. My shower has about 7 different panels, the smallest measuring about 8inch. Most of the squeegee now on the market are measuring much large, which made it difficult to remove the water. I tried about 4 different squeegees before purchasing this one and I love The Home Pro Shower Squeegee!! Perfect size and great with removing water. Only slight down fall for me is, I wish there was a suction cup attachment or the hole was in the top center to hang on my shower caddy."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read,"This is the worst book ever written. Herman Melville wrote this book and then hid it himself because he was so ashamed of its lack of plot, tangled metaphors, idiotic characters, and ridiculously slow pacing. At the 'high point' of the book, when Billy Budd is hung, the reader feels only a wonderful sense of relief and a profound sense of joy in the knowladge that the book will be over soon. I would advise you not to waste your money on this book unless perhaps there is a national toilet paper shortage"
1,The most boring book ever written.,"Despite the decent storyline behind all of the wordiness, Billy Budd is a complete waste of time. Because of the complex symbolism (which Melville obviously tried entirely too hard to create), a book that should take a few hours to read turns into a fall into an abyss of three weeks full of confusion and frustration. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep, as it did to me several times, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book filled with action and less wordiness, I would advise you to look elsewhere."
1,"Billy ""Dud""","After taking three weeks to read this hundred or so page book, I was perplexed. The whole book does not have a plot. Melville's development of character is horrendous. He made it as if readers are supposed to already know who Billy Budd or John Claggart is. If it were not for the Cliff Notes, perhaps, no not perhaps, no one would understand what in the world is going on. The book is not in depth enough. THANK HEAVENS there is not a Billy Budd 2."
1,Another so called 'classic',"This is the hardest eighty pages I've ever read in my life. It's practically written in it's own language. A good concept hides behind this book. Unfortunately, the plane blows up in the hanger before it even gets to the runway. Melville has a unique rating writing; he tells something very interesting into something not worth your time. Stay away!"
1,A novella that is pure rubbish.,"""Billy Budd and Other Tales"" - this review is for ""Billy Budd."" Herman Melville's novella is a rambling piece of junk. Perhaps ten pages actually pertained to the plot of ""Billy Budd,"" while the rest of seventy pages were about useless thoughts, perceptions, and historical tie-ins that did not benefit from the story at all. The story was barely about the character of Billy Budd, and was more like a soapbox for the author. This is not worth the time. I do not recommend."
1,Horrible,This book is quite horrid. You have to be great at old language reading to even kind of understand what it's saying. I would never recommend this book.
4,Innocence and envy,"Billy Budd tells the story of an impressed sailor wrongfully accused of mutiny. I don't want to spoil what happens from there, but Melville examines themes of whether morality is a matter of intentions rather than consequences and whether the law can take this into account and fully serve justice, and whether innocence is enough to guarantee happiness in this life or whether hatred and envy can triumph over goodness. It's not as obscure as Moby Dick, though Melville does end it on that note, and while it doesn't have as much humor or grandeur (of a sort) as Moby Dick it fares pretty well in that regard considering its much shorter length. It's also not as polished, since it was an unfinished manuscript rather than a final draft, but I thought it was a powerful and well-told story, and on the whole I personally enjoyed it more than Moby Dick."
4,Classic Moral Story of the Sea,"Billy Budd is a difficult to read, but worthwhile moral story of the sea. The story is a tragedy where the part of each character is almost predestined. You have the wise and just sea captain, the cruel and evil ""jimmy leggs,"" and the innocent victim of fate, Billy. Some of the language is tough to get through but the author does a great job of telling the story in a way that pulls you in emotionally. Until the end, you know what is coming but you're still left on the edge of your seat. As another reviewer has pointed out, this story is based on a similar incident onboard the USS Somers that led to the founding of the Naval Academy."
5,"Superbly read by Simon Jones, beautifully abridged","A wonderful tale, on tape, worth listening to again and again. Melville at his finest. But why did it take so long to be published after his death."
3,"OK for certain uses, poor for others","You can scan in sheet music or import a midi file. That's cool. But editing after entry (even simple things like deleting measures at the end of the score) is not what this program was designed for.If you like the feature of clicking on a picture of a guitar fingerboard to get notes or tabs into a progam, this program has some utility.You should really try to work with a demo version first to see if this is what you wanted. I'm trying to arrange scores for jazz violin and guitar from generic midi files. G7 was not designed for that kind of use."
4,Better than I expected,"Being a teacher and bandleader, and new to computers, I needed an easy program to help me prepare lessons, and more importantly to make my originals readable on the job, usually in low light situations. Some of my tunes have twists and turns, and my handwriting isn't beautiful. My computer-savvy colleagues spoke highly of Sibelius and so I gave G7 a shot. It does the work I need simply, elegantly, and most importantly, I found it easy and fast to figure out. It certainly does a lot for the money, too. I'm very satisfied."
2,Okinawan Martial Arts History,This book has good writtings by some of the master's of Okinawan. I bought it thinking it was a continuation of Taira Sensei work (Espically since his photo is on the cover). This book is for those that are interested in all aspects of Okinawan history.
1,Reason and the Fundamentalist Attack on Science,"It occurs to me that the previous reviewer ignored the question of forensic science in criminal proceedings, where there is such a thing as an empirical basis for the matters under debate. However, I agree with his or her criticism of Johnson's work. The ""case against naturalism"" that is advanced here is an attack on empiricism and critical inquiry on the basis of renovated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist discourse. We are met with claims that normative propositions should not be subjected to critical empirical scrutiny or scientific evaluation, because what is may not be necessarily what ought to be. Fine, but as a social scientist, I require a higher standard of proof. While Johnson does argue his specific case well,I am not convinced that a return to a neo- scholastic worldview is anything more than highly bounded reason or logic based on skewed syllogisms and stacked heuristics."
5,"Clear, well thought-out arguments","While there are a few places where he treats the ""opposition"" fairly superficially, going into too much more detail would render the text unreadable. He is very careful to go for the core of the issues, though, and does a remarkable job at making sure that his reasoning is solid. You'd be a fool to only one side and not major authors on the other, but he greatly clarifies what the debate is really about. Excellent."
1,A lawyer's conception of truth,"Nobel laureate Kary Mullis was asked to testify as an expert witness at the O. J. Simpson trial (in the end, he didn't.) Consequently, he thought quite a lot about the nature of truth as it is seen by lawyers and by scientists. In law, the opposing sides approach a trial by collecting all the evidence that will be used in the trial, and exchanging it in discovery proceedings. At a certain point, the stream of evidence is cut off, and this finite body of information is used to reach an absolute, final verdict (truth-telling.) In science, to the contrary, the stream of evidence is never cut off, never ends, and no one ever reaches a final, absolute, unmodifiable truth. This distinction Johnson fails to understand (or at least chooses to gloss over.) He is committed to lawyer's truth and has no interest in scientific truth. That is the trouble with this book and, indeed, all of Johnson's pseudoscientific writings."
4,A Pleasant Potpourri of Pre-Baroque Pieces,"If your taste runs Bach and Before, this is the CD for you. The CD will also appeal to New Age/Celtic fans with its Medieval rhythms and instruments. Most of the songs reminded me of the better pieces on Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas trilogy. It may be a little exotic for listeners who prefer Mozart or Beethoven or other more traditional composers."
5,Excellent!!! Pure and simple. Great Filmmaker,"Thrilling, touching and very poetic.""A boy and a girl, high school teenagers, want to get away from the world and be alone for a while, so they hide in an abandoned factory on the outskirts. But there they fall in a trap of their own intention, and get stuck in the cargo elevator. There is no one around to hear them, and nobody knows their whereabouts. Tension arises after each failed attempt to escape, while they also have to deal with the fact that their entire universe is now reduced to a metal box smaller than a room."""
2,Dissappointed,This was just too slow of a game. I eneded up giving it away as it could not keep the interest of my guests at a party I used this at.
2,Not as fun as I thought.,"Thought it would be more challenging, but it's not. Very easy. And it repeated questions over and over. So it wasn't really worth the money, in my opinion. I'd pay $5 for it, but not more. Really disappointed. Fun for the first 10 minutes. After that it got old."
2,TOO MUCH REPEAT!,This game is fun the first time but beyond that not worth the price. The song list is short and you can go through it all in a hour or less.
1,Not worth the wait !!,"As I live in Africa sometimes we wait 3 months for things to arrive by boat.We thought that this would be a fun past time but after much anticapation we inserted the disc into the DVD and nothing happened, it wouldn't play and yes it was the right zone and the right system but it was just a dudA complete waste of money and timeA real disappointment"
3,Great TV except for two things,"This TV has a clear crisp picture and great sound quality. Good value for the money too! BUT, there is a 3-5 second delay waiting for channels to change. That may not sound like a lot of time but when you want to channel surf, it is a real pain. There is also no button on the remote for switching back to the last channel viewed. Had I know about these inconveniences, I would have purchased a different brand."
4,"Great Picture, Great Combo TV, Can't Channel Surf!","I love the picture this TV gives. Great deal for the money you pay. Unfortunately when you want to channel surf, it takes forever to change channels. I tried using the automatic channel programming mode, but it did not make channel surfing any faster. Overall I really like this TV for the fact that we mounted it on the wall and the dvd player is already connected. If you want a spacesaver at a good price this TV is definately worth it."
2,HDMI port unreliable,"Maybe it's just the one I got, but my HDMI port seems to be very unreliable. Most of the time it will be working fine, but once in a while for no reason, the screen goes black and stays black for an extended period of time. If I switch back to using component cables, it works immediately, but the picture with component cables always looks noticeably worse. I have tried connecting it to my cable box with 2 different HDMI cables, and connecting it to two different computers with a DVI to HDMI cable.The same thing happened each time, so I don't think it was the cable or the source of the HDMI input that had any problems.So basically I'm stuck watching it with component video, which does not look very good."
3,Just OK,"This is an OK TV. The picture is good. However the sound quality is terrible especially if you are watching a movie. And I hate it that there is no last button on the remote control to switch back and forth between channels, so annoying. It's a pretty thick TV so doesn't look very nice on the wall. Overall just an average TV."
5,No caveat emptor here!!!,"Its certainly evident that the ""Ph.D Chemist"" has never had hexagonal water before. If he had, especially on a consistent basis he would have to through his ignorance out the window.Any sharing of the information on structured water is a fantastic thing. Do some reading on the net about hexagonal water, especially on the Vitalizer Plus. If it interests you certainly get this book. We all need to know such vital information for our own health and the health of others."
3,Pretty Good but it sounds like it's time period,This Album takes on different vibes through out.the synth drums take over a bit much on this set.but you feel the Miles Vibe at different times.Miles is a Great Genius who Re-Invented himself over countless times.but the 80's wasn't his Golden time Period.still every now&then he would drop something on you that reminded you of His Innovative ways.this is worth checking into.
3,Well-produced Tribute to Miles,"An interesting and well-produced tribute to Miles by Danish composer and producer, Palle Mikkelborg, Aura attempts to represent Palle's vision of Miles' ""aura"" through the various colors of the spectrum. Each color is supposed represents a different emotion and a different side of Miles' personality. It's an interesting experiment, with Palle having written and produced all the material, but the end result is somewhat of a mixed bag. On the downside, while the various moods of the album are interesting, the album totally fails to produce any real emotion and comes across as cold and calculating. On the upside, the musicianship is very high, the production is great, and John McLaughlin rejoins with Miles on my personal favorite track, ""Orange."" There's a lot to recommend here, but don't expect any real innovation or the concentrated emotion of ""Sketches of Spain."""
3,fair effort,"I rarely give Miles less than 5 stars for his works, but it's difficult form me to give good marks to his early to mid 80's works. The music sounds lost at times, and Miles was not even close to 100% for many of those efforts.""Aura,"" while an interesting concept album, falls short in the tradition of groundbreaking Miles Davis recordings. Miles' playing is ok on these tracks, but not inspired, so far as I can judge. The inclusion of electronically synthesized drums, while commonplace today, I found to be very annoying and gets in the way of the overall feel of the work.Not essential for anyone except Miles fanatics or completists, ""Aura"" is one of Miles' most unrealized projects."
4,a taste of the first three Belew albums,"As the summary suggests this collection of tracks from Belew's first three solo albums offers an enjoyable view of his various pop and avant-pop stylings. Belew's maturation is right on this disk. You hear the effect working with the Talking Head's had in Belew's vocal delivery on many of the initial tracks, also there are some refreshing tracks that have a Zappaeque sense of humor and skilled performance. Most impressive are the selections culled from ""Desire Caught By The Tail."" The instrumental music brings components of his continuing stint with King Crimson. A pleasant collection of album tracks that desered more than the obscurity they met."
5,the only fault is that it doesn't include all of his work,"Adrians work, solo..with King crimson, Laurie Anderson, Frank Zappa..and many others, including a short teaching stint at the national guitar summer workshop..has been amazing..it would be nice if lone rhino and twang bar king were released in their entirety...."
3,Unusual music...,...I bought the CD because it contained a song I needed for a collection. I collected all the songs and music they played on the T.V. series Miami Vice. The songs they played on the show were great. So was the instrumental music on the show by Jan Hammer...
4,Adrian Belew solo(also was a member of King Crimson),"""Desire of the Rhino King"",a superb solo effort from Adrian Belew(King Crimson),maybe an acquired taste for the unfamiliar listener...but,for Belew fans, THIS IS THE ALBUM to own!This cd is the finest example of Belew's musical genius.Worth many listens!"
4,Outstanding work by 1 of the world's best guitar players,"Voted the best alternative guitarist for many years, Belew creates sounds with his guitar which are difficult to imagine. Building upon his work with Frank Zappa, King Crimson and The Bears, Adrian Belew has created a sonic masterpiece. Having a party? Put on Big Electric Cat, crank your system up and wake up your neighbors!"
5,An excellent song.,"I like a lot this Version, I have O-zone versions, but this version is much better!! I liked more Haiducii than O-zone, and this is not that Romania Hit, ""Dragostea din tei is excellent""; it's a pity you can not find the other single of Haiducii ""Mne Stoboy Horosho"" in this single you can see what is Haiducii, not just ""Dragostea Din Tei"", because Haiducii is excellent!!! I like Ozone too, but I prefer Haiducii!!!"
3,Good Little CD.........,"This CD has but one song remixed 4 or 5 times.............It's a cool cd, just dont over listen to it or you'll get sick of it.................Good song though....:)"
1,Trouth,"It isn't true what was written above. Not Haiducii put ""Dragostea din tei"" on the Top of the chart in Romania (and in whole Europe), but O-Zone. Haiducii it's only ""cover"". The real author of the music and lyric is Dan Balan from O-Zone. The original version is much better."
1,rubbish cover- buy the original... O-ZONE,"Haiducci covered this song illegally and claimed that it was originally theirs. the song is great but don¡t buy this version, like the other reviwer said, get o-zone's, it's the best."
1,Quite disappointed,"I got this for the karaoke version on track four. It is NOT what karaoke is suppsoed to be. There are no on-screen lyrics. They simply mixed the lead vocals down, and you can still hear them in the background. Unless you know the words to this song, you'll have a hard time doing it for karaoke.I was not impressed with the Haiducii version of this song (track 1), or the mixes on tracks 2 and 3. I have heard better. I prefer the O-Zone version of this song. They were the first to record it, although Haiducii released it in Italy first. There is a lot of contention over this song. It has become more well-known, thanks to the lip-synching video by Gary Brolsma, which you can find just about anywhere on the net. For those doing a search, he is not Greek, he is from Jersey.It's a catchy tune, and fun to listen to and sing, but as I sated, in my opinion, you should save your money for the O-Zone version."
1,won;t last 5 minutes of use,"got it out of the case, filled it up and my 5 years old started to have fun with it, but only lasted 5 minutes, it wouldn;t work anymore. Worst quality toy ever. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY."
4,grrrrrrreat!!!,"This is one of the best ecclectic cd's in my collection. The horn section is really good, I especially like the tenorsaxophone..."
5,very pleased,I am very very happy with my purchase of these sweatshirts. Great Quality and recieved my order promptly
3,New Slant on SF,"This author is as far removed from Heinlein as RAH was from Jules Verne. Meluch's staccato delivery shoots ideas at the reader: a caste-based society, unique mode of FTL travel, genocide, graphic prisoner torture and truth tellers. I would have awarded another star, but you have to stop and re-read initial chapters to integrate later revelations.But stick with it, and you will be pulled into a tale of politicians plotting, ancient entities dictating, native uprisings, innocents dying and pilot derring-do. I know, in jumping from character to character, the viewpoint twists can be disturbing, but I put this book down with vague regrets. How did the Second Cassiopeian Empire start (Re-read p.5)? Did New Earth learn from its mistakes or make a mess of peace too? What happened to Paul Strand next?"
5,Fascinating,"Incredible. Rich and nuanced, combining a fascinating social structure between mortals and immortals with an intricately human display of the consequences therein. My favorite Meluch novel."
3,my book,I have read your editorial and I am very much happy to read that.I thought that this book must be good one.
3,A Little Disappointing...,"I'm a huge Ella fan, but not much is available about her personal life. This is a decent book if you want to know more about Ella's career; in that respect, it's pretty exhaustive and very detailed. I was a little disappointed in the overall quality of the book, however. It has a cheap feel to it, the paper is shoddy, the pictures look as though they were run through a copier, and there are many, many typos and punctuation errors. I also wasn't crazy about the writing style. But for you die-hard Ella fans, I would suggest that you read the book and get what you can out of it."
3,Geoffrey Mark Fidelman LOVES Ella,"Ella Fitzgerald is my favorite singer. I think that her best work is outstanding. I wish that this book was too. This is an okay biography of Ella's life and career. The author is clearly a fan and has some trouble being objective about some of Ella's work (especially her later work in which she had clearly lost a lot of her voice due to illnesses); however, the book gives you a detailed overview of Ella's numerous appearances on television, her performances with Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong, and her extensive recordings.There is another book about Ella by Stuart Nicholson that you may want to read too. It is rather dry in comparison to this book, but I found that by blending Mr. Fidelman's almost-giddy prose with Nicholson's workman-like style, I did come away with a feeling for the woman who Ella was."
3,Not as bad as reviewed,The reviews are a little unfair. This is accurate and written with passion. The tone has clearly offended. However I do believe that the definitive biography has yet to be written. I hope somebody is putting it together as I write; maybe Will Friedwald or David Ritz will do it.
4,"Nice cassette recorder, clear voice","This cassette recorder is good with Sony's clear voice recording. The speakers are OK except when you turn it pass ""4"" on the volume dial, you can feel the the speakers' vibration."
3,fair,The adaptor was wrong for this cassette recorder...Amazon needs to add the right adaptor number that works with this recorder..
5,Wonderful!,"I love this cassette recorder. I never record on it - only listen to recorded books, and it's perfect for that. The sound is excellent, battery life is good, and it has switch to change the tape direction. Wish I'd bought three."
1,"Waste of Time, Waste of Money, Waste of Paper","The documentation for Visual Cafe leaves so many questions unanswered. This book was no help whatsoever! It could be useful to newbees learning java, but if you want deeper understanding of the application DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,great for small groups.,These are great for a small pull-out class. There is just enough room for primary age students to spell one or two words or solve a simple math problem.
3,"A convincing talent, not fully convincingly presented","Some of the cuts on this CD are all-time classics, innovative, catchy and demonstrative of real writing and playing talent. Others are likely to be appealing to Buddy Miles fans more than others. And still others suggest that this ""best of"" compilation, like too many others, doesn't fully skim the cream. If you want to own 1 sampler of Buddy Miles's work, this CD may be as good as any. Otherwise, dig further into his archives."
4,Many Miles to Buddy Miles,"Buddy Miles is truly one the unsung heros of my generation. Whether he's playing by himself or featured with Santana, Malo or Hendrix, he is one of the greatest drummers in the business. I have been blessed to actually attend one of his shows and his band was tight! He sounded exactly like his recordings. I have loved him always. I miss his music so much. No one can do ""Down By The River"" the way he did. He had a technique unmatched by no one in the business. I have fond memories of myself, doing the funky chicken and the penguine on the dance floor. I strongly suggest that you purchase this album and try to sit down and listen to it all. I bet you will be out of your seat before he's done! I danced many miles when Buddy was on the stereo."
4,Buddy Miles Live,"One of my favorite albums of all time and probably one of the best live R&B alums ever is the ""Buddy Miles Live"" released originally as a two vinyl set. I literally wore the album out many years ago. I think others did too because later I was trying to find a copy to tape and every copy I found was in bad shape. It is really incredible to me that this album has never been released on CD. That horn section blew me away. I am thankful at least for the songs they put on this compilation. Sounds like there is hope."
4,highly recommended,"great compilation from a soulful, dynamic, master of the stage. yeah, we all know that he played with jimi hendrix in the b.o.g., but he is such a great artist in his own respects. who can get more soulful than his vocal on ""down by the river"", and his great interpretations of such allman bros. classics as ""dreams"", and ""midnight rider"" not to mention his own classics as ""them changes"", ""texas"", and ""joe tex"". to my knowledge, the original buddy miles express albums are not available on cd. this is a great overview of those albums. check it out!"
4,Buddy Miles.,"I remembered, 'Down by the River,' 'Them Changes,' and, 'We've got to live together.' Just read on CNN that Buddy Miles died."
4,RIP Buddy,"I do not know where to begin as I didn't know what to expect from the whole CD. I bought it for ""Changes"" because I love the way it gets peoples attention. What I didn't expect was the way he did ""Down by the River."" OMG!!! Nobody does it like him. God Bless Him."
2,Not as impressing as her other works,"I love all of Gene Stratton-Porter's works. They are all wonderfull. The first story I read of hers was A Girl of the Limberlost. Since then I have had very high standards for her books. I read this book with those standards in mind. I must say that it didn't have the same quality that I found in other books. I do not wish to put anyone off buying this book, because none of her books aren't worth the time to read. If you do wish to get to know Mrs. Stratton-Porter's writtings I sugest you do so with a different book."
2,Song of the Cardinal,This is a copy of the original since the copyright has expired. It didn't hold my family's interest very well.
4,The Song of the Cardinal,I was so surprised to get this book and find that it really is a story all about a cardinal.I have read other books by Gene Stratton Porter and loved them. I think I would have known this book was written by her even if I did not know when I started the book.The describtive phrases are so good and so realistic. She must have observed cardinals for a very long time to be able to write this.Very Good!PK Nica
4,Sweet story,"This was my first time reading a Gene Porter Stratton book. A friend loaned it to me. I thought the story was sweet, well written and the pictures wonderful. I would love to visit her home site some day. And I have ordered more of her books as well as a copy of ""The Song of a Cardinal"" for my mother, who is an avid bird watcher!"
5,One of the best books on my shelf!,"What can I say? I have never been dissapointed by anything Douglas Wilson has written and this book is no exception! This is a very Biblically sound, balanced book and presents the Christian family life so beautifully that it truly gives glory to God! Many of us did not have the benefit of growing up in a Christian home, and if you are struggling to have a family that glorifies God then this is the book for you! If you are unsure about purchasing this book ~ don't be! You will not regret the investment. The blessings that you will recieve from reading this and applying it will far outweigh the cost!"
4,"Great third book in the ""Warlord"" series","""The Warlord"" is the best of the three books about the Remmington family; however, ""The Scoundrel"" has its own charming, witty dialogue and characters. The main character, the Duke, is the descendent of the two main characters in ""Warlord"". The Duke follows his ancestress, Tess, in possessing a physical fidget that reveals he is lying. Tess twists her hair when she lies, but I could not find out [from the book] what he does. This book is a good read, and certainly worth your time!"
3,Misnamed,"The main character wasn't a scoundrel. He was a sort of stuffy British duke who had difficulty expressing his feelings.The heroine was pretty good. She cried a lot, but she had a good reason. She got attacked a lot. The good thing about her was she was intelligent, but she played dumb in public.The villain was not revealed until the very end, and it was sort of disappointing. I would have liked a little more insight into his character.Overall, a slightly better than average romance."
2,"ok, but I handed it in at the used book store quickly",I enjoyed Warlord and have re-read it and her other book about the Warlord's brother several times. This was disappointing.
2,"a sterile, clinical presentation, indeed","Published in 1988, this is fundamentally a textbook-like tome with little direct application to the daily joys and trials of marriage and family life. It is well footnoted and indexed, though marriage and divorce are fundamentally seen as ""choices"" and there are no index entries for ""vows,"" ""commitment,"" or ""fun.""There is no heart to this book and no information useful for the establishment of a healthy marriage and no information for correction in times of difficulty. (It may never have occurred to the authors that married folks have far more sex than the unmarried.) All in all, quite sterile--somewhere between an anatomy/physiology text and veterinarian studies."
2,Book arrived late,"I paid for expedited shipping and the book did not arrive on time as promised. The condition was good, but be prepared to wait on your order."
2,Not nearly as interesting as one would think,"The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex."
4,"Good beats, interesting lyrics.","My favourite song on this CD is Gold Dust; the first song I ever heard by Hol'fader. It's got some really good beats, and some smooth, feeling tunes to it. The lyrics are interesting, the tunes catchy. I liked this CD."
2,not very useful and redundant,"As a practitioner, I did not find this book very useful. All the author did was copy and paste a bunch of cases into one book and organize them into specific categories, cases that can be found on your own in many free and on-line databases. It might be a good reference for faculty (or friends/colleagues of the author who will require graduate students to read it), but its practical value is minimal. If you must have this book, as an alternative I suggest printing off the table of contents and index and then use them as a guide for printing off cases on-line when you need them.If you do encounter legal issues on a regular basis, I strongly recommend Kaplin and Lee's Law of Higher Education book as a method for giving you the background you need and its use as a reference."
4,Grey,"""Assisted Living"" is a grey film--a film without definition, without the comfort of a border between black and white. First, it's a fictionalized documentary, and that shading is important to the meaning the film has for us. Watching it, we'd like some resolution, some plot, some gripping and overwhelming message. But there is none of this. The film slides between a mother's passion and and senile boredom, between love's tragedy and a human comedy, between a drugged haze and a clear reality, and between the hard facts of old age care and the casual fiction of a screen play. And throughout it all are the hands--old, gnarled, veined, like dark birds.""Assisted Living"" is a beautiful film. It's not easy to watch, and it isn't meant to be. It casts an ominous shadow which hangsover the heart long after the film ends."
1,bad,"The write up I read on this movie made it sound so funny, it was not only stupid it was very sad."
2,Disappointing,A janitor works in a assistant care living center and amuses himself with harmless phone calls that perhaps makes the old people happy. Or at least it seems nobody is getting hurt. He develops compassion for an old woman who knows Alzheimer's is taking her mind. He tries to placate her with a fake call from her son but it makes things worse.I failed to see the comedy in this movie. I thought the technique of shooting in a real care center interesting and gave the film a feel of authenticity. The part fiction/part docudrama was poorly executed and just didn't mesh well. I was glad it was only 72 minutes. It was getting long at 50 minutes.
4,Early Paul Revere and the Raiders,"This CD is perky, with the Raiders putting their own spin on the British invasion. ""Just Like Me,"" in particular, echoes the Kinks' ""You Really Got Me"" without being a direct imitation. This entire collection is pre-1967."
1,I received broken Murchandise...,"I purahsed the airsoft pistol and it did not work. After unsuccessfully trying to get it to function for about 1 hour, I called the vendor. They said they would credit me for the cost. This was about 7 weeks ago. I still have not received my credit to my credit card account. So I am very dissatisfied."
1,Big Gigantic Cups,The Chantelle Bra was incorrectly sized! The Bra was supposed to be a DDDD but instead I was sold an H or a Z cup? Anyway the cup size on the bra was completely wrong and immensely huge! One of my boobs was pointing east and the other to the west! I don't know about you but I like my tiots in the middle. Do not buy a bra from this seller it will end in great dissapointment and a total and complete ripoff!
5,Chantelle - A Touch of Class!,"I love Chantelle lingerie and the Amazone bra is one of the best bras I have EVER owned. This chic, beautiful bra came in black or white. Darn shame you can no longer get the black one. After all, black bras are beautiful and if you are getting a Chantelle bra, you are getting the Lexus of lingerie!The Amazone bra is very comfortable and offers excellent support. With the proper care, Chantelle products will last you a lifetime. Handwash them and let them dry naturally. NEVER, repeat, NEVER put any bra in the drier! You might want to use lingerie soap and a lingerie net in a gentle wash cycle if you choose to wash your lingerie in the machine. Chantelle, a long established company known for their high end, high caliber lingerie does indeed make outstanding lingerie. Any Chantelle product is an investment. You will certainly get your money's worth out of any Chantelle product you buy. I have this bra and love it!"
1,Very displeased,This product was shipped to me in an unpadded envelope and when it arrived the CD disc was broken in two. It was unable to be played.
5,Platters,"There used to be a saying that something that was right on target was ""A full_______""(for example, 'Cleveland' - which in those days some people did not mean to be complimentary!), well, this is a ""full"" Platters - a perfect Platters cut with all the great songs."
4,Another good OS,"I upgraded my mini to Tiger and haven't finished learning the new features. The dashboard is nice, and more useful than I expected.I'm a little disappointed that the upgrade seems to have broken my file sharing with the Windows systems in our home. That is, I cannot connect to shares that are on the Windows systems. These shares did work before the upgrade. I'll fix this when I get a chance; I don't need to share files that often with the Windows systems anyway.I was happy with 10.3, and I'm happy with 10.4. I expect this stuff to work and it does!"
2,Apple Mac OS X upgrade,"Udgraded from 10.2.4 to 1o.4.6. Cannot see all the benefits yet. Needed to upgrade to run selected sofware i.e. google earth, but lost my wireless connection. After spending almost 15 hours over the phone with Apple I was never able to reestablish the connection."
4,Mac OS X Tiger - Pretty Good,"First off, I gave it 4 stars because for windows users- 5 star product, but for mac users- 3 starswindows users- if you're still using windows, you are missing out on no more troubleshooting problems, great user interface and next gen features like spotlight, dashboard and of course the great iLife. Tiger is about two times better than vista ultimate, and combining that with the expensive price, tiger is 8 times better. Even though vista copies many of the features in tiger, they are far from being as productive and easy-to-use as tiger's (not to mention tons of bugs and problems). SO GET A MAC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!![...]"
1,overpriced,"Built on top of free unix technology, add that to overpriced software bundles and limiting compliance to vendor supplied hardware and you've got a real winner.Ubuntu 7.04 PC Editionis basically the same technology under the hood and is going to save you some green."
4,Cute but no arch support,"Very cute shoes... I got a lot of compliments on these, but they have absolutely no arch support. I put in gel inserts, but that made the shoe a little tight. They fit true to size and are probably best for people who don't really walk around that much."
5,Into the Rabbit Hole,"Brautigan's excellent novel is definately worth the quick read, and then worth a second read to catch all his language play. Having grown up near Big Sur, this book was particularly funny as I believe Lee Mellon is still in residence there.Brautigan's description of drugs, drinks, frogs and the commas of Ecclesiastes are all done in a straight forward style that made me laugh out loud.One of my favorite paragraphs: ""He broke the seal on the bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured a big slug of whiskey into his mouth. He swallowed it down with a hairy gulp. Strange, for as I said before: he was bald."" A great read."
5,Classic humor,"I first read this novel forty years ago while working as a poll watcher in New Jersey. I forget what party I was supposedly ""watching"" for, but my dad and I were the only ones in town. During the long, boring day I read ""Confederate General"" and laughed so hard at different times that I cried, and snot dripped down my face. I am sure the other party's watchers are still convinced that Democrats are mental.As someone who now lives near Big Sur, the author beautifully captures the spirit of the place. The humor is timeless....after 40 years, little has changed. Well, mega-mansions, LA tourists....but the heart and soul are the same."
4,Working my way through all the Agatha Christies,"I'm usually surprised by ""who don' it"", and this was no exception. I recommend it to any Agatha Christie fan."
4,Excellent recap of continual missteps,"Chandrasekaran's writing and reporting are top-notch within this volume, a book which goes a long way in explaining the problems encountered during the reconstruction of Iraq. The author is even-handed in his accounting, not necessarily pointing the finger at anyone, but certainly pulling no punches. If there is one person who should be closely scrutinized, it would be the combat-boot-wearing, Armani-suited Paul Bremer, whose ego, hubris, and unquestioning decision-making could allow for no suggestions by State Department officials or native Iraqis. His decision upon arriving in Iraq to ""deBaathify"" leadership positions and to dismantle the Iraqi army shall go down as horrible mistakes. But those are just the most dramatic mistakes in a long list of errors committed by the provisional authority. This account succeeds on several fronts: good sources, honest quotes, and non-judgmental imparting of facts."
5,Imperial Life in Emeral City,Excellant review of the mistakes we made in Iraq. Someone should be jailed for the ineptitude of the people we sent over to do the job.
5,Imperial life of the Bush drones,"Good read, shows that you get what you pay for. A few chapters should be included in History books in the future."
4,Another in the sad tellings of yet another American mistake...,"It seems that, for a good people, we sure seem to elect a lot of leaders of questionable judgement. You hear a lot of folks say that ""history will be the true judge"" of the Iraqi debacle. I say, that's a lot of doodly-squat. Did we need time to pass before knowing that Viet Nam was a disastrous engagement? Viet Nam has turned out ok despite, or perhaps more correctly stated delayed by, our misadventure.The story of the Green Zone is yet another indication that we've once again gotten involved in something that wasn't a threat to us. Afghanistan was, and we all knew it, and now we're in the process of screwing that up because of taking our eye off the ball, and focusing on Iraq instead.Anyway, very good read. Probably one of the best, although like the others discouraging, views on the war."
4,"Enlightening, Entertaining, and Dispiriting","I found this book a very interesting and entertaining read. As a look inside the CPA and the life of civilians in the green zone it is without par amoungst the many post-invasion books. It is also a comprehensive indictment of the ideologues in Defense shooting themselves in the foot with example after example of the marginalization and exclusion of anyone with experience in Arab cultures or occcupations in years past. It also details the proper ""mindset"" was a continuing requirement even when faced with a situation that contradicted the party line. Accomodating reality in Iraq, even acknowledging reality in Iraq, was considered disloyalty.The most depressing thing about this book is not the fault of the author but the ongoing real situation in Iraq and the deepseated feeling that is impossible to shake--that none of these lessons have been learned by the people in charge, and variations of all these problems are being repeated by policy makers even today."
3,How not to run a soap factory.,"Inside the Green Zone, Baghdad, lived a collection of United States of America political hacks and grossly incompentent young people. A collection never before seen in one zoo. The zoo keeper thought he was the Emperor of Iraq. A well written book that is worth reading if you have the time."
3,Don't base this book by it's cover,"I saw the movie, and wanted to have more details about what was going on. I thought this book would have more detail, it did, but it didn't have anything in the movie. It shows Matt Damon on cover but it's all political nothing with the movie, no Damon character, no Delta force, not the movie at all. The book is very interesting, but feel ripped off that they didn't clarify what it was about and then used the movies picture to sell it."
3,Timely information,"""Imperial Life"" is honest, first hand, information. The author has a good grasp of the subject, of the surroundings and above all, of reality. He is able to pick up the essentials and deal with them without exaggerating his importance or his role. He is a well informed man, as he should be. The book is very well put together, and a pleasure to read. It is above all, timely. This means, regretably, that its importance shall pass, as the events he decribe will give in time place to ""new improved"" versions. The importance for historians to come and to serious readers will not be diminished."
4,Pretty close to the truth...sorry to say,"I was working at the CPA during the time the author covers in his book. I think I may have been at some of the meetings he describes. He captures the sense of the CPA, a bunch of well-intentioned, hard-working people without much of a clue about how to run an occupation in an Arab country. These were heady times and we believed we were birthing a new democracy. Few of us were equipped to pull it off and the split between DoD and the rest of the US and coalition governments doomed us from the start."
4,Emperial Life in the Emerald City,Found it to be well written and enjoyed the honesty with which the author wrote.
4,a group not all are gaming the Best Government Money Can Buy,A refreshing reflection on how a group not all are gaming the Best Government Money Can Buy for there own parochial benefits. At the cost of our Finest and Treasury. Bringing out those who got use in to this sad game. And those trying to turn on the light of day. Book after Book & day after day makes one ask win will these dangerous clown's be forced to suit up and face a Court of law?Ronald Douglas Kennedy
2,too many large nuts,"I read the description and thought this might be a good supplement of seed for my bird which eats mainly fruits/vegetables and a supplement. I dont recommend anyone feed a Macaw only this food, they need more nutrients than this can supply.If you like unshelled peanuts, almonds and walnuts, and you want that to be half the food, you may be happy. However, after removing this, there is mainly sunflowers, pumpkin seeds and safflower along with a small amount of dried fruit, that my bird eats with quite a bit of additional smaller seeds a macaw ignores. To make the best use of this food, we removed the large seeds and use these a treats and rewards and with the other leftover half, we give a small amount sprinkled over the fruits."
4,"The Find, Treasure Hunting and Passion in the Palm Beaches","I liked the book. It had adventure, suspense, and romance. I found the story to be very detailed. The characters were enjoyable. I liked the inventive way they went about finding the treasure."
4,Some great tunes...and some not so good tunes.,"There's a Chick Corea song called ""Song to the Pharoah Kings"" which is worth the price of this album alone - clocking in at over 8 minutes. Some stellar playing by everyone on this album. A few duds, but the songs that shine - shine so bright that you'll forget about the duds... Highly recommended..."
3,DAZZ HAS BEEN SHORT-CHANGED AGAIN!,"Great band, good CD, but if you saw the reviews of ""Best Of Brick"", most people were highly disappointed that the version of ""Dazz"" that was included was the shortened single version. When I saw they released another greatest hits compilation, I assumed it was to correct this and add ""Sweat Till You Get Wet"". They didn't have track lengths marked on outside, but I bought it anyhow. At under 45 minutes, it wasn't for lack of space on the CD. Maybe better luck on the next Greatest Hits!"
4,Good Set,"Brick still hasn't gotten that fair Greatest Hits Package but this one is Nice.""Sweat til you Get Wet"" the Jam that Ray Parker JR.Produced on them is here&is still Banging.Brick was a tight Funky Band back in the day.""Dazz""&""Push,Push"" were the Joints."
5,Very Good,"I'm using this on a 2 Meter ham radio repeater, with a common antenna/duplexer, which is about the roughest service you can put a receiver preamp through. Its been running for 6 months now and it improves receiver sensitivity by at least 10 dB, definitely doubling the range of the repeater. Had tried another preamp with a GaASFET in it, but it was too sensitive for repeater service."
3,OK but not durable,"This case works well and provides much needed touch screen protection. However, the knob that the belt clip attaches to is flimsy and breaks easily. Mine broke after just 3 months and I had to buy another leather case. The phone is great but the accessory selection is very weak. Kyocera needs to provide a better case that can hold up to routine use on a belt clip."
1,Doesn't Stand Up To Short-Term Use,"As others have put it, this ""case"" does have some limitations, among them being that it doesn't provide any protection for the screen or buttons. Of course, on the plus side, it provides easier access to those items. One of the major annoyances, however, as pointed out in some other reviews, is that you can't place the phone in the sync cradle while the phone is in this case - and it is not an easy operation to remove the phone from the case. What is more troubling, however, is that only four days of (not very hard) use, the bottom part of the case, which is (of course) necessary to keep the phone in the case, has started to slip badly, and it appears that this will render the case unusable after a very short time."
1,Kyocera leather case,"I copied another review...the leather case I received is in now the case described in the picture...it wastes my time to send this back. Not happy...The picture and description do not match this item. The item you receive is pictured under ASIN B0005B20H. I've written to customer service but so far no change. The item you receive is open-faced, there is no protection for the keypad or touch screen. I'm sending mine back. I wanted the ""pouch"" leather case as shown in the picture."
4,An enjoyable read,"As a first novel, I thought da bushes was very polished leaving no loose ends. The author's relaxed style of writing is compelling and smooth. There are short chapters with an even pace. Each scene flows effortlessly into the next.The main character, Harry, is well-developed with smart dialogue fitting a New York private investigator. There are just enough characters and suspects to keep the reader interested.It was a quick read that I enjoyed. I'm looking forward to the next adventure!"
1,Sadness Prevails,"I stopped collecting the series many years ago when I hit a wall with the genre but not the desire for aural essences of ""La Isla Blanca."" So I bit the bullet and purchased 11>15. I'm somewhat anxious about opening the remaining CDs since the ""luster and shine"" of the seminal series created by Padilla, Bruno just isn't there. Fortunately, I've 30 days from date of purchase to return the lot to Amazon. Not an auspicious start! Very sad!"
5,Trumpet Lovers,"Maybe becasue I played the trumpet when I was a teen that I have been drawn to the greats like Armstrong,Clifford Brown, Lee Morgan, Chet Baker, Miles and Wynton Marsalis. Maybe it's the sugar that flows from that $50,000 Monette custom horn that Wynton plays. Whatever it is, this is a beauty of a CD. There is nothing that you cannot like about this. This, like some of his brother Branford's recordings and other great new artists, gives us hope and joy that there is great Jazz again being made. This deserves to be placed alongside Miles, Trane, Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, Bird and the amazing Clifford Brown. It's great that we can enjoy these talented new artists for their craft along with the latest in recording technology which was not available in decades past."
4,American French Magic,Will the real Wynton Marsalis please stand up please stand upthe Marciac Suite is some of the best work that the Wynton Marsalis Septet has done in ages. There are none of the political asides or the heavy handed musicianship that has plagued his last releases. There is a joy and spirit that fills these tracks. The American Gallic flavor makes for a tasty gumbo. Recommended for all lovers of traditional jazz.
4,Seine for Kids in the Creek,Purchased for local schools to conduct water quality activities in area waters. I just added 2x2 handles and it is ready to use. I am very pleased with the quality of the seine for the money.
5,Excellent cover for small ponds,This works really well for keeping the fall leaves out of a 4 X 6' pond. I staked down the 4 corners using the ties. The quality is very good. You can steak it down more around the edges if you have problems with raccoons hopping on it at night to get a drink!
3,"Soft table tennis set, not for large tables.","This table tennis set is well made and easy to put together. The paddles are sturdy but soft. Playing a game with this set is not really like playing actual table tennis, however. You need to be very close to the other player, as the soft table tennis balls do not bounce much at all. If you are familiar with regular table tennis, you will need to adjust your playing style for this soft version. This may work well on a very short table, but it does not work well on a typical dining room size table.The plus is that since the balls do not bounce like real table tennis balls, you won't be chasing them all over the room. I can see this working well for children without the fine motor skills required to play regular table tennis."
3,"Great net, not so great ball and paddles","I would buy this net again however the balls do not bounce and the paddles do not work the way I would expect for table tennis. We went out and purchased ping pong paddles and standard ping pong balls and are now enjoying the net. The net is nice; good quality, stable, easy to set up."
3,Great if you don't have room for full size,"This is a great setup if you don't have room for the real thing. I found the plastic couplings for the net hard to assemble, but it stays once you get them together. We replaced the foam balls with real ping pong balls and it works great. Good option for a 6 yr old who's learning to play."
4,"Perfect ping pong, when you don't want to ruin furniture.","Yes, as the other reviewers noted, the paddles and balls are made out of foam. What this means is that it takes a little bit of getting used to as you have to hit a bit harder than in traditional ping pong. That being said, this is the perfect set to use on a conference room or dining room table as it can't possibly ruin the furniture in any way. And after the 20 minute learning curve, it's almost as fun as regular ping pong."
4,I'm looking for a track...,uhmmm... do anyone of u guys know if the dance after the cheer BRR... is here in the soundtrack??!
2,Missing song information,"In case anyone else is looking for it, the song that's playing during the stolen cheer (the one that begins with ""Brr, it's cold in here"") is The 900 # by The 45 King. It's too bad they left it off the soundtrack!"
4,Not bad considering lack of some of the songs in movie,"Ok this is a very decent cd with lots of great songs from the movie, the only problem i had with it was one of my favorite songs from the movie was the song that was on the tape that the brother gave to the main girl. That sounded like an alternative song and made her dance like crazy on the bed. I don't know why they left that song out of the soundtrack. Also they left out ""happy boy and happy girl"" by aqua."
2,An example of mainstream music.,"The movie ""Bring It On"" is likeable and peppy because it is quite unlike most other teenage movies. The soundtrack, however, trades originality for mainstream, playing only the songs they think people want to hear. Most of the songs from the competitions are missing, as well as some of the songs from the trailer. The movie is terrific, but the soundtrack is basically a letdown."
1,missing all rocxk songs,"where are all the rock songs? i need to know sum from sum 41 and mest, and any others thanks if someone could or would respond."
3,Good but........,the soundtrack was really good but i wish they had included the song that Cliff gave to Torrance. That song was sooo cool!
5,Bring It On,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,its okay...,"the songs themselves are okay, but they dont capture the spirit of the movie. make sure you listen to the clips so you're not disappointed! and read the other reviews, so you can find the songs you're actually looking for. does anybody know the song they play when the go to either regionals or nationals, when missy's looking around at the other teams? it goes something like: "".... there she goes, slipping and sliding...."""
2,This CD is Missing Something,"While this CD does have good songs like ""As If"" and ""Mickey"", it is DEFINITLY missing something. Where is the oh so wonderful ""You're Just What I Need"" song? You know, the one that Torrance get's from Missy's brother. Now why did they leave it out? I don't know. I want to find someway to get it, or write to the company or something, but I don't know what to do. If you can do anything to get it or tell them to put it on the CD, DO!"
3,Found the missing song!!,"For anyone that bought the ""Bring it On Soundtrack"" and was dissapionted there wasn't the song from the trailer on it. You know, the one that goes ""Boom! check out the girls with the butts!"" Well the song you are looking for is ""Booty Bounce"" by kinsu. Hope I helped you."
3,"Neat Little Movie, Good Little Soundtrack","My daughter and I went to see the movie yesterday and we enjoyed it very much. It is sort of a cross between Clueless and those old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland where the kids decide to put on a show. We liked the movie so much, in fact, we bought the soundtrack on the way home.As soundtrack albums go, this is fine. Our favorite track so far is Bewitched's remake of Mickey.As usual for soundtracks, there are at least a couple of songs we heard in the movie that do not seem to be here, but what's here is lots of beaty, bouncy fun. Give us a cheer!"
4,goody good good,"this cd is not perfect.. for that matter, what is?! anyways, this cd has excellent songs... unfortunately (like some other reviewers have mentioned) they are missing some songs that were in the movie. otherwise, this deserves 5 stars but the lack of songs pulls it down to 4. all of the song relate to the movie and i surely recommend it :)"
3,sort of disapointed,"I really like some of the songs on the soundtrack, (Micky by B*witched, and Freakin' You by The Jungle Brothers) but what was the deal with leaving out some of the best songs of the movie! I was really disapointed to see that Just what I Need by Rufus King and There she Goes by the Getaway People were not on there."
3,"Bring it on, the SOUNDTRAACK","Ok First of all I was unsure about buying this CD because you couldn't listen to any of the songs while being on the internet, so I decided to take a chance and bought it, but as some of the other reviewers I noticed they were missing a couple of the songs that actually took place in the movie, but I am the HIP HOP and R+B type of person so all in all I ended up thinking that this was a pretty good CD because they did include one of my faves from the movie which was ""Mickey"". Which is a great song that brings back memories of funny parts at the end of the movie."
4,Good cd.,"I loved the movie ""Bring it on"",so when I found out there was a soundtrack I was naturally compelled to buy it.And I am so glad that I did.There are only two songs on this cd that I don't like. The first song I don't like is by Blaque,titled ""As if"".The other song I can't stand is by two dorky little girls named Daphne and Celeste titled ""U.G.L.Y."",that song is so dorky,I can't stand it!My favorite song is by Atomic Kitten titled ""See Ya"".Then my second favorite song is by P.Y.T.,""Anywhere USA"",it's a tight song.""Bring it on""(soundtrack) is a good cd that deserves to be in everyone's cd collection.Enjoy!"
3,Item description does not match,"This item does NOT INCLUDE the following items/features:*TV stations and weather channels*Dynamic, over-ear headphones*Carrying caseIt came in a very small box without a small hand strap and a flimsy pair of in-ear headphones. No TV/Weather feature. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED.And yes, the model number is the same: WM-FX495.Pros:*The unit does play tapes well.Cons:*Missing features that are promised (Weather/TV, case, over-ear headphones)*The radio reception is not that great.*It has that silver paint that tends to rub on on Sony products.*The interface is really awkward. I can see they were trying to get the big buttons off the side and onto a little configuration on the front. The only problem is hitting tiny buttons is not user friendly. The menu isn't laid out well and it's very easy to hit the buttons when you move around.*Did I mention no belt clip?If you want a nice tape player with auto reverse (no Dolby!) this is a good unit for you. Don't expect anything else."
5,Great bang for the buck!,"I purchased this model solely on the strength of the review I saw listed. I too had purchased the sports walkman FS222. Two hours later I returned it, thoroughly distraught and wondering where to find a suitable replacement for my five year old sony sports walkman. I only use my walkman in the gym, so a cd player, or the clunky buttons and lack of a belt clip on most of sony's models wouldn't work for me. I had almost decided to go with an ipod when I checked amazon for options... and there it was! the answer to all my problems. This walkman is light, easily programmable; features a weather band & TV settings AND.. comes with a carrying case & belt clip. I really couldn't ask for more....except to ask some major retailers to stock this model since I might have to buy a spare for the day this one gives out!"
2,Disappointed,"I have now tested all of the Sony Walkmans featuring tape / radio that are found at Best Buy and Amazon. I thought this product would finally be the best combination and was happy with the unit, until I discovered that the FM radio has such poor reception! I liked the remote which has the preset radio stations and you could play the tapes easily from it. The belt attachment fit nicely on the belt buckle and the tapes sounded great. I can hear AM radio, but the FM reception is just terrible, so this essentially becomes just a tape player and is not what I wanted. Still searching for the ultimate tape / radio combination that I can exercise with..."
5,Jogger from NM,"Very very nice piece of equipment. Practical and functional, extremely lightweight, the sound quality can't be better."
3,EXPECTED MORE FROM SONY,POSITIVE SIDES:1. Quality of sound is OK. Need to test more.NEGATIVE SIDE:1. Cassette door has a sliding lock. It is difficult to slide and open the cassette door. POOR DESIGN2. The controls are confussing. NOT USER FRIENDLY.3. The volume control is difficult in the inline remote. The KNOB IS NOT ACCESSABLE.
1,Was not sent this product,I opened the package up to find some fruit crusher. Was not worth the time and energy to get fixed. Ordered direct from Tassimo so I could be assured to get the correct item.
5,Terrific,Another one of my personal favorites.Along with The Stooge and Cinderfella.I love it when Dean sings That's Amore.But my favorite part is when Jerry's in the store on roller skates with all the dishes and stuff on the shelves!you just know it will all end up on the floor somehow.Hilarious!!
4,The Caddy,I really enjoyed watching movies from my youth. Compared to the movies they are showing now days we need more of the older movies. It's good to be able to watch a movie and have good humor and not sick humor. I am glad that Amazon give us that pleasure again by bring back old movies such as Caddy shack to watch and enjoy. The material I received was in good condition and I was able to watch the movie clearly.Thanks Amazon. I liked when Amazon tell you the condition of the movie and give you fair prices.
3,Average.,"This book could have been much better. The target of the book is the beginner/intermediate player ( 800-1600 elo points ), and deals with opening mistakes, the way to avoid them or take advantage of them. In fact, all the examples are very good, as well as the explanations that are also very clear because they point out where the mistake was made.The only problem is that Pandolfini put together all the examples according to the winning move ( Qh5/Axf7/etc ), instead of the opening line.It is fair to say that you can find an index at the end of the book with all the examples classified by opening, but following the reading of the book with it is not very comfortable. But I strongly recommend this way of reading to take advantage of the material, because you can focus on the opening lines that you play regularly or the ones that you want to improve."
2,Another book to avoid,"From time to time I buy a book by Pandolfini thinking that maybe I'll like it better than his others. I always regret it, and this book was no exception."
1,How to Lose Fast.,"If you wanna learn to lose really fast this is a great book for that. Maybe it will help you beat someone rated in the 600-900 range at best. I really do not know why they print books that are this bad. I think it is to make sure some people just never get better at chess. By some games that I play it seems like it has worked on a few people. Basically the only value from this book is comical. Not cuz of anything the writer wrote, but cuz its just so bad. You look in book and at positions and some of the moves. Hard to stop from bursting out in laughter over how absurd and bad the moves are. So throw your money away on this book if thats what you wanna do. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. You can drop your kid off at school but can't make him learn. Enjoy this review, its written better than this book."
2,Cheap Quality and only 6ft long,"I expected this cable would be the standard 9 ft length. That might not be a problem for some, but it is for me. Cheap quality construction just adds to my disappointment."
4,It does the job,"I have one of the first Xbox 360s with no HDMI out. No complaints other than them using Fed-Ex. (meh) Plugged it in and am now enjoying the a way crisper, clearer picture. There are 2 yellow outs that aren't marked as audio out or yellow video, so just follow the cord up to the base and use the yellow next to the red to complete the audio portion of hooking it up."
1,DO NOT GET!!,"DO NOT GET THESE CABLES UNLESS YOU WANT TO FLUSH $20 RIGHT DOWN THE POOPER! Seriously, I bought these and they didn't work at all. They plugged in and stuff but it ruined the picture by taking away the colors. HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A great processor. Potential is Unfathomable!,"This processor is ONE OF THE BEST for overclocking, speed, power, multi-processing for your money on the market period.At a standard 2.66ghz factory speed, this processor with a good heatsink/fan can be cranked up to 4 Ghz or more EASILY.3 ghz is a very fast speed, and 4 is insane. To have a dual core intel processor at almost 3 ghz standard is great ESPECIALLY for the money.This is such a cheap to purchase and incredibly strong and reliable processor, it is one of my very favorites, and if i had the time i would buy a couple to overclock and build a server for the games i play.If you have a 775 motherboard and it accepts pentium d processors with 533 fsb on the motherboard, then GET THIS."
4,Great Movie,This movie was definately one of the best. It is in close competition with the second movie. A must see if you love Saw!
5,The third time's the charm!,"This was another great movie. I now have all three and truly enjoy the quality and content. Thank you, Amazon, for the advanced sale option!"
2,"Not as good as ""Saw""","Kind of boring, not very creative, not suspenseful or gorey at all. Very different than the first ""Saw."""
1,1 because I had too,"The first film was original and well done. All you needed was the two people, and the background story. Saw 2, 3, and now 4 (you wished the game was over.) do nothing more than make money from general movie goers who like to be told what to like. save your money and buy toilet paper, its the same thing."
1,"DUMB, DUMB, DUMB!","This film is stupid. It is gross and torture to see, just like the other two in the crappy movie series. Ignore this schlock and get an inteligent horror film."
4,All the pieces of the puzzle come together.....,"All I gotta say is that the Saw franchise continues to impress me. I mean, Tobin Bell can do no wrong as Jigsaw the killer!!! He is truly an amazing actor. Now as for the storyline, it is a simple yet very intense one. Jigsaw and Amanda have set up another twisted game for two people. One is a female doctor who is having an affair on her husband and the other is a man who hasn't come to terms with the death of his young son. Who was the victim of a car accident at the hands of a drunk driver. But the two of them will have to figure out their connection to one another, to survive Jigsaw's game and to make matters worse. Jigsaw may not have that long to live, as he too must fight to stay alive long enough to finish is his dangerous game."
3,GOOD ENTRY IN THE SERIES! WAY BETTER THAN SAW 2!,"I was so disappointed with 'Saw 2' that I almost skipped this film entirely.....I'm glad I didn't. In this third installment they go back to the roots of the first film and come up with an entertaining sequel. The version I watched on cable was not extremely gory to me but, it had enough blood and aftermaths to make most gorehounds happy. This is definitely worth a look."
3,Signs of a series getting tired,"The inventiveness is gone in this film, and while there's plenty of gore it doesn't have the ingenuity that made the first two films so effective. It's just about worth seeing but nothing great.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
5,The Epic Saw Film!!!,"To me, Saw III is more epic because it's longer and has more soap opera elements to Amanda and Jigsaw's character. Tobin Bell does another awesome job as Jigsaw, who is now on his death bed. Jigsaw has Lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if Jeff makes it through his test. Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines. I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain. Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out! If you love Jigsaw and the Saw movies, you'll love SAW 3!!!"
5,Death of Jigsaw,"This movie is simply crazy, every choice effects everything, too bad Jigsaw had to go, I still don't beleive he's dead"
3,boring,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could complete his collection ."
3,this movie for certain type of people not every one enjoy watching it.,not suitable for under age pleople...eighteen years and a bove...
2,Hope this was the last one,"I have appreciate the first one, it was in a way very original.The second chapter has succeed in creating a surprise, but the last chapter is the weakest of the three. I just hope that this one the last one, don't make a serie like Friday the 13th....please !"
3,Saw 3,"This movie is terrible and sick. I never wanna see It again I have never seen nobody so sick minded and make people suffer. part 1. was crazy and scary. 2. was good and 3. was ok but to much suffering and killing. If you like movies with lots of suffering see saw 3. I not saying It's the worse but this movie is __________. If you seen saw 1 and 2 oh you will be surpised about who is really the killer, and there will be a saw 4 trust me."
4,"Not Quite The Original, But Much Better Than Saw II","I was very pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. After seeing the genuis of Saw and the absolute stupidity of Saw II, I expected this movie to be more of the same from Saw II, however, I was wrong. I thought this movie was much better than having some people trapped in a house. There was only really 1 twist in Saw II, but Saw III is filled w/ different twists and turns in the climactic last 10 minutes of the film. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of good horror films."
2,"Less then expected, more gore then anything","Not the best to come out of the Saw line. It does wrap up some questions in the plot, but the gore is over the top, which is naturally for effect. I hope the final installment goes back to the roots with a decent plot and skill in the game of puzzles."
1,Its all downhill from here.,Have you ever seen a sequel that was as good as the original? Certainly not. This time is no different. Saw I was decent. Saw II was an insult. Saw III was zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... a snoozer ...
1,NO MORE PLEASE,"I enjoyed the first saw and kinda like the second BUT THIS HAS GOT TO STOP NO MORE OF THE CRUEL HEARTLESS [...].FIRST IT WAS PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T APPRECIATE LIFE NOW IT ANY OLD HASBEEN OR NO NAME D TALENTED ACTOR .I AM WILLING TO WATCH ANOTHER SAW MOVIE ONLY IF PARIS HILTON,NICOLE RICHIE AND LINDSAY LOHAN ARE ATTACH LARGE BOULDER AND DROP IN SOME IN SUPER DEEP QUICK SAND"
5,Clearly vengeance only makes you angrier,"Jigsaw is back, but his disease is defeating him little by little. Amanda's story is further detailed and how her relationship with John built over the last year or so in the timeline. The bathroom scene with Amanda and John was great to see as the set up for the game was in motion. How Amanda's emotions would get the best of her and killing Adam was sad to see. In the end, Saw III was great and will lead into an awesome sequel with a bigger revalation."
3,"Better than the second Saw, but still doesn't rise to the original.","Picking up minutes after the end of Saw II, Jigsaw [Tobin Bell] is very near the end of his life. With the help of Amanda [Shawnee Smith], he kidnaps a doctor [Bahar Soomekh] who must choose between keeping Jigsaw alive until another victim can play his game, or death. The other victim, Jeff [Angus MacFadyen], is promised that he will meet the person responsible for the loss of his child if he can pass a series of tests. The two victims, doctor and father, play their games while an agitated Amanda tries to keep her temper and jealousy under control and prevent herself from offing the doctor herself. Although this Saw movie is more satisfying than the second, with a twist ending that is significantly different than the last two, it is still a puzzle thriller, not rising to the level of the truly horrifying original."
3,Eh,"Not as good as the original, typical horror flick. Nice twist in the story as with all the Saw films. Not for me though, once youve seen it, its not that re-watchable."
2,It doesn't make sense.,"With the rise of Blu ray, one would think that for the Saw series, the best versions would be made available. Pity this is not the case. The Unrated Director's Cut of Saw III clocks in at 121 minutes. The blu ray gives us only the unrated version, at 113 minutes. Why? It joins the original Saw on blu ray, offered in an R rated form. Yet, parts 2,4,and 5 are the longest versions offered. Why would blu ray get the lesser versions of part 1 and 3? No idea. As for the picture and sound, well they are crisp, loud and all they should be. If you own the 121 minute version of Saw III on DVD, I would keep it at least until Lionsgate deems us worthy of it on Blu ray."
5,Best of the 3,"I did not think that they could do better than Saw 2, so was I in for a pleasant surprise.Everything has gotten better with saw, and this time they have truly outdone themselves. The plot is better, and there is more of everything than in 1 or 2.More blood, more traps, more characters and storylines..just more of everything.Also there seem to be a lot more twists and turns in this one.Another thing I liked about it , is that it picked up right where Saw 2 left off, as Amanda in closing the door on the cop.This movie is so good, and so full of surprises, that I can't say anymore or it will spoil it. I will only say that Jigsaw is still alive in this movie, not dead dead like I thought from Saw 2.This would be very hard to top if they decide to make a Saw 4 !"
1,Just awful,"Plot? what plot? This movie didn't engage me in the least. And it also suffers from that ""jerky camera syndrome"" that seems to affect most of the movies today. I suspect this piece of tripe appeals to the anime, piercing and tattoo ""video gaming is a sport"" crowd, who still live at home when they're over 18. But if you have an IQ over 80 and work for a living, forget it and save your dough. Just pop in one of the many dawn of the dead movies, at least you'll care what happens to the characters."
3,"Entertaining, but gory","I've seen all the Saw movies and this one is much like the first 2, but with more gore and less suspense or mystery. So I would have to say this was the least interesting of the three. But the movie provides closure, I just hope they don't make another-not sure what is left to tell. This was the first Blu Ray disc I watched on my PS3. I also own the Toshiba A1 HD DVD player so I've seen a lot of high def movies. As with most high def movies, the picture was very sharp and saturated in brighter scenes. In darker scenes, the picture was more noisy and looked like regular DVD. But I have seen this on all high def movies so I don't think Saw 3 was a bad transfer. If you liked the first 2, then you'll probably like this one too."
4,I liked the sequal,"This is a very different Saw than the other 2 previous ones. I liked this one because it was a totally different scenario. Yes, it was still gruesome and gorey but the story was a different one. If you are a fan of the Saw trilogies, then see this one. If you are not, then see another horror flick. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes the Saw trilogies."
2,How not to wear a bandolier,"The first two outings of the Jigsaw Killer were ingenious, creative, and very entertaining. The puzzle and Grand Guignol elements used in both raised the bar for the slasher genre. So it's sad that SAW III is such a disappointment. The ingenuity has gone, the plot (what there is of it) is incoherent, and the characters are underdeveloped and their motives dubious. There's plenty of gore here but not much else. The only good thing I can say about it is that it's slickly done."
4,A nice end to the trilogy...,"This should have in my opinion been the final movie. It was a trilogy and you don't want to bleed the franchise dry. Unfortunately money came into effect and there are now 6 Saw movies. The movie follows a man's path of revenge against those that hurt his son. He decides for the victims whether to let them die or help them survive. It is really connected to Saw IV so watch them back to back. Also it revolves a lot around Jigsaw's assistant. Without ruining the plot points I won't give away who that is. Also a doctor was chosen to help save Jigsaw. There are a lot of connections to Saw I and II, which help the movie. There is a lot of great character development that was a bit lacking in Saw II. The ending is awesome, perhaps the best in the series. It really ties all the characters together and leaves you breathless."
2,Average overall,"I don't care how gory this film is, it still does not come close to the bloodbath at the end of Scorsese's Casino with the baseball bat thuds one of the all time squirm sounds. Simple but true, fact is always worse than fiction."
3,The last not-awful Saw,"The Bottom Line:Ahhh the halcyon days of 2006, when the ridiculous Saw franchise was somewhat less ridiculous for its villain was at least not killing people from beyond the grave; Saw III is certainly no great film (it's not even a good film) but with a plot that makes a reasonable amount of sense and a couple creatively grisly scenes, it's at least better than IV or V.2/4"
4,Saw 3,"Much more gruesome and not as good as the first but still disgustingly entertaining, twisted, and surprising. It could have been better but hey, after the first one was so groundbreaking it is hard to meet that standard again."
1,what happened?,"I loved world ov worms, it is still one of my favourite albums to this day. Aeon, well i can only see it as a big step back for Zyklon. they sacrificed speed to be the next morbid angel crossover band. behemoth did it much better, and actually progressed their sound, but zyklon, they actually sound like morbid angel, and thats not a good thing. some albums grow on me, but i've tried many times with Aeon, and it refuses to grow. i'll keep trying, and maybe then i'll understand how all you people think it's even remotely good. if you loved world ov worms, and havent heard aeon, dont be surprised if you find it incredibly boring."
4,Was the best yet to come??,"I became a fan of Kevin Smith by seeing ""Chasing Amy"". ""Clerks"", although the first, was the second Viewaskew film I saw. Although funny and entertaining, I don't think I would have liked it as much if I didn't know the back story.That being said, this DVD is a must to have in your collection, if for nothing more than the introductions to characters that will pop up in Smith's future outings.Check out the alternate ending. Thank God they didn't use it."
2,"Funny, But Not Worth The Hype","Clerks has some funny moments, but overall, i felt like it was a bit too long for such a pointless plot (or lack of it). I don't see why this movie is so hyped, i was expecting to get more laughs from it. I dunno, i just didn't find it as hilarious as people make it out to be. It's just an okay, mediocre, decent comedy."
2,Waste of Time,"I cannot see why this trashy movie got such a high rating, except that as a culture we've accepted vulgarity and rudeness as being funny. While Kevin Smith seems capable of providing intelligent dialog for his characters, he opts for mostly shock effect. Howard Stern would be proud. Some reviewers said the movie was good because it captured the ethos of low-paid clerks, but I think it was more about two obscene idiots manning a store. There was one part of the movie I found hilarious, though: when the cat took a dump on the counter in front of the customer. The expressions on both the animal's and the customer's faces were priceless. This movie is definitely not for kids!!"
1,Boring!,"Why anyone cares what the idiots potrayed in this movie have to say is beyond me. Maybe it is a must see for Howard Stern fans or those so desperate to be ""hip"" or cutting edge they abandon their intelligence. Don't bother if you that doesn't describe you."
1,I could have liked this movie...,"If I didn't see Mallrats first. I bought this movie because Mallrats was awesome, and found that after that movie (which my buddies and I still watch every now and again) this movie totally blows. Perhaps it's the B&W;, perhaps the budget, but I think it's the script and lack of directorial experience. Sorry Kevin, this one's a stinker. I'm glad so many people disagree with me, or one of my favorite movies would have never come to existence. That's all I have to say about that.P.S. The original ending would have upped my rating, but since it was cut, nevermind"
1,Moronic.,This movie just proves that simply using extremely foul language does not make something funny.
5,the brilliance of writer director kevin smith,"clerks is a brilliant movie that all to often finds it self remembered for its crude sexual humor. when in reality clerks is the study of life, it is everything and nothing all at the sametime. it's also a rather classic love story in which a guy has blown it with his girlfriend and has to try and fix matters before they escalate. and all in all the writing of this film is some of the sharpest you will ever hear, its a movie in which you can close your eyesand let the words carry you along. and if you enjoy this film i highly recomend his other two films, Mallrats and Chasing Amy which are on their own seperate levels of brilliance. keep an eye out for his next film dogma ( this man is also one of the major reasons good will hunting exists)"
2,Five Stars? Please...,"Let me just say for the record that I love balck and white in films and that I have worked in retail. Given that, the film still blows. The reviewer below was right, not by praising it, but by comparing it to a student film. This movie is the definition of amateurish. Uninspired direction, hopelessly bad acting, contrived situations and only a mild amount of laughs. Maybe worth a rental, but that's about it. Maybe..."
4,In your face laughs,"Well I was laughing from the start. The pace and look makes me think of all the crap I video-taped in high school (my friends and I doing nothing but argueing and goofing off) The humor is definitely ""no holes barred"" but that just adds to the appeal. I did find it a bit faulty at times when the script and the lines these people were saying became almost too well-written, and thus, not as believable. But over-all, it's great fun!"
5,Ultimate Clerks package,Great movie and a nice little box set. Comes with all kinds of little extras and neat reading material. We be a great addition to any Kevin Smith fan's collection!
3,Retail at its finest!,"I've worked retail for several years, so I can certainly sympathize with the plight of these two convenience store clerks. If the customer's not entirely brain-dead, he's so demanding that absolutely nothing can be done to make him happy. The story seems to wander and meander at times, especially concerning the clerks' private lives, and there are scenes that appear to have been written haphazardly just to get them in the film, but the encounters with the various customers - all realistic, by the way - makes this film a good watch."
2,Great movie but a weak DVD,"I ordered my Collector's Edition of Clerks early an anticapated it's release more than anyone I knew. When it finally arrived the excitment overwhelmed me. However, the deleted scenes are just long versions of the scenes in the movie; the audio commentary tells you nothing about how the movie was made. It was just a bunch of drunk guys sitting around laughing about how much they like the movie and their favorite parts. I love this movie, but the lame extras on this DVD pull my rating down. If you want something for your money get the Collector's Edition of Good Will Hunting."
4,"funny, though definitely vulgar","I had the fortune to see Clerks before I saw any of Kevin Smith's other movies. The grittiness of this little film would indeed have been murkier had I compared it to its glossier decendants. Since it was a sketchy, low-budget-type movie, it would understandably be deemed ""unrefined"" in light of Smith's big-money movies like Dogma.Being twenty-something, I found a lot of the humor was based on pop-culture I was in tune with (there's a a couple of funny dialogues about the Star Wars trilogy, for example). However, those who are averse to vulgar locker-room language should probably skip this one. There's plenty of talk about sex, porn and drugs. Those who aren't thus offended will find good one-liners and witty exchanges. The acting, I'll admit, was somewhat cheesy."
3,"The First, but not the best","All right, I would love to say I enjoyed this movie throughly. But unfortunately, I can't. This was...well...not really all that good. Dont' get me wrong, Kevin Smith is brilliant, but the humor was just too dark in this first movie. Later on, in his other movies, Kevin really lets his true self shine, but if you're looking for a good movie to start your obsession of ViewAskew Productions, don't start with this one."
2,Unique but not clever.,"Kevin Smith in this, his first effort, writes dialogue that would be more believable in a comic book than in a movie. The lines seem too cute and don't convey any depth or indiviuality to any of the characters, rather, it is like listening to a play written by someone in high school being read by someone in high school. The actors are not good enough to make up for the lack of realism in the dialogue or the ubiquitous voice of Smith. His most recent movie, Chasing Amy, on the other hand, is proof that Smith is getting more original and deep with his characters."
5,Awesome,"If you havn't seen this movie you need to it is funny,Especially when u consider it was made on a 15,000 dollar budget"
1,Black and White?,"I was prepared to laugh when I slipped Clerks into my DVD player, but the moment I saw it was black and whit I took it out and returned it. I own every Jay and Silent Bob movie (and the Clerks animated series) on DVD, but refuse to buy this 'till a colored version comes out."
4,Good writing and casting make this worthwhile,A decent flick. I got a lot of laughs. I saw this after seeing Clerks 2 and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. It's kinda neat to see how their characters evolved in the later movies.
5,Awsome movie but...,"I wish I would have gotten a different edition, this one is pretty crappy, any way, This is a great movie, with memorable lines like Im not even supposed to be here today, or The salsa shark, or 36 *****, any way, you will have to see it to know what Im talking about, This is probably my favorite Smith film. Buy the DVD, but don't get this edition, get the Clerks X version, It's a set, plus MUCH better picture... my friend has that version, Ok later"
5,"If You've Seen the Movie, You'll Understand...",Man's in the cage...Cage is in the Salsa...Shark's in the Salsa......OUR SHARK...
3,Disappointing,"After seeing the excellent movie ""Dogma"", also by Kevin Smith, I was expecting a great movie that was interesting, intellectually stimulating , cynical, and hilarious throughout. In the end, though, I found this movie very boring for the most part.At many points it just seemed like senseless rambling to me, espessially in vulgarity. I wasn't offended, as I don't thing vulgarity is always bad, but I just felt like it brought the movie down somewhat.I would suggest seeing ""Dogma,"" which I think is a masterpeice in many respects, and really shows Kevin Smith's talent thourogly..Again, in the end, this movie has great scenes that really make you think and show Kevin Smith's intelligence, but many of them just make you laugh by the simple fact that you are supposed to..."
4,"""Clerks X"" DVD Review","It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since Kevin Smith burst onto the scene with his independent breakthrough hit, ""Clerks"". Since then he's maintained a rather loyal following with subsequent follow-ups like ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"". Filmed on a shoestring budget with no-name local talent and little more than an imaginative script, ""Clerks"" went on to become one of the biggest independent features released in 1994. For its tenth anniversary, Miramax has dug up anything and everything that any Clerks fan could possibly want. You get to see the original ""festival circuit"" director's cut version of the film with its original ending (though it is presented in somewhat shabby quality), a brand-new feature-length documentary, an animated adaption of a ""lost scene"", and tons of other cool special features. If you're even the smallest fan of Kevin Smith's debut film, this DVD should offer everything you want and then some."
2,Rather overrated,"This is one of those movies that I bought simply because so many people told me how wonderful it was. I've gotta say that even with some funny dialog and good ideas, it doesn't deserve anything close to the credit it gets.The dialog is really what kills this movie. The actors are pretty amateurish, and the delivery of lines is wooden and completely unnatural. The whole movie is based around conversations, and while the actual text of the script is good, the actors don't pull it off.It's pretty easy to make me laugh. But, as this movie stands, it only evoked a few chuckles. Not worth the price tag."
4,Great movie,Very funny movie. Definitely hits a chord with the younger generation. Great use of low-budget filmmaking techniques. An inspiration to anyone wanting to break into Hollywood.
2,"Wildly Overated, Trite, Pretensious","Boy, that Kevin Smith fella sure is clever. Or that's what he'd have us believe, anyway. His forte is painting cruel caricatures of people and having us laugh at these one-dimensional representations of human beings as they do improbably cruel things to each other. I guess you could glean some sort of philosophical staement from this, but don't try. Just know that in every Smith film there is a lot of intellectual jerking off and bad acting. I mean, Jesus, the acting in this film was cringe-inducing. The only redeeming aspect of the flick was Jason Mewes delightful performance as a caustic, foul-mouthed drug peddler."
3,A hi-def version of a low-def film?,"Seems a bit silly to have this in hi-def, per IMDB it was filmed using a 16mm Arri SR-2 camera and used Kodak Plus-X film, decidely NOT hi-def. Oh well, for those that must have everything in BRD, here's another."
1,"Horrible acting, contrived dialogue....","I don't think I even watched the whole thing, which I know isn't fair to the movie, but hey, this movie wasn't fair to me."
1,My copy doesn't work.,My copy freezes up and stops responding to my input when I try to play the first cut. I tried cleaning it and it still doesn't work.
1,I must be missing something...,"Okay, I don't see what everyone else sees in this movie, I guess. In my opinion this was the biggest waste of, what, two hours? that I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Kevin Smith and his View Askew Production Company have made so many great movies...I assumed Clerks would be good too...There were maybe 2 funny parts throughout the entire movie, certainly not worth buying or even renting...Maybe if your friend has it you would give it a watch just to say you've seen it, but I wouldn't suggest it. Terrible movie..."
1,Offensive,"This has gotta be the worst script I've ever heard in a movie. Kevin Smith seems to be trying for a world record in tastelessness. His jokes aren't funny or clever, just vulgar. Like other overrated screenwriters like Matt Damon/Ben Affleck and Tarantino, Smith seems to think that there is merit in vulgarity. He doesn't realize that the is NO merit in such. Anyone can think of profanity; it requires niether creativity nor intelligence."
3,Not a movie to be watched more than twice.,"This movie, though quite original, is difficult to watch more than twice. It's full of teenage angst, which finds its outlet at the hands of unsuspecting customers.The film suffers from fair-to-poor acting throughout and is highlighted by dialogue that's crude and that is geared to teens.(...)."
3,animal mineriralo vegitable,"yep wrote this one too.ok i love the jersey saga, but something about this was just diferent.it wasnt the color it wasnt the picture or the people(dante, randal,caitlen,veronica)although some of them ... me off.maybe it was the lack of jay and silent bob.why the ... am i ranting on about sensles things.if you like the jersey saga buyt it today."
4,"The first.The worst,but still good.","Clerks was Kevin Smith's first movie out of 5 and it is the worst.Out of Clerks,Mallrats,Chasing Amy,Dogma,and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back this the worst but is still not all that bad.I guess you could say you can't go wrong with Kevin Smith.Even though it was a low budget movie it still show's even though it is a low budget movie it dosn't have to be bad.it could be the best or the worst,well it was the worst Kevin Smith movie but not of all time,obviously.If you like Kevin Smith see it,but don't be surpised if it isn't as good as the rest."
2,Cult classic but probably best if you're on medication of some sort,"Yes, this is deemed a cult classic however, it is full of poorly delivered dialogue and cheesy one-liners. I would imagine it would be far more entertaining under the influence. Silent Bob is the best actor in the whole thing ... imagine that."
3,Clerks,"Clerks is Semi-Funny,a little too bland and artsy in a bad way at times. I liked Clerks 2 better."
2,Highly overrated,"I seem to be one of the few people who didn't like this movie. People either seem to love or hate this movie. It's obvious in the reviews. Those that love it would be more likely to comment, so I suggest that if you are considering seeing this movie, look for the negitive comments to get a balance.No one talks like they did in the film. I've met a broad spectrum of people from every conceivable profession and, none of them spoke the way the people in this piece-of-crap film do. This movie is so overrated its not even slightly funny."
4,"$27,000 and worth every penny","Ok, just watched it again, and continue to be impressed at how cohesive Smith's work is. The movie, set up almost as a series of vignettes, plots through a somewhat unusual day in Retail Hell. The film is definitely a first, independent effort, set up to showcase talent to the Money. But it definitely has that DIY sensibility, as well as Smith's consistent and dead-on view of people making their way in the world, and making their foolish mistakes.A word of advice to people new to Smith's films - it does help to see the New Jersey Trilogy - Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, in order, both to watch the improved production and maturing throughout hte works,as well as to catch the continual cross-references."
4,Intelligent and fun.,"Clerks really took me by surprise. I've never been a Kevin Smith fan, so I figured this wouldn't be any different. Being a former electronics store ""clerk"", I figured the humor in this might appeal more. Clerks really stands apart, and is quite enjoyable. The dialog is actually intelligent and entertaining, not this pseudo-intellectual garbage going around in most movies. And I like how it never really goes too far.None of the dialog is there just to be there, it's quite believable that these two guys would say all this. Maybe not in one day, but it's a film after all. Entertainment is more important than realism. For anyone who is still empty headed enough to think the clerks at your local store are just slack jawed idiots, this film should be a real eye opener. Kevin Smith himself was a clerk, and the movie was shot where he worked on a shoestring budget. He's also Silent Bob.All in all, watch it at least once. Especially if you've ever been a Clerk."
4,Hilarious,"Believe me, I am NOT a big fan of crude humor. Austin Powers does not interest me the least bit. Which is why, in college, when I sat down to watch this movie I was completely skeptical and prepared myself for hating it.I loved it.Yes, the humor is crude and sophomoric at times, but it is really, really, really funny."
5,Awesome,Clerks is the best movie ever made. It may be in black in white but it is so funny. I have watched it a ton of times. THis version includes the cut scences and also the alternate ending. It a a great deal. Also try mall rats collecectors edition.BEZERKER
5,37.....In a ROW?????,This movie is a CLASSIC. Truly a must own. It gets funnier the more I watch it. I would have loved the original ending but then there wouldn't have been the ability for a second one. Kevin Smith is a genious.
5,Really good movie,This movie is soo funny and laid back. I recommend this movie to people that have a great sense of humor and love jay and silent bob.
4,Clerks Is Still One Of The Best,"Clerks is always going to be one of my favorite movies, and now It's been made better with the addition of blu ray high def sound and better video quality. A couple of places I'm disapointed, however, are that the special features are all in Standard Def, and the first cut of Clerks has not been edited up, even to DVD quality standards, which they are clearly able to do considering the Theatrical cut. Other than that, If you like Kevin Smith, Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob, or have a sense of humor (And a Blu Ray Player) Buy this."
3,Clerks,"I thought this film was good. A cult film by Kevin Smith, with great characters, especially Randall and Dante, also the hilarious Jay and Silent Bob.A good DVD for all Kevin Smith fans to own."
4,What can I say?,"For anyone who has ever wondered what Shakespeare would be writing, were he alive today; look no further than the films of Kevin Smith. Whitty Dialogue, intricate story lines, characters with depth, and baudy humor (to satisfy the rabble in the pit; we smell our own)are the hallmark of his films. This film, the first of what fans have dubbed 'The Jersey Trilogy', is a decent debut for Smith, but the movie drags ever-so-slightly in the middle. It is, however, by no means is a disappointment. The new DVD release comes packed with features and is a ""must have"" for the hardcore fan."
3,"Impressive that it was made by a young man,","but by the time you are 30, you'll know and understand everything this film has to say. I'm an old fart, thus I didn't really learn anything from Clerks, but it had some interesting parts from a cinematic perspective. Net, net, don't see this unless you are under 30, or are really interested in film."
2,why is this so well liked,Perhaps this should be considered a cult film because the only people who claim to like this movie all fit the same description. I just can't enjoy any of Smith's works. I have seen to many films to give him the credit everyone else seems to do.
3,Good first movie with no budget by Kevin Smith,"The film is in black and white and mostly dialogue that is very fast (difficult to keep up with at time, requiring a repeat viewings). However, the topics are very intertaning and funny."
4,help,ok...how come there are no delted scenes on this dvd? and it says all this stuff is on disc 1 but i can't find it....please let me know
2,Bored. Shrug.,"I finally broke down and bought this after a co-worker talked favorably about the Silent Bob series. I've read the mostly-favorable comments about Kevin Smith movies, so...Why was I so bored? I think it was the long periods where the camera did not move, and the actors did not move either. They just talked - about boring things. I've worked retail. I like black and white movies. I can appreciate having no budget. I can appreciate ""dialogue-based"" movies. I found this movie nearly unwatchable.I give it a generous 2 stars for effort, I suppose. Although I would categorize it as ""bad"", it is not as truly horrifically bad as the few movies I have rated worse (Armageddon, Black and White, Lost and Delirious, The Smokers)"
2,Clerks! Where's the story?,"Lame attempt by the inept kevin Smith to score big in the independant film genre, is the movie Clerks. With no real story except for a oddball assortment of caracters and their encounter with even stranger folks as customers.Granted their is a few (very few) good laughs in this attempt of a independant comedy, but not enough to keep the viewer intrested.Pity me I did let a person talk me into watching the sequel Mall Rats, but once again the story failed, due to the fact that the only real thing that the two films have in common is the return of some of the original cast members.Don't waste your time go buy a Tarintino film, like Pulp Fiction, or Resivoir Dogs."
3,"animal,mineral,or vegetable","ok i love the jersey saga, but something about this was just diferent.it wasnt the color it wasnt the picture or the people(dante, randal,caitlen,veronica)although some of them piss me off.maybe it was the lack of jay and silent bob.why the hell am i ranting on about sensles things.if you like the jersey saga buyt it today."
2,Low resolution Black & White source; save your money!,"First off, I love this movie. With that said, it is not worth upgrading this film to blu-ray. As stated in another review, this film was a low budget film shot on cheap low resolution black & white film stock. It may as well have been filmed with a camcorder.The blu ray version is also way over priced. Giving this film a blu ray ""upgrade"" makes as much sense as giving ""The Blair Witch Project"" a blu ray transfer. The source material is crap. If you must have everything blu ray, that's fine, but wait awhile as this one will surely drop in price."
3,the least of thier movies.,"this movie is in black and white which sucks.this is the new age,right?not to mention its an entire movie set entirely inside a convenience store.the 2 (...) guys from jay and silent bob strike back star in this one.they tied the knot as storm troopers.this movie is definately not for any children 17 and under.of the movies with jay and silent bob,only chasing amy was worse.its supposed to be funny but is more just nasty.only those most hardcore of jay and silent bob fans will be ablke to handle this one.theres not even any (...).im sure glad theyve moved on from this one."
5,Don't forget Mallrats next...,"An excellent film, really the first of the trilogy. Each time you watch Clerks you'll notice more of the surprisingly large amount of dark humour missed on first showing. When combined with Mallrats, and then Chasing Amy, you should have an excellent trilogy that you'd be proud to have on your shelves; and unlike some trilogies, each film is complemented and enhanced with the others, leading to an intricate and complex world that is in Kevin Smith's head."
4,"rude, raw, in your face, very funny",yes it's rude and low budget but that's what we like about it. if you find foul language offensive stay away...although that's about all you may find offensive since there's no nudity and almost no violence here. made on a shoestring budget this film highlights the escapades of some NJ clerks and the clients they so grudgingly serve.
3,Clever Dialogue...,"Actually I'd give this 3.5 stars.Midway through I was ready for it to end.My expectations were too high...after seeing Mallrats and Chasing Amy (both of which I LOVE!!!!).DVD has Bonus ""Orignal Ending"".I don't know why they changed it...The Orignal Ending DEFINES Dark Comedy."
3,I used to love this flick. Now I don't.,"A decade or so ago, I was crazy about this movie. It was on my top 20 list. Then, as the years went by, I analyzed what I love about it. The bad acting? The mediocre script? The fact that I laughed about 4 times? What did I love? Silent Bob who didn't say anything throughout the movie? Anyway, I bought it for a friend recently, who works in a convenient store because I thought she'd relate to it. She didn't think it was great, but at least mildly amusing. Nowadays, I honestly think that Clerks is one of those that you're ""supposed to love"", but really, it's just okay."
3,one of the best movies ever made in the history of film..but,"as before mentioned by just about everyone here, clerks is by far one of the best movies ever made (infact it would be #1 if there were no evil dead trilogy), but my problem is that the DVD is simply too expensive. i mean come on, you can pick up the VHS copy of the movie for around $10..yet it costs 4 times as much to buy the DVD which is even cheaper to produce! would you give these people (disney) that much extra money to kill you and your family!? because that is what you are doing! taking hard earned money from your pocket that is used to feed your loving family and just throwing it away to disney which OBVIOUSLY doesnt deserve it now do they?! thats right, we are all over you disney and we are going to shut you down at the source!"
2,Disappointing,"The worst of the five movies to date. I found this pretty boring in the fact that nothing much happens. Even though I find the end to 'Chasing Amy' unsatisfactory, the original ending to this might have helped me in ensuring that this pap can never have a sequel.Let's face it folks nothing happens. Thank God Jay and Bob are in this to alleviate the lags of action.Key follow up question. Does everyone in the US smoke? All they seem to want to do are buy cigarettes...I'm sure that people can read any amount of subliminal psycho-analytical mumbo-jumbo into this, but hey, after university, I occasionally want to sit down and enjoy something which leads somewhere without having to go into theorising over juxtaposition, and the passage from light to lucidity.From all tragedy springs humour, in this case, only a minor yawn can be engendered.Start the series with Mallrats, and avoid this one."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Everybody has probably seen Clerks 2 before this one because of its popularity. Clerks is in black and white the entire length of the movie, that is not to say its bad. It does have its funny moments, but nothing that will make you curl over laughing like Clerks 2. I believe this first movies kind of introduces Randal's and Dante's personalities.Not a bad movie, but overall maybe 3stars."
2,Overrated,"I didn't like this one. I'm not quite sure why. There are several quite funny parts, and it's a good idea, but .. it feels too hip and shallow. Like Seinfeld without the charm, a nihilistic 90's comedy about nothing. If this is all independent directors have to offer, I think I'll rather have one of those glossy Hollywood movies Leonard Maltin's sneering at."
2,Not the best movie from Kevin Smith.,"I don't think this is bad because it is porley made,just because it's not funny.Kevin Smith wasn't being a genius here.I don't get it ,the rest of Kevin Smith's movie's are great.I think it's because he was just starting his directing career.I think the funniest person in that movie was Randall.I think it's funny that he works at the video store and never goes in,I think he was funnier in the cartoon series.I think Dontay is funny in the movie but a little to serious,but of course Brian O'Halloran has been in every Kevin Smith movie.Jay I think is the funniest part of this...comedy,he is funny in every movie he's in.Kevin Smith is not funny because he dosen't do anything but not talk and stand outside the Quick Stop.Once again it is Kevin Smith's worst movie."
5,"More than a movie,it's a way of life","As soon as I picked up the box and read the summary on the back,I had a feeling that this was a different kind of movie.What I didn't realize was that I was just about to watch the most influential film for the new generation of 20 somethings.The ""intelligent filth""that spews forth from our two heroes,Dante and Randall,was unlike anything I had encountered outside of a night at the local pub with my friends. If you like intelligent dialogue,loads of swears,or ever worked in any aspect of the customer service industry,then this is the movie you MUST see."
4,Vulgar Brilliance!,"Have you ever thought of what would happen if someone made an art form out of vulgarity? (In a movie, no less!) Well, Kevin Smith has done it and done it well. With witty, swear-drenched dialogue, a simple plot that most of us can relate to (who hasn't been a clerk?), and slacker characters, this is one hilarious comedy. Warning this not for the uptight, conservatives or comically challenged."
4,"kevin smith, the vulgar truth","i saw clerks and thought someone ought to speak an intelligent view about the film. with a budget of only 30,000 (give or take a little) kevin smith skillfully creates a plot that happens around the motionless existence of a jersey convience store. its not gross or even vulgar, its real. people do say things about sex, and as shocking as that may sound, sometimes they even get graphic. it should also be noted that kevin smith's message in the movie, is that only acceptence of such events like people discussing their sexual past, can lead to true understanding. when you try to hide, your girlfriend winds up having sex with a dead guy in the bathroom of the local 7-11. and in a secondary note, randle is the second coolest character ever (banky edwards, of chasing amy, is the first)."
5,STILL GREAT AFTER SIX YEARS,"This movie became one of my all-time, favorites in 1994 and I always recommend it to anyone looking for a movie. It was fresh in 1994 and it still is as funny and fresh in 2000. The line ""I'm not even supposed to be here today"" is one of those memorable lines that anyone who's seen the movie can recognize the minute they hear it."
2,"Great movie, but not a great DVD","My first viewing of ""Clerks"" was in a movie theatre, and I laughed so hard that I didn't even notice how bad it looked. It was made for $27000 and it shows. I think it's a great film and that homemade quality adds appeal, but it looks particularly cheesy on DVD. My main reason for giving this a mediocre 2 stars is the quality of the extras. The deleted scenes are just stuck on the disc, and the commentary track by Kevin Smith and cohorts is poorly recorded and for the most part uninsightful. It's funny in parts - particularly enjoyed hearing Smith belch and hiccup, and Jason Mewes snore - but really not for the reasons you'd expect. Still, I'd say buy the DVD if it weren't so damn expensive. The film cost about a nickel to make, and not much more was put into producing the DVD extras. This just isn't worth the money. IF you must own ""Clerks,"" get the VHS version or wait for the price to come down on the DVD."
5,Kevin Smith's breakthough film,"This film is a great example of how clever writing is more valuable than a huge budget. Kevin Smith made this movie on maxed-out credit cards, but it's still a classic because it is well written and the characters are memorable.The DVD has plenty of features, including an alternate ending that might have changed the perception of the film and a good commentary track.This is a must-have title for any fan of any Kevin Smith film."
3,"Great movie, wrong price Disney","I loved the movie, but Disney stuck a high price tag on the DVD. The Pleasantville DVD includes 2 commentaries, storyboards, documentaries for less. I will still buy the DVD, but wait till you find a sale or Disney lowers the price."
2,extra cheesy,"Sorry. I did not like this movie at all. Most of the dialogue sounded very scripted and contrived... reminded me of a high school play. Since when do customers go into a store and say 'a pack of cigarettes, please'. Quite frankly, I was bored through most of this film. I realize that this movie was made on a shoestring budget but the camera work was pretty lousy like there was a single camera used or something. Probably the only redeeming value of the movie is the modern-ish soundtrack and the fact that it was filmed in black and white."
3,A Clerk's Life,"Bought the movie so that I could study the fundamentals of script writing, at least, that's the excuse I used and I'm sticking to it. It wasn't a bad movie being that it was the director's first attempt at it. I actually enjoyed seeing it in black and white film. It kind of reminded me of the movies I saw when I was a kids in the 1960's. Okay, it was funny to watch. I'd recommend getting it and the squeal. In a way I wished it to was in black and white but I guess when Hollywood throws money your way to make it better, you use it. Anyway, it was fun to watch. So go ahead and get it and invite your buddies over for a laugh."
4,Gotta Love It,"Okay, I went back and watched this again after all the other Kevin Smith movies came out. This movie, in the ""View Askewniverse"", is essential, because plot lines, jokes, and people from most of Smith's other movies all have their seeds in ""Clerks"". Sure, Dante's whiny, Randall is an *ss, the acting is lousy, and the film maker's personal obsessions make up the majority of the dialogue, but, well, it's just damn funny - and it's happening right now at your neighbourhood 7-11."
2,Can you spare about 3 hours every day?,"You are suposed to do a minimum of 12 exercises every day. The Egoscue method is totally spoiled by two these exercises because they are very time consuming. One called the ""supine groin stretch"" requires one and a half hours(45 minutes for each leg); the ""static back"" requires 30 minutes. The others take about 5 minutes each with the exception of the ""air bench"" which takes 3 minutes but is so hard to perform. Total: 3 hours every morning. What time do you have to get up for work?(I bought the Egoscue video cassette fron their website but I was totally disappointed: only 3 of the exercises are demonstratedand the quality is very poor)."
2,disappointed,"I loved my friends the ""Pain Free"" book by the same author that he published earlier so when I saw he had a newer one and for women I immediately ordered it. What a disappointment! The author goes on and on and nowhere you can look up and go right to the point when you hurting like in his previous book. Will have to buy that older one to know what to start with for my prob. Very unclear and frustrating. Why can't he stick with what worked?"
3,Needs some overhaul,While I totally agree with the value of the exercises I do not necessarily agree with Egoscue's philosophy. But my only problem with the entire book is the poor quality of the images. Simple drawings would have been better.
3,Pain Free for Wome,"Unless You are pregnant of have various pains throughout your body, don't get this book. It focuses a lot on fixing pains you might not have, so to that degree it seems like a waste of money. But it does have some decent exercises that are easy to do; I just didn't need a whole book on just fixed my gluteal and sciatic pain, exercises for which the book does have some good advice."
5,great CD,This CD has a modern background with the traditional words and rythms mixed in the foreground. This is a great CD for anyone who want to hear traditional native american music in a setting other than meditation. This one will NOT put you to sleep!
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to get this pedometer. It looks good and reviews were not too bad.Now that I have gotten this pedometer, I am finally able to leave my honest review. If you have to change the battery, grow claws in order to open up the back. To view your distance walked/calories burned, etc.That's another challenge. These are terrible design flaws.the item is NOT that cheap. I am honestly very disappointed....the jury is still out on how well it functions."
3,"Worthy, yeah, but unsatisfying","OK, it's true: people do put too much stock in prophecy, especially when it's made by the scientific community. But Max Dublin's relentless attack on just about every aspect of ""futurology"" is a little too depressing for my tastes. So Buckminster Fuller's inventions won't change the world - isn't there room for dreamers in our society?The solution, perhaps, lies somewere between what Dublin says andhow things are: we need people prepared to guess at what the future might be like and how it could be better than today, but we also need to recognise that everything these people say is just an educated guess, at best, and not a foregone conclusion.At any rate, the writing is tight and the argument is certainly worth a look, but you might find the leaden tone a little offputting."
3,The Singing Rage - Miss Patti Page,"She sold more albums than any other female artist. She ruled the '50's. This album includes her earlier hits and Vol. 2 has 'Allegheny Moon', 'Old Cape Cod' etc. Her voice speaks for itself. The newer 'Carnegie Hall' and 'New Tennesse Waltz' albums will show you how little her voice has changed over the years."
3,My sister soul sister,It was very hard for me to finish this book. I did appericate the fact the the ladies are strong but in the end learned how to appericate a good man.
4,It was a good read,I truly enjoyed reading this book. I love Aunt Toe. She was my favorite character in the book. I enjoyed reading about the trials and triumphs of the sister's and daughter's lives. The book took me for a loop about Diane but it was very interested about the secret that Joyce Ann had over Gloria. I knew it had to be more.
3,Nice book. Could be shorter though.,"This book was nice, but could stand do lose a few pages/chapters. I enjoyed the book, but sort of felt there was tooooo much drama. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but I felt after a while that the author needed to reign it in."
5,Great Read!!,"This book is a book that anybody could enjoy. Their are some parts that make you laugh, and some parts that make you cry. Very thought provoking, entertaining, and a ministry of Gods healing love and true desire for every family. I would recommend this book for anyone."
4,"Stable, but don't pour too fast","I bought this as I do a lot of stir frying and wanted to have a very functional (yet attractive) oil decanter sitting on my counter. This one is well made and stable. My only complaint is that you absolutely have to pour the oil at a slow speed or the oil will come out the top. (This is due to the spout being at the base of the decanter.) If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably search for a top spout decanter, but I do like this one despite my need for speed."
4,"good, but wish I had a little more control","This oil decanter is good, but I wish that it drizzled the oil in a smaller amount. Also, when you tilt it too far horizontally, it leaks from the lid. But it's well-made and beautiful, and does what the manufacturer describes. I just really wanted a different one (that I can't find anywhere), and this was the best of the rest. A good deal for the price."
2,Lovely but messy,"This is a gorgeous looking decanter that is comfortable and presentable. However, it is extremely messy. The contents leak through the lid and create a mess especially as the level gets low."
5,Mr Willowby's Christmas Tree,"Wonderful book and story. This was for my very young Granddaughter, but even at 4 months of age, she sat on my lap and looked at all the pictures as I read her the story. I hope she will always have a love of books and a good story."
5,Best Christmas Book Ever!,This book is a delightful and enduring story which has been our family tradition to read every Christmas Eve since 1963. I still read it to my children even though they are 34 and 27! I also buy it for each new baby born in our family. I can't understand why stores don't stock this every Christmas season.
5,Cute story,Kept the attention of my 5 and 7 year old granddaughters. Fun illustrations and very cute story. This will be read all year not just at Christmas time.
4,sweet Christmas story,"Cute story about a wealthy man whose tree is too big so he cuts off the top, and gives it to someone else, who cuts off the top... It is about the joy of Christmas, no matter how big your tree. My kids like it."
5,Wonderful story for all ages,"I loved this book as a child and am still enchanted today! My children want me to read it year round. Five stars are not enough for this book. Not only is the story entertaining, but it teaches recyclying on a young childs level. If you want a book to pass down through many generations, I strongly recommend Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree!"
3,Illustrations are not colorful,I would have liked to have known that the illustrations were not colorful like is found in other copies of Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree. Cover is not colorful either. It's a hard back book that looks like it's missing its cover.
3,Not as fantastic as the reviews show.,"I expected much more from this book based on the reviews. It is a little boring, the story is lacking, and my kids lost interest."
2,Mr Willwby's Christmas Tree,"The story is delightful, and I will be able to read it to my grandson, which is what I wanted the book for, but it was not what I would have described as in good condition. It is covered with grimy fingerprints, written on inside the cover, and has a substantial break in the binding. I certainly cannot let my grandson carry this book around, as I'm sure that at the tender age of two, he is not capable of uderstanding the concept of ""Handle with care"", which is how this book will need to be treated."
5,Even as an adult I loved this book!! I will read it every year!,I thought this book was great. My son who is almost 5 and I both enjoyed it and have read it numerous times. I would recommend this book for sure! Too cute!
3,Very noirish,"The lead character is trapped in a loveless marriage to a girl who spends her life drinking, he works for her father's company and yearns for the secretary.Enter an old war buddy who has a proposition for him, they are going to steal some money and become wealthy. He can leave his wife and job and run off with the secretary. Sounds too good to be true.As usual, things don't go to plan and Macdonald briskly tells us what happens when there is greed involved in ones life.The book is solid, very much like some written by Jim Thompson and David Goodis (which is a good thing), maybe a smidgen too brisk as developments take a life of their own as the 160 pages unfold."
5,Tocar Y Luchar,I am a music teacher at San Francisco Public elementary schools.This film is very inspiring to me.
3,????,I cannot really review this product because after purchasing it I was not able to find any of the tips to go with it anywhere!!! It has never been used.
5,Beautiful Photographs in a Beautiful Book,"Very classy, clean, elegant, refined photographs. Presented beautifully. A great photo book to own if you like more classic photography."
4,A contemporary American tragedy that draws you in.,"McTeague is a tragedy, though not quite on par with the Greek and Shakespearean tragedies, is certainly worthy of praise. The author does a splendid job of vibrantly describing settings and characters. The characters are ones that you feel for and sympathize with as they all have their own tragic situations. Norris takes you through a rollercoaster as the characters in the book each have their highs and lows. Ultimately, McTeague, is more than just a story about mid-19th century California, but rather of the darker side of man himself. The evil qualities of man, such as lust and greed, are depicted in the book as well as the consequences of such qualities. Although McTeague starts of slowly at first, the novel sucks you in quickly and doesn't let go."
4,A novel portraying the ups and downs of living in the city,"McTeague does an excellent job of showing, with detailed description, the cyclical paths that life takes us through. The greedy characters find themselves in good fortunes one day, and down on their luck the next. As Nature chooses how McTeague will live his life, McTeague finds that he has no control over his destiny. Readers will discover how weak humans, even the strongest of men, are when standing toe to toe with the might of Nature, who conquers all."
4,a book of wonder,This novel was really a thought-provoking book. A stirring example of Naturalism. It had a very realistic portrayal of the rise and fall of a simple-minded dentist and his frugal wife. The characters were very realistic and they didn't live a storybook life. I enjoyed the novel a lot.
3,Bleakest view of human life,"I read McTeague because I enjoyed Frank Norris's other novels and his naturalistic, intense writing style. But there's no protagonist in this story. It spirals down into deepening depravity and the characters are so repulsive that I finished it feeling sick and sullied. I readily recommned Norris's other stories, but McTeague is too bleak and horrid. BUT, I'd be surprised if any modern reader did not have their vocabulary expanded from reading Norris. The diction is delightful!"
4,A Tragic Story,"Even though the story would become slow with so much detailed description of the characters' surroundings, I could not put it down because the characters were so well written and alive. This was a great book about greed. Mr. Norris has a unique style that I enjoyed."
2,Misspellings,"I had read this book some 40 years ago when I was in college. For someone who lives in San Francisco and loves history, McTeague is especially good reading. I was disappointed to have received this particular printing of the book, when the cover had San Francisco misspelled. It wasn't misspelled elsewhere in the book. It was to be a gift but my friend said she didn't want to read it because of the error on the cover."
2,"A predictable, naturalistic novel.","This book was very repetitive and predictable that it seemed to continue forever. I would not have finished the book except I was forced to take reading quizzes everyday in AP English. It was evident from the description of McTeague in the first few chapters that he was going to murder someone with his enormous strength. I was relieved when he finally met Marcus in the middle of the desert because it was obvious two hundred pages earlier that McTeague was going to kill him, and as soon as they met in Death Valley I knew the book was finally over"
2,Tea: I think the few sips I've had are enough,"Overall, I bought this book from a recommendation from another author, and because its allegedly a ""classic"".I started reading the story, about a dentist practicing in San Francisco, California in the late 1800's. I found myself completely at a loss as to what the purpose of the story was, added to a complete disconnection or interest in the main character. I plain, just didn't get it, not in any way, shape or form.I was looking forward to reading this book because I thought it would be really good, an enjoyable read. It was a major let down, for me, and so bad I couldn't finish the book after about forty pages.Maybe if I had been alive in 1899, I would have loved it?"
5,A must read,I agree with the reviewers below. This is a superb read that with stay with you for a long time. I read it on my own as an adult but agree it should be part of a classic literature curriculum.
4,A commentary on Greed,"Mcteague, a novel by Frank Norris, is a book which shows how greed can destroy a person's life. Hardworking Mcteague suddenly comes into som money when his wife wins the lottery. He thiks this is cause to celebrate, but he doesn't know how wrong he is. Soon, his best friend turns on him when he feels he has a legitimate claim to the money. A man named Zerkow is driven to murder when he finds that his wife may be withholding very value pottery from him. Almost everybody in the book is devastated in one way or another from their greed. This book is an excellent satire of the evils of greed."
5,A Thoughtful Overture to Art for Thoughtful Parents,"Lucy Micklethwait will hopefully add more books to this concept. A whole series of subjects that introduce young eyes to the art world is much needed and Micklethwait seems to be the one to prepare it.In this small but stunning book the child's eyes are trained to look for color, learn to identify color related to natural forms as depicted by artists, both from the school of the masters to contemporary practitioners, and react! The results are not only beneficial to the child: reading and viewing this book is bound to sharpen the eye and the knowledge of the parent or friend sharing the experience.If there is to be a future for art, artists, and museums, in this era of cutbacks in art teaching from the school curriculum, then books such as this sensitive one will help save the day. Recommended for eyes of every age! Grady Harp, December 05"
2,"Look great, don't last long","I was thrilled when I got these because the lights and colors on them looked great and I've always had success with the Skechers brand. However after less than a month the velcro closure strap on both shoes tore quite a bit, to the point where I thought each time my son put on these shoes would be the last. If I had to do it over again I'd still go with Skechers but probably a different type."
5,a good book,I liked this book it really kept me on the edge. I recommend this book to anyone who can read
4,Chihuaha Bag,"I bought this bag for my daughter as a ""thank-you"" gift for her help in a major task I'm undertaking.I recently visited her and she was using the bag. I was surprised at how durable and sturdy it is...not to mention sooooooooo durn cute!"
1,Worst version ever!,"This is a very classical book on the subject of fluid mechanics, and I was very happy to find a hardcover version. But this version is a big disappointment! Obviously this is a copy of a library book with the call number, the name of the library and other people's writing in it. The worst things are: it is not complete, and it is so blurring that I was not able to read it at all! I found a printing statement in the book saying that this is ""due to the very old age and scarcity of this book"". I really think Amazon should put this statement in the description of this book! Too bad that I eagerly put my name in the first page, otherwise I definitely will return it."
5,Everything I Expected and Then Some,"Received the drive in a timely manner with new Amazon Prime. Purchased PATA drive to go inside (Western Digital 250 Gb). Setup of hardware and drive was very easy. Instructions proviced by Apricorn were very good. Enclosure+Drive is very quiet and fast. Software enclosed w/ Apricorn enclosure for imaging, cloning, backing up, and encrypting is very easy to use. I would recommend this enclosure to anyone looking for one. The version with firewire may be better for some if the greater availability of USB is not important."
3,Be careful - check the specs,"First of all, the 3 stars has nothing to do with the quality of the product, it is all about the lack of quality of the description and documentation. If the drive that you intend to put in here is SATA, DO NOT buy this! This model is ONLY for the old style PATA interface drives. Nowhere in Amazon's description does it say that. If you have a SATA drive (as opposed to a SATA interface, which is how the case plugs into the computer), you need model DTS. Unfortunately I needed this quickly due to a backup failure, so I returned this and bought another brand at Fry's. There is a handy chart on the back of the box that tells you which model you need, but unfortunately you have to buy the case to see it...Good Luck!"
3,"Cools well, but HD ""clicky"" also potential PS issue",I bought one of these recently. It keeps the hard drive cool with excellent ventilation! The cooling fan is very quiet. However you will hear hard drive clicking sounds during any kind of disk activity since the body of the hard drive is tightly coupled to the aluminum housing. I had a potential power supply issue when I used this enclosure with a WD3200JB Western Digital 320GB disk. After installing the drive I encountered periodic very loud clicking sounds (i.e. not like data access) from the drive after which data activity would cease for a period of 5 seconds or so. Some disks do this when the power supply is inadequate. I opted to get a replacement power supply for the unit after which I was able to use the enclosure with a WD1600JB 160GB drive with no problems. (The WD3200JB worked fine inside my computer).
4,Rocking Hard,"After the quiet, folky sounds of Big Daddy, John Mellencamp(now dropping the Cougar from his name), came back hard with WheneverWe Wanted To. On this album he combines the hard rock edge ofAmerican Fool with the socially relevant lyrics of his mid-80'salbums. ""Get A Leg Up"" is a hard rocker that is a distantcousin to ""Hurts So Good"". ""Love &Happiness"", ""Crazy Ones"", ""Melting Pot"" andthe title track are all excellent songs. ""Again Tonight""was a single, but it doesn't work well in the album as it sounds likeit was stuck in as an afterthought. The bonus track is a remix of ""Love And Happiness"" that doesn't really click."
5,REAL ROCK!!!,ITS GOOD TO HERE SOMETHING NEW. THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OLD. THIS IS REAL ROCK . NOT THE SCREAMING HEAD BANG STUFF. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS C.D. FOR A OVER YEAR. THANKS AMAZON!!!
4,Return to Rock,"A lot of people breathed a sigh of relief when they heard this album, which was a return (musically) to Mellencamp's hard rock sound after the more acoustic, folksy strains of ""The Lonesome Jubilee"" and ""Big Daddy"". To John's credit, though, he didn't let up a bit on exposing painful truths in the lyrics of these songs. Case in point, from ""Love and Happiness"", wherein John sums up life in America in 1991: ""So if you sell arms or you run dope, you've got respect and you've got hope. Let the rest of us die on the battlefields, with wounds that fester and wounds that never heal."" Truer words were seldom spoken! John admits to some of his own frailties in ""Now More Than Ever"", and just sings about plain old good times in ""Again Tonight"". Finally, ""Get a Leg Up"" is raunchy, down-and-dirty fun. Thoroughly enjoyable!"
4,Excellent remastering,"The remastering adds welcome depth to the sound, which on the original release was a bit harsh."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Naturally if you are a DMB fan, you would definitely want this video/dvd. Don't buy it. Looks cool, especially ""40 minutes of exclusive interviews"". Unfortunately all with a bunch of so called friends of Dave Matthews who give their ""insight"" on the band. And absolutely no DMB music. Right when you open the DVD, it says it ""Not authorised by Dave Matthews Band"". And ""authorised"" is spelled that way. This looks like a bootleg DVD you would buy from a swap meet, and I am angry that Big Name chain stores would be selling this. It's very misleading."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"Horrible!! My wife and I are big DMB fans. We were excited to see what this DVD had to offer, and considering that we saw this at Hastings, we figured it would be alright. Wrong!!As stated by a previous reviewer, you get less than a minute of Dave actually talking. The rest are either friends and no-names who you don't really give a damn about. The least they could have done was interviewed Tim Reynolds.I think the best way to describe this production is to that of the Blair Witch Project. Low-Budget, Amateurish, Garbage. Not too mention there's not one micro-second of DMB music on this DVD.I'll be visting Hastings tonight, reciept in hand, to get my money back on this disaster."
1,"""Unauthorized"" by DMB for good reason","As far as I can tell, this was a shameless attempt by someone to make $$ off of DMB. As other reviewers stated, there isn't a single note of DMB music on this DVD. That in itself is reason to leave it on the shelf."
3,"Not their best, but still good","3 1/2 stars...Ok, so this was definately not their best. I really don't recommend buying it either, unless you are totally bored with your DMB selection, but even then, try to burrow it from someone you know or rent it from the library or a video store.Do not waste your money on this one, only because there are a lot of better DMB DVD's out there to spend your ""dinero"" on!Buyer Beware."
1,There's no WHAT?,"There is not a single note of music played by the Dave Matthews Band any place on this VHS. That said, you may draw your own conclusions about how BAD this video could possibly be."
4,"Smart and stylish, but missing one thing...","These brackets look great and fit so well with the Sony speakers that you'd think they were part of the speaker once assembled, but I must admit I was a bit disappointed that they don't come with any screws to mount them to the wall nor do the instructions give info on the correct size.I had to go out to a hardward store with the bracket in hand and literally try different sizes until I found the right ones. The head of the screws have to be flat underneath, not angled or the brackets may ""rock"" slightly on the wall. (Round head, steel, size 8x1 wood screws work nicely I found out.)"
3,I haven't used this product in several years. I am now using a Canon product.,"I am not using this product any more. When I did, it was good and I successfully refilled and used refilled cartridges. This made the product more affordable. When I bought a new computer, it was bundled with a Cannon scanner, printer, so I now have no use for the HP products."
4,Works as expected,"Needed this for a fax machine. It's hard to find in stores, so needed to resort to online purchasing. Works fine."
5,HP20 Black ink Cartridge,Nothing difference with purchased from retail store except 25% cheaper and saved me a trip to Office Depot.
5,Great Find!,"The big chain stopped carrying cartridges for this printer model, so I thought I was going to have to resort to buying a new printer. Very fortunately, I was able to locate these print cartridges at a very reasonable price. They are not refills (something that made me even more happy)!"
4,lovely sounds,"lovely sounds for lovely people. pleasant and warming: friendly electric music that is good for listening to in many different situations. if you like music, especially electric music, try this. if you like the postal service or any band that sounds like the postal service, try this (unless you find vocal-free music horrible, because there are no words in any of these songs). if you like beeping, you'll like this album because there are some fine beeps. Good job Proud Robot!"
5,"Psychological Therapy for the ""Postal"" in all of us!","As a combat veteran that has served this country honorably,just to watch the ""senate"" and the congresscritters wipe their poopy butts with the constitutionthat I hold dear, is almost unbearable.Clair Wolfe in my opinion, has supported and defended the constitution as well as any soldier.Her words will be shrined in the same reverence that I hold the words of Ben Franklin, Patrick Henry,or Nathan Hale.As for the ignorant reviews (1-2 stars) I have seen here, they are unfounded in logic or fact.""Those wo would surrender essential liberty for a little temporary safety,deserve neither liberty nor safety"" -Benjamin FranklinThe Tree of Liberty is dry...Time to water."
3,I was dissappointed,"I would only recommend this book to libertarian leaning folks who are not on the net. As a hardcore libertarian, I was ammused with her first 101 suggestions. This book, her second, was really just more of the same. Alot has been written about CW since her first book, and her loyalties have been questioned deeply. She uses several ""sources"" which are the very people she warns against allying with (a collection of known snitches, provacateurs, and feds). The book also had nothing to offer a veteran net-reader who is a libertarian. It came across as a mere collection of stuff that is already out and old for netizens. If you really want to send more money than it is worth to the author, make sure and give it to some computer illiterate who is not really into Freedom yet. I also have a bias against the very premise of the book--I believe it _is_ Time To Shoot The Bastards: NOW."

2,Swatch the Mac of the watch world,I loved this watch for as long as it lasted - the time started going wacky at 11 months despite the fact that new battery was installed. Three months later when the watch was just over a year old the strap went to jelly and the now it's just one long slit so there is nothing for the catch to hold on to so the watch is useless. I'd stick with Swatch if they replaced their watch straps - stupid money-making greedy pigs - too bad.
5,Simple without being simplistic,"The pictures are simple. The words are simple. On the surface, the plot is, too. Still, McPhail includes an important lesson in team work, helping others and handling difficult situations.On opposite sides of a stream, Jack the rabbit and Rick the bear want to play together. Jack has a log on his side of the stream, Rick a jump rope. Jack and Rick work together to overcome obstacles to get on the same side of the stream.The story is nicely done in a simple first reader. It tells an interesting tale in words an early reader can handle. It's a great combination. It's even one that my 2 1/2 year-old enjoys having read to him. All in all, the book is well done."
2,Mandatory Commercials Included!,"Warning: this release by Paramount includes mandatory commercials. You must view these each time the DVD begins. Plan on putting together a lunch while waiting for the Cheers area of the DVD. Otherwise, we found this Cheers release to be enjoyable, as were the original shows. Thumbs down Paramount, unless you wish to reduce the price of the DVD."
5,Cheers comments,I have every season of Cheers and this season is as good as any of them.Would highly recommend to others.
5,Works fine,Works fine. Phone charges quickly with the product and the chord stretch makes using the phone while charging no problem. (Drive Safely!)
5,Much needed approach . . .,"I am a clinical counselor with 27 years experience and I recommend this book pretty consistently in my work with both birth mothers and adoptive children. The spirit and tone of both the drawings and wording seems to impact them in just the right way to bring about some new clarification and healing. I believe that the book gives a message that goodness can be found in almost all situations/people if that is what we are tuned to look for. The basic principle of reframing (looking for the noble intention in a behavior)is espoused in the message of the book, and that is something that is often very helpful and healing. I know that some local adoption agencies and adoption specialists are using the book and are very pleased with the impact on their clients. A gem of a book. . . lots of heart in this one."
2,great concept but not necessarily appicable for all situations,"The overall concept of this book is excellent, however, there's one or two pages that are too specific and make it not necessarily the perfect book for everyone. I purchased based on several rave reviews.The overall concept is that the bio mom does love her child and always will. For the bio moms of our 2 children, this is absolutely appropriate and applicable - the reason my children are mine thru adoption is BECAUSE their bio moms loved them, despite their inability to properly care for them. However, there's a page that states how the bio mom ate right and avoided medicine as soon as she knew she was pregnant. My children were adopted via children & youth - their mom's did not eat right and avoid ""medicine"" if you know what I mean. I kept the book because the overall concept - that my children are loved not only by me, but by their bio mom too, is the message to take home."
4,"As an Adoptive Mom, I Love It!","Our son was adopted, and we bought a copy for him and for his birthmom. We knew her and found many of the same traits in her that are in Annie (the birthmom in the book). It does portray a very idealistic situation, but the point of the book is that adoption is a very loving decision.In this day and age, when abortion and single teen parenting are more socially acceptable than adoption, I am very happy to see books that promote this choice, which blesses the lives of everyone involved."
5,Tarkovsky,It's a grreat book with a lot of useful information for any Tarkovsky scholar. So basically I think that this book is fabulous and that I think that AT is highly underrated.Jim
2,Fantasy,"Frequently felt over the top. Did not feel real. See Mike Curtis ""CQB"" for someone who was actually there."
4,Another good book by David Poyer,"Although my favorite book of the series is China Sea, I nevertheless enjoyed this book as well. I wish though that David Poyer would please let his character make full Commander --doesn't he think Dan has earned it? I Look forward to the next installment!"
2,Workmanlike,"A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts."
5,A excellent introduction to EM Waves,"This is a excellent text for undergraduates in physics or EE to understand the fundamental electromagnetic properties of vibrations, waves and radiation. It supplements Purcell's very well. Having studied it, you are equipped with solid understanding and can go on into Optics."
3,poor quality and Boris only a small part...not the star,"The original quality of the movie is often washed out in details in faces...and uneven exposure. The music was exsessivly upbeat for no reason in the first part of the movie but settled down somewhat afterwards.It took a bit to figure out if this was a comedy or a serious movie. the Captions were humorous and the pratfalls and such soon suggested a farcical movie. A boxing movie... not my favorite type. And Boris Karloff had little more than a bit part... and not typical Boris fare at that. Still any silent movie I'm glad to have, though this one was only fair. Entertaining enough but not brilliant on any level. pretty much average fair and any new person to the silent movie genre would probably not want to see too many more after seeing this one first. Though 1924, the quality of the original movie appears to vastly inferior to the date."
1,dynamite dan,The quality of the picture is very poor. it's like a home made copy of an old vhs tape or wrost. out of minumun standards of quality. don't buy it!!!!!!
4,OK so I didn't buy this brand but....,I went to my local Apple store in the mall and bought the iSkin (there is a website...bet you can't guess what it is. ;-)) that is made by EVO2. This product works great and it comes with its own screen protector. So you won't have to Mcguyver one out of a PDA screen protector. It also comes with a belt clip that is a total waste of time. I am very happy that my iPod is well protected with this rubbery iCondom!!
2,Tasty but questionable results,"The results of increased energy were not noticeable to me so I wouldn't purchase this product again, but it did have a nice fruity sweet taste."
3,Sent it back for powder,"I am sure it's a perfectly fine product but I ordered the wrong type of product, chewables instead of powder."
3,Unsure,"First time I took it I had an incredible night playing volleyball. I was getting up high and spiking hte ball hard which is not typical. However, playing after that time whether I took it or not, did not seem to make much difference. I a still hitting good, but that seems to be due to having played in thick sand and then playing on a harder surface."
1,Dr. Oz reccomended this flop,"I rarely watch Dr. Oz, and have never followed his advice until the show about ""Super remedies"" (or what every it was called). Dr. Oz had this product as one of his ""Super"" energy helpers. Supposedly helps increase your energy. The chewables taste good, but don't help with energy. I tried a couple the Dr. Oz's recommendations from that show and found neither did what he said."
4,may work for you,"Dr. Weil has about as good a summary as any you will find on this partially researched substance. Google Dr. Weil dot com and then d-riboseSafe, some research that supports it, and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that should not be dismissed.These are handy orange flavored tablets 1.5 grams each. Usual recommended dose is 10-15 grams/day in 2-3 doses. But maybe less if less works for you.They taste ok - not great and not bad. Do they work? Depends on your body, apparently. I just started taking them for energy. So, it may take a few days to a month to work, from what I have read."
2,Too Much Glue !!!!,"The cd's come with a beautiful book. Unfortunately, the glue from the book's disc sleeves was all over my cd's! It was rather disappointing having to clean all the glue off of brand new cd's. Especially when you consider that this is supposed to be a premium product. I still haven't got all the glue off.If it weren't for that, I probably would have rated it 4 stars."
1,Bypass this set - go for the JSP box set instead...,"Columbia missed a trick with this one. Although they succeeded in removing most of the snap and crackle of the original 78s, the resulting sound quality is flat and lifeless. I suppose Columbia was aiming this product at a general listening audience as opposed to a dedicated afficionado of oldie jazz. Perhaps Columbia reasoned that the average listener would find the surface noise distracting. But this music should sound better than it does in Columbia's presentation of it. Yes it sounds clean, but it also sounds dull. There's no bloom on the trumpet tone!JSP's (much cheaper) issue of this wonderful music is also available on Amazon. The powerful sound of Louis's trumpet comes through much better on their box set."
3,"Killer music, terrible packaging","I was so excited to get this set. Upon opening it one disc fell on the floor, one other was scratched due to the hard card board sleeving, and the other two discs had glue all over them. After a half hour or so of working them to a state I could play them, I was too disappointed to enjoy the set. The book is great as is the music even if it is a bit thin; however, this is some of the worst packaging I have ever seen. I plan to return it and search for the JSP set others have recommended. Shame on Columbia for employing such incompetent packaging engineers. The great Louis Armsrting deserves more attention to detail."
3,Pretty Entertaining,"I thought this book was light of content, making it easy to read, enjoyable, amusing and fun. The story is based around a simple misunderstanding that escalates to huge proportions. A fun book for most any age."
5,Fantastic Book,"Like the Circus, this book is excellent for ""Children of All Ages.""Best enjoyed when one person reads it aloud to a group."
5,The best book on NDE!,"I've read several near death experience books, but this one was by far the best. I found it very touching, moving and life changing. Very descriptive and detailed. I loved it!"
1,Do not buy this book!,"The book is overwhelmed with Ned's life. There isn't much NDE description in the book. Ned simply describes the scenes but the emotion and feelings involved weren't well described, which are very important in most NDE stories. I skipped many pages in this book because I am sick of his story on his own stuff. The ""ending"" of the book is also too dramatic which makes me doubting the book. In conclusion, this book tells you nothing new you would read from other better NDE books. Unless you really have the spare money, don't buy this book. Forget about the vision on 911, he DID NOT see it."
2,Awful!,I couldn't wear these even when I was 23 weeks pregnant! I was so happy to get pantyhose that could go over my belly... but these were too tight and an extremely ugly color... I would recommend thigh highs when you're pregnant!
4,Monster Cable,"Godd product; was really for autombile installation, but worked fine in my home audio system,"
1,Just don't bother with this one.,"This movie is a cheesy version of an old slasher movie with no real twists, fairly predictable. Several students at a well to do private academy hear of a local murder and decide to invent a murderer for their school paper. Then all of a sudden, the murders start coming true. I got sick of this movie about 10 minutes into it with all of the IM and Text messaging that was occuring....ooo so spooky. Just not like how they used to make slasher films. Don't bother renting this, and I'm sorry if you saw this in the theaters."
3,"worth a rental, but nothing special","Its an average movie. its not too bad, but its not ""knock your socks off"" good either. It will not impress too many die hard horror movie fan, not too much gore here, but it at least keeps your interest. It also has a decent plot, good acting, and the dvd is pretty good quality. Since we are on the subject of ""wolf"" titled movies, I would go see wolf creek!"
5,"Who cares if there's no gore?...if that's all you watch for, you're pathetic","I was completely stunned at the outcome of this movie, but I was satisfied that it wasn't just another cheesy ending. After reading some of these reviews I myself questioned having picked this movie up. But when it all fizzled out to reveal the truth, I was shocked. Not only was it satisfying, it was completely and thoroughly unsuspected. This is a great movie, and if you can stand to watch a horror movie without severed body parts everywhere, then you may be able to enjoy this. I never really cared to look into this until I watched Adema's video for ""Planets."" When I saw this, I figured, if the story in any way relates to the lyrics of this song, it must be half-decent...and it was. While I know alot of people will crucify my review, I half to put it up here, I can't let one good review for a GOOD movie be drowned out by so many bad reviews...Forget gore..grow up, and pay attention to the story"
2,So Many Instant Messages. So little time.,"For a horror movie, this was not actually a good one. It does have a twist ending, but the tagline well tell you it all. A group of students at Westlake Prepschool loves to lie to people, and they make a little game out of it. When the students hear about a girl getting murdered in the nearby woods, they make a game out of it, convincing that their is a serial killer is on the loose.Not much gore, but blood, but not much blood. The thing that annoyed me about this film was the use of technology. All of the friends, room mates, killer, teachers, use instant messagine, and that's how they all die. A girl runs in the woods, and hides - she gets dialed by the killer, and she gets screwed as a bullet gets shot into her head. Real smart, she could've called the police.This movie has a body count of 2, people dying with a bullet. The ending was stupid, but smart in a lie-lie way. Movie is okay, could've been better. There will be an unrated cut (I geuss?!)"
2,What is this movie about?,"I watched this movie for one reason. Jared Padalecki. He's probably about the only good thing in this movie. I've watched this movie twice, once with the commentary and I still have no clue what it's about. It's another one of those 'stupid people doing stupid things for stupid reasons' slasher movies that seem so popular. I felt sorry for Gary Cole. Was he really that hard up for work to appear in this movie? And it took me most of the movie to realize Jon Bon Jovi was in it.Save your money. If you're a Jared Padalecki fan, it's nice to have for your collection and at least he doesn't die in this one."
1,B-Movie Bad!,"The trailers for this advertised a completely different movie...this was one of the most stupid things i have ever seen! What was Jared Padelecki of Supernatural thinking?? He's great on that show, but he had not much screen time here, probably for the best. You could have blinked and missed him if the rest of the cast hadn't given me a headache. This is another low budget teen ""horror"" that turns out to be nothing at all - i'm so sick of made-up horror movies! Did i mention ""professor bon jovi""?? ahhh!!!"
2,ANOTHER PG-13 ''HORROR'' MOVIE?!?!,WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!catering to kids is killing the horror genre!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!but hollywood will make us pay for the better ''unrated'' version dvd in a few months!!!!!!!!!!!please form a single line
1,Garbage,"this was terrible. I'm not going to give away the end, but it was IDIOTIC. I wasted my money."
1,Blu ray,"Item not shipped from a us company, not compatible with blu ray players in the us, so not able to view thought I purchased from business in us"
4,"dont listen to the haters, this was a great movie! Clever!","Im a movie freak and i must say i love this film, my problem with movies is i usually love it up until the end... but this movie delivers and has a great suspensful ending!"
2,"DONT BOTHER , BORING!!","This is defiantly is not horror movie AT ALL!!! Mystery/thriller category more like it for sure...just bunch a teens with crappie acting...I guess only company got some money from this flick is cell phones and AOL instant messenger. Looks like was a AD for those companies..Lame and silly. . This remind me the movie made in 80S call ""April fool's day"", Such as this is remake from that movie look like!April fool's day was soo much superior and scarier to this junk!! This one Just throw some computer and cell phones into this crap and made it silly and stupid & not scary!!.... If u wants to really see a nice scary movie in this type scrip and gender? Then try ""APRIL FOOL'S DAY"" & something newer call ""Identity (2003)"" or""DEAD MAN'S CURVE"" these few titles is superior and much scarier and better scrip to this B.S!!! C"
2,Seriously....,"This has got to be one of the most dissapointing movies that I have seen in some time...yes I have seen some bad ones this year, but I am so dissapointed because due to some of the reviews that I had read on here prior to watching this movie, made the film out to have some promise of a good mystery...well, this is not the case with this one...first 45 minutes or so, was so boring, I was falling alseep...only after this time, did it start to pick up...confusing, boring, lacked luster in my opinion. Not one of my favorites, skip over this low budget ""wanna be"" horror/ mystery movie."
1,yawn,"this is the lamer version of the 80's piece of garbage,aptly titled,April Fools Day.no other decade had so much fun with holidays.anyway,this wasnt scary nor spine tingling.it was snore enducing.thats what i get for giving into cool posters........pg-13 strikes again!"
1,how stupid do you all feel ?!?!?!?!?!?,"OBVIOUSLY the LAME @SSED PG-13 version was NOT the one the studio wanted to release.but in its greedy attempt to grab as much 13 y/o cash,why not.also,knowing that they can release a $20+ dvd version of what SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE THEATERS doesnt hurt.stevie wonder saw this coming.if you want a better telling of this piece of crap,rent that 80's piece of crap ''Aprils Fools Day''...........the title says it all.anyone who spends 1 penny on a pg-13 HORROR/THRILLER movie qualifies for fool of the year award."
1,SUCKS!,"don't be fooled this is not a slasher flick it's not like SCREAM i was fooled, the cover may be appealing but it really does suck. The plot is just plain stupid, no kill scenes, not a horror movie more like a suspense.I saw the theatrical trailer in the theaters and you may think its a slasher but it's not. If you like slashers this is not one. DO NOT BUY!"
1,What a way to waste an afternoon,"Just came back from seeing ""Cry Wolf"", what a huge waste of time that was! Midway thru the movie I was thinking that if I had rented this thing I would have been stopping it and watching something else. Jon Bon Jovi is in this mess, and that's about the most interesting thing this has going for it. His acting leaves much to be desired however. The acting of the main cast members is pathetic as well. The greatest moment though comes at the end when Gary Cole speaks using a VERY poor English accent, it's quite laughable. Oh, the plot of the movie. These spoiled rich high school kids decide to create a murderer on campus story to scare the other students. Surprise! Killings begin afterwards. The end of the movie wraps up like a Scooby Doo mystery but is far less interesting. Just a huge waste of time. Save your money!!"
4,"Not Just A ""Slasher"" Flick","Don't cliche this movie as a slasher flick. It's more of a psychological thriller. It is definately worth seeing at least once. There are so many twists and turns and it has a great ending as well. You won't be dissappointed. See ""Cry_Wolf""!"
2,the ending made most of it pointless,"when i watched it...the film felt like it was a mystery trying to be a horror. throughout the movie the students shifted blame and kept asking who...the ending of the film is horrible. the ending made the rest of the film rather pointless considering the identity of the ""killer"" and the motive behind it was rather insulting to the viewer. on a side note the acting wasn't that great either. the main female with the red hair was very annoying and her acting seemed stiff."
3,An average horror flick,"Surpirisingly, not a bad movie if you can look past the mediocre acting. It seems to follow the same formula as most horror movies until a surprise twist at the end which will satisfy most horror fans.I actually found it quite entertatining and would rate it above average, on the same par as Urban Legend."
4,Ain't no horror/slasher film!!,"Making this look like a horror/slasher film was a ridiculous marketing decision. It is not. It is a who-done it, probably of most interest to young people, but it can be enjoyed by anyone who likes to try to follow complex who done its. I thought it was surprisingly good. It was pretty complex and not surprisingly there are a few loose ends. Yet it does keep you guessing. I guessed the end pretty much but could not be absolutely sure until the last minute. Acting quite decent and some nice photography and interesting scenes. dialogue often intelligent and interesting.Good entertainment if you don't go in with false expectations. Not Citizen Kane or Lawrence of Arabia."
3,Slightly clever but definitely not for me.,If you like twists and turns in a movie even if they are totally unrealistic and you are a teenager then you might like this thriller mystery.
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"Admittedly, after reading so many horrible reviews for Cry Wolf, I was expecting to be disappointed. However, that was not the case. Oh sure, this movie will appeal to bubble gum popping teeny boppers but I think the plot had something going for it.I would have preferred if the kids were in college instead of high school but I guess it lends a more sinister tone to the end using high school kids.I wouldn't buy this movie but I'd say it's worth a rental."
3,Wasn't really a horror,Wasn't really a horror movie but more like a guessing game movieit could have been better but it wasn't the worst movie ever what can i say not every movie can be the prefect movie...
2,Spoiler Review,"I went to go see this movie with some friends because we all thought the previews looked really good. This movie kept me somewhat interested but by the end it really screwed up.Basically a jealous girl wants to seek revenge and kill her lover (which is her professor, ew). So, she sets up this one guy into thinking all these people are getting killed... and you think and hope so too. But no, they aren't. In the end it explains how it was ALL fake... how crappy! And what a dissapointment...If you're wanting to see a ""slasher-horror movie"", this is not it! I think it would have been better if they all died."
1,cryed at the end,this movie sucks really bad watch if you dare i found myself banging my head aganist the wall i watch days or are lives with my girlfriend and they had a killer marlena they killed but really didnt kill watch it for yourself lame really bad should not have put this out
3,Cry Wolf: not as scary as i'd hoped!,"This movie starts with a girl getting shot.Some students in residents make up a rumor that the killer who murdered that girl is someone on campus. When a real killer strikes the campus, no one believes.The ending will shock you, as it did me. I thought it was going to be scarier than it actually was. The real killer ends up being a couple of pranksters, but there really is a killer on campus. The murderer ends up being someone you'd least expect.Watch Cry Wolf and find out!"
4,better than you think,"I watch horror movies almost exclusively, including the very VERY overused slasher genre... but I must admit, this one surprised me. Written pretty well and the acting was decent. Worth a look."
5,Powerful,"I passed this book up for a couple of years because it looked like it was for teenagers and then for awhile longer because I thought it sounded so depressing...Then a woman I know read an excerpt from it at a bible study I attended. Within a week I had bought a copy and found out that it wasn't only suprisingly uplifting, but that it was simply a feast of faith. No other book outside of scripture has spurred me on in my faith the way this one has.It really brought Hebrews 12:1 to life for me in a precious way. ""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.""I strongly encourage anyone who isn't sure about it, to just go for it. I can hardly imagine you regretting it."
2,this devies music catigories,The musicians and the songs beat most contemporary bands but I had to rate it an overall two stars due the electic clashing style.
1,This is not a book,This doesnt even look like what I ordered. I am very disappointed. It is only a 63 page miniature pamphlet. Dont waste ur money.
4,Small!,"This book was recomended to me by a friend who had read it before - and the price I thought was great, until I recieved it and realized it's no bigger than a pamphlet! Just a heads up!"
2,What on Earth Am I Here For?,"What on Earth Am I Here For? this is a BOOKLET so beware, here I thought I was getting the book as mentioned....very unhappy about the description put on Amazon books"
4,What on Earth Am I here For Book,"The book arrived on time and was packaged well. Bought Them for my church and will do it again. Hate the fact though that I could only order 3, foolishness Man Please do better than that!!"
3,What on Earth Am I Here For? Purpose Driven Live,"The book had a lot information on living life for God and having a purpose, I enjoyed reading it very much"
2,What on Earth Am I Here For? Purpose Driven Life,"This was probably one of the only times that I didn't read the reviews before I made a purchase ... must have been busy or distracted. Anyway, as I've since discovered from the reviews and from reading through this version, this is NOT the FULL book ... it is an abbreviated, pamphlet type version. 'Kind of disappointing. Oh well, that's a mistake I won't make again. The excerpt on the product page is almost as long as this book ... and pretty much sums up the entire pamphlet."
1,This is NOT the whole book,"I'm working through this book in hard copy, and I thought having an ebook version would be more convenient. I linked to this version from the product page of The Purpose Drive Life. I was disappointed to find that this is just a few chapters from the book. Save your dollar.If you want the whole book, you can find it on here for $6.99, but you'll have to dig around a little. Make sure you load up a sample and check the TOC before you buy."
2,I found the content dry,I got this book and it just has not been as motivating as I hoped. I have put it down a few times and have had a difficult time picking it back up -- it is just not as compelling as some of the other books of this style.
2,Dissappointed,"I was quite dissappointed with the ebook. I don't think the preview section provides accurate info on the contents of the book. I was expecting the book to provide at least a summary of the 40 day themes, but sad to say that it merely provides the first 7 themes. The purpose of purchasing this book was lost."
1,To my surprise,"I was surprised to find out it was a very small ""pocket sized"" book, really wanted a complete book. This one wasn't what I was looking for. I did find 3 more of the larger books for my friends since I already owned one of my own. Guess what, before I purchased the books I made sure of the page count before ordering them. Live and learn."
1,"This is a BOOKLET, not a book, otherwise it is good....","The way that Amazon describes this is as a BOOK, however, it is a booklet, very small, so I would NOT buy it at the same price again (way too much for a booklet) but I would spend up to a dollar on it.The booklet itself is really good and would be easy to hand out to anyone and would probably be a great way to introduce new Christians or the unsaved to the ideas of what our purpose in life really is.I was disappointed that Amazon touts this as a ""book"" though, so be forewarned."
1,...To Make Rick Warren Rich,"That's why the Purpose-Drivel Corporation continues to mass market just about everything imaginable. Unfortunately, people are blinded by thinking the Rick Warren really KNOWS why their on Earth. The answer is quite simple and you don't have to buy anything Purpose-Drivel merchandise - you're here because God wanted you here. Want to find out what God's real purpose is for you? Pray, read the Bible, and worship Him. If it is His will, you will find out when God is ready to let you know what His purpose is. This book is just another another way to not provide you with any real answers but to make a man rich by twisting God's word to earn money. Disgusting, really."
2,It's a pamphlet.,"Not to mention, I don't know what all the fuss was about. If you're a Christian, it isn't anything that you don't know already."
5,Thank God for this booklet,"This booklet is so great! It is a great way wet someone's whistle who otherwise would not read ""the Purpose Driven Life"". I have found that the two people who I've given this booklet now want to know more and have asked to read the actual book. It's concise enough to fit in pocket or purse and is great reading.I highly recommend giving this booklet to anyone to introduce the book and discover God's purpose for their life. It is a great ministry."
4,What on Earth am I here for?,"Comforting, positive message. It redirects your thoughts back to your faith and reminds a person that they are more than a single entity in the universe."
2,this is not the regular paperback but a pocket-size abridged version,I foolishly ordered this pocket-size abridged version of the book. Ugh. Beware if you buy this you know what you're getting.
2,This is not a book...,"The best I can say is that it is a tract...a rather long track. Rather sad that the author would call it a book, when it is clearly, at best, a booklet. It is a tract, intended, I think, for handing out to ""non-Christians."" Not at all what I was looking for."
4,Short Collection,"I like this CD because it has the major hits, however the songs that aren't hits are fillers, so it's good that the CD doesn't have more songs since it would mean more fillers. I have Business As Usual which have 3 or 4 of the songs in this CD, I also have Cargo on vinyl, so this Superhits CD doesn't add the the songs I already have. But it collects the hits in a short CD."
2,This is why I burn my own greatest hits CDs,"In addition to the other reviews that show what is missing from this set (and what should have been left out), I can't believe nobody has mentioned the lack of the awesome single (and video) ""High Wire"" (from Cargo), and the best song from 2 Hearts, ""Snakes and Ladders"". Many of these budget greatest hits collections purposely leave out a great song or two, so that the regular releases still sell."
1,"skip this and get ""The Essential Men at Work""","Men at Work only had five hits. ""Everything I Need"", included here, was not one. ""I Can See it in Your Eyes"", on the other hand, WAS one (perhaps the best) and is NOT included here. ""Blue for You"", also NOT included here, would have been a huge hit if the record company had been astute enough to release it as single."
1,What it could have been,This is my 2nd one of the kind. Both cracked when used to brew tea. I only assume it's not tempered for boiling water. What a shame.
1,Cant pour without dripping!,"I could not figure out how to pour from this without dripping. I just threw mine away since it would have cost almost the same amount to ship it back as the item itself, at least when it was $10 before."
3,Love the mixing stick but spills when poured,I really like this pitcher but have to be very careful when I pour it because it tends to run down the outside of the bottle and make a mess. Otherwise I have no complaint. I love that it has a mixer built in this has been great for homemade juices.
4,Good quality with three small flaws,"In general, I like this jug a lot. I like glass jugs that let me (and guests) easily see what's inside and how much is left. The jug is heavy, but not overly so. No complaints about the appearance. There are three small flaws with this jug.- Stirrer and lid are plastic. I've only used it for chilled beverage so far, so not a big issue, but would have been nice if everything is glass- Given the curvature of the jug, it's hard to pour out the last bits of liquid- A little hard to pour cleanly, without dripping liquid down the side of the sprout. Takes a little while to get used to it."
3,"Nice pitcher, useless insert","This ideal iced tea pitcher is attractive and nice quality but the ice insert disintegrated after the first use. Unlike the glass pitcher, the insert is made from the cheapest plastic, much like off-brand, dollar store plastic food storage containers that pretend to be permanent but are really more disposable."
2,Always drips!,Small capacity and drips no matter how pitcher is help. Acrylic insert takes up quite a bit of storage volume.
3,"Simple and useful, but needs a better lid",Why couldn't the lid simply turn to completely close? Then it would be a great product!
2,Drips all over the place,"We've been using this pitcher on a daily basis for the last year and while overall it works ok, it has one fatal flaw. We cannot pour a liquid out of it without dripping liquid all over the floor or counter. For every glass poured you have to get the kitchen towel or a paper towel. Regardless if it is me, my wife or my 12 y.o. son pouring, it always seems to drip and require cleanup.Also, the ice holder we got rid of into the recycling bin soon after getting the kit and the stirring stick broke in half after the first two months. Also because of the shape it is a little harder to clean too.A lass pitcher shouldn't be that difficult. It is a simple implement that you need to mix in, pour from and store in the fridge. So with all of these flaws, this things is going in to the recycle bin soon and be replaced."
4,Good Quality,"This is a descent container. We use it for ice tea. I'm not a fan of the plastic lid on there but it""s easily replaceable with a metal one from Teavana. The glass is thick, not thin like other containers we have. So I'm not worried if it taps the water faucet on accident. We don't use the ice holder but I'm sure it would work great if we did."
2,Nice Pitcher BUT,"The pitchers is glass and looks nice. It is of good quality and handles boiling water with no problem. I use it almost exclusively for making tea and it works OK. However, it doesn't pour well especially when it's full. Liquid runs under the lip and down the front of the pitcher. It's difficult to clean as you can't get your hand through the neck. The cap fits OK and the little stirrer stick works (have never found a use for this). The ice container that screws on to the inside of the lid deformed the first time it was used. It will still screw on but looks a bit like a lickerish stick. All in all, I wouldn't buy this again."
4,"Sturdy, well-made jug.","The glass in this jug is quite thick and the whole thing definitely has some heft to it. It's very pretty and easy to carry, pour out of, hold, transport, etc. I never feel like it's going to slip out of my hand or even break if I accidentally ding it against the side of a table or something. It feels like it would take a pretty big fall to really do damage to this thing.It's very easy to clean, the glass is attractive, and the shape is perfect for its usage. Even though some of the parts are plastic, I'd still recommend this jug to anyone. The jug itself is lovely, even if the plastic parts aren't."
3,Only complain is the packaging condition,"It's a nice product with very reasonable price. However, only complain is the packaging condition. When I received it, the Amazon package is very good. But when I opened it, the packaging of the jug is very duty and been opened already. The inside of jug is also full of dust. I wonder if it's a returned product by other customer?! After I washed, it is much ""newer"" which supposes to be.Anyway, if you consider to buy it for someone, better not...if it's only for your own use, nice product with nice price...because it's Bormioli Rocco!"
3,Ice container is plastic,"This would be a perfect product if only the lid was plastic. The inner ice tube is also plastic. The whole purpose, for me, of getting a glass pitcher was so that my drink would not be exposed to the plastic. 3 stars because they don't make it clear that the inner tube is plastic."
4,Very Nice Pitcher,"Like some of the other reviewers, I also thought the plastic lid just ""sat"" on top of the pitcher and when I poured from it, it just fell off. It really didn't make any sense to me, that a Bormioli Rocco product would provide such a cheap lid - so I tried pressing on the lid a bit harder than I had originally and it DOES snap on securely. But, because the lid does have a pouring hole, it's not going to be a solid seal. But it's good enough for my purposes.Secondly, the ice tube that comes with it is made of clear plastic. I wouldn't have a problem with that, except that plastic does not conduct cold like glass does, so I'm not sure that feature is worth making the purchase over.I doubt that I'll use that feature anyway.That said -- I love the pitcher. I just wanted a unique, sturdy glass pitcher to serve beverages from and this one is beautiful. Not something you'd see everyday. The glass is hefty, so it should give many years of service."
4,Convenient and perfectly sized,"I got this as a wedding present and I LOVE it. It's perfect for iced coffee, iced tea, or any other drink! It looks good when it is out on the table for guests to use. The only downside for me is that the inner ice tube is plastic. I haven't used that part at all because I'd rather not submerge plastic in my drinks. The stirrer is quite useful, as nothing else is thin enough or long enough to stir with.I highly recommend this product."
1,Broke before I even used it!!!,Flimsy!!! I put it in the sink & filled it with suds & it tipped ove & it just cracked!!! Glass very thin... Never got a chance to use it!!!
2,Gimmicky,"This was an impulse purchase. I needed a pitcher and was seduced by the built in tea maker, which takes up most of the carafe, leaving very little useful space. I would not buy again."
3,Ok way smaller than i expected...,It's cute. A little too pricey for a small glass jar. I got this for my party. Now...this is too small to hold enough liquid for a party more than 4.
2,Pass.,Simply not worth the price. Lid is ridiculous. Poor design all the way around. How hard is it to design a decent glass pitcher for tea these days?
5,Nice Pitcher! We use it for drink mixes.,I like having a BPA free pitcher. We use this for drink mixes like Crystal lite.
5,Perfect size -,Bought 3 of these pitchers to use for the new Crystal Lite Mocktails! It's the perfect size; snaps together easily; center with ice lasts a good long time - altho' the 'mocktails' don't last that long - we drink 'em! classy look for the patio :)
4,Glass pitcher with ice holding insert,"We love our Bormiolo Rocco Kufra jugs. For us the size is perfect for lots of drinks and especially for Bar drinks. With the insert, for incidence, Martinis stay cold without being watered down by melting ice. Also since the jug is glass it can be washed in the dishwasher. Do note the insert, top and stirrer are not glass. When Amazon sent the 3 jugs we bought, one was broken. We notified them and within 3 days we had the replacement and UPS picked up the damaged jug...all at no cost to us. We got great service."
3,okay,smaller than I thought and top is not completley closed so you get fridge orders in the pitcher
2,A Field Book of he Stars,I have been interested in Astronomy for a long time. This book is filled with great information regardingg the stars and different constellations. Unfortunately there are no plates or maps to go along with what is being said. With maps or plates of the different constellation would make the book a 4 or 5 rating on my list.
1,Don't bother for the Kindle,"I've seen this book in print and it is great. On the Kindle, it's worthless. They give it away for free and believe me, in this case, you get what you pay for."
2,No diagrams make this a dull read.,"This book is rather short but its price was free. However, it lacks a great amount of information to make it useful in my opinion. Certain references to what the ancient people considered about the stars lacked any collaborating evidence. And the author would put the most complex of these comments in a single small sentence. This made it a hard read for me.I question the value of this book for star study. If you want a history 'field guide' then expect this to be rather small with the most obvious of constellations mentioned in a mix of mysticism and potentially dated facts."
5,A worthwhile CD,"If this music is ""your genre,"" then this CD is a great addition to your collection. Good sound quality and good songs representing some of the better pop songs of the 50's."
1,A terrible product,"Wow, should have read the Amazon reviews before buying. I signed up to write a review with Amazon just because this product has caused me so much frustration. I have had a compact Optoma project that has been wonderful for the past four years. I bought this because it was even smaller. What a contrast! The projector failed the first day. Received a message saying ""Lamp Did Not Strike"" ?? After following directions and checking the lamp door and reseating the lamp, same message. This is my third time trying to get through to customer service. The first two times I was on hold for an hour before having to leave. So far it's been 45 minutes...(I'm never buying Infocus again. Back to Optoma...)"
1,What a tease,"You really want to love this projector. I bought three! Clients ooh and aah over the sleek size and of course it is easy to carry. Thats where the fun ends. Two of the three have broken down in moderate use within 6 months. The first has been under repair for 10 weeks and there is always something ""not right"" even when they do work. Customer Service from Infocus has been horrible and I am done with them as a company to do business with."
1,Worst projector our company has ever bought,"They're small... They're beautiful... but they're totally unreliable. Of the 30 LP120 we own, only 3 of them have not yet required service( i said not yet...). I have 7 broken ones now. LAMP DID NOT STRIKE... LAMP SHUT OFF..... are usually the welcome message with the LP120.....BUYERS BEWARE.. Turn around time for a repair 2 months...."
4,"Great projector, terrible support from infocus",A great projector for travel. Infocus tech support is terrible for service so make sure you have a authorized support dealer near you.
3,Projector never turns off,"Don't buy this if you value a bit of peace and quiet. This isn't a case of the projector being broken, this is actually how it was designed! When you power it off, the lamp turns off and the fan slows down but it DOES NOT STOP! The only way to get the fan completely off is to unplug the unit.I understand that the bulb requires a cool-off period, so the fan should stay on for a while, but this fan NEVER turns off."
1,Work gloves fell apart in a few hours,I bought these gloves as a gift for my brother based on another reviewer's positive comments. My brother does hardscaping for a living. The gloves fell apart in a few hours. He said the cotton gloves that he buys from the hardware store for a few dollars last at least a few days.
3,My kind of club music,"Kerrier District pulls off a well made, hip update of disco pacing that does after some time become boring when the music revolves around that single tempo with uninspired sound clips guiding us through the shallow journey. Thankfully, most tracks are not like that, as Luke Vibert once again attests to the fact that he is one of the only artist's who can make decent art in an overwhelmingly shallow and cheesily produced genre. When the tracks work best is the same case as with any other project of his- when he is truly trying to step outside of himself as a house artist, utilizing his slick production skills and wonderful keyboard approach in ways that do more then just make you want to get up and dance, or at least make you want to articulate your dance patterns that much more specificly to reflect the nature of this intellegent dancesmith."
4,Kerrier District - Luke Vibert,"What can I say, Kerrier District is the perfect house record. Deep grooves, distinct lack of boring sections, everything's balanced right, lush keyboards...some disturbing bass frequencies...I would recommend this even if you don't like house music, per se. It's just a really well crafted album."
2,Not for Newbies,A well organised book for full time statistic's students but not for part-timers or those with only a general interest in Statistics. This is an exam revision text.
