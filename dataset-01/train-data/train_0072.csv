5,Get ready to jump.,"This is a straight out, no apologies horror film. It features a very strong and central lead performance from Ryan Reynolds but its true purpose is to scare. It does so almost from the beginning. The back story of the house is quite clever, even though it cribs from Poltergeist. Girls will scream, guys will jump and everyone will have a good time."
4,scary as heck!!,"The family the lutz find their dream house and soon move into it. However After they move into the house they experience one horror after another. From make belive friends, to doors closing by themselves and money comming up missing, the house delivers a true horror to the family. Based on a supposedly ""true"" story, The Amityville horror delivers a high level of shock value.. what makes this movie so scary is the atmosphere of the setting . The movie is set in a house with back windows that when lit up look like eyes(view the cover of the movie), and most of the time the horrors occur at nightime.. Also the score of the movie really sets the tone . All in all this is a good horror movie that is sure to send a few chills up your spine..I recommend this movie to any horror fan"
2,Don't waste your time,"What conceivable reason could there be for making this movie? We all basically know the story and we all know that the ""true story"" behind it is bogus. Moreover, the movie isn't all that long--about 80 minutes not including the credits. This is basically enough to skim through the story without any real depth or development. The acting is fairly mediocre--the babysitter being the exception--and can't say much for the dialogue either. In the end, not all that frightening, and not really worth the time."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Despite a few chills, The Amityville Horror goes on for a long time without anything much of interest happening and ends with a particularly flat denouement."
1,"The ""horror"" of this film...","is realizing 90 minutes of your life has passed without a moment's entertainment. I'm astounded that some reviewers gave this numerous stars. As a horror buff, this is one of the worst films I've encountered. Scary? Nope. So bad it's good? Nope. Just plain bad. Why can't modern directors create mood anymore? While production values are strong -- with some fine camera work -- this mess isn't in the least bit involving. The priest is little more than a cameo, the ending is lame, and while I didn't expect the walls to run blood like in the original, there was nothing comparable. Worst part? Killing the dog. If only the whole family had met a similar end...."
3,A little bit of 'horror' here.,"I haven't seen the first one, so I can't tell you how this compares, but I'm thinking the first one is better. This remake is average to me, I didn't find it scary. I think the remakes are failing nowadays, as are most horror films. The acting was tolerable, but nothing award worthy. I would suggest holding off until this one hits video stores as well because the ticket price is a little high for what you are getting here (I only paid 3.00, which wasn't all that bad)"
2,the clock radio made me do it!!!,"re-make of the not so great original has The Lutz Family, husband George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade: Trinity, The Alarmist) and Mrs. Lutz played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Sugar & Spice). They move in and find out that there was a murder that happened in that house. Soon, things start to boil up as the man of the house, George Lutz hears voices to tell him to kill his family because they are demons. ""House's dont kill people, people kill people."" explains George. Mrs. Lutz thinks something array as she sees her husband is transforming into a monster. Not much fun really, just like the original with some pretty boring blood splattering moments though Reynolds is very confincing in his psycho-possessed performance and some pretty good direction. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) as the priest. Michael Bay Produced and he also did Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I have no clue why he produced that and this."
4,Entertaining remake with a few good scares.....,"Overall I think this film is an improvement over the original 1979 Amityville Horror film. This one definately has more replay value as it is beautifully shot and well acted. Let's face it, directors and the movie making technology they use are constantly evolving. Horror movies in the 70's were pretty cheesy for the most part (Halloween and The Exorcist being 2 exceptions). When I was 10, the TRAILERS for the original Amityville film scared the **** out of me! Now I watch the original film and actually find it quite boring. This remake injects some life into the story and brings it to a whole new audience. So what if some things aren't 100% accurate from the book. It's a MOVIE. It's sole purpose is to entertain! If only 25% of this film is based on the facts, then it's still a pretty horrifying story!"
2,Poorly Done,"Even as an early 80's late 70's movie, this movie is still a very sub par film because it lackes the fear and scare scenes that a lot of this era's movies dish out. Furthermore, many of the characters you only know because they happen to be seen in a few scenes. Other than that you don't get a spooky atmosphere or feel empathy for any of the characters. Poorly acted and directed."
2,OH PLEASE!,"This movie is soo humm... what can I said? When I watched them, it does nto make any sense at all. I have a lot of questions that are unanswered. I am sorry to say that but they are not what you think they are. The house is about to blow up? YEA RIGHT! This movie not soo thrilled at all and it left us wondered if that s true ? Tell you what? They are totally hoax!"
1,This movie bites,"The Amityville Horror is torture to watch. It is soooo boring and the acting is so lame that I almost puked. The ""scares"" are few and far between and when there is a ""scary"" part - it's boring! The special effects are really cheesy as well. The whole ending is ridiculous with the man saving his dog and all that. Do not rent this film, buy it or watch it if it comes on T.V."
1,NOT TRUE DON'T BELIEVE IT,"No this is not based on a true story. The Lutzes made up everything and if you do some research, you'll find that many facts are incorrect. (I.E. They're was no huge snowstorm that year, and the Lutzes never called the police to look around) Under oath in the court of law, George Lutz admited the story was MADE UP by Jay Anson. It is not true."
2,BIG BUDGET POOP !,"The new remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" plays very much like the other recent cheap hollywood flops such as ""The Boogyman"" & Wes Craven's ""Cursed"" they all start off great & then belly flop into unbearable cheese. Alot like ""The Boogyman"" Amityville has plenty going for it & then it just craps out in the end. The original is better even without all the new special efx! Imagine what it would've looked like if they did have the same technology back then!"
3,WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE OUT?,"Whether we really needed a remake of this 70s horror film, this latest resurrection of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR does have its moments of fright and frenzy. Director Andrew Douglas keeps things moving pretty crisply. Ryan Reynolds all buffed up from his role in BLADE 2 is not the world's greatest actor, and there are times when the usually comic Reynolds seems way over his head in trying to demonstrate his conversion from Mr. Nice Guy to Mr. Demento. Melissa George is little better in her role as the put upon wife who tries to get Reynolds to move her and the family out of this obviously possessed house. The remake maintains the notorious flies attacking the priest sequence, but the GET OUT segment isn't quite as overpowering as in the original. As in the original, one has to question the validity of this supposedly ""true story"", but for horror fans, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR isn't all that bad, nor is it all that great."
3,The Amityville Horror,"This is an above-average film about haunted houses, and makes it a little creepy and fun to watch because of the so-called true story behind the book and this film. Margot Kidder and James Brolin are pretty good as the young couple who purchase a large house, to bring their children to as well. When strange things occur, the family begins a suspenseful escape from the house, which apparently has a life of its own.The special effects are sometimes imaginitive and scary (such as the blood and ooze ejecting from the walls), but they can also be silly and embarrassing (the red eyes watching from the window). The music score is really absorbing and eerie, adding more atmosphere. It's no wonder the score was nominated for an Oscar. Overall, like I said, it's an above-average film with some good suspense, but something just feels missing. I don't know what, but it's apparent in its absence."
2,21st century 'reimagining' of controversial ghost story,"THE AMITYVILLE HORROR(USA - 2005)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA young couple (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are driven from their dream home by ghostly manifestations which compel Reynolds to the brink of murder.Less an examination of supernatural horror than a study of one man's descent into mental breakdown, prompted by unspecified forces within a house built on the foundations of murder and mayhem. Reynolds is quite affecting as the tormented protagonist in this beefed-up 'reimagining' of Jay Anson's bestselling book, though the slow accumulation of details doesn't build to a satisfying whole. Miles better than the 1979 version, however. Oh, and Reynolds gets this reviewer's vote as Hunk of the Year - his shirtless scenes are a highlight of the entire picture. Drool, slobber!!..."
3,The Amityville Horror 2005,"There are 8 Deleted Scenes in The Amityville Horror 2005 that are not in the movie. I think its stubid cutting out the 8 deleted scenes. Someday, later in the Future, I hope they will put in the 8 deleted scenes in the movie, so the movie will be uncut. I would think the movie would have been alot better with the 8 deleted scenes in the movie. the movie is 100 minutes long, but was droped down to 89 minutes long. Jamey P.S. I do think Rachel Nichols is cute. I wished I had her as a girl Friend."
5,SCARY,"I love scary movies, but ive never watched a movie that really scared me to wear i screamed or had to sleep with all the lights on, but this movie truely did all of this for me. It is soo scary. I've never seen a movie this scary, and I've seen pretty much every scary movie or there from The Exorcist to Darkness Falls but none even came close to how scarty this movie is. It is way different from the orginal but the orginal was so fake and boring you could fall asleep to it, but the remake really makes this a classic ghost story. SO go see it buy it you wont regret it if your into really scary movies!!"
2,Sorry but this version did nothing for me,"I know people are tired of hearing how remakes are bad and originals are best, but in most cases it's true I was not effected by the 2005 version at all, sure Ryan Reynolds is fun to look at, and the acting in the film was great, but the story changes, and the ambiance through out the film was not as creepy as the older 1979 version, in fact I was so bored half way through that I nearly lost track of what was happening, by the way I watched the film on cable uncut and commercial free so I was able to view this snooser in it's full non glory lol, just didn't like it at all just have to be honestI still feel that the 1979 version starring Margot Kidder and James Brolin is best out of all other Amityville films made so far. Well on a good note the the newest version is in wide-screen format and it's a special edition and also in blu-ray format so that's a plus for those of you who enjoyed this version. thanks for reading my opinion."
4,THE AMITYVILLE HORROR,pretty surprised by this film after it took a beating by reviewers..i watched it with my wife and after the 40 min mark she bailed because she was too scared to watch the rest..this movie moves very fast with the scares seem like every few minutes there was some tension..check this one out
3,I agree with Charles and Melissa,"I love Amityville anything and if you love true ghost stories then you must read ""Hell's Gate by Douglas Hensley"", a real haunting story and The Myrtles Plantation, another true ghost story and one of my all time favorites, THE ENTITY."
1,Don't waste your money,"I went to see this horrible movie with my father and I was dissapointed. How can people in the movie world get away with making such trash? I guess the real question is: Why do people pay money to see it? It is scary, but the plot is stupid. And how can the family dog die? I was very mad about this. I wanted to leave when it happened. Don't waste your money on this movie."
1,The original is better!,"The original is still the best. This remake goes off track by failing to build anything suspenseful. Even the obvious introduction of elements from other horror movies, specifically poltergist, involving Indian burial grounds and even a 'Cain' type figure, doesn't help the situation. There may be one or two 'jump' moments but for the most part, this movie is disappointing.So, avoid this like the plague, and rent the 1979 original!"
4,A Classic Haunted House Story,"I remember reading the book-which as always is better than the film-but overall this is a classic supernatural thriller. It was big in its day and still holds up pretty well.A recently married couple (George and Kathleen Lutz) and their three children buy a huge house in Amityville, New York. It was only a year ago when a 20 year old man murdered his family in that same house with a shotgun. However, this does not stop Kathleen or George from occupying it. Everything seems fine at first. The new family moves in and is soon besieged by bumps in the night, endless flies, pig eyes and creepy happenings.Turn off all the lights and enjoy it!"
1,Hamityville,"I remembered this being good - I was wrong. Perhaps I have been spoiled by a couple of decades of CGI's intervening, and also in those days, pre-video, too young to bluff my way into the cinema...you took what horror movies you could get.James Brolin's acting is the strongest thing in the movie, but the script is poor - the menace never materialises (think of the climax when he returns for the dog...what happens? er...not a lot) Rod Steiger as usual hams it up, and the rest of the cast is mediocre. Avoid."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a horrible movie! The movie starts out in a good direction, but nothing really happens after the first 15 minutes. It's boring and certainly not scary. I only gave it one star because there isn't an option for no star. Spend your money on something else."
1,Why is this a classic?,"I was really disappointed by this film. It's considered a horror classic, so I felt the need to watch it, but for your sake, don't bother. It's way too long, had sub plots that don't go anywhere, the scariest moments happen in the first 2 minutes, and doesn't have any original ideas that weren't done better BEFORE this film was made. Skip it"
3,good,being interested in the paranormal i thought this was a rather excellent story. i was later disappointed to learn that it was all a hoax. but it still scared the living hell out of me.
3,some of the movie is true.,"Well I for one live in Long Island not to far from the real house and I know that people did die in the house but ghost had nothing to do with it the second movie is not good but take out hte ghost and the movie is true he did kill his family but people live in the house now and they are fine, as far as the movie goes it is okay better than the horror movies they are making now but see the second movie ""Amityville 2: The Possession"" that is some what telling you what really happen the kid got mad and killed his family. the movie was okay."
4,Fun and very chilling!,"A family move into a really cool Long Island house. There, they experience strange happingings. You all probably know the story, but they end up running away at the end after they are chased out by the demons and black ooze seeping from the walls. Cool movie, definitly worth seeing. If you wanna know more, rent it!"
1,Shameful,"The acting is good, but it can't make up for a really, really bad script. Shame on Michael Bay. I expected much better of him."
2,My 2 cents,"I saw the original on TV (so heavily edited). I realy didn't find this movie scary or any of the characters apeallng. I didn't care if they were about to die or whatever. I would have found it more interesting if they did more with the reason what happened, happened(I don't want to give to much away, forgive my vagueness).Michael Bay produced the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I thought was horrible. If you liked that, you might not like this, not very much gore."
3,An improvement over the original.,"This movie was alittle better than the original that was not liked by many people, but grossed 86 million at the box office, making it the most successful independent film back when it came out. This version is better because it's faster, and makes more sense. Ryan Renalds gives a better performance then James Browlin, and so does the rest of the cast. Watch this movie over the original, because it is more enjoyable, but not very much."
2,"better than the remake,butthat doesn't mean it's good","i swear that the summer i read the novel it rained everyday i would read. the movie,well to be kind,is just no good. at no time was i ever scared like i was reading the book. the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack which is spooky."
3,Get OUT!,"Nearly 21 years after its release, this film still gives me the CREEPS! The music alone makes me shiver when I hear it! The question of whether or not it is a true story remains doubtful, but the fact that a man murdered his parents and siblings in the house on a rainy night still disturbs me. I do believe in the existence of some type of supernatural vibrations, and I can't watch this movie without shuddering every time the clock turns to 3:15 a.m. when the murders occured. I've read everyone's comments, and I agree with some of the film's shortcomings. But I still feel a sense of unease when I watch this in my parent's house, and find myself nervous about going near the windows after dark because of what is lurking outside. It may or may not scare you, but the film is worth a look!"
3,Disappointed,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. Frankly, for a person who doesn't get into horror movies this one did nothing for me. I wouldn't recommend anyone I know to spend their money on this, I'll give them my copy."
2,horror flick,"For it's time, it may have been more impressive, but I thought it lacking in plot and without much ""horror"" so I'm giving it only two stars. If you must see it, rent, don't buy it."
4,DVD Version not great,This is one of my all time favorite horror movies. The movie is very suspenseful and has some great scenes. It actually has a plot which is unusual for many horror films back in the 80's. I too agree that this DVD was way too much. I would have liked more extras for the price. Also the music was just wrong. After being terrified by the music in the VHS version it would have been nice to have it on the DVD. The dance music at the beginning was all wrong and took away the scariness of the first scene.
3,Scary Enough,I thought it was scary enough to pass for a good horror movie for the standards of today. I think it could have been scarier like the original. It was missing the pure evil feeling from the first Amityville Horror. The closet babysitter scene was pretty cool though.
3,Takes Itself Too Seriously,"The Amityville Horror has a few creepy moments, but not much gore and no real drama. It claims to be based on a true story [hoax], which is laughable. That claim sets the tone for the whole production, which tries too hard to be serious and in the end comes across as phony.The problem with horror movies since Scream, of course, is that they don't take themselves seriously at all. I love the classic horror movies, and while Amityville makes a nice try at being one, it isn't."
3,"Ok, but could have been alot better.","The first time I had watched this movie was when I was about 10 yrs. old. It scared the hell out of me then, but as I got older and read the book, along with did some more research into the REAL story of what happened to George and Kathy Lutz and family in that house, I realized Hollywood would have done far, far better to have just stuck to the facts a little more closely. The Lutz's story as told in their own words, and not in the words of Jay Anson (the author of the book), or American International (the film makers) was far more terrifying. Special effects were terrible to say the least and the age of the film is no excuse. To see what a well made horror film is, see the Exorcist. The special effects were available. Again, the real story is terribly frightening, but it could have been portrayed far more accurately with better results."
3,On of the Best Haunting House movie!,"Waaaaah!! this House was very scares me espacially when I was young, and it's scares me again. The story is very good. and the sountrack is very very creepy (Children choir). I have expected that this movie based on a true story? A classic if you love this genre..."
3,execellent movie,"this movie was very good and I reccomend it to anyone, but they could have found someone better to play Kathy Lutz."
2,Sucked!,"Genre: HorrorGenre Grade: B+Final Grade: C+This movie had a fair share of ""jumpy"" moments and frights, but in the end failed to offer any substantial plot or story. While it was better than the original, it had potential to be much better, but it was not. Ryan Reynolds failed to prove himself as a serious actor (if only because of his sarcastic voice), although Melissa George did a good job playing a freaked out mother and wife.I would, however, recommend this film if you're looking to see an entertaining horror movie. The story might not give you much closure and the best parts of the movie seemed to be ignored for cheaper thrills, but it is still an entertaining horror flick.And it's a good idea to not say ""Katch 'em, Kill 'em!"" to your girlfriend in a dark raspy voice after seeing this movie."
2,Mild entertainment.,"Fans of the original might want to avoid this. Rent ""Amityville 2: The Possession"" if you want to see something really scary. It depicts the Defeo family's story (preceding the Lutz's), and includes one of the most frightening scenes I've yet seen in a movie.The story about the evil missionary was sort of interesting. It just wasn't scary, unfortunately. It sounds like it could be an interesting idea for a better filmmaker. Also, I think it would have worked better to not have such an explanation of the presence, unlike the mystery in the first film.The whole film had an unrealistic, fantastical, sci-fi channel quality, which just doesn't work for a supposedly true story."
2,It was...OKAY,"After watching this film the only question I have is...WHY? Why was this film even remade? Nothing changed. The script is bland. The dialogue is boring. Nobody dies....except the family dog. It felt like such a waste of time to watch this. There's some mediocre suspenseful moments, but in spite of the gory images, the film is actually tame. As a director if you have an R rated film, you need to go all out! Don't give us the typical Hollywood happy ending crap. The only good thing about the film is the acting. Everyone did an outstanding job of really becoming their characters. If you happen to be a Ryan Reynolds fan, maybe you'll want to watch the movie. But if you've seen the original Amityville, I wouldn't bother."
5,Masterpiece!,This is the most deepest and scariest horror-movie i have ever seen. It brings out the most nightmarish fantasies out of our heads. And youll defenetly heave a bad headace the next morning of insomnia. The fact that its a true story makes it even more suspensfull... See it!
3,"always a horror classic, but...","I saw this movie only once as a kid. Always considered it one of my favorites, but darn, I found that it couldnt stand the test of time. Bad, bad movie, full of cliches, predictable, slow..."
5,Classic!!!!!!!,"This movie is a perfect example of how a filmaker can use simple techniques and a good eye to creep you out. Every shot is brilliant with its use of lighting, shadow, and imagery. The film is one of those slow building, intelligent, stylistic, pshycological horror films that you just don't see anymore. These factors of slow building mood and atmosphere combined with the stunning performances the actors give make this film seem very realistic, as opposed to the new horror movies about haunted houses where computer generated ghosts predictably chase people around from the get-go, leaving nothing to the imagination. This movie stands the test of time and is still terrifying all these years later."
4,.,"This movie is fun to watch. James Brolin constantly ""checking the fire"" and Margot Kidder somehow stays sane in the film but in real life is possesed by demons."
2,Don't watch this one in the dark....,"You're liable to wake up with neck pains from falling asleep in your recliner.Did this movie have an ending? I'm not dogging the acting or the music score, but the story itself seemed unfinished. Why have sub-stories if your not going to finish them? I love classic horror, and like 90% of the old AIP Pictures, but this one just left me sitting there saying ""What a Waste"""
1,Awful,"This movie was even worse then the first one. What was it all the actors in it were saying that it was going to be more true to the book? WRONG the only thing that was like the book was the name Jodi, and even that was a lie, none of the Defoe children was named Jodi. That was an insult and the living Defoe family should sue over. the lack of taste the writers and producer had to the memory of this family that lost their lives there. The Lutzes should sue as well. This was far from the book and if the story was true...the book i mean it was not like this at all. No pig--that was what Jodi was...no red room. Nothing at all. This was just a bad horror movie and was so stubid. I'm just glad I was able to download it off the computer and not have spent any money seeing it."
1,silly pointless remake of a great movie,"I loved the original Amityville Horror , never saw the sequels , but could not have expected a total dasterdly remake of a film so good you want to watch it again and again. Don't see this movie."
2,Oh Please...,"In this ""chiller"" about a family who move into a haunted house (that's basically the entire plot), the only thing that's scary is how bad it is! While it does have a few good scenes, it really doesn't generate too many chills. The so/so effects are sometimes laughable and the acting isn't that good at all. You won't be missing out on much if you skip this one."
1,About as fun as watching a fly buzz around your face.,"James Brolin and Margot Kidder are newly weds who find out their quaint house is...gasp...haunted! Unbelievably boring movie is packed full of laughably silly moments and revelations that make no sense, and Brolin increasingly appears more and more like Charlie Manson throughout the film! This is as bad as haunted house films get."
1,BAD STORY + BAD ACTING = A REALLY BAD FILM,THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in my opinion is an example of how bad a movie can be. JAMES BROLIN and MARGOT KIDDER are awful as the couple that moves into what seems to be a nice house turned nightmare they act like they're bored to death and it shows. The effects are awful in this film too just watch and you'll see what I mean so in my opinion avoid THE AMITYVILLE HORROR.
5,"Scary, Scary","Yes so it was a hoax, big deal. It still is scary, but nobody wants to take it seriously anymore. Take it seriously, watch it alone in the dark. Like the Blair Witch this film was ruined because the producres had to declare that it was a hoax, then people considered it laughable. As I recall when it first came out everyone was scared!! Stop ruining a great film and take it seriously!!!"
1,Absolute zero,One of the worst films ever made. Classic stupidity of horror movies. Dead people that have become alive again. I would give it a rating of 0/10. The actors are good but the storyline terrible. Glad I saw it on TV and not bought it.
2,"Excellent Quality, BUT ...","OxoSpoonReview (#59191)The quality is superb, the kind that's a pleasure to own, BUT:Imo, it is too large for the average user, AND:The ergonomics are off-mark: used at normal height (stovetop) the angle of the bowl to the shaft is completely wrong. But if you use it a mid-thigh or knee level, it's exactly right.Fortunately, the shaft is not so difficult to bend, so now the angle is right. But it's still too big (for me), can't figure a way to fix that."
3,Early history of heavy metal yelling,"Not listening to the album before I review it the love prevails stands out in my mind with an excellent guitar introduction. I also remember another song with a great drum beat and riff, eye of terror is a decent song the rest to me is just thrown on the album but can still stand out as better than mediocre just because it was out in 1989-90. The guitar solos have an out of this world sound not heard on many a album. This competes with At The Gates Gardens of Grief/embrace of evil album for the time period but I would say At the Gates has made better album and albums."
5,THE classic album ...,"OK, granted the CD is what, at least 13 years old now ... but when it came out, it was worth 5 stars, if not more.Think of Bolt Thrower like this:If you are strolling through the desolate wasteland that is the death metal genre, you will eventually come upon a mighty citadel, which houses the legends ... Death, Coroner, Entombed, etc. Guarding that citadel with much vigilance is a massive war machine, with the words ""Bolt Thrower"" emblazoned on the side, threatening violence to all who don't show their proper respects.And that shows in their music, too. Buy ANY Bolt Thrower CD you can get your hands on. I guarantee it."
5,It's like a party in my ears,"and everyone decide to make a pinata out of my balls!!! Astonishing grinding guitars and semiarabic rhythms in world eater track are still my fave....roaaaaaarrrr!!!Get it now or those pinata bashers will seek you out for cowardice, the metal gods have spoken!!!"
5,Smells wonderful and is NOT a fake,"I ordered this for my husband since this has been his cologne for years and recently run out. BTW I love how it smells! It smells sooo good! It's definitely the real deal. This comes in a big bottle and won't run out anytime soon. I bought it for 30-something dollars so that was a good deal because at a mall, perfume store, etc. I would have paid lots more for the same product. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Physical Therapist You Can Take Home!,"Injuring my upper arm and shoulder in a minor motorcycle spill, and refusing to pay $40/hr. for physio-therapy, I needed to find a less expensive alternative. The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook was the ideal guide for me. Using inexpensive tubing at home, I was able to exercise the exact muscle groups required and working slowly through the clear instructions and well demonstrated routines, I now have over 90% of my original mobility back in my left arm and shoulder. I found the section on the Rotator Cuff of particular interest for my application. The guide is colourful, simple to follow and a good value for [the money]-- when you consider I would have spent about $400 going to a clinic. Although I'll never use the latin names for the muscle groups in daily conversation, the body diagrams in the book provided a good review, should I ever need to talk to my Doctor about specific muscles."
2,Buyer Beware,"I teach a group exercise class that uses tubing. I wanted a book to give me some new exercise ideas. This book gives the reader tube exercises--but you have to attach the tube to a doorway! It is not a good a good reference book if you are looking for something to use for a group. If a person were just starting an exercise program at home and wanted a beginners book, this would be OK. Also, for the price it is little more that a pamphlet--kinda a rip. Does have some nice beginners streches and muscle diagrams."
5,Fine Exercise Book,"If you don't want to travel with 200 lbs of weights, then stretch tubing is the way to go. Leave your weights at home, and take a small bag of stretch tubing when you're on the road or on vacation. The tubing offers resistance, which is what strength training is all about. This book tells you just how to use the tubing to get the most out of it. There are good color pictures and detailed instructions. The only thing better would be to have someone do the exercises for you."
1,1 Star,"While the video assumes the position from a couples angle, I personally found it to be of little assistance to me. Excessive medical commentary makes this video a little long and drawn out."
2,Ok but Not Great,I saw him live in 1987 when he was hot and hoped this would be a great reminder of his hilarious sense of humor and delivery but it was far too short (only 45 minutes) and only had a couple of good routines. My hopes were higher than what this delivered! The bonus material was taken from Vegas when he was near the end and it really was not very funny. I would recommend looking at another DVD of his rather than purhcase this one.
4,Healthy for you.,"It takes like swamp water, but my husband would experiment mixing it with different juices and mixes to see if we could get it to taste better. But I have to say, it has everything you could possible need in a day for vegetables and that made me feel better."
5,"If you have CFS, you need to try this","I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome about a year ago through a heart rate variability test and blood work. The blood test results showed a low white blood cell count and high AST/ALT levels. Ever since I began a daily regiment of Green Vibrance, my WBC count and liver enzyme levels have improved incrementally. Furthermore, nothing else has changed in my daily routine besides the addition of Green Vibrance to my diet. The taste is truly awful, but this should not be recognized as food, rather, it should be considered medication."
5,GREAT!,Arrived earlier than expected and love this stuff! First time buying and Im glad i did.. great in smoothies or juice... best in Mango juice so far. Some add this to their yogurt. Worth it to get it on amazon for cheaper than in the natural food stores!
5,Life changing stuff!,"My wife and I both started taking this stuff about 14 days ago. We both have more energy, sleep better, all around feel better. I have nasty allergies and my eyes would hurt all day long. I was an eye drop addict. After taking this stuff, I use my eye drops once a day. Gotta be the green stuff right?"
5,Excellent product and service,Thank you for your quick shipment and excellent product at a great price. My husband and I use it virtually every day.
4,"Good quality, but IMHO way too expensive compared to others!",Good product but in my opinion too expensive for what you get. Now Foods has a Phytofood that is comparable but A LOT LESS MONEY FOR MORE PRODUCT.
3,Hmm...,"Product received great reviews everywhere...it's OK, I guess. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviews online are fake."
1,I don't get it,"Wow......I don't get it!!! After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is. I rushed to ""Vitamin Shoppe"" to purchase this amazing product (yeah, right!!) I drink energy drinks and protein shakes on a daily bases. The taste was bearable like any other powder supplement I drink, no big deal nothing to fuss about. However, the benefits that everyone claims are so wonderful. I just don't get it. I mixed the supplement with 8oz Vanilla Soy milk and a banana. Went to work and felt so fatigue and yawned all morning, my Co Worker asked me ""what is wrong with you"" I took the supplement again the next morning and yawned like crazy again etc.... This product sucks and I wish I hadn't spent my hard earned money on this junk. (wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars) I don't get it! I read this forum and value everyones opinion like it's the gospel truth....I'm confused."
2,Not for my kids!,Bought this hoping to get some greens into my children's diet. Could not even hide the taste of new mowed lawn in other foods or drinks.
4,I like the product take it every day.,I stay healthy and this product may or may not be a factor. I like to think so or I would not be using it.BK
2,Too much iron,"I have finished half of a 720 grams (25,4 oz.) jar and noticed that this product (version 10.1) has 16.4 mg. of iron per serving. In my opinion, this is far too much iron for an adult male. I dumped the remainder on my compost pile. I understand they may have reduced the iron level in the newer version??"
3,I'll try it again,I like the fact that it is full of green foods and probiotics and the taste is okay.Good family size and good for improving bowel function.
3,So far no energy boost at all,"I bought this because of all the great reviews. And, I wanted to add it to my fruit smoothies with protein to get some added nutritional benefit. I will continue to use it, but I've not noticed any zip in energy. In fact sitting her now at 4pm I feel very tired. And I'm having some type of stomach cramp on the right side. I had my smoothy with Vibrance at 8am this morning and have not felt energized all day.I will still use it for the health benefits. If you mix it with protein powder, berries and some coconut oil, you don't notice the bad taste."
4,Great product.,I will continue to use this product because I can feel the difference from when I don't use it. Great ingredients.
5,great product,I heard of this product from a friend and tried it. Its taste isn't bad and Amazon has the best price I could find. Hope this vender stays on Amazon and keeps the great price for this product. My sister tried it also and said it helps with her energy levels throughout the day.
5,Great Product,Product was easy to take and did not taste bad. It does not look good but very easy to take and very little after taste. I would tell anyone who does not eat green veggie to try this. It is really a good source for getting the green veggie you need with out eating so much.
5,Good Stuff but tastes like Rancid Lawn Clippings!,You don't buy this stuff to enjoy sipping it. On the instructions is recommends adding to your favorite beverage. I wouldn't ruin something you like by associating it with the taste of this stuff. Just toss in a blender with a few ounces of water and chug it down with your nose closed while having a strong chaser at the ready. Does what you want it too...keeps you regular and energetic.
2,Dunno...,"I finished the 60 day supply and didn't really notice any great benefits from it. It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water. Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after. Other than that, it was pretty expensive and I didn't feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews. I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who don't like their veggies??"
5,I love this product!,"I've been using this product for around 3 years. I didn't use it for the 9 months I was pregnant because I wasn't sure if it was safe for pregnant women, but it probably would've help with the lack of energy I experienced. :\ I always drink it the first thing in the morning. I used to make a smootie with it, but now I make a quick shake, as I don't have the time in the morning like I did before, with a little one. My shake consist of this powder, yogurt, oj, milk, chia seeds, cinnamon, and agave nectar. I put it all in a container with two ice cube... shake, and that's my morning energy boost. I love it. I can't say I feel a boost of energy, but I feel good. Not tired in the morning at all... and very regular. :)"
1,Would not recommend,"I bought this product because it was the highest rated amongst the green drink powders on amazon.Firstly I will say that the taste is horrible, and with products like this that is expected and acceptable, but this one seems to be particularly bad.Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have, the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green, nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had. Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product. Hope this review was helpful to you."
1,Great Product - Misleading AD!!!,The image for this product shows the larger 22 oz. bottle when they are actually selling the 12.1 oz(344 gram)product. Apparently they also send 16 grams more(a tiny amount) with the 344 gram product.This is NOT a good deal - don't be fooled into thinking you will get the 22 oz. bottle they display.You can find a much better deal.
1,16% price jump,"bought for $50 a month ago, now price jumps 16% to $58, will not but again, this is costing too much, it is like $2/day"
4,Alkalize to live....,"We had been using All Day Energy Greens from the Institute for Vibrant Living before we compared ingredients to Green Vibrance. Green Vibrance is not as sweet but I feel it has had a positive change in replacing good bacteria in the intestines and helps to push waste through. I have noticed increased energy levels and just an all around sense of well being. Because I like mine sweeter,I mix mine with four to eight ounces of juice in the morning. My husband also drinks this but mixes his with water. Some people may find it hard to drink the ""gritty-ness"" of green drinks but I don't think it is too bad. Flavor wise, this is pretty mild. I have actually found myself craving it more than once a day. This drink helps to alkalize my body and helps eliminate my acid reflux symptoms like my esophagial spasms. If you have never had a green drink, I would start with a smaller container to see if you even like it."
1,This is an old product!! Current Version 11.0,"I contacted Vibrant Health, the manufacturer of Green Vibrance, and they informed me the current version is 11.0. Amazon is selling version 10.3. Version 10.3 contains soy lecithin! The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers, a safe form of lecithin, and no soy lecithin!! Vibrant Health also informed me they don't directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance! In the future I am only going to purchase fresh, current versions of Green Vibrance!!! I did an online chat with an Amazon representative and he informed me he has no way of telling what version Amazon is selling today. I bought mine 2months ago and a friend just bought some a week ago and both are version 10.3."
4,"So far, so good....",Still new to this product but I feel energized and more focused after taking it. Hoping the good feelings persist.
5,Great product and price. Fast shipping.,"This is the best price that I have seen for this product! The shipping was fast, showed up ahead of schedule. I have been taking this product for years and can honestly say that it does make you feel better."
5,good stuff,I'm gonna say right off the taste to me is horrible!!! o have not enough courage to drink with water.....yet. I use grape juice to her it down. I have been slacking off even though I purchased the big canister. good price here too. if you want to get your veggies in drink this stuff you can't go wrongI will drink some today and get back on point. I have noticed when you have vitamins in your system you don't crave s lot of crap!
5,I feel healthy...,I am taking this stuff on the advice of a friend. I like the idea of getting more greens in my diet-- I just add it to my morning smoothies. It really does not taste that bad!
5,"Great product, worth every penny!","Recieved my product promptly & was very pleased with it. I've also recommended it to others, they've tried it and have made purchases as well. Great source of everything you need for healthy living!"
4,Works well but no startling effects for the cost,It works okay. Provides a little boost of energy in the morning and may slowly be affecting my digestive track. I haven't been full blown sick since I started taking it. I did get a little sick but then I got over it. Overall I'd recommend the product but at almost $60 for a two month supply I'd say only buy it if you're serious about taking using it.
4,The ingredients are outstanding but the taste is halting.,"I have only been taking the Vibrant Health for a short time. I will be watching for results to see if I will continue to use it. I am impressed that is gluten free and has an abundance of vitamins, herbs, and minerals."
3,Not bad - kinda grows on you,"It's not bad, I kinda been getting use to it. I mix it w/Sunny D smooth instead; it doesn't seem to mix real well b/c it's a very light-weight powder. I've tried both whisking and using a spoon but it doesn't all seem to blend very well. I will say I have noticed a difference in less aches and pains that I've been having now being in my 50's. I usually drink it first thing in the morning b/f breakfast."
5,great value,I have used this product for years. The price was right. It was shipped promply and was as advertised. I will continue to Be a customer.
4,Good Stuff,First time trying product. Mixes reasonably well for a green powder and ok if you put it in juice. Couldn't handle it in water.
5,One of the Best Ways to Stay Healthy,"I've enjoyed this product for some years and believe it is one of the best products for giving you energy, keeping your immune system, and helping you stay young. Don't go a day without it! - Dr. Lisa Love, Beyond the Secret"
5,All Greens,I think it would be impossible to consume ALL the fine healthy ingredients in this product on a daily basis any other way!!
3,OMG this tastes BAD,I wound up giving this to my dad... it tastes sooo bad its almost unbelievable.. it tastes like grass clippings.. my father likes it... he swears it makes him feel better.. but that's only because he had a head injury and cant taste very well anymore.. i think that's the only way he can stomach it..
3,Ehh...,"I bought this item with high expectations after reading all the reviews...After a few weeks of use, I can't say I feel any difference both short term (right after I take it) or long term(since I started taking it). I continue to take it, much as I do vitamins, on the good faith that it's beneficial for me, even though I feel no difference physically."
2,taste awful,smell bad and taste awful. I could not sleep well at night after having this product after dinner. quit it.
2,"Maybe good, but YUCK.","I am still awaiting any immense benefits, but the only way I can drink this is in orange juice while holding my nose. It's been just over a week, so I'll be happy to give further updates and let you know if I get use to the awful taste. Rating is based on taste alone. After my first try, it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again. Hopeful :)"
4,@ traim,"His review of Nature's Secret is telling: ""Nature's Secret Ultimate Respiratory Cleanse Dietary Supplement Tablets, 60-Count Bottles (Pack of 3) (Health and Beauty)This product is excellent. I got immediate results! After only one day of use I could feel the toxins coming out of my lungs. I had a sore throat(healing crisis)and ever since I have been coughing up lots of yucky stuff. I feel myself breathing clearer after 3 days.P.S. I felt fine prior to taking this. I just felt it would be a good idea since I had a bad upper respiratory infection earlier this year during winter.""I've taken Green Vibrance for one day and felt a little more energetic and was less hungry. When I want to cough up lots of yucky stuff, guafenesin does the trick."
2,Navel Itched,"I'm in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions. One exception, though, is that I tend to experience the side-effects of medications rather severely. Therefore, I seldom take medications of any kind so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way. Nevertheless, after a couple of weeks, my navel itched non-stop. I checked myself: same soap, same bubble bath, same laundry detergents, etc. The only new thing in my life was this product. I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours. Several months have passed with no more itching. It could just be me so that's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. However, I thought I should mention my reaction in case someone else gets the same problem."
1,"the product is great, the seller is misleading","This is a great product, unfortunately the seller is suggesting you will recieve a 60 day supply based on the image they've shown for the product. That would be a great deal (to good to be true) instead you'll only recieve the 30 day supply & two single serving packets. Not any bargin at all in fact when you concider in shipping the price comes out to be higher then most healthfood stores can sell it for. Don't be fooled like I was. There are better deals on 60 day supplies from other sellers who aren't trying to fool you!"
4,Greens,"Although a little on the bland side (what would you expect from greens) I do like the taste when mixed with OJ or carrott juice. Can't say I feel any difference, but it's good to know that I'm getting my veggies and fruits."
4,Only watched the one..,"I've only seen Deer Woman, but that was ok. It was silly as hell, but it was a hoot. Brian Benben is just a naturally funny guy."
5,This was UnPlugged before it became fashionable.,"John Mayall did UnPlugged with this album long before MTV made it fashionable. After establishing himself as a leading force in electric blues Mayall surprises and delights with this live Filmore East concert featuring only acoustic guitars and flute. Long referred to as the ""drummer-less"" album it showcases a different side of Mayall. The musicians work hard to fill the space of normally electric-heavy songs with the crisp and contrasting sound of acoustic instruments and it works beautifully. For people looking for a good acoustic blues album you could not do much better than this one."
3,If only it were instrumentals,"I just bought this CD, after owning the vinyl way back then. I loved it back then. The musicians are excellent, really excellent.Now that I've gotten older perhaps, or started listening to lyrics more, I'd have a greater opinion of the cd if only the lyrics could be removed. They are way below par to the music being produced, and seem to constantly revolve around Mayall trying to use his star status to get laid in town to town, with no strings attached. Maybe one song like this would fly, but FIVE? Were it not for this, it would have gotten 5 stars from me.I can't even listen to it now.Perhaps I'll just go get a Mark-Almond CD to tide me over."
3,Instrumentally Good,"The band on this CD is great. I saw them live when they toured promoting this CD. My problem with this recording is that Mayall is an especially lame vocalist. I also agree with the reviewer who said that the lyrics were weak. Mayall has a great ear for talent, its too bad the didn't use that ear to hire a vocalist. In spite of the lyrics, I like most of the songs; although, ""Room to Move"" is all flash and no substance. It's showy and fun (especially live), but the harp playing is really nothing to write home about and the song is just a recycled ""Tequila"" riff played over and over again."
5,Acoustic Blues Deluxe,"One of the other reviewers calls this album a ""timeless classic"" and it is. Over the very many years that John Mayall has been making blues music he has developed a reputation as the foremost British interpreter of the guitar/harmonica-based Chicago blues style, and has worked with extradinary musicians (particularly guitarists- Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, among many others).This album is all acoustic and it is extradinary. Anyone who thinks only of Mayall's electric approach is missing a real treat here.Throughout his long and distinguished career John Mayall has been criticized for his vocals, and if you don't like them no one can help you with that. But, regardless, the musicianship on this work is so good, and the spark in the band is so uplifting, that his voice is of secondary concern.Highly recommended from a long-time blues lover."
5,good jazz blues mix,"This album is so different from John Mayall other albums it the first of his groups without a drummer but it is such a great sound my favorite track is California but the whole album is very good. Some of John best music was produced in this period, he is always experimenting with different combinations I was so lucky to see some of his line ups over the years. Unfortunately this was not one of them if you are like me when it comes to John Mayall this is one you should have in your collection."
5,The best acoustic no-drum album in existence,"john mayall has done a lot of music, but this album shows why he is a pioneer in the field of soft blues - from the opening track, mayall and john mark lay it down like no other. Great buy"
3,Not great,Short topical devotional on shame. I didn't find it to be very helpful or deep. A topic like this should be dealt with much more in depth.
1,Poor,Stated it was used. ENTIRE book was completely used as a journal all the way through from to back. NOT EVEN USEFUL and postage not worth sending back.
2,Misleading title,"Prospective buyers should be aware that the book is a feel-good discussion with a heavily religious slant. Anyone expecting an ideology-free discussion of the relationship between shame and intimacy should be prepared to read that ""God's remedy for legitimate shame is the Cross of Christ"" (p.9)."
1,Strongly discourage purchasing this item,"I bought this after much trepidation and now wish I had followed my gut instinct and not bought it. It rode up my back, the baby's head sat between my breasts instead of higher up my chest, the baby's head didn't have enough support so I still had to hold it and in my experience it made the child (and I) considerably more miserable. It was difficult to place my child inside and even worse getting him out. Granted, I have a large baby, but he is within the weight limits they suggest. I strongly discourage buying this product."
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"Pros:Easy on my back.Nice strong snap clipsCons:Hard to get baby in and out of (especially to get him out of, and especially when you have to dress baby warmly)Not a lot of head support (enough for my liking, but it made my husband comment on how much our son's head bobbed around in it)Can't breast feed baby while he's in it.I use it for now because it's still easier than holding in my arms for hours. Altogether it's not something I plan to continue using. I'm looking for another carrier that is more convenient to get him in and out of. I'm exploring the Ergo carrier (which I saw a friend use and it looked much easier) and the Moby Wrap."
2,At least it won't set you back a lot of $$$,"I found it very difficult to get my daughter in and out of this thing. And while it says it's good for a baby up to 20lbs, your back may not agree. My daughter was just under 18lbs (6mos old) the last time I used it (for airport travel)- I hoped this carrier would make things easier- but I eventually just had to take her out and carry her in my arms. Prior to this- we tried putting our daughter in it from time to time- and while she fell asleep in it once, most of the time she fussed...which is sad b/c my daughter is really even tempered. At least the price won't hurt your wallet and it seems to be well made. We just got a Kelty backpack carrier for our summer travel and hopefully that will be worth the $."
1,Not worth it,I used this one time and it was so much trouble trying to get my 3 month old in and out of here it was ridiculous. I couldnt get him out by myself my husband had to help everytime. Dont waste your money
1,Deceived,"DeceivedFirst of all, I thought I was getting a real book, with introduction, forward, publishing dates etc. for my book discussion group. Instead I got a strange copy - All it contained was the story on a format that was large print and almost manuscript size, making it difficult to read and to handle. This book turned out to be ""printed on demand; indicated by a print date at the back of the book ""December 27, 2012"". There was no indication that this book would be ""printed on demand"" with only the story, no context. I would not have purchased this edition if I had known, but would have purchased a ""used"" book instead.In future, I will not be purchasing any ""new"" books from Amazon, unless it is clearly stated what is what."
2,Uninteresting.,"There is no other way to say it, and I find this kind of thing hard to do (I know I'll receive a lot of negative votes from those who beam in because they like the book), but I'm sorry, I found it boring.Barely got through it all, but I ENDURED. With the enthusiasm of a kid who nibbles at the broccoli but can't wait to stuff the potatoes and gravy into his mouth. With this in mind, if you want to look at a similar book (that is much better) I would point you towards the rare ""King, Queen, Knave"" by Vladimir Nabokov, or the equally rare, ""The Temptation Of Eileen Hughes"" by Brain Moore: both available at amazon.com ....The only ""good"" thing about The Good Soldier is that he only blabs on for a little over 200 pages.Go ahead, kill me on your votes now...... honesty on my part is worth it. I want to spare you!"
5,A Masterpiece,"I've appreciated this book more as I've grown older. When I originally read the story I was a younger man; as I've aged, the dilemmas faced by the characters and the story have become more real to me and to how I see the world. This is a great book with lasting lessons."
4,The Good Read,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as, being an ebook, it comes without the usual blurb on the cover. I had heard it was excellent so decided to read it 'sight unseen'. It turned out to be quite different from what I was expecting, the title being somewhat misleading.I thoroughly enjoyed it though the text was peppered with small typos, eg hime for him and hear for heart. These typos did not ruin my enjoyment of this examination of a tragic love affair set in the early 1900s. It is told in non-chronological order flashback form. The story slowly unfolds and as the characters develop the first impression of them is slowly turned on its head."
2,"Great literature, I'm told","I did not enjoy the writing style at all. Book club member selected it, fewer than half of us were able to read it."
2,The Good Soldier,"~I found the book quite puzzling especially the character of the narrator which was cold and lacking in emotion. I wondered about the point of the narrator. The book was like a flow of consciousness and some sections had to be reread to try to get any meaning or sense. Here and there some wry humour, and some of the language was beautfiful though not always rational or clear. At times it all seemed chaotic."
4,likable,"I don't know why I liked this so much. The characters are all selfish unsympathetic twits. They don't really do anything dramatic, and yet I could not put it down.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick"
4,"Excellent, classic oldies",Obviously the previous reviewer is far too young to remember Eric Burdon and The Animals. If you can get this CD...don't pass it up. There is some really great stuff here. Considering this material dates back to mid- to late- 60's the quality is awesome.
3,Heading up,"3 1/2Soultrane is another worthy addition to the venerable saxophone player's pre-immolation phase, offering something not quite old-school compelling as BT, but still packed with enough melodic soloing to require archival commitment. For fans a more unhinged sound this Trane was beginning to roll towards, the album closer alone makes purchasing important."
4,Pure,This is GF's follow up to the Slavestate ep and I'm happyto report it's a better one. Pure doesn't hold a candleto Streetcleaner- which is considered to some their finest hour.This cd shreads with melancholy bleakness that few bandscould tap into. The songs are like dirges into the humanpsyche- with cold and mechanical precision. The bleak harshfeedback ridden guitar tone is still there accompanyingthe wall of bass that has become a GF trademark. Elements ofexperimentation are apparent throughout the disc the good thing is it's the kind of experimenting I enjoy and less of the danceelements of Slavestate. GF seems to be a bit more open minded tohip hop elements without loosing it's brute force. A fine effert indeed.
4,There's a heartbreak beat playing all night long,"After three albums with more or less stiff and devastating music, ""Pure"" shows some progess in a very positive way. Featuring guitarist Robert Hampson (of disbanded psychedelic rockers Loop; his current band is Main), this album comes up with more varied and fluid songs, more intelligible vocals, and sometimes even clubby rhythms. Still, the machine beats are relentlessly hard and guitars are as dominating as always. Best tracks here are the aggressive ""Spite"", the title track, the more laid-back ""Baby blue eyes"", and probably the mega-work ""Pure II"". I can't tell you anything about the CD bonus tracks, because I'm an owner of the vinyl release. I found the accompanying ""Merciless EP"" even more interesting, containing studio outtakes, remixes, and previously unavailable songs from the ""Pure"" sessions. All in all, this is one of Godflesh's best albums."
3,Great For A Debut but.....,In my opinion their later albums are a lot more interesting and better for my taste. This is a great starting point for a band's debut but I do not agree with some reviewers that it is their masterpiece. I personally prefer Us and Them or Streetcleaner or the Messiah Ep
2,Not quite solidified,"Although in technique and efficiency this is a mature Godflesh effort, it misses the cohesion of mechanics and feeling that made earlier Godflesh great. The hypno-trance stylings and abrupt, brutally minimal beats are great but don't save the distracted focus of this work."
1,Dated dread,"1 1/2Going for decadently dilapidated, all i get is deathly dull with occasional pounding prowess and shrill sensation."
1,crap,the top is not level and is angled up so much so that close a couldn't ajust it out with my scope and just trashed it
2,expected more from oxo,I bought this peeler for slicing Parmesan cheese but it's not up to the job. The handle is comfortable and secure but the blade is too flimsy for really hard cheese. Parmesan slices come out rough and too thick.
5,Eisenstein has captured the elusive soul of Mexico!,Eisenstein's film crew pieced together this incomplete opus of the histroy and spirit of Mexico years after the great director's death. The result is a mixture of documentary and docu-drama that reflects the great Soviet filmmaker's unique sensibilities and dramatic stylings. The story of the film's genesis is the subject of several books on the art of Eisenstein's cinema. The film is presented in a collage of segments that delve under the masks and into the layers of the mysterious Mexican soul. The film is a must if you are a Mexicophile or just a film buff.
4,History of Mexico and Cold War Ideology,Great Black and White footage from 1930s Mexico in a documentary/historical form from an alternative ideological eye. A must for all Mexicophiles.
1,Haven' received it.,"Too bad, this was the reason for all of my order, but more then two months later I am still waiting for this dvd. I am waiting every day... but nothing."
5,This is Live 85 folks.. A+,I'm surprised that there aren't any more reviews on this.. Alcatrazz and this should be in everyone's collection...as well as the net 10 years footage you can grab.
4,Serenity.,"""Rivers"" seems to be one of those albums that grows on you every time you listen.It isn't really deep or ambitious - I don't think it tries to be. It's background music, something to put on while you're working or just relaxing, to calm you and clear your mind; I find it quite perfect to listen to when I'm writing, for example. It's not a must-have but I think it's well worth the price, and I'd recommend it for anyone feeling stressed or discordant. You'll simply feel a little better when you play it; not unlike Enya or early The Corrs but in a completely different way.For fifty minutes of serene ambience, I say hang the four dollars."
2,One Note Johnnies,"WOW - This album is proof that even if you like one song on a CD, it does NOT mean you'll like the rest of their stuff. These songs (except for ""Chasing Cars"" which I still like) are SO MONOTONOUS and unimaginatively played! In each song, not only are the lyrics repetitive, but the music consists of phrases that are intoned again and again, without much variation. The drummer rarely plays any fills, but just keeps playing the same beat over...and over... and over... It makes for a truly boring listening experience. The comparisons to Coldplay are valid on only the most superficial level."
5,Classic,"Well another Snow Patrol Cd and another piece of magic.This cd is just awesome.The Killer Cut on this disc is Chasing Cars..Very similar to Run but even better.If i had to be picky the cd is missing a huge out and out classic pop tune like Chocolate,But over all its a much better album than Final Straw.My fave tunes on this disc.You Could Be Happy a killer Ballad..Of course the future massive hit single Chasing Cars.And Your All I Have.So many great tracks but those are the ones that stand out for me.But buy this cd you wont regret it."
2,Mediocre...at best,"With the exception of 'Chasing Cars,' there is little originality or variety on this album. Final Straw is much better, and significantly less depressing. The entire album is slow moving and morose in mood. Perhaps I need to listen to it more, but I find myself wanting to turn it off almost everytime I pop it in."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I rarely purchase a CD without listening to the entire album first. I've been burned too many times. I thought I'd take a chance on Snow Patrol, based on the strength of their single, ""Chasing Cars"". That was a mistake.Is it just me, or did every other melody sound exactly like the one before it? The lyrics were repetitive and mediocre. I feel that good music should make you feel *something*. Listening to this, I felt NOTHING.Well that's not true. I felt disappointed and annoyed for having wasted my money on this CD."
1,below average for Snow Patrol,"I just gotta say that anybody who likes their early stuff and the Reindeer Section who says this album is good is being very forgiving. I listened to this album and just thought, ""These guys want to make a whole lot of money."" This is especially disappointing since they have had up to this point such an authentic sensiblity. Like another reviewer said, you can play this for your family, or in your car and not be disgusted... BUT, for Snow Patrol, this is below average. The packaging seems appropriate: vaguely artsy, but meaningless, just like the music. And I'm not saying the music is meaningless just to be mean. It really felt meaningless to me, which makes me kinda sad, coming from Snow Patrol. I feel betrayed, or at least that they betrayed themselves. That said, there are some songs I like here, but none that knock me out, like on all their other albums."
5,Good Music,"Most of the songs on Eyes Open are origional, good music. None of the tracks were especially bad. My favorites are Spitting Games, Chocolate, Run & Somewhere a clock is ticking."
2,Where's the beef?,"A tragic disappointment. This should've been called the We sold out album. There are several radio friendly tracks. Lightbody has obviously worked hard to lose his heavy accent and the end product is bland and sounds just like everyone else. There's nothing distinct about this album. There are a couple of pathetic attempts to recapture the mood of their previous album but they fall flat. Sadly, they still have great lyrics, but they lack emotion. If you like the earlier sounds of Snow Patrol, don't waste you're time on this generic trash. This isn't the indy Scottish alternative sound you expect."
2,Yawn,"Well, their guitars are in tune. That's about all I can say about this creatively dull CD. It has all the syrup but none of quirk of Coldplay whom they seem to be emulating. It might be endearing if it wasn't so boring. I found myself yelling at the car stereo on track 10 ""open your damn eyes already!"" The one bright spot was 'Set The Fire To The Third Bar'at least it had some soul. The lyrics are probably the worst part except for the music - haven't these guys ever heard of a lead guitar? Seriously, I am majorly disappointed considering how impressed I was by an acoustic version of 'Chocolate' I heard on a local radio station. Gotta Go - I've already wasted too much of my life on this... yawn... err, what was I talking about??? Doesn't matter, see ya."
4,I loved it - but that doesn't make it good...,"I somehow feel too biased to review this album... Snow Patrol and their music have meant so much to me for many years now, and I can't help but wonder if the fact that their early albums helped shape me as a person when I was younger makes me think this new album is the eighth wonder of the world without merit. Oh well. I loved it - granted, I caught myself comparing it to a Coldplay album on several occasions, though as far as I'm concerned, ""Eyes Open"" blows Coldplay out of the water. Gary Lightbody's lyrics are brilliant as always, and the duet with Wainwright was reminiscent of the Raindeer Section days. Then again, there I go projecting - Snow Patrol reminds me of too much for me to be objective. In short, this is a pointless review...I love this album. But I understand why others don't."
5,An all time favorite,Years later this band is still impressing me and making me want to wipe my iTunes to only include their music. This album will always have a special place in my hear and is even autographed by the band. If you are new to their music this is a great place to start!
5,Always good,"I am not a hard core music guy but I repeatedly find Snow Patrol produce awesome stuff. I guess I might be becoming biased but I can't find an album from them that I don't like. Loved it, still love it, in fact I think I will fire it up now."
4,Surprisingly affecting,"I've been resisting listening to these guys because ""Chasing Cars"" sounds like the product of every other tiresome emo band out there, but the rest of the CD is surprisingly lovely. Personally, I think comparing them to the loathsome Coldplay is damning with faint praise -- actually, they're closer to Crowded House in sensibility (ie, heartfelt instead of whiny, intelligent and thoughtful instead of cliched, etc.). I'm glad I overcame my prejudice and just listened, because they're definitely worth the effort."
3,It will grow on you,"This is the forth Snow Patrol CD and they deliver a good combination of tune and lyrics. It tends to be on the mellow side and the lyrics are of course about broken hearts and unrealized relationships with songs like ""You Could Be Happy"" and ""Make This Go On Forever"".The more you listen to the CD the more you will like (maybe) so it will grow on you. Some would say they are similar to Coldplay but I would say Snow Patrol is more on the poetic side which is why I like them.If you get a chance to go to one of their concerts I recommend it. They do put on a good show."
3,How nice,What a nice little album. I can't remember the name of a single track and frankly I can't remember anything much about it. Nice.Nice is the word. Nice album. Unoffensive. Undaring. Nice but not great. Have a cup of tea while listening to it. And a ginger snap.Someone please tell me Final Straw was better than this?
2,Adolescent pop shlock,"Could there be a more instantly forgettable group than Snow Patrol? I mean, let me guess -- you heard a couple of songs, they sounded cool, you bought the CD and played it a few times, and how often to you play it now? Ever? Mgawsh, they become so tiresome so quickly. You'll notice how fast even their hits get dropped from radio playlists? The DJs got bored too."
2,The scourge of coldplay,"This music annoys me. When I hear it I want to give it a good shaking. Those chugging guitar cliches, those renta climaxes, those sensitive words and pursed mouthed strangled deliveries all speak to me of the plague of Coldplay. Enough."
1,Highly Repetitive............Highly Annoying,I'm disappointed in this album. It actually got to be annoying listening to the same hooks and lyrics over and over again. I don't recommend it at all.
5,"An unbelievable surprise, and best album of 2006.","I only first heard Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" when I was browsing the charts on iTunes, and decided to download it. I'm not the biggest fan of radio anymore, and especially in the NYC area it's hard to find good radio stations anymore. I've recently discovered that ""Chasing Cars"" is being slaughtered on the air which is a shame. The song still remains amazing, but the biggest surprise on the album is ""Open Your Eyes"" which is by far the best on this album. It had a bit of a ""Coldplay - Fix You"" type buildup, but achieves this quite differently. I would definitely have to say that this is the album of the year, and I have heard plenty of other new albums besides this one, although I am not a huge radio listener. From beginning to end, this album is amazing. Don't hesitate to purchase it."
3,Not up to par,"Im not going to say Snow Patrol is horrible for making a more radiofriendly commercial sound, but this album is simply not very good. Snow Patrol continues with basically the same style but after enjoying the first 3 tracks on this album, I was left disappointed by the rest.Overall 2.6/5 - Get Final Straw first"
4,If you like Coldplay....,"Honestly, I joined BMG, again, and I picked up Hinder, Extream behavior, Blue october : folied and this one. THe first two didn't last long in my player. I knew the hits but I couldn't get into the rest.Not Eyes Open. I was into the fourth song before I realized, I'm listening and enjoying whole tracks first listen. Just put disk in and roll. It's an easy listen. Good mix of soft poetic stuff and upbeat stuff. No pop here."
2,What Happened?,"When I saw on Napster that Snow Patrol had a new release, I sat in front of the computer for an hour. Final Straw has to be one of the most perfect albums ever released, but this doesn't even sound like the same band (much less the same singer). Talk about generic, the opener ""You're all I have"" is so standard, with obvious lyrics and and the same 3 chords, you'd think 13 year olds would have written it in their garage. Nothing grabs you on this disc, and when it does, something goes horribly wrong. On ""Shut your eyes"" the spare guitar line reels you in, and the lyrics are intensely intimate; an entreaty only to you, the listener. Then the entire chorus of 20 people (not professional singers) enters the scene and ruins the mood. The rest is bland, bland, bland. ""It's beginning to get to me"" is a bright spot, though, but not enough to save this repetitive non-effort."
2,broken case,"I know that this may be the the fault of the shippers, but the case that the CD came in had a significant crack in it. The actual CD itself wasn't damaged, but it is still disappointing."
5,awesome,"This is one of the best albums of the year. ""Chasing Cars"" and ""Open your eyes"" are the two best songs on the album. If you are interested in another excellent Irish band, Bell X1 are excellent, same type of music that goes right to your heart."
4,no chance,"i like this group tey sometimes sound repticous but chasing cars,headlightson dark roads i like the most. i am a 60's music psych listener,but there are some groups after the 60's that are good. snow patrol are good."
3,chasing cars,"I have always loved ""Chasing Cars"" but the rest of the CD is rather slow and sleepy. I guess I expected a few upbeat or jazzy or different.........."
4,Great CD,I love it the songs have alot of meaning to them and you can listen to it over and over again. its mellow and beautiful.
4,Snow Patrol - The comfort of familiarity,"I really like this album, a good 3.5 star effort. I completely agree with previous reviewers that there isn't anything particularly groudbreaking or phenomenal going on here, but for me that's not necessarily a bad thing. I really enjoy the steady indie-pop sound and the vocals provided by Lightbody. The first time that I listened to this, I didn't feel incredibly impressed, yet I keep listening to it over and over again, and I guess that says more than anything else. There is something very comforting in the sound of ""Eyes Open"" and I imagine a lot of open window/sunroof drives this summer with this as the soundtrack.Personal favorites on this include ""You're All I Have"", ""Shut Your Eyes"", ""You Could Be Happy"", ""Make This Go On Forever"", ""Open Your Eyes"", and ""The Finish Line."""
3,"""eyes closed""","After all the hype,buzz and rave reviews surrounding snow patrol's ""final straw"",I decided to give their latest effort ""eyes open"" a try.What I find after having listened carefully to the album a few times is a sense of profound emptiness and dissapointment.The thing is,that despite the fact the songs are well crafted,nicely produced,and injected with a large dosis of melody and hooks,the album fails to grab you and move you.It's just too polished,commercial and by the numbers kind of a deal,which end up making it an instantly forgettable and uninspiring album.Don't get me wrong,it isn't all that bad either since it's got its fair share of good songs(namely:hands open,you're all I have,chasing cars & shut your eyes)and if you're into bands like U2,train,etc you may wanna consider buying this album.In all fairness though,Gary lightbody does have a nice voice and is a fine lyricist too,which is the only reason why I'm giving ""eyes open"" 3 stars.Enough said."
3,ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE... AND COMPLETELY BLAND,"First off, I need to say that I love Snow Patrol and I loved Final Straw- I couldn't stop listening to it! So, I was psyched to get this album... well,this album is NOTHING like Final Straw! In fact, it's like a step and a fall backwards for the band. The ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE... AND COMPLETELY BLAND. There is nothing memorable about Eyes Open...the lyrics are repetitive and the music almost downright put me to sleep. In fact, I got so bored of this album that I couldn't get through it the first time and then after several attempts I made it through but even then it felt like a real letdown. What happened between this outing and Final Straw will forever be a mystery to me...that being said, save your money because this effort simply isn't worth it."
3,What Happened to the Second Half of the Album?,"I like Snow Patrol a lot. Final Straw is one of the best albums put out in the last couple of years, that much is for sure. I was pretty excited this summer when Eyes Open was coming out. I had heard ""You're All I Have"" getting some airplay and was pretty psyched to hear the whole album. Then I bought it. The first six tracks: Spectacular. The second half of the album: Not so much. Maybe they should have just recorded the first six songs and made an EP. My opinion anyway."
4,Great CD,Snow Patrol has a great sound. Eyes Open in particular is mellow with peaks of high energy. It's great to sing along to or just have on in the background.
5,Set the Fire to the Third Bar,"Set the Fire to the Third Bar is the winner in a walk for best track of the year. I really can't emphasize enough how much you should download this song immediately.The rest of the album is quite good, also, but that song is just lovely."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"I don't mind this album. It's got some PRETTY good songs, but it doesn't compare to Final Straw in the least.Final Straw just transported me to another musical plateau. I guess you could call it a concept album in a way. It did tell a story about a relationship from start to finish & it was BRILIANT. The whole thing was just a rollercoaster ride of emotions & feelings.Eyes open just sounds to me like the same old stuff you hear from other bands. I find little originality in it. Lightbody even sounds like he's bored while he's singing these songs.Very disappointing. It's beginning to seem to me like they took the commercial route maybe due to management's advice, to gain more exposure than ""Final Straw"" did with the typical results. The new album did gain wider exposure & sales, but it's ORDINARY. C'mon guys, you can do so much better."
2,Ugh....the disappointment,"Well, I will keep this brief. I usually would not write one of these, but I feel like I may be able to help someone out. If you loved Final Straw, chances are you will be shocked how this album is NOTHING like that one. I was highly anticipating this new album, ran out to get it on the 9th....after trying to see the bright spots in the album for some time, I have to say there really aren't any. The whole thing is bland. Where are all the great lyrics and sounds I know they can create? Here's hoping they get it right on the next album."
3,Eyes Open-A Pretty Good CD,"This cd is a pretty good cd. Overall this cd is not as good as Final Straw. Final Straw is a cd with most all of the songs being fairly good. Eyes Open has four great tracks 1,2,3,&5. I would say some of the previously listed tracks are probably better than any single song on the Final Straw. The rest of the cd is decent but really isn't great or timeless. If you want a good cd to get a taste of Snow Patrol get Final Straw, it is a good timeless cd that might take you a little bit to get into, but after you listen to it a few times you get addicted to it."
4,Snow Patrol - Eyes Open,"I really like this cd a lot but some of my friends are not as crazy about it. The first 3 songs a excellent but it does tend to get pretty mellow into the album. Still, I have really enjoyed it!"
4,Mellow-out music,"I spend a lot of time in front of a computer each day. Frequently, the time I spend with my computer is intensely stressful. The best method I found to address the stress is to listen to music, generally the less obtrusive the better. For a long time I used the Garden State soundtrack for my mellow-out music. Now that I have ""Eyes Open"", I have found a new favorite mellow-out disc. The lyrics are great, and although the songs can make great ""wallpaper"" I also like them for their own merits."
3,Interesting & Different,"I am someone who's musical taste is all over the place. I like this, and will follow them in the future. Cool stuff."
5,excellent CD,I love this group and the CD is excellent. I listen to it all of the time and it has made me want to buy more of their music. I am also going to try and get to one of their live shows.
3,"Too much history, not enough Dr. Martens ...","I am a huge fan of Dr. Martens, the made in England kind, not much experience wih the made in China manufacturing. I thought this book was going to explain how the shoes are made, why they last so long, etc. It isn't exactly what I got.The book mainly focuses on pop culture from the 60's till today, especially in the realm of music and what bands wear what. If I wanted a book on Brit pop and pop culture in general I could have bought that.The book DOES have some nice pictures to leaf through. The book also makes no mention of movIng the majority of their manufacturing to other countries. This may be because the book was published in 2003 when they began to make most of their shoes in China and the like or because the author wanted to avoid the topic altogether. You can draw your own conclusions.Not a bad read if you pick it up cheap, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
4,Mixed bag,"If you are a Tom Petty fan, you'll want this DVD as a part of your collection. The audio was clean and punchy, but the video wasn't always in sync and was distracting. Overall, the DVD had great atmostphere, partially due to backstage cutaways of the production crew. Overall, the image was very clean and, except for the audio/video sync problems, the concert was edited nicely."
3,an injustice,"Tom Petty is one of the best ever. People leave his shows awestruck. A film of a concert should make you feel as if you were there, as part of the audience. It should not make you feel as though your head were a ping pong ball being bounced about at two-second intervals by nine different cameramen, none of whom seem to be able to get a decent view. Why oh why must the filmmakers try to upstage the band when they are making these things? It never, ever works. To the powers that be: Please, please, please release Tom Petty's Pack Up The Plantation film on DVD. It is a wonderful perfomance and a much better film than this one. And next time you get ready to film a concert, watch The Last Waltz to get an idea of how it should be done."
3,"Good show, band rocked but...","Heavy emphasis on his Echo material and there were some glaring omissions from his hits. I also would have preferred a rocking (rather than acoustic) version of ""Even The Losers"". Still they rocked hard and played a good variety from each period of his career. Howie Epstein died in 2003 (2-3 years after this gig) but he looked frail and drawn even in this performance."
2,No Bass,"There is absolute no bass in the sound mix! I pumped up my sub woofer to try to compensate, but the bass drum got too loud. I moved the low pass filter towards 250 Hz, but that didn't really help. Hey, if you play bass and you want to JAM with Tom, this this is your video because you can plug into your amp and jump right in. I'm not bashing the performance, just the sound engineer's mix."
3,Could Have Been Better,The selection of songs are very good and the 5.1 is alittle above average. This dvd is in widescreen only and in this format I thought it was done poorly. At times Tom's head was cut off creating a distraction. Also the image was blurred throughout with too much color saturation. For the most part though the performance made the disc enjoyable. You can turn off the tv and listen to good rock & roll when you tire of watching the video.
1,Bad DVD,"I like Tom Petty but this DVD is bad. I have an HDTV set, but the DVD is formated with the black bars on the top & bottom. Why??? It makes it look like your viewing the concert through a slit. Poor editing too. Fast moving close ups reck the concert feel. The audio is bad also. I have a 7.1 surround sound setup and this audio just sounds bad. Save your money. Don't buy this. There is a reason why it's cheap ..."
2,Track Listing,"I'm interested to buy this DVD. But before I do, I'd like to know the Audio Encoding (is this DD 5.1 or DTS?)and the complete track/chapter listing.Thank you,aranleaf"
1,Boring,"Not what I expected after seeing them perform live in 2005. Boring, on stage performance on this disc. Don't buy this one."
2,"BAD, BAD, EDITING!","I JUST FINISHED VIEWING THIS DVD. SEVERAL THINGS COME TO MIND. FIRST, OVER HALF OF THE CAMERA SHOTS ,IN THIS DVD , START AS ""OUT OF FOCUS"" THEN FADE INTO FOCUS SLIGHTLY. THE CAMERAS JUMP AROUND AS IF THE EDITOR HAD JUST DRANK ABOUT 50 CUPS OF COFFEE BEFOR ENTERING THE EDIT ROOM.I DON'T THINK THERE IS 1 CAMERA SHOT THATS STAYS ON THE SUBJECT FOR MORE THAN 5 SECONDS. VERY HARD TO WATCH. SECONDLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF FILL SHOTS. EVERYTHING FROM THE BASS PLAYERS BOOTS TO THE BACKS OF PEOPLE OUT OF FOCUS AND TOTALLY OUT OF FOCUS SHOTS OF WHAT I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURPRISED TOM PETTY SIGNED OFF ON THIS PROJECT AS BAD AS IT IS.TOM AND THE BAND PLAYED THEIR COLLECTIVE BUTTS OFF ONLY TO BE RUINED BY BAD, BAD, EDITING!"
4,Addition to previous review.,"Aspect ratio was stated as full screen by Amazon. My DVD is in wide-screen. Also, there are no subtitles, as in words to the songs. For those of us that know them, that is fine. For those that don't ? Come on Tom. Give us a DVD from your concert at Pine Knob in June. That was quite honestly the best concert I have ever attended. I stood up for over two hours because everyone, (pavillion or lawn) was up. This was my sixteen year old son's first concert and he came home hoarse. I told him that it was all downhill from here. Come on, Tom. You can do better."
1,A disappointment!,"I'll make this quick... Remember the ""Pack Up The Plantation"" tape from the mid-80's? Great show. Amazing energy from the band, excellent setlist, and TP in his prime. Plus it was energetically directed, with great shots of all the band members, back up singers, etc...One of the best concert videos ever. Compared to that, and many other live concerts on the market, this one is a drag. Overall it's a lackluster performance, the camerawork, editing, and overall pace of the production is sluggish. The greatest insult is the cutaways of individual bandmembers that are not even in sync with the soundtrack. Tht tells me that this show was undershot, and consequently over edited. Essentially sucking the life out of what was probably a good show in person, but feels amd looks tepid on DVD. One highlight: The inclusion of ""Listen to Her Heart"". Verdict: This one's only for hardcore fans."
3,Tom Petty High Grass Dogs,"All Tom Petty things are great, but this wasnt my favorite. Its good, but not the best Ive seen. Still worth buying if youre a big Tom Petty fan like I am, but I'd go for the Runnin Down A Dream video if you want something really cool from Tom Petty. This video was kind of different because it would show random things happening back stage while the concert is going on, and I think that detracted from the concert. Still great songs and great performance by Tom & The Heartbreakers though."
4,Our friend GOD tells it like it is!,"A light-headed description of our friend GOD. Almost all of him! This book'll make you think, make you laugh yourself to tears, make you wish it never ends. Will bring something new everytime you read it over and over and over again."
3,a stage in the career,"""Air Pocket"" was released seven years after ""Cosmic Furnace."" Mr Powell continued to have mastery of electronic music. ""Air Pocket"" was otherwise much different. The drum line dominates, whether for disco, funk, or majestic rock. Songs fit the time frame for radio play. That dictated the amount of development of musical themes. Mr Powell benefited from, and was influenced by, association with Todd Rundgren. The previous album was instrumental, this one had vocals. The vocal harmonies were good, the lyrics set scenes efficiently. The last cut was a surf music classic, with a disco beat in the bridge."
4,A Retro Keyboard Essential,"For those who enjoy keyboard-based, mostly instrumental recordings from the past, Roger Powell is a name to which one needs to pay attention. Along with LarryFast (Synergy) and Dick Hyman (MOOG), Powell's music was certainly cutting-edge material for the time (back when it was called""synthesizer music""), and stillholds up well today. My standouttrack from AIR POCKET is ""EmergencySplashdown"", but all are excellent.The fact that this record has neverbeen released domestically on CDis a shame; even moreso is the unavailability of Roger Powell'sincredible COSMIC FURNACE, whichhas been tops on my CD want listfor many years. I believe it was onthe Cotillion/Capricorn label, andhope that someone in a position toright this wrong reads this review.In short: if you love modern keyboard music, you need AIRPOCKET."
5,good kick-back music,"I first heard this album(LP) back in the late 70's.I was just starting to understand my musical tastes,and the music just seemed to flow from one song to another.It made you think about the music and what it ment to the listener.Not just what the words were trying to convey."
1,Contains BPA/ Bishpenol A I'm Returning All Avent Products!,"Just wanted to inform all parents out there that this product contains BPA/ Bisphenol A. I returned mine. Pacifiers,bottles,breast pumps can have BPA in them as well such as the AVENT products that I returned. I then decided to go with Born Free bottles and sterilizer,Soothie pacifier and the Gerber Nuk pacifiers,and Medela pump. All their products are BPA Free. You do the research and decide if you will buy or continue to use their products. I've already written the President, my senators, and Oprah. Hopefully together we can keep our children safe."
2,ALWAYS THE WRONG COLOUR,"SECOND TIME THAT COMES PINK, MY BABY IS A BOY!!!!AND I SENT PREVIOUS EMAILS!!!CAN'T RETURN..."
5,Romantic Fun,"I loved this movie. Dennis Quaid and Julia Roberts were both engaging in their roles. Lots of energy and funny twists to the age old love story. Gena Rowlands, Robert Duvall and Kyra Sedgewick were fabulous and captured the old fashioned and new blood of the southern family. Will leave you with a smile on your face."
3,a marriage on the rocks,"I'm a real Kyra Sedgwick fan, but this movie really doesn't do any of the actors a good turn. The plot is kind of silly about a rich girl's marriage to of all things a bankerwhile they are training horses for a riding show.Just a pretty strange movie where father certainly doesn't know best.I think Randy Quad could have done as good as Dennis Quaid in this roleand might have been more believable?"
3,Movie Review,"This movie is wonderful. I love Julia Roberts character. It is an older movie, but I can always find the older ones on Amazon.com. Thanks!"
5,Truly Something To Talk About !!!,Julia Roberst does it again. They couldn't have got anybody better to play her sister than the sassy Kyra Sedgwick!!
3,Entertaining movie,"I liked this movie and found it entertaining. I especially love the dancing parts and the comment made by Julia Roberts in the movie. ""That's comes from years of being bred to have low expectations."""
4,a look at relationships,I liked this movie alot prehaps because I liked the actors but also because it deals with some real issues in not only marriages but also families. Julia Roberts does a great job as a wife who has been cheated on and as she struggles to deal with the fall-out from this she also has to work on family relationships. The movie does have some colorful language and deals with some serious subject matter so it does deserve the R rating that it has.
4,entertaining stars,"this was julia's return to being julia and it's a pleasure to watch. amusing lines, flowing story, great acting.best move - casting kyra sedgewick and julia roberts as sisters. brilliant!"
1,Warner Brothers in MGM and Universal and CBS/Paramount territory,"This review is not for the film, It is for the DVD. And since we are talking about a DVD here the DVD itself falls, and should fall, within the purview of any review.There is no excuse for putting an abridged version of the film in 1:13:1 and the original aspect ratio of 1:85:1 version on the film on different sides of a single disc. Put them on the same side. Or better yet stick the abridged version where the sun doesn't shine. That would save good old WB from accepting a return of a disc that has scratches on it like mine because it is two sided. A pox on the WB."
3,Enjoyable,I love the movie there was a scrach in the dvd where it stops. The storie line in this video is outstanding and you can relate to it very well.
4,An enjoyable and entertaining film,"Curl up and enjoy this movie. It is funny, sad, interesting and most of all enjoyable. I disagree with the person who said that the husband and wife spontaneously dance and then live happily ever after. Did we watch the same movie? The wife (Julia Roberts) then goes back to school and her husband begins courting her. Dating, not back to move in and live happily ever after."
2,Yawn.,"Found this to be a very disappointing ""chick flick"". Your wife or date mightlove it, but you'll fall asleep."
2,very average,this film is lacking solid writing and experiences many moments of Lapse timing.also Julia ROberts&Dennis Quaid never quite click.it has some moments but nothing but a average film all the way around.
2,Foul language throughout.,"""Something To Talk About"" was only a fair movie in my estimation. By taking out cuss words such as ""GD"", ""F"", as well as the infidelity talk and its action and it became better, not wonderful, but better."
2,An average movie!,"The story is average. If you have seen any other love story,then you have already seen it! The only problem are lots of swearing! Other than that if you like Dennis Quaid or Julia Roberts then you met like this movie!"
2,Something to Talk About,"Too much gratuitous, totally unnecessary profanity for me. The movie has a nice family story which would far better have been served without all the profanity, which is typical of movies now. It's much better to view it on cable, where they cut out most of the profanity. I will be passing on this DVD."
2,don't know what you mean,This is the third time I have been asked to review this product and each time I said that it was good and everything about it was good. Catherine Bevers It should be five stars not two as indicated on this review.
3,Not as funny as I had hoped,"A friend told me this was a really funny movie. I did not agree. Yes, there were some funny moments, but in general I thought it was dramatic, and sad. Some of the characters were rather pathetic -- but intended to be that way, I suppose. Still, pathetic is not funny. I was not sorry I watched it for I love Dennis Quaid and Julia Roberts. But this was definitely not their best. My favorite thing about the movie was watching the horses!"
1,The book received simply is missing all the formulas that should be there...,"Looks like their printing facility, equipment, or most likely the rendering software simply failed to interpret and reproduce on paper the formulas that should be present... It is an aberration, never saw anything like that before..."
1,Not a good choice,"I don't know if it's the ""worst ever"", but it contains serious errors. Some are possibly typos, but the majority are wrong math, wrong analysis or--worst of all--wrong concept. A disaster for the beginning student.See for example the solutions to example Free-Response Questions 2(b) and 3(b) given on page 151."
3,HAS NO PUNCH,"This is not a bad cd, but it's kind of weak it reminds me of real old blues. Kim Wilson's harp is fair, and the guitar is not that great, but it is worth a listen. It is real slow throughout but I guess it depends on what type of blues you like. Myself I like all kinds of blues, with this one there is just not really anything that catches your ear."
4,Easy to mount and very well built,The product is very easy to install and very well built... The instructions are easy and everything you need to install it is right there in the box...
2,"Excellent Quality, BUT ...","OxoSpoonReview (#59291)The quality is superb, the kind that's a pleasure to own, BUT:Imo, it is too large for the average user, AND:The ergonomics are off-mark: used at normal height (stovetop) the angle of the bowl to the shaft is completely wrong. But if you use it a mid-thigh or knee level, it's exactly right.Fortunately, the shaft is not so difficult to bend, so now the angle is right. But it's still too big (for me), can't figure a way to fix that.Note: this applies also to #59191"
4,"A good workout, but not the core exercises","A fan of Jennifer Kries' ""The Method"" series of tapes, I bought this DVD without knowing much more than what was described on the cover. It does not include the abdominal and core strengthening exercises that are the foundation of Pilates. However, there are some traditional Pilates moves on this DVD. It is divided into 3 segments, upper body strenthening, lower body strengthening, and stretching, each about 20 minutes long. The upper body segment is done with light weights and is very similar to part of her ""The Method Precision Sculpting"" video. I found all 3 segments challenging and I feel I will benefit from these exercises. I like having this on DVD so that I can choose which segment to do without having to rewind or fast-forward a tape. Also, the lower body section offers a choice of viewing from 3 different camera angles. The package says there is also an audio option to have music only, but I have not been able to find this on the disc."
3,Not quite what I expected ...,"After learning the Pilates matwork from a book, I've been doing the exercises for several months already. I expected this DVD to incorporate more of the matwork than it did. The content actually included more yoga-inspired moves than Pilates. It really wasn't what I expected and I'm rather disappointed that it's being marketed as ""Precision Pilates."""
2,Not Pilates.....,"This is not a bad DVD.. it actually has 3 decent workouts... BUT the reason I'm giving it only two stars is because I felt very misled by it... The title Precision Pilates would obviously lead the buyer to assume it is a purely ""pilates"" workout. There is not one exercise here that is in the Pilates matwork routine. The moves are all Yoga based with a Pliates influence.I bought this DVD as a supplement to the Pilates book by Brooke Siler... and was highly disappointed.. ! I would definitley watch this DVD before purchasing it, if possible.. it may provide you with a good workout.. but if its true Pilates matwork exercises you are looking for.. that is NOT what you will find here..."
4,I love this video!,"This is a really good video that I wish would come out on dvd! The stretching portion is very relaxing and useful. As a runner, I sometimes do not focus very much on my stretching. I appreciate this component.Compared to other videos in this series, I wish there was more focus on ab work. Obviously, she incorporates it into all segments, but it would be nice to have a separate segment."
2,Not for beginners,"I agree with everything the reviewer from Tucson, AZ United States dated June 24, 2001 said. That write-up is exactly correct."
1,Too much breast,"The workout is good and she's a great instructor. I appreciate that she's not spiritual about the yoga too.But, I can't play it since I have 2 children. Her top is cut so low it's a wonder her breasts don't flop out! My family and I get exposed enough in public. I don't need it during my exercising. I would have bought her other workouts but I suspect she has the same wardrobe problems in those also, too bad."
1,junk,"Don't waste your money on any of the Disney Fairies toys. We bought our girls the whole collection for Christmas and pieces have been breaking right and left during the two weeks since. My girls aren't rough by any means, yet legs fall off and can't be repaired even with glue, wings crack and hair knots. We will never buy our kids toys like this again. It's back to the educational toy department next Christmas!"
4,Great book if used in conjunction with other review material,"I had a different experience from most of these reviewers. The book was a broad overview of the content knowledge one needs to pass the subtests. The sample tests were also helpful. I used the book along with review material in order to get a more detailed review. I passed all three subtests the first time around on the same day...so I'd recommend it. I do, however, hear there is a new CSET test prep book that may be better than this one."
2,"You'd do better to use a AP, SAT, or ACT Prep book...","Not only did I get the book, but I took the lame course. Fisher (the second author) so much as admited that his book is the best because it is the only CSET book currently available. Both the book and the course fall far short of the material covered on the actual exam. I am a past MSAT taker and 1st time passer-- I unfortunately have the pleasure of having my MSAT score not count due to new CA regulations, and was confident that the information required for CSET success was less than that required for MSAT due to the oversimplifications in the Bobrow and Fisher text and course.Should I have to take the test again I will utilize more specific content materials. Perhaps, AP course materials are better suited to study?Good luck. I hope you find a better study guide than this one. Please, don't buy this book."
1,TeachingSolutions is a SCAM,"Sadly I made the same mistake a couple of the other reviewers did and purchased there product. To start with the web site shows a picture of a book, CD rom and a Cassette tape. What you get is a PDF file that you then have to print out. The extra coaching they promote is also a joke. It costs you $20 bucks but what you get is a Email address that you can send questions to. Unless you have money to flush down the toilet dont bother with they product."
4,It Rounded Out My Previous Knowledge,"I found the book good in that it was a good general review of the topics. If you have a lot of study time and want to absorb a lot of info, do study this book. I didn't have so much time before my exam, but it did help. The Teaching Solutions www.cateachingsolutions.com program brought me up to speed and made a difference. I passed thank god and I owe that to both of the aforementioned products."
3,Just okay for preparation,"I have not taken the CSET yet, so I cannot say that this book helped me pass (or fail) the tests. It does seem to be helpful in understanding the format of the test and providing sample questions, however that can all be found on the CSET website. I found enough misinformation in the book to decide not to read through the entire thing, as I don't want to get to the test, see a familiar question, and then answer it wrong because the answer from this particular book had been wrong. I am banking on my prior knowledge to get me through the CSET (hopefully people only stress about this test because it is imperative to becoming a teacher, not because of the difficulty of the content). Good luck to everybody out there!"
2,Weak study guide - Could Be Better,"I don't know what all the hype is about, especially from the poster above. The book is an abbreviated, outline version of what you need to know.You HAVE to do your own studying, and look into buying other books (4th, 5th Graders, Boosalis, etc). I too was SHOCKED when I first purchased this book and flipped through the pages. The stuff you need to know is nowhere near the exam itself, not to mention that Cliffs test itself are a total flop ..."
2,Same material as previous MSAT book... and typos,"I was given this book as part of a test prep class, and had to supplement its contents with extensive outside reading -- consider the Hirsch books, the ""Everything You Need to Know About..."" series from Scholastic, online encyclopedias, and the Usborne published books to up your knowledge.Also, I discovered by accident that much of this book is copied VERBATIM from the Bobrow-published MSAT study guide. Even though the test is supposedly different, and the science supposedly easier, this book is almost identical to the MSAT test prep book. Which makes you wonder why they couldn't fix the numreous typos between publications...Haven't taken the CSET yet, but I know I wouldn't feel prepared relying on this book alone."
3,It's not that bad...,"I didn't find this book as bad as other reviewers have. The math and science portions were all I needed to pass that section of the CSET. The practice tests, item explanations, and strategies are useful. The history sections are admittedly very lean, but they really can't be more than content outlines, and they serve that purpose well. I feel it's a good overview, but certainly not everything one needs to pass the test. Beware: it's got mistakes, including the name of the test (it's not the California Subject Examination Test, it's the California Subject Examinations for Teachers) and test content (like the order of the cell stage drawings on p. 98)."
2,OH PLEASE HELP!,"This has been a disappointing year! I now have to take the tests again. I DID NOT PASS. I don't find it clear and helpful. I truly wish there were more options and taking a class is not an option. So, if you buy it...I wish you well."
3,Is This Best They Can Do To Prepare You for the CSET?,"This is a good book overall, but so much text about so much potential CSET content. These things are killing my brain and pockets. And they have nothing to do with your teaching ability. ~exhale~ sorry, had to vent. I also used a program by CA teachers which provides a concise and brief cross-section of real CSET content at cateachingsolutions.com. This stuff at Teaching Solutions was more to the point and closely reflected what I saw on the CSET. I would also recommend the CSET classes if you have a few weekends of free time."
1,What a disappointment and waste of money,"This book was the biggest disappointment ever. Not only is the CSET a stupid test to begin with but this book does everything but give you an idea of what to expect on the test. I walked into the test confident and feeling very well prepared, when I left I knew I was doomed! Do everything you can to avoid buying this book!"
2,Same material as OLD MSAT,"The Cliff's Notes covered the basic material of the new CSET, but I thought it wasn't as thorough as it should of been. The CSET test had questions that were not covered on this book. The route I took was to read some of Hirsch's work. It helped out more than the Cliff's. Also if you are a new CSET test taker, don't purchase any of the products from teaching solutions. I just read about it on the internet that it is a scam and a bogus product. I had just got mine, and I could tell you to save your money. It's a no go.Hirsch's book is probably the best bet to go."
3,An outline of what you can expect,"Most negative reviewers found this book lacking because it did not contain all the information found on the CSET - and it doesn't. There is no way one book can cover American history, world history, English, geometry, P.E., science, dance, etc., etc., etc... What it does do is give a good outline. Do not plan on using this book as a ""bible"". Use it as a good starting point and if you lack knowledge in any of the subjects you'll just have to spend a bit of time in the library.(When one buys a Cliffs book there is the expectation that one is buying a short cut (i.e. the answers). Don't expect that from this book.)"
2,Not good condition,"The book had writing on almost every page, AND there was pink highlighter EVERYWHERE! The book was not even close to being in good condition, or fair, or even acceptable."
2,Senior Elderly Sitting Exercises,"This was not at all suitible for my elderly mother, and would not recommend it as such. Seniors perhaps but not the 'ELDERLY' who need somthing simpler and easier to follow."
1,Yuk! We didn't like this one at all.,"I got this for an 88-year-old friend, but wish I'd been able to watch a preview first. The demonstrator keeps a weird, fake-looking grin the whole time she's doing the exercises, and the audio seems to be dubbed in. We hated the music.There are definitely more appealing seated exercise videos available. Be sure to find a site where you can watch a preview before ordering."
3,Senior Exercise DVD Senior,I didn't care for it. The model was too impersonal. Just wasn't what I wanted. The exercises were not that intense.
3,Great For Older Beginners,I have been a fitness instructor for 30+ years and I now teach strictly seniors. This video is great for older (65+) beginners. It is easy to follow and the exercise is not strenuous. The relaxation at the end is good for those who need to learn how to relax. The only thing I did not like about the video is that it was poorly produced. The instructor looks like an ex-porn star with very old sneakers. She is a very bad example for skin health with her very dark tan. I would think that the producer would have taken her appearance into consideration. Just my opinion.........
4,great for those with limited mobility,"I think this video is great for my grandparents! My grandma really enjoyed it, and so did I."
2,Tacky,"The exercises are pretty good but Miss ""Sunshine"" leaves a lot to be desired. I bought this for my 90-year-old mom who needs chair exercise to keep osteoporosis at bay. She doesn't mind doing the exercises, but the faky smile ""Sunshine,"" dressed way too young and scantily for her age, drives Mom nuts (me, too). It also makes Mom mad that it doesn't look like Sunshine is really doing what she instructs, like when she talks about deep breathing, she doesn't do it. I'd like to find an exercise video with someone a little more believable."
2,Not What I Expected,"I previously wrote a review for this product, and now it's not listed. I purchased this DVD for my grandparents based on the rave reviews from this site, but now I'm beginning to think that only the rave reviews are posted & the not so great reviews (e.g., my previous review) are deleted.I was very much disappointed with this DVD. The production quality was very poor (complete with spelling errors) and there were very few exercises. The exercises were good, however the reps were much too fast for older individuals. There are better senior exercise DVD's out there, and I would not recommend this one."
1,No precautions,I was looking for an additional chair exercise video and was very disappointed with this DVD. It was do this then do that. No mention is made of alterations to use if an exercise caused pain or could not be done by the viewer. It's tagged for rehab & physical therapy but again no explanation of what should/should not be done if you've had joint surgery or replacement. I would not recommend anyone bother purchasing this DVD.
4,good workout for elderly,I work with the elderly and bought this for them. I had to warn them to try to ignore the very odd fake smile of the lady and the fact that she is wearing a crop shirt which to the elderly this is not appropriate at all. But besides that the exercises are very good. They were all able to follow along and do the exercises. Which are very good for them.
4,Easy Chair Exercises CD Sunshine from Amazon,"Purchased this CD from Amazon. It is new as described. Arrived in great condition. Exercises great for seated participation. The model is dressed in skimpy shorts and keeps a constant robatic smile. Overlooking that, the exercises are perfect for flexibility. It includeds exercises for the whole body. The instructions are easy to follow and understand. Good CD."
2,Extremely tame,"A very tame collection of scenes involving Miho Nomoto: her in her underwear, her naked in bed, her naked running on the beach, etc. There is very little frontal nudity in this video, and not much eroticism either."
3,"Bypass this thing, at all costs!!","Not that the music isn't great! That's hardly the issue! The music deserves 4 stars alone, at the very least! Even though the general consensus is that the record isn't good because it has a healthy amount of editing/remixing, that's not the issue either. My point is: this record is not a fair representation of live Rainbow: it is WAY too short! My advise: go get either ""Live in Germany 76"" or ""Live in Munich 1977"". They both include Rainbow's full live sets from those tours at a moderate price. Most Rainbow scholars will tell you that the definitive Rainbow lineup is the one that recorded and toured for ""Rising"". While I do not entirely agree with that, I must say that, if you like Rainbow, you HAVE TO listen the live rendition of ""Stargazer""...otherwise, you would be missing out..."
1,To A Misled US Reviewer,"Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising', it came from the tour for the 'Rising' LP. It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to ""Beat the boots"". Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the ""jam-happy"" years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try ""Live In Germany '76"", which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!"
2,Skip This One,"Rainbow's 'On Stage' is to me one of the weakest live alnums I've ever heard, especially cosidering it comes from the era when great live albums were plentiful. First off the mixing is dreadful;Blackmore's guitar is drowned out by the keyboards throughout. It also suffers from the same problem as Deep Purple's equally boring 'Made In Japan',possibly one of the most overrated live albums ever, in that the long extended versions of the tunes just meander, not going anywhere. If you want the line-up with Dio,stick with the superior studio albums. I think the were much better and more concise with Graham Bonnet and Joe Lynn Turner. This one's for completists only."
4,Catch the Rainbow wherever you can...,"On Stage is a decent, if not transcendant, live album: THEE definitive lineup of Blackmore-Dio-Powell-Bain-Carey caught at the end of a long tour and slightly tired. There are some magical moments, like Blackmore's extended blues solo (and tradeoffs with the keyboards), the way Dio starts singing ""Starstruck"" during the breakdown of ""Man on the Silver Mountain"" and the rest of the band picks up on it and jams, and of course ""Catch the Rainbow."" But the very fact that this is a single album is a disappointment; ""Mistreated"" pales compared to Mk. 3 (i.e. Coverdale-sung) versions (although Ronnie is a better all-around singer than David), and then there's the fact that the energy found on Live In Germany 1976 (recorded roughly three months earlier) is sadly lacking. Still, catch the original Rainbow on disc wherever you can. They had a musical alchemy matched only by Purple at their best, Sabbath at their best, early Priest, and maybe Uriah Heep."
5,Great Live Rainbow,"One of Rainbow's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
4,Memories of Rainbow,"Rainbow's live album, released in 1977, was one of my favorite vinyl records at the time. Hearing it now brings back why I loved the band so much...And why Blackmore is my favorite guitarist to this day."
4,"Not as good as ""Live in Germany""","Compared to Live in Germany, this comes accross as a bit all over the place and lacking professionalism. Even so it is worth having. Whilst it is indeed good to have an album from Rainbow's Dio era, given that we now have a choice with the ""Live in Germany"" album, I would urge others to go for that album rather than this one; obviously if you ahve the cash you can get both!"
4,Legendary...,"Rainbow live were more than a 'rock concert';they were a genuine mystical experience,yet unequaled by any other band.In other words,this is what'catching the rainbow'is all about...and a few beers,of course."
3,Quilt in a Day,"Wanting to learn the technique of Log Cabin quilting, I ordered this book which was recommended by a friend. It is okay but the building blocks of the quilt pattern from my brief overview focuses on the techique of fields & furrows which I don't particularly like. While the other techniques are mentioned, the diagrams & measurements are for fields & furrows. It is an okay book but I wish that it contained more patterns & diagrams."
1,Old Version in black and white,"this is an older version of the book. Because it is in black and white, it is hard to follow. I then purchased the newest version in color and it is so much better."
5,Make A Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern,"Thank you Eleanor! I knew next to nothing about quilting before purchasing this book. As a beginner, I needed something quick & easy to give me confidence and get me started. This book is superbly written for the beginner; simple, clear, & precise directions with color photos. From the shopping list to the 1,2,3 directions, this book a beginners must have. Even though I don't think a beginner can make this quilt in a day, I made my very first quilt (Lap Robe size) in two days."
5,Very explicit and easy to use,"This is the book I used to make my very first quilt. It takes you through all steps of making a quilt - buying fabric (all the measurements needed for a size are printed on one page), cutting fabric, and the assembly line method used for assembling the blocks is very easy to figure out and efficient - just make sure you sew straight! :)All of the instructions are very clear and the large amounts of pictures are especially helpful. I would highly recommend this to a beginner quilter.It may seem somewhat expensive since it is only one pattern, but the Quilt in a Day series is so user-friendly I find it well worth the price."
2,log cabin quilt book,I expected a regular book and this appeared like a copy with pages very light. It appeared to be printed and stapled together. Would not suggest to anyone else.Shipping was great.
5,Talk about fast!,"I did quilts out of this book and there are so fast to make it will make your head swim. Actually I was astonished at how fast they were to make. Easy,easy,easy. Fast gifts!"
5,Best book for beginners,"I started quilting about 18 months ago and needed a book that would provide exact details. I now recommend this book to anyone who wants to start quilting. Super easy, strait forward and fast. The book even tells you how much fabric you will need and provides recommendations on all of the various designs that you can create using the log-cabin block. Love it!"
5,Great used book!,"I purchased this book used, but you can hardly tell it!It is in great shape for a used book. I was very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks Amazon.com!"
5,Make a Quilt in a Day,"I met a quilter this summer who had this book, and turned me onto the Log Cabin quilt. I had been doing some triangle quilting, and found it very hard to match all those little corners. This is all straight pieces, and with this book you can really find many ways to put together the same quilt block for different effects."
5,"An excellent, simple to understand book","I just made my very first quilt using this book. It is exceptionally well written and illustrated. The fabric requirement measurements were very accurate. I especially like the ""assembly line"" process of quilt assembly. Ms. Burns makes quilt making easy and exciting!"
5,Quilt In-A-Day Pattern,"I haven't tried to make it yet, but it is the same as the old pattern I owned. So thank you very much."
5,Oldie but goodie!,"The pages of this book are a little yellowed with age, but still as good as new...can't wait to begin making quilts."
5,Love this book!,I received this book a couple of years ago as a gift when I first started quilting. It was only recently that I realized how easy this book is to follow. The step by step instructions have helped me so much in creating a number of log cabin quilts and it remains my favorite book for myself and for instructing others.Photos make it so easy to follow the directions and I still refer to it regularly.I highly recommend this book!
5,WHAT A GREAT HELP THIS BOOK HAS BEEN!,"I started as a complete beginner when I purchased this book. I have a sewing machine with which I am pretty familiar but had never attempted a quilt. After looking over this book I decided that it was simple enough that it could probably walk me thru the basics. This book is all I could have asked for. It started with the very, very basics like selecting your fabric, all the way thru to deciding how to quilt the top of the quilt. I didn't know that there were options to finishing it!! Eleanor Burns makes it so easy that she literally assumes you know nothing (good assumption in my case) and tells you step by step what pieces to sew together and in what order. Make a daunting issue very simple. I strongly suggest that you consider this book if you are unsure of yourself at any step in the process. She will help you gain your confidence and come out with a quilt that will make you proud."
3,diary of a crack addicts wife,"Was not as gripping as what i had hoped, though it was an insight into the mindset of an abused woman."
5,prime late 80's NYHC,"when I think of the late 1980's NY Hardcore scene, I think of classic albums like Sick Of It All ""Blood, Sweat, & No Tears"", Agnostic Front ""live at CBGB's"", and especially Killing Time ""Brightside"". not only is this a great album by itself, but Victory records re-issued this album a few years ago with a ton of bonus tracks including the ""Happy Hour"" e.p. and the original Raw Deal demo recordings making this an incredible slab of prime classic NYHC."
3,I like some of it...,"Well, don't be fooled by the amount of tracks on this album, because Killing Time has some pretty short songs. I honestly only liked about a third of the songs on this album, and despite how short they are, I still somewhat recommend this album. I kinda recommend this album because Killing Time has a sound all their own. Their instruments aren't great, and neither are their vocals or lyrics...but it comes together in a way that I like. Well...in a way that I kinda like, since I only liked several song from this album. Anyway, I'm still glad that I bought this album. Just listen to the song Brightside and try to tell me that it's not good :)"
4,THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR HARDCORE COLLECTION!,"This cd will take you back to what it is all about, the music. The songs are heavy and driving. This band will definatly get you moving."
4,great underrated hardcore band,"these guys are great they remind me of prong,sick of it all,rest in peices & leeway.great new york hard core nothin but reality and breakdowns."
2,Not worth the $$,"This is a nice piece, but definately NOT worth the money! It is NOT made of solid wood. Plus, full assembly is required and is time consuming."
3,Good and Bad,"The windscreen looks great, but doesn't fit as snug as the factory windscreen. There are some gaps along where the windscreen and the fairing meet."
2,Good Choice for the Reluctant Reader,"I purchased Snowbound Mystery because I was looking for an exciting book for a very young advanced reader, with age-appropriate content. The Boxcar Children series appeals to most children so I purchased Snowbound Mystery without realizing that it was a comic book format. The child was disappointed and so was I. This book would be a good choice for the reluctant reader; a child who is overwhelmed by the number of pages in a book and a lot of print. A child who loves to read will find this book a disappointment. I should have read the description more carefully."
3,I like this book but L'Amour has spoiled me!,"Brionne is a good western and an enjoyable read, but is simply not up to the standards L'Amour set for himself. The best part of his books is the unexpected twist that always comes in the climax. This time, I was dissapointed. The climax was spelled out through the whole book so there wasn't much of a surprise when it finally came.Don't get me wrong, though. I really liked the prairie fire scene, and the only reason I give this book 3 stars is the fact that L'Amour wrote many books that were much better. The fact that one of L'Amours worst books was still extremely enjoyable shows how far ahead of the competition he is. Kirby Jonas, Ralph Compton, Zane Grey and any other western writer you can name simply can't hold a candle to L'Amour. He is in a league of his own when it comes to westerns. Every one of his many, many legions of fans will attest to this fact."
4,TWO INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH TROUBLE BEHIND!,"This is a heart-warming, and a tear-shedding story that revolves around Brionne -the father- and his young but ready to learn only son his wife left behind! Brionne leaves all the hard memories behind and seek for a whole new peaceful life in some other spot of the land but the trouble come after which put Brionne in a difficult situation! May not be the best of L'Amour writings but it's surely nice, and will keep you reading till you reach the end of the story!"
3,A good old L'Amour story,"This was a typical L'Amour, and it's easy to use the word typical with a L'Amour because let's face it, they were all an awful lot alike. The book was pretty good. I liked the characters and all. But like most of L'Amour's stuff they lacked the emotion I've come to enjoy from other authors. Take Kirby Jonas. He's the guy people have started calling The New Louis L'Amour. It's pretty fitting, because he writes in a lot the same style. But his books have more emotion, and you get more involved with his characters. What I like about L'Amour is how clean his books are, and how he keeps down the swearing. But Kirby Jonas is the same there, too. I think L'AMour has some stiff competition on his tail!"
3,Not as Described,"The description says ""Dishwasher Safe"", but the packaging clearly states, ""DO NOT PUT IN THE DISHWASHER"". I purchased this particular one because it was one of the few that were able to be put in the dishwasher, but now I can't. I just don't feel comfortable hand washing anything that comes in contact with meat."
3,Great solid product except no dishwasher clean,"The biggest portion to choose meat tenderizer is whether the product can be sanitized with hot water in the dishwasher. So I chose this one based on the description that I could put it in dishwasher, but the tag on the product when I opened said different than I saw it online. No dishwasher. So I had to returned it and bought another stainless product which does not have any issue to put it in dishwasher. If anyone has no concern about the sanitizing it because of using it after putting some layers of wrap, this could be good buy."
1,Awful,"No empathy for the characters, no knowledge of horses or horse racing and the book was difficult to follow.Do not read this book if you love horses or horse racing. It has little to do with any of it and it is very obvious that Fern did not do much research into either."
2,Horse Knowledge??,"I agree with some of the other reviews.There is hardly any empathy for any of the characters, especially for one of the main characters at the end of the book. Oh, and horse knowledge? There is no way a Kentucky Derby would end as it did here. I don't want to give it away...but for starters, lets just say a horse does not cross over a finish line..but under a finish wire.The line of characters was also confusing, but I eventually figured it out.However if you are like me, a book with horses in it at all keeps me entertained."
4,Is this the end of the series?,"I liked this book, having read the first two of the series. Some of the other reviewers had not read the first two books, and I think it helps to understand the characters and why things are happening the way they do.I found the events of ""Derby Day"" to be exciting with the unexpected turn of events. I too, was surprised by the ending, and wonder if it is ""paving the way"" for a possible fourth book in the series (that was supposed to be a trilogy)."
3,great summer read,"This was a great trilogy. Fern Michaels did a great job intertwining the Thortons and the Colemans from her previous two trilogies. There were some characters in the book that were not brought to their potential,but as an overall quick read for a fun summer book I loved it."
2,Not a Fan of this one!,Kentucky Sunrise follows the families of Kentucky through another run at the Derby. I found the story hard to follow and the characters did not have any depth. There was no empathy for the plight of the family members and tangetial stories that distracted from what I think was the main plot. Defintely would not recommend reading this one unless you're on the beach without anything else in your bag.
1,Author obvisouly has no experience in horse racing!,I started reading this book way back in August and I've been reading it for over a month and still haven't finished it. This book is trash! A horse just doesn't go to the Derby without prior prep races. They usually have a two year old season and then they have prep races in their three year old season and if they are lucky the horse makes it to the Derby. Another major flaw is that jockeys would NEVER ride their first race in the Derby. Jockeys start out riding at the bottom ranks and work their way up to the bigger stakes races as they improve. I still can't figure out why this author would write on a subject they had no experience.
1,First Time Reader Disappointed,"I picked up Kentucky Sunrise at the library hoping to find a new author I would enjoy. I am a Kentucky girl and grew up around horses. I will say that Ms Michaels knows horses but she left me utterly confused about the motivation of her human characters. Maybe I need to read the preceding stories so that I will understand why the characters behave the way they do, but the plot development in this book was very difficult to follow. And the epilogue at the end made absolutely no sense unless it was the setting for the next book in the series. I am not motivated to go and read the first two books in this series and would not recommend Kentucky Sunrise."
1,Also not a fan,"This is the first Fern Michaels book I've read, just picked it up on a whim. Absolutely no depth to the characters! Very hard to follow. Half way through the book and I don't even care how it ends! The dialogue feels like it was written by a 2nd grader. One star may be one too many!"
1,"Horrible, Simply Horrible","I can't speak for the previous books in the series (Kentucky Rich) as perhaps the early story of Nealy was better, but this book drove me nuts! I only kept reading to find out if they would race the Derby, and that was a pathetic short part of the book.Are we supposed to LIKE Nealy or feel a connection to her? God, what a horrible mean and controlling woman--famous jockey or no. I didn't like the rest of the family much either. No humor whatsoever. No romance either. The only characters I felt even some humor/connection/likability for were two of the minor ones, Willow and Jake. Shame.Apparently Fern Michaels has written a number in this series, and all I can say is why?"
4,Didn't like main characters...,"and that's just one of my complaints about this book. Kentucky Sunrise is the third book in the Kentucky trilogy and I read them in order. I kept hoping the characters would turn their lives around or learn from their trials but they just seemed to go from bad to worse. Why did I rate this 4 stars? Basically, Ms. Michaels knows how to tell a story, I loved reading about the racing setting and the training of horse and jockey alike. As with all other books I've read by this author, her dialogue needs work. There may be two people involved in a conversation, but one does all the talking and asking of questions before the other is given time to respond. It just seems stilted. I wouldn't recommend this series unless you really enjoy the racing scene."
4,Great book for beginners.,"My only complaint is that not all exercises identify which muscles are being strengthened. I attend a Golds gym that uses Icarian equipment. Most machines have a front and rear view of the human form with areas of the body highlighted for each muscle being worked for each exercise. It would be nice to have something like this in the book. Other than that, there are 115 pages of exercise technique with pictures. Almost every exercise is covered."
3,Insightful yet drab,it offers insightful points of view but doesn't really close in on it's main theory. basically it should be more a tip book for writing stories in video games. Not much here but when there is it is perfect.
5,Great Camera Bag,"My son bought this camera bag for me for Christmas this past year. It's a great camera bag. Not too big. If you have a lot of camera equipment, I would recommend a larger bag. For what I have, it's perfect! Camera, 18-200 lens, camera hood, External flash, my smaller digital camera, batteries, my identification, money, and car keys."
3,eh.,"its a good bag with a lot of pockets but its REALLY small. like the size of a jug of water, seriously. and forget even fitting a water bottle on or in it. but i have a nikon d5000 with lenses and everything fits perfect."
2,Too small if you have more lenses and accessories,"I purchased this bag for my Nikon D90. Since I just bought the camera, I don't have too many lenses and accessories. Even then, I had some trouble to fit in my kit lenses. So I retured it and went for a new one.Pros -Easy to carry (but good if you just one/two lenses)Cons -Too small, highly priced for a small sized bag."
5,Exactly the right size,This camera is a perfect size for travling with my olympus slr and a couple of different lenses. My charger and extras all fit as well. Great price. Great product
5,SCUM-the title of a generation,"the album that stared the heaviest music genre ever-GRIND!!! this album is an album that started grind.simple as that.pure brilliance.crashing drums at a mile a minute, homicidal chainsaw guitar that WILL tear off the heads of the light hearted, a low end bass that keeps the backround steady, and the vocals that created a new form of singing.,. napalm death came out with an underground heavy metal CD later labeled by all as the begining of a driving, powerful, brutal force known to many as grind."
4,THE ALBUM THAT STARTED IT ALL.,"This is a very good album with lots of classic grind hits from this legendary band.The songs are unbelievably brutal and fast.The only beef I have with this album is that the vocals are not that good and the production is not the best.However,I feel this gives the album a certain feel to it.I guess you have to look at it like the reek of putrefaction album by carcass.I would recommend this cd to any napalm death fan if you could get past the sloppy production.NAPALM RULES!!!"
5,change your life,"napalm death didn't create grindcore (hint: repulsion's horrified), but they did help define it with this vibrant deconstruction of crust punk. slurring caveman vocals betray the fiercely thoughtful lyrics; these partially incomprehensible, sludgy bursts of pure neck-breakage attack superficial materialism, careerism, and our everlasting fetish for the glowing screen. moreover, napalm death ask questions well beyond the political particularities of their time. you suffer... but why?"
2,"Please momy, make them stop!!","Even though this sounds like a retarded wolverine having oral sex with an epeleptic cocaine addict, don't judge napalm based on this monstrosity, they got a lot better afterwards, listen to harmony corruption or utopia banished or death by manipulation, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better!"
1,Noisy and Sloppy!!!!,"I am a huge Napalm Death fan but this album is awful.The sound quality and production is the worst that I've ever heard.Plus the vocals are terrible and the playing is sloppy.Pick up Harmony Corruption,Enemy of the Music Business,or Order of the Leech instead of this album.Those three are all very ""violent"" Grindcore Metal."
2,Very dissapointing....,"When i ordered ""Scum"" i expected well plyed grinding riffs and very brutal drumming like cannibal corpse or exhumed.....but apparently the inventors of grind aren't nearly as good as the immitators. The main problem w/ this album is the horrible drumming drowning out everything else. There are other major flaws: Very repetive, boring riffs,terrible production, and the drumming is completely out of sync. Quite overrated( and most death metal is underrated.....get the picture?)I gave this a 2 for inventing a good style of metal, but musically this deserves a 1 as far as im conserned."
1,"Death Metal, Who can like this??","Who can listen this ""music""???Listen: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Guns' n Roses, ACDC or Metallica"
2,Rock is not too strong for me,"I'm sory. I know I should not bring ""physical type"" into this (although, Chris Rock would be the first to slam the way someone else looks). But, I can't look at him without thinking about mice. He just has that ""rodent look."" Anyway, when he tells jokes he nervously looks into the camera, as if to say ""ain't I funny?"" I watched this video because people told me he was so funny and creative and the comedy was so powerful. Well, he's no Richard Pryor. He just doesn't have the edge that Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence has. Some people from Saturday Night Live are just not eligible to graduate from comedy school."
3,How many volumes and how much will we pay?,"People keep writing that these ""Best of..."" DVDs are incomplete and duplicate the same stuff on different DVDs. This Vol. 2 kind of demonstrates that this is true, in my opinion. We're being played (no pun intended), and if we want to have these skits to watch forever, we'll keep buying with high hopes we're not getting robbed. Shame on Lorne Michaels, et al. You surely have enough money by now that you can reward faithful SNL viewers with complete discs of new material on each separately-priced disc. Come on."
2,Not nearly as funny as volume 1,"This is my 2nd review in seven years. I bought this because of the almost 5 star rating. I loved volume 1 and thought this would be even better. The only things really funny were the racist toys, Mike Tyson for president (10 seconds long?), what not to do when getting pulled over by a cop and the taxi cab confessions. The confessions are a 30 minute video extra; otherwise this DVD would have nothing on it. It's a long hour when you hardly laugh. And what happened to Wanda Sykes?? She was hilarious in the 1st volume. If I had to do this again I'd buy only volume 1."
1,Mislead and Seriously Disappointed,"The cover is misleading, Jesse Eisenberg, is barely in this film. My assumption based on the rest of the movie is that they blew nearly all their budget on getting Jesse Eisenberg to do a 5 minute shot at the beginning of the film, and a 5 second flashback (same footage), followed by a 15 second shot.The rest of the film was pretty much a train wreck. I kept watching the movie waiting for the ""horror"". I could have just watched the trailer again, because that's nearly all of the horror in the film. Well if you don't count watching the film itself a ""horror""."
2,good actors; script goes in too many directions,"They put Jesse Eisenberg's face on the dvd cover to sell it, but he is barely in it. The other actors are great even in the smaller roles, but the problem is that the writer/director is writing several different films, and none of them gets fair treatment. Is this a coming-of-age story, a slasher film set in the camp or woods, or is it an anti-religious or pro-religious treatment? It is really hard to say, since none of these threads gets picked up and carried anywhere. Will the young man remain with his family even though he loses belief? What happened to the priest by the end? Will the young gal ever be seen again? Why bother showing the bullies in the forest since they don't have much to do with the story? What was with the demon visions?Too many things to ponder with no real answers."
1,Hell No.,"Offensive, preachy, judgemental Christian propaganda disguised as a horror film.Despite the cover, this is not a Jesse Eisenberg movie. Nor does it contain any horror. I was mis-lead, lied to and manipulated. Ironically, something the Devil is very good at doing.I should've used the $3.99 to buy a ""Spawn"" comic book."
1,should be 0 stars - doesn't give the option,Absolute WORST horror movie that I've ever seen - do not waste this amount of your life on this movie even if it's free - I can't believe I watched the whole thing waiting for 1 MINUTE of horror - this movie is worse than the lowest budget $4000 movie ever made. Ignore the star names - they are in the movie for less than 3 minutes and DON'T EVEN HAVE NAMES!
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"More like 'Camp let's rip people off for a few bucks'I found no viewing pleasure in this film what so ever,the premise and storyline were boring and had nothing to do with horror and Jesse Eisenberg was barley in it.I kept watching thinking ,ok any minute now it has to get better,it never happened.I was also thinking wow,a new slasher flick with Jesse,maybe he owed the producer a favor or something of that nature and it's going to be good.no way,avoid at all cost ,pun intended."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"What the hell did I just watch? The only scary thing about this film is that there are really religious freaks out there, who are willing to send their kids to camps like this. The producers of this movie must have known how awful it was, because they put a big picture of ""The Social Network Guy,"" Jesse Eisenberg on the cover, and list him as the star, when he's in the movie for all of 2 minutes. The star is Will Denton, who you may remember from the short lived TV series, Kidnapped. He was pretty good, so was Gossip Girls, Connor Paolo. It's too bad they didn't have an actual script to work with. It really just blows my mind that things like this get made. No one in their right mind would consider this movie worth their time."
4,Andre Previn plays Harold Arlen,"This is a 1994 digital remastering of an LP Andre Previn made in 1960. As a result, LPs couldn't run to more than an hour's playing time so we have an all-too-brief concert of Previn playing ten mostly well-known tunes by Harold Arlen. I knew all of the tunes except one called `Cocoanut Sweet'. A lot of favourites that have become standards are here: `That old black magic', played up-tempo and somewhat demonically; `Come rain or come shine' - a beautiful tender rendition; `Stormy weather', `Over the rainbow' . . . An entertaining 45 minutes of Previn in jazz mode though I found the Telarc Jazz releases of the Trio more satisfying - longer and, with guitar and bass, obviously a more varied sound. The CD Uptown in particular features Arlen compositions with some Ellington.After Hours With Andre PrevinOld FriendsUptown / Songs of Harold Arlen & Duke Ellington"
3,did not get book,"Was eager to read Don Blanding poetry. Ordered two books. One arrived by UPS. The other only the package arrived slit open and no book. Called UPS and talked to young girl, but nothing ever came of ""filing"" claim...too bad."
4,Quilter,"Being a Floridian, I enjoy previewing books written by authors who represent Florida. I enjoyed this book and will keep it as a treasure."
3,Good for potential GSP owner,"Although I rate this book somewhat low, I think it could be valuable to a person who is considering a GSP. It provided a fairly good overview of the breed, but lacked any real detail on any particular subject. As a GSP owner, I thought it would be an interesting read, and might provide some insight into the behaviour and training of the dog. None of it was new information, and it seemed a little 'light' in what information was there. For training and understanding your GSP, I would recommend other books. If you're interested in a basic overview of the breed, then check out this book."
5,A great starter's guide,"This book is intended for those considering the breed, and it is a wonderful and funny introduction. It is also a fine book for those who have owned GSPs before to enjoy and reflect on their experience with the breed. A must for a person considering getting the breed for the first time. It is in depth about the breed history, standard, and breed character. Not a training guide, but that is not its apparent purpose. Read this one BEFORE you get a GSP."
2,Another Failed Remake,"Wow. Although I do think there have been a few good remakes of Asian films, this certainly is not one of them. I admit, I do love the Pang Brothers and have their versions of The Eye, The Eye 2 and even The Eye 10 (an inside joke, but well worth seeing). This version of The Eye is just not very good. It falls into the category of the ones that should not have been remade for they now are so bad, many will not see the original great work of art. This, I believe was my first Jessica Alba movie, and will most likely be the last. Most of the acting in this was sub-par and then some. The only good actor of the bunch was the cancer patient (also played well in the original). Anyway, I hope this helps some people decide, and I highly recommend the original, as it is SO MUCH BETTER. IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT MOVIE. NOT LIKE THIS JUNK."
5,Movie Review,"I received the movie very quickly, within 3 days and that was using standard mail. I was very pleased."
3,Not Terribly Bad,"I would describe this movie as a mystery/thriller. It is about a blind woman played by Jessica Alba who gets an eye transplant operation. Along with her new eye sight, she gains a 2nd sight. She can see dead people and, I guess you would call them, grim reapers. She also has a therapist that does not believe her during most of the movie, but eventually comes through for her and helps her.This movie almost borders on boredom for me, but it kept my attention with the mystery of why she was seeing the dead. I wasn't use to seeing Jessica Alba in a film like this, but I thought she did a great job at carrying the film and her acting was convincing, at least for me.Maybe, the overall film could have been better, but I have nothing to base that off of. Nothing to offer as to what could be added or done different, but the film tells a story and concludes with answers to questions about the plot of the movie. So, it wasn't terribly bad, but I wouldn't watch it again.Thanks."
1,Neither scary or interesting,"When one would see the previews you would think that ""The Eye"" is a scary film. However, this is not the case! ""The Eye"" is not scary at all, which is probably because the plot is not interesting enough to even care what is going on.""The Eye"" is about Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) who has been blind since an early life tragedy. She has a great passion for music, which fuels her desire to be able to see music, not just hear it. Sydney decides to get a double corneal transplant, which restores her sight. While she is recovering from the operation, she starts seeing things that are not there. After this becomes a reoccurring factor, she believes that her donor could see into a different world.""The Eye"" never really held my interest at any point in the film. The film is either scary or interesting at any level."
3,The Eye,This movie could have been done better. I don't like that she loses her sight at the end. Poor girl.
2,Absolut Booligans,"What an absolutely horrid film. There are a few startling points, but hardly a horror movie. It wreaks of 6th sense gone b-list."
4,Great Flick!,You will not be disappointed in this movie. This is much better than most like it that have been released lately. PQ and AQ are great for this Blu Ray release. I love the Digital Copy feature.
3,The Eye,The movie was ok but not as good as the original. It didn't have the happy ending & was much more haunting at the end. If you like this one then you should love the original.
2,Pretty Boring!!!,"Although it has the sexy beautiful Jessica Alba, it's boring, and dull. Alba plays Sydney Wells, a classical violinist who has been blind as a bat since she was 5. She has a cornea transplant, and now she can see again. She begins to see visions of fire and people dying. I didn't really like the ending. I probably wouldn't recommend THE EYE!!!"
3,Eye see Dead People,"This show reminds me of the Sixth Sense in many ways. A blind musician re-gains her sight through an extra-ordinary operation, where a new set of eyes are transplanted. However, these eyes have a history and apparently, wants to show her something.As the eyes show her new unseen things, she is tormented at first, but eventually she goes to the root, and starts to comprehend what her new destiny is to be.Once this is accomplished the story comes to a full circle."
2,Watching with one eye shut,"In ""The Eye,"" a remake of a Chinese movie from 2002, Jessica Alba plays a blind woman who gets her sight back thanks to a successful cornea transplant. The only hitch is that with her new eyes - which were donated by a young lady with psychic powers - comes the unasked-for ability to see into the spirit world and predict the future.""The Eye"" might have been an interesting film had it focused solely on how a once-blind girl learns to adjust to life in a suddenly sighted world. Instead, we're subjected to an inane, gimmicky thriller in which the heroine improbably manages to run across either a dead person or someone doomed to die just about every time she turns a corner.There's no end of point-of-view shots in which ghouls jump out and yell ""Boo!"" at the audience, but the whole thing is about as scary as a youngster dressed in a bedsheet doing the same thing on Halloween."
3,It's mediocre movie!!!,I have to no commend this movie. but this movie was mediocre movie. Good thing I rented this movie and watched it. I didn't enjoy it at all.
3,"""I'm Going To Help You See The World As It Really Is"" ~ Exploring the Possibility of Visions, Ghosts And Cellular Memory","The '08 film `The Eye' starring the enchanting Jessica Alba is a better than expected remake of an Asian horror film of the same name. Yes, it does start out rat a rather slow pace and any horror fan will immediately notice the liberal borrowing from other horror/supernatural films that precede I such as; `Ghost' and `The Sixth Sense' it eventually discovers a personality of its own and rewards the patient viewer with an overall satisfying experience when all is said and done. Jessica Alba not only looks amazing but delivers a strong performance as the blind violinist and corona recipient that unexpectedly receives the ability to foresee death and disaster along her newfound sight.Definitely not destined to be a classic but I enjoyed it; -3 Stars-."
2,"Modest shoes, hard as rock.","I've got these shoes and they look good, but after some minutes of constant using you will feel the hardness of the sole and they will become uncomfortable.Recommended only for using occasionally and for some minutes. Otherwise you will end with feet pain."
5,Dr. Evans does it again,"Dr. Tony Evans has a gift of breaking down the Word of God in the most simple terms. Even more, he has the ability to take difficult scriptures and relate them to common experiences that make them applicable to our daily Christian walk.Though I have not always agreed with his perspective, I've found all of his books to be a wonderful companion to the Bible.His books have proven a invaluable resource in my spiritual growth. In sharing his books with other believers, they too have be enlightened and challenged to demonstrate their beliefs in their daily walk.I strongly recommend this book to those who are seeking greater faith and a better understanding of God and who we are in His Son, Jesus. In the end, it will be difficult to look at the world without a Kingdom perspective."
1,The kingdom agenda book,The wrong book was sent to me. I wanted the new vension of the kingdom agenda. But it came on time. Thanks.-Augusta Iduoze
4,Amazon Service Is Good,"I ordered four of these mugs to go with my antique white china, as it was cheaper to buy them from Amazon with free shipping, than to buy a set of 4 from another merchant and have to pay shipping. The mugs just arrived, so the review is more about Amazon's service than the product. When the mugs arrived, they were for the wrong Mikasa pattern. I went online to the website, clicked on my order, clicked on the item to be returned, and entered the reason for the return. I then printed out the return authorization and prepaid mailing label, and the package was ready to be dropped off at the post office. The replacement items were shipped the next day, before I had even taken the returns to the post office, and arrived 4 days later. I gave Amazon 4 out of 5 stars because of the original error, but they really did make the replacement process pretty painless. Good customer service."
5,Great set of dishes!,"I purchased this set of Mikasa Antique White dishes from Amazon. They are beautiful! I use them as everyday dishes, replacing them for a set of Correlle dishes I was using. I couldn't be happier. They hold up well. They do not chip and can get banged around. They are much more elegant than the Correlle. The price couldn't be beat, as I purchased them from Amazon's 4 for 3 promotion. Because of this promotion, I was able to purchase the whole set. I am so glad that I did!! These mugs are perfect! They hold a lot, yet they are not too heavy and are so comfortable to hold. I love them!!"
2,Creepy,I can't stand the music-it reminds me of something you would hear in a bad horror flick. My daughter has had this since she was a few months old (she is now a year old) but has never shown much interest in it.
5,Love the new handle!,"I almost bought a Good Grips meat fork with a rubber handle until I saw this one. I love Good Grips kitchen tools, and have come to depend on the brand when I'm looking for a nice, solid, reasonably priced kitchen tool. However, in the past, my one complaint has been that when I store utensils in a crock next to the stove, those non-slip handles that I love stick together, and it becomes impossible to grab just one tool - you wind up pulling out 6. This handle fixes that problem. It still has the nice, comfortable handle with rubber on either side for grip, but the stainless steel is much easier to grab quickly out of the crock. I'll definately be looking for more tools with this handle. The fork itself is nice and sturdy, a good size, and handles well. I would reccommend this product."
5,Great!,The steel fork works perfectly well for maneuvering around a big chunk of meat. Our roast cutting became much more elegant.
5,COSTUME DRAMA AT ITS BEST,"This is a magnificently produced series, with wonderfully cast actors, music and direction. Formula soap, with spectacular location footage on the high seas and picturesque English coastlines. Tall ships and romance abounding. Run out and purchase these, sit back, and be transported.But when, o' when, will BFS release more of the 91 total episodes?!!"
4,left hanging,"I enjoyed the first four videos, but purchased this set believing that there was a conclusion. The character development was excellent, as was the storyline. However, to spend 4 hours watching a series, and to be completely enveloped in the series, and then to have it end when all the characters are at their climax...This seems very unfair to viewers, especially when the viewer can not find the rest of the videos, to complete the story."
5,please can we have some more?,"I was so delighted to find Onedin Line on video, bought it, told all my friends about it, now we want more and it is not there! The music, acting, costumes, plots, are all wonderful. I left UK halfway through the series and now I am in the same boat,(sorry) please help."
5,love it,love . love it. it's a very nice product. arrived in good condition. description is accurate. very good book. will recommend to my friends.
1,bright eyes ripped off david dondero,"i couldn't help but notice all the dismay displayed in the reviews below about 'an angle' ripping off conor oberst (bright eyes). i'd just like to point out that conor originally ripped off a lesser known, less poster boy type, called DAVID DONDERO. he is an extraordinary & original talent who conor was (and probably still is) a big fan of. without conor's indie boy looks & style, david holds less potential for mass marketing, which is why he hasn't had conor's success. you should check him out, and remember he was doing his thing way before conor bounced on to the scene & was given credit for his originality & genius."
5,An Angle is a great band.,"I recently saw An Angle, and it was close to amazing. They didn't really play too much off this album, and when I asked them later I was told that most of what they had played was on their new ep. They did, however, play my favorite songs from this album. Green Water, A Way With Words, True Love, and Change the World. I have listened to this album almost non-stop since buying it and I don't really see that ending any time soon. It's really funny to me, seeing all the negative things people have posted online about An Angle. It really makes me wonder how many of these people have actually listened to this band. I understand the similarities to Bright Eyes, but come on, it is very obvious that they are different bands. I think people should stop paying so much attention to message boards and form their own opinions on what they like and dislike. This band is great, and I can't wait to see them again."
4,harsh comparison.,"obviously, an angle sounds exactly like bright eyes in many respects. but, the truth of the matter is that this album is much more like a streamlined discover america. maybe i should just say that... this album is good. i don't listen to bright eyes much, because i don't connect with the music as a whole. but somehow, i really like this album. i have no clue about it except that i really dig it. listen if you like bright eyes, discover america, or the more mellow twothirtyeight stuff. end."
1,horrible record!,"So alright, some hack like me telling you this album sucks isn't gonna prove it right? Well go just about anywhere on the net, (punknews.org for example), find user comments about An Angle and you will see too that everyone agrees this band sucks pretty bad. I was unfortunate enough to see their live show and I must say it is worse than the record. Everyone that plays in the band seems to be acting way cooler than they really are. Bright Eyes rip off? Hell Yes! But even with that aside, this is really just pretentious crap, I mean... hell! Look at the record cover, you can tell they think they're way too cool! Don't waste your money kiddos! This cd is good for target practice, if you want to buy some funny music, go get a Wesley Willis or even a damn Weird Al CD or something!Ryan"
1,are you kidding me?,"it is beyond me that a record label would put this out. it's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure, subject the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors."
5,the only one with the true story,"I think this book is great and it's because it was written by a close friend of them, and it's the true story.You read what they felt and how they started. Maybe the other books have better pictures, but no one of them have ever said only true stuff about them and their beginning .Just half true, and the rest , what they have heard. (Mariana G.N.)"
2,Not the best book,This book was not very informative. They talked about the same stuff they talk about in interviews. The author did a very poor job in writing. The pictures weren't the greatest. I felt this was a waste of my money.
2,"not a very good ""BOOK""",I dont' think they should have put out a biography with so little to tell. YEAH< there FAMOUS WHOOWHOO so is everyone in this world. But they called it the OFFICIAL BOOK and they were only famous INTErNATIONALLY for like 6 months or something. NOT COOL>
3,I was very dissappointed in this book.,"I have always considered myself a true Hanson fan. Not only do I have six different books about them, but at one time I had 1015 pictures of them on all four walls of my bedroom (it may seem hard to believe, but there actually are that many pictures of those three out there). This book was a big dissappointment for one main reason. Yes, it is the ""official"" Hanson book, but it says the same exact things that all the unofficial books say. Sure, there are plenty of cute pictures of them when they were extremely little that no other books seem to have, but the information was the same. This book deserves the three stars I gave it because Isaac, Taylor, and Zac are three adorable guys with a lot of talent. I love their music."
3,It wasn't as great as I thought it would be,"The book kinda lacked interesting stuff, I mean it was well...what we all have heard about the band for months! The picture were Ok but, they weren't many of them in there. 64 pages was tiny for a book that cost $10.95. I love the guys but the book was a bit of a waste."
3,written for younger people,"As a huge fan of Hanson (14), I found that the book was written with small words. Not to mention the huge size of the words. It seemed like the book was meant for only ""easy readers"" (no offence to people who found the book perfect, but it's true).The pictures were the highlight of the book, new ones and older ones. Still all the info in it can be found on the internet and has been said in TV interviews."
3,Very uncool info on Hanson,"This book is just a review of their early life, pretty boring, it's just like a normal life. I BTW like Hanson and their music alot, but this book really puts me off."
5,Hanson: The Official Book,"This book was absolutly amazing. It had all the inside facts about Hanson's journey to the top. What I loved most was the younger pictures of them. I recommend it to every Hanson lover . . .P.S.~ I have over 6,550 pictures of Hanson!!!"
5,HANSON: THE OFFICIAL BOOK IS #1!!!!!,"Hanson:The Official Book is absolutely fantastic!! It's nice to know you're reading true facts and not something that the authors have ""heard"". There are great pics and it talks about the music; not what color of underware they have. If you love Hanson and their music, I definately recommend this book."
5,This Book KIX!!! i love hanson but this book tells it all!!,I love this book! it was great! i read it 5 times and every tim i find something new and better about the trio : HANSON! they r wonderful sweet people and are better than any other band in the land!!
4,Very Good,"This is a good book because it has the whole(true) story. But, it's missing just general statistics, like if their right-handed or left-handed--each book I've read says something different! That ones been bugging me forever! Anyway this book also has very cute pictures of when they were little. A great book for any fan."
5,hanson insperational,ive read this book 2 times it is not only the best book that i have ever read but it also i think very insperational.just the way there parents sung to them i mean thats like so cool that they would write about there little sibs not many singers would do that and the funny part was when they were supposed to be doing the dishes they would instead write a song.i like the way all their songs actually have something to do with an actual subject i mean not like ...my nose is on fire or something like that and thats why i like this book you should deffniatly go buy it once you read this book you will never want to put it down.
4,Unflinchingly hardboiled.,"Dashiell Hammett, the legendary writer who singlehandedly made hardboiled crime respectable subject matter for American novelists, pulled no punches when he authored The Glass Key. The pages of this dark, decidedly non-uplifting book are teeming with violent acts and political corruption while vividly showcasing the basest of human instincts. The characters are largely unlikable. And that includes the novel's protagonist, Ned Beaumont. Perhaps especially Ned Beaumont. Ned is a professional gambler and the righthand man to a powerful political boss in the unnamed city in which most of the narrative of The Glass Key unfolds.The unsolved murder of a Senator's son provides the backdrop against which the numerous examples of depravity and hard edged action take place. Hammett unflinchingly tells this brutal tale using crisp, uncomplicated language that flows smoothly. The Glass Key is an ugly story, beautifully written. Highly recommended."
4,"a rather tame effort by Hammett, which is a good thing..","'The Glass Key' is one of Dashiell Hammett's more controlled, accessible mysteries. The number of characters involved is limited, and the characterizations are uniformly excellent. The story, about political corruption and murder, is something like Hammett's earlier 'Red Harvest'. But 'Red Harvest' was a bit excessive in scope and as a result its plot became somewhat undecipherable after a while. Fortunately 'The Glass Key' doesn't degrade in that way ... in fact it gets better as the story progresses (complete with a good surprise ending).Bottom line: a measured, competent effort by Dashiell Hammett. Not among his more famous works but certainly among the better."
3,"Plastic, what can I say.","Plastic, what can I say. After regular use the plug will begin to try to come apart. I have had to use JB weld on mine to keep it together."
4,Covers polarised and cross-polars nicely,"I believe this book is ideal for a second year University student to learn to identify rocks and common forming minerals under the microscope.Regardless of earlier critics, this book is only intended as a help to identify common minerals and nothing else. I personally found it very useful, the colour images are worth more than a thousand printed words."
5,great addition to my set,"I love this Mikasa set, and the covered butter dish is the right size to allow either size of butter stick to fit."
5,Perfect Spatula!!,I bought this to replace the exact same spatula that I already had. I accidentally got mine nasty one day and couldn't use it for food anymore. It is the most awesome spatula I have ever used and I LOVE being able to use it in my cast iron and not have to worry about it melting!!
2,smells terrible,"I didn't buy it on Amazon, I bought it in Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't know whether it is the store's problem or what, the spatula has this horrible cheap perfume smell. I didn't realize this until I used it to stir the corn soup(since it's heat resistant and my pot is non-stick), and the soup tasted like perfume. Afterwards, I tried to wash it with detergent, soaked it in hot soapy water, nothing would make the smell go away. So buyers be aware, check the smell of the spatula before you use it."
2,Big Disappointment!!!,"I thought this one might be kind of cool, with a beautiful female Zorro instead of the usual male. The casting was alright, but such horrible writing! Of course, with Surrender Cinema producing it I knew they'd be taking an erotic angle, which would have been fine if only they'd succeeded at it. But no, this one is bland and uninteresting. The worst part was their attempt at a girl-girl scene. It started just fine, but then it's almost like they lost interest and it fizzled away to nothing. Just like the video itself. A waste of time and money!"
5,Sacred - Worth every penny and then some.,"It may have been buggy at release, but the 1.5 update, which I applied before I started playing, seems to have fixed everything for my machine. I've been playing almost non-stop for 2 and a half days and not a single glitch that I can find.Diablo II fans should rejoice at this truly excellent game. Better graphics, a map that is bigger than you can possibly imagine, simple controls, a little bit of innovation (combo moves, Saraphim and Vampiress characters, special abilities, etc.) good story, diverse adversaries, good music, and a whole lot of fun. I discovered this game by accident on-line, and had a hard time finding a copy near me, but the effort (of driving to a GameStop in downtown Boston) was worth it in the extreme.Go buy this game immediately if you have any love at all for Diablo II style gaming."
3,sacred review,"this is a fun game with a lot of cool features (like the option for horses). The gameplay is a little rough at times, and the storyline is barely there, but it makes for a good rpg style hack 'n slash. Multiplayer is definitely rough, with no party options and no clue where anyone else is. Overall good game, and a good start to the Sacred series (no, I haven't played the new one yet)."
1,I just have to say my piece,"Tried this game on my two machines: Duron-1200, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE -and- a laptop P4-2667, 512MB, ATI9000-64MB, Win98SE.I managed to play at most about 5 minutes then it took down both my PCs. Game didn't work on both campaign and multiplayer modes.After many attempts, reboots, even reinstalls, I gave up, and already uninstalled the game.Although, I'm thinking of trying it on my third PC: P3-550, 256MB, GF3-64MB, Win98SE... nah..."
2,Tedious and boring.,"I tried this game over a course of several months and really tried hard to enjoy and like it. But unfortunately it is just too boring. Nothing of significance ever happens. You just go from one place to another slashing and hacking but get nowhere. Unfortunately this problem is not unique in PC games. Some games such as the old King's Quest and Ultima series as well as the newer Baldur' Gate manage to keep the story interesting but this one does not! For example, you can do a whole dungeon and all you get it is some very standard treasure. On the occasion you may get a stand alone side quest. To keep the game interesting a story must unfold. Conversations with locals is very limited and you don't get much by going around and talking to people. On the good side, the interface is great. In fact the game engine by itself is very good and able to create a great game. It is the story which is poorly done."
2,Good try but wait til they get more bugs out,"If you liked Diablo or Dungeon Siege, you ought to like this game BUT... On my Windows 2000 system even with the latest patch and updated drivers (and on all other versions of Windows according to other reviewers) it bombs out the system after 5-20 minutes of play -- first slowing down to a crawl and often ending with a Blue Screen of Death.There are a few uncompleteable side quests, repetitive go-fetch main quests, and a final act and endgame that are over in three minutes with no challenge. Generally good playability -- mostly hack and slash so the different character type abilities make little difference. And that leads to limited replayability interest.Riding horses is potentially a good idea but fighting on horseback is limited and you can't outrun swarming enemies even when riding.But it's better than nothing while waiting (perhaps forever) for a new Diablo follow on."
2,If I could only play the game.......,"So, I recently aquired this game through this very site expecting it to be a fantastic game. It is as far as I can tell. However the game is so buggy right now that it has ruined everything about the game.I feel like I paid money to test a BETA version..which makes me fairly unhappy. I hate bugs and the bugs in this game are driving me nuts. Even after the update to 1.6 bugs are still aplenty. One bug that is really bothering me is the inability to alt-tab out, or when someone messages me. The game just dies."
3,Diablo+bugs,"This game has so many flaws its pathetic. Complete a quest, and it wont know it. Buy a horse and it vanishes. Take a portal, and all quests are erased. Crashes frequently as well. But, it is a copy of Diablo 2. And it ends the same as Diablo 2(without the expansion)if you know what I mean. Another reason not to buy it. Wait for the expansion and buy the complete game so you can beat it. by then maybe Encore will have enough patches for all the bugs. Oh, and you cant multiplayer via LAN unless you have a HUB or router. More money I didnt have to spend when playing diablo. Help BLIZZARD save me from these idiots."
1,"Barely works, and support is lacking","I got this game a few months ago and I have only been able to keep it running for a few hours of gameplay. And the company's technical support doesn't know anything at all about their product. I let them know what is wrong, give them crash logs, everything...and they still can't figure it out. It got to the point where I gave the game to my friend and I just play it at his house all the time now. Don't get unless you know EXACTLY that it is going to work."
2,Beware... Good game... poorly made,"This game has a lot of potential, but shouldn't have been released yet. Be especially cautious if your computer is near the ""minimum specifications"". My computer is at the low end, and I can't even play half the time. I freeze (requiring CTRL-ALT-DEL) 3 or 4 times before I can actually log on. When I finally get logged on, the game will kick me off the server with no warning at random (every 3rd or 4th game). There are countless bugs, mis-spellings, and problems. I foresee an endless series of patches for online play. If you can stand the hassle... go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,There are less bugs in a Louisianna Swamp!,"I have NEVER had so many problems with a game as I have with this one. Mind you, not every game that comes out is perfect, but at least they could have made the darn thing able to START without having to hack the file and UNCLICK all of the ""supposedly"" great features!!I'm glad that I bought it used for a cheap price!"
1,Caution Laptop Users,"First, I gave this game a single star for one reason. I couldn't play it. It might be a great game and bought it based on recommendations made here. However, when I got it home and loaded it on my laptop (866 PIII-M, 1 GB mem, 16 Mb Video), it actually hung my XP system - impressive! I set all display and sound options to the minumum, downloaded the patchs, got the latest DirectX runtime (9.0b) and still it would not load. If you look in the readme file the company mentions that the game may not run on all laptop tops due to their inability to test every integrated video chip configuration and I guess mine was one :(. So, if you're thinking of installing this game on a laptop please be aware that there may be problems. I'm not saying it won't run (I had the minimum recommended system requirements but not the recommended requirements) but be prepared to be frustrated and ensure you can return the game if it you have too."
1,WHERE'S MY REFUND,This gun is plasticky it's flimsy. It does have a that realistic fell like a real gun would have. The hammer and all other details that would be on a real gun doesn't work only the release mag and safe. Im very disappointed and returning it. DON'T BUY THIS GUN !
1,weak,This gun is weak at its best.. Didnt come with instructions and it could barly put a hole in a piece of paper... good gun for a 5 or 6 year old...
1,Not worth it,"I bought this book with high hopes that it would help me study for the CRC. I am afraid to use it because it is so outdated. My book is copyrighted 2003, but it has not been updated. There are terms that haven't been politically correct for years. Technology and the way Rehab counselors use technology has changed drastically and a study guide really needs to address this. The book is question/answer format, but there is no feedback about why an answer is correct. There are plenty of other study guides out there, not to mention a free one on the Internet, that would be much more helpful than this."
2,not for kids,"My child loves the 20Q product made by this company but this one has disappointed us. My 9 year old gave up on this quickly because the simplest level 1 speed was too fast and frustrated her quickly. It's definitely aimed at adults. I was looking for activities for my children; i.e. hangman, math facts, recall. I took a risk on this item based on its very vague description here at amazon. I couldn't find detailed info about it anywhere on the web, nor did I find the product in any stores. It's not what I was hoping it would be. This is our second electronic toy disappointment this Christmas morning. Now I wonder what the return policy is for products which must be forcibly extracted with a utility knife from their plastic package before you can actually find out what they are!"
3,Brain Game needs more brain in design!,"I purchased this to help keep my memory sharp. While the overall game is challenging enough there are 2 features Radica needs to change. There is this annoying little professor guy that is in one of the games and pops up at the end of each round to tell you how you did. Also, they advertised that the screen font is large and it is, but there is a line of numbers on the key board that are used for one of the games and these are way too small and the key board itself is awkward. I would probably rate this 5 stars except for these 2 features."
4,Great Gift,"Love the product, just the right amount of both the perfume and lotion. Enjoy the fragrance and sometimes hard to find this particular item."
5,Love it,"I smelled this fragrance in a magazine in junior high, and have been looking for it for years. Finally found it and I love it. It's appropriate for work and a night out."
5,A good explanation of how magic works,"This is a definite must have book in my opinion. I see it as a successor to William G Gray's ""Magical ritual Methods"" Stewart does an excellent job of discussing practical magical work, particularly in describing how magic works and what the practitioner can do to refine his/her approach to magical work. I liked the methodologies presented in the book as well as the author's perspectives on different topics within magical work. This book will provide a solid grounding in how magic works and will help you improve your practice."
5,black suede enzo angiolini boots,"Great boots ! Comfortable, stylish, great price !! I wear them everywhere."
4,The Best in Mecha,"This is much better than the other gundam series. Overall all of the gundam shows are the best mecha-type anime there is out there and has the best characters and the best action. I don't even like mecha that much, but out of all anime, gundam has become one of my favorites due to the great character detail and superb animation."
3,Meh,"I had to read this for my Costume Design class this past Spring semester. We only used it for one play, the ""Private Lives."" So although I cannot review the other two plays, ""Private Lives"" was the most frustrating, agonizing, and drawn out play that I have ever read as a Theater Major."
4,A classic,"I had this book as a child and recently shared it with my own children. My 5-year-old has been asking for it every night since I first read it to them, and my 3-year-old likes it too. I can remember reading it to myself, so it also has appeal well into grade school.I remember loving the rich colors in the book and as an adult I appreciate the Giotto-esque style of the illustrations. The writing style is literate yet straightforward enough that my boys were able to summarize the basic narrative after the first reading. My sons both seem to be excited by the party theme and my 5-year-old talks a lot about how Harlequin's friends and mother help him.Probably not worth $60+, but otherwise well worth picking up if you stumble across it."
4,Hit That Funky Salsa Beat!,"This is a wonderful album that is equal parts smooth and funky. You can relax or dance to it and is as good as anything. Superb, classy musicianship, especially the bass playing - very nice indeed! For tasteful funky salsa I would heartily recommend this album."
4,"Well, Okay, But Gee","I'm glad I purchased this via Amazon - because directly thru Pantone is expensive. However, this metallic swatch book sure was expensive for the 300 or so swatches. The only thing about this book that annoys me is that it's longer than my other Pantone swatch guide books so it doesn't fit in the Pantone holder with the other guides. I can't zip it up! Warning to those using metallics - the darker the metallic, the less metallic the ink looks."
1,no way to cross reference with CYMK guide colors,I need to match metallic colors with 4-color CYMK print colors for consistency with branding and there is no way to do this with the information provided. Each Pantone metallic color references 3 other Pantone formulations and relative percent contribution of each.Instead of a step forward it was a big step back in terms of being able to communicate a metallic paint and have it color match that on a 4-color press printed piece of collateral or packaging.
4,3/8 Flex Conduit,"This is a great product if you have a small wiring job and need to protect the wire. It is a 25 foot roll of 3/8 flex conduit. It comes neatly packaged, doesn't take up a lot of space, and is reasonably priced."
1,A boring book,"A boring book filled with narratives, possibly copied from an encyclopedia, about historical figures. Apparently, stories from their own lives could only fill a few chapters of this book."
1,From this day forward,From the editorial review the books sounds like blah to me. Nothing unique. So they had a good marriage. Great for them. Not worth the effort.
2,Fairytales can come true?,"Can a Catholic American princess from a prominent political family find happiness with a Jewish aspiring journalist from Bayonne, N.J.? Appearently so, if 1) she really wants the marriage, 2) he consents to a Catholic wedding, 3) he's willing to use her connections professionally and socially, and 4) he is an early model Sensitive New Age Guy, who can live with being perceived as a beta male. The most interesting messages this book sends may not be the ones the authors intended."
3,Very talky,"This was my first (and thus far, only) Bellow novel, and I can't say I'm racing to pick up another. I had very high expectations, which were not met. Although passages of this book are quite beautiful and sensitive (most of which concern his wife and her dying mother) I was overwhelmed by how Bellow uses the main character as a megaphone through which to pontificate on contemporary race relations. He dramatizes nothing and leaves nothing for the reader to do. The setting, side by side, of a racially-inspired murder in Chicago and the death of an old woman in a communist country is certainly interesting, but way too subtle for me, especially in light of how heavy-handed Bellow is in other parts of the narrative. Still, I read this novel over two years ago and am still thinking of it; parts of it come back to me like a sepia-toned postcard, very fleeting."
2,The Worst Bellow Book?,The dialogue and endless introspection offered in this book gets tiresome quickly. Bellow's best work came before his Nobel Prize and this is an example of his weakening powers -- when his ideas outweighed action to create tedious novels.
4,interesting book,Fascinating insight of a dark time in the Eastern European history- communist dictatorship seen first hand by an american
2,Not Saul Bellow's Best Book,"If you have not read anything by Saul Bellow, don't start with this book. It is pedantic and involves characters about whom it is difficult to care very much."
3,Gangster games on the seamy side of the Florida Keys,"There aren't many characters to root for in this story, especially the anti-social, anti-authority hero Thorn. Too typically, the characters for whom Thorn has a soft spot are murdered and his latest girlfriend is the sister of a childhood chum (she also nurses a grudge). However, to lift this novel from a lower rating, there is a clever underground railroad service that the bad guys offer to undesirables who want to disappear from their enemies. The title deserves some credit too for the double entendre applied to both a winter cold spell and the utilization of an ice cream truck"
3,"For Completists only, but...","This isn't a particularily great album- Blank Generation is definately the place to start if you want to get into Richard Hell. But if you listen to Blank Generation, you'll either hate it or fall in love with it, and if you love Blank Generation, your going to buy this album anyway. There is no middle ground when it comes to Richard Hell.Richard Hell was (from what I have gathered) in the depths of his heroin addiction while recording this album, and just didn't really care about it. Except for a few highlights, like ""I can only give you everything"" or ""Destiny Street"" it is a weak album for only true fans to enjoy. But Richard Hell on a bad day whips most crappy ""punk"" brats until they cry.All hail Rock 'n' Roll."
4,King of The Mountain,"This book got me hooked on David Thompson, I would have rated it with a 5 except it like all his books in this series are too short. They are like chapters not a real book. You just git into it and the book ends. I have bought 6 of his books or chapters and will not buy any more and there are about 64 in this series. I really like his writing but he needs to write a book not a series of chapters. The world is changing he, the author needs to keep up, every one is going to Ebooks, these are not available for ebooks."
3,Quick mailing,Book was in fairly used shape. Enjoyed the book just found this series would like to find more of the series
2,elastic doesn't last,"I ordered these hoping that they would be higher quality knee socks than I had used before. Within a couple of hours, these socks were slouching around my ankles. Not worth the higher price."
2,Not what I would expect from Triplett,I have used Triplet meters for over 40 years. I was purchasing this meter to replace a cheep one from Sears. I was disappointed as soon as I turned it on. The functions are not easy to use as well as the construction seems to be another China knockoff.
2,Ok But,I've been using this meter off and on for a while now but I don't have anything to compare it to. If I had used other meters it would help me rate this meter but I do have some problems with its operation.1) The light only stays on for a few seconds when I would like it to stay on for at least minutes until I stop using the meter and then go off with the meter or till I specifically shut it off.2) The display has little tiny symbols on the display that are difficult to read to know what mode the thing is in.3) Very hard to get the thing to stabilize and sample a voltage where I feel confident with the reading. Just not well implemented.I guess for the money you get what you paid for. Don't think I would buy again but rather look for a meter with good reviews?
5,Even my wife who was raised as a meat & potato girl loves them,I have introduced these to many people that were not vegetarians and have yet to find anyone that does not like them! I wish Amazon would start carrying them again.
2,Not what I thought they were ...,"These are okay. My son ""tolerated"" them, so I will give them 2 stars. Otherwise, they are mushy dogs -- and not tasty. I love the Worthington Superlinks and I thought these would be comparable."
4,Its a fun movie,"But then as a man, I really enjoy seeing the three actresses {Jaci Velasquez, Roselyn Sanchez, and Sofía Vergara}. If you detach logic for a while and just want some light comedy with some latina beauties. Reminds me of Charlies Angels but with less crap and a dash of spice."
4,good grip,"as the name, it has a good grip and its size is proper to usei recommed you! you may satisfied!"
5,EXCELLENT,OXO is the best in everything they make. Cannot go wrong. It is great for my arthritic fingers. Makes all tasks painless.
3,Not bad!,"I probably should have measured to see what 9"" looked like before measuring. I thought it would be a bit bigger of a whisk.On a side note, however, it does a great job with sauces or smaller jobs. The handle does seem a big wobbly at times, but it hasn't come apart yet."
4,Oxo Whisk,"All oxo products are a dream to use, so the whisk was a very welcome addition to my kitchen stash. The handle is so comfortable, that it makes each and every whisking job a breeze. The only reason I give it four stars rather than five, is the fact that I have difficulty cleaning the small ripples on the handle."
5,Terrific whisk for small jobs,"When I ordered this whisk I was slightly unsure about its usefulness, but I did know my smallest existing whisk was too large to get into the corners of small sauce pans (with straight sides) and too clumsy for whisking a couple of eggs in a small bowl.Oxo has nailed it again. This whisk reaches into the corners of small pans, is just right for mixing a few eggs or incorporating ingredients into a pan sauce. The handle is comfortable. I'm a hero at home for making this purchase. Thanks Oxo."
5,Oxo makes the best stuff!,"Love this whisk, the grippy handle is perfect! I needed a whisk that wasn't too big and to use for when I make hot chocolate. This whisk fit the bill!"
3,too many bad comedians,"this is a five disc set that could easily be condensed into three very funny discs. each disc at some point leaves you wandering 'is the next guy going to be funny, man i sure hope so'. this set gives you a chance to see some of todays best comedians when they were much younger. some peoples bits are very short, one joke short, which leaves you feeling a little jipped. The replay value is minimal because you have to skip around so much to keep the laughs going."
3,No rewatchability,"These performances all come from '80s basic cable, so there's no really blue material here. There are some funny sets on this disk (Brad Garrett, Drew Carey and Ellen DeGeneres are standouts, as you might expect), along with a few clunkers (a young Adam Sandler's terrible and Unknown Comic Murray Langston's bit is shockingly terrible once he takes the bag off). Bob Zany is nowhere to be found even though he's supposed to be on disc 4, bay-bee. Bruce Baum is introduced as Bruce ""Bannin"". Kelsey Grammer is no stand-up comic, and it shows. Jerry Seinfeld's bit is literally a minute long. The extras are beyond worthless. I checked this out from the library and recommend you do the same, or rent: your enjoyment of the good stuff will be tempered by your overall buyer's remorse."
2,"Fine for household, I'd skip it in the garage","I tried to use this on a tight, round (5"") metal part (a variator on a scooter) and a mechanic friend and I both found it to be useless. The strap is very narrow. The handle is very thin/plastic. There is not really a locking mechanism for the strap.It might work great on jars or even plumbing, I wouldn't know."
1,Not helpful,"I have had this thing for 2 years and have only gotten it to work once. Most of the time it is just to difficult to use, and it slips way to much. Spend the extra bucks to buy something that works well."
4,i thoroughly enjoyed it,"I love Air. I always have... and I always will. The reason this video doesn't ""work"" for some people is that it was not really made with American sensibilities in mind. In fact I think it kind of mocks Americans. It's like a French film, you may get bored, but that's because it's pretty straightforward, and there's no surprises. American's like action, etc., so that's exactly what we don't get (until the videos)... Guys, appreciate the video for Air, and it's commentary on us Americans."
2,I should have listened to the bad reviews,Me being a die hard AIR fanatic I decided to purchase this documentary despite the bad ratings. I didn't learn anything about AIR on neither a musical nor personal level. This is probably the worst documentary I have ever seen. Terribly disappointing.
3,Almost Boring,"I am a great fan of Air, but it's one thing to listen to their wonderful mellow grooves and another to plant yourself in front of a television or whatnot and watch a mostly black and white video about their 1998 tour. It is great, if you do not expect to be entertained continuously for an hour. I found most amusing was the interviews with people on the street in New York, London, and Paris with questions such as ""Do you know Air?"" ""What is Music to you?"" blah blah blah french accents blah blah blah. Buy it for the collection of Air videos at the end: Sexy Boy, Kelly Watch the Stars, All I Need, and Le Soleil Est Pres De Moi."
2,"Boring, Snoring, Ignoring, and at times Annoying","I purchased this DVD with high expectations of seeing the band perfoming Moon Safari live. While there is some footage of the live performance, its no where near what you'd expect. The title is correct, this is more of a documentary than about the band playing music. A little of the documentary style would have been fine, but when the entire DVD is full of people talking about how great the band is and, well, it just gets old. Like others, I would have much preferred to see the band performing live and less of the filler. I wanted to see how they were going to create the vocals, and what types of instruments they used.The music videos on the DVD are the only reason I keep it. I prefer the remix of Kelly Watch the Stars on the DVD, its a bit different from the version on Moon Safari."
4,Very Pleased,I received this order in a very timely manner and it was properly wrapped and protected for shipping.
1,Warning: Contains Garlic,"Description didn't include ingredients, and I wish it had. Garlic is toxic to dogs, it is bad for their kidneys. Now I have to return this stuff and keep buying the same old treats that cost 2x as much."
4,dog treats,recommend this product to all dog lovers. have been using this product for 5 years. hard time finding for a good price.
5,Classic.,"The legendary ""Moose Turd Pie"" is included so that alone makes it worth it. Most songs on this album are about trains, hobos and lost love, not political issues, but that doesn't mean they're not full of Utah's characteristic poignant wit."
5,Easy Spirit shoes,The shoes arrived soon after ordered. They fit as I expected and are of excellent quality.
3,Too narrow in the toe area,"I was disappointed after reading all the great reviews on these shoes. I could tell they would be really comfortable when I put them on and stood up, everywhere except the toe box. They are bullet shaped, like many other brands. I think most brands are made for a man's foot- I need a narrow heel and wider, deeper toe box. I really wanted these to work for me but I can't stand shoes that rub against my outer toe area and pinch my toes. I don't have wide feet- in fact they are sort of narrow. But they are definitely not bullet shaped. If I got these in wide they would be too wide throughout the rest of the shoe- so I had to return them."
2,Serious Decline in Quality,"I was a loyal Easy Spirit customer for about 10 years for both walking and dress shoes. My first pair of Romy's that I purchased a few years ago held up well for a year. The pair I purchased on February 27, 2012 already look and feel as if I have been wearing them for a year. This pair and the previous pair that I purchased last fall were both were made in China. I am looking at a pair of New Balance that are made in the USA for my next walking shoe purchase."
2,Going back,Ordered them from the good reviews but I really should know better than to buy shoes on line. They seem to run short and they just seemed cheap......thus the price but I have had Easy Spirits before and loved them. I will be sending this back.
4,Nice,Love it very comfy? My wife runs in it daily she loves it and she had bought another pair since.
5,Excellent Shoes!,"As always, these shoes fit as expected and are very comfortable. Great shoe for the price. Cannot beat the price."
2,runs small,"While I love the look of this shoe, is runs small. I will be returning them. I needed them in a hurry and was able to find a pair local. I purchased the same pair just had to go up 1/2 size. The shoe its self is a great shoe very comfortable."
5,Easy spirit Romy sneakers,If you have a narrow foot there are just certain companies where you can buy narrow sizes...I am very pleased I have been able to purchase these on line and they are long lasting with a good arch support.
2,Very Disappointed,"These shoes were a real disappointment. They appear to be made well enough but the materials are certainly subpar. The shoelaces are thin and hardly long enough to double tie, the ""leather"" is nearly as thin as glove leather and the soles are just hard foam. These were also supposed to be medium width which always fit, but when laced to fit, (as well as possible) the leather at the bottom of the tongue was puckered. I ordered two pair of these shoes and now have to pay for shipping to return them."
3,Not constructed well,"Although these sneakers fit well, they are coming apart in the front. This should not happen because my daughter has not had them that long and does not wear them every day -- maybe once or twice a week."
5,easy spirit romy sneakers,they are the most comfortable sneakers for me. i would recomend them to anyone who wears sneakers most of the day.
3,Eh...,"Didn't wear well- fabric isn't as good as prior pair. Hopefully things will go back as they were, I loved the first pair, and they lasted 2 years with 6 days per week walking!"
3,good looking shoe,"The shoe is good looking but I didn't realize it was a level one shoe. I wanted a more durable shoe as I wear the heels down all too quickly. This shoe doesn't have as much wear resistant material at the outer heel as I prefer. Otherwise, the shoe will work for more casual walking such as shopping, sightseeing, etc but not major walking. It's a wide but I could use a bit more width. . . . it's not quite suitable for what I wanted but I can make it work in other ways."
4,A good shoe,Like this shoe. It's my third pair. Recommend it for comfort and support. HFC Why are you requiring me to say 6 more words?
3,They do not hold up.,"I have had these about 6 months and only wear them occasionally. They look like I wore them every day.The material will not hold up, another China product."
5,Great sneakers.,This is my 5th time purchasing these sneakers. They are the most comfortable sneakers and I am going to hate when they stop making them.
5,Wonderful!,"I originally saw these on zappos and figured since they were Easy Spirit they would be more comfortable than my current nikes , which I regret buying. I bought a size 9 there but the shoe was a little big so I sent it back and was hoping to buy an 8.5, but for a supposedly huge selection of shoes they have a limited amount of sizes. I started shopping around for the shoe and found Amazon had them. And they were $15 cheaper and in my size! They arrived 2 days ahead of scheduled which was very nice. I tried them on and my feet practically sighed in relief and comfort. I am so glad I bought these! Now I am enjoying my new shoes and considering buying another pair before they dissapear."
5,LOVE THEM!,"The only sneaker that I've tried that doesnt have to be broken in to enjoy! I fell in love with these sneakers the first time I tried them on and discovered how comfortable they are. I worn them till I couldnt wear them anymore, yes they can get ragged when worn everyday! lolI went back to the website to order another pair and they were on back order only to be pushed back again so I tried Amazon and not only were they cheaper as in $20.00 cheaper but they were in stock! They arrived quick but this time I'm not wearing them everyday like I did before, yes I want them to last a bit longer than my first pair, lol!I highly recommend these to everyone, so please do not hesitate to order, you wont regret this purchase!"
5,Instant comfort,"Have been wearing sneakers for 60+ years and this is the first pair that was comfortable right out of the box! Wore out one pair/ 2-3 years of wearing and so pleased to find them still available. Roomy toe area, no heel rub. Have arthritis in low back and this sneaker makes long( 4+ mile) walks much less painful. I toss them in washer/cold water and hang to dry........look like new every time."
2,Jump in tone and theme between first and second halves,"I read this on the recommendation of a German friend (who, of course, read the original, not the translation). I'm not quite sure what to make of it--I feel like, in production, the switch in tone from rather larkily written ""does love overwhelm even madmen?"" farce to serious commentary on the responsibility of scientists in a commercial, WMD-manufacturing world (and the ego it takes to believe you can control knowledge and its use) could feel more like a nuanced punchline, a clever bait-and-switch, than it does on paper. On paper, it feels disorienting. Reading it over a second or third time might help me uncover more thematic links and foreshadowing to tie the two halves together, but a first readthrough left me feeling that I had read a piece that had ambitions it didn't manage to achieve."
4,old friend,"""the physicists"" is a delightful short play that our amateur theater group staged years and years ago, in which i played the part of einstein.in the play, a manaical doctor virtually imprisons famous scientists in the hope of getting her hands on the ""unified theory"" which would explain all scientific and natural phenomena and would therefore make her rich beyond anyone's dreams.but needless to say, her plans go awry ... (i shall not divulge any more of the storyline!)what made me look for this play at this time? i remembered from my lines that einstein was born in ulm, and my wife and i were taking a river cruise down the danube ... we didn't go to ulm, though; the nearest we got to it was vilshofen.i was glad to find the book!"
3,Small gravy boat,"Maybe this would work for syrup or sauce, but honestly, it's way too small for a gravy boat. It only holds 8 or 9 ounces of liquid. You would either be refilling it 2 to 4 times before everyone is served, or you would need several on the table. What could Mikasa be thinking? On the upside, unlike a lot of gravy boats, it pours nicely, and has a nice saucer to catch any drips.In hindsight, I should have shopped around and gotten something larger and not wasted my money on this one."
5,Impressive guide...,"This is an impressing critical overview of the broad specter of theories and methods under the umbrella of cultural studies. The book gives you some sense of direcion as you enter into the sea of confusion made up by the various schools of thought that have influenced todays cultural studies, be it withing media, popular music, folklore or popular studies in general. The book includes a glossary of key concepts, and can be read like a companion to cultural studies. I found a lot of valuable information as the author traced the historic roots of various subjects, enabeling me to change perspective with him as he went along. I am myself a music student, studying within the field of popular music..."
4,An Excellent Work!!!,"The book shows the author's breadth in grasping and interacting with various theoretical schools of thought and their founders. Each theory is assessed succintly and critically. The book provides a window to look into the world of those who have changed the way we live, our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. A summary is provided at the end of each chapter. Overall, ""Cultural Studies: Theory and Practice"" is a good place to start to learning the subject matter."
1,Great?,"While there are some genuinely great Jewish women in this book, there are too many whose claim to greatness rests solely on fame and left-leaning politics. How is Barbara Streisand a ""Great Jewish Woman""? Is it because she is a great Democtratic fundraiser? And How does Shulamit Aloni get to be great? By being an anti-Israeli Israeli? Diane Arbus (eeww) hated being Jewish and would be uncomfortable to see her name in this book if she hadn't killed herself, and Estee Lauder became a Roman Catholic........not exactly a ""Great Jewish Woman"".If your idea of greatness is actresses and singers or anybody Jewish who managed to get her name in the paper than this is your book. Rosalind Franklyn and Judy Resnick constitute real greatness, while Goldie Hawn is merely famous. I would never put them in the same category."
2,Flimsy piece of junk,"My daughter received this for a birthday gift and was thrilled when she saw the box. However, after taking the pieces out and putting them together, and putting them together, and then putting them together AGAIN, she lost all interest in it. She loves the 2 cats from the movie and was most excited they were included. The wedding arch falls apart if you look at it wrong.I would not spend my money on this unless you intend to sit there with your child and reconstruct the thing every time she moves."
2,too flimsy,this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart. the archways do not stay on them. too expensive for what you really get. i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats. I would not buy it.
1,not for playing,"this toy is only good for decoration. it collapses very easily and its parts, some of them small and necessary, are quickly misplaced."
1,Piece of Junk!!!!,"My daughter got this for Christmas and she was so excited for us to open it. It is the most flimsy and cheap toy. It will not stay together or stand up. The only durable parts of the toy are the wedding cake and the cats. Please, do not waste your money on this toy."
1,CRAP,"I think I've thrown piece by piece of that flimsy ""toy"" away. My girls played with it once, then they couldn't get it to stay together so they never played with it again. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Balance at Middlefork : An attempt to write,Please don't ever compare this book to Persig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values. This book doesn't inquire anything but how to babble. Go re-read Zen and the Art and save your money. This guy likes to hear himself blab.
5,a balanced view,"Dorosin takes on a tough challenge -- to pick up where Persig left off with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance -- and he does a fine job. It's a tough topic and Dorosin uses the story of his conversations with a friend as a way of making otherwise compliated issues understandable. The story itself, without the philosophy is good. But the combination makes for a terrific read."
5,A great storyteller and a great book.,"I have loved the Outer Banks of North Carolina for some time now.Charles Harry Whedbee gives a well written account of some of the mysteries and legends surrounding the area in this, and all, his books.Basically, this book is just a collection of stories he has recovered from local people.I wish he still lived so he could share more of his love of North Carolina with fans."
3,"Great Product, but Can't Use It","I love the product, and have been using similar ones for about a year. Last night though, I was thrown out of a game for using it. The ump said I ""altered"" the bat handle. So be aware. I guess I won't be using them anymore. Oh, I am in an ASA league."
2,I must be the biggest wimp in the universe,"Spent at least an hour trying various methods to get the Grip-N-Rip over an adult softball bat knob. Yes, before even starting I'd seen the instructions on their web site. Failed. Again and again. Tried boiling some water and heating up the Grip to loosen it up. Failed. Again and again. Finally just cut it with a scissors, put it on the end (doesn't fit tight, of course) and put some tape over it. It's an inexpensive product so I didn't expect much, and I'm using it on an extra 28 oz. bat my team has (an old aluminum -- we just bought a composite) so it's no big loss. Nonetheless, be prepared for some difficulty getting the Grip on the bat and if you lack patience or are quite evidently the wimpiest guy on Amazon, you'll end up writing a review like mine."
5,Crazy good!,"When they say uncensored they mean it. For every thing you think Gordon Ramsey says, there's much more that the chefs have to say."
4,Impossible to put down,"although Liss's ""The Coffee Trader"" was a terrific read, it is refreshing to catch up on the events of Ben Weaver, master thieftaker and pugilist. Liss consisitently delivers an exciting tale, weaving his deft research skills with suspenseful storytellin to create a superior adventure in this novel. He proves to be unprecedented in this art of presenting innovative historical fiction. My only complaint is that the first novel seems to be the tightest of them all, as this one feels the slightest bit rough in the beginning getting started. However, once it begins you cannot put it down, and it is a terrific read. I highly recommend."
3,Not as good as his Conspiracy of Paper,"Don't get me wrong -- this is a very good book -- better than 95 percent of what's published as popular fiction. But it's not up to the standards set by ""A Conspiracy of Paper"", the first book in this series. Spectacle is an exciting book, but there are various loose-ends that are never tied up, and the some of the characters' behaviors seem contrived.Well worth a read, but if you had to choose one Liss book for your stay on a desert island, I recommend Conspiracy, not Spectable."
1,A boring slog that doesn't live up to its potential,"I read David Liss' ""A conspiracy of Paper"" and ""The Coffee Trader"" and enjoyed both, so when I purchased ""A Spectacle of Corruption"" I was looking forward to another jaunt through England in the 1720's (the 1722 general election in particular). I studied European history in college and love historical fiction set in the eighteenth century. However the plot never really grabbed me, the characters behaved like cartoons rather than real people, and I gave up just over half-way. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
4,"Better than the first Benjamin Weaver book...not as good as ""The Devil's Company""","I liked it but wanted to like a whole lot more. I read the books out of order and perhaps if I hadn't done that, I'd have a better appreciation for character development, etc. I still recommend this and ""The Devil's Company"" and perhaps if I have time to re-read the three books in sequence, I'd give all three five stars. Don't let this keep you from reading the book...just try to read them in order."
3,rita,"David Liss does a great job. Just one thing that is rather bothersome: he talks about ""communist notion"" in 18th Century England? That philosophy was not born yet! Please..."
3,Not as good as Conspiracy of paper,A readable book but doesn't live up to the twists and turns of the first.
1,Dribble,I highly recommend this book if:(1)You enjoy plots and subplots directly out of commercial novel writing 101.(2)You like being able to foretell the rest of a book after reading only the first few chapters.(3)You are fond of novels that plod along like drizzle on a cold London day - dribble - dribble - dribble.(4)You are a reader who likes developing a knowledge of history from friction rather than from a good verifiable written account.Today I am very happy to celebrate two things:(1)Osama bin Laden is dead(2)I did not buy this book; a friend loaned it to me.
4,A good read,"Before reading this book I recommend you read Liss' first book ""A Conspiracy of Paper."" The first book will introduce you to Benjamin Weaver and London in the early 1700's. In both his books Liss displays an uncanny abilty to weave history with fiction. One can feel through the authors first person detailed descriptions the grit, grime and smell of that time and place. Both books smoothly moves one through intricate plot and unforgetable characters. Both books are page turners. A highly recommended read."
2,Good idea poorly excuted!!,"I hate when the author/publisher is so cheap that they recycle material and don't have decency to edit it.In this book you will find sentences that don't make sense, cryptic questions referring to deleted material, and obvious mistakes in figures and illustrations. I bet that the size of this book will double if it was reviewed by a decent technical writer.I have to lecture out of this book as an assignment. So, I'm doing a very rigorous reading/summarizing to create my presentations. At the moment I'm doing chapter 15 and so far it has been a mixed ride. Sometimes, I have to read the paragraph to make sure I'm getting the point. Most of the time it works but sometimes I'm left puzzled. Sometimes I felt like that some topics needed more depth and some had mundane details and repetitions.Bottom line: this book needs to be edited properly. As it stands, it is not worth its price. I would say it is worth...uhmmm... 10-15 max."
3,High-level view,"Very much the 30,000 foot view of systems engineering. I picked this book up because I saw it referred to all over the place, and assumed that it was reasonably definitive. Sadly, it is not. What the book does do is give the reader a reasonably good high-level overview of systems engineering in general, and of some of the techniques involved in estimating the ""ilities"" of a given system design. However, the level of detail on any one subject area is very light, and the bias of the book is very much toward DoD-style systems engineering. A good book for systems engineering managers. System designers should also seek out Wymore's ""Model-Based Systems Engineering"" for a thorough understanding of requirements and design."
4,excellent book,great book introducing the field of systems engineering with lots of critical topics to the design and analysis of systems
3,"OXO MUST HAVE DESIGNED A ""SILENT WHISTLE""!!!??","WHISTLE STOPPED WORKING, WHICH IS A REAL ANNOYANCE, AND DANGER. IT IS MADE WELL, NICE LOOKING, BUT SOME ONE WORKING AT OXO BETTER RETHINK THE WHISTLE PROBLEM!!!!"
1,Don't buy this and save your money (and maybe your house)!,Faulty whistle makes this otherwise decent kettle very DANGEROUS!
2,uplift teakettle,"I was dissapointed in the color. Its listed as mock yellow, but it is mustard or a goldish color. Also the whistle sound is obnoxius. I would not reccomend this for just anyone because the tip and open spout could be awkward and dangerous in the wrong hands."
3,"Product is great, but the screwed up the color.","I asked for a red OXO Kettle, got a silver. I never sent it back but disappointed that I did not get the color I wanted.The kettle works great otherwise."
2,Good-looking but rusts and leaks,"My wife and I had registered for this at Macy's as a wedding gift. While it looks great and is easy to use, we're going to have to replace it after just a few months because the joint around the body and the bottom has completely rusted and now slowly leaks water.I'm about to check to see if there's any guarantee, but otherwise I can't recommend this teakettle."
3,Great Kettle .. Misrepsented Color !!,"Although this Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle is a wonderful product .. the ""Green"" I ordered and received .. was NOTHING like that which is shown on the Amazon web site. I was attracted to this particular shade of ""Bright Apple Green"" which would blend in quite nicely with my kitchen decor. However .. the one I received was a rather DRAB DARK OLIVE GREEN .. and needless to say .. I'm extremely disappointed."
2,Nice looking Kettle but has some faults,I like this kettle but wished I knew more about it...the first time I used it I had a problem...after the water was boiled and it was whistling...I went to pour and the bottom of the spout made a crackling noise and a big chip of the black paint came off....now that I read all the other reviews I see this as a big problem....I am afraid to let the kettle get too hot or else it will happen again in another place...I do not recomend this product...
2,Poor quality,"I have had this tea kettle for a little less than a year. Because it is made of two separate pieces of metal (one for the bottom, another for the sides), it has started to leak out of the seams. Definitely not worth the money."
1,Paint came off 1st use!,"We received the red uplift as a wedding gift several months ago. We finally got around to taking it out of the box and boiling some water. The whistle worked fine, but when we poured it there were flakes of blue paint in the water. We opened up the top and the blue enamel on the center of the kettle had completely flaked off and it actually looked like rust. Again, this was the FIRST time we used the kettle. We are returning this and getting another brand."
2,Plastic spout cover melted,"This kettle works great but after two years of use the plastic spout cover has bubbled and melted from the heat. Who knows what icky plastic vapors I have inhaled in my kitchen...and I really have to wonder why they put plastic in an area subject to so much heat! The kettle has also become stained and messy looking, but that's probably my fault for not scrubbing and polishing it every day.Because of the otherwise great functional design, I would buy another one of these *IF AND ONLY IF* it had an all-stainless spout cover."
4,Well designed; not all that long lasting,"I have many pots and pans that are decades old and work well despite frequent use. It's true that I use a tea kettle at least once every day, probably more than any other piece of cookware. So it's not surprising that after 20 years of using my old Revere Ware copper bottom kettle, it bit the dust. I decided to upgrade to a fancier brand, the Oxo, about four years ago. It held up well until this month when the bottom started to severely corrode. Is four years a good lifespan for a kettle? I don't think so. It's on the low end of my expectations. On the plus side, the kettle is well designed and has nice balance. But next time, I'm going back to something a little cheaper with a copper bottom."
1,Disappointing Tea Kettle,"The positive reviews about this tea kettle seduced me into buying it. The kettle came quickly as all Amazon products do. Service from them is excellent, but I'm reviewing the kettle, not Amazon. The kettle's spout and mechanism that opens it will break apart as they are flimsy. Suggestion: Don't buy it if you are looking for a sturdy tea pot. This aint it!"
4,Attractive and functional kettle,"I've owned this product for about 4 months and find it to be a well built and sleek kettle that fits will into a stainless steel kitchen. The whistle is nice and loud, and the lid opening mechanism tilts at a good angle to make it easy to pour and to fill. The only concern would be the longevity of the mechanical component, so we'll have to see if it holds up."
5,Love this teapot,"We love this teapot. For years we had a prior oxo version of the teapot which finally wore out, this new one improves on the old one. The old one had plastic that was stylish, but ultimately carbonized after years of use. That's gone now. The best part is the handle, push down the spout opens, lift up and it closes. No burned hands. Has a large solid base and heats quickly."
5,Replacement whistle works perfectly!,"I fell in love with the color and style of the Pretend Green tea kettle several months ago but hesitated purchasing it because of some of the negative comments about malfunctionative (<<< made up word) whistles.I contacted Gretchen at Oxo...who told me that yes, many of the original whistles were defective but that Oxo has fixed the problem. She said that the new ones shipped out have a new-and-improved whistle that is loud and they would replace any that ceased to notify tea drinkers.In fact, she even sent me one before I purchased the kettle, which is a good thing because I got an older style whistle that didn't work well. The new whistle (easily installed) works perfectly and is fun (as many noticed, it sounds like a train).And the rest of the kettle is really cool, too (especially the style and color options)."
1,This teakettle contains cadmium (toxic heavy metal),We just had a number of things in our home tested for lead another other heavy metals and this teakettle tested positive for very high levels of cadmium (a known carcinogen). Yuck. Not cool.Our teakettle is orange and it's possible that there is less (or no) cadmium in the unglazed or other (not red or orange) colors. But who knows.You might want to stay away from this one --or ask OXO for confirmation that other colors are free of heavy metals: [...]
5,Great little kettle...,"I love my OXO Good Grips Uplift Teakettle. It's so easy to use and I get so many compliments about the look and feel. I also had to call OXO Customer Service about a problem with my whistle and those people are fabulous. Couteous, polite, and helped me with my problem immediately...Wonderful company!!"
2,Not worthy of the Good Grips moniker,"I generally love ""Good Grips"" kitchen utensiles, but am very disappointed with this pot. The design is not up to snuff. It's difficult to fill, usually doesn't close tight enough to whistle, and the handle gets very hot. And the lid broke after a few months of light use.These flaws are what I'd expect if I bought a cheap kettle at a discount store, but for $50 I expect better. I've always been a fan of Oxo, but if this is any indication, they've lost their emphasis on quality and usability (and their justification for a higher price)."
1,"Look elsewhere, there has to be better out there!","I purchased this piece of junk for $50 and the whistler died within a year. I must admit it does feel comfortable and the Uplift design is a great idea, but it is not worth buying so you can eventually burn your house down because the tea kettle whistle did not go off. Find another way to spend $50, because this is not it!"
2,"Clever idea, but materials lacking","I really liked the ergonomics of this product. OXO does such a great job with that stuff. I happily used this kettle for a couple of years. Problems arose when...1. The screw holding the handle to the body of the kettle corroded to practically nothing, and the handle fell off. Stainless steel or brass would have worked better than the steel screw they used;2. The rounded bottom allowed flames from the gas burner on which the kettle was warming to rise up the side of the kettle and melt the spout flap!I don't know what temperature was reached, but to use materials on a kettle that can melt at household-use temperatures is a big oversight in my book."
4,Customer Service to the Rescue!,"I received this kettle as a gift. Like others, I love the design but ran into trouble with the whistle (or lack thereof). My kettle whistled sporadically for the first few weeks, then gave up entirely. After a review of the other comments here, I realized my problem with the whistle was not unique. So, I called OXO customer service and related my problem. They could not have been more helpful! Within five days I received a brand new replacement in the mail, with postage paid for the return of the defective kettle. Good customer service to the rescue!"
2,Do NOT buy this kettle!!!,"They changed the Uplift kettle, and the newer generation is definitely inferior to the previous. The kettle no longer features the pleasant harmonic whistle. The stainless kettles also have a seam along the bottom that the colored kettles do not have. It distorts the aesthetics. And the brushed stainless model takes FOREVER to boil."
1,Design flaw led to broken handle lid on two separate models,"My wife and I experienced the same problem that a few other people have mentioned, but I wanted to add that we even returned the kettle for a brand new one and it happened again. Surely this is a design flaw.The lid forms a tight seal, and is actually difficult to remove. The handle on the lid broke off within the first month of usage. And we were even gentle with it the second time around.Poor design and/or craftsmanship on this one. You have been warned."
2,Looks great but badly designed,"I bought this kettle because I liked the modern design. That's about all I like about it. It's difficult to load with water, it's started leaking from the seams after only a few months, the handle gets hot...""good grips"" this is not. I recommend staying far away from this kettle."
3,"Love it, but....","This is by far the best design I have ever seen and I adore my teakettle. There is no spilling from the spout when you poor and you can easily pour one-handed because of the unique tip-and-pour feature that lifts the spout when you pull up the handle.However, I am saddened by the fact that the removable lid (which is a great cleaning feature) cracked within the first month of owning it. I went back to the store and was given a new replacement lid and it cracked also within about four months!This time the crack is small enough that I am still able to use the kettle but it sure would be nice if such a great design held up as well as it looked.Perhaps I got a couple of ""lemons"" but I would have to wonder since I bought first-quality at a reputable store. Hope you have better luck if you give it a try!"
5,Great Tea Kettle,I purchased this kettle about 5 year before. It did rust inside because i did not empty it each night but I purchased it again to replace my old one as it is a great tea kettle. The handle keeps it from getting to hot so you won't burn your hand when you pick it up.
2,Good design but,I was specifically looking for a tea kettle that whistled and whistled loudly. Sorry to say that my search was not meant by this product. Other then that it looks good sitting on your stove and is easy to handle with even when the kettle is full a water.
4,"Looks great, works fine for now","We enjoyed our previous Oxo uplift teakettle (in stainless steel), which was sturdy, well-made, modern-looking, and easy to use, so were happy to find a version in orange (enamel coating) to brighten up our kitchen. Our previous kettle started fail (leak, whistle no longer worked) after several years of heavy use on a gas burner. The lid to the new kettle is a bit flimsier than our previous kettle, but hopefully that should not affect its durability. We love the look of it; we'll see how well it holds up - we'll be satisfied if it lasts as long as our previous kettle given the abuse we're bound to give it. Only complaint: the option of the orange color is more expensive."
2,Great...when it's not falling apart!,"About a year ago, I started drinking more tea than coffee at least during the winter months. SO, I needed a kettle. The first Oxo I bought lasted about 2 weeks before the littole hinge pins at the spout broke so I took it back. Now the handle on the cover has broken a screw mount so it will either have to be replaced or repaired. When it is together and not falling apart it works great. I just done have that much confidence in it's quality."
2,Too many flaws (...),"Sequence of events that led to this review:1. I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid (not the spout) did not fit right, and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand.2. I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout. (This made cleaning it impossible.)3. The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots.I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle, They were kind enough to send one to me. This kettle was great -- at first; but, after awhile, the handle loosened up and, yes, steam began to escape. It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten-dollar kettle that has lasted me for years.Save your money. It's a great concept but short-lived."
3,its boils but no whistle,"I have bought many items from amazon, all very good quality, but this item has a design defect, the whistle is a metal reed, and alot of the time fails to work, it does boil fast and the rest of the product is very good, the manufacture needs to review this design.."
2,Steam problems and no whistle,"From reading the other reviews, I see that my problems with this kettle are not unique. It actually seems like I was fortunate, because mine just started having problems at three years old. It's stopped whistling and the steam escaping from it is a little scary, which it wasn't before. It always boils quickly. The lid can be hard to get off and on, and the moving handle has always made me nervous (but no injuries yet!). It's way overpriced, too. I got it as a wedding gift. Don't buy it yourself."
4,Long Search for Perfect Tea Kettle Ended!,"Wow!! Great design; loved the ""pumpkin"" orange (really a bright spot in the kitchen!). Well made. Easy to use. Unique design of spout eliminates the old fear of scaled fingers! Delivery was super swift (faster than predicted by Amazon). Thanks!"
3,New generation tea kettle not as good as the old but customer service is excellent!,"Our ""old"" Uplift kettle lost its whistle altogether and made no sound at all when water was boiling. I called Oxo and asked if we could just get the replacement metal plate that generates the whistle. (BTW, we love the low, harmonic ""train whistle"" sound which is the reason we bought the kettle in the first place. We don't like those high-pitched piercing whistles.)Oxo's customer service rep, much to my surprise, said they'd just send us a new kettle! I couldn't believe it. Just like that. The new kettle arrived today and is obviously a redesign of the old kettle. It's beautiful and boils water just as well as the old kettle but alas, the harmonic whistle is gone, replaced by the high piercing whistle. It was a real disappointment. (I'm also wondering about their instructions to remove all the water from the kettle between uses. That seems a bit odd since the kettle is designed to hold water.)"
2,Disappointed with this teapot,"This teakettle was given to me as a gift. I will say that it does the job. It boils water. But there were many things I dislike about it. I dislike the uplift mechanism to open the spout. I found it cumbersome. The whistle was odd. It had a low sound and reminded me of the sirens some cities use as am emergency alert signal. I usually kept the spout open so I wouldnt hear the whistle. I have now had it for about a year and today when I pulled open the stopper to add water, the handle snapped completely off.Thats a good excuse to get rid of it. Okay it did the job but there are better teakettles out there. I wouldnt buy another one of this model. I would not recommend this kettle. It does boil water so it worked (until the handle broke)."
3,The whistle is sporadic,"I own many Oxo products, and am for the most part very satisfied with their quality and engineering. I find this teakettle to be generally of good quality, sturdy, and comfortable to use, but the whistle has some sort of flaw where it doesn't whistle about half the time. If I snap the lid open and closed a few times it tends to clear it, but if you need the whistle to be a reliable way to tell when the kettle is ready, you may want to look elsewhere- I saw several other reviews that mentioned this same problem, so it is probably a general design flaw and not a specific problem with just mine."
1,bad design,"This was an expensive kettle, and it isn't even worth half of the price. The lid pops off and the handle keeps getting loose and has to be tightened. I think their marketing plan is flawed. Buy something that will last and won't need to be replaced in less than a year."
1,handle melted off,"a very cheaply made contraption, the handle melted off the first time I used this kettle. I'm mailing it back to OXO.I rated this with one star only because there was no option for no stars."
1,I would give it zero if I it was a choice,"I ordered this kettle in March. After receiving it, I noticed that it imparted a terrible chemical taste to the water. I sent them an e-mail describing the problem and requested a refund and a method to return the item. Their web site directed me to call their help line, which I did. They were very polite and indicated that they would send the shipping label so that we could return the kettle. They indicated that they would issue a full refund. After 2 weeks I had not received the label. I placed another call and was told that my request was being processed.I finally received the label and instructions and sent the kettle back in late April. I received the refund Yesterday, July 17-- after 2 more calls.This product is awful and Oxo's customer service (save for the very polite staff) is terrible. You couldn't pay me to try another Oxo product."
1,Expensive / poor quality,"Initially, I was put off by the cost, but figured it must be a quality kettle. Within a few months of owning the pot, the handle to the water reservoir broke. An end of the plastic handle pulled off the lid. No problem, I just screwed it back in. A month later it pulled out again. This time, I unscrewed to the handle to find that the screws were only held in by a metal collar embedded in the plastic. The metal collar somehow stripped and pulled out of the plastic. The handle was permanently broken. I pressed the handle and lid back on and started filling the kettle through the pour. The screws holding the handle on the lid started to rust.I also found the pour handle clunky. If you don't hold it level, it will pop open unexpectedly and splash water out. Not a big problem for me, but my wife (who is petite) always had a problem holding the pot with one hand.The pot is getting replaced. 50 dollar piece of garbage."
2,Get something else,"We've had this kettle for about three years, and every time we use it are reminded of how much we dislike it. The whistle stopped working a while ago, the handles get uncomfortably hot, and it doesn't clean up well (we have the ""stainless"" steel--not really so stainless). My biggest complaint with it, though, is that the lid--which is wide, and is supposed to make the pot easier to clean--is really difficult to take off and put back on. Every time I pull it off of the tea kettle I end up banging my hand on the handle. Ouch! Buy a different tea kettle. That's what I'm finally doing."
2,Stopped whistling,"Very heavy, whistle sounds like a steam boat. But worst, it stopped whistling at all after a couple of months. Very disappointing, given the high cost and Oxo's usually good products"
3,I thought it was the perfect tea kettle until....,"It stopped whisteling....after only 1 week! It's a great design and the ""stay cool"" handle (although quite warm) enables me to lift it without a dish towel, but I am going to exchange it for another one.I love the deisgn so much I decided to give it another try.PS: That horn sounding whistle is a little annoying, but I guess an ordinary whistle isn't exactly pleasant either."
1,Rusty Stainless,"I am very disappointed in the kettle. Not only does it have an unreliable whistle (which someone already mentioned), it also started to rust inside! I like to keep boiled water in a kettle, because I prefer not to use tap water when I cook. After a few days of keeping my kettle filled, rust appeared. As a comparison, my cheaper enameled kettle lasted for 2 years without rust. Although I do like the innovative design, I am returning this item because it failed to do the tasks a basic kettle should: whistle and store water safely."
1,Attention - floaters! Particles and black film,"I bought the shiny chrome ""stainless steel"" model, washed before using, as they recommend, then boiled water for a pot of tea. Noticed my tea was leaving black grease-like marks around my cup and could see a visible slick or film on the water. Poured the rest of the water into a clear pitcher only to find black floaty bits in it. Don't know if it was from the sealer or if they were actual pieces of metal. Cleaned, boiled another pot of water and the same thing happened. Boiled again at length with white vinegar and water. Still, there were floaters. Needless to say, I returned it immediately. Injesting unidentified floating objects with tea is not recommended.Looks cool, interesting pouring concept, nice colors but water comes out dirtier than water put in. Could just be a problem with the chrome pot. I heart OXO, but will definitely not be buying their tea kettles again."
1,Poor workmanship,"Generally I love Oxo products, but I was really disappointed with this one. Shortly after receiving this as a wedding gift, the whistle stopped working.About 6 months later, the seam at the bottom began to leak. I don't remember reading anything about not leaving water in it, but it seems like you should be able to leave water in a teapot. I have a Revereware teapot that is over 12 yrs old, I leave water in it all the time, and it works fine. The only reason I switched was I liked the wide mouth on the Oxo so I can get inside to clean. I've gone back to the Revereware."
5,sweet,"This kettle is a great size,has a comfortable handle, is easy to clean. It also looks great sitting on the stove.The handle stays cool and opens easily. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
2,Leaks....,"I purchased this for my wife for Chrtistmas and brought it home to find it leaked water from the top the 1st time we used it. If you look at the top handle, its angled toward the rear. If you are not being careful and watching your ""water level,"" when it starts to boil, it leaks from the top handle. It caused a mess for us. Also, I was not fully satisfied with mechanism it uses to open the spout. Unless the tea kettle is placed on a flat surface, you cannot open or close the spout, because it uses leverage (from the handle). We took it back the day after Christmas. Still looking for a perfect tea kettle...I thought $50 would have done it, but I was disappointed."
2,does not whistle!,This pretty teakettle does not whistle! I believe it doesn't whistle because of the uplift handle/spout mechanism. I tried boiling water several times and each time the water boiled it did not whistle. I went to the stove and held the handle down tight - with force - and only then did it whistle.... but upon letting go it stopped whistling. So - if you want it to whistle - you must stand by the stove and apply pressure to the handle so that the spout cover closes securely - and if you have to do that- then what is the point right?
2,The clever handle gets in the way,"Oxo used to be synonymous with good design -- but this tea kettle should have been left on the drawing board. In theory, the clever handle (lift the kettle, and the lid automatically opens) is a good idea, but if you're used to a standard kettle where the handles swings out of the way, this one might seem too awkward. The handle gets in the way of both filling and washing up. Other than that annoyance, the kettle does have one good thing going for it: the wide base is excellent for gas stoves; flames don't reach the sides. Some steam escapes the lid if it's not fitted precisely, but the whistle is sharp. And, it looks nice, so...that's good."
2,A lot of money spent for a teapot that didn't last,Purchased this as a gift for my mother. She loved it. A bit heavy though. After 6 months the whole whistling assembly fell apart. Now looking for a new better tea kettle.
1,So disappointing,"I was so excited when I saw this. Simple, elegant.... But in less than a week, the covering on the spout was melting off. And we are in the kitchen while the tea kettle heats - there is no letting it sing away for minutes at a time. How can you make a product for boiling water if the temperature at boiling causes the spout to melt away?I really feel ripped off."
2,Just okay,"I had this kettle for several years and was very excited when I bought it. I liked how it opened by tilting the handle and the fact that it had a large opening for easy filling and cleaning. After a few weeks, however, I noticed that the screw that held the handle in place was getting loose. Eventually the screw would pop out and the handle would be useless. I was able to tighten the screw with a screw driver, but hated the fact that I had to do that every 3 weeks or so. I didn't want to buy a new kettle because I had spent $50 on this one. I recently bought a new kettle, but did not get another oxo. I usually like their products, but is one I will not purchase again."
2,dog ears,"You would need to be able to hear as well as a dog (or cat) to hear the whistle on this tea kettle.Yes, It is very pretty BUT it takes forever to boil water in, the spout opens every time you touch the handle & the lids leaks (as in when it is boiling, water & bubbles come up from the edges of the lid well before the whistle makes any sound at all (what little sound it makes).Too bad, the idea was good"
3,good kettle for 1-1.5 years,"This kettle seems to be pretty good, but it has two flaws (it is a reason why I have awarded it only 3 stars):1) after 2 years of use, it stopped whistling2) it is not very convenient to fill it with water due to the handle position"
2,Rusts inside!!!,"Oxo Good Grips Uplift Teakettle, Brushed Stainless SteelI bought the green enamel Oxo Good Grips Uplift Tea Kettle 2 Qt. capacity less than 6 months back. I use it daily to boil water for cooking. I take good care of it- keep it clean and dry when not in use. Unfortunately, it has began rusting inside where the spout meets the kettle. This is definitely not worth the money.2 stars for the good looks and the comfy handle."
3,sickly yellow color,"The kettle doesn't hold as much water because the opening is tilted, not flat. And the color is an unattractive faded yellow, it will likely clash with other yellow colors in your kitchen. I own other OXO Good Grips items and like them very much, but I would not have bought this kettle if I had known the color was so sickly."
1,Nice looking junk,"I've had two of these and both had the same problems after less than a year of use -- the cover expanded and became very difficult to get on and off, and the handle loosened until eventually I couldn't get the screws back in tightly enough. So I tried a different brand, the Medelco Rondell, at about half the price, and now I am totally staisfied. In this case, you don't get what you pay for."
1,Design Flaw,"This teakettle has a design flaw. The handle on ours started to come loose within a month or so. It has to be retightened every week or it almost falls off. The loosening occurs at the spot where the handle is attached and by the uplift, which creates a constant yank on this spot. Very frustrating for an expensive, otherwise good tea kettle. Don't but it. The problem is inherent on the design."
1,"good looking unit, but not a good design","On the Oxo model I use, the lid is held together by two screws where the handle attaches. Every three days or so I spend a few minutes removing the several pieces of the lid and carefully re-assembling them, and tightening the screws with a screwdriver, it's not a big deal but it's not awesome either.The angle of the handle makes the kettle difficult to fill, if you fill it through the removable lid the handle is in the way, if you fill it through the pour spout the handle is at an awkward angle relative to the faucet or water pitcher.After several years of daily use the parts all still look new, they are obviously high quality, but the poor engineering has me in the market for a different kettle."
2,expected better,poor design with the handle in the way when your filling it from the top. expected better from Oxo
1,Not Recommended,I like nothing about this kettle. The handle shifts unexpectedly which makes it awkward to move to a different burner and downright dangerous to pour. The instructions say to empty after use. It feels flimsy.
2,Broke after two times,The handle on the lid pulled off after we had only made two kettles of hot water. Must be some flaw in the design of the lid fastener.
2,lousy new whistle,"My 2004 uplift burned out (someone left the whistle top open while heating on the stove) so I bought a new one. My old one had the cool train whistle, which was a selling point for me, but the new model has a weak high pitched tone. I'm taking it back to the store tomorrow for something else. Too bad, I really liked the handle."
4,Excellent product,"Everything about this product is great. It's easy to clean, easy to pour, and the whistle is quite pleasing to the ear. The vast array of color choices also makes it easy to match any kitchen decor."
1,Not for gas stoves!,"This kettle is not designed for a gas stove. All it takes is one use with the flame a bit too high or the kettle a bit off the center of the burner, and the plastic spout cover melts. The whistle is in the spout cover, so that falls apart soon after. I did like the design, but only consider it for use on an electric stove."
1,returned after one use,"I bought the Uplift kettle in the ""polished stainless steel"" finish (it's shiny, like chrome). The included instructions state to clean the kettle before first use ( using hand washing, warm water, liquid soap, no abrasive powders or steel wool). I followed the instructions, and after that ONE washing, the surface is covered in fine scratches and scuffs! I probably would still have kept the kettle, except that the whistle is VERY quiet! It's not even audible from the next room. That was the deal breaker. I bought this kettle for my parents, and if I can barely hear the whistle, they never will, and this kettle was way too expensive to risk letting it burn up."
1,"Poor quality, like everyone says","I actually purchased two of these. The second was purchased when the whistle stopped working on the first (I thought the broken whisle was my fault because it ran for a few minutes). Both lasted about a year. Here's what's not to like:1) Rubber handle splits along bottom seam2) Whistle stops working after a short while3) Hard to refill with water if hot, steam burns your hand4) Lid difficult to open/close5) ""Stainless steel"" mars easily, does not retain appearance6) Takes forever to boil contents7) Bottom seam leaksMany other reviews echo these same experiences. While it appears to be a nice unit from a company that normally has a good reputation, it is not. Be forewarned, don't but this item."
2,no good for the price,this kettles handle gets two hot and ive only had it for awhile and the wistle is going out. not impressed.
1,Cannot hear whistle,We bought this to replace a teakettle that didn't have a whistle. This wasn't any better. Even though we both have normal hearing we could not hear the whistle anywhere outside the kitchen. Replaced with a Kitchenaid kettle which has a far louder whistle.
1,Don't do it.,Oh it boils water and it pours nice but soon after you use it it stops whistling and you may burn the pot when your depending on the whistle. A big safety hazard.
2,How long should a tea kettle last?,"If your answer is 5 years, then this tea kettle will meet your needs. If you expect quality that will last for decades (and come on, there aren't many moving parts here), then look elsewhere. I've had mine for 6 years, and after 5 it stopped whistling. This is really dangerous because it's easy to forget that you've turned the stove on. Another reviewer mentioned the seal going bad. Mine never suffered from misuse, overboiling, etc. Also, the enamel on the outside is starting to degrade. I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement, and it won't be another OXO."
3,Dance by Keith Haring,"A short, brightly illustrated picture book featuring Keith Haring's stylized figures dancing. Each page is filled with bold designs, repeated patterns and implied movement. The florescent blues, oranges and yellows stimulate the eye and show interest. The book also contains Keith Haring quotations intended to provoke thought and understanding of his work. These quotations are difficult for younger students to fully grasp. The pictures, however are ageless and appropriate for use in a classroom."
3,Gamecube's controller RUINS another good game,"The Gamecube version is wacked! The control is lame! You can't use the control stick, ONLY the pad. Non-symmetrical buttons totally kills this game!The gamecube controller dont have enough buttons to execute everything too."
2,Eh. No.,"DEFINITELY not as good as Soul Calibur. Graphics don't compare, gameplay isn't as smooth, controls aren't very easy to use. You have to use the DIGITAL PAD! My moves can't flow because of that.I only played for about 20 mins, wasn't impressed at all. I'm glad I bought it for $20, because that's all it's worth.If you want a game that will last long and provide you with weeks worth of entertainment buy Soul Calibur II. Extremely awesome graphics, no blood, great adventure mode, excellent game, 5 stars."
2,I'm sick of Mortal Kombat,"Ever since 1993, (10 years now) Midways been spitting these games out. Theyre decent fighting games, plagued with mindless, unneeded blood and gore. While there are many gory games out there, at least their gore makes some kind of sence. As for this game, it makes no sence at all. When you punch your friend in the arm blood does not go squirting in all directions does it? A mediocre fighting title that tries to be orignal by adding blood and gore."
4,MORTAL KOMBAT ON GAMECUBE,I can't wait to get the game on gamecube I have MORTAL KOMBAT TRILIGY on nintendo64 I hope MORTAL KOMBAT Deadly Alliance is as good as MORTAL KOMBAT TRILIGY.
2,A Horrible Game Dont Buy It!,"This is a awful game. If you want a colorful and I dont mean bloody game, then get Super Mario Sunshine which is great for children under 8 years of age and any adult or teenager who inst afraid to admit they still, in fact, enjoy Barney and Disney Movies. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I heard you can turn the blood off which makes it still violent but makes it bearable for people over 30."
5,Awesome,Exactly what I needed. Order was right the first time. Just find the fatality codes online and your ready.
2,Not full movie. Portions are cut out.,"I had really wanted the full movie. There are bits and pieces of the movie which are cut out & I was very disappointed by this. Some are small parts, like Anil Kapoor speaking to the Inspector Sahib when Manav leaves the airport waiting area where Mansi and her sisters, in the theatre edition he turns to the Inspector and wants to know what kind of security allows a man to come in, and then leave again, without being stopped? It's a small part, but I bought the DVD because I wanted to see the full movie, otherwise I would have just watched it on YouTube."
5,Great product,I All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter worked great on my trip to the UK and it worked with all the appliances that we traveled with.
5,Very nice adapter,"Very nice, very convenient.Note for the person who tried to use their blow dryer with it: this is an *adapter*, not a *converter*. Many US blowdryers only work on 120V, and most of those that support 220V have a switch to choose which allows the user to select which voltage to use. My guess is that your host contry used 220, and you burned out your blowdryer."
1,Does Not Accept 3-pronged U.S. Plugs!,"This adapter does not accept 3-pronged U.S. plugs! There are some reviews for this product which indicate it does work with these plugs. Those reviews are WRONG!!! It is inexcusable to design an adapter like this that does not accept 3-pronged plugs, that's why I'm giving it just one star. This is also the first time in a decade I've been disappointed with Amazon, their product description should make it very clear that this adapter accepts two-pronged plugs only."
3,3-prongs?,"I should have read all the reviews. I just didn't even think about needing three prongs. I could not charge my computer with this item. Fortunately, most of the hotels I stayed in (in Southeast Asia) had sockets that worked with American devices. I was stuck when I didn't have this option."
2,Mechanical Challenges,"The form factor on this gem is fantastic! However, the adapter will not accept a three prong, grounded plug. The plug will go in after using much force. It worked fine for 2 insertions. After that, the internal fuse blew. The spare was used and the fuse blew again. Finally, I threw the adapter away. I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to use a grounded plug."
2,Failed in less than a week,"This unit looks great, but it does not accept 3-prong US so it's not very useful for a laptop power supply and not only that, but it also failed to function about halfway through a 2-week European trip, meaning I needed to replace it at the airport. Neither convenient or well made enough to stand up for a single trip."
3,Hope this was merely defective,"Bought this product for an exchange student from Germany living in my home. Was easy to use out of the box, but is no longer working after about 4 weeks. Will be returning for replacement."
1,Did not work!,I tried to use the adapter in 4 different outlets in Germany. It did not work in any of them. I plug in a roommate's adapter into all 4 outlets and her adapter worked. It was disappointing to find out when I was out of the country.
4,lightweight travel essential,"I owned this product previously. I bought it before i moved to Paris in 2006 for my laptop. It was great but due to overuse i suppose the plug become worn for the France adapter. Then my young cousin borrowed it and broke it. The sliding mechanism broke and was unable to slide back into itself in order to use another country.However, now in 2009, back from living in New Zealand, I needed an adapter to charge the camera I had bougth there. It works great. I will be just a little more careful with this one.The great thing about it is that it is not heavy at all , like other adapters."
2,"Good Design, Cheap Prodcut","I love the design for this adapter. I travel a lot all over Europe and South America and it was nice to have an adapter so small with so many options. However, it only lasted a week before it stopped working and that's the only reason I'm not leaving a 5xStart!"
1,unbelievable,"This would really be a nice product, that is if you never have to plug in a grounded device, such as a laptor recharger. It only accepts two prongs!"
1,did not work in India,"Did not work in India. I traveled to Gujarat, city of Vadodara. I had some limited success using this product in the New Delhi airport coffee bar, but not once did it work once in Vadodara. If you are going to India, use a different product."
1,"Piece of Junk, Do Not Buy","I bought this adapter for international travel.It never worked.It arrived DOA, although I only found that out after it was too late.I was very lucky in my travels to be in places that had plugs that were US friendly and electronics with 110-240 transformers.Avoid, do not buy. You are better off with the Radio Shack plug adapters.Buyer Beware!"
1,look like multiple functional but not working,"I had bought this item due to good review before I went to a trip to Bulgaria. However, it plugs in but doesn't work. Why? I don't know. how should I deal with it now? Is it a defect one? I have no idea, to me I just lost 17 dollars for an experience. (don't buy electronic items from a book store, even it's cheaper) Fortunate I also bought Targus travel adaptor set that save me."
1,Don't buy this,I used it once and when I went to recharge my cell phone in Paris it didn't work at all causing me to have to call the states with my credit card and costing a small fortune- Horrible product!
3,"Convenient, but flawed.","Although the all-in-one converter is very practical, I'm afraid that it's a bit too flimsy for some of the heavier adapters for phones and computers. It would not charge my phone, for example."
4,"Works, But Not For Blow Dryers","I recently purchased the adapter for my trip to Europe. The first time I used it, I used it on my blow dryer. It worked for about five seconds until my blow dryer made really weird noises. I was too afraid to plug in my flat iron because I didn't want to fry it like my blow dryer. There are very little directions or instructions on the package to warn you against using the adapter with items such as blow dryers. When I came back to the U.S. and tried my blow dryer, it didn't work anymore. But I did use the adapter to plug in my video camera to charge, and it worked just fine. I also charged my PSP Player. It worked great. The only other complaint is that the adapter is pretty loose on the outlet. I wasn't sure if it was going to stay put while it charged. But overall, I would recommand this item as long as you don't use it for a blow dryer."
2,There has been some debate...,"but this will not work with 3 prong plugs. UNLESS you want to CRAM it in there so hard that you can't get it out without the thing almost coming apart. It's such a great sized adapter too, but it had to go back."
1,Better Option,I bought this device thinking I would save money over buying multiple plug adapters for Germany and Australia... big mistake. I found that I could buy single plug adapters for each country for just $.99 each.
1,Not very small adapter,"This adapter is certainly not small. It is large because it is an all-in-one, which sounds good, but in reality doesn't cut it. It is so big that it sometimes will fall out of sockets. The internal fuse also blew-out when I was overseas rendering it useless. I am now using the much smaller regional adapters which can be purchased at Office Depot or Staples for $3-4."
1,CRAP,"As someone else stated, WILL NOT WORK WITH 3 PRONGED, GROUNDED PLUGS. How ridiculous. Of course, my laptop's ac adapter has three prongs, like many others, so it will not work with this. Also, when traveling abroad, the trick is to bring a power bar so you can plug in multiple devices at once, where only one travel adapter is needed for the power bar itself. Unfortunately, most all power bars have 3 Prongs, so it won't work with them either.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid."
1,Shoddy construction,"This same design is sold by several companies, and has two major drawbacks:* European-style plugs come with prongs of varying thickness, including some where the thickness varies thoughout the length of the prong. This adapter is only able to handle the thickest ones when excessive force is applied and the mechanism will cause the thinnest ones to stuck so that you can not pull them off;* The adapter consists of two parts which are linked in a fragile way, a break is almost certain to happen."
5,A Practical and Convenient Adapter to Carry on in All your Trips,"If you travel overseas you will definitively love this adapter. Unlike other travel adapters that have several pieces that you need to carry around, this has all the plug connectors integrated into one compact self contained cylindrical unit in which you select the type of plug used in the country you are visiting. Absolutely the most practical unit I have used. It is also safe to use since it has a built-in fuse.This may seems obvious but you need to know that this device does not convert the voltage so don't plug your electronic devices unless its power units states that the Input voltage ranges from 110 to 240 VAC @ 50-60 Hz (probably the most common around Europe, Asia and America).Absolutely a most have if you travel with your laptop, digital camera, cell phone and other suitable devices."
1,disappointed that it doesn't fit power outlets in INDIA,I have read a review that says this product also works in INDIA but came to know that neither of the given 4 different power plugs doesn't fit indian power outlets.
1,think twice,"I bought this item for my trip to China. It did not work. Luckily the hotels that we stayed in had an adapter we could use. I called Kensington about my adapter, and they said I could return it and would refund my money since they have a 90 day return policy. I bought the adapter in September and sent it certified mail within their time frame. This is currently January and have not heard from them. My advise to those thinking of using it for China. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,Worked great....til the fuse blew,"I need plug converters almost every day. Another colleague recommended this unit for price, functions and the benefits of tax free and free shipping as a Prime member.I have been very please for months and even my 3 prong plugs worked. I noticed an older review said they did not, so either I am lucky or this design was improved.Loved the unit, until the fuse blew. I cannot locate a replacement fuse so pretty soon I will have to throw this unit away it seems."
1,did not work,"on my last trip my friend had one she bought on the plane and it worked great. I bought this one recently, went overseas and it did not work... then came back and found out that the return window had expired... so basically paid for something that didn't work and can't even get my money back on top of the huge inconvenience given I hadn't brought with many the many adapters I used to carry with me... very, very unhappy!!!"
2,broken after only a few use,I only used it a few times in the span of about three months and it just not working anymore. I have no idea what is wrong
1,Piece of Junk,"This thing is a piece of junk. I would have rated it zero stars if possible. I took it to Italy and it worked about 5 minutes. This is a plug adapter and should be a very somple device. Using the plug that fits in Italy's two-prong 220-240 V recepticle, the 110-120 V 60Hz/220-240 V (50Hz) cell phone charger worked maybe five minutes. I checked it to be sure that the adapter plug end was properly positioned and properly locked in place - which it was. I tried a couple of other low voltage devices set to operate in duel voltage and it would not work. I messed with it for quite a while and could never get it to make an electrical connection - we stayed in several locations and it would not work - period. It was never overloaded (cell phone charger) - it's a huge waste of money and this thing was very expensive for it's intended purpose. If you need foreign adapters, buy a kit with the individual plug adapters - you will save money and frustration."
5,Very Helpful,This product was very helpful on my recent trip to Australia. I used it the whole time I was there and was integral to the use of my electronic appliances down there. I would recommend this to anyone who is travelling overseas. It also works in Europe and the UK.
3,not compatible with the plugs of Dell Laptop,"I may be wrong, but the plug adapter is not compatible with the 3-pronged plugs of Dell laptops. I cannot insert the laptop plugs into this adapter.Did I purchase a defect product or what?"
1,did not work at all,"I was hoping to do a lot with such a product. however, it didn't work either with small devices such as cellphones and cameras nor big ones. It seems great product but unfortunately it deserves this star because there is no zero star."
1,Did not work in the UK,"Stayed at two hotels in the UK and this device did not work in either one. Would love to get a refund of this piece of junk. I have a number of other Kensington products, all of which work reasonable well, so this is a particular disappointment. Luckily for me, both hotels had built-in US plugs."
1,Does not work as advertised...or at all,"As I have found it, these all in one packages do not work well. Especially this one. Tried using it in Germany, and it failed. Yes, it was a problem that it does not work with three pronged plugs, but it was a bigger problem that it wouldn't even work with two pronged. I tried everything, and I know it isn't a voltage problem."
5,A Traveler's Dream,Another reviewer had said not to purchase this item because it's heavy and falls out of the wall socket. I'm glad that I ignored that review and decided to purchase this item anyway. It is GREAT! It has all of the international plug converters in one unit and it's not really THAT heavy. I have had no problems with it falling out of sockets. This product is really convenient and I highly recommend it!
5,Kensington International Plug Adapter,This multi-plug adapter works great. It is an awesome help and security on every journey around the world. I constantly have it with me becacause it is small and fits in every bag.
4,Works Great... but it's a very tight fit for 3 pronged US plugs,"I used this for my trip to China and it worked fine for both plug types in use over there. It is very convenient to have an all in one power adapter without worrying about losing seperate power adapter pieces. Remember, this doesn't convert voltage. Check your devices to see if they'll handle 110-240V. If they do, this will work fine. It worked with my cell phone charger, laptop, camera battery chargers, and shaver.I have two issues with this item though:1) If you have a 3 pronged US plug, it will be a very tight fit. You're basically have to jam the round ground plug into a rectangle. After struggling to jam the plug in, you'll feel like you're nearly breaking the unit when you pull the plug out. It honestly might be easier getting a 3 to 2 prong adapter for a dollar or two at your local store.2) The instruction manual that came with my adapter was for a different Kensington model that had an included USB port."
4,Worked for my UK External Hard Drive,"I recently was shipped an external hard drive from the UK. But the power adapter did not include US-style plugs (type A). And I live in the US. This handy travel plug adapter plugs into any of 4 different plug styles, and most important for me, it accepts all of them as well! So I can plug this into US-style plugs and plug UK appliances into it and vice-versa. The travel plug adapter does not alter the properties of the power signal, so I expect the appliance's adapter has to be nimble enough to accept either 110 or 220, but in this case my external hard drive did just fine."
4,"works as advertised, but could it be smaller?","I brought it so far to Germany (Type C/F) Turkey (Type C/F), and Australia (Type-I). Used with Type-A (laptop adapter without the earthing prong) Worked without a problem. Just two (possibly unfair) complaints. (1) It is a bit too large (maybe not a problem for Americans). If it were made in Japan or Korea, it would be at least 100 times smaller. (2) It was not firmly stuck. Especially, if there is a switch near the plug, because the size is too large, the adapter conflicts with the switch and the switch prevents the adapter to be firmly stuck. But at least it worked so I do not complain. I would buy another one if it were smaller, but not."
2,please explain how this device works with three prongs?,there are several reviews that say this does work with three prong laptop plugs. I can't figure it out so can someone explain? I have a Mac and the plug doesn't seem to want to fit it.
4,Sweet!,"The product works well and is very convenient. You will want to get an adapter plug if you have a ground (3 prong) plug on your electronics. I actually didn't have to use it much, since most of my electronics were capable of 100-240V. Most international hotels have a plug for the standard US 2 prong plugs so I didn't always need the adapter."
5,worked well in 3 countries with different outlets,It worked well for me with 3 different types of electrical outlet. It's well-built.
1,Adapter,"Wrong adapter, not satisfied with order at all!!!!Was supposed to get an adapter for us-everywhere else but got opposite"
5,happy,this was a good purchase and it worked well for my won while in Africa. It supported his computer and other items with no problem. good price
5,Travel Adapter,"Wasn't sure what i would need for a trip from the US to Peru. Read a review on this travel adapter. it worked out wonderfully. no problems for lower wattage items (computers, ipods, etc.). not for use with higher wattage items such as hair dryers and such. very easy to use. does not convert voltage, so make sure your appliance can take the higher voltage (it usually is written right on the appliance, something like 110/220 V). Small and light for travel. perfect."
2,worked one week,"Nice product but it worked only 1 week with my 90W laptop, then blew the fuse. Should ship with an extra fuse."
1,Doesn't work with 3 prong outlets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I should have read all of the reviews. I bought this for my computer for a business trip recently. When I got to Europe, I pulled it out and it didn't work with my plug! Good thing I had bought a universal igo converter for the plane, because I was able to use it for the trip. Very disappointing!"
3,Not for New Zealand,"The blurb says that this works for over 150 countries, so I called tech support who couldn't tell me a thing (other than the weather in Delhi). Even so, based on their promise of a money back guarantee, I bought it and set off for New Zealand & Fiji. The bottom line is that the adapter worked except when I encountered the miniature version of a Kiwi wall plug. Also, all the plugs in the adapter are *non* grounded. If you need grounded versions for you computer etc. it is best to look in the country you travel to. I couldn't find any in the US at all."
1,Always take 2!,"This one broke on the 2nd day. Luckily, I took another model with me as well so I wasn't stranded. Ended up buying another one on the plane. I like the all in one feature though."
1,"ONLY for two-prong ungrounded use, incompatible in some European countries","This is an old design that has two significant flaws.On the input, as others have noted, it only accepts unpolarized two-prong plugs. No polarized plugs, no three-prong grounded plugs.The European adapter is an odd shape although perhaps it would fit. BUT it is the older ungrounded European plug. This will not work in grounded European sockets.This should be made clear in the product description.I'm returning it."
1,FAULTY PLUG ADAPTER--DO NOT BUY,"do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!I PURCHASED THIS PLUG ADAPTER FOR MY TRIP TO EUROPE AND THE MOMENT I PLUGGED MY MAC CHARGER IN, THE FUSE INSIDE THE ADAPTER BLEW.I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS. THEY SELL FAULTY DEVICES AND HAVE INCONVENIENCED ME THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF MY TRIPtalk about a stressful first three days. i took my adapter to an electronics store and the worker tried 5 new fuses in the adapter (with a camera charger plugged in). one by one, my plug adapter blew every single fuse. I'm telling you, please don't ever buy this product, save yourself the hassle it caused me"
1,Not universal and no 3 prong plug,"I just returned from China. While there I had to request an adapter from about 1/2 of the hotels because this one didn't fit. Also, while you can force a 3 prong plug into it, it is too difficult to do and then remove for this to be considered usuable for a 3 prong plug. I wouldn't buy again and depending on the cost and trouble may return this one."
3,"Good, but only for a 2 prong/non-grounded plug","Very good at accomodating the outlets you will need to plug into in various countries. It falls short in that it only will accept a plug that has two prongs or a non-grounded plug. I confirmed this with Kensington support. I ended up returning it and buyingTripshell International TR-Adap-BK Travel Plug Adapter With Surge Protection, Retail Package (Black)"
4,Great Travel Adapter,"This adapter worked great. It was nice having an adapter for several formats in one device. Fits multiple formats in, multiple formats out. Compact size allows it to fit into a shoe when packing. One improvement would be to have a listing of countries next to each sliding switch, but I guess you figure that out when you try to insert the plug into a receptacle. That's the only point keeping it from being 5 stars."
1,Does not support 3 prongs,"Similar to other consumers, I found out too late that this does NOT support electronics (i.e. your beloved computer) that have 3 prongs. Found out when I was already abroad - such a shame and waste of money. I had more success using the $7.99 adapter I purchased in the Target travel section under the ""Target Home"" brand."
2,This does not work with a grounded (3 plug) US male,"I regret not having read the reviews. If you want to use a grounded (3-pronged) US male connector into the female part of this converter, fuggetabout it.If you believe you'll never need to insert a grounded plug, it seems fine...fairly compact and sturdy."
3,"Good travel adapter, though a little pricy","This is a good travel adapter, though it is a bit too pricy, a $2 adapter from ebay works just as well. Unless you really like the shape of this adapter, I recommend get a cheaper one instead."
2,Doesn't work for grounded plugs!!!,"It does what it needs to do for standard 2-prong devices, but if you have a 3-pronged USA grounded plug, you're out of luck. The bottom opening where the rounded ground would be is too small/narrow and typical plugs won't fit. I'd look elsewhere."
5,Nice compact adapter,"I like the all-in-one feature of this device. No searching the bag for the right adapter, just slide the one you need out and you are good to go.This really came in handy for me on a recent trip to Amsterdam. The only part that was a bummer, was that it didn't support the 3 prong plug from the US. I had the monster travel power strip with me and couldn't use it with this adapter."
3,All-in-One Travel Adapter,Worked just as advertized. Very compact way to take adapters for more than one country on the asme trip!
1,Not a quality product.,"I bought this adapter for a trip to Egypt. It fit in the Egyptian outlet ok. I used it once to charge my camera batteries, it worked fine. Next I used it with my hair dryer and it would not work at all and it hasn't worked since. For the price, it should work longer than one use. I would be very wary about purchasing this product."
2,Not a voltage converter,"This is a nice plug adapter but it's NOT a voltage converter. My laptop, camera and gadget chargers worked excellent with 220 volts. I wasn't so lucky with my wife's curling iron and hair dryer. Telling her she looks great is no substitute, so be sure to double check her gadgets too.Some European lamp outlets are recessed into the wall, so the plug will be seated flush instead of sticking out. They are elegant and beautiful, but too small for this plug adapter.Finally, bring a power stip unless you want to move the hotel furniture each time you change a plug."
1,travel plug adapter,I am going to France and needed an adapter for my appliances. After purchasing[ASIN:B0002H4YUI Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter]] I found it would not work without another purchase of a devise to change the voltage.
4,Not eco-friendly,"One thing that really irritates me about this product, it's packages in WAY too much plastic! Think about the planet; think about future generations, about our children. This is a great product, and I would have given it 5 stars if it was packaged better. I'm dropping a star because of the amount of plastic used, rating this 4 stars."
3,Plug adapter,"Looks good, response was excellent. I haven't used it yet so I think this review is a little pre-mature."
1,Stopped working after three minutes.,"I bought this for a trip to Italy. My wife used it with her blow dryer for the first time and after about three minutes it died. For five days we thought it was her blow dryer. My wife was on the verge of trashing her dryer. We found out later that it was the adapter and not her dryer. We bought a really cheap adapter for two euros and she was able to use her blow dryer with out a problem for the rest of the trip. Since we took the instructions with us, and followed everything it said, I'm hoping we can return the product. We also double checked to make sure that the voltage on the dryer was set correctly.I wouldn't waste my time or money on this product."
3,It is what it is,"If you are looking for a cheap polo style shirt, this is it. The quality is OK and the look is acceptable. Nothing to scream about but for the price, you will find nothing better."
2,Not satisfied,"The shirt I bought was XXL for a reason... I am fat. While it fit just fine in my chest, The stomach area was narrow."
3,Bigger than expected,"Contrary to many people here my shirt was bigger that expected. I ordered Medium, but it is even bigger than an L, possibly close to an XL size!"
1,Not recommented,I have never got such a bad purchase from Amazon. Offcourse I was attracted by the brand and the price. The shirt was having a real bad sizing. It was not large or medium while ordered for a large one. It still is haning in my closet and is useless.The design looks as if at the first look itself it can be identified as a discontinued model or design or something.Do not waste your money on this.
5,Ellie loves these,My dog Ellie is allergic to chicken so I have to be very careful what she eats. These are perfect for her. I give her the venison and the beef. They are soft so they do not upset her digestive system. Most importantly she loves them so they make a great training treat.
4,"My dog loves this, but beware there are different sizes available","My elderly dog who has pretty much given up on food really loves these treats. They are pieces of beef jerky about 3/4 by 1 inch. I have purchased these before from a local pet store and they are pretty pricy. I purchased them from Amazon but didn't realize these were a smaller size that what I had before. These are 3/4 by about 1/4. Of course you can always give more, but my dog really liked chewing apart the larger pieces."
5,My dog scarfs these up,"My cairn terrier was never much for treats (he prefers toys), but these changed his mind. Now he comes running every time I even go near the treat cabinet.As someone else mentioned, the price is a little steep, but they're not full of garbage like most store-bought treats are and they make my boy happy, and there's no putting a price on that."
5,Awesome treats!,My pup can't have anything with grains in it and these treats are just what I needed to use for training. He loves them!!
3,Good stuff,"Naturally, pooch scarfed this up. What's not to like, other than it costs a bit more than the fake processed junk you normally get on the store shelf."
5,sony a100,"There was a lot of good information about the camera which told me i could take pictures of things that other camera could not.If one does not look good , delete it change some setting and take it again.Or just take a few shots and chage setting to get it set up for in invierment you are taking pictures in.."
4,Good for an amatuer,"I bought this camera becuase I am a life long Minolta fan, however they discontinued their cameras without any notice and I was stuck with alot of Konica Minolta camera equipment. Sony picked up Minolta's pattons and made their first DSLR and everything I owed with Minolta is interchangeable with it. But I run 2 photo studios and I have not been happy with the controls, etc. of this camera. However a person who just wants a better camera to take better pictures then their snap and shoot--this would be a good camera for you, for a professional however--no. I am now switching everything over to Nikon."
3,"good camera, however","I can't say that the pictures are worth the weight and bulk of the camera, and all the editing I have to do. It does take nice pictures, but they lack that ""wow"". I find they're kind of flat. So I sold it and bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 which I find takes excellent pictures without all the tinkering, but you can tinker if you want.I guess if you're a professional, you can get excellent pictures out of this Sony Alpha A100, but it would take alot of tinkering , and for the price, weight and bulk, and editing, it's just not worth it to me."
4,Sony DSLR A-100,I bought this camera because of the fact that it was the old Konica/Minolta Maxxum 5D. I have spent money on Maxxum AF lenses and did not want to throw them away or collect dust. They work fine even the 50mm stock lense that came with the Maxxum 7000 that I started with. I have shot some photos using the old lenses and the new one that came with the camera (18-70mm). I like the camera very much and it fits really nice in my hands. I have not had the chance to really push the limits of the camera but I really don't do that anyway...so the camera fits my needs.
4,Sony A100H,"Great service, product arrived in perfect condition, Now I just need to learn how to use it."
4,Amazon.com a disgraceful,"Amazon.com has in what I consider the worst ordering system on the internet. If an order goes astray and if you are able to contact their sales personel you will probably be told that they cannot give you any information and that the item or items will be handled by a secret organization within their company and no one has access to them or their phone number. Think Im kidding, try it. In my opinion this company is in a moronic state and of course run by morons.The camera is very good, and I had to pay more money as a result of their incompetance."
1,Timelapse recording,"This camera has not timelapse recording!!!(Cameras with a time lapse feature can be programmed to automatically shoot a number of frames over a period of time or with a certain time interval between each frame. For instance, a camera on a tripod in time lapse mode could be set up to shoot frames of a flower opening or a bird building a nest.)"
4,Solid entry-level camera,The A100 is discontinued and has been replaced by the A200 / A300. But it's still a solid entry-level camera. At one time you could land one at Best Buy in the $250 range. Definitely don't pay full price for one of these. Check eBay or Craigslist.
4,Instant Photographer,"Sony Alpha A100H 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-200mm f3.5-6.3 LensThe camera arrived in time for an important family wedding. Out of the box and in automatic mode the pictures are crisp and vibrant, even in low light conditions. The steady shot feature, built in to the body, is only available in more expensive SLR camaeras, and then only in really expensive lenses. After a month I have excersized many of the features this camera has to offer. I am quite pleased with its capabilities and it has renewed my passion for photography. Colors are reproduced quite well, with the exception of purple flowers, such as petunia, that are rended blue - curious anomally I am still trying to get to the bottom of."
5,Very good DSLR!,"Fast Focus even in low light condition, accurate metering, very low noise even @ ISO400, and very good resolution (APS-C and 10MP)The best is I can use all my old maxxum lenses on this camera."
3,disappointing,"yes, the roots are a great live band. but this live album is disappointing. the songs are done incredibly SLLOOOWWW and therefore the whole thing suffers from a lack of energy. in fact, unless you are getting the double cd version - with the fantastic songs ""what you want"" and ""lesson, pt 3 (its over now)"" - you are better served by spending your money on a tickets to see the roots and leaving this one on the rack."
2,theres a reason why most rap artists dont put out live album,"I love the roots. i dont listen to rap that much but i find them to be a very ecletic and organic rap group in a world today full of rap stars only in it for the money and girls. but this album, which is almost like a greatest hits collection live- there is a reason why most rap artists never put out live albums. the sound quality just isnt there. i love things fall apart, but the version live of the next movement sounds hardly anything like the album version. the quality isnt that great. im sure its alot different if you see them live in concert- im sure its spectacular. but just rap in general- it just doesnt sound as good live."
4,Talent...pure and simple,"Hip Hop is notorious for short shows over canned beats. The Roots have the talent and love of all music, not only Hip Hop, to sustain a live album.A good documentation of the world's best Hip Hop band and the studio tracks on the 2nd disc are killer too."
4,solid but not brilliant,"the new roots joint has some of the old classics and many live cuts from ""things fall apart"", it's good to finally capture some of that live sound although it's not the same as being there. definitely very sold but not quite 5 stars"
4,Rooty-Tooty Fresh and Fruity,"The Roots have outdone themselves this time. I have not bought the album yet, but I am salivating with eager desire in anticipation of this compilation. Their first three albums were indubidably among the best of the hip-hop genre, but unfortunately, their fourth paled in comparison. So, I know that this fifth one will be on point and represent the true hip-hop element and nature of the roots. If it helps, the sound of the Roots can be visualized as many men simultaneously springing in every direction on a trampoline -- and this is rivaled by no one else in the business (except maybe by the Black Eyed Peas). So, for all of you out there who want to open your ears to a fresh, new sound, this is the sound for you (that means you, Marc)."
5,Wrightson's Frankenstein is the ultimate version of the book,"No one will doubt that Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is a classic of horror fiction. It shows the horrific result when a man tries to play God. But this version of Frankenstein features the chilling (but amazing) illustrations by Bernie Wrightson. He truly brings to life the self-loathing creation of Dr. Frankenstein, with his gory appearance and enraged expressions. He expertly renders the landscapes of France and Germany, where the book takes place. These illustrations compliment perfectly Shelly's tale of the struggle between the man and his monster. A must for any Illustration student or horror fan. Definitely buy a copy. Buy two, in case you lose one."
1,Missing pages,"The first 50 pages, or four chapters, are missing from this etext. I found another version without missing pages free on Amazon."
1,Started in the middle,"After I flipped past the cover, I found myself in the middle. I wasn't sure until I reached the second chapter, ""Chapter V.""Maybe someone didn't proof this before posting? I found another version of the book and it stated with a title page as I expected."
3,upgrades available,these songs have been upgraded a couple times or morenice set - but get one of the upgrades instead!!
5,The Most original work on management ever written,"Peter Drucker needs no introduction. His works have shaped the management thought and philosophy for the last half a century. What he discusses in this volume, other management thinkers will find only 40 years later. A must read for understanding- What management and business is all about."
5,The origin of most of today's best sellers,"It's really susprising how a book dated 54 can be so modern. Throughout its pages you can see paragraphs that simply are the source of many later killing books. Mac Gregor's theory, Hertzberg's ergonomic factor, the vision of Ted Levitt about marketing myopia, the search for simplicity, the moder concept of ethical behavior of companies and so many others. Really amazing how Drucker already peeked on these points many years ago. what new have all those new gurus been speaking about?.Nevertheless, the most striking issue it's his lookout for human vertues in managers. Integrity anf character are the main tools of the right manager. We are still on the search for them!!!."
4,works freat for itch,I bought this product years ago for a sore back but soon discovered that it is great to stop itching. I have pruritis(severe itching) and this product provides immediate relief.
4,This really works!,"I'm very satisfied with Stopain. It was recommended to me and I was doubtful if it would really take the pain away, but it does!"
2,Good reference for begining owner-handlers,"There are some interesting points and good information for beginners to this sport. However, few new tips for intermediate or advanced handlers. Also written from the perspective of a professional handler rather than an owner-handler."
5,NOT FOR THE NOVICE OR BEGINNER!!!,"This is a detailed book designed to guide you through your Speciality dogs' campaigning. This is not a book made to help class dogs win in the breed ring. This is written especially for Group 1's and Best In Show wins. I highly recommend reading this book before attending one of his seminars to be prepared what and what not to ask. This author has had mulitple BIS dogs in his resume' and has a unlimited wealth of knowledge in the sport. This book can teach you everything from installing fear into your competition, to getting the photographer to take the kind of picture YOU want. This is the best book on the market for the Advanced Owner-Handler or Professional Handler."
5,DogRead Book of the Month,"DogRead book of the month July, 200o This book was chose to be on the prestigious 'DogRead' as a book selection of the month. We only do 12 books a year. The author comes on line for the whole month to answer questions on the book. George was very well recieved and his book recieved rave reviews. We found it easy to follow and great for the newbe or the long time owner. It was very well received by our 3000 member email group. The author was very knowledgeable and easy to understand.treshell owner DogRead"
2,Great book for beginners--but not directed to owner-handlers,"There are some interesting points and good information for beginners to this sport. However, few new tips for intermediate or advanced handlers. Also written from the perspective of a professional handler rather than an owner-handler."
2,DON'T BUY IT,"I'm not sure who the intended audience is for this book. If you don't already know the terminology of dog showing (such as stacking, gaiting, baiting, etc.) and are truly a novice, you will be clueless. If you already know these terms, the book does not tell you at all how to practice or perform them correctly. There is a section at the end with helpful hints (e.g., suck on a mint if you are anxious as it will hide the adrenaline smell in your saliva from the dog), but otherwise, I found it not very helpful..."
2,Check it out from the library.,"This book is definately for beginner show handlers. The book is an extremely quick read with very few ""secrets"". Anyone who has taken a beginning handling course from someone who has shown dogs would learn just as much or more than what this book offers.The book is worth reading, but I would pick it up at your local library and read it in a night or two. Not worth adding this to your collection."
1,I wouldn't waste my money,"I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.If you really want a good book read: ""Making it to Westminster"" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down!"

5,"This ""Spoke"" to Me","I had yet to hear anything by Mercy Me - my sister received their other cd for Christmas, though I hadn't heard anything off of it, when at a youth retreat this past week I heard ""Word of God Speak"" and it really ""spoke"" to me. After finding out from the right person who the artist was, I picked up the cd and now look forward to hearing their other release. If it's anything like this one, I am sure to be pleased. Beautiful lyrics, uplifting music, gorgeous harmonies and backgrounds. It's great christian music."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Up To ""Almost There""","There is nothing wrong with this CD, and the lyrics in particular are uplifting and excellent. However, the music just *isn't* as awesome as ""Almost There"". The music in particular seems to lack the fire of their previous release. I can honestly say that there wasn't one single song on ""Almost There"" that I didn't just LOVE listening to over and over. With this release, the songs are pleasant but I find them fading into the background when I listen - more like nice muzak than something inspiring me to a closer relationship with God.I hate to write a less than glowing review of anything from this band - they've been so meaningful and helpful in my own spiritual development - but this CD just isn't alight like ""Almost There"" was. Again, there isn't anything _wrong_ with it, its just hard to live up to the one that came before I guess."
5,Great disk,"I enjoyed this one very much, some very melodic pieces paired with some really strong rock feeling songs.A good buy."
5,Brilliant,"The opening line of the title track 'Spoken for' moved me - 'take this world from me... to hear u say this one's mine ...'The track Crazy, shook me, very deep - 'how can I find hope in dying ?'.The track 'Word of God Speak' is just too inspiring - these boys are really devoted to their God.The track 'Love of God' is purely devotional. His love 'reaches to the lowest hell' indeed - what a mighty God we serve !!All in all a great album, composed of really deep lyrics. May the Lord continue to bless these unlikely lads. Amen."
5,I LOVED it!,"I'm in the UK so the only way I can get ahold of mercyme CDS is when I make my trips across the ""pond"". I was captured by them during my first stay, with ""I can only imagine"". I watched the dove awards and KNEW they would win.On my return this year, I was delighted to find another album for me to take back with me.The songs are just....they speak to me, they let me know that God loves me unconditonally and they allow me to play them while I have ""non-Christians"" in the car because they are not preachy, they're not typical worship songs...I even get one of my friends who's not a believer and normally avoids this kind of thing singing along!Thank you Mercy Me!"
5,way cool!!!!!!!!!!!,"this album is awesome!heres what i think of each song...the change inside of me 10/10 awesome!all the above 7/10 so -so.spoken for 9/10 great title tune!there's a reason 4/10 too slow for my taste.come ,come all 10/10 very upbeat!crazy 10/10 awesome message!word of god speak 8/10 fair.glory goes on 7/10 not too goodlove of god 9/10 a very good song.go 10/10 love it!!!!all because of this 2/10 too short!theres my comments!see ya next review!"
5,Solid work of music,"This album is consistently great from beginning to end. The singing is smooth and easy to listen and sing along with, and the melodies run from traditional ballads to more of a pop feel. All in all, they have done each song it's justice and listeners will not be disappointed. The song ""Work of God Speak"" is a quiet prayer and leaves me inspired each time I hear it. My favorite song on the CD has to be ""Crazy"" and the wonderful message of contradtictions it mirrors. I also like ""The Change Inside of Me"" and find it quite a lift. This CD will inspire you on even your most dreary of days."
4,Good Cd,I like this cd very much. I actually like it more than Almost There. I have been a MM fan for years and have loved all of their albums even before this. I like the title cut from this one very much. No two CDs are alike and we need to remeber that. This is a good cd and you should add it to your library.
4,For something that needs to be kept 'germ free'....,"this item certainly was not packaged with any consideration of hygiene. As a matter of fact, it was not 'packaged' at all. Thus, we have a combination of Chinese (country of origin) germs, Amazon germs and middleman germs. At the very least, this brush should have been packed in a cheap plastic bag. Not a very auspicious start for this highly rated item..."
4,Nice but....,"I have two of these brushes,they are very comfortable & easy to use.I havent had any problems with the handle but i have had problems with the bristles. I always have to check & recheck that i have gotten all the bristles that have fallen out.I have baked a cake & decorated it only to find bristels in it.Although i know what they are ,if their not found in the pan before putting your batter in, someone could think it was a hair.A really thick hair but you wouldnt want someone to find one in your cooking."
1,Ruined my Baklava!,I made the BEST baklava - which was ruined by the bristles that fell out. All that work to be negated by this brush! I'm sticking with silicone from now on.
2,E for effort?,The 90s ended just a mere 6 yrs ago... and for sure there's still dust settling... leave it alone and try again anytime after 2010
3,It's ok,"It's ok if you like the latest 90's pop, I wasn't totally impressed with it, but I did like some of the songs."
2,Music excellent - Packaging the worst EVER,"The music on this CD was excellent (4 stars), but the packaging concept is the absolute worst in the history of music (0 stars) - the cover is a clear baggie of moldy coffee beans that smell like something died and was left laying in the sun. It permeates the entire CD and will the smell will take over the rest of your CDs. I don't know Rhino was thinking this time, but it didn't work. I wish they would have come out with alternative packaging. I'm trying to decide if it is bad enough to return the CD."
1,Amazingly bad,Planned a road trip just for the purpose of listening to this box set... just as I had done for the great 70s and 80s Rhino boxes. I cannot believe how bad this is - particularly how unrepresentative of the decade it is. PLEASE Rhino - try again.
2,too much trash....not enough treasure,"im usually a big fan of the 80s music (thats when MTV used to play videos )the 90s decade was musically ruined by garage bands that couldnt sing for ****. quite to the contrary, the 90s had some decent songs .... its just not featured on this box set (whatever)"
2,General lameness.,"This set pretty much sucks.The lamest collection of songs from the '90's that you're ever gonna hear, sounding like they were taken from 3rd generation sources.On top of that, the book inside features various wankers who try to sound glib and ironic, but still end up sounding like they should be writing for a Time-Life collection (with the exception of the Sub Pop founder).On top of it all, and this really gets me, the material describing the events of the decade in a timeline format, on top of being generally lame, is written AND edited as if by a non-native English speaker, which a) makes it hard to read, and b) contributes to a general feeling of shoddiness. Not what you want from a hundred-dollar investment, is it?I'm really surprised at Rhino; I'm usually a big fan of their collections. Avoid this one."
2,Dissapointing,"I know its heresy to say a Velvet Undergorund albumm is anything except amazing but I'm going to anyway, people need to know the truth!!! I've listened to this a few times but I just remain dissapointed by it. Stephanie Says is basically a early (& inferior) version of Caroline Says 2 from Berlin with a name change for Caroline whilst She's My Best Friend, Lisa Says, Ocean & Andy's Chest are weaker versions than those Lou Reed put on his solo albums.Its not all negative though, I Can't Stand It is brilliant & with its choppy guitar interplay & good vocals could easily fit on the 3rd Velvets album. Foggy Notion is also a great song.I don't hate this album but I don't love it either but I'd say get the 4 official velvets albums & then think about if you really want this.Or tape the 5 good songs from one of your friends."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is abother re-release of Sidewalks Fences & Walls, produced by Swamp Dog... don't buy it- Solomon Burke was never paid for this recording and will NEVER perform any of the songs on it."
1,Amazon's edition has no sketches vs. 53 for original,"You would generously call this Amazon editon an oversight, otherwise it's a shameless fleecing because for the same price The University of Nebraska press edition, current, for the same price has the many sketches from the original.The Doubleday hardcover editions had five, double-paged color iillustrations, five half-tone illustrations and forty three sketches, This Amazon edition has none, which for a Charles M. Russell book is inexcusable."
2,Where are the images?,"Charles Russell's stories are second to none and fun for all ages. His art is also a big part of the experience. Tragically the ebook version does not contain any of Russell's great images. Poorly done, Kindle folks. However the literature is great."
5,Trails Plowed Under by Charles Russell,"Wonderful, expressive book of tales and happenings in the life of Western artist Charles M. Russell of Montana. Great read!!!!"
5,Ray-Ban protection,I was afraid to order these online being hesitant of fake or second hand products. I received my Ray-Bans in good condition as the description stated and love wearing them daily. Comfortable product. Will definitely shop at AMAZON again.
1,"hard back, not leatherbound","The story is as described, but the leather book binding, for which I willingly paid a premium, is the usual cloth hard cover. It's a pity that a few bad apples incorrectly describe their products on amazon since most of the time I'm thrilled with the ease of buying on line."
2,Great Clamp - High Shipping,Clamps are great. Small issues with a few but nothing unexpected. That is until you realize that the standard shipping alone is more than the product cost. $7.70 to standard ship a $6.99 product?This bear bites!! READ THE FINE PRINT FIRST.....
2,Not real happy,"I ordered the pack of 10, 4"" wire hose clamps, and when I went to tighten them the clamp ran out of adjustment and wouldn't hold the hose fermley."
5,"Johnny, Johnny, JOHNNY","I LOVE this show! Especially Anthony Michael Hall as ""Johnny"". Watch it! It's on USA."
3,Okay for TV Sci-Fi,"While this series does not capture the haunting feeling of dread that permeates the Dead Zone feature film, and Anthony Michael Hall is no Christopher Walken, it is nonetheless a good fluffy sci-fi watch. I enjoyed the whole series but one season does not stick out more than another. In fact, while an enjoyable ride, it's not a memorable series in total."
4,great series,"this is a great series, too bad it ended without anyone knowing it was going to end as soon as it did after 6 successful season runs."
3,Dead Zone gasping for air,"I'm not sure why only 3 episodes of this season were committed to the ongoing storyline of Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flannery), but that was a mistake. The remainder of the stories are pure escapism; entertaining, but no more so than any other TV show. The writers need to do a better job tying individual episodes to the real story.One of the best reoccuring themes from seasons 2 and 3 was the appearance of Frank Whaley (futureman) and of Johny's future self. They ended this story with Johny's impromptu tossing of his cane into a river. In effect, the writers threw away a formula that was working in favor of a purely mediocre series of fill-in episodes.The Dead Zone is nearing it's last gasp and there doesn't appear to be any sign of recovery. The introduction of some evil cabal behind Stillson and Rev Purdie only fuels the derailment. They need to go back to basics and focus on the true storyline of the Dead Zone without overly complicating it."
4,"Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...","Before I saw this 4th Season of Dead Zone, I read reviews from Amazon. Many panned dear Johnny's Season.So I went into the season with low expectations. Funny thing was...I was entertained just like always. Of course, some of the storylines were far-fetched. The whole concept of Dead Zone is brilliantly far-fetched (thank you Stephen King). Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing."
4,"Dead Zone, always thrilling","Wow, I have all the 4 Seasons of Dead Zone and the suspance and the stories are always well done and rich of suspance. After 4 years I can say the episodes are always at high level, well built and characters and life around John Smith are realistic.I really enjoy watching this DVD.Just one thing...there are no subtitle so it can be difficolt to understand all the words, but that's because I'm italian. I remember there were subtitle on the 1 season only."
5,"Super Strong China, good design.","I have been looking for a Tea server for awhile now, I drink a lot of high quality organic green and black tea so I needed a good high quality tea server to compliment them. This design is simple but works well. It is very strong, and easy to clean. When pouring the tea it flows nicely without making a mess. The design of the lid has a small notch on the end side of the handle which prevents the lid from falling off when pouring your tea.The quality of the china i would say is high quality. It is very smooth, and has a solid high quality feel to it. It also cleans very easily."
3,I'd like to go 3.5,"I am an ardent Mary fan, and was pleased to see this released on CD. I did not know it before: I was only familiar with the best cuts as chosen for ""Things We Said Today.""And those are indeed the cream of this collection. Those are 6 star songs. Though I don't love Way Out West, the others are absolute knockouts. Several of her most tender, most lovely, most moving songs. The ones left behind on this CD do not measure up. They are indeed weaker, and owning (or buying) ""Things We Said Today"" seems a far wiser decision.That being said, I will say the transfer on these is glorious. I have not compared side by side, but these sound a little fuller than the versions I've been enjoying for years on TWST. And there were a couple of cuts I will be enjoy having. But the overall quality is not there. And Let It Be Me and Ballad of a Wanted Man just plain ol' stink.So, buy lots of Mary. Just get the Greatest Hits version instead."
3,More Than A One-Hit Wonder,"Amii Stewart had huge popularity with her remake of ""Knock On Wood."" It was not an especially great record but it did have attention-getting punch and worked well on the radio. Subsequent efforts to repeat the remake magic failed (""Light My Fire,"" ""The Letter""), but on her albums were tracks that were different from other disco singers'. ""The Closest Thing To Heaven"" and ""Paradise Bird"" were lush, layered ballads with beautiful melodies. ""Bring It On Back To Me"" was a pop torch song. ""Jealousy"" and ""Step Into The Love Line"" anticipated the direction dance music would take in the 80's when the ""Disco Sucks"" backlash drove producers into the New Wave."
2,"Disco Neavaux,,,,,,","This was an OK compilation,,,,I do enjoy the remix of Knock On Wood,,,not bad for an old song."
2,Where are the extras?,"If you are a fan of Full Moon movies, or of the Night of the Demons series then this should be right up your alley. But if you have the choice between video and DVD, pick up the video instead. The packaging for this states that the extras include 40 Full Moon trailers, 2 theatrical trailers (funny since this movie was direct to video), Cast info, and a Featurette: The Making of Witchouse. What you REALLY get is 6 trailers, 34 less than advertised, lame cast bios and no Featurette. Someone over at Full Moon made a pretty big mistake and noone else there caught it. I think anyone interested in this should be aware of what you are really getting, ripped off! For the price, the DVD with the extras it has is pretty good, but since it advertises more than it delivers, the rating suffers. You're better off with the video, you'll get a few trailers, and the featurette appears after the film. You won't be missing anything."
2,Not worth your time,"B and low budget horror is typically my favorite genre. A movie can be a great movie despite its budget; any movie, regardless of budget, must achieve certain qualities to be a good movie. Good acting, good camera work, etc, all must be there, and are certainly attainable with low budget equipment. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't achieve any of those elements. I will say this is by no means the worst horror film I've seen, as it offers some redeeming qualities. It just doesn't present anything compelling; the acting is mostly very weak, and the story development is way too slow. None of this is especially annoyingly bad, but it isn't enough to overcome the terrible special effects. The ""horror"" parts are simply awful. There's a scene of a witch stabbing people who have to be standing 20' away. Again, not the worst I've seen, but definitely in the bottom 20% of my viewing experiences."
3,GOOD AND ENTERTAINING; NOTHING MORE,"Unlike the two sequels, this first installment was actually not a waste of time. It had the correct mix of everything-sex, violence, mystery and not to many victims. There is such a thing as overkilling, even in sensless slasher flicks. This could have been the launching pad for some decent sequels. Such was not the case. The story behind the story was told just right. Parts of this movie were corny, but any slasher fan will be satisfied. I was , but not much more."
4,Decent enough movie for fans of the genre...,"I typically love Full Moon releases, so maybe I'm a bit biased. This movie was very reminiscent of ""Night of the Demons"" in certain places, so if you're a fan of that movie, you'll probably like this one too. One thing - the DVD release is listed as having 40 trailers... I only saw about 6 listed in the menu when I watched this movie. Did I miss something or was I taken?"
4,Still something to check out!,"Anyways, I still feel for a b movie, this was a good find. Itwas violent when it needed to be, and serious and funny when need be.The special effects were ID4 worthy, but I hated that movie anyways. Unfortunatley, one of the actors died after this film was compeleted. He can also be seen in The Killer EYE: Terror Vision. as one of the guys running around in Boxer briefs. This movie has very strong point. The cast isn't bad, the makeup is good, and the witch looked great in costume. I am planning on making this the first DVD I purchase."
3,Large Medi Chest,"This is extremely large, and the next size down is too small. It also seems to open ""backwards"" which makes it a little awkward. The covers on the individual compartments seem to be flimsy and they open too easily. I've had to put my chest into a gallon freezer bag so I don't spill my pills all over when I put the chest in my carry-on when traveling. I'm afraid they won't withstand much opening and closings.I do like the fact that I can remove each days row individually.I'm slightly disappointed in this item, but am in need of something that is large enough to handle the size of the pills I take.[ASIN:B000EGN1AG Apex Medi Chest Large]]"
2,"very cheap, not durable","I like the size and look of this pill holder, but it broke the second week as one of the tabs fell off. I should have read reviews before buying this. I'll try the other brand now."
2,difficult opening each cap,difficult to open each and every day compartment to fill or retreive medicationI would not recommend these especially for elderly
2,Doors open from the left.,"I own the smaller version of these and was surprised that this one has doors that open from the left.. Being right handed, it makes this more difficult to load.. If your a lefty, you might like these better.."
2,Given as a post hospital gift,My mother and father found it to difficult to use. In their eighties I thought it would keep all of mom's medications lined up but tey were unhappy and went back to doling out their pills from each bottle when they needed to be taken.
5,Great For Big Fingers and Lots of Meds,"If you're taking a lot of pills like me, then these large Amex Medi Chest pill containers are the way to go. The compartments are large and easy to work with. And I love that each day's worth of pills can be removed so you only have just the 1 day's compartment to deal with, instead of having to handle the entire week's container all at once. Everything is clearly marked in nice bold black ink and is easy to read, even without glasses. I bought 5 of these and prep a whole month in advance at a time. The price was right, so I'd rather do that tedious chore monthly instead of weekly. They appear to be durable too, so I expect them to last me a good while. Would definitely buy again. Good Luck!!"
4,okay,"product was good quality and worked great. However, I found it more of a pain in general to use so i quit using it within a week"
3,Needs better materials,"If this Pill box was made of better materials, it would be the ideal pillbox. It has large compartments, each day lifts out of the box, it is clear, so you can tell at a glance if you took your meds or not and you have four compartments for each day. It has every thing we need, except with in a month, two of the little doors that keep your meds in its compartment had broken off."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap! Doesn't deserve a star","I bought two of these in late April based on the five-star review. They hold a ton of meds, BUT, the covers to the individual compartments break EASILY. Within the first week of use, a cover on both mine and my daughter's broke as we were lifting the individual trays out. We are currently using one medi-chest as a replacement for the other as the covers continue to break--no matter how carefully we handle them. At this rate, we are hoping one of them can be used for a few months while we search for a better case for our meds!!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I take a lot of medication and the compartments were not big enough to hold all my pills so I had to use the dinner and bedtime slots for all my evening pills. Also within 8 weeks, the Thursday morning compartment door broke off and so I was no longer able to use that compartment. Wish it had been a little more durable."
3,Medication Chest,"Be careful putting any tape (scotch, etc) on the compartments. I did some reminders and found the lettering on the plastic comes right off. Also, each compartment opens just the opposite of all others I have used. Not a deal killer, but annoying. However, the price was right."
1,Poor Quality,"Poor quality, will not last. Opened pkg, very large, lots of room BUT....one of the lift out sections had problems with the lids, very difficult to open each section, also one of the ""hinges"" on one compartment was severed 3/4 of the hinge. It is now holding together by a tiny bit of plastic. I had already loaded all but the last section with pills. If you choose to buy this check everything first, open and close the lids and inspect carefully and be prepared to return this.I had a smaller one I have used for years, finally one of the latches broke and I thought it was time to upgrade. Don't waste your money!"
2,medicine holder,This pill holder is flimsy and is hard to open. I would not recommend it to anyone. Neither would I purchase another one.
1,Poorly Made,One of the compartment doors snapped off after just a few days of use. I will not buy this brand again.
2,"Nice handle, ineffective tool","Like with most OXO kitchen implements, this ""Dough Blender"" has a sturdy, easy-to-grip handle. The blending end, unfortunately, is not so sturdy. The wires are about the thickness of whisk wires, and they tend to clump or spread apart when confronted with hard bits of butter. I have used mine several times, and while it does eventually get the job done, it's only slightly more efficient than butter knives. The wires on my tool are permanently mis-spaced from normal use--there is a large gap between the middle loops. It is easy to clean, and I imagine if you're working with softer materials, like shortening, this tool might work for you. On hard butter, though, it's frustratingly ineffective.I am not pleased with this product and strongly encourage you to buy something sturdier. I'm eventually going to upgrade to something with blades--I think the increase in sturdiness will outweigh the inconvenience of cleaning it."
5,Can''t go wrong with this one!,Excellent product! I use this several times a week when making biscuits. Great for any pastry dough that needs butter/lard/shortening mixed with flour. Very easy to clean and the handle makes it easy to grab and use.
2,Wires Spread,"I have had this blender for a while. It is okay on smaller jobs such as streusel but I recently made a double pie crust recipe and instead of cutting the butter the wires spread and let the butter pass through almost whole. It was a mess. By the time I was done by arms were sore, the blender was misshapen and there were still huge chunks of butter in the dough. I would suggest getting one that has sides to it so the wires don't have as much room to spread."
2,Falls apart too easily,"It works like its suppose to for a while, be the ""tongs"" are too fragile and bendable. I make a lot of pies during the holiday season, and one tong broke off and another couple were bent beyond repair. Do yourself a favor and purchase a more substantial piece of equipment. I was very displeased at this product."
2,Don't bother buying it!,"this dough blender is pretty useless. the wires are not reinforced which makes cutting cold butter into the flour almost impossible and very time-consuming. you're better off just using two knives or your fingers than this dough blender, that's for sure. what a disappointment!"
5,Best pastry blender on the market,"I have used one of these for 15 years. The grip is far more comfortable than the ones with metal handles, and the rounded wires do not cut or bother your fingers when you wipe off the excess shortening or butter (like others with flat metal cutting edges do). It works better than others I've had, it's easier to wash (because of the rounded wires) and it appears to be indestructible. When my daughter went off to college, she asked me to send her one so she could make pies and crumbles. I gave her mine, thinking it would be easy to replace it. I couldn't find it in any local stores (and many inferior versions were actually more expensive), so I ordered it here."
1,too wimpy,"Lately I've been replacing a few kitchen gadgets that just don't work right, and this is one of them. The wire cutters are too weak, they bend out of the way instead of blending ingredients. I don't know if all wire-style dough blenders have this problem but I think I'm going to try a bladed type."
1,dont buy this...get the one with blades!,"I have used inexpensive pastry blenders for years, but the handles broke or the blades came loose. So was very excited when I saw this OXO model. Was VERY disappointed with it. As other reviews point out, the wires do not cut--they bend. They are not rigid enough to cut shortening into dough. The handle is great, the wires are useless. The 'OXO Good Grips Dough Blender with Blades'[model number: 1124200] looks like a better tool, although I have not tried it yet. I just went out and bought another 'cheapie' with BLADES."
3,Works okay for a while,"We have had one of these for a couple of years and are now replacing it... the bits of plastic that surround the wires are now cracking and threatening to show up in the crust! It's not a bad example of the species... we probably got it as the best that a grocery store had to offer, but will replace it with better."
1,Why I'm Here,"I'm here on Amazon looking at pastry blenders to replace this guy which finally broke yesterday. The handle broke at one of the end wires, so I had to pull it up out of the way so I could finish my pie crust. Granted, I had it for years, but I'm looking for my tools to last a lifetime- I guess I'm funny that way.I also agree with the other commenter that the hard butter just pushes the wires out of the way. This really isn't a very well-designed piece of equipment and I should have noticed it when I bought it, but I was pretty enamored of OXO Good Grips tools. I can't imagine someone with limited abilities being able to use this thing though."
3,"Its ok, could be better. . .","For the price, its a decent value.Sturdy enough for light-medium bakers.If you bake alot, dont get a wire version.The butter does get clogged in the wire andyou have to keep clearing it til the doughgets a little worked. Its still easierthan using 2 forks!"
2,Cracked plastic,"I liked the product because the handle was more comfortable to hold than my previous one. Cold butter was hard to cut with this, and the last time I used it, one of the end tines was bending way out. After closer inspection, I saw that the plastic around the tine had just cracked apart. Some duct tape might do the trick, but no, I'm now searching for a better pastry blender."
5,Great! Even for my arthritic hands/wrists,"Easy to use....even for my arthritic hands. Even my 7 year old could cut in the butter like a pro! Easy to clean. The wires did separate a bit, but it doesn't affect its ability to cut through the butter/dough with ease."
1,"wires too flexible, they just clump together","Usually OXO products are fairly tough and durable, but not this one. It is impossible to cut cold butter and flower with this blender because the wires just clump all together. You would have better luck with a fork and that isn't saying much.I haven't found a replacement product, but I have seen ones that have solid metal stripes rather than wires."
2,Torture for the most part 1&1/2 stars!! Bad Santa Much better!,"Billy Bob what happened? He plays a similar character as he did in BAD SANTA (A HILARIOUS MOVIE) a perverted drunk washup. He wasn't bad, but when the rest of the cast is uninspiring over actors it gets ridiculously unbelievable, not entertaining and boring!! Whoever is in charge of casting the kids in this movie are terrible scouts for young talent. What were these kid- actors relatives to the producers? Yeah I know they are just kids, but this was really bad....I mean REALLY BAD!! Don't waste your time!!"
2,BLAHHHH,"movie was ok ...a few funny words from billy bob thornton and some potty mouthed kids....but ultimately this is the same movie as will ferrell's ""KICKING AND SCREAMING"" which was alot funnier.....so just decide who u wanna see...ferrell or thornton..and go see it"
1,zero stars,"There was nothing on so I decided to watch this piece of crap movie. No wonder kids nowadays are so stupid and bratty, their parents let them watch and act like the ones on this movie...and celebrating at a certain 'adult'/desperate mens restaurant with kids? Come on! I cant believe how many people thought this movie was good, or even OK. Its garbage and shows how low society is falling."
1,Snore...,I could have hibernated through this movie. You would think any movie with Billy Bob Thornton would at least be fun to watch just because he is in it playing the liquored up loser Coach Morris Buttermaker. I was disappointed. It was a listless movie with everyone just going though the moves. Or it sure felt that way to me. And I couldn't root for any of those kids. None of them had a little spark of charisma.Avoid this remake and see the original with Walter Matthau. This version struck out with me.
3,It was ok.,"Kind of disappointed. I mean there were a lot of silly one liners, and some parts I just laughed too hard. BUT Marcia Gay Harden really did nothing, you never understood her charatures, and she really was just a waste. Greg Kinnear, played the other team leader who said that winning isn't everything, but obviously he didn't go along with what he preached. There were a lot of great moments with nasty one-liners, and fun at the kids expense from Billy Bob. It was ok, I think that that wasn't as good as the original, but it was ok. The kids in the movie were well cast and did a nice job of recreating the original roles. Here once again, this movie has the feel of a homage. The only innovation was to make the ethnic mix of the team more diverse. I am not sure that I would buy it unless I was a BILLY BOB fan, or loved baseball. I would said it would be a good afternoon movie when there isn't a lot on."
4,"Good Movie, Especially for a Remake","I was very skeptical about this movie when I first heard about it. Why remake a classic? I was pleasantly surprised. There are some very good one-liners in the movie, and there are enough differences to make it stand on its own. Billy Bob Thornton is fantastic as always. Not a movie for kids, but good nonetheless."
2,Only good if you haven't seen the original.,"I'll be short. The original was the best. The coach was a slacker and was throughout the movie. In this one Billy Bob seems to try to mimic Walter Matthau and the rest as well. The original was racy and risky. This one at the final game all of a sudden both coaches are mean? It just didn't work. None of it worked. I like Billy Bob and I was able to finish the movie. But come on. When Joeys mother was like ""I'm taking Joey home right now"", was a joke. It just didn't work."
3,It was all right,"At first I was turned off by the crude humor in the movie, but in the end it was an ok movie. Some of the jokes are hit and miss, as is the acting. It's hard to know what to expect with this kind of movie, but the idealistic ending was cute enough to forget all the bad parts."
3,Dirtier than I thought it would be!,"I'm not going to lie to you..this film is vulger!!! It surprised me greatly. I know that it was PG-13 and was written by the guys who wrote Bad Santa, but I've never seen kids curse so much!!Sometimes the vulgar terms were funny with the kids, but sometimes it felt like, ""Okay, okay. Stop with the swearing!"" lol.This movie was almost 100% true to the terrific orginal with Walter Matthau. I don't know whether that's a good thing or not. It depends on personal opinions. Billy Bob acted exactly like Matthau. Many of the scenes were exactly the same. I found myself saying, ""Ah! I knew that would happen next!"" It was kind of interesting to see certain parts modernized from the orginal and some of the characters were a bit different.But, all in all, it was an amusing, vulger comedy that kids should HIGHLY avoid. Teens and above may enjoy the mean jokes and curses used."
4,Nice Funny Movie,This movie kind of suprised me. It turned out to be funnier than I expected. Billy Bob fit his role well and played it well to.
3,DID WE NEED THIS REMAKE?,"Why anyone thought we needed a remake of a movie that spawned two sequels is beyond me. This version is merely a rehashing of the superior original Walter Matthau vehicle and since we already know what to expect, not nearly as fun. Director Richard Linklater (School of Rock) doesn't offer us any significant changes and even Billy Bob Thornton walks through his role as Buttermaker. Sammi Kraft has the pitches as Amanda, but not the spunk Tatum O'Neal had. The rest of the kids do okay, but are potty mouthed kids really funny anymore? And the climactic game offers no suspense since we know the outcome. Greg Kinnear does all he can as the superjock rival coach but why is talented Marcia Gay Harden wasted in her role as the mom? Beats me, but then the necessity for this whole movie seems superfluous."
3,Billy Bob Baseball,"Bad News Bears is a baseball film which crosses several moral and social boundaries. It is however the lack of cleanliness that makes this movie entertaining. Billy Bob Thornton plays a washed up former professional baseball player turned youth coach, and he delivers some good scenes with his prickly temper and wandering eyes. The children in this film have varying baseball skills and self-confidence, and this combines for a dysfunctional team dynamic. A funny baseball picture if you don't mind a bit of toilet humor.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
2,Bad News Bears: Not For Everyone,"This movie was comprised of a stream of dragging scenes of young boys fighting, cursing, and showcasing their unbelievably horrible baseball skills. Nothing deep, nothing profound. Just rowdy kids playing ball.However, there were some sharp one-liners and jokes that made me laugh out loud. Billy Bob does a good job of playing a disillusioned, crass old lech trying to redeem his middle years by assuming the role of a little league baseball coach.If you liked ""A League of Their Own,"" you probably won't like this one because this movie is as far away from a chick flick as Liberaci is from being straight."
3,It's fun and Billy Bob dose a great job,The movie was a fun film just to watch billy Bob act like a drunk and swear and get drunk some more. The movie is rated PG-13 and I think the movie would of been better if it was R and the movie is abssically an R movie. the story is good but drags on at times which might make the viewer board. But Billy Bob Thorton dose a great job and saves the movie it's fun just to watch him act.
1,Bad news for the Bears,"As a person who grew up watching the original Bears, I was quite disappointed in the new version of the classic. Not only do I find the movie offensive and unfitting for kids of any age, I was extremely turned off by the constant use of vulgar language and sexual suggestions through out the movie. Its no wonder the kids of today have such problems watching and listening to the over use of swearing in movies now a days. What happened to family movies where the whole family could sit down and enjoy them? I don't see where there was the need to have the kids swearing at the coach in pretty much every scene. And the scene with the kid sitting on the bench where the only words readable were ""got laid"", with him blocking the word ""off"" is necessary. If you want a good movie, don't get this version."
2,THIS PROVES HOW UNNECESSARY REMAKES ARE....,"It was nice to reminisce of the good ol' days, when movie making was an actual art. This movie shows a perfect example of how remakes of classics are totally unnecessary, unless they can show off newer animation and technology (e.g. king kong, war of the worlds, etc.). Billy Bob is funny, but thats all this movie offers. Was this movie a remake or a spoof ? The kids acting was horrible, and they are far less cute than the original cast. The bad mouthing and swearing of the kids was not funny, but more annoying than anything. Tatum O'neal was adorable as Amanda, but this new girl looks as if she is being forced into acting and looks like a guy with long hair. Hollywood, should ban all remakes !"
2,ok,"very cheap and not done well at all..I wish I had not ordered these, I went to a train show and bought better for cheaper"
4,Worth the price!,This game is the best! The only hard part about it is the cars but once you get used to it you'll get it.
5,awsome,this game is so awsome for people that love marykate and ashley and love to play games thats my review
2,Not as much fun as it says.,"Mary-Kate and Ashley's game is only half of what it said it is. There is no Rock climbing, surfing or fasion. All you do is simple missions with cars pulling out in front of you and giving you tickets. This is not one of the best M-K&A games they put out. The other MK&A games are alot better."
4,I love it!!!,This game is so much fun you'd want to play it all day. .... I like the delivery game the most. My friend even likes the game. I think that children everywhere would like this game.
3,A Smokin Review,"[...]It's smooth musical beats and spine-tingling lyrics mesh well to make this a complete cd. Ranging from smooth tracks like 20's and Mr. President to a more gangstafied drug anthem like Cocaine. So in closin if i had to describe this cd to another person using only one word, it would have to be versatile."
1,Country Row? Not the Skid Row I was looking for.,"So I've been on both sides of the fence with this Skid Row battle. I've seen some bands carry on pretty good with new singers and I figured hey we'd get the usual two sides with both having good results. Well Mr. Bach is still metal and hard rock just the way I like it and this.........UM Skid Row? Is it really. Starts out with something similar that has a Bach era feel to it then BAM!!!! Country music?, Country music REALLY!!!!!!!! Did I miss something here? I wouldn't even of minded if you went back to more of your sound from the first skid days or if you have to toy with a country feel then it better be sounding more like Dime and Vinnies project not this crap. I'm disappointed with Skid Row, it's not Skid Row anymore and it sounds like they don't know if they want to be Skid Row any more. Very disappointed. Another legendary band bites the dust."
2,Not great,"Very disappointed in this cd after really enjoying Thickskin. The new singer's voice is amazing but the songs are just badly put together.Ok songs include Disease, Pulling My Heart Out From Under Me and Strength.Everything else is par or well below."
1,THIS SUCKS...........,Ok we all know Bolan is Skid Row but lets be honest except for Van Halen replacing roth for Hagar we all know Bach belongs back with Skid Row. Come on guys get back together and tour already. Look if Motley Crue can get back together and tour even though they travel in seperate tour buses so they don't fight then so be it! I wouldn't mind if they got back their original singer Matt Fallon. I hear the guy is still available.........
1,Give me more hands to cover my ears,"Whenever you run out of toilet paper to wipe. Go and get this CD, it's just as good."
4,Nice!,"OK,,,so Thickskin was great! RPM is really really good,,,,,but cant quite compare to its predecessor. This album rocks and actually has a few goofy sort of fun tunes on it. I put this on and havent taken it out in a few days. My GF loves it and I was actually asked by a driver on a motorcyle who it was when they stopped next to me at a traffic light. The song You Lie is a classic fun song, very catchy! Keep rocking guys!"
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Leeson is certainly a master at his craft of writing. But you need to like his style if you're to enjoy this book. You might love it, I just didn't. It's a bit choppy in it's delivery, a bit too many metaphors for my tastes, too many adjectives that seem to me to be just a bit too much. Read Middleton, or read some Steve Raymond, then read this, and if you like Leeson's style better that's great and more power to you. When I look for fishing books I want the author to just tell me what the heck they like and why without making it complicated, convoluted and metaphorical. You can get ""deep"" if you like, but too much of that and the motivation for writing the book is in question. ""Deep"" isn't a writing style, it's a feeling from the heart. I just don't think it comes through as much as other folks say it does. It is NOT a bad book, but if there are folks looking for Thoreau, this isn't Thoreau."
5,Read it.,"Mr. Leeson's book is about flyfishing, but it is not your typical flyfishing book. It is much more well-written and insightful than anything else written on the subject. Read it; you will not be disppointed."
5,The living king of fishing writing,Ted is the best writer on fishing living today and the incredibly well rounded book is a delight to read. The book is not a sports commentary giving play by play on fish caught but rather an investigation of why we are captivated by our pursuit. those who dam this book would be better off reading a fishing report from a trawler.
2,didn't realize I needed the LeapPad for this,"Being new to this toy, I didn't realize that I ordered only the software. I ordered 2 types of My First LeapPad Software but no LeapPad to play it on. I live in the caribbean, so I couldn't just go into a store and buy it. Whatever I ordered and didn't order that time was it, for the next 6 months---until my next visit to the continent. Amazon should advertise for those who don't know while ordering for grandchildren or other children, or even into a new age group like myself, that you need the LeapPad for this. Needless to say, it stayed in its package for a very long time without use."
5,Had it for a year and still going strong,"This was purchased for my daughter last year when she was three for christmas, it is now a year later and she still loves it. I love the leap pad systems and my first leap was great and now i think she will be going into the regular leap pad and like my others will enjoy hours of fun. You will not go wrong with dora!!"
4,Review of Dora Leappad,The product was delivered in a timely manner which we appreciate. It was a present for a four year old granddaughter and she loves it.
4,very good learning product,this leap pad book is excellent my 3 year old loved it i think she learnt a lot with this one
2,A Sheep In Wolf's Clothing....,"Supposedly abrasive and avant-garde, this train wreck of an LP has very little in the way of actual musical value. I gave it 2 stars for the spoken word oddity ""The Gift"" because I'm a poetry lover and John Cale's reading manages to sustain a modicum of interest over 8 minutes, otherwise, this is a case of a lot of stinky smoke, but no fire."
2,One that doesn't rise above ground,2 1/2The extra-raw production does not compliment underwritten songs here -a downgraded formula which had seemingly eluded the band before and after- though here really shows a rough internal process at its coarsest and least inspired.
1,Good Grief!,"If you can sit through 17 1/2 minutes of ""Sister Ray"" ""suckin' on that ding-dong"" , then go right ahead.There are a lot better records out there even if you are into the ""avante garde."""
2,Just don't get it,"While I love all 3 other VU album, I simply don't get this one. After about 20 sometimes really painful listening, I give up.This album has its moments with me with the title track, here she comes now and I heard her call my name. But the gift, what the hell? A narration of a story about somebody mailing himself and ultimately getting killed with background music from the band.This isn't outright terrible like Playing With Fire or something, but man, this is not enjoyable.White Light/White Heat 4/5The Gift 1/5Lady Godiva's Operation 3/5Here She Comes Now 5/5I Heard Her Call My Name 4/5Sister Ray 3/5(can be 4/5, but too long)"
3,"some excellent, some disgusting, some bad","i have mixed feelings about this one. I pretty much like all of it, except john cale's songs. im sorry, i may hate it because of its gruesomness, and they may be great songs, but i really dont like them. The gift is kindof funny, and pretty disturbing too, but i cant take Lady Godiva's Operation. It evokes bad stuff, and i really hate hospitals, especially operations. And john cale's voice is way too unnerving, so maybe it was a success. But i really dig lou reed's songs, especially the title track. whatever, im going in circles."
5,If you like this you can [upset] people... with it!!,This was the first Velvets album i got. After hearing droning things like Spacemen 3 Pink Floyd. I liked it from the beginning. I like the rythems especially on Sister Ray which could have been the only song on it. There are so many little noises you can hear after listening to it many times. Lou Reed's harsh spitting lyrics are great too. Whenever someone in an apartment near me is playing annoyingly loud top 40 pop. I love to put this on. I can see why alot of people would think it is noise especially if theyve never heard anything but classic rock or pop music. I dont really listen to it all the time just for special occasions.
1,Overrated garbage,"Spoken words, horrible singing, and the... overhyped Sister Ray. I very much like some VU, Sonic Youth, Nirvana, The Pixies and other bands not considered mainstream. But this is not music. It is a joke, however. Anyone with the least degree of objectivity can't think this is good. It is painful to sit through. Put on a good Beatles, Stones, or Miles Davis album, then listen to this noise. It doesn't hold up. There's no talent in the grooves. I guess this is supposed to be some sort of avant-garde or alternative experiment. If so, then it is nothing more than a guise for people without talent doing something different that is labeled as cool or groundbreaking, but in reality smacks of incompetence."
1,"The ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of Albums","I have to admit that when I first heard this album as a high-school student, I was captivated by how horrible it was. My friends and I would listen to it repeatedly, almost to the point of cult-worship. We then sought out other Velvet Underground albums, hoping for a similar ""so bad it's good"" experience - but alas, none of the band's other releases, bereft of musicianship or good lyrics though they were, could compare with ""White Light White Heat."" Everything just came together magnificently on this one - the writing, the playing, the singing, the engineering, even the famous ""skull cover""... It all adds up to a classic!I don't want to spoil the music by analyzing it too much, but let me point out Sterling Morrison's lead guitar on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" as a ""highlight"" of this special collection."
1,Noisy heroin induced junk,"I mean honestly, this album sucks. I know its supposedly the prototype for punk, but c'mon there are much better examples of proto punk, i.e. The Stooges. There is just too much heroin on this record. ""Sister Ray"" is a noisy mess. The only worthwhile track is the title track. The rest of the album is just an all out attack on quality music. Don't get me wrong, I love rawness and imperfection in my rock music, but this is just crap. There are better representations of what the Velvet Underground were capable of and how influential they were for punk and indie music. Pick up the slightly overrated ""Velvet Underground and Nico"" and also the very underrated ""Velvet Underground."" But skip this one all together. You'll be better for it. nuff said"
5,Chaotic guitar orgies with a...heart?,"Well, needless to say, this album rocks, and yet I chose to submit a review primarily to say that while I dig the enthusiasm of the reviewer just before me, I think they should have pointed out the brilliance of Velvet Underground and Nico, the band's classic debut. I would have to say that ""it"" all began with THAT recording, not this one, though any worthwhile person should go out and buy all 4 major recordings anyway...now!"
4,A beautiful mess,"Its supporters call it an avant-garde masterpiece, its detractors call it horribly unlistenable, and the truth is probably somewhere in between. White Light/White Heat, more than any other of its time, points ahead to the punk movement in New York that was just around the bend. But this album is more crafted than a Ramones album, there are more ideas amidst the ferocity than most punk albums that would emerge in the 70s.This album stands out even more when compared to the music that was popular at the time. A far cry from the hippie movement that was so predominant at the time, this album certainly stands out as the ugly duckling of the 60s. But perhaps it are these differences that make the album still sound so fresh 35 years down the line.If you like your music raw, with ragged edges and everything hanging out, you will probably appreciate the intensity of this album."
4,Feedback fury,"The late rock critic Lester Bangs once wrote that in the summer of '68 he locked himself in his room and listened to two albums: Van Morrison's Astral Weeks and White Light/White Heat (which may explain why he turned out the way he did). This is the type of album that can keep you in a trance for days on end. Nearly every song has that mesmerizing feel about it, the sole exception being ""Here She Comes Now,"" a ballad which gives the listener a needed pause to catch a breath. The title track is one of the group's finest, while ""Lady Godiva's Operation"" and ""The Gift"" engulf the listener in a sea of guitar feedback. By the time you get to ""Sister Ray"" you'll be completely swallowed up. At over 17 minutes, I find it unnecessarily long, which is the only reason I hesitate giving this album a full 5 stars. Otherwise, this is an unblemished work of art. Contemporary MTV alt-rock darlings wish they could make an album this ferocious."
3,Are you kidding me?????,"Keep in mind that this album has the hallmarks of a low grade production. Vocals are muffled, guitars sound thin, there's hardly any bass, the drums are nowhere to be foud in the mix, and is ove-rmodulated as all hell. This album was designed to be listened to on an old cheap record player connected to cheap speakers. If your into collecting MFSL gold discs then this should be a nice addition in the ""What Were They Thinking"" file. Others save your money and just buy the standard aluminum disc."
5,They're All Lying,"""White Light/White Heat"" is one of the most accessible albums I've heard in a while. And it's not a total mess of guitars. Sure it's noisy, but there is more of a fuzziness to it than a hairiness. The reviews that said this album is bad, were lying. The reviews that said this was the best of the VU weren't."
4,first Velvet album for me - quite good,"This is my first exposure to the Velvet Underground. I can see how influential they were. I actually have Volume 3 of the ""Peel Slowly and See"" series, which gives me some insight into their songwriting process. Lyrically, this group is supremely unafraid to deal with ANYTHING. They can do touching pop and chilling stories of murder and isolation with the same amount of style and passion. The standout track for me on ""White Light/White Heat"" is ""I Heard Her Call My Name"", which is utter, unparalleled genius. What was Lou Reed smoking when he recorded the lead guitar part? Was he on acid? It is just unbelievable. The other tracks are great, too, except for ""Sister Ray"", which I absolutely can't stand. Both Side 2 Tracks illustrate this. Tremendously influential."
4,SOME INTERESTING TOPICS,"THIS BOOK ASKS SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS CONCERNING SOME OF THE LEGENDS OF BASEBALL. DID BABE RUTH CALL HIS SHOT, HOW OLD WAS SATCHEL PAIGE, WAS MOE BERG A SPY, AND DOES A CURVE BALL CURVE ARE SOME OF THE SUBJECTS COVERED. BUT MOST OF THE SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN COVERED BEFORE AND ARE NOT REALLY NEW. STILL THE BOOK IS WORTH READING, AND PROVIDES SOME GOOD INSIGHTS. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR THE CASUAL AND THE NEW BASEBALL FANS. FOR THE HISTORIAN OR HARD CORE FANS, MOST THIS IS REDUNDANT AND SAME OLD SAME OLD."
5,another good leap book,"This one has a lot of fun games in a wide range of types.It has lots of the ""guess which animal/person/thing I'm thinking of"" games... which are my daughter's favorite.It also has a lot of pages about letter sounds and rhyming.Good addition to your leap library."
5,Not Fisher Price,"The toy is fun and educational but the cartridges are easily lost and the pen stopped working after 3 months, probably because my kid was rough with it. If your child is tough on toys, this one won't last long."
4,My four-year old daughter enjoyed it...,"...but it wasn't one of her favorites. It more or less introduces kids to a number of nursery rhymes, teaching them some reading, singing and rhyming skills. Nevertheless, with regards to learning these three skills, my daughter much preferred the ""There's a Wocket in My Pocket"" My First LeapPad Book. This latter book is based on the work of Dr. Seuss, who is still the master when it comes to entertaining kids as you educate them about reading and rhyming."
3,Fun - but doesn't hold interest,"I bought this for my 3-yr. old because he had fun playing with his cousins. Apparently, that was just because it was his cousins. He played with it for a few days and that has been it. Even his brothers don't seem too interested. Can't beat reading them a book yourself."
4,Mom and Dad love the book- our son was bored with it!,"We got this book last year with the My first leap pad and a few other books. Our son did'nt take to the Tad or Leap books and we have 4 different ones of Tad and Leap that have went unplayed with since last Christmas. They are really great, they actually have more games, songs and learning activites than any of the other books like Bob the Builder and Thomas the Train.Our son however likes the cartoon figures so Thomas the train, Bob the Builder and Dora are some of the only ones he liked.I still give this book 4 stars- its a good book for the my first leap pad."
4,well done performance,"The audio cassette provides an excellent reading of an amusing novel. Bruce Montague gives a lively performance befitting to the light spirit of the book. Although not great literature, Bates's novel is diverting and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon."
3,Overpriced Unless You Have Arthritis,"The whisk works very well and is easy to clean. It also seems pretty well made, and I expect it to last me a long time. It is everything I expected it would be. However, I do not think this whisk provides a great value. OXO is a pretty good brand, but I don't think it's worth the premium pricing unless you have arthritis, whisk for hours at a time, or have some other need to have very large handles. I bought this out of convenience because I didn't even know how much a non premium whisk would cost at Target. If you are willing to get a different brand with a plain handle, they are about seventy percent less than on Amazon. The large handle also takes up more space in my kitchen drawer."
4,"nice whisk, good quality, big size","I bought this OXO Good Grips whisk in the 11"" size thinking it would be good for many uses. I didn't want to get too dinky of one and this one definitely isn't dinky! Good big size, nice grip (like all the good grips line). I highly recommend."
5,Great product!!!!,Love this whisk!!!!! Made well and does it's job properly. I would gladly recommend this to anyone I know. You can get this at BBB for a bit cheaper with 20% coupon.
5,Very nice,Has a nice feel in the hand and works great. Cleaning is very simple and it seems to take to the dishwasher very well.
5,well-designed whisk for multi applications,"When shopping for a whisk last year I was tempted to get a somewhat cheaper one, until my husband pointed out that this one was particularly well-made, and the ferrule joined seamlessly with the wires -- which meant no food residue trapped inside, easier cleaning and no rusting. Trust me, not all whisks have wires sealed in at the base!Well, he was right. The contoured, easy-grip handle is a bonus. This whisk is so stury, I doubt I will ever have to buy another. It's also a good medium size, versatile for eggs and everything else I've ever needed a whisk for. Perfect!"
5,I Love OXO!,"OXO never disappoints with their products and this is no exception. This whisk works great, it feels comfortable in the hand and has just enough give. I made two batches of caramel sauce with this and after the first batch seized up on me it was not hard to wash the hardened crystals off the rungs. That makes this whisk a winner!"
5,"Nicely built, comfortable to use","This is a very nicely built whisk, especially considering the price. The wires are bonded well to the handle, which is easy to grip and feels sturdy. The whisk performs well and is easy to clean. Nicely sized -- not too big, not too small. While you can spend a lot more for a more elegant or fancy looking tool, this gets the job done just as well, and appears built to last.I have a few other OXO kitchen tools and they have never let me down. This is no exception -- a great value, and highly recommended."
5,typical OXO ergonomics,"I generally love OXO stuff for the ergonomics, and this one doesn't disappoint. I've mostly used it for combining first dry then wet ingredients when baking."
5,Best whisk ever!,"LOVE it..Very comfortable, sturdy, well made and clean design. The wires have just enough flex but they aren't all over the place. I keep it with my OXO batter bowl and together they have to be my favorite kitchen tools. I can't say enough positive things about it, just a perfect tool for the job."
5,"Durable, lightweight, but not flimsy","I love my new whisk. The product fits nicely into my hand. I love the handle, which is more comfortable than the traditional metal handle. The whisk does an excellant job mixing my ingredients, such as eggs or heavy whipping cream. The wires stay in place, not ending up bent like the cheaper brands. The whisk is dishwasher safe. This kitchen tool makes cooking less of a chore for me."
3,Nice voice!,"Nice voice, but why changing the verses of the song ""Ne me quitte pas""??? The song was beautiful before this version, I am a Jacques Brel fan, and have heard different singers singing this great song. I have to say I was disappointed with this one! The French seems forced, and I missed the forgotten verses; however the music was arranged and performed beautifully. ""Sous le Ciel de Paris"" was adequate, ""Des Histoires"" was much better sung, more a la ""Piaf"", The rest of the cd is great to listen to, I liked the deeper voice in the ""Bachianas Brasileiras"". I also like the Portuguese songs, I felt that Karrin Allyson was more ""at home"" with them. In general the music is ""Magnifique""!"
5,Just toooo good!!,"While I was looking for some new music on Amazon, I found this CD and I just HAD to have it. It's just fabulous! I never realized just how good Brazilian and French jazz could be. I totally disagree with [whoever said] Ms. Allyson sounds like she is an American speaking French (in some places) and yet she sounds French in others. Her French is impeccable. Each song is moving and either makes you melancholy and pensive (""Ne me quitte pas"") or makes you want to slink and groove across the room (""O Pato""!) I also loved ""Parisian Thoroughfare"" (strictly scat) and the aria on track 13. This is great stuff folks! It's amazing that we haven't heard from her more. If you're looking for something different to add to your jazz collection or you're just starting out with jazz-you CAN'T go wrong with this."
5,Jazz Music,I love Karrin Allyson. One of the greatest female jazz musician out there. I have most of her cd's. I go see her when she's in town. Great voice....
4,She is the whole package!,"Ms. Allyson's breakout album is a real showcase of all of her many virtues. Her diction is excellent and she shows a real flair for interpretation in every language. I agree with another listener that her Brazilian songs are very special. She is a rare vocalist who can keep her jazz credentials in balance with her ability to convey popular songs. It is too bad that she didn't have the ""A"" Team in post production. While the instruments are well miked, someone made the decision that she needed reverb/echo on each song. It adds nothing to her magnificent voice and calls attention to itself as you try to concentrate on her work. Still worth having in your collection."
4,"Beyond me, but wonderful","I received this as a gift, and I'm simply not equipped to produce any of the six pieces included. I don't have the tools, or the time, and the previous reviewer is correct that - if I *did* have the tools and time - I'd probably want to buy the plans for the projects.That said, if *you* have the tools and time, and particularly if you're crafty and know what you're doing with wood and tools, there are six fantastic projects here that would suit a wide range of ages, something to keep you (and, then, your child) busy through various stages of their development."
3,Sign of missed opportunities,"The highlights of this CD make it a worthwhile purchase. The title tune is the best song on this collection followed closely by Guitar Man and High Heel Sneakers (great bass line). However, there are some filler tunes on this collection as Elvis attempts to put some life into some pedestrian ballads that have not stood the test of time. The overall impression of this CD is ""If only..."". If only his career had been managed better he may have done entire albums of cutting edge folk stuff, Bacharach, blues, country, current rock faves (Mohair Sam), etc. because he had the pipes to deliver when given first rate stuff. In spite of the filler, this is still an essential collection for Elvis fans."
5,Non-soundtrack Recordings circa 1966-68,"This collection contains one of Elvis's strongest periods, the direction he was taking musically, just prior to the TV Comeback Special. These songs are extremely hard to find on other compilations. Sound quality is excellent. 1999 digital remaster."
5,Big Boss Man,"A little bit of country, pop and rock 'n' roll. One of the best compilations of Elvis ever! And I mean it! This is not just a cd for diehard fans or rockabillies. Every rocker must have it! ""Too Much Monkey Business"" is an old Chuck Berry song, ""Guitar Man"" and ""US Male"" are Jerry Reed originals, ""Tomorrow Is A Long Time"" is Bob Dylans country, ""Big Boss Man"" is Willie Dixon's blues, ""Stay Away"" and ""Going Home"" are Wild West songs, ""Love Letters"" is Kelly Lester's, ""Fools Fall In Love"" is another Jerry Leiber/Mike Stoller's song originaly recorded by The Drifters, but his is faster, ""High Heel Sneakers"" is another rock 'n' roll classic, and so on and on... This is really worth having. Rock On!"
4,A Long and Happy Life,A Long and Happy Life was interesting. I chose it because I live near its setting. Character and scene discriptions were excellent. Ending was very sudden and to me unsatisfying.
5,A Long and Happy Life: A Novel,Read a review by Alan Garganus in Oxford American where he talked about the life of Reynolds Price. Could not believe I had not read this novel. Just beautiful.
5,Good glove,I have 4 pairs of different Ektelon glove. This is a very good one. The other most recent one with the Koolmax material and some padding on the back of the glove are not very good for playing. Buy this model.
2,Seam in index finger opened up.,I used this glove for about two weeks and there is a significant amount of wear in the grip of the glove and a seam opened up in the index finger near the knuckle. Additionally its not padded well enough and I've gotten blisters and sores through the glove.
3,Only 3 sessions and the stitching is already faltering,"After reading reviews for different glove options I decided to go with this one and was quite satisfied during my first experience, but right in the middle of the 4th session (I play once a week for about 1.5 hrs.) the stitching in one of the fingers came loose (I can see the tip of my finger).While this hasn't severely affected the purpose of the glove it's quite discouraging that what seemed a well constructed item showed an important defect so quickly.I wonder if the rest of the stitching will also become loose soon.I'm giving it 3 stars because other than such quality flaw it provides a firm grip and materials seem of good quality."
5,Solid Mid-Grade Glove,This is a great mid-range workhorse glove that delivers. As long as you don't let it get soaking wet it will last longer than most on the market and it keeps a decent mid-level tackiness throughout its life.
5,So misunderstood!,"It seems like too many people don't understand the simple fact that this movie is not about the plot! It's not supposed to make sense! The entire movie is one giant nonsensical joke. It's kind of like Andy Kaufman and the fact that everything he did was all a part of an hilarious prank pulled on millions of people. This movie is a joke, and we--the viewers--are the punchline. It is meant to be like that. But then again, I guess if it weren't for people who hate the movie, it wouldn't be funny to people like myself.For anyone who understands John Landis, this is a must-have!"
1,What happened?,"This movie is so bad it hurts to watch it. With the cast, and John Landis directing, I expected at least modest entertainment, but this movie didn't deliver. Not only does the plot make no sense..Adrian Paul as the rich ex-boyfriend hasn't changed his will to cut out Natass after THREE years? but it has all these super irritating scenes that look like they are happening...I am a fan of Adrian Paul, I should have realized when he doesn't get mentioned on the jacket that his part was small..like 45 seconds. My recommendation..watch an old highlander episode and save your $."
3,wasnt that bad of a movie,"Nastassja Kinski(Cold Heart, Cat People) hires Billy Zane(Zoolander, Tombstone), Dan Aykroyd(tv's Psi Factor, Ghostbusters 1 and 2), Lara Flynn Boyle(tv's The Practice, Afterglow), Michael Biehn(The Rock, The Art Of War) and Rob Schneider(Hot Chick, The Animal) into a plan that would kill her ex-husband Adrian Paul(Highlander Endgame, Christine)...Biehn and Schneider shoot Paul three times but he doesnt die....this is a good black comedy with some funny ass moments...a lot of dreaming and waking up though...Zane is hilarious...Kinski is hot and Biehn as Dave is just a plain dumbass...mainly Biehn in his movies plays a cop or a seal or a badguy. other actors are Joey Travolta, Lisa Eichhorn, Bill Duke(Predator, Commando) and Thomas Haden Church(Demon Knight, George of the jungle)."
4,"Revolting, Goofy, stupid, rediculous. I LOVED IT!","With a cast like this, you can only expect a flop. Yet these reviewers who dumped on this flick musta watched something else, 'cause this movie, although not innovative, was an enjoyable romp into the outer-limits of these talented actors' range. If you didn't like this movie, then go watch the Talented Mr. Ripley, then come back. Compared to that movie, you can enjoy anything..."
5,Watch it...AGAIN !,"This movie is worth seeing again. If you see the movie, you will WANT to see it again.The subtle nuances of the film and character interplay are excellent! Fernando's sardonic wit is wonderful.The camera work is amazing, and the pasodobles are great.It is too bad that this movie's subject matter has hindered it from more acclaim. Another example of the many great films that didn't come out of the plastic Hollyweird movie machine.Great characters, great director, great movie...see it, AGAIN!"
3,Great Movie.....Not so great DVD!,I saw the movie on the big screen and thought it was amazing! I purchased the DVD and it looks horrible. First of all it doesn't have a letterbox version. Watching the movie on my TV felt like I was watching a home video and it just didn't have the same effect.
2,"Unexpected, unending, unsettling, unpleasant","I expected a deep story that would bring insight to understanding the termols that define the culture and philosphy of a thrid world country. What I found was a common story dealing with the ordinary lives of gay men overpowering the wills of younger, and very poor, gay boys.I can accept a story of a gay lifestyle. It is common enough. But there was no effort to give the characters depth beyond identifying the adult as wealthy and the boys as poor and desperate to please. The senseless killing that highlighted these young men's behavior brought no meaning to the story, expect to realize that death leads to death. And life goes on. I do not think that what was told in this film was any different than what might be told in New York, Paris or London. Filming the story in Medellin, Colombia may have given it cult status, but it failed to give it any meaning."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"I was forced to give it a star but it does not deserve any. It is slow and boring, the only time you stop yawning is to turn into disgust. It is a waste of time and a shame for the good Colombian movie makers."
4,Good Actors Make Up For A Crazy Story,"This movie is unreal, being a guy I think of why would all of these young boys go and sleep with a guy like ""Fernando"" German Jaramillo? To get his money, quality time together? Come on. Anderson Ballesteros ""Alexis"" and Juan David Restrepo ""Wilmar"" are a bunch of young hot guys. Go get a girl, or younger guy. Nothing against the actor playing Fernando, he shold be with someone his own age. What is it with all these movies and the young guy falling for the older man? This movie is tragic and filmed like a home movie. I only liked it because I got to see Anderson and Juan."
2,Very Disturbing.,"Althrough beautifully filmed and the soundtrack is mesmerizing, it is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. It's decadent, sad, and simply immoral. The film showed some of the darkest sides of humanity. Me and my friend are pretty open minded but we were very disturbed by the non-stop pointless shootings throughout the film as well as the decadent and perverse relationships. I wanted to leave in the middle of the film so bad but waited for a more comforting ending which never came. Months later, images of the story still gives me the creeps. If you have a heart and morals, this film won't fail to upset you."
4,Amazing!!!,"Shocking, enlightening, transformative and unforgettable, this film will burn itself deep into your psyche. One thing I found particularly interesting is that the film's subtext of pedophilia, a very loaded subject in the USA, is inconsequential and not the least bit upsetting - its the abhorrent and omnipresent violence of Columbia that makes this story so powerful. A real education!!!"
2,DVD looks videoy... Not theatrical version,"While the film itself is excellent, the DVD (and VHS version I presumed) version is not the same version in its theatrical release. They simply encoded the original digital video version and the ""film"" truly looks like a video on DVD/VHS. They should have telecined the film-transfer/35mm version which has the depth, color and grain of film. It's much better to watch the print in a theater..."
4,An insightful look into Columbian society,"This film earns its reputation as controversial. The homosexual relationship between the two main protagonists will definitely raise many eyebrows in Western audiences. Actually, the shocking element is not the intergenerational love story, but rather how death and murder happens so frequently within this particular Columbian society. The movie offers little answers, or even the slightest hint of hope. Expect to feel emotionally winded by the conclusion."
2,"When all the critics love it, beware!","This film is a big disappointment, in spite of a gifted director and an important and compelling subject. It is virtually plotless, clumsily put together and I'm sorry to say just plain tedious-something it should never have been. The acting is nothing to write home about, mainly because the script is so feeble. The characters are poorly drawn and basically unlikeable.I could hardly believe this was the same film the critics had been praising so effusively. I found it hard to sit through, in fact, I nearly walked out, but instead hung on till the better end hoping for a glimpse of the masterpiece the critics had discerned.At the end, I remained distinctly underwhelmed."
4,very good compressor,"Michelles husband John using her account)I`ve had this compressor for about a year now. Sometimes we use it on the jobsite, sometimes we use the comprable DeWalt that the guy I work with has- depends on who gets there first. The only complaints I`ve had with it is that its heavy and the cord wrap stinks! Lugging it into houses is a pain and since I primarily do finish work, most of the time it needs to come into the house to be close to the power source. (manual recomends not using extension cords whenever possible) I`ve run every kind of nail gun imaginable on it, frequently more than one at a time, sometimes three or four at a time with a splitter and had no problems. I definitly find it to be better than its DeWalt counterpart and the older twin stack Emglow a guy who used to work with us had. I`ve also had no problem with it starting up in below freezing weather while others I`ve seen need to warm up for a little while. I would definitly buy this compressor again.John"
3,Porter-Cable C3151,"Ordered as a compact, easily portable unit, which it is.Arrived not being able to achieve the stated 150psi.I asked tech support if this could just need to have the regulator adjusted - they said no; take it to a repair center.Left at repair center; after repair, informed they 'adjusted the regulator...' Still doesn't achieve 150psi, but I'll work that out myself.Also doesn't appear to put out the volume of air advertised."
3,ok compressor,I've had this compressor for about 3 years and while it is a good compressor I find it to be very loud compared to others in the same class. Also it vibrates so much that we are constantly retightening the bolts for the wheels and handle assembly. Also the plastic guides for the retractable handle have broken and it makes collapsing the handle difficult. Finally Porter cable needs a better system for the cord. It always unwraps no matter how you wrap it around the cleats.
2,Noisy,This Compressor is to noisy and it rattle too much.Needs to improve their designed on how they attached the wheels .
2,"Not quite enough for air tools, compressor runs constantly","Based on the specifications I assumed that this unit would be sufficient to run my air tools but the compressor indicates that it doesn't have 100% duty cycle so I can not work continuously but have to stop after a minute, let the compressor build up pressure and then wait a couple of minutes for it to rest so I can do another minute of work. Since this is oil less it is important to keep it from overheating. Also, the gauge was defective and they want me to take it to a center to get it fixed so I bought an external gauge to avoid the hassle of it being in a repair shop for indeterminate time. Otherwise, the wheels and truck handles make it easy to move around and runs on 15 amp circuit with no problem."
1,Not Commercial Quality,"I bought this unit so I would have an air compressor that would keep up with common pneumatic tools. Well it won't. Using a 3/8"" ratchet, I end up waiting for it to catch up. Then the unit died, froze up and tripped the circuit breaker. It's been in the shop (factory repair center) for a month now and have no idea when it will be fixed. I wouldn't by this unit if your livelyhood depends on it. It's not even capable of being a decent home unit."
1,Rattle can construction,"This air compressor will rattle out most of its bolts within a year. The Pressure regulator will fail in about a year as well, be prepared to spend a lot of maintenance money keeping this piece running."
2,Noisy,I have had this compressor for a number of years. It has been a good compressor but very noisy and viberates a lot. The check valve has to be cleaned occasionally.
4,pastry cutter,heavier than expected. Very good when chopping/diceing vegetables to transfer them to pot from cutting board.
5,Simple but effective,This is a great tool in the kitchen. I now have two of them (two different kitchens) and love it. Best product of its type I've used. Highly recommend.
3,Given as Gift,"This item was purchased as a gift. It is exactly what the person wanted, so I believe it is a good product. The product was shipped in a timely manner, and arrived in great condition."
4,"Very sturdy, well-designed pastry cutter","This pastry scraper - like most everything Oxo makes is comfortable to use, well made and not bad to look at. It fits comfortably in your hand, has measurements on the blade which come in handy, and is very sturdy. Can't go wrong for the price."
4,Versatile and sharp.,I really like this chopper/scraper. It's sharp and has so many uses. I always have it ready when I'm making something in the kitchen. I don't really care for the rubber handle. Even though it's non-slip it just doesn't have that good earthy feel of wood. Good chopper overall though.
5,Well made excellent product,"This is a well made, heavy duty scraper. The edge is straight, the handle is comfortable. The size is just right, not too large to be bulky or too small to be efficient. Love it!"
5,pastry scraper,"Been making pies for 65 years, don't know how I did it so long without something similar to this product. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT"
5,Use it for everything!,"I can't say enough about this item. It is MORE than just a scraper - I also use it for cutting my toasted garlic bread, cutting fruits and vegetables. And yes - the best scraper in the world! I use it on my countertops when you can ""feel"" things left on but you can't see. I have used it to clean up spilled candle wax and my cookie sheets are so easy to clean now - just use thsi handy little scraper to scrape off the residue then a quick sponge wash - no more soaking! This thing never seems to dull - always ready to slice up something perfectly. I have even sliced tomatoes with this little tool. I am no purchasing two more (yes, I use it that much!)"
5,solid scraper!,"Solid blade, does'nt bend easy. Sharp edge with convenient 6 inch ruler markings on it. Handle is comfortable and solid. Well worth the money I spent!"
5,Helpful tool,"This is sharp enough to chop most items, plus it's easy to scoop them up...I feel like Rachael Ray when I use it!"
4,as expected,This simple item is just what you would expect. It has too much packaging over it but is mostly a slice of metal with a solid handle. You can get the same thing at lower prices by looking around. One star off for price.
5,love oxo,"I have a lot of OXO products, they are well made and hold up to daily use. This is a great tool for moving chopped veggies from cutting board to pan!"
3,$7.99 and Two reasons for choosing Oxo,This scraper's measurements are etched unlike the Kitchenaid's that are printed.The length is 6 inches whereas the Salton is not quite 6 inches.I'm getting this because of success with the Breadbaker's Apprentice book.
5,ESSENTIAL TOOL,"love it! I had been warned not get one that would allow gunk to get trapped and build up around the handle. I was about to give up my search for the 'perfect' scraper and just get a plastic trowel. I was actually shopping for something else when I saw it on Amazon. It's a great scraper, I use it daily. I highly recommend this one."
4,A Good Grips Good Tool,"This is great for measuring and dividing dough with clearly marked measurements and a sharp edge. I've put it through the dishwasher without any problems and love the easy to grip rubber handle. It gives a firm grip for wet or coated hands.The only problem with this tool is if you want to use it to lift chopped items off the cutting board. The handle doesn't allow you to get the blade flush with the cutting board for easy pick up.But for scraping dough off the board, a slight angle and a firm scrape do a great job of clearing and cleaning the board of any extra dough or flour."
4,"Good, not great","Wish is was bigger, but it gets the work done. Does a good job. Picks up all the chopped items on my cutting board in one full sweep. See the chefs use them, so why not I"
4,Plain and Simple,A classic take on the knife. This multipurpose item is a great and solid gift for any pursuant chef. Easy to clean is always a bonus - cold water and dry. I wouldn't suggest putting it in the dishwasher.
3,So/So,"Don't know if it is a true chopper, more of scraper and a measure before a chopping utensil. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but to call it a chopper...don't think so."
5,Simple and Effective,"I got tired of using various spatulas and knives for scraping the work surface when making doughs and other messy things. Finally did it... broke down and purchased the proper implement. The Oxo has a good, simple design and it just works. The handle is easy to grip and there's even a measuring scale along the edge for quick size references. This tool is simple and effective and the price isn't bad either."
5,OXO pastry scraper,"Great product, as good as I had expected. OXO has always provided consumers with the best tools for the kitchen."
4,using it,"I have intended to purchase one of these for a long time and just kept putting it off. I made the purchase, received the OXO PASTRY SCRAPER AND HAVE BEEN USING IT OFTEN. Regret I didn't purchase it at an earlier time. Great for dividing your dough, gives you a measurement on the blade, is comfortable to use and work with. Doing any dough or pastry work, buy it; works much better than the old butcher knife!"
4,OXO Pastry Scraper,I like this item. I use it to scoop up diced foods and removing excess dough after cutting cookies out with cookie cutters. Another ergonomic tool from OXO--a little heavy compared to others though.
5,Very Good Tool,I have used the scraper for several months and it is the best one. The grip hand is comfortable and the blade works very well for both a dough and the pantry board.
5,Wonderful!,Never had a Pastry Scraper/Chopper before and found it easy to get used to using. Made cutting egg noodles fast and easy to pick up and transfer to the drying area.
5,Good quality,"Very pleased with this pastry cutter. I've had it for about a month so far but have used it for several different pastries, etc. I would recommend this item."
4,Great bench scraper but poor packaging for shipment.,"This OXO Good Grips Bench Scraper works great! I've had it for 2.5 years and use it several times a week. Holds up well in the top rack of the dishwasher, wash after wash. Great for cutting dough into pieces, scraping dough off a board when kneading, or scraping up large amounts of chopped veggies from the cutting board. Like almost all OXO Good Grips items, the handle is super comfortable compared to similar items from other brands.The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because the way it was packaged when I received it. I had ordered a cast iron pan at the same time and the two items came in an extremely large box shipped together with no packaging around them at all. The pan sloshed around inside the box during the shipment and ended up bending the scraper before I even received it. I tried straightening it back out, but it has a permanent bend in it now. Too bad this excellent item was ruined by Amazon's poor packaging."
5,Love it!,"I wish I got this years ago. It's an excellent multi-tasker. Works well as a dough cutter, and the measurements on the blade help. You can scoop up tons of herbs and diced vegetables in one go, which would be tedious otherwise. The blade isn't sharp, but there's definitely an edge on it. I prefer using this utensil (even though I do own some high end knives) for cutting cucumbers, pineapple, watermelon, celery, layered tortilla pizzas, tofu, some desserts, etc.My only complaint is that there's a small chip missing from the blade after a few months of regular use. Still 5/5 though for the price."
4,"Great product, one thing missing",I love this chopper! It works great and I like the measurement lines on the edge of it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with a cover. I think it would be great if it came with something to protect it.
4,Good for pizza dough and flour cleanup!,"I use this for pizza dough cutting and also to scrap the counters clean of flour. It works quite well for both operations. I'm not certain how great it is for pastries. Seems quite nice. OXO usually makes high quality items, and this is no exception."
3,very nice,This product is great for cutting dough but I use it more for scraping my counter and my cutting boards! The measurements are nice. Mine has a few spots on it that resemble rust though and I've only had it 6 months. This may be where the coating is coming off?
5,Wonderful!,I love this bench scraper. It is both sturdy and tough! It works a million times better than my old one. It is a bit expensive but I think it is worth the money.
3,Oxo Pastry Scraper,"Bought this for picking up chopped items from cutting boards. (guess I watched too many cooking shows) Heavier than I imagined & blade very sharp. Very useful, but think a plastic scraper would have worked better for my purpose."
3,Good pulp fiction,"This is a collection of 13 short stories that first appeared in magazines in the late 1960's. The central character is Wolf Lannihan who works for International Insurance Investigators (Triple-I). He is a womanizer who mixes business with pleasure, sometimes putting pleasure first. In one story, he seduces a 16 year old girl before turning her over to the police. The stories are of mixed quality and length, some much better than others. Some of the plots are transparent, but overall they are interesting light reading."
1,"Waste of money, doesn't serve a purpose","I got a bunch of coupons for Glade products, and since I buy the air freshener and ran out of Air Wick, I decided to give Glade plug-ins a try. This was a complete waste of money. I couldn't smell a thing and have no desire to use Glade plug-ins anymore. I will continue to use their Rainshower and other water candles and air freshener. I even like the vacuum deodorizer, but the plug-ins leave much to be desired. I found Air Wick candles with this same scent and they worked immediately."
4,"Gale,s Review","Amazon,I am a retired Engineer and a Model Train Hobbyist. There is something very important missing from your ads regarding Hobby items. The Bachman train crossing set is a good likeness of the originals. There are so few of these (different brands) on the market so Bachman has the edge. Here is my complaint on this ad. There is no mention of the workings of the item such as electrical hook up yes or no. Are there any Electronics with it ?????? I think you miss a larger market on things like this because everyone wants things to up and down in and out and make noise.Thank you for listening and take this serious, it's not only Model Railroading.....etc that the same thing applies.........Customer Gale Brown @ galebrwn@yahoo.com"
5,"Awesome signals, but not for small kids...","Bought this for my son. He loves it. Encourages him to use his imagination. Not very sturdy though. My son is 5 years old and i have to remind him to be careful not to break them. So far, it's been 4 months, and he hasn't broken them. =)"
4,Cute,Cute and simple use for all HO scale trains. But nephew was excited to use immediately because there is no required assembly
1,mimi,I expected a more durable crossing replication and a larger size. They are very small and should only be used with minature trains sets.
4,"Lots of action, low on plot","This game plays like an x-rated film; flimsy plot, but you won't care cause the actions great.This has possilbe the best fighting controls I've seen, lots of moves, very configureable characters.One thing - you start with a whole bunch of characters right at the beginning; I found it best after replaying to pick four well-balanced members and stick with them (be sure to balance out the magic/fighting....)trying to develop everyone (I did that the first time) left ALL characters kind of behind.The mana egg development system is cool - no more casting spells just to build levels - spells are 'developed by crossing various mana eggs into more powerful eggs. Characters have personal skills that can be developed only by practise.there are only a handful of bosses, but you can fight them over again as you like. They're refreshingly difficult - defeating them is an accomplishment!Enjoy!"
1,How come there are so many foul words?,"The first Grandia had none at all. The seccond Had some. then we have Grandia Xtreme. In like the first couple of sentences there was a large number of them. The game is also a dungeon crawl, the enemies are not a challenge to beat, including the final boss, and the graphics are kind of cheesy. I hate the new battle system. Myam looks like her hair is made up of red banannas. I could go on forever about this horrible game."
2,Xtreme-ly Unmemorable,"Grandia Xtreme is the black sheep of the series. It shares a battle system with the other Grandia games, but little else. It's primarily a dungeon crawler. You spend most of your time slogging up and down a few relatively boring dungeons and have very little world exploration or character interaction compared to the first 2 games.It's story and characters are so uninteresting, that I can't remember a single character or location name. Whereas I can still remember most of the characters and places in the first Grandia game, even though I haven't played it since the year after it was released (years before I played Grandia Xtreme).If you want a mindless, fairly easy dungeon crawler, or you just want another game with the Grandia battle system, then this is your game. But most likely, you're better off looking elsewhere. Had it been the first Grandia game made instead of the 3rd, it might have gotten better ratings."
5,WHAT !!,"FOR people who give this album less than 5 star should learn more about metal, especially extreme metal, common people this is old schooll extreme thrash metal, what you expect more some melodic tune ? AND for people who curious about this album if you like reign in blood, you gonna love this, just crank this album up, and you gonna get an hour of head banging. just check Kreator new album Enemy of Gods, is a Great Album too."
5,Definalty five stars...only a moron wouldnt give this a five,"this is one unsisputed masterpiece i highly recomend it to anybody. Kreator is one of the most extreme/aggresive bands ever and this album is proof...it has everything...spine chilling guitars,snarling vocals,drumkits being put in submisson,bass lines being put into waste one after another(meaning great). best songs are the intro(very catchy),ripping corpse,pleasure to kill....actully all of em are classics. i dont need to say anymore except just buy this and trust me on this one...you wont regret it."
5,THE GODS AWAKEN,"I HAVE BEEN INTO ROCK AND METAL SINCE 1966 (THAT'S DAY ONE OF METAL , KIDS! ) KREATOR RANK AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL METAL ACTS OF ALL TIME. ""PLEASURE TO KILL"" DOES JUST THAT, DELIVERING ONE CRUSHING BLOW AFTER ANOTHER. ""AWAKENING OF THE GODS"" IS THE HIGH POINT OF THE ALBUM ,IN FACT DAMN NEAR THE HIGH POINT OF ALL METAL HISTORY!! THE ONLY (MINOR) COMPLAINT IS THAT SOME OF THE GUITAR SOLOS ARE SOMEWHAT UNDISCIPLINED AND INACCURATE.BUT LISTENING TO A LOT OF TONY IOMMI, YOU GET USED TO HEARING ACCURACY AND DISCIPLINE! BE THAT AS IT MAY, THE SONGS AND PLAYING ON ""PLEASURE TO KILL"" ARE WAY ABOVE THE AVERAGE METAL EFFORT. SO IF YOU WANT METAL THAT DELIVERS, KILL!!!!!!"
5,A Great Combo,"I purchased both this Red Spoon Spatula and the White Spoon. Neither have dis-colored, faded, warped or melt. This is a very versital spatula. I bought the spatulas for the handle. The flexible rubber fins on the steel handle create a very comfortable feel and will NOT transport heat up the handle. The oversized grips create a very ""ergonomic"" feel and fits my hands without having to tightly grip the handle.The spoon head is very flexible and yet sturdy. It can be used to stir the stiffist pancake mix or thickest chili and yet still clean the side of the bowl smooth. It can also go from normal room temperatures to stirring the soup, sauce or chili without fear of the blade melting or leaving ""that plastic taste"" in the pot.A great product with flexible uses and a staple in my kitchen."
3,good and bad,"Wow, another reviewer hit the nail on the head for me. I like this spoon, in theory. I like that it's red, because despite other claims, I've found that tomato sauce WILL stain my white and clear ones.But, like they said. I never want to use it, because the shaft is so damn flimsy. That plus the handle is almost TOO thick, and the combination of the two I find myself holding it by the shaft. I think I prefer thinner instruments, since I've been using these cheapo spoons I got at the supermarket rather than all my ergonomic stuff (oxo, kitchenaid..)Despite that, I would probably love it 100% if the shaft was totally rigid. The spoon part is flexible enough to make up for total ridgity in the shaft. (no snickering!)"
2,oxo needs to use the tools they sell.,"I like the fact that the spoon doesn't stain that is great, but I never want to use it because the shaft is so flimsy. So I recommend you buy it if you are only going to use for thin sauces. If you need a multi use spoon look somewhere else until they add a backbone to this one."
5,Oxo Good Grips Spatula,It is very comfortable in my hand and does not stain from red sauces. I like it very much
2,not my favorite,"The red scraper doesn't stain, that's great. It's heat resistant and won't melt or warp, that's great. The big thick Oxo grip that doesn't permit me to turn it easily in my hand to go around the entire pan, not great at all."
2,This is one Marsh that can be skipped,"The deficiencies here are glaring. Two of the victims are villains and the third hisses a few words, spits at one of the villains, and is gone, never to reappear except as a dead body. We don't miss any of them and don't really care who killed them. The central characters are never remotely in danger of being suspected. The most interesting feature of the story is a fictional twelth-century basilica built atop a third-century church, which had itself been built atop a house dating from Mithraic times. In all, a book without tension, suspense, or interest (except in the basilica)."
2,Not what I expected,"I have purchased O'Cedar mopheads for 20 years. They are usually yellow, and much fuller than the blue one I received. The only good comment I have is that there is cloth where there was plastic, so perhaps, this won't tear, as the plastic has in the past, necessitating replacement.I am very disappointed in this."
1,I've got the blues!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers' complaints! I got blue instead of yellow. Haven't even opened them yet, so don't know if they fit. I'll be going to a different site for these. Haven't decided yet whether it's worth the trouble to return them, or just throw them in the Goodwill box..."
4,Compelling History of Manhattan,"A romp through New York's sometimes jaded history with a view to uncover the roots of the modern metropolis and the singular element devised by architects to inspire (amuse?) the masses - the Skyscraper. The book looks at Coney Island as the testing ground of the Skyscaper, Manhatten as further exploration of the Skyscaper which is trialed in the name of symbols of a propserous future, economic rationale and pushing the envelope to its limits and finishes with Office of Metropolitian Architecture's own experimental projects in New York. A very compelling history of a complex city."
3,Competent look at the topic,"This feature looks at many of the matters surrounding the finding of the tomb, the principal characters, and the ""curse"". It also purports to find the answer to how Tutenkhamon died (I am not completely convinced). It is detailed and well resourced but could have been made more interesting (it drags a little in parts). There is also a litle too much of Dr Zawi Hawass (Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egypt) with his too definite opinions. Overall it is a good effort and worth purchasing."
3,Good DVD,Decent movie but a little slow. I wish they would have gotten to the good parts at the end a little sooner. Great photography of course & great history lesson of course.
1,Waste of Money!,It might work on wooden Cork's but it does not work on Plastic corks for Champagne. Waste of money!
5,It a Temptress Rock N Roll Party!!!!!,"Reminds me of my first time at Rocky Horror Picture Show, I knew all the words after the first listening. I saw Temptress in New Orleans, this records stands up to their live show. Overall, the CD is filled with fun party type tunes, I like Pills and Crack the Whip most, some songs are so tongue and cheeck... Same sense of humor as Offspring.."
4,Trippy Tribute To The Mary Chain.,"I'm so glad I found this CDEP. Worth the price of admission for the dreamy cover of ""DARKLANDS"", the title cut of the Jesus & Mary Chain's fab 1987 record. Best with headphones mainly, just LISTEN to it. It'll take you to a strange, wonderful, warm, fuzzy place. With the original JAMC version, yer in a sad and beautiful world. The Scream's cover version adds a few groovy colourz. ""I wanna goooo..."""
4,Excellent reference...,This book is well written and an excellent resource for ALL people. There is no one who wouldn't learn something.
5,Great for Beginning French,"I have purchased some books of this series in French and some in English, and read them interchangeably to my little girl. Hearing the same story in both languages is a good introduction to basic French. (You can get the books in French at Amazon.fr.)"
5,Excellent Foundation,"I found these 2 DVD's to be a great starting point for learning how to dance. First, dance foot positions are explained. Next, connection points are expalined. These serve as a foundation for all dances.Furthermore, the dance moves(i.e. Lunge, underarm turns) that were explained could apply to many different dances. Also, there was an excellent review at the end of each DVD to summarize what was taught.This DVD seies would be a great place to start if one has never danced before."
5,Completely satisfied,We were completely satisfied with Shawn's slow dancing dvds and we'll definitely be back for more.
2,Not much info about the track life,"This book is probably good for someone who has never had greyhounds. I have had non-track greys. I got this book to learn about the particulars of the rescues off the track as I was interested in fostering. I really didn't learn very much at all that I didn't already know. Now I'm reading the Racing Greyhounds for Dummies book. I haven't finished it yet, but I already like that one a lot better."
3,For beginners in dogs,"This book has good information on racing greyhounds, but most of it is general dog care and training. I would like it if the potential problems with adopting a racing greyhound were laid out more clearly, especially the possibility of danger to small dogs and cats. The rescue people do a good job of trying to evaluate dogs for this problem, but they simply can't offer a guarantee. Greyhounds are very sweet and generally easy keepers, but they do suffer from improper early socialization. Clearly the book wants to encourage adoption, but as with any adoption, people need to know there can be problems."
4,GREYT READ,"Excellent and informative.However, the 'as new' copy of the book I received was written in and the text was highlighted in several places."
5,If you plan to adopt a greyhound BUY THIS BOOK!,"The only comprehensive book available on the topic. An invaluable aid for making the decision to adopt an ""ex-racer."" She covers the adoption process, bringing your dog home, what to expect, and offers a complete index of all Greyhound adoption groups in the U.S"
5,A must have,This is a have to for anyone thinking about rescuing your first greyhound. I just adopted my first greyhound and this book is my bible..When I have a questions or need support I turn to this book for answers and assurance. The author gives you down to earth practical information about what to expect from your new greyhound.
5,Complete and quick...,"This book is a must read for all potential adopters! It is a very complete work, containing all the information one would need regarding greyhounds. In addition, the book is a fairly quick read. Branigan does an excellent job of taking you through the post-adoption process, including all of the hazards one may encounter if not prepared - - stairs, supplies, and sensitivity to certain medicines. Although there is a lot of information available on the net (that I also read), I would strongly suggest reading this book as Branigan compiles everything you need in one concise book. Finally, I helped the ex-racer cause out a little more by going through the adopt-a-greyhound site to purchase the book from amazon."
5,Greyhounds,"This is absolutely the best book to read if you are interested in finding out more about greyhound adoption. The information is clear, accurate, and very well written. Consider this your greyhound ""Bible""."
4,OK Reference,I preferred Retired Racing Greyhounds for Dummies. This book seems somewhat outdated. Had some good stuff in it but given a choice between the 2 go for the Greyhounds for Dummies book.
4,Teachers take note of this gem,"Looking for a new way to make Mark Twain come alive in your classroom? Help your students travel back in time by engaging in some of the wonderful projects in The American Boy's Handy Book by Daniel Carter Beard. Aside from illustrating some of Twain's work, Beard was an avid educator who also was a co-founder of the Boy Scouts of America. He wrote their first Boy Scout Handbook and was a lifelong advocate of making your own fun. This treasure of a book will suggest projects for your class which will help them understand the world of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Make kites in the shape of stars, turtles, shields and dragons. Build your own giant bubble machine or a Puss in Boots puppet show (script is included). Avoid the more violent blow guns and fighting kites but enjoy the simplicity and just plain fun of this book. Along the way, your students will have a new appreciation for Mark Twain's world and the boys he wrote about."
4,The American Boy Handy book,"This book goes back to the eartly 1900's. It was before boy scouts came into existanc. Thre were many handy illustrations of how to make a dug out canoe, build a tent, make a fishing pole. It was so interesting to see how people had fun in the outdoor before all oof the luxeries of toeday. I have used this book as a research tool for my next book."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"I was really disappointed in this title.... It was written in 1890 and it's totally outdated. As an interesting browse in the library or book store, maybe. The stuff it talks about is simply impractical for most kids. Topics range from taxidermy at home, raising wild birds, to making blowguns. I was looking for things I could do with my young kids, and this didn't fit the bill for me."
5,40 years with this book,"A copy of this book has been in my life for over 40 years. We never hurt anyone, poked out an eye or did property damage from projects in the book. Yes there are some racial references that we may consider as politically unfortunate now. Parents should be aware of the nature of the projects and language in this book and guild their children. It can also bring up lessons on the environment and nature based on our current world views. A great book with so many fun ideas from our past"
5,this book kicks,"An excellent book. I read it when I was 12 years old. It is the perfect book for any guy or girl that loves the outdors.(is outdors spelled right?) Well anyways, this is the best book that has ever been written for people that are in any way the least bit cool. I love it, and you would too."
5,A wonderful book of projects and toys a child can make,"I read this book in the fourth grade and did many of the projects, Trapping, camping, snow forts, skits and plays, magic, all the things an American boy (or girl for that matter) will find exciting and fun.I have given the American Boys Handy Book to the children of many of my friends. It will spur anyone's creative thinking, young or old!If you like this one check out the American Girls Handy Book written by Beard's sister."
5,The American Boy's Handy Book,"I bought this for my urban, ""not-into-reading"" nephews when they were 11 and 9 years old, thinking that they might not ever crack the cover, yet today (they are now 17 and 15) I found it in their bookcase well-worn. They say they've really enjoyed it, and tried several of the projects. Although its style is antique, and not quite as easy to follow as the ""...for Dummies"" type of how-to books, and some of the topics may no longer be of interest, I highly recommend it for all kids (boys and girls). I am buying it for my young daughters (and myself), expecting our family will enjoy it for many years to come.Topics include ""Snowball Warfare"" and a whole section on Winter, ""Home-Made Boats,"" ""Novelties in Soap Bubbles,"" ""How to Camp Out without a Tent,"" ""Dogs,"" ""How to Make Puppets and a Puppet Show,"" and ""How to Make Various and Divers Whirligigs.""If you want to get your kids out from in front of the TV or computer and foster their creativity, buy this book and open it!"
4,Every boy needs ...,a book like this to work from. Lost skills that just need to be brought back into the life of our young men. Get them out from in front of the TV and video games and get their hands busy building!
3,Jeepers,"An enjoyable and easy read. The language is a little too ""Pleasantville"" in that there is an overuse of exclamations such as ""jeepers"", ""golly"" and their ilk. If the language weren't quite so cute, it would be a better book."
4,"ah, mucky pup","good memories. fun band and actually played well to boot. their first and best ain't on here, ""can't you take a joke"" (heavy and raw even by today's standards), but follow-ups ""boy in a man's world"" and ""now"" are pretty good too, even as it laid out the deviated and somewhat listener-friendly path they would eventually settle on. you guys still alive?5 stars for 'joke', 'boy' and 'now' get 3.5. i have spoken."
1,do NOT buy this movie if you love animals,"While there is some ""campy"" value in seeing Frankie Avalon in a safari pic .... the failings far out weigh any other value the film may have.This pic includes some actual footage shot in Africa, and the rules about filming animals were much different then. This film contains actual footage of an Elephant being shot in the head and killed.Do NOT buy this movie if you like animals. The scenes will stay with you. Very disturbing."
4,Lovable and fun to listen,"listening to the first track you might expect one thing from this record, (heavy percussion, few vocals) but as you listen through you are pleasantly surprised. There is great vocal, instrument and arrangement work, it does feel like a complete record. The Pet Shop Boys always surprise me, their music is less self-righteous, more commercial, without compromising their indistinguishable style."
3,Whatever happened to...,"""Saturday Night Forever""? This isn't one of my favorite PSB albums, but I surely enjoyed SNF. I wish they included it in their Nightlife Tour DVD and POP ART."
3,Ever wish you listened to more...?,"I remember when I first heard this CD at a music store that allowed you to preview it. I heard the first four tracks, and man, I was sold!! This album rocked!!Then I listened to the rest of it after I bought it and wished that I hadn't paid full price. The first four tracks WERE IT as far as I was concerned and the rest of the album seemed far from imaginative compared to the beginning where it felt like they were breaking some new ground--especially the natural (not electronic) rhythm exhibited in the first 2 tracks!!Not bad to listen to, but get a bargain price on it if you can."
3,Pet Shop Boys - Single-Bilingual,"Hmm, SINGLE-BILINGUAL (as a stand-alone track) isn't the most scintillating that the Pet Shop Boys have done. ""Discoteca"" is more interesting, putting the Spanish-lite vocals and Spanish-tinged rhythms to better use. Still, the track doesn't quite come all together. ""The Calm Before the Storm"" is more typical and put-together: gentle vocals, pretty arrangements. Interestingly, the Trouser Enthusiasts' take on ""Discoteca"" actually puts the disco back into the track, improving it. The Pet Shop Boys' own extension of ""Discoteca"" actually makes better sense than the shortened version, adding a nice string intro and giving a real disco feel to those drums and the (almost random) Spanish chanting. ""Confidential"" sounds like a throwback to their showtune days -- in other words, it's classic Pet Shop Boys. I only wonder how it would sound with Tuna Turner. Baby Doc's mixes of ""Single-Bilingual"" and ""Discoteca"" go for a harder, more progressive dancefloor sound. Nice."
3,Bilingual Limited,"Bilingual Limited being Pet Shop Boys 10th album and their 6th of entirely new music and contained six singles. These being ""Before"", ""Se a vida é (That's the way life is)"", ""Single-Bilingual"", ""A red letter day"", ""To step aside/Se a vida é (That's the way life is)"" and ""Somewhere"". The booklet has all the lyrics and some interesting photos. This is an alright release and I give it 3/5."
5,Very infectious album,"I had purchased this album once and lost it. Then came the expanded edition and finally I added it back to my collection, and what an addition it made. This PSBs at their best with the latin melodies they so flawlessly blended into their signature. From the booming drumlines to the soothing guitar notes this album is great to just sit back and listen to than dance around with. This expanded edition is hard to find but well worth the search."
5,Absolutley Fabulous,"I know that most psb fans can't stand ""Bilingual"" simply because it doesn't have the same cheesy synth-poppy sound. Quirky lines like ""I love you, you pay my rent"", have now been replaced by ""And after work explain how I feel...""perdamo! me llamo Neil"" (yes, I know that's spelled wrong, but that's how it sounds) The boys have gone out on a limb this time adding the pounding beats of traditional drumming with a techno twist. Although it is a bit campy, (which isn't a bad thing at all), the PSB experiment with noise that is more appealing to the tastes of today, not just those of us who spend too much time in gay bars. If you are hesitant, just buy it used...it's something everyone needs to hear."
3,"Pet Shop Boys failed to do a good ""Very"" follow up...","I am a big fan of the boys, but Bilingual is far away from what I was waiting for. I did not like the latin rhythms included in some songs (""Discoteca"", ""It Always Comes As A Surprise"", ""Single"") even if the melody are good. However, ""Se A Vida É"" is the best song of the album. The complete album is not homogenic, so we go through a style into another. It's very confusing. Some songs here might have been better as B-sides (""Electricity"" is kind of experimental), as some others are totally boring (which is rare for the boys, but ""Saturday Night Forever"" is just not a good song, and ""To step aside"" is annoying with those pilgrims singing...). Check out for the single versions of ""A Red Letter Day"" and ""Single-Bilingual"": they are far better on the singles than on the album. So, finally, 3 stars..."
2,"A huge disappointment, to say the least!","After the eloquent crisis of ""Behaviour"" and the utter euphoria of ""Very"", ""Bilingual"" represents a major anticlimax for the Pet Shop Boys.I was absolutely shocked to hear the monotonous, tuneless rhythms of Discotecca, Single and Metamorphosis after looking so forward to this album! It appears PSBs have tried to incoporate somewhat of a Spanish theme into this album, but they have not followed it through! What we end up with, then, is an awful pastiche of discordant Latin American rhythms and woeful electronica.Perhaps i'm being a bit harsh on PSB. The album does, after all, pick up in the middle with the pleasant - if innocuous - ""Se La Vita E."" And the album's highlight - ""A Red Letter Day"" - would have been certainly worthy of inclusion on ""Very"" or ""Behaviour.""Nonetheless, this is incredibly disappointing given the talent of the PSBs!"
5,Great!,"One of the best books written on the subject this title was a revelation for me and my company and it helped me with every step I had to take in developing a successful business. The book is a gold mine of information and advice that is given by specialists and has lots of information on how to contact important people or companies. A must have book for anyone looking to enter the business and for novices to. My best buy yet, I recommend it to all, don't hold back and buy it"
5,unbelievable,"As far as organization goes my office hasn't been up there with the best i might say, there were always conflicts brewing about the density of contact information that was stockpiling in our file cabinets and we realized that we needed to make a change. That change came with the purchase of this book, a great title that i recommend to all"
5,great,"This directory is the one that i stuck with out of a selection of at least 10 books because this is the absolute best. Nothing even comes close to this, I’ve seen spelling errors, wrong information, misprints and a lot of structure problems, but none in this book. I'm happy with my choice and i advise others not to look for something else, this is it"
1,I was expecting better from Panasonic,"I bought these even though there weren't any reviews on them, because I have had good experiences with other Panasonic products. I guess I ended up as the Guinea Pig, because these headphones simply do not do what they promise. The main purpose for buying them is the noise cancellation. I tried them during an airplane trip and I could not hear a difference in ambient noise when I turn the switch on or off. I have experienced other noise cancelling headphonses (Bose and Sony/Aiwa) and there is a very perceptible noise reduction.Other than the fact that they don't work, the design is very cheap. The roll up mechanism doesn't work too well and the case is bulky and made from cheap plastic."
3,Buy something else,"Not bad for straight ear buds, not very good for noise canceling earphones. Buy something else."
4,A Little Whirlwind,"I was initially sceptical about the performance of this item, but I live on a hillside where raking is difficult, and decided it was worth a try as I was ordering a multi-attachment string trimmer anyway. The Amazon review indicated it would fit brands other than Poulan, and I was certainly happy when it snapped right on to my new Troy Bilt trimmer. The Amazon review also said the blower would produce a 150 mph jet of air, which I dismissed as ad hype.I was wrong.This blower BLASTS! I kicks up a duststorm of leaves, gravel, small branches, and the occasional garden gnome. I works great for my hillside situation, allowing me to jet out leaves from under bushes and garden structures from 20 feet away, and cut my raking time from over an hour to just minutes. I would have given this unit 5 stars, but I have only used it for 2 weeks, and I have no idea of its durability over time."
3,Poulan Pro PP3000B Blower Trimmer Attachment,"The blower is primarily made of plastic parts. Hopefully it is durable enough to last a while. It produces a strong wind as a blower attachment. Because it is attached to the end of the power supply shaft and can only be used in the primary button hole, the direction of exhaust is limited to a horizontal plane at ground level. If you want to blow down on the target such as leaves, it is very difficult to raise the blower up at an angle because the length of the power shaft plus the attachment shaft are a little too long and the motor ends up next to your ear.I think for the price, its capability, and attachment convenience, it is a reasonably good purchase. Its use should be limited to simple, homeowner gardening applications."
3,Very Handy. Not as much power as other reviews,"This is a very handy blower attachment and is far better than corded blower I previously used, due to flexibility. But the power I experienced is not consistent with that of other reviewers. Also, some spots require you to hold the blower at ackward angles to get maximum velocity. This would not be necessary with separate gas blower. In hindsight, I would not purchase again since cost is very near that of a stand-alone gas blower. There's a lot to be said for having an extended windshaft at the end of a blower. My B-D electric $35 previous blower had more power."
4,blower attachment,"This blower is fantastic. I have a 33cc poulon pro trimmer. This blower is quickly attached and switched with the trimmer. Works well. Saves money as i don't have to purchase a blower and trimmer. I am interested in the edger attachment as well. Only negative is that i hoped for for blowing power, although there is plenty of power for the jobs i am doing. Would definitely recommend this product!"
4,It works.,"It works okay but it is a little awkward to use at times. On occasion you have to tilt the blower to actually aim at the leaves etc. you are trying to move, this can be somewhat difficult and bothersome. The good thing is that the engine you are using is probably already warmed up and you don't have to cold start another engine after you are done trimming your lawn."
3,Blower,"I maintain 3 properties, I have a back pack blower, bought this as a back up or for small jobs, works well, fairly powerful, good for small properties & back up!!"
3,"Good Value, Beats a Broom.","This blower made quick work of blowing grass clippings off of 100+ feet of sidewalk, large driveway and large back patio. Seemed to do a good job rounding up the few remaining sycamore leaves in the yard. Only negative, it's a little difficult to hold at the right height when operating. This is the only leaf blower I've ever used, so I can't compare to others."
3,Yep,Not a bad blower I was short on space and didnt want to buy multiple gardening tools. It is a little difficult to operate since (as other reviewers have said) you have to hold it at certain angles to get the right velocity and power to blow stuff. The engine will literally be right next your ear and you can feel the heat from the motor on your neck. With a little design tweeking I think it would work much better especially if there were a longer valve at the end that pointed down. This model is about ten to fifteen bucks cheaper than the craftsman model.
3,Probably not the best for an Elementary Fluids course,"The title of this book is misleading--there is nothing elementary in this book. Flipping through this book one will probably become intimidated by sheer volume of ""difficult math"". This book might be of great help in a graduate level Fluid Mechanics course, but the definitions, derivations, and concepts in general are too difficult for an undergraduate. If you have a good instructor, he or she will probably be able to simplify things for you, otherwise the book will teach you nothing. Many of the problems/examples, however, seem to be simple enough and can be solved using simple equations, so one wonders why the text goes in to so much detail using esoteric mathematics. If you are an undergraduate, and your instructor makes you buy this book, be sure to get some sort of supplementary outline book, or else you will probably be lost."
1,Horrible textbook,"This is not a textbook for undergraduates. This class isn't meant to be simple though. The examples worked in the book are not even relatively close to the problems your professor will assign. The homework problems are simple, but the book cannot teach you how to work them out as simple as they are. I bought one of those ""2500 fluid mechanics problems"" in order to do the homework. Finding a solutions manual is pretty tough as well."
4,Really good dvd,"My mother, who is fairly religious, bought this for me years ago. I guess she wanted to add a little Christianity in my workout!The video is really good. You get an affective workout, without it being too strenuous. You'll definitely work up a sweat. There is gospel music, which is good and upbeat. Billy Blanks is a great instructor, offering words of inspiration and encouragement without being preachy.I just wish they would make a DVD version of this video."
3,"Rates a 10 on the Goofy scale, but was fun anyway.","This book is certainly 'alternative' religion, expressing a loving flower-child view of the hereafter. Silly as it was I still found some food for thought. It sure would be nice if the universe was indeed such a warm, fuzzy, loving place, but that hasn't been my experience.For my part, I lean more toward Tennyson's view ""nature, red in tooth and claw."" If that isn't very comforting, well who said reality should be comforting?"
2,ok,"i just heard they are with soul assassins i think. wow i'm not surprised, they are good. but not their best album."
5,Underrated group,"This album is fantastic, One of their best, I have all their albums and this one has so many standout tracks its sick. bottom line...Get this album"
2,"production reaches far, album falls short","I appreciate Rob the Vikings production, it's creative, dark, and lasting. Unfortunately, I have always thought of SM as lyrically stale and suffering bad delivery. I agree with Constant's comments. I'd rather listen to the other S&M, Slug and Murs, that is. Both of their Tribute albums are fresh. Or Deep Puddle Dynamics for the dark sound and ultra intellectual lyrics (infused with a pretentious aire of grandeur, if you will - sorry I had to, I heard Bob Novak say it). Or Cannibal Ox, futuristic yet timeless production, lyrics from the streets. Or Deltron 3030, produced by Dan the Automator. Need more classic albums, talented producers need to team with talented MCs."
2,Lame,"This game is lame. I can't get past the second level. It's too hard and I can't figure out what to do!!It's nothing like the online game of Turbo Turtle, so don't be fooled like I was!"
3,"The story is OK, the Redemption DVD quality is not","For those familiar with the Burke and Hare tale, (as also done in ""The Doctor and the Devils"" and ""Flesh and the Fiends""), the story is familiar. There's a bit of fooling around to be had here, a bit of bumbling comedy, some womanizing, all mixed in with the more ""grave"" material. I did enjoy this to a point, but boo and hiss to Redemption for the quality of this DVD, which is quite poor. This is the best print they could come up with? I think my old New World Video VHS was better. I wonder if Redemption would have put something of this quality out if they were still affiliated with Image Entertainment?At any rate, the film does have a rather fun theme song courtesy of Scaffold, a band featuring Mike McGear, who is Paul McCartney's brother.But the DVD quality....OY! 3 out of 5 stars..."
2,No chance for Redemption,"Gave it a shot just due to Redemption promoting it - but there are other more current films out there if you like the ""Burking"" films (which I do) and this is a good example of some old drive-in fare films .... but will just bore you, really. Just not a film that really would have had a fan or a cult base at any stage and was one of the types that probably (and ain't changed much)only got folks in due to a bit of partial nudity posters and promo art - then figured story development no longer had importance."
1,A Misleading Advertisment,it does say that it comes with a psp and the game hustle but thats not what it comes with. It only comes with a sound system. which is ok I guess. so if that is what you want then order but if not then don't.
1,trashing a release gets me 0 helpful votes...yea well.....,"how can a band follow up one of the greatest death metal albums ever recorded with this? Luckily, The Eyes of Horror was back to the basics, because Beyond the Gates was not very good. Forgetable songs and just an awful sounding production. Just buy '7 Churches' and 'Eyes of Horror' and make those the only possessed you ever hear. A sophomoric jinx rings true with this release."
2,Can anyone say research?,"I started out liking this book. It was different, it had a story, and the writing is good, engaging, well paced.But now I'm not so sure. Should I even finish it?The writer has the heroine reading a Jane Austen book. I've seen this done before and it aggravates me to no end. In her time, when her books were being published, Jane Austen's name was NOT on the book. Not until several years after it was published did Jane's name appear on Pride and Predjudice.Please authors, do a simple Google search before you put anything so easily checkable in print, for God sakes! It makes everything else in the book HIGHLY questionable."
1,Nothing more than dollar store quality index cards,I've had recipe cards in the past that were heavy cardstock. These aren't worth the paper the lines are on. Very thin and not coated like others I have.
5,Recipe Cards,The recipe cards arrived quickly and was as shown. I would like to see additional style of cards. I am very pleased.
2,Big Disappointment,"Shaggy is absolutely one of the best Jamaican artists. This CD however in no way compares to his other. I loved Hot Shot and was very disappointed with this one. Shaggy put too much emphasis on his 2nd home and ""American"" roots. Shaggy should stick to what he is a master at and that is ""Reggae"" and leave the American influence out of his work. It does him no justice and hinders his many talents. Kind of like ""if something is not broke, do not try and fix it"". Shaggy, go back to REGGAE, Please. I love you Mr. Lover, Lover!"
3,This is not Reggae.............,"For all of you who consider this to be reggae, well it just isn't. I like Shaggy as a performer and he has some really good dance vibes, but those of you who put this CD down becuase it doesn't sound like reggae, well it shouldn't becuase it isn't and never will be. If you want TRUE reggae buy Bob Marley, Steel Pulse, or Burning Spear cd's. These are real reggae performers and you won't be dissapointed."
3,Huh?,"I am not a huge fan of reggae music, but when I heard Shaggy's Boombastic song when I was in 9th grade I thought he was pretty darn good. I have been a supporter ever since. He has had some great songs over the years (Summertime, Wasn't Me, Angel, Love Me Love Me, Hope, Oh Carolina, Sexual Healing, Eye of the Tiger, Sexy Lady, Strength of a Woman), but still no solid album. I think you should make a Shaggy greatest hits from Kazaa and be content with that. Just use the songs I mentioned and find a couple more you like. Just not worth the money."
2,Disappointed...Disappointed!,"I am a huge Shaggy fan and couldn't believe how much I loved the ""Hotshot"" album on which EVERY single song was great which I think is extremely unusual. I was psyched to hear his new stuff but it just doesn't cut it. It's pretty monotonous and not real danceable...just nothing hooked me. I will continue to keep an ear out for more from him but this one? Nah."
4,A PRETTY LUCKY DAY INDEED!,"Well, for all of you who enjoyed Shaggy's last album, HOTSHOT, you will surely enjoy this one. It is very similar in theme and more cohesive than HOTSHOT. He has many fun dance reggae tracks on SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE, FULL CONTROL, HEY SEXY LADY, GET MY PARTY ON (WITH THE AWESOME CHAKA KHAN), LUCKY DAY....then the second half of the cd switches to more songs with great beats but more thought provoking lyrics....this is a very enjoyable listen! The only complaint is that many of the songs sound the same....I would like more diversity next time out! But, that aside, a fun listen! Also, there is an unlisted 15th track which is a remix of STRENGTH OF A WOMAN!"
3,"Different than Hotshot, Ok in its own right","If you're looking for the energy that was found in Hotshot, Lucky Day is not the answer. Shaggy has gone for a slower, mellower approach that may not appeal to all listeners.Each track sounds very similar, and none of the 15 tracks will get anyone out on the dance floor.""Hey Sexy lady"" is the best song on the album, and there are 2 versions (Song #15-hidden). This song will appeal to the TRL crowd, but won't get the worldwide recognition like ""Angel"" or ""Wasn't Me""It seems like one of those B-side albums thrown out there, riding on the heals of a previous hit, just to make a few bucks.When not comparing the album to Hotshot, it is OK in its own right. I can see grooving to some of the tunes with my sexy lady, although I don't expect the room to be rockin'."
1,Not for cake icing,"This tool may have some other uses that I don't know of, but it is just too flimsy for icing cakes with anything other than whipped cream. I think it's also much too short and narrow for the job, but that's probably a personal preference."
3,too flimsy,"Ok I bought this b/c I wanted a icing knife that was long enough to do the whole top of a 9 inch circle cake (what I typically bake). Unfortunately, while the knife is long like I wanted, it is too flimsy and flexible to do much else. I can't stir the frosting w/ it unless I want to do a weak job, I can't frost the sides b/c of it's flimsiness, etc. So, OXO, please make a more sturdy long knife if you haven't already!"
1,useless,"The blade is so thin, your just about able to spread soft whipped cream with. Forget frosting or any kind of batter. It's a complete waste of money"
2,Not my favorite,I bought this for my daughter for icing cakes. We tried it out last weekend and decided I was not happy with the design. I thought a straight edge works better for frosting a cake. I found myself gripping the blade instead of the handle.
4,Probably the best affordable design to date,"The size and double compartment along with the stand, make this the perfect pill storage system. If one is conscientious, it is almost impossible to make mistakes!The only suggestion for improvement would be to devise a way for containers to stay open and lay flat... of course, I am not sure how!!!With that said, based on poor experiences with other med dispenser trays, I definitely recommend this one. Just take your time filling and stacking them back in the tray!All the best,Jay"
1,be careful,"Be careful when you purchase this item. I purchased it to deal with my handfull of nighttime and morning meds. I wrongly assumed that the 2 compartments had separate lids, this was not the case, its just one big lid. This means that you cannot just open the pm side and empty it into your hand, you either have to cover the am side with something or pick the pills out.The pods are made of a flimsy feeling plastic. The tabs by which you open the lid are thin, so thin in fact that after filling each pod and using it for 2 days i have already broken 2 tabs.The concept is a good one, there are, however, better ones available."
3,Good but not perfect,"I was looking for a slightly larger holder for my pills, and this one works nicely. My only real complaint is that each container dosnt sit very well into the tray. Even if you slightly bump it they have a tendancy to want to fall off the tray. And I especially would not carry this thing from room to room when it was full."
2,Not practical,"The biggest problem with this vitamin holder is that the individual cases don't attach to the base. So if you want to take them all with you, you have to take 7 separate cases along. They should have made them click into the white base. It's hard to transfer them without them wobbling."
1,Small compartments!,"Listing says ""holds up to 25 pills or tablets"" they must mean pills the size of a grain of rice. I'd return it but it ain't worth the trouble."
4,Cool idea!,"I Like it... Definitely allows me to keep track of my meds intake. But it would have been better if the am/pm slots had separate openings. Besides that, its a cool product.."
3,Its good,"I use it almost daily and its good but the print removed after few washing, i dont use the days on it i just use it as a medicine containers when i go out"
4,Works for what I need,"Plenty of room for large vitamins or the occasional cold pill when necessary, it works great for helping me remember my vitamins. I simply get the week ready and grab the proper day in the morning and go. The only negative thing I have to say is I wish there was a separate door for AM and PM so it was easier to dump your morning and evening meds out. Other than that, glad I bought it"
3,Not as great as I'd hoped,"The rounded daily pillboxes are more comfortable in my pocket than my previous rectangular ones with sharp edges, and they snap shut tightly and stay shut (which isn't the case with some other pillboxes).Unfortunately, the tray that holds all 7 pillboxes has only shallow slots for each to rest upon, so even a gentle nudge or jostle of the table it's on, or to the side of the tray, will send all the pillboxes scattering. It's happened dozens of times already and is rather frustrating. If they'd get a better tray to hold the 7 boxes more securely, I would definitely give this weekly pill-minder a better rating."
4,Love it!,"The only thing I would change on this item would be the size. It is a bit big, but it is fairly useful. Great for anyone on the go!"
2,Apex Pocket Med,"Well, I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this item.The seller is fine, shipped it fast, etc. No problems there.It was just a little cheaply made for being over 6 dollars. The main issue is it the little pill containers don't stay latched very well. Considering the cost of medication, I really need a container that stays latched, losing meds I can barely afford as it is, is not an option for me.This device only works as a stationary pill holder/organizer, and you better be careful when you pick it up, because they come open VERY easily.Sigh... I'll use it until I find something better.I have to put the containers in a sandwhich baggy to be on the safe side. That way when they come open I don't lose my meds."
3,"good, but needs some work.","This is a great little pill pack. It would be nice if each side opened separately. I think it might be harder for older folks to get one side at a time, ( it is for me and I'm 59. Someone with a whole skew of pills twice a day can get them mixed up easily. Also the 7-day tray is very fragile, the slightest bump and all of the days fall off. You have to have it on a sturdy surace and somewhere that you don't have to move it around. But, it's a great idea."
3,Not Bad,"I like this product however there are two things I would like to see made differently. 1) The top should be split between AM and PM so when you open the case the only pills exposed are those you are taking. Currently when you open AM, PM opens as well. 2) The cradle indentions could be a little deeper for a better fit. Over all I like the product, great size"
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"These things are very convientent. I am constantly forgeting to take my vitamins and these are great becuase they fit in my purse, don't accidentally open, and are a constant reminder to take my vitamins. The only downside is they tend to tip over when I'm filling them, so I have to prop teh lid open with something, but it's not a big deal. Very secure and I love that they are colorful and don't make me feel self-concious about the amount of vitamins and pills I have to take."
4,Good Item for the Price,"A decent item for a decent price. Each 'day' has 2 chambers, 1 for day and 1 for night. This comes in handy as I have to take meds then. They're easy to put in your pocket if you travel too."
3,GET ORGANIZED??,THIS STORE IS HORRIBLE I ORDERED TWO PILL HOLDERS FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND FOR WHEN WE TRAVEL. WELL MY ORDER NEVER CAME. I WROTE AT LEAST 4 E-MAILS TO THE STORE NO ANSWER. WE TODAY I GET A PACKAGE I FIGURE GREAT FINALLY NOW I CAN PACK OUR MEDS FOR OUR TRIP. OPENED THE BOX !!! SURPRISE WRONG ITEMS. PLEASE NEED I SAY MORE.
1,Would not by again.,Again was looking for something smaller to set on my counter. This one opens to both am amd pm pills that the same time. Not useing this at all.
5,Great for travel,I love that these are daily portables. I take some vitamins at work with my lunch and these are great because I don't have to bring whole the container with me like my other pill cases. They also hold a lot of vitamins.
3,Size incorrect in product description,"These pill boxes are much bigger than I expected because the product information provided by Amazon is inaccurate. The correct overall dimensions are 2.5"" x 3.5"" x 8"" while each individual box is 2"" x 2 3/4"" x 3/4""."
3,use it twice each day,these little pill boxes are handy at home and traveling. i would like them better if when you opened them you were not exposing am and pm at the same time as this would allow me to dump them into my hand instead of pick them from the container one at a time
2,complicated,these are complicated to use and open. had to buy different ones. i gave these to my 2 year old to play with.
4,Gets the job done.,The delivered product looks just like the picutres on Amazon. Each half holds at least 4-5 large pills. Great for people looking to carry workout supplements.
4,Love this little compartments,"I was looking for a pill box that would be cute enough to carry, and able to carry at least four pills twice a day. This one is easy to fill and not too big and bulky. The only thing I have to remember is to take them out of my purse and fill them back up."
3,Easy to fumble,"These individual pill packets are probably fine for those on the go who take a day's worth along or who have few pills to take; however, those with more than a half dozen will have trouble getting them to fit if the medicine is in large capsules and/or tablets. For older adults or some having large hands, filling the Apex Med Pack can be problematic. With the lid open, they will not lay flat easily for loading and can be knocked over readily. The packs don't form a tight seal, so don't plan on taking them to the pool."
5,Pocket Med Pack is excellent,"With all my presciptions & vitamins, all other pillbox organizers that I have found were simply too small. By buying 2 of these, 1 for AM and 1 for PM, I finally have what I've been looking for. It's comfortable in my pocket, yet big enough for my needs."
