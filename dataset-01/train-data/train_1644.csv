2,Patches Pals!,Not exactly an educational toy or one you'd play with but I think its fun in just having it. Its a great reminder of my JP Patches Pal days when I was a little kid.
1,This television isn't good.,"The T.V. has a tendency to shut of by itself and to get it to turn back on, you have to hit the side of it really hard. The left speaker also doesn't work and the input in the back tends to make a fuzzy picture. I wouldn't recomend it, but it's up to you if you want to buy it. To try and solve this problim, I took it to my local T.V. repairman and he said that it could not be fixed. His words were ""Its just the result of lazy workmanship. People just don't take the time that they used to when making their products. U.S. workers, for the most part just don't take the pride in their work that they used to."" He just left the shop, griping and grumbling. So unless you want to be lectured by your T.V. repairman like I was, dont buy this television."
3,High expectations unexpectedly dashed on the rock of mediocrity,"The long awaited first feature film by a Lebanese director and actress Nadine Labaki was a great disappointment to me.With so much talent and perfection displayed by Labaki in her other works; I expected an earth shaking topic and performance.Films exploring virginity, homosexuality, the other woman and poverty are very well travelled roads and didn't need an extra repetetion. In her defense; perhaps Labaki wanted to distract the world from the all-too-frequent subject of war and focus on the Lebanese as humans with everyday problems and feelings. I had, correctly or incorrectly, higher expectations for this movie."
3,Arab Chick Flick - But Pretty Good!,"Sort of a Lebanese ""Sex in the City."" These beauty parlor companions - one of whom is the smokin' hot Nadine Labaki -- in Beirut use caramel as a depilatory.Through the twists and turns of their ambitions and love lives, they show that life is a bit life caramel: at times sticky, at other times sweet, painful and wrenching. The qualities are alloyed together.Worth seeing!"
2,insubstantial confection,"**1/2Like the confectionary treat that is its namesake, ""Caramel"" is a sweet-tasting concoction that leaves you feeling less satiated than undernourished when it's over. Set in and around a beauty parlor in Beirut, Lebanon, the story chronicles the decidedly low-keyed romantic escapades of a group of women (some of them stylists and others customers at the shop), all of whom fall out into neatly differentiated categories like ""the non-virginal fiance,"" (apparently, that's still a concern in that part of the world), ""the lonely spinster,"" ""the other woman,"" ""the lesbian,"" etc.Within its comparatively restricted genre (let`s just call it the ""hair emporium movie,"" for lack of a better term), ""Caramel"" is less theatrical than ""The Salon,"" but nowhere near as sharp and funny as ""Barbershop"" or ""Steel Magnolias."" The actresses are all competent and appealing, but the material is stretched so thin that the movie barely makes it across the finish line before calling it quits."
2,brush and file,It is not what it appears when looking at pictures. It is Cheap made and probably won't last 6 months.
2,good for a while,"Product arrived as advertised within allotted shipping time and appeared to be of good quality. After 4 months of use, the cable cuts in and out. I finally replaced it with a name brand cable."
4,Decent cable for a good price,"I bought this cable because I wanted the length (25 feet), I thought the red color would be nice, and it was a good price compared to some other shorter cables. The cable turned out to be all black (not red as pictured), but it still seems sturdy and reliable. Decent quality, long length, good price."
1,Very poor quality,"Poor workmanship. Padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5"" long. Most palms are wider than that. The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use. Shipping them back would cost more than they're worth."
4,Nice concertos,"Albinoni's oboe concertos are nice and appealing. I find Albinoni to be good reading music. Melodically lovely and simple in structure, Albinoni produced volumes of very nice baroque concertos. Albinoni's concertos work really good for oboe and Holliger does a good job performing these lovely concertos.Not as sophisticated or profound as the masters of the baroque, Albinoni was never the less a fine craftsman. A night spent listening to Albinoni will not change your life, but it will put a spring in your step and get you humming some nice melodies.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
2,Soo Frustrating...,"Okay, so I bought this for DS and was totally dissapointed. It's so stupid. It takes like 30 minutes to get the cat's happy meter to green by petting it. And sometimes the cat gets mad if you pet it. I do not like this game at all. The house that you live in is ugly and all lol and I just don't like it. Plus, it's confusing and hard. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,Very bad game,"This game was fun when my daughter first tried it, but then it got really boring. She said all you do is sit there petting the animal. All you can really have is the cat pen. But if you want more animals, you will have to spend 30 mins. petting each cat. My daughter was excited to have this game but now she never plays it anymore,"
2,Imagine Animal Doctor,"My Daughter likes the game, but said it is hard for her to play because to many of the animals are sick at the same time. She likes her other imagine games better."
5,Animal Doctor,"Even though I got this game for my daughter, I ended up giving this one a try. It was very cute and I had a lot of fun with it. :D The game arrived quickly and it works great!"
4,First poetry book of Edna St. Vincent Millay,"From high school American Literature I remember four writers that impressed myself and my friends: Edith Wharton, O. Henry, Edgar Lee Masters and Edna St. Vincent Millay. Therefore, I reread Renascence as part of a reading stroll down memory lane - and found again the elegence that impressed us many years ago.Many of these poems deal with grief and death including suicide. But beginning with the near-mystical Renascence there is a confidence in something more. Her skill is best shown in the sonnets, a form she used extensively as it is a near perfect fit for her sensibilities.She is very much a traditional in form and rhyme with much of her imagery being garden and flower. However, there are few times that the syntax becomes awkward or forced in order for her thoughts to fit the form. In short, this is a poetry book worth reading."
1,Satan: DVD Of Mis-Information,"I must confess in regards to the so-called documentary...if mis-information is what you are looking for?! Look no further. From the get go when Lucifer is said to be another name for Satan you can sure bet that single minded Christian antics are at work here.There is so much to gripe about here that I will say this: HOGWASH.Avoid this at all costs and look for more interesting documentaries such as: Satanis, Omen Legacy, Angeli Bianchi-Angeli Neri, Scream Greats Volume 2:Satanism and Satanic Witchcraft, and a really good documentary on the Mondo Macabro release ""Satanico Pandomonium""."
5,Phelge's Stones,"About two years ago I bought ""Phelge's Stones"", it's the only book about the Stones in the early years which tells the real story.. If you want to know who throws fireworks in his own car, you've to read this one :)"
5,Stone's Fan? READ IT!,"The best book about the Rolling Stones ever written!You'll find no socialites, lurid sex with high class women, or tales of perversion(well, maybe some perversion) & drug abuse here. What you will find are the real roots of the Stones by the ultimate insider.Check it out!What would Keith do for a spot of brandy?The origins of Nanker Phelge.The link between Perry Como and Mick Jagger.All this and more in the only Stones book that knows what it's talkin' about. Funny, sweet, gross & heartwarming and still a better read then Keith's Life . Thanks Jimmy!"
5,"Unlike others, he was there","Pheldge was there when it all began and his insight is different than those who werent. His humor shows why they asked him to live there with them and he writes a good book. He doesnt sensationalize, he documents events that took place when the Stones started their incredible musical and personal journey. If you a fan, or a history buff or someone who wants to read about how the greatest rock and roll band got it's start, in true text, this book is for you mate."
4,Best Gay Film I've Seen,"I find a lot of films that are focused on the gay genre to be very trite and unrewarding for the viewer. This was the exception.Saw it at a film fest last year and have been waiting for the DVD to share it with my friends. It's definitely a dark comedy with several laugh out loud moments (and I rarely laugh out loud). They acting is great and the characters are easy to attach to.Overall a very well done film. Were it not for the subtitles I'd give it 5 stars....I mean, who likes to read when you can stare at the guys."
4,"Funny, quirky comedy/thriller (more comedy) worthy of Almodovar fans!","This Spanish film, set in Madrid, is a very dark (and, at times, very funny) comedy set in Madrid, where an unscrupulous real estate agent named Victor decides to start killing off little old ladies in the Chueca neighborhood of Madrid, who refuse to sell their apartments to him, then flips their apartments and sells them to affluent gay couples in the up-and-coming neighborhood. When gay couple Rey and Leo inherit the apartment next to theirs from one of Victor's victims - and Rey decides to move his mother into it, instead of selling it to Victor - things go from bad to worse, in a comedy with some bizarre characters and situations, that somehow is also a lot of fun to watch. Loved it."
4,Very Almodovar-ish,"The title is a compliment! ""Boystown"" is a very good black comedy, style of which reminds me some works of Almodovar.Laughter is mixed with tears, happiness with sadness, comedy with thriller plus a bit of absurd.There are not paper characters in this film. From ""straight-from-hell"" mother-in-law to hypohondric detective and her ""still-in-the-closet"" son. From evil estate agent to cute chubby driving instructor.Very good and very advised to watch."
5,One of my favorites,This movie is funny and endearing. I think the supporting characters are stronger than the main actor--don't let that deter you. The men are loving and real; I bought this movie after having seen it on video and am very pleased with my purchase.
3,engine builders handbook,This would be a good book for a novice engine builder. Good pics and basic engine building knowledge.
2,Engine rebuilding,Very dissappointed in the detail provided on engine rebuilding. I did not learn a single new method or trick for rebuilding.
4,Engine Builder's Handbook,"Having rebuilt three of my own engines over the last year, I was looking for hints and tips to improve my results and to raise my skill level. From the very beginning of the book, Monroe's attention to detail and common sense approach has done just that for me. This book is worth reading by anyone who has an interest in engines and rereading before any engine rebuild. I highly recommend it."
5,Geat starter,"Okay, I've built more than a few engines, but I picked up this book since it's been a while, just to see what's up. But, really, there's only so many things that can change. But if you've never built an engine, this is THE book you have to start with. Mr. Monroe assumes that you know what an engine is, but beyond that everything is explained in detail. Tear down, cleaning, picking parts. There are excellent sidebars on things like calculating compression ratios, how to balance a rotating assembly, lapping valves, etc. If the last sentence only makes a little sense to you, you need to read this book.For me, it's just a little review. But for starters, it's an important book in your library."
3,Length,Way too long had to spend another 15 to get them hemed. Did not even offer me petite for length
3,NEVER AGAIN,Too expensive. I had to shorten them before wearing and still I think they are still too long.I like my other jeans much more than these.(Liz C.)I wear them but won't buy another.
4,Better than expected,Very comfortable fit great. Wore jeans on a plane trip and was still comfortable after several hours traveling and sitting. Still looked good on.
5,Jeans,"I love them. I am going to get another pair of NYDJ jeans, The fit is perfect! The cut,color could not as for better jeans."
3,Even smaller,"This is my 3rd pair of NYDJ jeans, the 3rd different size ordered. This time I went 1 size less than I normally wear. I love the jeans; I think the 4% spandex does it but it does not make my tummy look any flatter. I'm not sure what the ""X"" does but there doesn't seem to any tighter fit in the tummy area than anywhere else. The rest of my body looks good in these jeans but I don't think I'll go for # 4."
3,not tall,The jeans fit great in the hips and stomach. They are too long. I am 5'7'' and not petite. These pants were not sized for the average women. They drag on the ground and will soon fray.
3,"Great fit, strange quality issue","This is my second pair of NYD Jeans (1st pair bought elsewhere), so I bought the same size as previous. The jeans fit great, and I love how they look.The downside is: like most jeans, they have rivets in many places on the seams. Even before I washed the jeans, several of the rivets fell off. Every time I put on the jeans, I find another rivet on the floor. It isn't particularly noticeable, but it does make me wonder if the jeans will last as long. I would have returned them, but I had to have them hemmed in order to wear them.For the dollars involved, I'm a bit disappointed in the quality. I'd probably buy another pair because I like the fit and how they feel, but I'd look over the pair in great detail for quality flaws before wearing, washing, or altering."
4,Nice jeans for middle age!,"These are very nice, extremely comfortable jeans. I have never spent over $40 for a pair of jeans before, but these were worth it. Didn't shrink after being put in washer and dryer, either. I guess I've reached the age and body shape where the cost runs second to fit and comfort :-)"
1,What A Let Down,"I had high hopes for these jeans, but they were dashed on the rocks or reality. I ordered the boot cut jeans in the average length. First of all, the fabric is very thin. Second, the waist is too big, but the thighs are skin-tight. Third, I am 5'6"", but the length of these jeans are made for an Amazon! (ha, ha) Don't waste your money."
2,Way too short,"I had tried on these jeans in a department store so was sure of the fit. However, these size 12 arrived and were way too short. I am 5'5"" and normally don't take a tall. Should be noted that these run short. The rest of the fit was perfect."
2,Not great,Denim is too thin and stretchy. I would not buy this name brand again. I don't like the light wash color either
5,Comfortable,These jeans fit well and are super comfortable. They are a little long at my heels because I wear flats. They look great on and are slimming.
3,Bootcut Jeans,"Product came quickly and when promised. However, I don't like the fit of these jeans and would not order them again. I don't think it is a problem with the product because they were as advertised, I think they were not meant for me."
4,Not your Daughter's jeans,"I really liked the fit of these jeans through the body (although I didn't think they were any better in quality than Gloria Vasnderbilt's jeans) and I would have kept them but they were about 3 inches too long (and I am 5'8"". I didn't want to spend more money to have them hemmed."
1,Jeans are not a true black like the picture shown,"The jeans may be great, but the color ""black"" like the product display picture does not match at all. The jeans are more dark blue in color."
4,"Nice, but.....","I finally broke down and spent the money to buy these. I love the fit and even got a size smaller than I normally buy. The problem for me is that they are way too long and I had to hem them. Apparently they are designed for wearing with high heals which I'm beyond wearing anymore. I would love to have another pair, but hate to have to shorten them. Too much effort based on the price of the jeans."
2,not your daUGHTER'S JEANS,"IN THE PAST i BOUGHT THESE SAME JEANS AND ADORE THEM. buT RECENTLY PURCHASED A NEW PAIR AND FOUND THEM TO BE SOOOO LONG THAT i CAN'T EVEN WEAR THEM.,UNTIL i HAVE A SEAMSTRESS HEMMED THEM UP. fOR 100.00 BUCKS THEY SHOULD FIT AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WASH, DRY HOT, OR HEMM THEM UP TO FIT. WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2,too short,"I read the reviews on these jeans and decided to go for it. I have a hard time buying jeans that are long enough and fit from the crotch to the waist. Jeans are mostly too short and being high waisted most tend to pull up in an unattractive way. Well I took the plunge and plunked out the money. They fit great, up top, and seemed long enough, until I washed them. I never throw jeans in the dryer, and I wash in cold water only, just because of this problem. Guess what? they shrunk. They went from just grazing the floor to my ankle. Being boot-cut just accentuates the too short problem. I was not happy. I should have listened to my internal doubts. If your inseam is 32"" and below this should not be a problem, but for those of us with 33"" and above inseams it is a problem. This is for other women who have long inseams. Do not waste your money. At this price I did not expect to lose that much length. This was a painful and expensive lesson."
5,Terrific Fit & Great Support,I honestly was skeptical about buying these jeans. I decided to go for it and I am so happy I did! I ordered two more pairs because I had them on only for a half an hour & received two compliments on how terrific they look! I highly recommend these to every woman that loves jeans and just wants that bit of support we all hate to admit we need. I cannot praise these jeans enough. I love the color of them. I ordered the dark denim and they are gorgeous! I just want to say thank you for manufacturing jeans for women with curves!! I definately LOVE these jeans and I am going to continue wearing them & telling everyone where to get them!! Thank you once again.
3,NYDJ (Not Your Daughter's Jeans),"I didn't find that these jeans fit any differently than ones I've purchased at JJill except for perhaps the back-end. Maybe I needed a smaller size,but they weren't really worth the expense. Now its one month later and I did purchase another pair two sizes smaller which helped with the curves again on the back end,but there is NO tummy tuck to them that is any different than any other jeans I have.Yes, there is an ""X"" stitched across the front,but don't expect anything from that. The material feels good and washes really well,but I'm still not sure these are worth the ""hype"" nor the price. I think people should check out the reviews for the petite pairs also. Apparently, they also have problems with these jeans."
5,Appropriate,This DVD stand works perfectly and is more than adequate for my collection. It utilizes such small amount of space and I could easily mount it on the wall if I wish. I think I need the sister stand now for my CD collection. I posted a review earlier after my stand was received. I would like to withdraw that review as Ritz Camara had nothing to do with the packaging which I was dissapointed about.
1,the color is BLSCK???!!!,I don't understand why the one sent to my home is BLACK while it looks like RED on the website...i am extremely disappointed!!!
3,"Functional, but poorly constructed","Like others I had more difficulty assembling this item than such an item should require. This was mostly due to the extremely cheap plastic nuts which ship with the item. Metal nuts would have been much easier, and more dependable. I can't believe any company would be so cheap as to provide plastic parts for this product. And the wooden balls that you have to force on to the top of each rack could have been manufacturered better. It's functional, but I don't think I would purchase it again, and especially since I notice it's price has increased 20% in the week since I bought it. It's price should have dropped."
4,DVD holder,"It was like described except the balls were too small to fit the top of the bars but it didn't seem to make a big difference. Overall, it was a good purchase. Need to order couple of more soon!"
1,"Doesn't Hold Advertised Capacity, can't move it, balls do not stay on","I got this via FedEx today. Shipping was incredibly fast as usual with FedEx, but unfortunately that is where the goodness ends. I opened it up and it was much smaller than I expected. I can only hold around 60 DVD's and not the 74 it is supposed to. These are normal DVDs, and not box sets either. It was easy to put together just 4 screws on the bottom which were tricky to get in. You cannot move the stand much because it is hard to when there are DVD's on it. It falls apart at the mid-section where the 2 metal pieces are Jointed together with no clip or anything to hold it in place. The balls on the top for decoration were very hard to put on and some did not fit at all. It is somewhat wobbly but not too bad. I will be returning this product because I am very upset with it. It looks nice, that is about the only thing I can vouch for it."
4,Watch out for falling movies,"The tower looks cool and assembles easily. Be careful how you stack the dvds, though. It is prone to toppling if the movies are unevenly spread."
4,Great style and functionality,"Love the style and function of this DVD tower. Holds a lot of DVD's in a little space. The sections slide apart and DVD's fall off when you try to move it, but once it's in place it's pretty stable."
2,Yeah it holds my PS2 and Wii cases and all that...,"But the construction was a pain in the ass. Maybe I got a botched one. All of the screws didn't screw in - they were too damn loose! They just slid right onto the poles instead of being screwed on, so when I picked it up two of them fell off *snaps fingers* just like that. For something that supposedly costs $100+, I expected better craftmanship. Maybe I'm the odd one out. I look at all these other reviews and see ""assmebly was easy, only took me 15 minutes"" and I can't help but feel irritated that I got the bum one. Whatever. Can't win em all. At least I didn't spend anywhere near $100 on this."
5,Looks great and is reasonably solid and stable!,"I really have no complaints about this.1. I came in the mail quickly.2. I had it put together in about fifteen minutes, and it came with any required tools. The wooden accent balls that go on the top are a little tough to put on, but I like that because it means they won't fall off easily.3. My floor is uneven in my 1916 apartment, but the stand doesn't seem like it's tipping at all.4. It looks nice with all my DVDs and XBOX360 games on it next to the Tv."
5,Nice design,"This item was very easy to put together, it took about 5 minutes. Nice construction and color that matches my decor. I am satisfied with my purchase."
4,Overall a decent stand,"It took about 10 minutes to assemble this stand. I didn't have any problems other reviewers mentioned with the base plastic screws, although the included tool they give you is a little awkward. To install the wooden balls at the top of the stand I HAD to widen the holes; there was just no way they were going to fit over the metal rod any other way. Another reviwer recommended a utility knife which would work fine; I used a cordless drill with a bit just barely larger than the hole already there and that did the job.If you have a box set where the actual box is a a little larger than the dvd case, it will have problems fitting in this stand: my Lord of the Rings box sets fit just fine, but for Star Wars and Indiana Jones I had to actually pull the metal rods apart and force the box set in.Other than those minor issues, the stand serves it's purpose and looks great."
4,Ranch Renovations - Big Time,"My purpose in purchasing the book was to get some idea of the style of ranch home architecture. I really did not get that. It is a very interesting book of ranch style homes that have been transformed by renovation. In many cases even the skeleton of the old house has been changed so much that it gives the appearence of a new species.The photography is of a high quality, and the lay out is nice. It led me to contemplate a range of possibities for my 50 year old rancher."
1,This misses the mark,"This ranch house book includes a little bit of everything and not enough to satisfy individual readers. If you're a purist, you won't find enough in here. (Buy an Eichler book or some other similar book instead.) If you're not a purist and want ideas for redoing a more ordinary ranch house, you won't find enough either. The book is very thin also. It is basically a magazine's worth of stuff for a big book price."
4,Good background on Ranch History,"If you are expecting fabulous photos of amazing retro ranches, then don't get this book. If you want a good history of the ranch and all it's styles, then this is a good book. It is highly edited to represent each of the different styles of ranch homes. No, every ranch wasn't an Eichler style home. Some people still couldn't let go of cape cods and colonials. But it is a lovely book with good information and some good interior decorating styles. Buy it used and ENJOY."
2,An unstylish book,"Although this book has a couple of nice homes in it, the book misses the fun and exuberance of the ranch house trend. I got the feeling that the person who put the book together probably did very good term papers or reports in school. Yes, it is that boring. And most of the photos are too small which is frustrating."
1,I am disappointed in this,"The book sounded good, but it's a sloppy collection of homes without much of a story to tell. It's more of a scrapbook of houses than a real book. Not worth the money I paid."
3,Not the best ranch house book.,"Go with ""Ranches: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling, and Building New""- by M. Caren Connolly, Louis Wasserman if you're looking for a book about ranch homes. The houses in there are a little bit extravagant, but I find they offer more ideas and possibilities. I don't like the way this book is layed out. It tends to jump all over the place."
2,Not enough for the money,"This book wasn't enough for the money. Minus the index, it's 185 pages or so, which makes this a very thin book for the money. I also kept waiting for the author to get to the point. What I mean is that this book came off to me as an OK collection of houses without a strong enough reason for being. I expected more pages, more houses, and more ideas for the money."
3,Not for the ranch house purist,This book is not for someone looking for traditional ideas on decorating or updating a ranch style house. It basically demonstrates how you can incorporate any number of decorating styles into a ranch house.Nice images and layout.
5,Stunning and Informative,"Though it would look lovely on anyone's coffee table, Ranch House Style is more than a ""pretty face."" It contains fascinating information about the Ranch House, meticulously researched and expertly written. Each selected house is a study in taste and originality. The photos are sumptuous and the presentation artful. Well-recommended for anyone with a ranch--and anyone with a coffee table."
5,Ranch House Smile,"Ranch houses rank right up there with mom and apple pie as being purely American -- and Katherine Samon does not preach about them. She sees them as a framework to define us and our diverse tastes. Under the guise of a design book she finds the homegrown charm in our everyday styles -- and sometimes over the top style too (as in ""Elvis Meets Kuwait""). It's fun with good humor and nice photos which document ""real people"" approaches to this genre."
5,One of my favorites!,"Here's why. It opens with Megan reluctantly getting a job as a candy-striper at the hospital where her father works. However,she soon makes friends with a very sick boy named Donovan. He confides in her about a check he receives from the One Last Wish foundation. Can she help him attain his wish in time? My favorite part was when Donovan was cold and Megan climbed into his hospital bed to warm him with her body(trust me,it's not as erotic as it sounds). I wish the book could have ended differently. Otherwise, I totally loved it! If you like this novel,read If I Should Die Before I Wake. The books are somewhat similar and both very great!"
5,Extremely Emotional,This book is one of Lurlene McDaniel's best. It tells us that dreams really can come true and happiness can come from the bleakest of corners. You will get caught up in Meg and Donavan's growing love and cry with them. The story is a heart-wrencher and you will find yourself crying through most of it. You probably won't want to put it down though as there is never a dull moment.
4,life's unfair,"Meg's angry at her father for forcing her sign up as a 'candy stripper' at the hospital for the summmer. After a year, she's still reeling from the sudden death of her best friend. Her parents feel that helping out at the hospital will be a good thing for Meg.At the hospital, Meg almost literally runs into Donnavan. Donnavan was racing a boy ina wheelchair down a hallway in the pediartics wing. Donnavan's 17, and dealing with a failing liver. He doens't let it get him down though.Meg starts to fel drawn to Donnavan, and visits him room often. He comes from a poor home. His single mother and his little brother, Brett, who's 6, don't get to visit him often.Meg starts to care for Donnavan more and more, but she does't want to admit her feelings to him. Donnavan's really sick, and will die within 6 months if he does't get a liver transplant.This story was very good, but there wasn't enough romance. I admit, I'm a sucker for romance. lol"
1,Just does not have it ...,"I bought two books, one by Louis Gary and the other by Sham Tickoo. Both had good reviews. The book by Louis Gary was concise and well presented. The book from Sham Tickoo was NOT!.The book from Louis Gary was out a doubt the best-written introduction book on Pro/E I have ever seen or read. The Pro/Engineer Wildfire Designers book by Sham Tickoo was one of the worst written books I have ever seen or read. Day vs. Night. ... few step-by-step approaches, etc.Sham Tickoo does not cover parametric modeling very well and there are few step-by-step approaches in the book. I would not recommend the book by Sham Tickoo."
3,Pre-publication Review Missing,"Spelling errors, bad grammar, incorrect facts, diagrams not consistent with text. Page xiv tells the reader that you will be learning Autodesk Inventor. Ignoring this, the book may have a lot to offer, but the author should have had an english speaking person review the material."
1,I wish I could rate this book with a zero star rating,"I do not think that Professor Sham Tickoo is writing his own books, but I do think that he is writing his own reviews. I think that he has hired a group of inept people to write his books............I found various command, menu errors alone with spelling errors and VERY bad grammar, ""even for an Engineer"". In his book, he tells the reader that you will be learning Autodesk Inventor. Give me a break. This is NOT a five star book."
4,Yummy!,If you love Greek you'll love Sofi's book....My family loves the creations I've made using her recipe's.
1,So bad,Way to give the unheard bands a chance.This is just a complete pile of mainstream crap.Think of it as giving the rich an extra million dollars.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"WHAT A SCAM.............. MAKING MORE MONEY FROM YOUR FANS FROM MYSPACE. YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE ""FREE"" COPIES TO MYSPACE USERS :)CAN I GET A REFUND???"
5,Soooo underrated,"Yeah it's a ""soft pop"" vibe that was around that era but GOSH, this is a very unique sound and lovely creamy songs. I love gobs of his stuff from 1958-1991 and he's always all over the map and probably eye-rolled when he recorded this but man, this is such a peaceful sexy yum-yum album. This voice is a lot higher toned but my choice gets me highly stoned when this peaceful smoke comes into my ears."
4,Once A Drifter Charlie Rich,This cd makes about the 16th cd that I have of Charlie's. I enjoy it as much as all the others.Edna
2,speakers,"i am done with the pyle experiment the products are cheap poorly made , spend a little more for something else. you get what you pay for"
1,Not my taste.,"These speaker sound thin, have very little mids and no bass. I can think of no good use for these speakers.I guess if a person has only heard music from a Horned record player that only played 78 records...I suppose these speakers would be of some improvement."
3,Buy if u know about drawing,"I found the explinations rather vague.... the book doesn't really explain too well the form in which you have to draw, its good at teaching technique materials requires and stuff, but if you don't already know how to draw its a little hard to learn how to draw good anime from it. I didn't get much from this book... it doesn't give much explination in the actualy WAY you need to draw the head and body. And it gave absolutley no teaching on how to draw the eyes... which is an essential part of the anime style drawing, maybe its to get you to buy the other books??"
2,Seriously?,"I bought this years ago like in 2003 at a local bookstore and it sure as hell wasn't the price that's listed here on Amazon. I don't remember how much it cost me but it was in the $30 range. The kit is more of like a sample of creating your own manga. It came with hardly any screen tones, a few pieces of paper, a couple of pencils, an eraser, a 6in ruler, a curves ruler, a liner pen, the book, and the cheap plastic case.The only good thing about this kit is pretty much the book and the pen. The pen was a decent quality, but not the best. The paper though is good too, but there is hardly any screen tone to really cover up all of the pieces of paper that it comes with. The pencils are nothing special, they're just normal pencils with ""how to draw manga"" printed on them.But all in all, it's a good start if you're wanting to create your own manga.The cons about it is that it's WAY too expensive now. I'm guessing that it's very rare now or something."
1,Disappointed...,"I was highly disappointed in this DVD. There are some cool video shots of the SR-71, but video quality is no better than a VHS dub. Audio commentary could have been muted, you'll learn more from a 5 second scan on Wikipedia."
2,Expensive Look But!,This is a great watch however I bought two so far and both have quickly shown wear by the plating coming off...
2,NOT UNSTOPPABLE,With in 14 months of owning this watch it stopped due to solar chip failure. Fortunately it was under warranty. I treat my watches with a lot of care / stewardship and for this to happen so soon is not good. Then the same thing happened to my Largo eco drive after owning it for 10 months. If they never act up again I will be happy to change my reviews on them. The funny thing is I have a 1st year eco drive that has stayed working now for over 4 years...YAY. It is a plain strait forward time piece with out any of the complications or the perpetual calender features of the other 2 I have. Maybe that difference is why this happened? I hope your experience with these watches is better.
5,Happy Hubby.,This is a beautiful timepiece and my husband loves it. Your price was 50% less than retail in my area. So I love it.
5,Delectable.,"These confections do not dissapoint! Beyond a doubt, Bassets brings you the best...forget all the rest!"
2,"Satisfactory, but could be much better.","The book does a reasonably good job of covering the elementary aspects of using SPSS 10.0 for data analysis. Its primary weakness is the lack of data to duplicate the ample examples provided in the book. The book directs the reader to a web site for download of data. However, the data sets at the web site have changed and the results presented in the book cannot be verified or used for practice (e.g., the ""bodyfat"" data set is now ""fat"" and the data has changed). The book needs to be distributed with a data set. SPSS 10.0, Guide to Data Analysis by Norusis includes a data disk and it is nearly identical in most other aspects of the book. The Carver and Nash book has short sections on nonlinear models, basic forecasting techniques, and the Chi-Square tests not covered in the Norusis book if this is important to the reader."
3,Extended mixes of prodigious Sugar output,"This is material from 12"" vinyl releases and several of the cuts sound like the source material was a vinyl copy that may have been played with a rough needle! It should also be noted that the mixes don't qualify as ""dub"" really - they are more just extended rythms although not unenjoyable. Minott is capable of prodigious output and the quality level on these dancehall releases is remarkably high. Some great lyrics and hooks. This is a highly listenable collection of 12' mixes that otherwise would not have been available. Just a few songs that amount to filler. Sugar Minott -- what a talent!The packaging is unique and nicely glossy with short but useful notation. Moll-Selekta put some money into this release so you or I donpt have to worrry about tracking down a bunch of obscure records. Enjoy!"
5,A MUST For any Dannii Fan!!,"This single is perfect and is a must have for the b-side ""Nervous,"" Dannii's finest track."
1,I wouldn't buy it again!,"I ordered this mp3 player a few months ago, and though it worked fine for a while, it suddenly and for no apparent reason just quit working. It won't charge, won't turn on, and won't reset. I'm very disappointed and upset that I wasted my money on this product."
3,This may be an idea waiting to pop for the average movie buf,"I dont have this product, but I am a fan of Toshiba. I just do not know why you would spend all the money on a six disc changer if only one can play at a time. I think a single dvd player is a much better idea. The other five disc capability is excessive. On the other hand if you are really lazy this may be the product for you."
3,TOO LIMITED,It does a great job on DVD's and CD's...sound and sight.....HOWEVER it can not play CD's that I have recorded from my other CD's.....where I have just my favorite numbers...so I had to purchase another CD player than has that capability........I wanted to save space......and in that it failed........so its 4 stars for performance......and 1 star for other features that were critical such as space-saver
2,Buyer beware,"I actually bought the SD-3109 which is no longer offered. But I thinkthe problems I am having with it warrant a review of how disappointed you will be if there is any problem with your Toshiba DVD. I am having a problem with playing audio CDs. The audio fades in an out when playing a CD. Toshiba said they would either exchange or repair the unit if I would ship it to one of their service centers at my cost...Now I will be out the purchase price and shipping/insurance to fix a unit that was not right in the first place. Just a warning to buyers, make sure to check every function of the product and return it right away before no one wants to stand behind it. I guess you get what you pay for and I should have known better..."
3,Missing One Important Feature,"I purchased this player because of the 6 disc capacity carousel. I assumed I would be able to load 6 audio discs in and play them in random mode. This is not the case with this unit. You can only play one CD in random mode at a time. After this is completed it will switch to the next disc and play that one in random mode. Very annoying if you want to load in six discs and have an afternoon of continuous music. Also, the carousel is very noisy! Not worth the money, keep looking!"
3,mediocre rice cooker,This is a mediocre rice cooker. I always get a bit burned rice at the bottom and simply better not keep rice more than a couple hours. The point is... it's cheap!
2,"Looks nice, burns rice","This little gem looks great on a counter top and was very reasonably priced... but has burned our rice every single time we used it. I read the reviews before I bought it and thought we could ""get it right"", but alas it just does not work well. The metal lid also quickly separated from the plastic overlid -- meaning that when we now try to open the machine, a hot, steamy, often dripping piece of metal comes clattering down from the plastic top.Sadly, I can't recommend this product."
4,Pan Tadeusz,I think it is very interesting book. It tells you how did the live looked like in eastern Europe in 18 and 19 century.
2,Failed after 3 hours use - no response from Viewsonic Service,Purchased from Amazon on 3/15/06. The N3250W failed after only 3 hours of use 4 weeks ago. Picture was good for the 3 working hours. No response from Viewsonic Customer Service.
4,Great TV for the price.,"The new model is even better the N3260. Get it if you can. This tv produces a good picture and has good sound quality, but it only has one HD component input. Also there is only power button on the front of the TV so don't lose the remote. There may be other controls on top but I have a wall mount and can't reach them if they are there. The new model has controls on the lower right.Also this model has a strange mounting bracket and can not be mounted with a square bracket in the center like most flat panels. It seems ok mounted off-center though. Switching sources is more complicated than necessary also. These problems have also been remedied on the new model."
1,"Great LCD TV, great price..BEWARE of ............","Hello, we bought this set for our son, within six months the HDMI input stopped receiving a signal, I called got a rma #,was told it would be two weeks from the time they got it too the time I got it back, great !, sent the set in, called a week after they had signed for the set via Fedex, and it was no where to be found, I was told that sets only get put into the computer system when they are worked on, so it's there a week and not even looked at yet, I ask how soon we can expect it and am told that it will be a minimum of fourteen work days and then be shipped via UPS ground service, so add another week(roughly six weeks from the time we shipped it!!!), and the rep's response to my being upset??? That's just how it works. Do yourself a favor, stay away from Viewsonic products, you may never need customer service, but if you do...."
1,Do not buy this unit,"I have owned this unit for almost 2 years. In the last year it has had many problems. At this point it does not respond at all. I will be throwing it out. Do not buy Viewsonic products, they are junk."
2,Sound problems,"I bought this brand new and had a problem with the sound the moment it was hooked up to the cable. The volume would turn itself off and the cable technician said it's definitely a problem with the tv. As the tv 'warmed' up, the sound became stable,but the next day when I turned the tv on, there was a loud, crackling noise...like how old tv's used to sound when they have to warm up. I will be returning this tv before my 30 days are up. I recommend not buying this TV even though the picture is actually very good. Though the price was the big draw for me, it's not worth all the trouble. Save yourself any headaches and stay away from Viewsonic's tvs."
1,Wont turn on after 2 years...,"I bought this item Feb 2006. The unit will just turn off by itself. So it was replaced.Viewsonic support was bad when I had to deal with them.Anyways, no problem with the replacement when it came.Now, 2 years passed. One night the tv's display went upside down. I couldnt figure what went wrong, so I just clicked the MEMORY RECALL from the menu, and it started to show in the correct orientation. After 2 days, the thing wont turn on. The green light will go on for 5 seconds. Then it goes off. Its pretty unusable now."
1,No repair service available,"Tried to contact View Sonic to have LCD TV repaired and was told by ""customer service"" that if the item was out of warranty they do not repair them at all, and there was no way that I could find someone locally to try to repair it."
3,not for a beginner,"A handy book that requires some pre-German knowledge. Treat it like a dictionary. You don't read this book cover to cover. Instead, use it like a reference tool. If you're looking for a great cover to cover Intro to German grammar book try: German Demystified by Ed Swick"
4,Pretty Good :),"The author assumes that you know what certain things mean (declining an adjective, dative nouns, etc) which makes it a bit difficult for someone like me who doesn't remember the little sentence structure/parts of speech that I WAS taught in high school.BUT: the book is still VERY useful, going over pronouns, multi-gendered nouns (as in many languages, German assigns masculine, feminine, or neuter articles to a noun)--nouns that have more than one gender article, which changes the meaning, and pronunciations (my favorite section thus far).DEFINITELY worth the price if you're learning German!"
5,love it,"This seems like a good book to have to help learn German. I've opened it twice, and learned two things."
2,You get what you pay for,"I used them for my back surround speakers, but not for long. They just weren't up to the task. They lack clarity and frequency response is rather limited, thanks to the 3.5"" driver. They're OK if you really can't accomodate anything larger, but overall I'd say they're a waste of money."
4,Far better than typical computer speakers,"For years I've been suffering as I tried to listen to music through cheap, self-powered computer speakers. Nothing I tried was much good. With my setup I have room for a re-purposed Technics 100W receiver, but no good place for speakers, which really have to fit up on the windowsill. My little Polk Audio bookshelfs -- an even better value -- just don't fit. So I went looking for something smaller, but still high quality, for under $75. Well, there ain't much. This was about it. Fortunately, it's working out very well. Smooth, full sound. Decent bass. Really better than I'd expected for the size. It's an acoustic suspension design (not ported), so it's not particularly efficient. I'd suggest 50W per channel if you want solid bass. Overall, I'm much happier now, whether listening to local FM, Internet radio or I-tunes."
4,great for their size,"I sold BIC speakers back in the ealry 90's when they first brought back the brand, the owner of the company came to our store and trained us on the speakers. I must say i have always been a fan of the brand, they have great sound at a decent price. I got my parents a set of BIC speakers about 17 years ago and they still sound great, so when i seen Amazon had these i had to have them.I must say these speakers sound very good for their size, just don't expect a lot of bass from a 3.5"" woofer. I did need to add stick-on rubber feet to take care of a weeble wobble affect since the bottom isn't totally flat. I would recommend going with the next size up if you need ""big sound"" and have the space."
5,Impressive Value,"I caught the Tripath mini-amp bug (Lepai, Indeed) a few weeks ago and since then I've been searching for the perfect speakers to pair with the Lepai for a budget computer/.mp3 player/portable/etc. setup. The search is over! These little bricks aren't much to look at but can they play! The sound is tight, accurate, and they throw that great mini monitor soundstage with fantastic imaging.With a budget mini sub, you could have a very musical little 2.1 system. I have a Cambridge Soundworks Ensemble III running off the Indeed and I have to say, these are right up there with them. On the other side, they put the Dayton B652's to absolute shame. Remember these aren't ported but with some power and/or eq'ing at low levels, you'll be surprised. Great value, well built, heavy, high-density polymer cabinets, rubber surrounds on the woofers, great overall. I'll have these for a very, very long time."
5,Small But Big Sound and Good Power,"Tengo varios años usando la marca Bic Ventury, desde que la fabricaban solo en Inglaterra, luego que las vi en EUA, las he seguido utilizando y siempre han mantenido una excelente calidad, aunque su fabricacion sea china, su repuesta de calidad-precio las hacen una de las mejores opciones del mercado.Sin dudas seguire comprando esta gran marca de bocinas."
4,"LADY'S, THIS IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN!",THIS BOOK WAS GOOD! IT TOLD THE STORY OF WHAT WOMEN GET OUT OF MESSING WITH MARRIED MEN! LADY'S JUST BE AWARE THAT THINGS DONE IN THE DARK WILL COME TO LIGHT AND IT CAN BE A PROBLEM! I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND HAD A REAL GOOD LAUGH AT THE END. THIS IS A MUST READ!
2,Preposterous and just plain silly,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Marissa is not a very sympathetic character, and her brushes with death are merely laughable. The twist at the end is interesting, but it's too little, too late. I will never read this again."
4,not overboard on sex,"I enjoyed this book because readers are left to imagine what Marissa's sexual encounters were like. Nothing's worse than reading a book that abruptly stops to describe sex in contrived, Harlequin-like terms. Boring! It was much more interesting to imagine her with her different men. And since I am a married woman, it pleases me to see an unhappy ending to a story about woman who sleeps with married men. Ms. Mallette is a good author who progresses the story along and the surprise ending threw me for a loop. At first, I thought the stalker was a secretly-jealous Brandon, but I never expected this stalker. I am glad girlfriend didn't walk down that aisle!"
4,It's Worth Reading,"I read this book a couple of months ago. It is about a female that makes herself belive that she only needs to be involved with married men. She belived that she was getting the big end of the stick by getting the sex and money without the commitment and trouble of maintaining a relationship. I personally believe that people that tell themselves that are lieing to themselves, because everybody wants somebody. Has she finally messed with the wrong woman's man? Does she change her ways? Read and find out. This is a pretty good book."
5,Shades of Jade,I could not put this book down! I especially loved the fact that this book had me on the edge of my seat wanting to know who was stalking the main character. Would love to read this book for a book club assignment.
3,TOO HOT TO TROT MARISSA,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK BUT WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED WHEN I FOUND OUT THE PERSON WAS. THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE COME WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT. IT HELD MY ATTENTION UP UNTIL THEN. I STARTED LAUGHING WHEN I DISCOVERED WHO IT WAS. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ THIS, THE PERSON COULDN'T HAVE ACTUALLY KNOWN WHERE MARISSA WAS BECAUSE HER ""FRIEND"" DIDN'T KNOW ALL OF THE TIME EITHER. THINK ABOUT IT. WOMEN LIKE MARISSA DESERVES WHAT SHE GOT. THAT WAS HER CHOICE AND SHE HAD TO REAP THE CONSEQUENCES. FOR THOSE WOMEN THAT ACT LIKE THAT, GROW UP AND GET YOUR OWN MAN."
4,Could have been a bit better,"I really did enjoy this book. It taught me a lot about life and really allowed me to realize that people in fact trully don't know who they're living with. Even though you see someone one way deep within themselves they may be want to be totally different. I think the book wasn't so good in giving suspense. Yes, it did give detail and described things very well, but I feel that the author could have done better in leaving people with awe. I don't feel you should have to get to the 20th chapter and then start to really get deep into the book. But don't get me wrong the book was still very good and I recommend all who can to read it especially those living a double life because like R. Kelly said in his song ""It aint right"""
3,Shades of Jade,"I was surprised at the glowing views offered for this book. Although it held my interest and I did not guess the identify of the culprit, it could hardly be considered a good mystery. The writer is high on teaching and low on plot and detail. The main character is not likeable. Even when she sees the error of her ways; you are not swayed to her support. The author's efforts to teach a lesson about the perils of dating married men are heavy, but plot and character development are light. Much of what occurs is predictable. The only surprise in the book was the culprit and even that lacked creditability. It is obvious that the alleged mystery in this book was the vehicle to teach a morality lesson. I would read the works of this writer again. I would only hope for less of a morality twist and more suspense twists."
2,Just Okay....,"The only interesting thing in this book was finding out who ""the stalker"" was. To be honest, I knew who it was immediately. One little detail gave it away. After that, the only reason to read anything else is to see if your suspicions are correct."
4,Great Read,This is the type of book that will make you think twice about the things that you do in your life that can and will impact others.
5,A true pageturner!,"I'm not usually a fan of mystery/suspense novels, but when I read the back cover of this book I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad that I did! ""Shades of Jade"" is a well-written, suspenseful story. Marissa is a thirty-something, successful single woman who prides herself on selectively dating only professional, moneyed, married men. Although her best friend tries to get Marissa to see the error of her ways, the real wake call begins when Marissa starts to receive threatening phone calls, letters and...well, you'll have to read it to find out....If you're a fan of light mystery, you'll more than likely enjoy this book. And even if you aren't, give it a try anyway. I think you'll find Gloria Malette a talented storyteller."
4,Compulsively Good,This was my first read by this author and it led me to read more of her books. I was taken in by the fresh twist on the relationship theme and the suspense and thrills was an added bonus. Different flavor for a very familiar theme. I enjoyed it.
3,OK I Guess??????????????????????????????????,"This book had a good message, however it took me awhile to finish. It was boring. It talked about phone calls, stalking and harassing. It was a very slow read. If you want to read something by this author read HONEYWELL! Jumps off from the prolugue!"
3,JUST OKAY,"I like what this book was about, but some things were really predictable. Therefore I thought it was okay, could have been better.Marissa was something else, she needed to get her ass kicked, sleeping with married men.Just nasty. However, that's what made the book interesting and different."
5,Well thought out and Well Written,I think this author is very good at putting you right there with her characters. I can easily visualize what is going on when Gloria Mallette writes..that is a true gift of a talented writer. I liked the book and the theme was right-on.
4,It's Cooler In The Shade,"Wow!! I was truly impressed and entertained. The charactes were well-developed and realistic. In books like this, by the 15th page I've more or less figured out the idea, but not this time around. Very well crafted writing."
1,Mindless!,"Have you ever read a book and wondered why? Well, this was mine. Stalker, underlying mysery, weddings, secrets, lies...dumb book. For a minute, I even thought I was reading one of Zane's novels."
1,Unbelievably Horrible,"There are no words to describe how on earth this novel was published by Random House. The writing was horrific; even the dialogue was grammar-school. As a matter of fact, the entire book was written amateurishly. I certainly do not concur that this book is a five star novel -- by no stretch of the imagination. I am embarrassed for the author. Unfortunately, I could not finish reading this book, but I did skip to read the ending and it did not surprise me."
2,Blacksheep Review,"The book was a slow read. It was a hard getting through the book. The book was predictable. Overall, I did not enjoyed this book."
5,Dr. Karl Richter has it,"Dr. Richter is and has always been the foremost, precious, interpreter of J. S. Bach's masterpieces. This recording is no exception. This is my humble opinion; afterall, it is a music masterpiece and a true work of art. But I have several recordings of this mass, and still find Dr. Richter to be what speaks to me."
5,Fine Bach from Karl Richter,"Richter's Mass in B minor steers a middle course between the light-as-a-feather performances by modern HIP conductors like Gardiner and the bloated, elephantine interpretations by Klemperer and Karajan. Unlike the HIPsters, Richter finds a great deal of majesty and spirituality in Bach's great masterpiece, and unlike the traditionalists never lets things bog down. Richter's choir and soloists are excellent, and the orchestra is mercifully free of the screechy violins and undernourished winds that we've learned to expert from HIP recordings. The only weak point of this recording is the trumpets, which as typical with Ricther's Bach recordings are about a hundred times too loud. (No, I am not exaggerating.) At numerous points, they overwhelm the rest of the orchetra. That fault is nevertheless is not enough to stop me from giving five stars to this disc."
1,Disappointing! Merely a miniature decorative book,"This book merely provided a pictorial overview of different kinds of scarves. Some of the photos were lovely, and the book is attractive, although since it is only slightly larger than a deck of cards it doesn't offer much in the way of a coffee table book. The book also does not explain to the reader how to style the scarves in the fashions illustrated, and also is not particularly comprehensive. Useful if you need laundry instructions for your scarf collection."
2,A nice book to leaf through...,"....but not quite worth full price.There's not much to this book. The quotes and historical tidbits are interesting, to be sure, and the pictures are rather lovely. The laundry tips are nice, and the author does give a few more uses for scarves than I would have thought of, but there's nothing in here that you can't find elsewhere, for much less.My advice is to get it at the library, take down what information you need at home -there's not much- and spend the money you saved on a scarf."
4,Sodom - 'Persecution Mania' (SPV),"Probably one of the planet's unholiest bands,that for sure.Didn't even know until recently that these scream-until-you're-dead black metal merchants were even still together.This CD is the band's second effort and maybe one of their best to date.Tracks that about made my wall clock fall were ""Nuclear Winter"",""Outbreak Of Evil"",their Motorhead cover ""Iron Fist"",""My Atonement"" and ""The Conqueror"".Line-up:Angel Ripper-bass&vocals,Aggressor-guitar&vocals and Witch Hunter-drums.I'm assuming these aren't their REAL names.Should appeal to fans of Forbidden,Exodus,Onslaught,S.O.D. and King Diamond."
5,Azden Cam-3 works,"It does just what I need it to do which is balance two microphones. It does not amplify the weaker, but lets me control the one that is always too strong."
3,azden cam mixer,"If you are wondering what or how to use this check out my youtube post on it. Netcommercial is my page, the Title to find it is; Azden Cam-3 mixer.Works fine. As stated by other's, it is not an amplifier, just a pass through for multi mics. 3 in's and one out.Make sure you use the right, decent cables to reduce any static or Hiss, as complained about. It is not a pro mixer but will work in a pinch for 50 bucks. Like, if you are Lapeling two people and one is dominant over the other. this will allow you to bring down the dominant.Not for boosting a soft spoken person. You will need to catch that in editing. Yet, if both are at the same level at shooting, it makes it easier to crank up the whole track in editing, then trying to do it on the ""fly""I did try it with using an Azden Lapel and an Azden shotgun. There is obvious pick up diff for the different caliber mics. Yet as stated if you are using a couple of Lapels of the same make you will find it a handy goodie in the bag."
2,Not so great if your microphones aren't sending a strong audio signal,"I bought this mixer in the hope that I could start using some of my mono mics with my Kodak Zi8, and it did not turn out so great. I plugged in my Audio-Technica ATR35 in the 3rd hole (the one that take any audio feed and turns it into a stereo one), and the result was sub-par. Sure, the recorded sound was in stereo, but a fair amount of static white noise was also added in comparison with plugging the mic directly in and getting audio only on the left channel.I ended up having to clean up the audio anyway."
1,can't hear anything from it!,"I bought it ... hooked a seinheinser MKE-300 mike into it, and plugged it into a SONY TRV-33 camcorder ... and I can't hear much of a sound (very very very very weak sound) even at the max range of the audio channel. Completely fails."
3,azden cam,"Haven't even got to use the mixer yet. As I ordered it as the 'additional items' to go with the lapel mics. Unfortuantly I thought I was getting to mics with the thing that I ordered, and it only came with one. Therefore, no use for the mixer yet. It seems very light. Needs to be attached to the camcorder, but it has a clip on it that you can clip to the strap on your camera, that seems nice. However it's pretty cheap plastic and might have potential to break quickly."
4,Happy to find the original!,"We all had a lot of fun with Magna Doodle when my kids were little but they were a bit tough on it and it got dents in the screen which made it difficult to draw on afterwards. The great thing about it is the built-in impermanence of your drawing loosens you up and frees you to be more creative because if you don't like it you can just make it disappear. It's a nice tool for anyone who wants a simple tool for freeing up the creative thought process. Of course, you can't do highly detailed drawings but it is a good warm-up exercise before more serious pencil and paper planning. And of course, kids love it. I was really psyched to find something as close to the original as this. It was under the Christmas tree as a family present and now hangs over the phone table for anyone to use."
5,Great Winter Wipers,Have used these for the past 6 or 7 winters. On my cars anyway they install without an adapter. I wish the instructions were clearer. The pictures don't show exactly how to disconnect the blade latch. You have to mess around until you get it right. They have better instructions in PDF form on their website but they still fall short. I take a few notes so I can change the blades out faster. I run summer blades spring thru fall & these blades in the winter. I usually run them for two winters before replacing them. Since the summers are hot & dry here I usually only try for one year on the summer blades. They are Ancos too.
2,Shocked!,"I was extremely surprised. In ""It's My America Too""; Ferguson quotes people from Britney Spears to Ronald Reagan and also offers statistics with absolutely no footnotes, bibliography, or index! He makes bold claims about everything from obesity to sports to Hilary Clinton and to our youth-obsessed culture with nothing to back him up.It is simply a book of one college kid's ideas; which is fine, just don't look to it for direction to turn our nation around."
2,Nothing Original,"Ben Ferguson has emerged as one of the newest conservative talk radio hosts and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he is able to draw attention to himself in an already saturated field largely due to a gimmick: in a demographic which is heavily liberal and left of center, he has come off as a strong voice in favor of the right. This is, however, more than a little self-serving for his entire political projection is predicated upon the fact that his views are important and relevant because he is just a young, ""average guy"" and as such is just like everyone else in the under 30 demographic. However, the fact that he butresses such neocon issues as school prayer (and never attended public school), gun ownership (despite never mentioning a single statistic), and supports the war in Iraq (though apparently not so much that he's ready to volunteer for duty quite yet) is more than enough to offset such supposedly ""fresh"" and novel ideas as informed criticism of the republican party."
1,"Ferguson: Too young to know, too stupid to care","Reading this book is to pick up what Howard Stern famously called ""idiot-savant pearls of wisdom."" Except in young Ferguson's case, it's flecks of chicken McNugget on some idiot's sweater vest."
1,This individual is not the voice for America's youth!,"His show, this book, and after seeing him on CNN, on Larry King Live, pretty much having his ass handed to him, they should cancel his show and remove this book from stores immediately!!! This person is so full of sh#*t!!"
1,Chickenhawk?,Ben feels that playing on the yankees is just like being in Iraq and that he can support both without wearing a uniform of either.Ben - you are only young once. You will never have another chance to put your fat ass on the line for your country. Why aren't you there?

1,I want to feel important too,"didn't find anything new in this booksame old stubbornnesshowever, could blame only myself for spending money on itwhat else did I expect?"
3,"Oh, To Be Young Again!","This kid in Memphis, Tennessee, thinks he's all grown up and knows everything there is to know about politics. My, but he is in for a rude awakening. He has a talk show, but could take lessons from Dr. Mark Harmond to be professional in that field.He promotes sixteen-yr.-olds being able to vote! This country would really be in a mess if that happened. He says he is a conservative, but the averages are that he will change his mind when he is all grown up. I know someone who also is in the media who is 47, almost 48 years old, and thinks like a 20-yr-old and balks when someone older than he put a word in sideways. The youth of today will not ever grow up. They stagnate in their own egotistical views which are always right and no one with a different viewpoint can ever change his mind.I hope Ben Ferguson has a successful political life but, the way he is going about it all the wrong way, it is doubtful.He looks clean cut, but looks can be deceiving."
1,Cyberbride,"Don't but this book. There were very few helpful things in here. Buy the Bridal Bargains book and you'll get all of the same information, plus some actually helpful things."
4,nicely made,"This item is very nicely made. I was pleased with its weight and size. The only thing I didn't like was the way the handles turned...both go in the same direction rather than turning to each other, but I am getting used to that. I installed this faucet on my pedestal sink and can't imagine another faucet that would of looked better."
5,nice,"Just got it in today, great color, good size, and good price. I'm liking it even more in person, also I ordered 2 posters from the same vendor, and they were able to roll them up together in one tube. Smart. That's what I'm talkin bout!"
3,Olympia - Emergencies,"The only LP from this band was something you can listen to numerous times, yet after hearing the original demos I was expecting a bit more. I'd really give it a 3 1/2 stars if I was aloud. Five stars of course being that rare amazing cd start to finish"
4,Evocative poetry,"In poetry and illustrations, the reader is on board a ship bound for New England in the seventeenth century. The journey is difficult - ""Tainted water, / Slimy vats. / Wormy biscuits, / Lice and rats."" Finally they arrive in Plimoth - ""One room cabin, / Rush beds, soft. / Greased cloth windows, / Ladder, loft."" The story is told very simply while the illustrations allow the reader to ponder the journey and understand both the hardships and the reward at the end."
4,Bourdain was right about this book.......,"....it's porn for cooks! The vivid and colourful descriptions are absolutely mind-blowing. My only advice to someone thinking about reading this is that unless you really know your stuff, you might want to have a copy of Larousse handy, as there are quite a few references to things that the average reader may not understand or know about."
3,"Interesting, but drags.",The introduction by Anthony Bourdain is a very interesting read. The novel is not so interesting. It moves slowly and is a difficult read.
2,Eh. Hard to get through and not so clever as it thinks,"Interesting in a sort of historical way, but even to me (a food-literature junkie) it was a chore to finish."
4,Intriguingly Intelligent,"""The Truth About Angels"" is an intriguingly intelligent film that dealswith the price a man is willing to pay for the adventurous trappings ofthe self indulgent world of Hollywood and the memories it leavesbehind. With her directorial debut first time feature film writer-directorLichelli Lazar-Lea does a great job of blending the often conflicting worldsof fantasy, reality, infidelity and responsibility together in this unique thoughtprovoking thriller. Lichelli delivers an emotionally honest film that offers themovie goers a point-of-view seldom seen by those outside of the hollywoodentertainment industry. The acting performances of Simon Rex, Antonio Del Preteand the beautiful Dree Hemingway are great. This is a film definitely worth seeing!"
3,Okay,"Ok read. I remember Polly being so sweet,even though she was pressured into the marriage. Not many girls her age can be such a simpleton :D.....still, it was nice when she fell in love."
5,See Florida at its Natural Best,"""For 20 years Moran has traveled the Sunshine State with his cameras, capturing natural Florida as it must have appeared to Ponce de Leon and other early strangers in paradise. Narrating a slide show of his remarkable collection of landscape photography, Moran reflects on his quest to capture the soul of one of the most photographed states in the country."" (review from the Florida Humanities Council)Before moving to Florida, I only had a vague idea of its natural landscape gleaned from television documentaries on the Everglades. This book brings the wide range of Florida natural beauty into our living room. Enjoy!"
4,God's Words are Powerful Tools of Change,"Although I do not consider myself a ""true"" Christian in that sense, reading this book filled me at once with thankfulness, inspiration, and fulfillment of God. Various biblical quotes are conveniently categorized for you, from subjects such as Faith to Forgiveness. Each heading has at least a page of quotes to bring you closer to God's meaning and intentions for those subjects. At such a modest price, I suggest you keep one book tucked away for personal guidance and buy another one for a friend who needs spiritual lifting."
4,A Treasure Trove of God's word,"This book sits right on my desk and I reach for it to provide much encouragement and timely motivation. The words within are indeed ""more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb."" (Psalm 19:10)Got my as a gift and would recommends it as a gift.Thanks, my buddy, for this book."
4,beautiful story,"As an adult now in my 20's, I am not ashamed to say that unicorns still capture my imagination. This short sticker book is a wonderful way to get in touch with that imaginative side while looking at colorful illustrations and reading a beautiful story."
5,Sheets fit for a queen,I bought this sheet set because I wanted white sheets and the price was very good. When I received the set I was very nicely surprised. The quality was better than I had imagined. The design is really beautiful and this is a set for when you want to treat yourself to something special.You will be delighted by the softness and beauty of it. I highly recommend it.
3,New Material,This seems to be the only recently published book for A+. No mention is made as to if it contains the 2003 test material. Any idea?
4,Nice speaker for the size and price,"I was having some issues with the center sound on my system, I didn't know if it was the speaker or the system. I went the cheap route and tried a new speaker first, and mainly chose this because of it's low price, but was then surprised on it's great rating. As it turns out, I made the right choice, the issue was with the old speaker. This one sounds fine and it's nice and small, easy to place in front of the TV. If you need a smaller sized center speaker, don't be afraid of this low price, it still sounds good."
3,Good for the money,I use this in a small room so it works fine. Wish it had a little more high end response. But for the money it works great.
1,Sounded awful.,"This is what I get for trying to economize. This speaker sounded harsh and nasal, like someone talking through a box. I returned it and got screwed on the return shipping. Definitely not recommended."
4,Great speaker for the price,"Overall I think this speaker is fantastic for the price. It's not the best center channel I've ever heard, and it's not the loudest. But, it's pretty good at everything. For my system, my left and right channels overpower this center channel in dramatic fashion. Even after tweaking for quite some time and finding some balance, it's still not powerful enough to keep up. However, I'm really being picky. I would definitely recommend this to anyone piecing together a home surround system."
4,Decent inexpensive speaker,"Let me first start by saying that this is by no means a top-notch speaker. The sound isn't nearly as crisp as more expensive units and it does occasionally sound a little tinny. All that being said, this is a great speaker for the price. The speaker is substantial and while it does take up some space, it's not going to get knocked around if something brushes against it. It performs well, even at elevated volumes, though it's not going to melt your face, either. This is an excellent deal - a no-frills center speaker that works well in a small room or apartment setting for less than $50 is great. If you have a ""home theater in a box"" and are looking to slowly replace components, this is a great place to start."
4,DIY LRF118 / LR1A,"This is an awesome product! It took a little under two hours to install. The instructions were thorough. Several things to bear in mind before taking on this easy install: THINK about where this will be installed (since you are cutting into the drywall - ends up being a permanent placement for the monitor)..have enough LIGHT in the area where you are installing...once you get that monitor up and into the mount, it quickly and effectively blocks light...and last....ALWAYS have a second person. While almost the entire install was a one person job, the lifting of the monitor with attached arm becomes quite heavy."
5,A Must-Have for People Who Like to Have Company,"This is the book I turn to for help in what to fix for what occasion. At the end of every recipe is a chart answering When to Fix It, How Far Ahead Can I Make This?Shortcuts? What to Serve With It? Sides? Desserts, etc? Oh, m' gosh. I use this book more than any other I have collected. If you're a serious cook, buy this book. You won't regret it. Every recipe has been excellent with Anderson's well-worded directions and suggestions."
5,A highly recommended pick for any regular hostess,"When entertaining, it's important to have a cache of tried-and-tested dishes which are simple yet foolproof: Pam Anderson shares nearly 200 convenient dishes in Perfect Recipes For Having People Over, filled with dishes which lend to both make-ahead preparation and crowd-pleasers. From Easy Savory Strata to Perfect Roast Chicken with Several Sauces and Quesadillas for a Crowd, this is a highly recommended pick for any regular hostess."
5,LOVE THIS COOKBOOK!,This is one of my favorite cookbooks I own. I have had success with every recipe I have tried so far. The menu suggestions are great. She even gives suggestions for leftovers! LOVE IT!
5,this is the best.,"I am not a good cook. My family thinks dinner is done when the smoke detector goes off. So, if i can make a great meal from these recipes than anyone can do it. I am no longer afraid to ask people over for dinner."
1,Not recommended,"There is very little actual information in the book. My 4 year old wants to know WHY, HOW, WHEN, WHERE for everything... this book is very short and has very simple drawings. Did not meet our needs."
2,Not for Beginners,I found this book very hard to follow. In order to find out how to do anything you have to pretty much read the entire book and do the exercises. I was hoping I could use it as more of a reference guide. I learned more from the sample document at the beginning than anything else in the book. I would not recommend buying this book.
5,good book for latex,"This is a good book for learning Latex or even if you already know Latex is a good guide for any question about it, ths edition fix some bugs of previous editions, and is a very good material that you can use."
3,Poor introduction and a so-so reference,"As many reviewers have noted, this book is a poor choice for those seeking an introduction to LaTeX. However, I find that I rarely use it as a reference either; it often takes me much longer to find information in this book than on the internet. The index is horribly designed, using the same index for concepts and commands. Finding something in this book feels like finding something in code."

5,A mesmerizing player!,"Sigfried Behrend is a remarkable guitarist. He possesses a very clean phrasing, notable fingering and engaging tune. His version about Aranjuez Concerto is one of the most honest and captivating that I have ever heard.On the other hand, we have to Nicanor Zabaleta, undeniably, the most prominent harpist of the last Century.Recommended without reserves."
3,Review of Shaping Information,"Shaping Information has good content; however, the layout of the book detracts from readability. The leading and font size are off. Also, the figures are shown pages after their in-text callouts, so the reader must flip back and forth between figures and text."
1,Water RESISTANT radio shield,"When I first opened this I thought, WOW heavy and big.... Then I opened the package.What a let down.1st the cover doesn't have enough spring pressure to hold the door open more than about 1/2 inch so to tune the radio youll have to hold the cover up.2nd there is a wonderful seal that is supposed to stop water when the cover is closed. On the one I received that seal ends up with a 1/16 inch gap between the seal and the sealing suface around the circumferance.Quick review I sent it back. Amazon wont let you do a No Star review."
2,Great for the ocassional splash but thats about it!,"It is what you are paying for. Although the hinge quality seemed fairly good, and the appearance is just fine, the hatch seal is poor at best and might with stand a splash now and again. There is a visible air gap between the door and the flange. How much do you like your stereo? I would just pay the extra and get the Pioneer."
4,Radio Shield,"Protection, man, that's what your boating radio needs. Just not cool to walk on-board one day and the dang thing is fried to a crisp by sun and water. Nature may be beautiful, but she sure isn't easy on electronics. This shield is a perfect fit for my boat, flipping out of the way when in use, down for protection. Stupendous!"
3,This product is large,I am unable to use because the surround it too large for my application. Make sure you have the available space to mount. i gave it away.
3,Very big,Very big and the sealant isn't efficient. The sealant needs to more efective to seal and avoid the wather .
3,no mounting hardware,"I ordered this type of cover because I did not want to make the hole in the dash any larger. This cover did not require the opening to be widened. It also provided a finished look to the installation, and you can see the radio clock through the smoked cover when closed.Unfortunatly, I had to file the opening in th ecover to fit the radio. Also, you would expect it to come with mounting screws. It would be nice if it had come with some instructions. For example, you can't just place it over the radio already mounted. You have to put the mounting bracket of the radio through the opening in the cover. ( thus the need to file) otherwise the radio trim would not fit.But it does the job for the cost."
2,"Looks Good, Not the best Protection",I bought this item to seal the faceplate of an outdoor kitchen mounted radio. I have replace the radio 2 times now. I bought marine radios hoping to help them survive. Not so great.
3,so-so,"First be aware that the description/pic is inaccurate in 2 ways : 1) pic makes it look like this has a faceplate for ""two shaft"" radios - it does not. 2) The stated ""support shelf in rear for radio"" does not exist (it even says this on the box??). Its just a faceplate with a cover - no rear to it at all.As far a quality, it seems ok, except the cover seems to pop open way to easy"
1,Not worth the $10 Bucks!,"I bought this to replace a broken one that had already been installed in a Jeep I bought. Right out of box it would not latch, unless I held the cover and frame together right at the latch. Installed, no matter how I tried, it would not latch. This item is definitely inexpensive, but too cheap to even work right out of the box!"
4,picture deceiving,the picture showed a front bracket for a 2 dial radio style instead of a DIN style which I actually have and needed. I thought I'd have to modify the inside faceplate but it was a DIN style already.
2,cover,"This looks ok, not really practical, I am trying to put this on my motorcycle but it is bulky, the sping is weak, and no hardware provided"
2,I don't like it,"I bought the movie because I am a fan of Alyssa Milano. The movie was ok, but I thought she could have done better"
5,nice,These Jerzees 8 oz. NuBlend 50/50 Sweatpants are comfortable sweatpants and appear to be durable. It would be nicer if they had pockets.
3,Decent,"These are cheap, and effective. I bought several pair for the purpose of cutting off one pant leg, as I have a broken leg and wanted some cheap pants to get my cast through easily. These have been perfect, and comfy too. They definitely are not as breathable as 100% cotton, but for 6 weeks they'll do the trick."
2,warmup pants,"would not recommend this productnot comfortable,less flexible than other similar productsno pocketswould not buy these pants again"
2,No pockets,"It did not have pockets. I just assumed it did, but I guess it is my fault for not asking."
1,could be for a woman that is overweight.,"Good quality, however not for a small woman. Gave this item to the poor.A small man or overweight woman will appreciate this item."
1,Jerzees 50/50 Sweatpants,"I had return both pairs of the sweatpants, as they do not have pockets that I need. The Internet ad indicated that they had pockets. They do not. Overall, I am pleased with things that I buy at Amazon but not these sweatpants."
3,black jerzees,"The fit and comfort is fine. A little disappointed with the wear of it. After just one wearing, I'm seeing the pilling (cloth balls) on the backside and between the legs."
3,Disappointed,"They will do. These sweatpants are thinner than I expected and thinner than any other sweatpants I've ever bought. I ordered 2 pair of the same size, one pair fit and the other was too small. I will keep them because it is not worth the time to return them."
3,sweatpants,i ordered 4 pair-some were thin and some were nice. don't think i would order again-guess i didn't read enough about them
4,very nice pair of sweats,"I have a 34' inch waist and am 5'9"" tall these are an excellent fit they are a slim fit too which is great if you are working out and active. they are very soft inside and out which is god for lounging around too! I do not know about shrinkage they were bought for christmas and I have not put them in the washer yet."
5,These are very good,"These are just plain better than Gildan brand-Gildan are baggy and too long- just did not fit as neatly as this brand doesI will order additional on this brand-These also feel higher quality for lounging - have a ""real"" fabric quality -superior to pure sweatpantRecommend them!!!"
3,Smaller size than labeled.,"They were apparently incorrectly labeled.Even though they said 3xl, they were much too small. I think they should have been marked 1xl, or, marginally 2xl."
3,Without pockets - yea!!,Glad no pockets however lower rating due to the sizing is smaller than usual for the size otherwise happy with the purchase.
3,Reorder Sucks!,Love the item. Even the wife does. Went to reorder and found an increase of $0.80 - no problem. BUT now they want to charge me almost $7 S&H when the original order was FREE. Go Figure! I will not buy more from this supplier until I find an outlet that does not rip-U-off with added unadvertised costs!
2,Bad stitching,Crotch blew out after a week. Luckily I'm handy with a needle and thread. Other than that they seem like decent material.
3,Genuine as per picture shown,The pant is the same description as per the website indicated. It can keep you warm but just that it is not very trendy. Colour is good and didn't fade off after cold wash in the washing machine. Pricing is reasonable. Overall still a good buy for the type of price.
2,Definitely run small,"I ordered these sweatpants thinking they'd make the perfect pair to lounge around in the house or while I'm running a few errands in the cold. Initial impressions when I got them - they got the right color, the fabric seems pretty thick and I was pleased overall. Then I wore them and to my chagrin found that the fit was definitely a little small and snug as opposed to the roomy and comfortable feel I was gunning for. If I could, I'd give the item 2.5 stars, but 2 will have to suffice as I'm in the process of returning the item."
4,"Nothing's better than ""sweats""",Everything was exactly as promised. The fabric is light weight and comfortable. Size and color are just what I expected. Shipping was prompt. Price was good but shipping almost doubled the price of the sweatpants. Yikes!!!
5,Jersez Sweat Pants - No Pockets,Glad to know that Jerzees still makes these sweats with no pockets. Could not find them in the stores anywhere. They are warm and comfy without all the bulk of side pockets. Who needs pockets? Will be ordering more soon.
3,Basic but OVERSIZED Sweatpants,"This arrived in just under a week. They are basic sweatpants with no pockets and a draw-string/elastic waistband. We ordered oxford grey. My husband had a pair of sweatpants of this brand that was a few years old and needing replacement. We ordered the same size that was in the label of the old ones - small (He wares a 30"" waist). The old pair was a nice slim fit, not snug but not bulky either. He tried on this pair and they were definitely too big. He could have worn them if he just needed them for sweatpants, but he has nicer looking, pocketed sweats for that purpose. He likes to use light-weight, no pocket sweatpants under other clothes in the winter, which is how he used the old pair. With the extra bulk, that just would not be possible with these. Check the return policy before buying. I guess we will just keep on searching..."
5,great for around the house and working out,great for around the house and working out and can't beat the price. got them delivered for less than what they cost at the store
3,Ok for the price,"Too long but ok for the price. Color and weight are good, not too heavy. Will see how they hold up after being washed"
5,Claudia Christian makes this dark comedy worthwhile.,"This is a very good film and should be viewed by anyone who is a fan of dark comedies. Murder, supense, a beautiful homicidal supermodel, what else do you need? Also, Claudia Christian is a ""Must See!"" Rather than just serving as eye candy, she proves her acting as well as comedic talent. She really should be in more comedies, and this film is proof. Just as her, the other actors do a fine job with their roles also. So see it or get hexed!!!!"
4,Claudia makes it worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This film was a little off, but Claudia Christian made it worth sitting through. She was a scream in more ways than one!! She's hilarious. And gorgeous to boot."
4,The DVD Is Coming!,"I read on a message board that due to the success of ""Sledge Hammer!"" on DVD, now Sony Home Video is planning to release Alan Spencer's dark little jem ""Hexed"" on DVD! I'm hoping they put out a ""Director's Cut"" as Alan has said in past interviews that his original version was a whole lot different than what got released. What I'm really looking forward to is some feature length commentary from Alan Spencer. His commentaries on ""Sledge Hammer: Season One"" were the funniest I've ever heard, so I hope he tries to top himself (without the earthquake hitting again)!"
5,Its got Arye Gross in it....,"And Arye Gross is worth watching in anything. Truly one of the best actors out there. Plus, this film is genunely funny. Give it a watch."
4,A very funny spoof!,"Imagine what Fatal Attraction would've been like had it starred Leslie Nielson instead of Michael Douglas and you'll have an idea what Hexed is like. Great sight gags and funny one-liners make this film a truly under-rated comedy. Virtual unknown Arye Gross is terrific as the lovable sad-sack and compulsive liar who cons his way into a date with Hexina, a psychotic supermodel bent on killing anyone who knows too much about her secret past. The film also includes several hilarious scenes with Norman Fell and R. Lee Ermey. If you're in the mood for pure silliness and have seen all the Monty Python and Zucker comedies too many times to count, then check this film out."
1,Not worth buying.,"I reckon this book is James' weakest. It lacks suspense, the characters are poorly developed and the whole idea of this book is kind of ridiculous. I seem to get the impression that the author hastily wrote this book to make a quick buck."
5,You love him or you hate him,"In Sepulchre, there is a house that holds a dreadful secret. ""The Keeper"", the psychic and the secret serve a force which threatens mankind itself. Judging from the reviews, readers tend to either love James Herbert or hate him. Personally, I believe he never ever gets the praise he richly deserves. I'm a big Stephen King fan, but when Herbert is on form (as he surely is in this book) he is close to unbeatable. If you've never read a James Herbert novel, make this one your first. It's fast paced and intricate, avoiding the descriptive overkill that sometimes blocks the smooth flow of King or Koontz. He has the amazing ability to make characters absolutely terrifying and utterly deplorable and if you like your horror sick and scary but with a vengeful ending this book is a must. It's yet another amazing example of Herbert's highly original mind."
2,"Herbert, Sepulchre","""There is a house that holds a dreadful secret. ""The Keeper"", the psychic and thesecret serve a force which threatens mankind itself."" This is a breif descriptionof Sepulchre by James Herbert. This is the ninth novel of Herbert's that I've read,and this was my least favorite. I liked it, and respect it for it's story and complexity,but I just didn't get into it that much. I would find my mind wandering while tryingto read it. I kept getting confused by certain things in the novel and had to keeprereading things because I felt like I was missing things. Still, I think it is agood novel and worth the read, especially for the ending. It didn't really have thefeel of a Herbert book to me though."
3,"Different, sometimes frightening, sometimes stupid.","What a puzzle this book was. I felt it has such potential, but just lost my interest when it went nowhere. I don't know what people thought was so wonderful about the ending (other reviews), I thought it was ho-hum. The story, or plot, should have been interesting, but it wasn't.The best thing about the book was the Polish driver's history, and the mystery about the protagonist's true nature."
2,Depraved Oscar Wilde,"Not my usual read- first James Herbert I've read- a fairly fast-moving thriller which gives the author a chance to explore the seedier side of human nature. Shades of a depraved Oscar Wilde and Voldemorte from Harry Potter with a mild bit of anti-semitism, misguided mysticism and IRA thrown in for good measure. Odd sentences abound but I think written for masculine appeal- depraved sex and violence!"
2,Missed it by a mile.,"I am now graduating from school and looking back at this class, this book, I do not agree with it at all. Hopefully your instructor will not use this book."
4,"Good, but some are better","My girls got this DVD along with another Miss Spider DVD (the prince, the princess & the pea). They much preferred the other DVD & lost interest in this before the DVD was finished.Mommy thought the animation & storyline was cute though!"
2,Too scary for my small children,"My kids adore Miss Spider and her bugs, but this story was way too scary. We made the mistake of turning it on in the car on a trip without previewing it and had to turn it off when both the 3 and 5 year old started crying when the frog was attacked. They found it so scary they don't even want to touch the DVD case. This video is probably fine for kids that are older or who don't get flustered by scary things."
5,The Return of the Piano,"I had the pleasure of seeing Miss Amos perform in NYC during this Original Sinsuality tour. I was mesmerized by how immense Amos' ability was at playing the piano. At times, she would straddle the piano bench, playing the organ with one hand and the piano with the other. Truly inspiring.These albums capture Tori solo with her piano, and the improvs and intros have never been more intricate nor beautiful. Her voice has matured, becoming more husky than what she produced in the early 90's. This produces a great contast in sound, allowing for a truly cathartic listening experience as Amos goes from the gutteral to the sublime. A must have for Tori fans."
1,Unbelievably poor!,Actually NO star would be the choice. What a disappointment!! There is absolutely nothing humorous or informative on any page! I wonder about the sanity of the author. Absurd nonsense with no redeeming humorous value is a terrible waste of good paper. I agree with the editorial review: Keep this away from children and anyone else you care about!
5,Hilarious!,I presented this book as a gift to my mother. She is a first grade teacher so she assumed it was for her classroom. She soon discovered that was not the case. She is still commenting on how random and off-the-wall it is! Just simply hilarious.
5,Inspired Silliness!,"If you are into an overabundance of satire and enjoy absurdist humor, then you should buy this book and read every single word including the copyright and any other errant bits you come across. Call it a one trick pony for the type of humor, but speaking for myself, and all but one of the reviewers below, I don't find myself getting at all tired of the trick and flip though it whenever I'm in need of a smile. I hope you find it makes you laugh as much as I do. And if not, more the pity for you!"
3,"Awesomely Weird, Wacky, Delightful","This book is not for everyone. But if you have the right sense of humor, you'll may just find yourself in a tizzy of ecstatic delight, wondering, ""Where has this book been all my life?!"" That was my reaction, and the reaction of everyone I know. Apparently not the 1-star review.This book is the perfect parody of picture-rich books that give people entertaining but entirely useless information: like, say, DK Eyewitness Books (e.g., [...] Giraffes? Giraffes! has beautifully illustrated information that is not only entirely useless, but hilarious. Even if you're not familiar with such books, chances are you'll laugh so hard you cry.Still, I want to give the ""fair reader"" fair warning that if you're in that 1% of the population that lacks a healthy sense of humor, this book may not be your cup of tea. For the other 99%: you'll love it."
4,Not for children only,"My 6-year-old son can hardly believe his father is reading such an absurd and funny book to him at bedtime. We laugh together, and he has that gleam in the eye that tells me he's had his take on the world expanded a wee bit."
2,Kindle Version is too Expensive,"This is a good book, it is a little old and the price has dropped.But, $28 for Kindle is too much (especially when simply replacing the paper version for convenience )"
4,A good reference for those transitioning from traditional software development methods to Agile,"Having employed traditional software development methodology in managing projects previously, this book has helped me by introducing agile concepts & methodology, allowing me to see the difference between traditional & agile, and helping me to know when it is best to adopt the agile methodology"
1,"Objective view, not in this book","I am not good believer of any technical cult or religion, including Agile, Mac, Linux, Windows, etc. Therefore this book give me a feeling of pentecostal preacher writing about ""promise of agile"" to newly converted believers.I am looking for more objective approach, that also understands the reality of the MNC companies building infrastructures for application SW artisans. The ortodoxic approach is good for consulting business of Agile writers and might even suit well for small teams. but i am afraid that hype creates unnessary confusion among some young SW engineers who may not see the background and reason of the hype.BTW. if tall cubicle screens are bad for real Agile, then what is the agile regulation for people who are listening to iPod while working?"
4,A good iterative process overview,This book gives a good overview the most common iterative development methods. It has good advice on which iterative method is good for a particular system developmant. For instance a method that is good for systems that require a lot of innovation VS a system that is highly safety related. It also has suggestions on how to combine diferent methods and what needs to be included foe a particular method.It is a good book for someone already familure with iterative development and wants to set up a process. I highly recommend this book.
4,That's a keeper,"I just completed the reading of 'Agile & Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide' by Craig Larman (ISBN 0-13-111155-8). For once 'manager's guide' did not equate with 'for dummies'. This book is a solid review and comparaison of four main Agile methodologies, namely Scrum, XP, UP, and Evo. It also contains some very valuable practice tips and a generous FAQ section. It is an excellent start for anyone wanting to learn about Agile."
3,Pretty Good Wine Guide,This is a pretty good little wine guide. The author covers some basic information on the different types of wines and what you should expect from each. This is a good starter book if you don't have very much knowledge about wines.
3,"Good, but I prefer the first three ...","I'm a huge fan of Beverly Nye, and her first three cookbooks are among my all-time favorites. However, although this book is good, I don't think it is up to her usual standards. According to her (...) it was self-published with the first printing in 2003 -- waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late to have just written ""1 can tomatoes"", etc., with no hint as to size/weight. This may be petty, but I, myself, would much prefer having the recipes sorted by type (Breads/Salads/Desserts...), rather than months.However, if they have to be divided by months, the index or table of contents could have been vastly improved (e.g., listing the recipe titles in alphabetical order, rather than by page number). I would also have much preferred to read the hints and quotes separately, rather than by month. However, the bottom line is that the hints, quotes, and recipes are all excellent, and anything this author does is well worth reading and learning from."
5,Fun to Read,"This is my latest of Mrs. Nye's books. I'm a huge fan. This one is broken down into each individual month with ideas for cooking, crafting, and/or decorating for holidays etc. It's fun to read. I like that I can just read for the month we're in, example, now October. I recommend all of her books. She offers ways to save money on many things."
4,book-year round sunshine,It is a nice book. I have all her other ones too. It is a little oversized to fit in a book case though/
3,Puhleeze.,I have been trying to track down a copy of this book for a long time for my wife. I would love to get a copy of this book for her birthday or our anniversary.
3,Do you want your brands served up by the marketing department?,"With all the new channels for distribution available and considering all of the innovations in communications (both message and medium) the stakes are not only increasing rapidly -they have been moved. My opinion, the future will very likely be populated by brands that are defined less by big marketing firms and more by real people. This book seems to be ignoring the future."
5,I was amazed by how easy these recipes can be!,"I am so happy with this book! With this book, I now know cooking doesn't have to be a pain and the pictures are great! Two thumbs up!"
4,Great cookbook!,We all buy the name brand products and try the recipes on the container. Favorite Brand cookbooks are a great way to find favorites and new recipes with products you probably have in your pantry.
1,Not as advertised,The item received was not the one in picture. The cover was diffrent. I needed to replace this exact book and what I received was a white cover book. Not the one in picture with the red boarder. Very unhappy about purchuse. This is the second time it has happened so for now on I decided to take my business else where when it comes to buying books.
4,Good . . .,"My grandson liked the book, but he was distracted from the print story by the pictures. I think the words need to be in a larger, bolder print. Otherwise the pictures overpower the story instead of enriching it."
5,Excelent,"After I start reading this book, I couldn't put it down untill I finished it. it is excelent book that opened for me a new view to the life and religion."
5,"Well made, nice product","I bought the Sanus LR1A-W1 with the the SanusUniversal Flat Panel Mount for Displays Up To 40""in order to mount aSamsung UN32B6000 32-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTVto the wall.The unit is well made and works as expected however I did run into one problem. The holes for mounting the swing arm plate to the Samsung are not centered on the back of the monitor (the mounting holes are probably 2.5 inches off center positioned near the top of the monitor), consequently when the monitor is in the collapsed arm position (flush with the wall) the top of the box is still visible. I imagine if it were a 40"" monitor it wouldn't be an issue, but with smaller monitors you should take the positioning of the mounting holes into account."
4,Best solution for recessed installations,"This box allows you to recess the mounting arm into your wall. That means ~4"" less protrusion into the room. Installation is pretty easy if you're handy with tools. The biggest issue is making sure that you have two studs that are 16"" apart (standard) located where you want to mount your TV. So this is probably not so good for a retrofit, since the studs might not be in the right place. (Of course, you could open up the wall even more and frame out studs for it.)It also has a knockout for a cable run in the bottom so you can get your wires for the TV signal (HDMI, Coax, etc) into the wall and a separate place for an outlet.Only negative is that it's hard to install a standard outlet securely into the knockout."
1,Shame on Amazon,"From cover to cover this book is nothing but racist lies. Shame on Amazon for selling it, and I sould say Shame on NOI but they are so foul and dishonet my condemnation you not reach the bigots."
2,Cover of this book is not the same as it appears,"I haven't read the book yet. The cover of this book isn't what it appears on Amazone. The cover isn't blue.I hope it is the correct book and the one that I ordered. It has similiar wording some different, some omitted."
4,A must-have for managers and HR folks,"I'm an HR person myself, and have found this (and the 1001 ways to reward) to be an essential part of my library. Many people want to look through it, borrow it... some have kept it, so this is probably my fifth version of the book that I've bought! Try to put your name all over the book so they don't forget it's yours."
5,Excellent,"As the CEO of a large vending machine distribution company I can honestly say that the company is now unrecognisable after I applied the principles in Nelson and Blanchard's superb guide to energizing the workforce. Their Gay-For-A-Day initiative for equalities awareness was an eye-opener for sure, and has certainly changed the office dynamics. Tremendous."
3,A fast how-to book on energizing teams... lacks depth,"If you are looking to truly turn around your company or department, this is not the book for you. When does this book come in handy? If you are seeking for quick ideas to energize your team, and are short on inspiration: that is where it's a very comprehensive source. But be realistic: true energizing and change is a process that can't be bought with treats or gifts, but rather built through trust and open communication, among other things. If you want to really energize your team, then be ready for a longterm commitment from your part, that will go beyond just getting them perks or giving them awards."
2,really not all that good,"this album is way overrated. I like the first few songs alright and ""Get off"" and that's about it. ""The Dandy Warhols Come Down"" is a much better record than this. Get that one first...................................................................."
4,Solid,"The old saw about talent borrowing while genius steals has never been more apt than when applied to the Dandy Warhols. They make a point of stealing from the best: Stones, Zep, Bowie, Iggy, Dead, Velvets ... and this time around they've fashioned some brilliant rock songs from their booty. Get Off, Bohemian Like You, Horse Pills, Mohammed ... these are quite simply fantastically great riffs, with choruses that stick to your ear like poop to a blanket. As for the Dandys themselves, they ARE rock and roll. In an era when too many rock and rap stars want to whine on and on about how their mom didn't love them enough, the studied decadence, mischief and dedication to good times of the Dandy Warhols can't help but delight anyone who ever fell in love with rock for all the right reasons."
5,Woohoo!,"Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia is a true classic, well recorded with a variety of rock. Some great brass as well."
3,oh,"Wow, somehow I clicked on DIG reviews and started laughing at the interpetations of the docu-film so I check out the dandy warhols and I had no idea I already knew of them. Sleep is on the crazy/beautiful soundtrack that I own. Trippy."
3,"Narcissistic Courtney Taylor, lead singer needs realityCheck",I live in Portland and I've seen this band live on several occasions. They arn't a bad band as far as local band goes. They are worth the cover charge. Perhaps if the lead singer Courtney Taylor wasn't so egocentric and all hot and botherd over himself he could take his head out of his A** and propel the band beyond garage band status. However this is part of the bands charm. Kind of a (I'm too sexy for myself mantality) These guys are supposedly big in places like Ireland and the U.K. . I suppose by emulating the brit scene that would endear you to the U.K. . If you can't make it in the U.S. why not try the U.K.? It's seems to work for this band.
1,Boring....,"Yea yea yea.. yadda yadda.... this album is for pretentious as*holes only. ""Oh, they have the riffs of the Stones but with pop infectious melodies and a rock attitude..."" I can only say that my buddy recommended track 10, Bohemian Like You, and it was.... mediocre. I hear all kinds of influences (Iggy, Beatles, Ramones, Dylan) but never have I heard them meshed in such a boring way. Yawn.... cute, meaningless music for people who think they're cool. For turbo charged rock try the Hellacopters or any old Stooges, sh*t, even Buckcherry is more interesting than this drivel."
1,Disappointed.,"Since I knew nothing about the band, or their music, I can only say that I bought it thinking I would hear more of Bohemian Like You. Well, the album is what it is; but, there isn't more of ""Bohemian Like You"" which I first heard on HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" so if you are expecting the same thing, don't. Beyond this, most fans of The Dandy Warhols like them quite a lot, so, if you know what to expect, you'll be happy with your purchase."
1,boring,"I feel sorry because of buying this cd.If u want to listen better music , go and buy mark eitzel or mark lanegan,they are great.dandy warhols..what a shame"
2,BOOOOOOO!!!!!!,"Terrible, I had gotten this CD with high hopes because of their single ""We Used To Be Friends"", but this CD just lacks much creative beat or rhythem or anything. It sounds like someone who is morbidly depressed and is just singing with sighs, ""lalala...... sigh.... all of us.....""I did not find one song on the whole CD I liked, which is surprising because I think their other CD is pretty decent. Hardcore fans may like it, but I wouldn't spend your money on it. Try getting it from the library and test-driving it. I don't think you will like it though."
4,Music CD,Another great album slightly differently than those before but still has the great sound . They tend to get better production and have a bigger sound with each CD.....
5,buy this and enjoy,"this is such a fun cd. from beginning to end a real real treat. buy this and turn it up, you won't be disappointed."
2,Buy Chronicles of Avonlea instead.,"I was excited to find this book because I enjoyed Chronicles of Avonlea and Further Chronicles of Avonlea, but it is not as good as those books. Perhaps it's because the other books have more recognizable characters from the Anne series, but I also think the writing style of this book is not as sophisticated and captivating as the others. One of the reviewers is right, one of the stories is racist. But, if you absolutely need to have everything L.M. Montgomery wrote, at least what is related to Anne, than going ahead and buy, but it won't be as good as Chronicles of Avonlea."
5,The Road to Yesterday (L.M. Mongomery Books),"This book, and other books, regarding the character of Anne of Green Gables, character created and wrote about, by Canadian Author, L.M. Mongomery, in a series of books. IS A MUST READ AND HAVE FOR YOUR BOOK COLLECTION, BECAUSE L.M. MONTGOMERY BOOKS ARE A MUST!"
2,Not very enjoyable,"As a big fan of the 20 or so L. M. Montgomery books I've read and re-read, I was so excited to finally find a copy of this book. But when I started reading it I was really disappointed. I know this book was published posthumously and wondered if maybe she hadn't had time to polish the stories in it. Basically, I found it boring; one or two stories I couldn't even bother to finish, and others I've never re-read. None of the stories were wholly satisfying; each lacked something of the charm and entertainment of her previous short stories; those that started well ended flat.Another reviewer mentioned that they didn't find L.M. Montgomery's previous short stories satisfying, but I enjoyed the style of those earlier ones, which is perhaps why I didn't like these; they really have a different flavour to her other stories, although she still includes a number of her common themes."
3,Placebic Goodness,"To say this band was heavily influenced by Voivod would be an understatement akin to ""World War I was a bad thing."" Thumping bass, dry drumming, dischordant tri-tone guitar and rasping deadpan vocals all recall the just released at the time, ""Dimension Hatross."" What separates the two records ? Unlike the aforementioned ""Hatross,"" this record steers clear of political undertones and sci-fi framing. Think of it as dress in black, intellectual Euro industrial metal. The background music for coffee & cigarette discussions of the futility of life and struggle to accept the viciousness of the human animal's primal drives. Each song chugs along like a mid/slow tempo collaboration between Einsturzende Neaubauten and early Swans. Definitely just the thing for certain people. As a young Voivod addict, they were a godsend; if only to extend the formula I loved so much."
3,lot to like,"The story of how the first Godfather movie was made is detailed here. The sequels get short sheeted, but the book is well worth the price... just for the story of how the first movie was made."
3,decent player,"the image quality is good, as well as the audio, but i would definatly recommend steping up to the sd3109.why? the remote on the 3109 is a million times easier to use , the 3109 has component video out for even better picture quality, and has built in DD decoding.also, for audiophiles, the 3109 is the only DVD player below $2000 that will read the HDCD format (high resolution CD)which are CD's encoded with 20 bit info versus 16 bit on standard CD's.the differance is very noticable. so overall the extra $100 is well spent on the upgrade to a 3109"
3,"Nice entry level DVD play, not so good for CD use","Everything works, good quality video output, supports anamophic 16:9 (for this with widescreen displays). My one complaint is that the drive is very noisy. This is not very noticable for video use since most movies make plenty of noise what with music, dialog, sound fx, etc. But the drive noise is much too loud for listening to CDs during quiet passages the drive motor is clearly audible from across the room."
3,White Dots Annoying,"OK After much research I bought this player. I love it EXCEPT for little white dots that appear once in a while. These types of things annoy me to no end. I have tested several brand-new DVDs on it and little white dots appear in the SAME place every time. If it was a bad hookup, or bad DVD then they would be random spots but the player keeps having these spots. I am returning it. This player is being discontinued - maybe I'll wait for the new model. Other than that, I loved all it's features! Yes the remote sucks but it is a cool piece of electronics."
1,Does the Job!,I found the Toshiba sd-2109 to be the best machine for the money.The sound and picture are great and up there with the best of them---at half the cost. I've had my unit for four months and I'm very satisfied.
4,Superb player for cheap money,"This DVD player was rated as one of the best in its class.It's one of the cheapest on the market but you can't tell that it is cause of the superb audio and visual performances.Combine it with a Philips Widescreen and a Harman Kardon AVR 65 DD and you will get a new experience of watching movies.The only thing that is negative may be that it doesn't take CDR's but for the money that differs in price between the larger players, you can easily buy a separate CD player.So I recommend it to everyone, at least to start with."
4,Very pleased with the DVD player... Good value for the money,"What can I say? It's a pretty straight forward dvd player, nothing fancy, but plays my DVDs just fine! No complaints."
4,"Great player, zoom a plus, remote a minus","I've had this player for six months. It certainly does the job quite well, S-Video output is great, menu access is speedy. One frill that's turned out more useful than I expected is the ""zoom""; reading credits on our 27"" screen is much easier when we zoom in a bit! The remote is a definite bummer. The old (and now higher end) Toshiba remote is terrific and ""ergonomic"". Well, they still call this an ""ergonomic"" remote, but it is no such thing. All buttons are tiny, hard to find, and in fairly muddled arrangement. Still, the 2109 has given our family a good start in DVD. Have a blast!"
2,Mine was defective. Return in progress.,"I received this player last week, only to find that it draws abright line about 10 pixels wide in an arc from the top of the leftside of the screen to the bottom.Other than the screen glitch, the player meets or exceeds video and audio expections based on the low price. Sure, the remote has tiny buttons, but the navigation arrow buttons are easy to find, and once I hit the play button, I put the remote down for the rest of the movie anyway. I saved so much on the price of this player that I can afford to go get a universal remote if I really want to.If it wasn't for the poor quality control on my particular item, I would have given it four stars."
5,A great componet!,"This is an excelent DVD player...Great video playback, DTS and Dolby Digital sound...And a low price make this machine a must have....I have had my unit for months with no problems. I recently purchased a high end reciever and was overjoyed with this machine's Digital performance.Get a copy of Twister to go with this player and crank your amp! You will not be dissapointed!"
5,Great farewell,"From what I know this is the last C&H collection published before Watterson's adieu. That means the last page and, in particular, the last picture are the last we'll hear from Calvin and Hobbes in our lifetime. They're both absolutely beautiful and I don't mind to confess that I had tears in my eyes the moment I watched them. This book is typically exhilarating Watterson art: crazy, warm, witty, always funny and incredibly well written and designed. The strips about Calvin's snowmen are the ones that probably stand out, but it's a very tough call. A great, great farewell from my all time favourite comic strip."
5,We love us some C&H!,Up to the usual standards of Bill Waterson. We've never met a Calvin and Hobbs book we didn't like. :)
1,"Should be titled, ""It's A Depressing World""...","An only, lonely child. Bullied at school. Clearly a genius level intellect, he's unchallenged and stifled since nobody, not his parents, and not even his teacher, recognizes this. A father who's always too busy to spend any time with his son. A father who's often seen, get this, reading --*reading* -- rather than paying his only son some attention! A mother, who literally, in strip after strip, throws him out the door. Throws, as in ""child flying through the air"". A child, and a small child at that, allowed repeatedly to wander alone through the woods! A child denied even a pet. His only friend -- a stuffed tiger.Makes the ""Peanuts"" look like ""The Family Circus""."
5,Eliah Medina,"My 2nd favorite Calvin & Hobbes book. This book includes (besides more than 150 pages of this awesome comic strip),the very last, and very heart-touching comic of Calvin & Hobbes, which was printed Sunday, December 31st, 1995."
3,It's A Magical World,"After reading all these reviews it seems to be sacrilegeous to write a dissenting review. However, I must say I do not think this is up to the level of ""The Authoriative, The Essential, and The Indispensable."" The subtle humor is missing and the preaching is not subtle."
5,Charming,"If I could be a kid again, I would choose to be Calvin. Funny, smart, witty... just magical. Great work from Bill Watterson. A must"
5,Terrific,"An excellent final collection of Calvin and Hobbes fun, including the last, touching, comic."
4,BIC DV62si speakers,"Excellent value, well built and very good sound quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,excellent value,"I'm delighted with the performance of these speakers and am very pleased with the value-for-money ($127). I'm not terribly impressed by their appearance, but I supposed I could've paid 2+ times the price for a comparable sound and a nicer design. That wasn't in my budget."
3,Nice AV speaker,"Ok, But NOT like the BIC bookshelf speakers made in the late 70s. Those things would rock a room with solid full bass. These need a subwoofer for that same effect. Fine for smooth jazz (yuk). But clearly a case of the new not being better than the original. fwiw."
3,Ehhh!,"I was so very impressed by the raving reports. But hearing is believing. Physically, well built! Mediocre sound. No comparison with a Yamaha half its size. No transparency (hallow colored sound), mediocre imaging. Bass booms at port resonance (can be cured by plugging the port with an old sock, but loose bass response). Not flat response. Good and tight mid and high range. You can get better sound for less if you go to a $80 Yamaha product. All together, not bad. Good try, but no cigar!"
1,Tweeter loose inside enclosure,"When these speakers arrived, I noticed that some large object was sliding around inside one of them. It was, in fact, the tweeter, which had come off of its mounting plate and was loose inside the speaker enclosure. I couldn't see any way to reassemble this without tearing the speaker apart, so I returned the pair for a refund. I was going to order a replacement set, but now that I look through the reviews, I see that two other purchasers have reported the same problem. Seems like this is a repeated manufacturing defect. I'll look for a different brand of speakers."
1,Died at the first use,"Bought them in Aug. Never used them until yestoday. As soon as I turned the amplifier on, the tweeter of one of the pair was dead. I was more than disappointed and desperate, 'cause I am with them now in China, and it is impossible to take them back to the States to change for a new pair!"
5,Great speakers for the price,"Bought in April, 'broke' them in as advised. Not being an audiophile, I can't be scientific in my opinion. I use these speakers as fronts for a 7.1 surround setup with a Yamaha RX-V659 receiver and a Yamaha S5750 DVD/CD player. I listen to classical, baroque, and DJ-remixes/electronica. Music sounds natural and fantastic in my 20'x30'x9' room; almost no need for a subwoofer. Movies are a pleasure to listen to. I think only in superlatives for these speakers - and I haven't gotten the special crossover swap for these yet. I think this setup is better than my father's $2000 Bose system, and is comparable to any other bookshelf system in the $500 range, although I must admit that the Energie speakers are better than the BIC America Venturis... but they (Energie bookshelf speakers) are never on sale, and cannot be had brand-new for under $115."
5,Awesome speakers,I am very impressed with the sound of these speakers. They have a clear high end and and tight bottom end. They are well constructed and are suprisingly heavy. They also look great. For the money they can't be beat.
3,these are just ok. you get what you pay for.,"listened to these for a few days with a HK3490 and vintage Marantz 2252. tried them on stands, no stands, etc. mediocre sound at best. my paradigm titans (v2) sound much more natural and open. much better bass too. polk rti38 also sounds much better. but those speakers cost 3-4 times as much. build quality seems good. nothing wrong with these speakers. but there's nothing awesome about them either. i think you'd be better off spending a little more to get entry level infinity primus speakers. or go even cheaper and get the dayton bookshelf speakers for less than half the price of the BIC speakers."
5,"Old school two channel system with these BICs, terrific sound!","The bass is quite robust, while the highs and mids are crisp. Hooked up to an Onkyo 8222 (with 50 watts each channel), these BICs sound terrific, whether you're listening to rock, instrumentals, or NPR. The speaker build is solid as well, durable enough to survive a cross-country move this past summer. Also of note, when purchased a couple years ago, the price was about one hundred bucks for a pair, which remains unchanged today. A superb buy overall."
5,"Good speakers, great for the price.","I got these speakers from amazon recently and so far have been giving me great audio no matter what I put them thru. I have hooked them up to a few different set ups I have in my house, a Technics receiver running a portable Zune thru the phono input and they have held up. I also have a Pioneer and ran them thru the front speakers with just two others as rears and no sub. Bass was adequate but not great, but for the size they were alright. Highly recommend them.Only real con I can find is you might need to invest in some speaker stands to keep them at ear level for listening or just below for best possible sound. Other than that they are well worth the money and equal to speakers costing two to three times as much even here online."
4,"Really good sound, exactly the product I needed","At the same time I purchased a replacement CD player for my Onkyo system, I replaced my very old floor speakers that have got rattly and been used as a scratching post and worse by cats. These shelf mounted speakers are great improvement in sound and convenience for added room. Could not be more pleased. I am not an expert in sound systems, just want what works for me. So far, I am more than happy with these speakers."
5,Still laughing....,"I purchased these speakers for my bedroom so after I plugged them into my existing system in my downstairs living room, I was kind of prepared for a little bit of a let down. Woah was I very pleasantly surprised! I really couldn't believe that they filled my living room very easily, they sounded great on a 2-channel system powered by an HK receiver. The reason that I am ""still laughing"" is that they cost $109....I feel like I stole them :)"
2,watch out for the lid...,"For a $20 sugarbowl, I expected a better design. The lid has a cute little triangle cut-out for a spoon which makes the lid very unstable because it is designed to rest on top of the bowl rather than inside the bowl. The slight ridge on the underside of the lid lacks sufficient depth to keep it on the bowl. I am a very careful person and 10 minutes after opening it, I was carrying it to the kitchen, the lid slipped off the bowl and smashed on the floor.I compared it to a Mikasa sugarbowl that I've had for years - the Mikasa lid has a sufficient lip and sits inside the rim of the bowl, the design is much more stable.."
2,Poor Design/workmanship on Lid,"This was on sale at my local kitchen store in a discontinued color. I almost dropped the lid.just picking it up off the shelf. As it started getting a little crazy by the EH sale table, I failed to notice that the reason why I almost dropped the lid in the shop was because the lip was too shallow and did not sit properly on the bowl. I am naturally a very careful person & break things extremely rarely.Now I just put the lid away and just use the bowl. The bowl itself is nice and you can warm spiced honey or make n' serve maple butter in it but an actual well designed & functioning lid would've been nice."
2,Never turns up on time,"Great sugar dish, fantastic colour, but Amazon's shipping time of 1-2 weeks is way off. I ordered this twice and had it take well over a month to arrive."
5,"Good Read on Florida Railroading,ACL,SCL,Rare Underappreciated book.","I had purchased this book awhile back, along with The First Edition Of Speedway to Sunshine(FEC BOOK) And this book touches on Florida Rails, Specficially ACL/SCL,Seaboard,Atlantic,Up until this time of the book published, Book Provided me with alot of Insight to the rail scene in the old days."
4,WELL MADE DEFENSE KNIFE,"COLT, WE KNOW MAKES GREAT GUNS BUT THEY ALSO SELL TERRIFIC KNIVES FOR THE MONEY AND THIS IS ONE!!! WELL MADE, STURDY AND SHARP!! THANX GOOD SERVICE AND AND PRICE ""BEAR BAUM"
3,I wish I didn't break my origonal pot,"This is by far the best coffe maker i've ever owned! I love good coffee! My boyfriend broke the origonal pot while cleaning it, so I hopped online and order this replacement. While it looks the same, it leaks when I pour my coffee. Everytime I have to clean up after I fill my mug. It's really annoying, but it works."
5,Brewing again!,We are on our 2nd Cuisinart coffee maker in about 10 years. Somehow I broke the carafe and had to replace. This is the best coffee maker in my IMO.
3,Brittle,I just purchased my third carafe. I got one with my coffee maker and now we have broken two. Just tap them on the counter and you will be spending $25.00 to get another one. Don't bother looking for a replacement where you live. There are none. I have had to buy two seperate times another brand of coffee maker just to get a carafe the will some what fit like the original. Then when I get the replacement from Amazon I clean the carafe up. Rebox it and take it back. What one needs is a carafe made of metal or super plastic. Other wise this carafe is fine. Just be very careful when setting it down.
5,Replacement Carafe,"Exactly as the original that had accidentally broken for a great price. Replacement carafe comes with the lid, which is great because I think we threw out the original lid when our original carafe broke."
3,cuisinart coffee carafe,"I ordered this to replace a broken one; but the lid design of this pot is really user unfriendly; I hate it! I like my coffee maker, though, and since this is the compatible pot; this is what I am stuck with."
5,nice replacement,"I broke my original so I had to get a new replacement, so the next time you break yours this is the one/."
3,Eh,"First one ordered leaked after a few days. Returned it at no cost to me (besides a little hassle). Second one ordered has worked fine for the better part of 2 months. Some people have said they bought the generic brand for a cheaper price. In hindsight, I probably would have as well."
5,Good carafe replacement,"Sometimes carafe replacements are thin and flimsy, this one is perfect. It is probably a genuine Cusinart product, can't product specifics now but pot is good."
5,Replacement Cuisinart carafe,What can I say? It works as expected. It is exactly like the one that came with the original product.
5,Got what I expected,"Stupid me. I used my original carafe as a washing basin (as I always do), and dropped a paring knife into the bottom and pierced a hole in it. Looked all over the place for a replacement carafe and settled on Amazon. Super Saver Free Shipping and it was here 2 days later. Decent price and quick delivery. I only had to buy store bought coffee for 2 days. Lid fits tighter than my original one, but its no biggie."
1,Cheap pdt - it leaks,"I got this to replace my cracked coffee pot and washed it, threw box away in recycling and the next morning used it...it leaked...thought whoops my mistake....the recycling came and took away the box....used it next morning, it leaked....next morning it leaks....leaks leaks leaks...cheap replacement...since I do not have the box any longer I do not know how to return this cheap product..."
1,Much too fragile!,This is the second carafe we have had to replace! We hand wash them but they break for no apparent reason. The second one has lasted all of two months. I won't be buying this brand of coffeemaker again.
3,They got you!,"Product was as required, sent immediately. Thank goodness, I need my coffee! BUT why is a simple carafe half the price of the entire unit; coffee maker and carafe?They got ya!"
1,Silicon the Rim is porous and is leaking,"I just sad that a company of that stature, cannot ""glue"" together the carafe with the rim. It was leaking, had to disassembe it and spent $10 on silikon. No wonder we cannot compete with the Germans, Chinese, or even wood carvers..."
1,it leaks,The carafe leaks between the glass and the plastic top. I sent an email to the company and they promptly sent us a new carafe without even being asked to do so. But that carafe has the same problem. Its impossible to pour from the carafe without dripping coffee. We need to pour over the sink.
2,Overpriced piece of &%$*,"When you pay $70+ for a coffee maker you expect to get quality. Sadly that is not the case with Cuisinart. I've been pretty frustrated with the coffee maker itself (Cuisinart DCC-1200) and now the carafe has broken and I need to get a new one. However, how can I feel good about paying this much for a cheaply made, thin gauge glass carafe when I can buy an entirely new coffee maker for 50% more? Ultimately that's what I decided to do. I picked up theMr. Coffee FTTX95at Lowes for under $45! The carafe that came with that maker is superior to this on in every way--it has much thicker banding around the top and bottom to reinforce the glass, a better designed lid, and a more balanced feel. For those wondering, the Mr. Coffee unit makes coffee that is just as good as the more expensive Cuisinart model, and it's just as aesthetically pleasing.I used to think of Cuisinart as 'top of the line' for kitchen appliances. Not so any more."
2,Waaaaaaaaaaay too expensive,"This is an excellent example of soaking the consumer. You can buy an entire coffee maker for the price of this carafe, but once you've committed to the Cuisinart coffee maker, you've got to buy their replacement carafe only because nothing else will fit. And it's not terribly well made (fairly thin glass), which is why the original one broke so easily.But it does make good coffee. Just be careful washing the carafe."
5,Perfect replacement,It is what it is: an exact replacement carafe for my Cuisinart CBC-00 series coffee maker.
3,buying generic next time!,"Having already replaced my DCC 1200PRC twice a friend advised to shop for the generic version which is available at about half the price! Although I love my Cuisinart coffee maker, replacing the pot had become way too expensive. I am very happy with the model that I found at Total Vac."
1,Great Investment!,There is nothing so satisfying as paying $25 to replace a brittle carafe for a $79 coffee maker.
1,"brittle, overpriced","I could tell it was brittle from the start, and lo and behold, after 3 months, it cracked. (After two DAYS, btw, the plastic cover cracked. The carafe from my Mr. Coffee unit before lasted 15 YEARS because they designed it correctly."
5,Good replacement carafe for Cuisinart,It arrived at the earliest date reflected with the order & is an exact replacement for the Cuisinart coffee maker
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had my Cuisinart coffeepot for 11 years now, and recently broke the original carafe that came with it. Even after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase the replacement. Well let me tell you, believe everything you read here! My new carafe cracked within 5 weeks of using it! I did not drop it or abuse it in any way. I was putting it back in the coffee maker after pouring myself a cup of coffee and viola! it cracked! All I can say is that I will never buy another Cuisinart product again EVER! I believe as others do that the glass is too thin on the replacement model. PIECE OF JUNK!!! Don't waste your money. You would be better off to buy a new coffee maker for $50, than to keep buying new carafes for $20 every two months. I personally will be researching my new coffee maker on Consumer Reports before I head back here to purchase."
3,My caraff,"I love this Caraff, but one thing is true. It is so thin, the glass, that every time I wash it and bump into the corner of thr sink or against anything in the sink, it cracks. I love it, but the glass should be thicker and more sturdy."
1,Will never by another Cusinart Coffee maker again,"I originally bought the Coffee Maker for this Carafe because it was so attractive. Through all the years of owning coffee makers I have never ever broken a carafe, but one little tap on the side of my sink while washing it and crack went the carafe.Really, really ridiculously expensive to replace. When the next carafe breaks..the coffee maker will follow the carafe into the garbage can"
5,great,We were very pleased with our new carafe. Since I broke the original one we were using an old coffee pot that did not work nearly as well. The delivery time was great so we only had to use the old one for a few days.
5,Coffee pot replacement,"After breaking my coffee pot one morning, I mistakenly thought it would be hard to find and/or expensive to replace. Not so to both, I ordered it that evening and in a few days was back to making coffee."
2,The pot keeps breaking.,"This is our third pot purchase, we might as well have paid for a new Cuisnart. The coffee maker is great except the glass pot. we bought our coffee maker 4 years ago and is still working."
3,Top does not fit securely,"Unlike original coffee pot which came with the brewer, the top on this replacement pot does snap into place securely. Sometimes it holds OK and sometimes it does not."
2,top fall off,For some reason the top on this carafe does not snap on so it can fall off when pouring coffee.
3,It's just an overpriced coffee carafe....,It it what I needed since my previous one broke.It's fairly thin glass and a little on the expensive side.I expect to be buying these on an annual basis as long as I have this coffee maker.
1,What A Rip Off,I have had to replace this carafe four times. The glass is so thin and breaks/cracks very easily. I could have purchased a high-end model for the cost of these expensive carafes. Way too delicate for a coffee maker.
3,"Yeeeaaaahhh...If this product was fives stars, I probably wouldn't need to be buying a replacement.","The coffee maker itself is fine. I like the mesh filter as it seems to prevent buildup more than the traditional Mr. Coffee type makers, and it's easy to make a small pot or enough for a large crowd. I also like that the carafe must be in place for the coffee to drip, making it easier to fill your cup while the coffee is brewing. BUT - I do NOT like the fact that I was washing out my carafe, barely tapped it on the edge of the sink, and shattered the bottom of it. I literally DROPPED my Mr. Coffee carafe many times and it never broke.Next time I will buy something more heavy-duty."
1,Good for a week before breaking!,"This carafe is a piece of garbage. We have had 3 of these carafes shatter in the last 2 months. They were not dropped or treated harshly...the last 2 broke simply while handwashing them in the sink. Based on other reviews, this is a known problem and probably constructed like that on purpose to get suckers to pony up more $$$ after their initial coffee maker purchase."
5,Perfect replacement.,We had the toughest time finding a replacement and the cost at Cuisinart's site for the replacement was significantly higher than through Amazon.Com.
2,Guard that carafe! It's worth a fortune!,"There is nothing wrong, so to speak, with this carafe. The problem is how much it costs to replace it. I bought my coffee maker for just over $50, and it will cost nearly half that to replace the carafe, which is made of very thin (and probably not too expensive) glass. I should note that my original carafe cracked with just a light knock against a stone countertop. This is a rip off, but as the folks at Cuisinart know, they have you at their mercy. Who is going to stop drinking coffee to save a few bucks?"
5,Works as its supposed to.,"My pot was lost in the move from cali to texas, and this does the same job just as well as the one that came with my auto grind coffee maker. Works just as it should nothing else needed to be said."
1,Replacement Carafe,This carafe came. No packing slip. It leaks badly when you go to pour dripping all over your counter.Maybe you will get a good one but this was bad.
2,Lousy design,This is the second coffee pot that I get for my Cuisinart and the design is terrible. The lid gets loose really fast and eventually breaks off. I just got this coffee pot and the lid already feels loose. You would think they would make a better design so you can take the lid off without stressing the plastic.
2,Cuisinart Carafe,"The Cuisinart coffee maker makes good coffee. Unfortunately, within a week of purchasing it the carafe was broken. I have a Black and Decker that I have had for 20 years, and the carafe never had a problem. The glass needs to be more sturdy, and replacements are too expensive."
4,Just as Described...,"Great product, and great price if you purchase more then $25 you get free shipping, that will be a better price than other sites that charge up to $8 for shipping."
1,Disappointed,The lid or top fits too tight. Difficult to remove. If it wasn't so much trouble I'd send back for a replacement lid.C. Fugitt
5,great buy,the cuisinart is the best coffee maker I have ever bought. The carafe is very well designed as it never drips when you pour the coffee. I will buy another cuisinart again in a heartbeat.
1,Broke within 90 days of purchase,"This coffee carafe is the exact fit for our coffee maker, which we have used for years and have enjoyed. We recently bought this replacement carafe, since our original (in use for several years) cracked. The glass of this replacement carafe is thin and obviously not very sturdy. It broke tonight after light use, while being hand-washed in the sink, within 90 days of original purchase. I am very disappointed. If you can find another to fit your coffee maker, go for it."
3,"Breakable, handle with care","We seem to break it about once a year, so we always keep a spare on hand. It works fine otherwise."
3,"This will also fit the CHW-12 coffemaker with hot water system, and is the same as DCC-1200CRF","On the cuisinart website, the replacement carafe listed for the CHW-12 is DCC-1200CRF, however it is the same as this one. This one was made for the original coffemaker without the hot water system. Cuisinart should have gave them the same stock number to stop confusion. It took me quite awhile to find out they were the same, and I still was not quite sure but took a chance and I was right, they are the same. It was better for me to use Amazon since I have their prime membership and get fast shipping, plus the item was 5 dollars cheaper at Amazon. I could only give it 3 stars because the carafe is easily breakable (by bunn carafes were much more sturdy). I also don't like the fact that the carafe is so expensive- cost me 20 bucks."
3,Replacement glass carafe,"I love my coffee maker. The only problem I have is my glass carafe recently was accidently broken, and the replacements are difficult to find. I have not found ANY replacement carafes in the local stores that sell the Cuisinart coffee makers. I still have not replaced it since this item is currently unavailable!"
1,Disappointed,"Very happy with my coffee maker which I have had for a long time. Unfortunately the carafe got dropped and had to buy this replacement which within a very short time became a ""dribble"" type of carafe which leaves us wiping up coffee all the time. The coffee leaks out from under the plastic ring. Never had this problem with the original. Its about 3 months old. Amazon says over 30 days contact the manufacturer. Cuisinart says you should have bought it from us but it has no warranty whatsoever so just buy one again. So I need to spend another 25-30 bucks or spill half my coffee on the counter."
1,2 1/2 months & now a new carafe,"I've owned Bunn coffee makers for over 20 years. I like them and the three minute coffee they produced. I felt I was ready for change, and I like my new Cuisinart coffee maker. I can live with the 12-15 minutes it takes to create a new pot of coffee. 20 plus years, I never broke a Bunn carafe. Now, 2 1/2 months after buying my new coffee maker, I'm buying a new carafe. I couldn't tell you how it cracked, but it's cracked and costs a little less than 1/3 the price of the entire coffee pot. It's very thin glass, and I'm at a loss. One more carafe and I'm back to a Bunn boy."
1,4th carafe in 2 years,"So frustrated. I purchased the cuisinart coffee pot 2 years ago and am very satisfied with the coffee pot itself. However, the carafe's are absolute garbage. I will now need to purchase a 4th carafe after the 3rd one lasted only 5 days after breaking for no apparent reason this morning. I hand wash. I used extreme care for the entire 5 days I owned this last pot. This morning I filled it with water. A chunk from the center of the bottom of the pot literally fell onto the floor along with the entire pot of water. I called customer service. Was told there is no warranty on the glass and I should return it to where I purchased it. and they were rude. Hate to give this company more money - would have been much cheaper to go with stainless the first time around."
1,Cuisinart Replacement Carafe,The Cuisinart coffee maker makes good coffee but the carafes are EXTREMELY fragile and cost a lot to replace given the price of the coffee-maker. A huge downside to this product.
5,Just like the Original!,"If you broke your original cuisinart 12 cup coffee carafe , and you're going through coffee withdrawals, order this coffee carafe. Why get the shivers, when you could be drinking a cup of liquid pow!!! Because the best part of waking up is coffee in your cup. Seriously, this is an OEM cuisinart 12 cup carafe. If fit perfectly into my cuisinart coffee maker. It was like the coffee carafe had never broke. I am now stocking up on dunkin donuts orginal and hazelnut. GO AMAZON!!!"
5,Cusinart Carafe,I broke the original carafe and had to quickly find another one. As usual Amazon had the right one for a great price that even Cuisinart did not have one.
3,Why did this need to be replaced??,We ordered and received a replacement Carafe for our NEW Cusinart coffee pot. THe carafe order was processed quickly and received in perfect condition in a very timely manner. The carafe was a perfect fit and priced fairly. The problem here is the Cusinart coffeemaker was recently purchased for our vacation home and we used it 5 times. We noticed leakage on the hot plate and upon inspection noticed that the carafe had several hairline cracks. The replacement carafe is fine but this never should have happened to a new coffee maker.
4,Holds Coffee,"I can't get excited about this purchase. My old pot broke, so I bought a new one. The price may seem steep, but keep in mind this price includes shipping. You might be able to find it $5 cheaper at your local appliance store, but I prefer the convenience of buying online. I liked my coffee maker enough to buy the replacement pot, so that's a good sign right?"
4,Works as advertised,"No question this works as advertised. Unfortunately, I keep breaking the pot. At $20, though, this was the last replacement I'm buying. When I break this one, I'm buying a new coffee maker that comes with a metal carafe."
3,Cuisinart DCC-1200PRC 12 Cup Replacement Carafe-Black,"OK and functional, but not as good as original. Pot makes cracking noise when i rinse it. Must be contraction of glass to metal strapping, or..."
5,kenmore replacement,I got this to replace the one that broke on my Kenmore coffee maker and it works just fine. I had a dream that it cracked too but when I awoke it was fine.
5,Exact replacement,We bought this carafe to replace the one for our coffee pot that developed a crack. It is an exact match to the one it replaced. No problems!
4,hoping history repeats itself,I've had my coffee maker for almost 10 years. The carafe had held up super well but recently got a small crack. I'm not sure what caused it but am hoping the replacement carafe will allow me to continue to use my coffee maker for just as many years+.
1,cheap,"How many more should I buy before I decide to buy a better coffee maker, with a pot that doesn't break so easily?However, it does catch and hold the coffee..."
1,i was wrong,I recently gave this brewer a good review but since that time i have been unable to make a pot of coffee that doesnt leak all over the counter .What a mess I bought the GOld Filter and thought that would resolve my problem but it didn't so i am going to buy another machine . This is a very temperamental coffee maker I cleaned it tried different settings read the instructions no luck buyer beware
2,Thin; costly; no customer service,"As others have stated, this carafe is very thin and easy to break (please tell my why one of the reviewers gave it 4 stars and she's on her FIFTH carafe in 3 years and is ecstatic...); also, Cuisinart has you by the short hairs when it comes to replacement. As for its efficacy, unless you pour a VERY SLOW cup of coffee it's going to leave all over the place. I've never had another decent quality carafe that would leak as badly as this one. I've written customer service twice asking, ""Why did you make a carafe that leaks?"" and have yet to receive a response.So, -1 Star for thin glass, -.5 star for proprietary replacement, -1 for the leaking issue and another -.5 for no response as to ""why did you make a carafe that leaks""."
1,Wrong item sent,"I have been making numerous attempts to correct the wrong item with no success. I have sent my coffee maker model and what i need and recieve no help frrom Amazon or no answer from the distributor. So my rating is ""0""Craig Angell"
1,It would probably crack if you gave it a dirty look,Glass is way too fragile. I had it on the hot plate with coffee in it and I literally heard it crack What a piece of junk!!
1,Horrible carafe,"I received this coffee maker for Christmas 2008. I think it was $60. The original carafe broke within the first two months after being lightly bumped in the dish strainer. I sucked it up and paid $25 for a new carafe and it just broke while I was hand washing it the other day. To be honest, I am not going to buy $50 worth of carafes for a $60 coffee maker. I'm very disappointed that Cuisnart would produce such a poorly made product. A coffee carafe designed to hold hot coffee should not break while hand washing. I went out and bought a Mr Coffee maker for $30 with the same type of features and let me tell you the carafe itself looks way more durable. Don't waste your time or money on this coffee maker."
4,It was what I ordered,"Perfect replacement. Cuisinart needed to have offered a stainless Steel carafe since the glass ones break so easily (this is the second replacement in as many years); but, they don't for this model and were not very helpful getting a replacement model number or anything. Fortunately, I was able to get this filled thru Amazon. Quick and easy. Thanks"
4,"Cuisinart Replacement Carafe, DCC-1200","This Cuisinart replacement coffee carafe was as expected. This item is difficult to find locally in any discount or retail store, so you almost have to order it online. Amazon was the best price after considering free super saver shipping. I have to agree with others that this carafe is very fragile with respect to the thin glass it's made out of. This is the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars. It's also a little pricey running almost a third of the price of a new coffee maker, however I love the DCC-1200 coffee maker. It's the best I had yet!"
2,Lesser quality is standard,Lid doesn't fit properly but what's a person to do? You buy the coffeemaker and expect the MANUFACTURER replacement to be the same as the one you received with your machine. It isn't. Poor manufacturing will result in me changing to a Bunn. They're consistant.
3,Good machine but just okay Carafe,I love this coffee maker but the I have had bad luck withe carafe cracking. I've been through two carafes and had to purchase a 2nd coffee maker while the new carafe was being shipped (a cheap one from the local grocer). That was the worst thing about it. I'm glad to see it is available through Amazon Prime now since it took 3 weeks for me to recieve a new Carafe from Noble Sales. Beware of that retailer.
1,"Defective product, terrible customer service","We purchased a replacement carafe for my wife's Cuisinart coffee maker. It broke within a month. We then purchased another one. It broke within a week.I believe that many if not all of these carafes are manufactured with weak or defective glass so that it breaks so easily and you keep having to shell out more dollars to Cuisinart. We contacted the Cuisinart customer service, and they refused to acknowledge any problem, offer any apologies, or any credit to my wife who had been a loyal Cuisinart customer. It is not surprising that they will not admit that the product is defective, since they would not want to face a lawsuit.My advice is, defective product or not, terrible customer service is a deal breaker - DO NOT PURCHASE ANY CUISINART PRODUCTS!!!"
4,Taut & gripping movie.,"This bears many re-watchings. The movie is so well done and the actors are so real in their portrayals,a athaat each watching seems like the first. There is a minimum of violence so it is a movie for all ages."
3,Overpriced!,"I bought this item for a gift for my daughter. I love the idea of it, but the items are way TOO SMALL for the price. I would not buy this product again."
4,Perfect gift,Gave this to my mom and her best friend to their birthdays! They both loved them and the message on the bag!
3,smaller bottles than expected,I had got one of the philosophy gift sets as a gift and wanted to give this set to a friend for her birthday thinking that the size of the bottles would be the same. But it was not! These bottles were smaller which I wasn't expecting. If the bottle size would've been the same as the one I got I would've given this a 4 star.The product itself was great!
1,Missing Items,"I wanted to surprise my sister with this gift set for her birthday so I shipped it to her as an amazon gift. She was very happy with the gift set however, she only received four items in the set instead of five. It was missing the foot scrub. I'm disappointed and returning is such a hassle..."
3,Hard to Follow,"Even with a background in theoretical physics, I struggled to follow the mathematical arguments of this book. One has to have a good grasp of mathematical statistics to follow this book's mathemtaical reasoning. On the other hand, the conclusions are quite clear; speciation cannot be supported within these models but minor variationscan.The author does mention the idea of punctuated equilibrium but points out the absence of plausible mechanisms for it. He then proceeds to mention his hypothesis of ""Evolution from Space"" (his book, ""Cosmic Life Force"" goes into more detail) as a possible mechanism; that is, genetic fragments are constantly falling to Earth from outer space and getting incorporated into DNA of various species - sort of like the novel ""The Einstein Intersection"" by Samuel R. Delany.I think the book is worth reading and struggling through; it is a very dense introduction to mathematical genetics and has a good discussion of the short-comings of standard Darwinism."
4,Good quality speakers!,"They're sounding quite nice!Not as good as the larger cabinets, because these are not full fledged speakers.They're surround speakers; or high quality satellite speakers.They sound great when mounting them in a corner of the ceiling and walls. Can handle a 100W amplifier just fine!Have a range of about 20ft (hang several of them every 20ft, and you'll have a great sounding system!)And it was a bit unclear, but they actually came in a pair."
1,don't bother,this product was a waste of money-lousy sound-actually worth less than it cost-buy another product
4,Sharp Harp,"I picked up this out-of-print CD from DG's old ""Privilege"" series in the Marketplace for a few cents. While I already owned the very same recordings of the Handel and Mozart Concertos presented here (viaGreat Works For Harp), it was the only way I could find to purchase Nicanor Zabaleta's accounts of more obscure works by Wagenseil and Spohr. The price I paid for a used copy was cheaper than it would have been to buy the downloads, so I figured why not. Everything Zabaleta plucks turns to gold, so my reason then for withholding a fifth star is merely for the redundancy of recordings."
1,Doesn't work with Comcast Cable Box,"I wanted to put my cable box on the other side of the wall and use this device through the wall, but it didn't work."
1,Fiction,"""Celtic Shamanism"" is a myth. Most books claiming totell about ""Celtic religion"" and Celtic ""magic"", includingthis work of fiction, are full of inaccuracy, fantasydisguised as historical truth, and items that have beenproven time and again to be completely false."
2,Don't bother with this,"Don't be fooled. Clean and Clear only wants you to think you're cleaning your face and opening your pores with this product. Instead, this gritty slime clings to your face long after your shower ends and makes you feel even more oily before you started.The ""warming sensation"" is actually somewhat uncomfortable and not something I looked forward to in using the product. I finally just gave up on it altogether and threw the whole tube away.Pass this one by."
4,scottish,"Scottish books are becoming my favorite! Talk about being dragged to the alter - he literally was all to stop a fued between two families. At first I wasn't sure about the hero's character and wondered if he was going to turn out a true leading man. My doubts were snuffed out and this is a book I will tell all my friends to buy. If you love scotland and highlanders, be sure to read sabrina jeffries ""beware a scot's revenge"". And if you walk a little on the magical side - anything highlander by Karen Marie Moning."
3,Do not abduct this book,"This book did not live upto my expectations. It started out interesting enough, however it did not maintain the stamina of the book. The story could have been more fun and interesting with the two main characters, but it fell flat. I was quite dissappointed"
2,Wish I didn't buy it,"This is the first book I've read by Karen Hawkins.I just did not like this book. Fiona seemed too selfish, I really tried to like her, but she just annoyed me (the way she was mad at Jack for not changing for her after shes forced him to marry her). The family curse seemed interesting but it got tiresome and Fiona's brothers just seemed to get in the way too much. I thought maybe the curse would play a bigger role towards the end of the book and it started to, but it all just died out. I didn't buy Fiona and Jack's love for each other either. I was more interested in Lucinda than any of the other characters. The end of the book is the worst, there was hardly any resolve, it all seemed rushed and ended too abruptly. Some people really liked this book, I just expect more from a historic romance."
1,"Good for windows, but does not work on Linux","I bought this modem thinking that it was compatible with Linux since it is an ISA modem. However, I wasn't able to make it work on Linux. The reason for this is that the modem is a ""winmodem"". This is a modem that only works with windows 95/98/NT, etc. The drivers that come with the modem could cause problems with some sound cards so you might need to download the latest drivers form Digicom. The modem performance under windows is satisfactory. It has all the typical features of a 56K modem. So if you want a cheap but good modem and you do not care if does not work in Linux, then this modem is ok, but I you are one that has multiple operating systems in your computer I suggest you buy a modem that is not OS dependent."
1,Not true PnP and horrible technical support,"This modem is not true PnP. After installing in a Win 98 environment, found out that the drivers are not in Win 98 and were on a CD-rom with it only (no floppy disk driver disk). So I had to install a CD-rom in the computer, loaded in the drivers, and the computer wouldn't recognize the modem. After going through the poor technical support options in the manual, I called the technical support # and after going through ""option # hell"", ended up being transferred to a busy signal. Today, tried twice, busy signal twice. Have never talked to a live human being at ""Digicom"". I'm returning this."
2,Very shallow plot,I really did not enjoy this book. It had a variety of unusual plots that really were quite bizarre. Thanks
4,Four stars and a half!,"I would have given this book five stars if there had been just a few more activities in it.The book reads as non-fiction literature and is interspersed with good photos and interesting sidebars. There are also some useful activities for the child to do within the text to reinforce what is learned.This book would be useful for all grades but can be read independently in the middle school grades. The book contains a glossary, index, web site suggestions, bibliography, listings of museums and parks and other handy references."
4,Without Reservation,"Maintaining the tone of a child writing without sounding precious or contrived saves this author's work of fiction from joining the glut of thinly-veiled confessional memoirs in my trash bin. Without making the artistry of her novel distractingly evident, Pierce presents what appears to be a rough coming-of-age story. Extrapolated, it could well be the charting of any cathartic moment of disillusionment and realization. In the particular, the author clearly pays homage to her roots with great love and offers us a glimpse into a world on our shared continent yet an ocean's divide away economically. Held together by its own traditions, this world is further cemented by difficult universals of family and compassion. The end is a bit of a cop-out after a novel whose overall tone is refreshingly honest and ambivalent, but overall it's not half-sugary. Gripping, even."
2,Mom of Twins Review,"I tried this pillow while nursing my twins, hoping it would make things easier. I used it for about a week before switching back to the boppy. I felt this pillow was really expensive and it was so big. I had a hard time getting ready and adjusting. I was much more successful popping the boppy on to my lap and then double nursing the twins."
4,Abracadabra Is Fabulously Delicious!!!,"I have been an ABC Martin Fry fan for as long as I can rememeber. This band has never gotten the recognition it deserves. We all know that the Lexicon Of Love is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to end but Abracadabra comes very very close. It is definately their best since the debut of Lexicon Of Love. It surpasses Alphabet City and the quirky How To Be A Millionaire by far. The music is funky, jazzy, soulful, with a club twist without the annoying standard club beat machine. And, what can be said about that soulful, sexy sound that comes from Martin Fry. It just doesn't get any better!!!"
5,Superlative,"I was walking through the Mall of America at Christmas so many years ago and I heard the most glorious piano music being played. I found myself following the beautiful music until I found the piano and Terry playing in the mall. Normally I would feel too busy to do more than think it nice but he was so good. Peaceful and beauty were the overwhelming feelings I felt in me and I found myself sitting down and I listened for hours. I have never done that before nor since. I bought his album All Things Bright and Beautiful as well as one for my sister and also made arrangements to buy Dancing On Air, Never Felt This Way, and Solo Companion. I am in here now hoping he's made some more CD's and I will happily buy them."
5,Great Book!,This is a great book about the Stanley Cup Well writen great photos. I got this book used so try it used at a good price.
2,Didn't meet our needs,"Wanted to use in place of handheld wireless microphone, but you still had to hold it up to your mouth to get good reception."
1,Garbage,"Amazing! When you open the box, you are greeted with WM-Pros not WLX-Pros. It's printed right on the modules!Transmitter range is awful!Mic is tinny and cheap sounding.High pitched buzzing noise, regardless of channel 1 or 2!Mic level signal is too low, but since it's noisy, there's no point to increaing the gain.I feel cheated and scammed. I truly hate this product!$140! Yeah, it's not that much, but I expected better performance. This system is no better than the $35 Sima system, at least it did not have high pitched buzzing.Garbage!"
3,"Dependable, plastic, not professional sound","Overall, this is a good investment for beginning videographer. It works as described, yet I found that it's sound needed post work if it was going to be presaentable. My standards are not unrealistic, yet I was disappointed when I first worked with this mic. It comes with a lavalier mic, and a handheld. Of the two, the handheld pickup better, and is more manageable. Both only record in mono, so you have to set your camera to place the signal on the two channels, or do so in postproduction.Still, if you wish to use a mic that is dependable, is inconspicuous, and has a small learning curve, this mic could serve your purposes."
4,Great Mic,"For my purposes -- handsfree audio for video presentations -- this mic has proven itself well up to the task. Sound quality is very good, range is more than adequate for my needs."
3,Example on Youtube,"We use this mic for our webseries ""Fights You've Had"" and find it to be frustrating to use but an upgrade in quality from the standard camcorder mic (I use a Canon HG10). As stated in other reviews it picks up too much camera noise when mounted so we have to find ways to attach it to other objects in the room and point it at the subject. The shotgun sound is pretty much unusable so I always keep mine on the short distance setting. Works best no more than 3 or 4 feet away from the subject- any further than that and you will notice significant loss in sound quality. This mic requires an extension cable and either a boom or some creativity to maximize its potential. Search youtube for ""Stanley, Fight's You've Had"" for an example of how this mic performs in action."
5,Great mic,Go this mic in the quickest time and slapped it on my camera... great stuff. I do say: you need it you got to get it...
2,Get what you pay for.,"I purchased this mic for my Cannon GL1 to cut out the background noise when I'm shooting my projects. When I first attached the mic I thought it was off because the sound was so low. It did an okay job cutting out the background noise, but also cut down the volume of the subjects I was shooting, This mic is only effective when I am 2-4 feet away from the subject and even that sounds a little low. In post I have to raise the dbs to a least +10 to hear clearly what people are saying clearly. Right now I am saving my money to buy and xlr adapter and a rode ntg1. The mic is good if your shooting an event where the speakers have microphones. Its not good for documentaries and any project on that level. Please do not use the long feature on the microphone, it is horrible."
1,Very disappointing.,"While the product looks great on the counter or nightstand, the radio reception and sound quality is dreadful. And each time you turn off the radio, it resets. While I didn't expect Dolby sound or Tivoli performance from it, I was expecting quite a bit better from a name brand. Not worth it."
1,"No Sound after one year use, although free repair available.","Sound quality is good but not great, software is horrible, and no sound after one year use, there is a free repire from sony, try google ""No Sound or Sound Issues From Headphones s703f"". Sony repair it twice before it finally works again. No more trust on sony product anymore."
5,Great Review!!,"I had four US Government Review books and this was definitely the most useful to me. (I had the 99-00 edition, but took the exam in 2001). I ended up scoring a 5!"
2,"Great test prep, bad on education","THis book is very helpful but there is more to government and politics than the AP exam. While this book is good for anyone who is concerned with a number grade on the exam, students like me who are trying to understand how the laws of our country shape our existence, will find it very disapointing."
1,Kill it! Bury it! Hit it with a rock!,"I've never played a game this mind blowingly bad. I couldnt even get through more than 10 or 20 minutes before I just had to turn it off and get rid of it. This game makes Shaq Fu look good. It makes ET feel like it has great gameplay. It's just a bunch of minigame repetitive tasks which don't even work well to begin with. Do not buy this awful, awful, AWFUL game"
1,not worth it,do yourself a favor and rent this game before you decide to spend your hard earned cash on it.
1,Don't even rent it,This game is awful. Even for the price. I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes of the game. Don't even bother to rent it.
4,Buy this game..,This is a very strong game and has very few weaknesses. Its an absolute steal at only $20. The game has good legnth a very good storey and is great after long hours of playing games like oblivion where you have to focus. You just run in and hack enemies to death with your inhuman abilities. The game runs around 6-8 hours. That may not seem long but you will find yourself playing sections again after beating it the first time. Its feels great tearing enemies arms off etc.
3,Interesting Coincidences,"This book lists two authors. One of them is a fairly good writer. The other tends to wander aimlessly. You will be able to tell which one is which as you go from one chapter to the next. ( It looks like they took turns. ) Some of the coincidences sited in the book as actual historical events have, upon further internet research, been found to be urban legends or myths. However, if you are intriqued by coincidences in your own experience of life then you will enjoy this book."
3,My review.,Product came bent and dented from shipping. The product itself is decent and works for my needs but was disapointed in the condition it arrived. The aluminum tool box is placed in a thin card board bow with ZERO padding which accounts for the damage. I would have refused product if I had known it was this damaged at the time of delivery. The UPS driver and I did notice one dent but it wasnt bad (tear in box showed damage). I opened the box and found several more. I was also in a hurry to complete a project on my own vehicle so I will live with the imperfections/damage. Best to inspect these items at a store and take home with you than rely on a shipping company not tossing These light boxes around.
2,"Lots of parts, but really really soft metal","This set only gets it's second star because it is a fairly complete set of hex bits. All the bits are super soft, I was able to bend the metal flanges on a number of bits using a small hand screw driver. Maybe it's cheap enough to look at it as a bonus if you ever get a second use out of any of the bits.I'd never use these in a power drill, as I'd be afraid that it would just destroy the bit."
5,Horribly underrated thrash kings!,"This band is amazing and this album is one of their best. How this band didn't get the credit it deserved is criminal. They out perform any of the big four even though I love them too and thats a huge statement. But listen to Razor's albums and you will see, I hope these guys come back again soon to kick our a$$e$. This album is worth it for Marshall Arts alone let alone the treasure trove of metal on this cd."
5,awesome thrash album from 1988,"This album came out of nowhere. It's nothing like the other albums before it but it's better and more aggressive. The three albums after this one are all evolutions from this one. This album was picked up by SPV from Razor's independent label, Fist Fight Records. That shows how impressive this album is. The tone on this album and the ones that follow it is kind of like Exodus but not the same. I love it. There are no bad songs on this album and there are 14 songs. This is definitely worth getting, even if it's $20.00"
3,Hisonic Portable Voice Amplifer HS110R,The unit works well when standing still. The headset is cheaply made and falls off if you move or bend over. The mic is too heavy for the headset. I was able to make the mic work by attaching it to a lanyard that I tightened close to my neck. That way I could use it for fitness class and for teaching CPR. The batteries must be charged frequently.
3,ok but not great becasue of static noise,"It is a small unit and works well. It may work well outside activity.The problem that I have is that it makes static noise.It is actually quite annoying with constant noise level.So if you ging to use inside use, buy more expensive one."
2,"Incorrect item, tardy customer service","I needed this item for one of the public functions. Ordered one and received a wrong transmitter unit. Of course, it did not work. I called the customer service and had a reasonable response. They promised to send me the correct unit, but it never arrived. I then returned the unit with the help of amazon, and apparently I am getting reimbursed. Did not like myself wasting hours to resolve this, and also did not appreciate paying 15 dollars to return this unit, as it is not my fault. We all need to live upto our expectations!"
2,not great,It fits great but does not wear well. The finish scratches and wears off. Used it for a couple of months but looking for another case.
2,dougv,"Awkward sentence structure and long sentences. Thus, too hard to read.Stick to the New American Standard Bible (most accurate) or the New International Version (accurate and very readable).Choose your translation carefully. If you enjoy it, you're much more apt to read it."
1,Bought it for two bucks...two years later and I still haven't gotten through it.,"I thought this book would be cute and funny and was hoping for a ""plotless"" series that at least had logic, humor, and thought put into it (such as Crayon Shinchan or Azumanga Daioh). This book is sooo boring, and the art is not very clear. I was at least hoping for a LITTLE depth to the story, but there wasn't even a plot...This is a boring book, and I do not recommend it unless you get it at a super cheap price and just want a comic to look pretty and fill up your shelves with."
2,Dissapointed!,"Expecting a book on technique, I was hugely dissapointed! Turns out the book is merely a collection of brief, general descriptions of lazzi. The Commedia character overviews also included in the book were, for my purposes, useless. The book contributes nothing new to the world of Commedia Dell'Arte. What I do find of value are the two Commedia scripts included in the book. Save your money, there are other books worth their weight in gold on the subject of Commedia Dell'Arte"
4,Needs update,"This is a pretty interesting book. What may work in Israel might not work in the US or California. A good portion of the book is devoted to the use of two handguns. The author describes various rigs and guns. He covers what to wear and like. Well, he might be able to go around in Israel with a two gun brace, but here in California my local Chief of Police is not going to give me a concealed carry permit. So, a good portion of the book is sort of useless. If I don't have a CCW, then I can't be driving around with loaded handguns in the car.As with all topics like this, the reader is advised to beware. He does have an excellent point. That is that all of us individually are responsible for our own safety. The reader is admonished that the police will not or may not be able to protect."
2,Not terribly relevant except in a fantasy world.,"This is a mildly interesting book about the methods the author uses to keep himself safe in the Holy Land. You will not learn much that is of practical value in the USA. I'm not even sure I believe that he goes always armed with several pistols and knives. If you follow his recommendations you would find yourself under arrest for a variety of felonies in most US jurisdictions. Other than those caveats, it's a decent book!"
1,Outdated.,"Outdated. Poor quality typical of paladin press. If you really want to learn combat, attend one of those gun camps run by ex-operators. Better than Army training!"
5,not for the faint of heart,"If you had one book to read on street survival- this would be it. Now, if your looking for a information on how to beat up the barroom bully or 5 easy moves that will make you undefeatable, this isn,t the book to read. If you really want to gain insight into the brutal reality of street violence and the the kind of mindset you need to deal with that reality, you will find it here. The only other book that comes close, in my opinion, is Walter Rauch's book. Most of this book deals with the use of weapons, so if the idea of arming yourself with a firearm or a weapon of opportunity repulses you, you won't like this book. The book does get very technical when discussing firearms. Even if you don't envision yourself evr using one, it's valuable information, because guess what: the person jacking you up on the street will probably have one! The author also stresses the single most important thing about survuving the streets- awareness."
1,Not suitable for most.,"This book is written for the gunhappy and if you want to walk around armed to the teeth for the eventuality then this is for you. There are some unarmed combat techniques but I am afraid the focus is mostly on guns. I grew up in a very rough part of the world dubiously called the""murder capital of the world"" and can save you money by letting you know that if someone knows you have a gun, chances are you are bigger threat for them and hence a target.Guns are not easy to hide- read the sas books or the krav maga books which teach you how to survive attacks. Most books and this one included assume you are allone- what if you are with you family and you cant shoot in case your family gets caught in cross fire?Save your money and go on a practical course where all aspects are taught to you and yours e.g travelling in groups or allone,paying bribes to officials,how do you find help in a foreign place without the language?This book is for the gun happy"
1,Not Food Safe - Metal Finish Flakes,"Upon unpacking the meat grinder I noticed that the finish had flaked off and left metal particles in my hand. Since all interior surfaces that come into contact with food have this fragile coating, this grinder is not at all food safe. I will be returning this back to Amazon and looking for some other meat grinder of much higher quality."
1,Meat grinder,"I am very disappointed with this product and I will probably return it. the auger is very poorly designed. It requires much force to get any thing to actually feed into the grinder and also turning the auger handle requires a lot of force. My previous experience with meat grinders made in America varies widely from this unit. Most well designed units self-feed once the meat product enters the auger and generally require much less turning force on the handle, even with larger units than this one. the finished product is acceptable with the exception that the meat is excessively macerated during the grinding process.I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Not worth it,Total crap!! Finish started flaking off on the first day. Does not grind well at all.Packing it back in the box and returning it!
1,lots of work,Bought this grinder to make some venison and elk sausage. It constantly gets plugged up and you have to take the front off and clean the knives off. Also you have to do a lot of grinding and pushing to get the meat to push forward through the cutting blades. Would make a nice hood ornament!
1,Horrible product - very poor quality,"Not worth whatever you pay for it. This was the cheapest one at the time I was looking for a meat grinder, so I decided to give it a try, in spite of some of the low ratings. My mistake. There's a reason it has low ratings. I didn't mind that it took quite a bit of force to turn it, but the lead angle and thread profile of the extrusion screw is so poorly finished, about a third of the meat simply fed backwards and turned to mush instead of extruding out the front knife mechanism. Unfortunately, I threw the packaging away and therefore can't return it, but will give it away at work (the fate of many home products I no longer want) and will go get a more expensive version. Or perhaps I'll simply have the meat departments at the grocery stores do the grinding for me (probably easiest approach)."
1,Do not buy this product!,"If I had known this product could not be returned, I wouldn't have purchased it. It is next to impossible to get it to work properly unless you are extremely strong! It would not stay fastened to the table my husband attempted to affix it to. I spent almost an hour trying to grind a roast into hamburger before giving up.I would not recommend this product to anyone. I wouldn't give it any stars but didn't have that option. Buyer BEWARE!"
4,"strong voice, still.","Donna Summer's stage presence is somewhat faint compared to other performers who can easily make themselves known on the stage before they open their mouths. She thrives boundlessly on studio recordings, without the of confines and stiffness that spontaniety can sometimes bring. However, what gives this particular recording four stars is Summer's ever strong and powerful voice, never showing fatigue throughout the entire disc. And every song is instantly recognizable, even with slightly altered arrangements. The best is saved for the end with her 100% rocking version of ""Hot Stuff"". Donna still completely has it and even more...Hey, if anybody can add to this page what the three additional tracks on the import version of this are, I would muchly appreciate it. Thank You!"
5,Wrightslaw: IDEA 2004,This is the first book you need to purchase if you have a child in special education. Educating yourself on educational law is essential. This author explains the information in a very clear and reader friendly way. You and your child don't have time to waste...purchase this book. I wish I had heard of this long before I did.
2,misleading size,"you cant tell from the picture but this thing is only about six inches tall and can hold about 2 cups of batter, and i feel like i could break it if i accidentily dropped it. i should have guessed that from the price."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I foolishly tried this donut maker and feel now I should have listened to everyone else! It again, is miniscule and can hardly hold a thing. Also it will not make an even donut at all! What is the point of a device that does not even work!"
3,So far not such good luck,"I'm not sure what I thought it would be like. The recipes for doughnuts that came with this product make a thick batter that continues to thicken once made! Even right after it's made and put into the funnel, it is TOO THICK. In order for this to work, the batter needs to be thin, like a cake batter. The recipes make more of a quick bread batter. I'm still in the process of finding a good recipe to make cake doughnuts with this thing. Otherwise I'll just stick to yeast doughnuts."
5,Great Shirt..Great Quality,"For 12.99 this is a real ""find"".Excellent Fabric and Stitching..........looks like the 50.00 ones."
4,Mark VII Men's short sleeve golf shirt,"Sized appropriately, good quality. I chose white, ivory, red, blue and burgundy. All wear well. Naturally, the darker colors will fade after many washings...more so for the red and burgundy than the blue."
5,Excellent Value!,I am very pleased with the quality and value of these shirts. They stand up to repeated wearings and washings and the price cannot be beat!
3,Good but not great!,"This is a MONO mic, so you need a $2 convertor from Radio Shack. That said, the sound is loud, but not very nuanced. The $499 Sony UHF Wireless System is the best way to go. However, at $153 the Azden Pro VHF Wireless is pretty good for the price. Get the UHF Sony is you can afford it, otherwise the Azden is the next best thing, and it is so very cheap."
3,Great Value!!,We bought this to use to record sound for video while preaching the Gospel to people on the street.It has worked wonderfully!!
5,excellent product,"This is an excellent product. Works very well, simple to use professional quality microphone. I use it when on stage performing my comedy routine. I tuck the receiver in my pocket and run the mic up the inside of my shirt. Also plan to use it for sketch comedies and film.If I ever I want to have two mics, I think what I'll have to do is purchase another one of these systems, and an azden mixer. Then run both transmitters of these systems into the mixer, setting mic 1 and transmitter 1 to frequency 1 and mic 2 and transmitter 2 to sfrequency 2.Again, simple and a great investment."
1,Maybe something was wrong with mine,"Like some others, the mic system I received was completely unusable. It appears that other people are getting ones which work fine for the price while plenty of others share a problem with the mic being unable to pick-up sound from a reasonably distance without screaming into it. I think we can safely chalk it up to a build quality issue because the product isn't consistent."
4,Everything I was expecting,"I recently purchased the Azden WMS-PRO to help me with sound quality in video blogs, and I'm really impressed with the quality of the product, especially at such an affordable price. I've used it at a distance of at least 100 feet and still had perfect sound. It was easy to use, basically plug it in, and away you go. The only drawback I have is the belt attachment piece leaves a lot to be desired."
1,Did not meet my needs.,"When it arrived I realized it was not going to meet the need that we had. Also, I want to return it, but there was no information on how to do that."
4,Good Microphone Lav for the price,"I recently purchased this mic for my Panasonic HD camera, It performed well although the volume was a little higher than what I expected according to my meters.other than that the mic performed well. One of my little concerns about this mic, is that the clip to attach the microphone to people's belts or other clothes seems flimsy and I think is going to break really fast.The handheld is also made cheaply and has the feeling of a toy, but it still does the job well enough.Good purchase for the price and to have as a back up (just in case)BUT I wish I have more money to buy a better one."
3,Should be cheaper,"This unit should be cheaper. I just got it today and found the sound somewhat low on both microphones. It's definitely plastic, but the 9v battaries will add a little wait for you. I wouldn't count on the velcro helping you much as an alternative attachment to your camera. You'll be better off using the hotshoe or your tripod as a mount. Finally, did I say it should be cheaper? Like say seventy bucks. If you're not doing that many video production jobs that warrants spending $500+ on a wireless system, then this set up is your best bet. I'll use it for a while, but will upgrade and have this one for a backup."
4,Works as expected.,This wireless mic works as I expected it to. It has good coverage even outdoors. I would like to see a boom mic instead of the hand or lapel mic.
2,Good not great,"Sound was clear and works great with camcorder but I was planning on using this with a digital audio recorder as well. As far as I can tell, only records mono which I wasn't aware of when buying. Maybe more my fault for not searching well enough but would have been nice to have that description in the specs. Distance wasn't too bad but in a high school setting, could use a little further. I would rate the distance at about 50 ft. If you are using for simple video applications, works well. Did not test in wind."
2,Too Much Interference,"I returned these. There was too much interference and I couldn't get the sound monitor earbud to work, so I couldn't tell until watching the recording on playback just how bad it was. It was ununsable audio. Very frustrating when trying to do a recording for work!"
4,Happy with Azden WMS-PRO,"Just tried out the wireless microphones. LOVE IT! I'm using it on a Canon VIXIA HFR3000. The sound is clear and the lapel mic can't be beat for the price. Thanks Azden, this is a quality product.The wireless transmitter and receiver are easy to use. Just throw in a 9V battery into each, flip the switch and away you go."
4,Hi quality - but stay still or . . .,". . . you'll hear noises. I agree with others that the sound quality is top-notch for the price. However, we had hoped to use this mic system for presenters, feeding the sound to the public-address system in our meeting rooms. The sound was fine as long as the presenter stayed in one place. But when he or she would walk around, the system introduced a loud ""pfft"" noise, seemingly at random, every ten or fifteen seconds.It turns out you need to spend hundreds more for a wireless transceiver system to get ""diversity"" reception - a technology that gets rid of that kind of noise. That said, the sound was great as long as the person stayed in one place -- but some presenters insist on moving about."
3,"Not bad, but easy to pick up hiss","This set came as a bundled part of my camcorder outfit. I've used the lavalier several times and have encountered hiss problems about 70% of the time. This necessitates using Soundtrack or an audio processing program to reduce it. I have tried out the wired handheld once on a shoot and the sound came back HORRIBLE with extreme distortion and I haven't used it since. I've had it about a year and I'm likely to send it for service, so I can make use of it. And I'm just considering this a starter set and I plan to replace it with something better in the future."
3,Get what you pay for,"I use this system for recording corporate training (mostly internal use) with a Panasonic HFS21 so it was hard to justify the 600+ pricetag of the Sennheiser professional units. I figured, how bad could it be? Well, the audio quality is acceptable, but the range on this thing is awful. Anything greater than 15-20 feet (indoors under fluorescent lamps) and you get unacceptable levels of static. In conclusion, if you are recording at short range and high quality sound isn't important to you.. Pick these up. If not, you're going to need to spend more money on Sennheiser/Shure units - or go wired."
5,a really good pice of equipment,This mike does exactly what we needed. Cuts out wind noise pretty well and the range and sound quality are excellent. The ear piece that is attached to the camcorder receiver is a nice touch so the person on the camera can hear the sound level. We did have to buy an adaptor to mount the receiver on the camcorder (Panasonic HDC TM300). Overall a great buy.
3,Not up to snuff,"Bought this for the coach's comments while recording soccer games. As long as I am on the same side of the field, everything is ok. But, if I am on the other side of the field the signal is very noisy or not there at all. Much less than 300feet quoted in the specifications.This is close to the ideal situation, open field, no obstructions, outdoors.So, if you are using this for close in work. Worth it. Get it.If you want to push the range, find a different solution."
2,Don't walk away from the receiver,"I got this based on other reviews. It may have been a bad unit but it sounds terrible! As long as you don't walk more than 5 feet away, you're fine. Otherwise, save up a little more and get the Sennheiser."
2,Horrible,"I have been dealing with these for the last year and my hair is turning gray. The signal pops every minute or two, the sound quality is sub-par, the noise is loud. Spend an extra hundred and get something that will work."
4,Wrong Description,"The description of this product lists that each unit uses 1 AA battery. This incorrect. Upon opening the package to put the batteries in that I had just bought prior to the mail coming, I found that each unit takes a 9v battery. So make sure you get the right one!Other than the incorrect description, the microphone works fine. I did some tests with walking around various parts of the room with the clip on mic and spoke at different levels. The mic picked everything up fine. The receiving box plugs into my Sony 3.5 jack without problem, although the recieving box itself does not attach to the camera which is kind of a pain, but works ok when I have it set up on the tripod."
2,Maybe worth $50,"I got the unit to use on my Canon T2i DSLR, it fit nicely and the construction is fine as was the range but the sound is vary poor. The noise floor is high (it has a noticeable hiss) and the sound transmitted is two quiet as well as seeming muffled. I tried some high end headset and lapel mics with the transmitter and the sound was still bad. Now I just need to save $600 for a sennheiser."
3,Not bad - Not great,"Well first off it is Mono - so you will need an adapter to get around this. Finding the adapter was not as easy as I thought - went to several Radio Shacks, WalMart, and Target - Nobody had what I needed. Finally found a place on line that had it. Signal strength is decent, I have on occassion had some interference problems. For the price it does a decent job, however...I wish I would have spent more and gotten something a little better."
4,Great product!,"used this mic for a kickstarter video, and it was awesome. I even shot outside and the sound quality was great. If you wish to hear a sample, go to [...]The website wont be up until mid september but that is where you will find it. The reason why I didnt give full 5 stars is because the mic has a lot of background noise. Also, I wish this mic was stereo, but that is easily fixed with the adaptor."
5,Nice economical wireless mic system,I shopped around and read many reviews before buying the azden wms pro.. I didn't have the 500 or 600 hundred dollars that many people claim is the minimum necessary to buy a quality system.. I've used the azden at weddings and other situations on windy beaches and it has worked great
4,Not quite what I was hoping for,I had a lot of high hopes for this item but there is a constant buzz. I'm able to eliminate it in post with fcp but it would have been nice to have a system that worked perfect for out of the box. The in ear monitor is a nice feature and I like the way it mounts onto my T3i.
5,AWESOME,NOW SOME WOULD SAY I'S OK 4 THE PRICE..BUT HEY I SAY THIS IS JUST AWESOME WHEN I HOOK IT TO MY CAM IT GIVES A PROFESSIONAL LOOK AND THE SOUND IS AWESOME...ONLY DRAW BACK IT'S MONO..BUT THAT'S KOOL I USE THE MONO 2 STEREO ADOPTER
2,"Horrible Static, have to use SoundBooth to fix it","You get what you pay for. We needed an urgent lavalier for a project, and because for us it was uncertain just how much we'd use this type of thing, we went for the cheap option instead of the Seinheiser (however that's spelled). Well, just as many other reviewers have reported, we do get better levels than with a shotgun, but they're accompanied by terrible static that we have to later eliminate in Adobe Soundbooth (just use the ""Eliminate Noise"" process and voila!).Definitely NOT recommended for Pro-level work, but I guess if you're a Pro, you already knew that. If this is for occasional use and you have the CS Suite, then it might do the job."
1,"I'd give it a rating of zero stars, but that isn't one of the options","I bought this for my husband. The screen is too dim for him to see. When I called the company the reaction of the ""customer service"" moron was pretty much ""tough luck"".I was hoping to exchange it for a better model (and pay the difference, of course!), but wasn't allowed that as an option.Unless you have super vision, and/or money to waste, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Ease of use makes this a winner,"I bought this for my 70 year old dad to keep track of phone numbers, tee times and drs. appointments - he loves it!"
2,Did not work for me,I was unable to get it to sync up with our computer and we have Windows 2000. So it was no use to me.
1,Works fine as a DOORSTOP,"There is NO day-at-a-glance kind of screen! I don't know how Sharp could develop and market a product without a daily view. (The unit only shows weekly or monthly views that are limited in content.) If you buy a paper day-planner (or a PDA from another manufacturer), what's the key building block of the system? A DAILY VIEW.I bought this as a replacement for a Casio PDA, since this has a similar interface/OS, but Casio no longer makes a PDA model. Too bad--this one stinks."
1,Don't use this Vendor,"I purchased this Sharp Wizard. I received the Wizard, but NOT the appropriate software, nor the cord that would connect it to my computer for communication to the device. The vendor will not provide me with a credit for my purchase, but wants me to send back the Wizard! Guess what... They are not going to have the wizard returned until I see the credit on my bank statement!"
3,You get what you pay for.,Although the Sharp Wizard perfoms as designed it is a low end product and the display leaves a lot to be desired. Altough I bought this for my wife when compared to Palm products I own the Sharp is a disappointment.
3,Review of the Sharp Wizard Electronic Organizer,It is a good item for addresses and phone numbers and daily planning. If you have a lot of information you want to put into to it I would go with a PDA CPU or an item which lets you create your own files. The words on the screen with this one are tough to see being black and grey and I have good eye sight. I'm going with a color screen. This is the best bang for the buck. The cover keeps you from depressing the buttons and keeps dirt out.
1,Piece of junk!,This is a piece of junk unless you have much younger eyes and can put up with an almost completely unreadable screen.
4,Great Product for your money,"This is a great product and I have had no trouble working it. The only problemn I had is I was missing the stylus when I received it. But, I just went to the local gammming store and they hooked me up with one. I have no problems with it or the software. I loved it and so does my son, I think I am going to have to get him one next!!!"
2,Don't buy from Sharp!,"I had this item for 1 week, dropped it one time on the carpet and the screen cracked, making it completely unusable. I called Sharp to have it fixed and of course, since I dropped it, there was nothing they could do. What they could've done in the first place was make a product that was more durable and wouldn't break so easily, so as a result I do not recommend their products."
3,adequate though not exceptional functioning,"I had one of the original Sharp organizers 15 or so years ago and liked it, found it very useful. Thus I bought this personal organizer as an inexpensive alternative to a palm pilot to use just as a calendar, making use of its scheduling function. And it is just that - a ""cheap"" alternative; For the price, it is great; however, I am disappointed in its display of daily and weekly schedule items. It isn't as easy to view/keep straight appointments as I would have hoped for. It is acceptable/useable, but could easily be better. However, I don't know that I should have expected much more for just $40+, compared to $100 or more for a true PDA. I also find it easier to input my appointments using Microsoft Calendar on my computer and just sync-ing the organizer, rather than inputing directly into the organizer. I don't use much of the other functions, though available - seem ok."
4,likes and dislikes,Sharp 0Z-590A Personal Organizera very nice product at an attractive price. like everything about it except hard to see monitor in direct light even after adjusting the contrast and plan on a lot of manual reading if you use several of the functions available. overall very satisfied and will like it even better when I can rely on my memory to use most of the functions and not have to return to the manual quite so often.
2,Terrible Display,This product has terrible display quality. It is hard to view in a bright room and the resolution is disappointing at best.
2,Not that great,"Although I have had mine for a while, I can't sync it and there are lines running through it and I can't make out the date, YES! I have put two new batteries in it. Still the same."
2,Very disappointed,"Well, this thing started out great and left me very frustrated. I have had it for 18 months and initially I was able to manage my schedule very well, although it was slow to put in new appointments. the trouble came when i tried to hook it up to Outlook, which I rely on heavily. ""No connection detected"" or something like that, was all I could get. So, the unit quickly became a paperweight when I couldn't back it up or update it from Outlook. Why should I enter all my appointments and contacts twice?I struggled for a while and still have lots of addresses in it, which really sucks because the screens ( I have TWO of these) both developed vertical lines that made my phone numbers indistinguishable.My son will be using these things for target practice as soon as I get my new Palm Z22. My advice: fine for basics, but don't rely too heavily on this thing, and it's not very durable."
5,Sharp Wizard Personal Organizer,Works very good. Have problem with connecting to PC. Will not work with Office older than 2008. Mine was a 2007. Other than this problem it fits the need.Thank YouJim Hague
4,Sharp Organizer,"I bought this item for my wife's birthday, as her old organizer of more that 14 years old started failing.This new hand held organizer is smaller and does the things she needs most, like Email's, tel; # and such.Excellet price, and shipping made it on time too.Alex Campbell."

2,defective,"This product has everything I wanted, so excited to get it. Unfortunately, there are ""sun lines"" (?) vertical and horizontal across the screen obscuring the view. I cannot even tell what time it is. Not sure if it is because it is an out of date product, though new. It came in its package. I wrote the sender and Amazon but no response. Though the price was certainly incredible, I am still without a product. Sorry...if one can find one without defects, please let me know...I still want one."
1,Don't look behind the curtain - -there is no wizard,"This product really has been a waste of money and time. I am already looking for a replacement. The scheduler does not work well, and trying to keep up with calendar changes has been difficult. The screen is hard to read.In the end all I wanted was the ability to have a portable calendar and address book -- something simple. This simply does not work well -- the calendar is difficult to use/read. I tried to transfer my address book from an older palm into the computer and then to the Wizard -- it doesn't work, so if I do keep using this, I have to enter the entire address book by hand. Bummer.I really am disappointed in this."
2,Sharp Wizard,"This item was not worth the money I spent on it,the battery life is very low and the back light as well and it would not comunicate with my computer so I was not able to down load my emails it said I did not have Outlook Express on my computer which I do duh!!I was unable to enter names and adrresses,it just is a waste and it will begiven to my grandchild to play with"
3,Terrible screen,"Does what you'd expect an older generation organizer to do. My biggest grip is the extremely hard to read gray LCD screen. It's hard to read in dim or dark rooms even with the backlight, and it's hard to read in brightly lit rooms or outdoors because the glass is highly reflective. Please note that the item pictured on Amazon is the OZ-590 (green) and not the OZ-590A (silver)."
3,Neat - but doesn't sync with Outlook 2007,"I like the minimalist concept - all I need from a PDA is a calendar, contacts and synchronization with Outlook. I am using Outlook 2007, and that is explicitly not supported by the software right now (and not surprisingly, it doesn't work either). Sharp customer support couldn't give me a date for when (if ever) they'd update the software, so I returned it."
3,Display Too Dim,"Was disappointed in this product and have returned it. The display was too dim even with fresh battery and with backlight turned on. Also, the attached cover does not snap into place when covering the screen - just flops around. It probably works fine when turned all the way to the back and used as a prop. Decided to pay more and get a Palm with color screen."
2,Hard to read for old eyes,"After seeing this I read the reviews and thought it would be just what I needed.I purchased one and after I put the battery in and hit the ""Power"" button I wasn't sure if it had turned on. So, I pushed the backlite button and the screen became lighter. The symbols and letters were almost impossible to see.I went through the menu and turned the Contrast as high as it would go in both directions. No good. The screen was just too hard to see and almost impossible to read. I'll be returning it tomorrow.Maybe I got a lemon? The sticker on the screen was easy enough to read."
2,Disapointing product,"Just not worth it. Punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum. do you carry the manual with you. put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language. truly disappointed with this worthless plastic. Seldom am I this disapointed in a product but this one is truly the exception. i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal. price-wise, it was great. however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well. the directions are terrible. they are extremely difficult to follow. i never could get it to sync with outlook. i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work. i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was much easier in comparison. in this case, you get what you pay for. don't purchase this, you'll be sorry. ."
1,"good for older computers, I guess","I couldn't use it with Windows 7. Completely useless to me. Called CS and they said it's not compatible. Thankfully, they let me return it. I don't really know if it's any good at all since I couldn't use it. Just a warning that you need an older OS to use it."
1,Don't waste your time,The scheduling portion is TERRIBLE. Hard to read and there is no calendar. Have to look at every appointment to find anything.
3,Nice Unit but weak,This is a nice item for appointments but doesn't give you any way to mark the appointments as to what they are.
2,Did not work for us!,"This product would be the right solution for us but it does not work with Outlook 2007, only the older version. Therfore, we bought an updated Motorola Cell phone (at a much higher cost) that has the capabilities we need."
3,What I think.,I am pleased with the product. I expected more. I had bought 2 and decided to find a different one for my wife as a gift.
1,Won't sync as advertised,"This is a nice organizer for the price. Easy to use and has all the basic features, but it wouldn't synchronize with Outlook 2003 on a Windows XP computer. Without the sync feature, it's worthless to me.I contacted Sharp support several times, but they could not find a solution. Despite this, they referred me back to Amazon for a refund, which I can't get because it's been more than 30 days since I received the product.I'm unhappy with the product and I'm unhappy with Sharp."
3,Finally got outlook synchronization working.,"After I got the product, I struggled couple of hours to get it synchronized with MS Outlook. Everything seems fine but it would say communication time out and nothing get transferred. Then I noticed that my computer time does not match with the one on organizer. After setting the organizer time to the same minute as the computer (I could not set the seconds), it is able to synchronize. I think every one has to go through some learning curve to get used to this. Once you got used to it, it may become easy to operate. Ignore my star rating as I did not compared it with any thing else. I could not update this review without selecting my star rating."
4,Superb !,"Outstanding picture quality. Very easy to use with a lot of features. Sound quality is very good (but not oustanding, that's why the 4 stars and a half) when compared to my YBA CD player. To fully take advantage of this excellent DVD player, do not hesitate to spend for audio and video cables (I use Wireworld interconnects for the Audio and XLO for the S-Video). The difference well designed cables can make is just AMAZING!"
1,Be careful,"First off these are actually 5 star headphones and I just wanted to rate this 1 star to get your attention. Yes, these are definitely ""audiophile"" grade headphones. I paired them with an Asus Xonar sound card with the on-board headphone amp. Brought me to an entirely new plateau of what music and everything else could sound like. It was really amazing.However it didn't last. To the uninitiated you are not supposed to use headphones like these all-day or other extended periods of time. I had no idea about any of this and it didn't take me but a few weeks to develop tinnitus in one ear immediately (with playing everything at reasonable volumes). Tinnitus is a permanent and irreversible form of hearing loss exhibited as a continual perception of ringing (or some other noise) of the ear. This can be extremely difficult to live with.I imagine most people buying these already know what they're doing, but if you're like me, be extremely careful with these."
4,"Denon AH-D5000 Headphones are good, be weary... inspect every part","I had it delivered with the cord frayed and worn a little, even though promised brand new... and I don't like how there is a screw thingy on the headphone jack. Other than that, the sound is really amazing.. a very natural tone; however, I believe I'll be going for a more digital sound next buy."
2,"Sound great, but teriible cables.","I bought these to replace a pair of Dennon 2000's I had that broke, and these were a step above those. To me they sounded fantastic once they were past the burn-in period, which was about 10-20 hours or so of use. They definitely got better with use. However, the woven sheathing on the cables is a problem. It makes the cables very stiff and unwieldy, plus the black woven sheathing started coming apart in spots exposing the white batting material underneath. For such expensive headphones, the cables are quite poor, and I returned them and got a new pair. The second pair also had the same problem, and I returned them too and purchased a pair of Senheisers instead. For that reason, I do not recommend them even though I thought they sounded as good or better than the Senheiser headphones for my taste. The cables on the 2000's I had had similar cables, but the sheathing seemed to be a bit better quality, and never had the problem of coming apart like these did."
5,Best ever product by DENON!!,"Hello everyone !! About 15 years ago I purchased my first DENON headphones and never had no problem with! They still sound great and in excellent shape!But there is time to upgrade my DENON!!The AH-D5000 r excellent headphones , nice deep bass ,cristal clear treble !!!!Outstanding comfortable !Recommended !!! , by proaudio experts!!!!"
5,Great Sunzilla seeds!,"I received exactly what I expected, and I received them within the time promised. All but 2 of the seeds came up. I would use this vendor again."
2,One seed germinate,Only one seed germinate and I like it. But feeling sad that only one seed germinate. I added pictures for the one seed germinated.
1,complete ripoff!,Packaging left a lot to be desired. Seeds arrived crushed. Only abour a dozen seeds. I paid 11.00 dolars and package indicated it sold for 2.15 US$ !!! PLease see some pictures posted of these products. Better you choose another brand provider Noc ustomer service either i worte them before reviewing the product and have yet to receive a response.
5,Love these,"Used them for my wedding in June and I loved them. I would recommend them to anyone, they are perfect for any occasion :)"
4,Love them!,I am very pleased with my LOVE plates. They arrived with a small chip but it was too close to my event to exchange. Honestly once set up you couldn't tell it was chipped. Delivered on time. I'm very happy with them
2,Chipped letter,"I received the LOVE plates promptly but even though they were packaged in bubble wrap and packing peanuts, one of the plates was chipped. I couldn't send them back because I needed to use them for my wedding the next day, but i was very dissapointed to see the large chip in the letter V. :("
4,"Cream, not White","These are cream, not white - be sure to look at the 3rd photo for the color. Otherwise, they were nice quality, and a good size."
5,A great MP3 player with a unique look,"I like this MP3 player because it's small, light and stylish, it has a lot of neat features, and it's less expensive than the others out there. The screen is bright and sharp, and the touch buttons get you to the different menus very easily. There's plenty of room for songs and pictures and it plays videos without a problem (the earphones included are excellent too). One of the most important things that separate this player from the others (especially ipod) is the battery life. It really lasts a long time. Other cool functions are: the radio with 20 station presets, the sound equalizer, and my favorite - the voice recorder function. I have a lot of fun with that one! Overall, this player has everything I wanted. It's well-crafted, the design is unique, and it's inexpensive. I'm very happy with mine."
2,not user-friendly,"After several years of use my ipod broke, so I decided to try something less expensive. This mp3 player, while sleek and stylish, is not at all user friendly. It is difficult to operate and navigate between and within menus. Right now mine is stuck on the radio setting and no matter what I do, I can't get change it. It also only lets you create one playlist. Also after weeks of use, I have not been able to change the volume! I feel that these types of things should be more intuitive in this mp3 player. While there are lots of different features, none of them are very good. I would not recommend this mp3 player to anyone. Unless you are willing to spend days memorizing the user manual and 'practicing' with your player, do not buy this mp3 player."
1,"Big on hype, small on performance","I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity."
2,Just not worth it,"I chose this book because I had already read its sequel, ""Lawd, Mo Drama"", and wanted to read its foundation. What a waste of my time!!! I finished the book because I thought it had to get better. But I was wrong. It was poorly written, filled with stereotypes, and just boring."
4,Entertaining,"I read Tina McKinney book All That Drama and found it entertaining. What is life without drama, someone is living it and Sammie is the character of her own drama. Sammie confused love with abuse, the two equated to attention. Maria has her own issues but felt the bond of sistahood with Sammie and the drama became her own. It wasn't a bad read, realistic for some people whos accustomed to that kind of lifestyle and friends who are magnet to drama. I give it a 4 rating but still entertaining. Even though Maria had to die (spoiler)I really thought it was Sammie but that what makes a book interesting, unpredictable.buddiflyGottaBReading"
2,disappointed,the book didn't really do anything for me until the last 3 chapters of the book. that's when it really got good.
4,How do you spell DRAMA....Marie and Sammie,"Tina Brooks McKinney debuts with a winner. This book is full of drama, drama, and more drama. It is emotionally charged, laughing one minute and crying the next! Join Ms. McKinney has she takes you on an up hill journey into the lives of Sammie and Marie. You feel the pain of each of these characters, as they come alive and jump out at you from the pages. This is a page turning, fast pace, and enjoyable read. The ending caught me by surprised and off guard. The book is definitely worth the read. Kudos to you, Ms. McKinney."
2,Too Confusing,"I will be the first one to say I enjoy a book and all it entails; but this book was nothing but a BALL OF DRAMA CONFUSION!! first off, you didn't know whether Sammie or Marie is fat or skinny or what; Not enough character development; then it got a bit confusing on Norman; He was great initially, but he's going to go all the way off because he couldn't get a child from Marie for income tax deductions? that don't make no dang sense; Nope, this story needs more developing to me; sometimes, I couldn't identify with who was who; Sammie was initially shown as glamourous, and then fat; why didn't it show a progression as to how she got to that; What about Althea? no more about her at all; no, I ain't feeling it and those who wish to get it, well, get it at your own risk;"
3,Only good for school projects,"Manatees & Dugongs isn't something anyone would want to read in their spare time, but it was really useful on my manatee science project. Full of info and statistics, it's informative but of course quite boring. (Since it's a research book.) If you're doing a school project on manatees, read this book!"
4,ok,"I had 5 different helmets before, all of them were large. This large barely fits in my head, I need to remove the inner liner to use it. Other than that, is a normal open face helmet. The vents don't help much, but I only use it for short distances. I got it for $20 dollars with free shipping, so this is a great buy for the money."
4,"A classic spanish singer ""tonadillera""",Un disco que refleja la belleza y frescura de su canto y sus melodias. Un excelente ejemplo de la cancion española de la mitad del siglo
5,fantastic,First picked this cd up in Ireland (as a cassette).Driving up into the mountains in the middle of the Ring of Kerry the song Nearer My God to Thee came on just as we were reaching the peaks. It was an awesome feeling.
5,Enchanting,Played for the first time after a heavy snow while following a stream on a tree shrouded country road. Will never forget that soul soothing experience.
3,CD ORDER,"I received the CD in good time but the packaging wasn't good enough to protect the plastic case that a CD comes in. The plastic case was broken, but the CD was ok. Had to find new holder."
3,Ever Ask - what's the name for that little doo-hickey?,"Recommended for any writer by Robert Olen Butler, and has already been very useful to me. For instance, I needed to know the name for the ribs in a ship, and got it instantly."
4,Intimate Danger,"I have enjoyed Amy Fetzer since I read Naked Truth, and I absolutely loved the character of Clancy in this book. However, while the other storylines in the book were relevent to the story, I felt that there was too much of that and too little character development for Clancy. I would have loved to know how she became the person she was, and more about her relationship with her family.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and will continue to have any books by Amy Fetzer on my auto-buy list."
2,for fans only,"Unfortunately this CD is for fans only. I am one (and a hard core on to boot), but some songs (Could you, Sunshine, the Elton cover) are just boring. For fans only, the cover of While my guitar is excellent, really good, and so is Bodhisattva and the S. Wonder song. The rest is very forgettable, and the CD is way too short. C'mon guys now that you are independent from labels you have to give more to your fans. Looking forward to see you live in a week.BTW, the overall mediocrity of this CD fits well with the Costello parody ""detectives"". Since the artist is boring and pretentious and the song ... in the first place, there is little to lose. Costello may have actually benefited from this CD-cheers mate! (from a Toto fan)"
1,Oh dear - what a disappointment .... for these reasons,Cover versions - some just awful in my opinion - eg Could you be loved and the Motown ones for starters - some quite good and a bit like the originals - Burn down the mission and Bodhisattva - but still being two of the better tracks followed closely by House of the Rising sun and Sunshine of your love - disappointing version of While my guitar gently weeps and by time you get to track 10 Watching the Detectives then you will know it is time to remove the cd from your player - This cd is by far the worst Toto cd I have ( have them all and have done for many years) - thankfully only three songs are being played on the current tour - it is a pity that two of those three are some of the below par songs on this cd - I am pleased that the cd is so short - it is so below par.Finally - Sorry to a bunch of excellent musicians who have really let themselves down here in my opinion.
4,Throgh the Looking Glass,"I think this CD is excellent interpretations by TOTO especially taking in consideration are covers songs from theirs influences ,I love their music and was as always ,really impress by their power of interpretation and musicianship ,Steve and Bobby as the rest of the group ,Excellent!!!! Loved their show in Puerto Rico.Keep on!!!"
2,Weakest TOTO effort. These guys are better than this.,"I have been a TOTO fan since the beginning, and hold the band to a very high standard. While I certainly can't knock the talent and musicianship on the album, finding an album of cover songs was a big disappointment. Talk about setting yourself up for failure. With few exceptions, the originals far surpass TOTO's attempts at reinterpretation. These are some of the greatest songs in rock history! The renditions of Could You Be Loved, Living For The City and Sunshine Of Your Love are admirable, but the straight covers of Bodhisattva and Burn Down The Mission are best left to the original masters. And Luke, please, what were you thinking trying to do Elvis. Poor execution of what could have been a funny goof. Kingdom, Tambu, Mindfields were awesome - and now that Kimball is back, I want more original material. Not bad as a stand alone collection, but only worth two stars compared to the rest of their catalog."
1,WHY?,"Toto has been on a downhill slide, ever since their GREATEST HITS CD, back it the 80's. the group has gone from one end of the POP sound to a HARD ROCK sound. Now they are doing other artist songs. Please go back to your roots. This is not the Toto I know."
2,"Poor, poor, poor","To me it is pretty obvious.All post Jeff Porcaro albums are just pretty bad. Simon is good in his own right. But the magic died with Jeff. Mindfield was just embarrising.I saw Jeff play in clubs and as well with Toto many times. The air was just the most vibrant and Jeff IS the gruuv. Not a technical player per se. It's all heart. And hey, I'm a guitar player. I'm just putting in my 2 cents."
1,So very boring.,"I found this to be a very boring book. Yes, there are lots of mountains, and climbs, and name dropping and it goes on and on with the names, and climbs, and mountains. What are you left with but names, and climbs, and mountains? (now if that opening paragraph bored you, you definetly don't want this book!)I don't understand what these 5 star reviewers are excited about. Maybe they are all just people he recruited to write reviews for him."
1,Book with a short life.,"One has to wonder what this climber was thinking, maybe something along the lines of....How can I glorify my life and make others suffer through it with me? Or, I can't relate to others, so I'll try to explain myself. This lost sole has no footing in reality. I suppose he finds comfort in strangers patting him on the back for pushing his limits since it appears not many people who have hooked up with him hang around for long.Spirituality? Sexuality? Gerry seems confused.Whole heartedly agree with other reviewer, find a better book."
1,Real Men,There are certainly climbers who have done more challenging climbs if that is of interest. And there are climbers who have made more of their life through giving back to the communities like Sir Edmund Hillary.I guess you tend to drop names if you are more of a wanna-be than if you have arrived.
4,Good strap,"What can you say about a strap? It feels and looks like it's quality made, it's heavy duty. Supports my heavy bass better than previous straps that, while thrashing around while playing a gig, would break very easily and ruin the song. The forest green matches my bass, and it's comfortable. Also, it's pretty affordable."
3,Get what you pay for,"Its just a simple guitar strap - material is heavy duty and I've been using for about a year now, so I'm confident that the plastics and strap won't fall apart for a long time. The strap might be a little uncomfortable for some."
2,Oops wrong one,I was hoping for the original (the one where Mary Tyler Moore goes after the Tenant association that removes the hawk nest) Anyone know where that one can be found?
5,Great Edition of a Classic,"I did not expect to like this book. However, reading Life is a Dream in the original Spanish was a delight. With the opposing translation it is even more enjoyable as the occasional unfamiliar idiom or obscure vocabulary within the text was easily cleared up. And the translation itself is solid throughout.For those not familiar with the Spanish text, don't be discouraged; this is definitely the one of the most accessible Spanish classics. I would recommend it even to less advanced Spanish learners. (It's also short!)"
2,Not Good If You want to Learn Technique,"Being new to Wing Chun, this seemed to be a good book to learn something about its technique as well as its historical bankground and philosophy. Although the text presented much information on the latter two items, I learned very little on technique. The back cover makes the statement that the book ""promises to be the principal text on Wing Chun for many years to come."" I disagree. I was quite disappointed."
3,Alessandro Corbelli strikes again! Six stars for his performance!!!,"Too late did I realize that this opera was baroque...which I really don't care for. I find the music monotonous! And, I would not normally review a baroque opera for that reason. Let those who enjoy and appreciate it influence the rest.BUT, I have to comment on the wonderful performance of Alessandro Corbelli as Marcaniello. I love this guy!!! He deserves an academy award for his singing and acting. He was made to look like an old man with an artificial hooked nose, a ridiculous wig and a bad case of gout. He was hilarious! He's the only reason I watched the whole thing, which otherwise dragged on and on and on...every song sung four times at least. (I kept thinking, ""Make it stop!"")In all fairness, everything about this pastel production was first rate. The set, the costumes, the cast's singing and acting, and the music were good. It was the opera itself that couldn't be saved."
5,An Eternity of Love for a Woman!,"These writings embrace the love for a woman that no other woman could a soul be so dear. It expresses the love in every facet of a diamonds carvings which reflect the Universe and the love with nature. ""Heart Strings"" is truly a heart felt emotion and written with deep precice articulation of feelings. Looking forward to the next publication from Patrick Holliday."
2,I so much wanted to like this album...,"...I had read rave reviews and love Airey's work with Ozzy and Purple. Turns out the album is a collection of 80's sinth-pop, combined with a generic vocal performance. I hate myself for saying this, but I think it's little better than the Rocky IV soundtrack. Off the whole album, I'd probably just save the 13th track, Song for Al (reprise), a solid 80's rock tune. I don't find anything particularly pleasing in the rest of the album, but my least-disliked tracks are Balti Lament, Can't Make up Your Mind and Death Zone - Whiteout. Apparently this stuff is not my cup of tea. I'm happy to hear someone (the other reviewer and his family) appreciates it, I just wish I would too, since Airey is a classic keyboardist and Cozy Powell was a fantastic drummer. But this doesn't do the trick for me."
5,Great Stuff,Love these baits. they work wonders with all kinds of fish and really get the action going. Good baits to have around.
2,totslly Unbelievable!,"Unsigned: A Booklover's Mystery is by far the worst book in this series, and I was really looking forward to reading it. It is not only implausible, but difficult to follow or to believe. Many of the people Alex Plumtree, the hero, has trusted for years either deceive him for his own protection, or they deceive him for their own gain. The ending is completely unsatisfactory. The entire book should be unsigned!"
4,Nice package,"I've had mine for almost a year now and love it. If you don't have a DVD or 5.1 receiver yet this is a great way to get both for a reasonable price and reduce the wiring clutter of separate units. Only gripes I have are that I could have used one more audio input for the CD changer, and the remote is one big checkerboard of small buttons. You can also find more features on newer DVD player components. But all in all, this is a great deal for keeping the budget down and having one less component to fit in the entertainment unit.Go for this and Bose Acoustimass 6 speakers and you've got fantastic theater sound for a pretty reasonable investment."
3,Good introduction,"This booklet contains a series of two dozen short meditations revolving around the Jesus Prayer, its origins, and its spiritual benefits. Given that these two dozen meditations cover barely over five dozen pages, do not expect a greeat deal of detail to these meditations. That is not to say that it is a bad book. It is a good book. Just don't expect to be something that it isn't. The best use of this book would be to read a chapter as a short meditation before practicing the prayer."
3,Fun and Informative: A few outstanding Ideas,"I found some exciting pictures in this book. I would say this is a book for someone already beyond the beginner stage of watercolor. If you seem stuck on what (concepts, creative ideas, style) to do next this book will be a nice inspiration. I got it from the library and don't plan to purchase it."
2,Breakthroughs?,"An okay art book, but not the inside helpful tips i was expecting. I was very disappointed and felt it went over old material."
3,"More material was needed, it stops at 1776","I am a strong proponent of the heavy inclusion of history in the education of children. Only an understanding of the past can give us the perspective to understand the present and the future. This short book uses manipulatives to retain the attention of the reader while they are taught history. As a learning tactic it is effective, although it assumes that the reader as a very short attention span.The problem with the book is that it is too short; the last chronicled event is Washington crossing the Delaware River in December, 1776. This was very early in the war, it did not end until 1781. Therefore, while to the extent that it covers the war it explains it well, not enough of that critical time is examined."
2,Small Miracles: Extraordinary Coincidences from Everyday Life,"Very disappointing book, stories are short and where there should be the end of the stories is the authors thoughts, with lend no value to anything!"
4,Finding Coincidences,"Although I knew some of the stories in this book, it is inspiring to read them all together. And it really opens my eyes to coincidences that couldn't ""just happen"". I used it as a daily inspirational reading. I want to get other books in this series."
5,Small Miracles,"Yes, I believe in miracles. I have always felt that these extraordinary coincidences that occur were more than just coincidences. How encouraging and enlightening to read of the many ""everyday"" miracles which have occurred in other peoples' lives. Yes, God definitely is with us and speaks with us...the experiences related in this book show this to be true. They are wonderfully written and obviously carefully selected by the editors, because every single story is a blessing in itself. I can't wait to read ""Small Miracles II"" and intend to order it today."
5,Outstanding Book ...An Affirmation of Faith,Nestled between the pages of this spirited book are human stories telling truthful tales of superhuman events. Is it fate or the hand of one who loves us? Great stories for the spirit..highly reccomended to explain the unexplained in our lives and reaffirm an unconditional love.
5,This book has opened my eyes to miracles all around me.,"The book was beautiful. It has changed my life. Just as the authors promised, I began to experience my own small miracles after reading this book. I also read the stories to my students. They love them!I buy every copy I can find to give as gifts."
2,"Good, but tight SLR Cam. Tactical Case","This is a nice, water-resistant padded carry case for many SLR Cameras with standard lenses.I like a different model from Tamrac which is a little longer (for longer lenses) which also has side pockets on it. Both have space for Compact Flash cards in the front and one more small area to store in the lid. The next size up has side pockets which allow the user to store spare batteries, lens cleaners, usb cables, filters, even battery chargers.This unit is nice, but only for someone who wants to carry the bare minimum. I am a boy scout; Meaning I like to carry more. This unit does not work for me.I wish I knew the model # of the product from Tamrac I like. It may likely be the next up model in this line."
5,A Testament to the Human Spirit,Every person goes through trials and tribulations in life yet few of us can turn those dark times into something truly positive. This is a story of people who have lost more than I can fathom yet they decide to do what they can with what they have. The effect is beautiful music which undoubtedly helped many of their fellow people overcome their tragedies and also made the world more aware of their situation. It's a truly inspiring story and I recommend it very highly!
4,Valuable Insight - Less of an action plan than I'd expected,"Friendlationships by Jeff Taylor is a very quick read. I actually read through most of the book (I skipped over a lot of the F.A.Q.s chapter) in less than two hours. It's a good book to keep on your bookshelf, and I definitely recommend it for a college and post-college age group (I am in the latter, just recently). As for older adults, it can be valuable but maybe not enough. Even for me, I look forward to reading a few other books in this genre before feeling adequately educated on this subject. It's a very helpful book if you like a friend of yours, but aren't sure whether he or she likes you back. He takes a concept most people write off as sophomoric and validates the very adult reality of relationships. I recommend this to Christian adult singles as well as those in dating relationships. If you have ever considered courtship, this is a good book to keep around. Hope that helps you make a decision!"
2,The title-track is excellent!,"Ok, I heard the title on tv one day and promised myself I'd get this one. But I wish I would've downloaded it instead. Well, one of my gripes is one of the songs sounds like 59th street bridge days and I blame the producer for allowing this.Someone said Art is re-inventing himself but I hope it's only to buy more art supplies. The disc is not a total loss as tracks 1,2,3,5,12 and 13 seem to work but not always are the harmonies(voices) together---another producer error. The title track is killer and important and wonderful. (Geez!)2.5 stars max."
3,Okay but not great,"I bought this CD after hearing ""The Kid"" on satellite radio. I was almost convinced that S&G were back together again. Unfortunately, the other songs didn't live up to that one, although ""Perfect Moment"", ""Everything Waits to Be Noticed"" and ""Every Now and Then"" are nice. Unfortunately, ""nice"" is pretty much the pinnacle of my praise here. I found myself wishing the other two singers would stand down and let Art do what he does best. For some reason, what I found particularly annoying was the repetition of the lyrics in the background. (I'm just being curmudgeonly now.) And to the reviewer who complained about the driving song--it's time for you to look up ""metaphor"" in the dictionary."
5,Incredible Album,"Somebody played me the song ""Everything Waits To Be Noticed"" (the title tune) from this album and I was hooked. It's an astounding song, an astounding recording and vocal performance.Then I bought the album and to my delight, it's one of the most consistent quality albums I have purchased in a long time. I love it! ""Crossing Lines"" is another marvelous song as is ""Turn, Don't Turn Away"".And the biggest surprise is that six of the songs were co-written by Art Garfunkel. All I can say is; hey Art what kept you?, and please write more!As Rolling Stone magazine founder Jann Wenner says in the CD booklet ""In all respects, this album comes alive in a special and unique way"".Highly recommended!"
3,Mellow pop-rock,"This is a fairly good album of very mellow pop-rock which features Art Garfunkels first publicly-released attempts at songwriting , or more accurately co-writing . His contributions seem to be mainly lyrical ; unfortunately his collaborator is no Paul Simon , and any 'Simon and Garfunkelisms' here seem to be a little too deliberate and slightly disingenuous ; ie: not very convincing . Although this record has its strengths, it's always a shame when artists attempt and fail to produce 'new versions of former glories', rather than move on to create something more pertinent by simply being themselves."
4,"consistant, repeat listens are rewarding","The ?problem? with this record is that clearly Garfunkel and Co. are out to make the great lost Simon and Garfunkel album that never was. And while it is not that album, the good news is that it stands on its own as a pretty great song collection done very well.The highlight, as with any Garfunkel record, is his voice, here blended very well with others. And having some Nashville folks on board who know a good song when they hear it helps too. The album is polite, never urgent, but it is also not boring or forgettable. Days later I am still humming ?crossing Lines,? which is a great driving song. ?Thread? is also stuck, with some great lyrics.Some of the cuts here forced (?Young and Free?) and one or two suffer from weak melodies, but over all this is a great album to put on and relax to. Maybe not the new S&G; album but a damn fine attempt."
1,NOT classic Garfunkel,"I am a HUGE Garfunkel fanand cannot believe how bad this is!He must have too many 'yes' people around him and many who wrote the ridiculous reviews before me.You can barely hear his voice as he's being drowned out by these other two 'songwriters'. I listened to this through three times and this album can't figure out whether it wants to be completely mind-numbingly boring or come off with pop songs that remind me painfully of hits the The Partridge Family used to put out. I'd give it no stars if I could. Artie honey, please just sing and stop trying so damn hard to incorporate others into your act. I just want to hear him sing, like noone else possibly can.If you want to hear Art's phenominal voice...this is NOT the place to get it. Try ""Songs from a Parent to a Child"" from a few years back, THAT'S the stuff this man's made of."
4,This album is very good,"I was a serious S&G fan, and I'm one of the few people who prefer Garfunkel's solo stuff to Simon's. Loved Watermark, but haven't listened to much from Art since. This CD is great - it sounds to me like a blend of Enya and Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Very smooth, delicate, and sweet. Loved ""Perfect Moment"" and ""Every Now and Then""."
5,Works in Linux & More,"This modem kicks high gear. I bought it to put in my Win98 system. It is a hardware based modem, so it's supposed to be faster & I play some on-line games. Boy is it fast. I have never connected below 46K. Here's the great part: it has Jumpers! It's the only modem I could find w/ jumpers. It works in my new Linux system. The other cool part is a connector to use your soundcard w/ the modem so you don't need cheeesy speakers for speakerphone & voice.Highest Rating. IT ROCKS & it's worth the xtra $30 to stay away from an ISA Winmodem."
5,The best modem at an the lowest cost!,Looking for a great fast 56k V.90 modem at a reasonable price? So was I and thats when I found this baby! This Sound Blaster ISA modem works just as well as a PCI model because the difference in the ISA slot and PCI slot is that a PCI slot is better for sound and graphics. When it comes to data transfer a ISA slot will work best and using the low graphic and sound ISA slot is ideal for a modem. Don't waste your money on an expensive PCI modem or a Win-modem which will rob your computers resources. I will not go over the specs the of this thing in my review because if your reading this I am sure you read what this wonderfull modem can do! I use this modem for everything and it is reliable and FAST. Trust me this is a good buy......
4,"works good, get what u pay for","We use the Azden WR-Pro for weekly videos. They work great considering the sub $100 price. We use it in a green screen studio, at a range of about 3 to 8 meters, and havent had any reception issues. We do get some ""buzzing"" when the batteries run low, so we keep extras 9V around. Getting about 20+ hours of record time per battery change. Multi-channel works good, but we only have one audio input in our HD camera, so have to use a simple radio shack splitter to combine them into a single line, thus not allowing us to split the audio into seperate channels in production. I am surprised by the quality, as the mic does pick up a good amount of ambient noises (people wispering, chairs squeeking, etc.), so a quiet set is essential. For the price, there is NO other option."
4,Just what I was looking for,"This works great, easy to connect, good quality of sound, no problems, easy to set up and I would purchase again."
4,Great for small projects,"I have had a great experience with my mic. I do acknowledge some of the interference issues in other reviews, but paired to a hand held Kodak HD (Zi8) camera, it works great. The audio is perfect for this purpose (interviews) in contained environments. I had no problems with set-up and experienced no loss of audio pick up even when the subject was moving around in a scene. I have not tested it in very dense or noisy areas to determine range or quality problems. But for basic home video projects that allow you to get away from the camera built in mic problem this works fine."
3,Starter Kit,"I had a problem with the wash, had an allergic reaction to it. The other products were ok. I wanted to try something different but went back to California Baby"
5,Los Acosta never disappionts!,"I really enjoyed this disc and have listened to it many times. I am an ""Americano"" that likes Latin music and cumbia in particular."
4,A clearer perspective,"Terrific book, easy and clear to read, not overly critical or patronizing. Author Margaret Shepherd clearly pinpoints the traps and falls of rude conversation and aptly suggests remedies to that. So easy is it for us to be guilty of ""taboo"" behaviors and after reading this, I definitely monitored what and how I engage with others. This book is a worthwhile read, for everyone of all ages."
4,Useful in work environment and at home,"This book is helpful in stressful situation: it suggests best possible answers for difficult situations in work and at home. The book helps to be and to feel a real lady always, in all situations. It can be used for all ages."
3,"Ok, but not the best",I ordered this online and then later found a better product in Walmart. But it is ok for my 4 year old to practice his number/letter order his pen control
3,Not sharp at all,"Its a nice lightweight fixed blade and its easy t carry around your neck, though the blade design is terrible suit is not very sharp. If you need something really sharp get something else. If your looking for something that is small, compact, easy to conceal and always there for w=getting the job done then buy it. Just so long as the job does not require a really sharp blade."
3,insight...history...,"some good insight into the mentalities of the people of seirra leone and some interesting history. it's about a reality of today that compares to a reality of 2000 years ago in it's brutality and ignorance. the author tries to play up the black/white race issue a bit too much, i guess in effort to create controversy? i applause the information, the ""reporting"", but it definetly could have been edited and written better."
3,Ok,"Not much good except for a few songs (Supreme Lifestyle & Forgive and Forget), the rest of the album is kinda weak."
4,Brilliant stuf from the farm once again!,"I really do not understand why ,firstly, AAF are so unknown as they are one of the best bands anywhere - great lyrics, great guitar ,great vocals and very catchy!Also i noticed that many of the reviews rated this as worse than their previous albs or just more of the same. I totally disagree as this offers new and familiar sounds and it is a more mature sound. The guitar is wiked, esp in shes only evil. The best songs are forgive and forget, what i feel is mine, crickets and shes only evil, but theres loadz more gud there. I loved the two previous albs: anthology was v raw which i loved and i found Truant to be very clever, catchy and generally awsume.This is another to add to the collection!plz plz buy and help AAF get the credit they deserve."
4,This is a load better than ANThology,"ANThology is their only album I don't own of theirs. Most of the songs (ya know, besides the HITS of the album) are very uninspired. The non-hit songs on ANThology all sound similar, unlike their last two albums. I cannot understand what magic ANThology holds for everyone, because in all honesty it's a really mediocre album! Nice to hear though, that Up In the Attic has some variety and it works really well. The last two songs sound inspired from The Mars Volta, who is a really good band as well. Other than that, songs like Around the Block, Getting Closer, and Lord Knows builds on their formula for catchy songs. Buy this album if you love truANT more than ANThology."
2,Oh No,"What the heck is happening to Alien Ant Farm? Seeing that two members left the band, I believe that is number one. How could this album be any good without Tye Zamora? The bass practically drove the band half the time! Stay away from this album unless you like AAF's truANT. The music is very much in the same vein as the poppy tunes that came out of the band's second album. If you love ANThology, do not buy this. I am a tremendous fan of the band's first album and unfortunately, it doesn't seem like they could repeat the feat. Dryden Vera Mitchell's vocals are still great, but the song lyrics have become, well, stupid. Not quirky and smart like in ANThology. Seriously, this third attempt is more like the follow-up to truANT and not ANThology. Really. It is a boring complilation. Dowload if you have to, but don't buy."
2,"Meh, could do without","I have been with AAF since they started. Mostly, they just keep reproducing the same sound over and over again. I like them in general, but hearing the same song over and over again is pointless.I picked up this cd before it was released and found that it was kinda dry and I already stopped playing it on my ipod before it even came out. Some catchy hooks is all this cd has. No real substance though. I do love AAF but I think they could do better.If you want something better released pick up 10,000 days by tool or afi's new cd decemberunderground."
2,"""QUALITY"" not that great @ all.....","Well, thought it sounded good, but this set is ALL CHINA, and quality is poor---right from the ""blow-moled"" case, to the drill bits...poorly made, PLUS, my set came with some of the BITS MISSING, which truely cemented the idea THAT SET IS GOING BACK---there are plenty of other brands out there with a ""quick-change"" chuck KEEP LOOKING, I SAY......"
3,Drill bit set so so,"I purchased this set to accompany my new Bosch drill. The driving bits are fine but the drilling bits are low quality. When they sit in the drill they don't stay centered because the base is imperfect, but they work for rough projects. I broke one the other day drilling through a door."
3,Not interchangable,"Bought this item to replace a decreasing set of Craftsman quick change drill bits. I have three cordless drills that I'm constantly using, all equipped with either Craftsman or Ryobi quick change couplers. The drills in this set only fit the coupler that comes with the set. If you try to use them in the other brands, the drills fall out.It's nice to have the quick change ability when working with these drills and drivers, and if you don't already have one of these sets it works great."
2,OK for the price,If you want a cheap set to use on handyman projects around the house this will do ok. The driver bits are adequate but the drill bits are poor quality. The drill bits don't fit correctly in the driver and they wobble around and are hard to start without wandering.The countersink bit is a joke as I had difficulty countersinking a single screw head in a piece of walnut as it is just dull or improperly sharpened.I gave this set two stars because of low price and it is somewhat useful around the house.
1,Missed the MARK!,"This set, purchased to use with BOSCH driver, looked great. Excellent to use for ladder work. Got it up there & tried it -- could not get it to stay on spot to be drilled. The bit clearly was not straight. Got down & tried it on the ground after taking out bit -- same result. You can see several drills do not rotate as required. Returned it."
2,Too small to be of any real use,"I bought this product to use as a carrying case for maps and guidebooks while out of the country. However, it isn't large enough even to hold a small Lonely Planet guide book, and certainly no maps. Check the dimensions closely before you buy."
3,It's a hat,"Only complaint is that there is no razor sharp metal brim on this hat. Oh wait, that's not supposed to be there. Costume hat, not much to say really."
3,Definitely a cheap hat!,"I thought this hat would of been a bit better than it actually was. It's basically a cheap, halloween costume hat. If you're looking to build a decent V for Vendetta costume, you don't want this hat."
1,misleading,Be aware that the hat you will get is not an exact look like the one they have in the above photo.
4,Handy Cable,Handy splitter. Seems to work well.Beware of the Shipping though. I was charged almost $10 to ship 2 of these. They could easily have shipped the 2 cables in an envelope for 1/3 to 1/2 the cost.
4,Clarity and loud,"I have used the Fox 40 whistle for the last three years upon a recommendation from a friend. I have been very satisfied with the clarity and pitch this whistle provides. You have to blow a bit harder than a pea style whistle, however once you get used to the difference it works excellent. It will not freeze up on you in an ice arena as have some types of pea whistles. Overall I would use the Fox 40 for just about every situation."
4,Complementary readings to this book,"There are already several fine reviews, so I will only suggest reading the following works (all of them interesting books dealing somehow with the STATE) in addition to this book: 1) ""War in Human Civilization"" by Azar Gat (war explained, not just narrated); 2) ""War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires"" by the same author but far easier to read; 3) ""Understanding Early Civilizations"" by Bruce Trigger (a great comparative review of early civilizations); 4) ""History of Government"" by S.E. Finer; and 5) Political Thought: 5.1. and 5.2: ""The West and Islam. Religion and Political Thought in World History"" plus ""A World History of Ancient Political Thought"" by Antony Black."
2,"cool design, don't get it if you don't really need it","I got a palm vx and i always have it in my pocket with my keys. I got this pen b/c it fits very nicely with the palm. Since I was bring my palm wherever I go, may as well get a pen with it.The design is great, fits just like part of your palm, but the price is kind of steep. 25 buck here for a tiny pen??, i got mine for 40bucks and felt kind of rib-off. It only comes with two refills. You CANNOT get the refills anywhere!!!"
4,Good in theory...poor execution,"I like the idea of a dual action stylus...and, compared to the other ones I have purchased and looked at, this has been by far the best. I find the stylus easier to use and far more efficient...and while the pen leaves something to be desired, it's very handy for writing down quick notes. The sleek design is awesome, and it definately looks good to show off. I reccomend it to people who have problems holding the normal thin stylus and Palm beginners."
4,Other reviews miss the point !!,"I have used this stylus for the past 2 years and I have to say that I am still impressed with the design. There are countless third-party pen/stylus combo units which might be better pens, but they don't fit nearly as conveniently with the Palm unit itself. The pocket clip will fit right in the side barrel of the V and Vx models . It isn't any longer than the Palm itself so carrying it is easy. A ""regular"" pen/stylus which must be kept separately defeats the whole point of a ""bundled"" option. This is a very good alternative to the standard stylus and should be considered..."
2,Palm PalmPoint Dual Action Stylus,"I was disappointed with this item. It looks very cool, but is too expensive for what you get. The stylus is the same size in length as a regular Palm V stylus. It is thicker and has a light weight plastic feel to it. If it had been heavier, a bit longer, and had a smoother pen mechanism, I would have been happy."
1,Poor Design,"People who appreciate the funcionality and durability of the Palm unit, rightfully expect that other items put out by Palm (3-Com) should be of equal quality. Obviously, 3-Com is overwhelmed with success and is already forgetting about quality. This pen may look great in the picture, but reality is often stanger than fiction, the fiction being that this is a reliable product. If you want a good pen, look to a quality pen manufacturer like Cross. They have a pen called the DigitalDuo Writer. It is very practical, functional, and durable. 3-Com would look much better if they did their homework before putting out substandard products."
4,Good to listern classics,"The sound system is very good,bass adds more sonic to the audio, it has nice AM / FM but not good in catching the signals..CD playing qualitiy is very good."
1,disc not functioning,"sent this item to my brother in the philippines, and he told me that the disc player won,t play. he read the manual about the trouble shooting guide, ""condensation may occured, leave it open for an hour and turn it on again"" - as what the manual says. then he tried it, well, it plays the disc but after that it won't play again, then repeat the same process over and over again...BUT I LIKE TO ORDER AGAIN WITH THE SAME BRAND AND MODEL, I AM THINKING IF THE ONE I BOUGHT IS JUST NOT FUNCTIONING WELL"
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. It wasn't anything like I expected. It was more on cat care and it seemed to make things complicated. I expected it to be more of suggestions for play and comfort. Pretty dull read.Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
2,A paradoxical book for Newkirk.,"A strange book, with a curious mix of accurate information and vegan personal opinion. The good information is no doubt useful for many people, but how to distinguish it from the junk? Ironic that this book comes from the pen of the founder of PETA, an organization opposed to the enslavement of animals - even as pets!"
4,Book Helps Establish a Better Relationship With Your Cat,"I think that this book will help any cat owner who wants to have a better, friendlier, more loving relationship with their cat. I don't totally agree with all of the author's ideas, but I still think she is on the right track."
3,Information on your cat's care,"This book is information about how to travel with your cat and learn its body language written by an animal lover. It is not a list of things cats love when people do, as I had expected."
3,not a waste of money but...,"I enjoyed reading most of this book. The info on cat communication was excellent. However, the obvious intent to put most cat owners on a guilt trip for not doing exactly what the author says is at the least annoying. Also the idea that a cat will thrive on a vegan diet is ridiculous. Cats are mainly carnivorous and that means they need meat protein to thrive. Yes, cats like grass and catnip (one of mine even eats tomatoes off the vine if I don't keep him out of the garden)but a purely vegetarian diet is unhealthy. As far as cleaning the litterbox daily... well.I don't regret spending the money on this book but I feel it didn't live up to the blurb and contains some potentially dangerous information."
2,Goes a little overboard,"Although I consider myself a cat lover, I thought this book went a little overboard. The author makes you feel guilty if you let your cat go outside, or if you don't clean the litterbox every single day. She even advocates feeding your cat vegan food. The book does have some useful tips, but I didn't think it was very realistic."
3,Pretty basic,"I think this would be a terrific book for the new cat owner - in fact, I wish I had had it back when I first got my kitties. I've had cats for about 11 years now though so there wasn't much new in here for me. There were a few tidbits but now that I've readthem I'm ready to pass this book along. For the new cat mom or dad though this would be a must have since it does have some great ideas, tips and insights"
2,Outdated Material,"Although Roger Freeman is an excellent historian for the Eighth Air Force in England, and the book is an excellent reference guide, it is sorely in need of updating. The book was last updated in 1977, and since that time many things have happened to these former Eight Air Force Bases, many of which are barely visible as bases today. Pictures of ""now"" are over 25 years old, buildings are destroyed, runways overgrown with vegetation, and in some instances private industry has taken over the base thus not allowing people to visit. I strongly urge Mr. Freeman to update this book, because it is a good reference manual."
4,Cable RF DA,"Although a little pricey, this was one of the few cable distribution amplifiers I was able to find that had a sufficient number of outputs for our home. The unit is simple to install and the reverse path worked flawlessly for our cable modem service."
1,A waste of money,"The splitter worked for 2 weeks. Then completely went out, i returned it. It is a waste of time and money"
2,Poor craftsmanship,"I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this amp, but unfortunately there is not a lot of competition for this piece (that I could find) on the market. Mine worked as advertised for 13 months and then it died. I guess I will try a passive splitter for now w/out the mod inputs. The bottom line is I am very disappointed."
3,"Ignore the Movies, Enjoy the Book","From reading the first three sentences of this book, you know this is not the Elle we have come to know and love. This book is about a girl attending Bverly Hills High with no sense of fashion. She falls for the captain of the school's basketball team, and suddenly transforms the whole school, starting with the cheerleaders, and working her way through the student body. Some of the things Elle does in this book would not be possible in a real live high school, but it also does deal with some real high school issues. The plot moves along quickly and smoothly, leaving you clued in at every point. Some foreshadowing is attempted, but is easy to figure out, along with the rest of the plot."
2,"Cute, Lacks the Substance of the Original Blonde","This book is supposed to be a prequel of what happenned to Elle Woods in high school before the events in the Legally Blonde films. In the book, Elle is a girl with mousy hair and no style who undergoes a makeover.The ""Elle"" in the novel acts nothing like her film counterpart. It's difficult to place this on the same level as the film and the original novel, there is nothing the same about the two at all. Reading this book (Blonde at Heart), I cannot envision the Elle from the Blonde at Heart book being the same person in either the films or the novel by Amanda Brown. If you're a fan of the Legally Blonde films and/or the novel by Brown, skip this book, they are nothing alike. If you're not, you might be able to enjoy it as a new series about a blonde girl who develops a sense of style and has ""problems"" that don't exist in high school.Blonde at Heart may say ""Elle Woods"" on the cover, but it is not the Elle fans have known and loved in the films."
2,Memorex DVD-R discs,"The product is fine. The shipper (Office Depot) charges a shipping rate that is nearly 50% of the price of the discs. That is outrageously high and makes the product, as offered here, not worth the money."
2,Quantaray Filters are Functional,"Quantaray is the low priced spread. Mechanicaly these lens filters work. I mean they are threaded correctly. The UV and Circular Polarizer I bought both had one or two little tiny air bubbles in the glass. For most imaging you wont see these ""artifacts"" but for pros and certain phtographic applications you will at least be removing the problems with photo shop.To get no bubbles you will have to spend at least twice as much or buy Quantaray in a store and inspect them with a magnifying glass.Just for having that sacrificial UV lens filter stuck on to your expensive optically stabilized lens while you drag your DSL around Quantaray works fine. Spend more on a circular polarizer. But you should know how to use it."
4,Great ideas!,I was pretty happy with the book but it seemed to be written for an audience that doesn't have a kiln. It seems to be more for the beginner going to a studio to paint. I learned a few tricks but not what I thought was worth the cost. I saw some really nice samples from some great artists though. If I owned a studio where people came in to paint I would want this book but not just to have as a professional ceramic painter.
5,Breathtaking,Ran across the book by accident. Loved the contents. Went absolutely wild when I saw the works of Brenda Star. I wish I knew where to contact her.
4,Excellent Earth Science Guide,"Earth Science is every student's punishment. When I took the regents examination in the course the first time, I failed badly. My teacher misused all resources to teach, was poor in the subject, was an all around bad teacher and he got what came to him when 3 of the 60 people in his class passed. When I picked up this Barron's Review Book, it was everything I needed to know about the topic, better explained than standard textbooks and workbooks. This is a great review book, which got me a passing grade my second time hitting the regents. If you suffer with a subject, Barron's is a great review source, especially in Earth Science."
2,"Overall, Disappointing","I will have to say to start that I am not the biggist Mignola fan and though I have no hesitants to read one shot books I much perfer story archs over time... The art in this book is well done the story however is basically a set up for a later series. Am I interested in the later stories? Yes. But come to find out the later iterations of ZombieWorld are not written by Mignola, so no."
3,A bit of a let down...,"I recently purchased this after eyeballing it for sometime. I love Mignola's Hellboy and BPRD stuff and have been a fan of McKeown's art since he worked on Grendel:Warchild in the early 90s. That being said, I just really wasn't blown away like I wanted to be. The writing felt rushed and the characters shallow compared to what I am used to on the previously mentioned titles. I suppose if you are a diehard Mignola fan, get it, if not, you will be ok without it."
5,The best Zombie World Ever,"This wonderful example of horror comics and artwork. The plot, while not being too hard and complex, is very catchy and fun. The comic itself is very colorful about Hyperborea and the undead. I recommend this classic comic to all people who like a mystery, laugh, and, (of course!) GORE!=-)"
3,"good case, too large for my subcompact",I purchased this Tamrac case for my new Sony T7 only to learn that I had not purchased the thinnest model I wanted which I have learned is 5680. Instead this is the 5686 and almost a half inch thicker which would be fine for a thicker digital camera. this is in my drawer for now.
1,Lots of Interference,"I was going to use this to replace a mix of modulators, splitters and amplifiers. In theory - great, in application - not so great. The result was snowy modulated channels and lots of interference on cable channels that would not clear even using a low pass filter."
4,Channel Plus 3025,"Works as described. I had no problem setting it up and putting it to work. I am now able to cut down to one Direct TV Reciever for the whole house. Make sure you get a low band pass filter if you are running CATV through it, the two channels look horrible with out one."
5,simply great!,"This product is awesome! for a very reasonable price, one can process multiple video signals to multiple TV's with crystal clear images and ease. A must for any DVD, Satellite with multiple receivers, and/or CD lover!"
3,Needed more editing,"The concept behind this book is exciting. The first few chapters were well worth the read. Then it felt like a diet book where it is making the same point again and again to prove there is something behind the theory.What this book is: A good description as to how the customer/innovator symbiotic relationship propels inovation.What this book isn't: I just didn't need to be as long as it is. The point could have been made in 2/3s of the length. The repetition made it a far more academic book than the other writing style.This book is one of those where it is worth reading the first third to half and then the final chapter. It is worth reading, but not every page.Neil"
3,"Brian Moore's Review of Eric Von Hippel's ""Democratizing Innovation""","Length:: 8:18 MinsBrian Moore's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Spring 2012 Economics of Technology seminar at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
1,Worse than a science textbook,"What an awful story too much of the same thing page after page and the couple Jacob and Isabella are sappier than maple syrup. Worst part is, I have the 4 other books in the series to read! YAWN..."
5,Great story!,I loved this book. I picked it up expecting it to be another cheesy romance novel but it was much more than that. I stayed up all night reading it. This once stands out from the rest of the vampire/paranormal books I've been reading all summer. Try this one out!
3,"Too intense, not in a good way","First off, please quite writing book reports instead of reviews. I liked the concept of the story line although I found it ironic we have a successful Bella/Jacob love story after Twilight. It was irksome that the author kept going from Isabella to Bella, but overall i liked the book. I thought that there was more than enough talk of how ""intense"" their emotions and connections were. I get it, spend a page on it.... 3 is a bit much. Worth the read, the intensity will either hook you or annoy you. It annoyed me, but I still feel drawn to the series."
2,"Not a ""bad"" story if you're not expecting much","I loved the idea of the book. However I could not stand the ""heroine"". She was so annoying. I could care less about Gideon.....I read many many books in this sub-genre and both my Mom (who only got up to page 100) & I agree(our ages are 55 & 35 respectively) there's much better stuff out there with less annoying think they know-it-all ""heroines"" to enjoy."
3,Its just o.k.,Not interesting enought concept to get me to read or purchase the others in the series.
3,It's Good to be a Demon!,"Having been a fan of paranormal romance for quite sometime, it is always good to find a new series that can peek my interest. In the book ""Jacob"", the first in the ""Nightwalkers"" series, Jacquelyn Frank does just that. The world she creates for her charaters is one that draws the reader in. Frank's style is fairly common for the genre, but she twists the story in a way that makes it well worth the time and money spent."
2,Couldnh't finish it,"I didn't want to read any further than the heroine falling out of a window into the heroe's arms. That was pathetic enough in itself, but I forced myself on till I got about a third of the way in. But it didn't get any better, so I won't be reading the rest of the series, even though it looked like it might be good. It wasn't. I've read better indie books (cheaper too) - ie the Scanguards Vampires series by Tina Folson and even The Kindred Series is better than this book. Maybe the series improves but this one put me off the rest of them."
4,Jacob and Bella...hmmm...where have I heard those names before?,"I really liked this book. It think that the characters were well thought out and I love the creativity it must have taken to create an entire world. In my book, Jacquelyn Frank is right up there with Stephenie Meyer and Sherrilyn Kenyon.I was really impressed with this book and look forward to reading the others."
2,Painful,I was really disappointed in this book. I had to force myself to try and finish it. Even still I ended up giving up on it and throwing it out 3/4 the way through. The story dragged on and on and the characters were not all that interesting.
2,I'm sorry I just didn't like it!,"I wanted to. I love paranormal romances, Christine Feehan, Lora Leigh, Sherrilyn Kenyon, JR Ward but this was all over the place. I read books within hours and this book took me 5 days to read. I skimmed over large sections and just didn't care about the outcome. The dialogue was phoney and the 'love' scenes so long I lost interest. Don't buy it!"
4,An awesome beginning!,"There are plenty of reviews here that give a synopsis on this book, so I'll just toss out my opinion. I am very, VERY cautious about trying new authors. But this book came with a recommend from a few authors and readers and I finally decided to try it.And am I ever glad I did. What an intriguing world Ms. Frank has built! Jacob is a promising start to a new series and my interest has been snagged. Yes, there is room for a bit of refinement in the dialogue, but I can promise that this book held me until the final page! I can't recommend it enough. If you like strong alpha heroes, this book is for you!Excellent start, Ms. Frank! I am happily waiting for Gideon's turn!"
4,PASSIONATE,JACOB IS A VERY STRONG CHARACTOR. HE HAS A GREAT LOVE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS SO WHEN HE ALMOST LOSES HIS CHANCE TO FIND HIS ONE TRUE LOVE IT ALMOST BROKE MY HEART. YOU WILL FIND THAT THIS BOOKS HAS ALOT OF TWISTS AND TURN....READ IT ...YOU WILL LOVE IT
5,Great Read!!!,"I LOVED this book, it was hard to put down. The sory line and twist were all nice and a new take on this kind of genre,I would recommend this to anyone"
3,Good plot but yet wanting more,"I thorougly enjoy this book, however, there are a few things that people may find helpful to know before buying it. Be prepared in the first book to be clueless about the truth of nightwalker's species until the middle of the book.The author did a good job writing and has a great imagination, however doesn't do the readers justice of a preamble to discuss the races or how they interact/ live with one another."
5,Great book...Great Series,You will love this book. If you are a fan of Black Dagger Brotherhood or Midnight Breed Series then you will really love these books too!
2,A Disappointment for Me,"Hoping for a good new series, I picked this book up. Couldn't deal with the whiny, smart-mouthed ""heroine"" of the story. Nothing special about this one."
3,"Just okay... sexual exchanges were the highlights, the story was weak.","I wasn't sure what to expect from this particular author. I am a huge fan of paranormal romance, but I found this one to be a bit forced. The characters were not really all that interesting, the story line was a bit dull, and the action sequences were overwritten. I kind of think the author had about three really sexy scenes written before beginning this project and was just looking for a way to slam them all into one book. The only problem with that is, there are much better erotic books out there! This is not one I would recommend...sorry!"
3,"Wordy, verbose, repetitive","I was looking for something to ""tide me over"" until the next releases of my favorite authors/series (J.R. Ward , Larissa Ione, Kresley Cole, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Nalini Singh and Jeannine Frost) I got books 1, 2 and 3 since Borders was having a 75% off store closing sale.Frank's verbosity just kills the romance and suspension, leaving you skipping and skimming pages while thinking ""get to the point already."" However, if you can put up with Frank's wordiness, the story line itself and the characters are very likeable."
2,Demonic Harlequinn,"Imagine the stereotypical Harlequinn romance, complete with clunky, akward, yet explicit sex scenes...just add in demons. The writing is clunky and unspeakable, the characters are two dimensional at best. The villains are vague. You have no idea about the scene since unlike other authors who kill you with description, she barely provides any. To top it off, if the sex is what you're after, you'll walk away wondering if the heroine had both of her arms on the same side of her body b/c humans just can't engage in that manner...if you know what I mean. Buy it cheap or borrow it from the library. It's entertaining but there are better supernatural romance stories out there."
1,Cheessssssssy!,"I know romance novels are quite cheesy by definition but OMG! This books was beyond bad in that sense. I bought it to ease my BDB-withdrawal but the Nightwalkers series was just ridiculous and yes, cheesy. The story in itself was not bad and had some potential but the writing really wasn't anything a teenager couldn't have done. If you are considering this book, don't! Start with Dark Lover by JR Ward instead and then you'll have like 8 wonderful BDB novels to go."
2,High hopes dashed,"I really had high hopes for this series and similar to other readers, bought 3 novels at one go. Now I have a hard time just trying to finish Jacob. The premise is interesting as you don't find a lot of writers who are sympathetic to Demons. But I found it hard to reconcile that Jacob, the Enforcer, who has had centuries to hone his skills, had to rely on Isabella to save him not once but a few times. I don't like stories where skills appear without having been earned. For more than half the book, the story barely, moves with all the characters being angsty about what's going on in their culture. The sex descriptions are good (although he can't seem to get his fingers untangled from her hair!). I'll try Gideon (who really reminds you of Gregori from Christine Feehan's series) and see if I like it any better."
2,"Another so-so, not great, story","Bottom line: LoanerThis was yet another book, I really wanted to enjoy. Having never read Frank before, I was neutral.It starts off, and the two main characters sort of run into each other, fate I guess. Okay. I can believe that.But as I'm getting farther along, I'm noticing that I'm not really that captivated by the characters or the story. The book didn't have me picking it up during all hours of the day sneaking in reading, because I as the reader, was so enthralled by it.And the sex scenes were...just tepid..definitely not smokin' (which may have had more to do with lack in the character development).I'd recommend J.R. Ward, Keri Arthur (Riley series), Sunny, Kim Harrison for adventure with sex. And for mostly adventure MaryJanice Davidson, or Laurell K. Hamilton, or Patricia Briggs (Mercy series)."
3,"Good idea, good execution, bad development.","I liked the idea for the book, because it seemed different from your average urban fantasy with no vampires and lycanthropes. Jacob is a good character and fits the role he plays well. So do the rest of the demons. But Isabella..... COME ON! She comes off childlike bookworm in some of her narratives, but then all of a sudden becomes a super-girl killing everything in sight, while the all powerful and ancient Jacob falls flat on his behind every time. Also she's never really been with a man, and then jumps Jacob like a pro. COME ON! I realize that it's fantasy, but this is just too ludicrous to be remotely believable.It's an excellent idea for the book, but I just wish the writer could've made Isabella a little more believable in her role. It was impossible to relate to her and find her even a bit interesting. If you take away some of that silliness, the book could've been great."
4,More Bumping in the Night than Vampires,"Aside from the irony of a Demon being named Jacob, I found this book to be an enjoyable and quick read. I completed it in 3-1/2 hours.Written in the style of the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series by J. R. Ward, the first of the Night Walkers Series, Jacob, was a great start for a new author.The heroine was quite believable. She was down-to-earth, feisty, intelligent and the equivalent of a female ninja! Yee hawww!The hero sounded quite dashing. A bod to die for and a foreign accent to boot. He was brooding enough to be scary, quick enough to be dangerous, macho enough to be hated and protective enough to be endearing.I can't wait for the sequel."
3,"story good , but a couple of key ""twilight"" ripoffs","Although the story is quite engaging and good, I am extremely disappointed that main characters are Jacob and Bella, and that Jacob tells her that her ""Scent is....intoxicating"" to him, much like Edward tells Bella in ""Twilight"" that her scent is like a drug to him. Since this book was released a year after Twilight....I think my facts are straight......it is pretty blatant. If I am wrong....I will rescind my comments and offer humble apologies."
4,Good,"This is my first from Ms. Frank. I was surprised. I liked all the characters and will go ahead and order the second, Gideon."
4,Not disappointed,"I had read the Shadowdwellers and simply loved Rapture. So, I decided to jump over to her Nightwalkers. Even though Jacob came no where near Magnus in Rapture, I still was pulled into the character of Jacob. The book was a quick read meaning that I could get nothing else done while reading this book. It was a book hard to put down. I saw some others with derogatory reviews but I look at a book in which I wish to escape, have my heart beat a little faster and simply fall in love with the characters. This book did all of that and more. I cannot wait until I start with her next book in this series. Since I loved the Shadowdwellers, I ordered all of the Nightwalkers series and can't wait to move on."
4,Whatta Man!!,"I heard about Jacquelyn Frank from a friend and I decided to check out the Nightwalkers series.Jacob is the first book in the series. He is one of the elder demon also known as the Enforcer; whom others at time fears him. Isabella meets Jacob one night while he was searching from someone.From the moment he saved her when she fell, things started to Heat up.... and boy was it hot. As the story progresses we find out more about Bella and Jacob.. Those two can barely keep their hands off each other. they are quite passionate beings.This book reminds me sort of the BDB series a little and I like it.Besides the grammar issues it was still a good read."
3,"Good Ideas, but...","The premise of the story is sort of different -- Good looking Demon heroes protecting their secret world and the world at large. Ok fine. Where I had a problem with this book was that its narration and dialogue was repetitive -- from the explanation of Demon politics/history, to the personality quirks and mannerisms of the characters, I felt like the author ran out of things to say and found it necessary to keep driving home points that had been made already."
1,HORROR AND DINO FANS BEWARE,"Various species of dinosaurs start appearing in the Florida everglades and attacking those in their vicinity. Sounds like my kind of book. Unfortunately, what the book really focuses on is people reverting back to their primal state and running off to join a lost Indian tribe deep in the glades. No, that's not a joke. I had some high hopes for this book and those hopes now lie six feet under and what could have been a great ""dinosaurs attack"" story turned into a hideous waste of time and money."
5,It aint no JAWS rip-off,"Ever since since I saw the cover for this book, which features a mean looking alligator head with trickles of blood drippin' out the mouth, I've loved it. Got at this new used bookstore called ""the bookshelf"" for 2 bucks. And it was well worth it. My favorite part is when that ranger nmed Juan gets it! But I spoil you on how he gets it. It's just gory. You can read Juan's death right before the story. I'm just saying that THIS,BOOK,ROCKS. That's all I will say."
3,pushing perfection,The Birthmark written by Nathaniel Hawthorne examines the need for the main character to always be perfect. He tries to make up for his less then perfect self by changing the one quality that is not perfect about his wife. This has a very sad ending. His obsession for being perfect is what was his doom in the end. It was a good book to read and I recommend it. It has a conflict between nature vs. science.
1,Out of Business,"Unless you do not plan on ever returning this drive to Mad Dog for service, do not buy this or any other product from Mad Dog. I sent my DVD recorder to Mad Dog for service and never got it back. As far as I can tell,they have gone out of business. If you look up their website, you will find that it no longer exists. Go buy another brand of drive from a company that is still in business."
4,these are fun and durable,My son enjoys watching these roll around and seeing the animals swish from side to side. They are a great addition to the Roll-a-Rounds Jungle Friends Treehouse.
4,It's the genuine filter,"It's a furnace filter. It's the same one that they installed with my furnace. It works, I change it once a year.I'm not sure if my allergies are better since I installed the better filter. I'd say it at least helped. Also, I like not having to change the filter all the time."
2,Air Filter,This air filter is exceptionally good. Lasts for an extended period so I don't have to change the filter as often.
4,"good book, not for beginners",This is an excellent book with fine historic background. Do not assume that this is for beginners though. The old style german is probably better for intermediate to advanced readers.
4,Unterhaltsam,"Das Buch ist nicht schlecht fuer jemand der noch viel Hilfe beim lesen braucht und in der englischen Uebersetzung nachschauen kann wenn es Probleme gibt. Die Geschichten sind unterhaltsam. Die Sprache ist zwar etwas altmodisch aber die Unterschiede zu modernem deutsch sind nicht so gross das dies ein ernstes Problem waere.Ebenfalls gut gefallen haben mirSagen und Legenden (German Edition)undDie schönsten Weihnachtsmärchen der Welt: Christmas Fairy Tales in German (German Edition).See my list ""Great German Books""."
3,gift,bought this book for a 70 yr. old woman who is doing the Rosetta Stone german program. She seemed thrilled with this item. She is learning a second language to fight off memory loss.
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"In reading the title and the brief snapshot of the book before buying, the book appeared to promise a good reading experience. However, it turned out to be a very disjointed, hard to follow, not even 'believable' story."
1,LloydInSocal,"The Book I bought is only one fifth of the ""series"" or complete Book that has been reviewed by some. I got ONLY Book 1 (of 5 or more) that I would retitle: ""How to play songs with one finger on each hand"". And that covers all 48 pages of the Book. It's fine for ""starters"", I suppose, but it looks to me like it defintely demands the other 4 ""Books"" to be worth it -- and I did not see those offered."
3,Not what I was looking for,I was hoping for more detailed descriptions of the First Council of Nicaea. The book is a compilation of Catholic doctrine. It does not discuss the doctrines with a critical eye. It appears to have been written with a Catholic seminary student in mind.
4,Droll yet informative.,"While the writing style is somewhat tedious, this book is helpful in laying out some of the controversies in early Christian doctrine. It does not cover all the significant situations of late antiquity, but the narratives of the histories that it does address are useful in portraying a proper context, especially in regards to the Arian controversy and Pelagius."
3,Why America Wins Wars,"This was a very good book. I got it in a timely manner, and my freinds enjoyed discussing the book."
1,Propaganda,"The author is about as good of a historian as Bush or Cheney: facts don't matter to him or them; it's all about PR and saying what your base wants to hear. Look, you can't make war on ""terror."" Terror is a tactic and a strategy, not a thing or a group upon which you make war. So how can you win such a ""war""? Regarding American ""victories,"" U.S. policy went down to defeat in Vietnam, Korea, and the War of 1812. It's going down in flames in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what serious historian would describe himself or herself with an ideological label--""conservative"" in this case? That hardly instills confidence in his objectivity. A real conservative or liberal of integrity would acknowledge both the good and the bad of the past and learn from it."
3,"Good music and dancing, bad story","This is the first Hindi movie I ever bought. If you like hindi music and dancing, you'll love it, but after watching it once, you'll probably watch only the music sections in the future. The story is simple.. I just wonder how can anyone make an almost 3 hours movie out of such a simple story.What is completely unforgivable is the fact that in the second part of the movie they try to make us think that they are in Italy when they are actualy in Hungary!! This is absurd and insulting: do the film makers think that we all are stupids??? How can they show hungarian typical dances and dialogues in hungarian language when they are suppossed to be in Italy. And further more, where was the Colisseum and all those monuments that characterize our image of Italy????I give to this movie three stars for its music but just a half star for its story and production."
1,Wish I never bought it,"I also bought this for my newborn. It doesn't matter how many times I take his temp, it comes out different every time. NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
1,Inaccurate,"I got this thinking that it would be more comfortable for my children while taking their temperature. It has never worked. First, you have to put on these little covers before using it and they break almost instantly. Then after going through all the preparations for use, the stupid thing does not give an accurate reading. It says one temp for one ear and a different one for a different ear. And if you try it a third or a fourth time for some kind of accuracy it will give you other readings. It is horrible. I would reccomend a regular arm thermometer."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this for my 5 month old and when he was sick with a fever, this thermometer was TOTALLY USELESS. My child was burning up.....you could feel him being hot by touching him and this thermometer gave a reading of 100.6. The reading was NEVER the same twice or more times when I took it. ANd when I took his temperature with another thermometer (rectal)....ie the rectal temperature was 102!!! He clearly had a fever but this thermometer did not pick that up. Talked to my pediatrician and was told that ear thermometers are not accurate for infants less than 1 year old......so if you have a baby less than 1 year old....take the rectal temp....its the most accurate. This ear thermometer does not give the same reading even when the reading is taken in the same ear within 1 min......and its not at all accurate. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!!"
1,Not Reliable!!!!,"I have never gotten this thermometer to work correctly. And I'm not convinced that the fever miraculously changed by the time I got to the pediatrician's office. Since I was initially suspicious when it always gave a reading of exactly what the last reading was before changing to a new reading on the second try, I compared it to an under arm regular thermometer reading. It never matched. I will be tossing it and getting a better brand."
5,a must have for anyone with a baby,"Absolutely necessary for babies and little ones, it can work on adults too, but it is perfectly sized to fit in those little ears, and you get to know the temp in one second. It is accurate in comparison to the larger adult ones used on children. If there is barely a fever, it may not show up on this, but if it is bad, you will know it, when you need to know it! Great shower/new baby gift."
1,brought it back before i ever used it,everyone told me how bad these thermometers were. I never used it. i have a digital one and take a rectal temperature. I hate having to do that to my son but it is the most accurate. If you fo get a digital and do rectal be warned that the first few times a little or a lot of poop may some out. I wish someone had told me about that!
5,One in a Million,"How do I describe this sci-fi/horror/sociological/scatological freak show of a novel? Well, if you're read the brilliant cyberpunk classic *Neuromancer*, you know the plot, more or less. *Empire ...* is part tribute to, part parody of Gibson's work. But let's say we were living in an alternative reality in which Gibson lost his only manuscript of *Neuromancer* before he could get it to the publisher, and who should find it but the crazy, mystical, beatnick author William Burroughs. Burroughs then says 'wow, this is quite a story, but I've got a better take on it,' drops some acid and gets right to work. Lets say, then has the worst bad trip of his of while writing. The result would look somethink life Acker's ultra-violent topsy-turvey future world in which France is a colony of Algeria, wars are fought with sound waves and burned out, amoral adventurers stride through the techno-babble wasteland of a doomed civilization in search of money, drugs, revenge and just to escape boredom."
4,thriumph for Gruberova!,"I would have given this DVD of Norma five stars, except for the fact that the production was bordering on ""Euro-Trash""!!! The duets between Gruberova and Ganassi were worth the price of the DVD!"
5,A lifesaver - LOVE it!,"I have severe dry eye, and can lo longer even read an 11 pt font without a magnifier. This Bible has been a LIFESAVER! I LOVE it, love it, love it!! Thank you SO much Holman and Lifeway!!!The Hcsb audio read by David Payne is also a WONDERFUL accompaniment to this."
5,This IS Giant Print,"This is the Holman Christian Standard Bible in 14-point Giant Print. A joy to behold! Although I do not need giant print, I prefer it, and this fills the bill. Unfortunately, the edition is not available in Genuine Leather, but it is bound in South Korea, so the book does have a sewn binding, as all Bibles bound in South Korea do. That is quality. Most American-bound Bibles are glue-bound crap(you should excuse the expression).This particular Bible I am reviewing has thumb-indexing, which I cannot abide and do not recommend to anyone, especially new Bible readers, else they will never learn on their own the placement of the various books. This Bible gets my highest recommendation. The only thing it lacks are book intros and a Harmony of the Gospels. But---easy on the eyes it definitely is, and the HCSB is a remarkably accurate translation, AND easy to read, as well.(It is more accurate than the NIV). But, try to get one without the thumb-indexing."
5,Bibles,My husband and I read different versions every year and this is a good version if your into reading different versions like we are.
4,Good Reading Bible,"I run a Bible study at my local church and was looking for some good reading Bibles (not study Bibles--which include commentary). This edition of the HCSB is one of the reading Bibles that I found (I prefer multiple translations to be used in a Bible study). Overall, it is a good edition with very large font (which makes for extremely easy reading--no eye strain for older (and younger) readers), little commentary (except translators' notes, which I appreciate), and full-color maps (maps are always good). That said, this edition does have a downside in that the cover is somewhat cheap--cardboard wrapped in faux leather--and this may be an issue if you are looking for a long-lasting Bible. For my purposes, a year-long Bible study, this edition is perfect."
2,Not satisfied,"I am not satisfied with this product. I have seen many ""imitation leather"" bibles, but this one is just plain cardboard that looks like leather. It's very stiff and very fragile. The only way to see the product was to remove the plastic wrap, so now I can't return it either."
1,"works, but destroys itself if given certain IR inputs","The RF DA function works just fine. The other function is to repeat IRinputs from DA outputs. This unit burns itself out when an IR sensoris exposed to IR noise. - - It's one thing for it to not work in the presence of noise - I can see that - but it burns out! - That's a design error. Tech support insulated me from engineering instead of allowing meto work with them, which I was happy to do. (I'm an electrical engineer)Instead, they gave me silly things to do like installing a surge suppressor and another power supply.They never acknowledged the problem, but gave a 'modified' unit to try. Beware if you depend on the IR function. This might be a company that just markets devices that are designed offshore and don't have significant internal technical competence."
1,Flawed Technology,I have used this device in an IR repeater system for 5 years. The original unit expired and I ordered a replacement. This unit is equipped with an internal breaker/reset feature. I installed the unit and attempted to access my equipment through IR. It kicked its breaker and never woke up. This technology is too weak to be sold. I just paid $160 for a paper weight. Sorry Channel Plus but you have lost my business forever. The concept of IR commands through coax is compelling but the hardware is too fragile.
4,Good little vacuum,This vacuum works very well. It is very convenient to use for small spills since you don't have to haul it out and plug it in. Great idea.
1,Form WAY OVER Function,"I bought this because my wife thought it looked really cool. She hated it more than i did. It is noisy (a lot noisier than the replacement I bought), awkward to hold and use because of the handle-less design. The exhaust blows down onto the floor where you are cleaning and blows lighter debris away before it gets sucked up. Some folks reviewed and said it looked like a piece of design artwork in their house; it might look cool if your house was designed like a spaceship. I returned this to Amazon."
4,Champagne Kone,"I gave this as a gift for Christmas and they loved it. So stylish and compact, always ready when needed. Just place in the corner and it becomes a mini sculpture."
3,Should have been modeled better.,"This vacuum is nice looking, has good suction power and the charge lasts for as long as I need it. But, as other's have mentioned, the fan from the motor blows down. So, while the vacuum is trying to suction things in, the fan is blowing them away. The design should have been much better, as not to let the fan blow downwards. You pretty much end up chasing dustbunnies around, until you can get them cornered."
3,Doens't live up to all the hype.,"I recently purchased the Kone for our office. My husband wanted something he could just pick small things up with. The kone seemed like a good fit because it doesn't look like a vaccum. However, what they don't tell you is that it is really loud and doesn't have a lot of suction. It is just o.k. for me."
3,How important is the look?,"We bought this vac for cleanups around the woodstove; (just ashes and small mess everytime we put in wood) needed something to leave out and loved the look! It does look great; works o.k. but it isn't nearly as powerful sucking as it sounds! (try putting your hand over end) The biggest downside is that the air vents are located too near the sucking end; thus blowing fine stuff away before it can vacuum it up. I will keep it, as for now it is the only thing I saw available to leave out all the time, hopefully Black and Decker could improve on the vent placement and perhaps increase actual vacuum power."
2,"""A"" for looks, ""F"" for ergonomics and performance","The first thing that struck me as odd was the handle - which there is virtually none. You grasp the product by the top of the cone which is awkward and slippery, especially for someone with small hands, like me. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to keep a tight hold on it while vacuuming up a mess with weight - such as cat litter. You cannot turn the unit on/off with the same hand you're holding it with. The on/off button is at the tip of the cone, which is at your wrist while the cone is in your hand, so you need to use your other hand to operate the button. Finally, as others have written, the exhaust blows around more stuff than the unit actually picks up. I plan to return mine as well. I'd rather have an ugly, but useful, unit hanging on the wall than deal with this inferior excuse for a hand-vac."
5,Kone Cordless vac,"Great design, powerful hand vac. Great for quick small jobs, used it to vacuum my car thoroughly and just hit the slowdown point after about 30-40 minutes."
1,pay attention to negative reviews,"1. no attachment-so, you can clean a 1 inch circle at once (how convenient is that?)2. It is heavy and smooth and cone shape! This does not make for a comfortable, secure grip (the other kinds a toddler could use) I don't get the good reviews!!!!!!!!good for ... cracks in car seat."
3,"Looks like a witch, cleans like a devil!",My Kone gets daily challenges from dog hairs and plant sheddings. Its power does the job well.
1,Is less than 1 star an option???,"This is one of the worst hand held vacs ever made. Sure it may look nice (and not even that nice), but all it does is blow the crumbs and dirt around before you can suck them up. I think the folks giving it such good reviews must clean without looking, or else they think it has done its job when in fact it has just blown the dirt to another part of the room. I much prefer to pull out my full size vac or use my 10 year old B&D Dustbuster, which works soooo much better. Save your $$$."
3,Sleek design,The looks of this vacuum are very sleek and the colors offered are very nice but the opening is not very big and it doesn't seem to hold as much debris as the Dust Buster. Between the two I would purchase the Dust Buster.
4,"Kone is great for small, light messes but lacks power","I ordered this product to take care of the litter and food my cats get all over my kitchen. My old hand vac takes a long time to get out, plug in, put the right nozzles on, and use. I wanted the Kone so that I could have something always ready and available to clean up those small daily messes and it delivers. It does a great job of cleaning up cat litter and small pieces of food and hair on the tile and the carpet in my kitchen area! I am very impressed with the look and ease of use of this product. The only drawback that I have seen since using the Kone a few months now, is that it lacks much power, so sometimes you have to go over an area several times to get everything. Plus it has to be held at the right angle to the mess to get it all up as well. BUT these are easy to overlook when I use it daily and it does just what I needed it to do! :)"
4,Love it!,"This works great, although it is a bit loud and has a strange shape (sometimes hard to hold), but I'm very happy with the purchase."
2,Suction was great... before it stopped working,"Worked great, despite the air blowing out from the middle of the device. As long as you aimed it so that it didn't blow air where you were trying to vacuum, it worked. Never had a problem with the battery holding a charge either. But then one day it just stopped turning on. If I hit the power switch about fifty times, it would eventually turn on and stay on. But it's annoying to have to hit the power switch fifty times every time you want to vacuum up a little mess."
1,It just glitters..its NOT gold!!!!!!,"I did not buy this item over Amazon.com.However, I would like to write a genuine review of this item so rest other do not get swooned over its chic looks.As I said, looks wise its very good; you can even keep it in your living room...BUT:1. This is SO LOUD that my next 4 door neighbor would also know when I am using it.2. Its not very user friendly when you want to put it back on the charger latch..... I mean you have to get hang of it!!My advice== Window-shop other products don't waste your money on it."
3,"It's ok, nothing great. Not for pet hair.","I received this as a Christmas gift and I looked forward to using it. It did ok on dust and other easy to pick up stuff, but not with Cat hair. I know it's just a handheld but I can go over and over the same area of fabric on the couch or chairs and it still doesn't pick up the cat hair. I'm better off using the lint rollers than this."
1,Three times zero = -$120!,"I'm going to spend the same amount of time writing this review that Dirt Devil spent designing this fiasco. If anyone can recall the first dust busters that sucked up little and spewed it right back out through a piece of cheesecloth called a filter, you will be painfully reminded by that trip down memory lane. Ok, I lied, I spent a two minutes reviewing this product-BTW, the B&D; 18v unit is light years ahead!AX~"
2,HOPE THIS IS THE EXCEPTION,"I ORDERED THIS VACUMN TO PICK UP THE SMALL MESSES THAT MY CATS MAKE WITH LITTER OR FOODS. SO IT DOES GET USED 2-3 TIMES PER DAY EVERYDAY, BUT ONLY FOR MAYBE 3-5 MINUTES IF THAT, AND I HAVE CHANGED THE BAGS REGULARLY.SO NO MISUSE. AFTER ABOUT 4 MONTHS IT ISNT WORKING VERY WELL. BY THAT I MEAN AFTER YOU TURN IT ON YOU HAVE MAYBE 30 SECONDS AND YOU CAN HEAR ITS POWER START TO DIE. I AM HOPING THIS IS THE EXCEPTION AND NOT THE RULE TO THIS VACUMN, BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED IT AT FIRST."
2,Sufficient -- until it dies,"Decent enough hand vac, not too ugly to have around. Not exactly something to put on the mantle either. But fashion doesn't make good form - it was a bit unwieldy to handle. Still, I didn't complain. Until less than two years after I bought it - and it stopped holding a charge. So, if you want something cheap that you can use for about a year, go for it. I don't have experience with other, better products."
4,good,works goodhave a spare filter so you always have a clean one around.make sure the cordless unit u buy allows you to change the battery easily. i'm not sure this one does
1,"Nice stylish look, poor performance",This has a nice design and can be stored in public view without being a sore site. But that's where the pros end. The motor starts going after a few short months and the vacuums suction deteriorates.
1,Fisher falls flat,"this poor choice will haunt me until i can stomach buying a new VCR. the user interface, remote or otherwise, is terrible. compared to my older SOny, i've made a horrible choice. very hard to program simple recordings. won't even default to today's date, time, and channel. sad to say you get what you pay for."
2,Unsure about Teknoman,"To be honest, I expected it to be like the episodes I saw on UPN in 1995. But this was a little different. The transformation narratives only happened once- first for Blade's original transformation in the pilot episode, and for when he used the teknobot in ""Snapshot"", and the opening credits weren't what I expected. I'd rather hold onto the memories than recommend something that other people might be disappointed with. Aside from those little things, it's okay."
1,Uchuu no Kishi Tekkaman Blade,"Yes, it's the name of the original series. Teknoman is a horribly edited version in the US. Don't waste your money in this piece of garbage and get the original version (Maybe on Ebay)..."
5,THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the international edited dubbed series of teknoman and i don't know why people dont like it. i have seen both the japanees version and this version and i think this teknoman version is better then it hands down.
5,Stunning,"A peerless performance from one of America's finest and most thoughtful formalist poets. It is most sad that John has died, but we can treasure this superb volume of tight, exquisite lyrics on the great themes of life and thought. Finlay's exact and lyrical writing is to be savored for a long time. ""A Prayer to the Father"" might be one of the most haunting small poems ever written by an American. Finlay was a theist and a student of the great Yvor Winters, so, if you know theism and Winters, you can probably guess some of his themes."
3,No real bonus content.,Movie is good but the bonus content is lacking. Could movie fir girls who love soccer. Boys may not find it interesting enough.
5,Gracie,This was based on a true story. The main character is why girls soccer has a league of their own. The main character in real life plays the mom in this story which I think adds to the movie.
3,Gracie,"This movie is by no means a little girl movie. It has way too much mature subject matter (sex, drugs, alcohol, and etc...). That being said, it stayed true to its real life events (that most of us would rather have left back then) events of 1970 era.This is not a movie to watch if you want to learn new ground breaking sills, techniques, drills and insight for soccer. Sadly, the over-the-top recreations of the lack of girls sports and the reactions of the boys (and worse yet the way her female contemporaries treat her as well!) is thrown in your face.This is a movie to see if you want to learn about the spirit of one special girl's heart to succeed in soccer after the tragic death of her brother.Thanks for reading.Tim"
5,Great eco-friendly clothes washing detergent,I really like this clothes washing detergent.....it works very well on all our clothes & is great on cloth diapers also!
5,Great Laundry Soap,"I've been using this laundry soap for years. Fragrance-free, no garbage, no nasty chemicals, does the job."
1,Left blue spots,"We really wanted to like this detergent, really, but it would leave blue spots and grease marks on our clothes We have a front loading GE machine and our water is soft due to a water softener. We tried even getting a new washer, but still the blue spots. Our plumber is one who clued us in that was the detergent. We don't use fabric softener or any detergent with any dyes. Our daughter did do well with the detergent - she has extremely sensitive skin. But the loss of clothes was just too much"
1,Harshest detergent i've ever used,"This detergent is incredibly harsh; it has caused stretching, fading, and unraveling of my clothes. I have noticed with jeans and towels, especially, that the fabric feels almost starched, it is so stiff and brittle. And the brittleness has led to very premature break down of the fabrics. I noticed that any kind of elastic in my clothes, or clothing with spandex in it, became lax and is essentially ruined. I will never use this detergent on anything but old towels and things I do not care about. It says 'heavy duty' on the bottle and that does not equate to appropriate care for any clothing items that are valued."
4,Good Detergent,"I love this ""green"" product! It really does a great job cleaning my laundry without any perfumes or additives - I have very sensitive skin and I have had no problems. I feel like I am helping the planet as well! You still need to use stain release products for stained clothing, but for general cleaning it does the job!"
4,"It's OK, but cap needs improvement","For a green detergent, it does its job, but needs a few improvements. Compared to some of the other non-green detergents, it doesn't clean as well or as thoroughly, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. My major caveat comes from the cap that it comes with - it has very faint marking lines inside showing how much to use - the typical user might fill the entire cap without ever noticing the lines. However, if you're doing that, you are using far, far too much detergent. I don't like things that make me use too much detergent (thereby increasing my cost per load significantly). It should do a better job on whites, which I find still need some bleach to get really clean and eliminate small stains."
5,Church and Nonprofit Guide,"Bought thru Amazon , excellent book , covers a lot of needed info , answers a lot of questions"
5,Loved this book so much breathlessly awaiting a second from author!,"I was so surprised by this book. It was very real, (as it turned out, autobiographical) filled with real information and real teachers, real toys, real searching for information on ""what is porn?"" As someone who sells sex toys for a living at home parties, I did not know if I would get much out of this book, but I loved it on so many levels, including educational and entertainment.The author creates a list of things to do to learn about porn to prove to her boyfriend at the time that she is not porno-phobic. Instead she dumps the boyfriend and learns about her self, her sensual self. The information is accurate and exciting to have at your fingertips. I just wanted more from her.The detailed information in the resources list at the back is my new best friend, taking me on further journeys.If you would like to know more about things sexual, don't hesitate to purchase this book and learn as the author learned, by trying it!"
1,Demeaning to Women,"The book is ridiculous, i ordered it for my mom for Christmas, thinking it would be nice, it has sayings in it such as: A daughter needs a mom to teach her how to become a good wife, a daughter needs a mom to teach her how to fix her hair. And by the way its written by a man, who is neither a mother or a daughter."
5,Great Book,"I gave my mom this book and this-""Mother I Cherish You"" Heartwarming 8x10 Quotes About Mothers, Double-matted in Ruby Red/white and Surrounded with Real Flower PhotographyBoth of them went together very nicely"
4,Cupcake wrappers,"This is not really a toy, as they review stars are questions for toys.However, they are great cupcake wrappers and shipped quickly."
3,The Making of Star Trek,"Interesting information, though under the strict approval of Gene Roddenberry, the producer. The candor can be surprising, though this reading should be balanced by other work on the subject. Recommended that it be read with 'Inside Star Trek', by Justman and Solow. Interesting for those going into the media field."
3,"Buen disco, aunque no el mejor","Este disco tiene buenas canciones, ninguna como para decir que pondría entre las top 10 de Cristian, o Christian como ahora escribe su nombre, sin embargo el disco se hace escuchar y tiene sus luces pop y algún ligero toque de rock.Las mejores canciones de este disco son: (por supuesto desde mi punto de vista)Simone (dedicada a su entonces recién nacida hija)Abrazado a tu piel (con un toque rockero)Amor total (balada)Amor eterno (popera)Dinamita (una canción pop, bastante divertida)"
5,Para Christian son verdaderamente Dias Felices...,"Este es un disco muy bueno y, en parte muy diferente a los que fueron editados cuando Christian era parte de BMG. Creo que Cachorro Lopez y Christian encontraron una mezcla de sonidos que no tienen nada que envidiarle a discos como Lo Mejor De Mi, Mi vida Sin Tu Amor, Azul y Hoy quiero Soñar. La mejor de las suertes para Christian con su nueva familia, su nueva disquera Universal, y el disco. Seria algo interesante ver una produccion de Christian en Concierto con todos sus mas grandes exitos, asi como lo suele hacer cada vez que se presenta en Viña del Mar."
1,Did Not Help Reception.,"I bought this antenna for my Uniden hand-held scanner. I thought it would help reception... It did not. In fact, reception was terrible. Maybe the antenna is defective? Maybe this Cobra CB antenna does not work on a Uniden scanner? In any case, but I am sending it back for a refund. Will not try again."
4,Antenna Review,"The telescopic antenna works nicely on all of my handheld CB radios. Does seem to add extra range for the radios. Overall, it is a very nice product."
2,Might be better ones out there,"Ok So i'm pretty much new to the whole CB thing and decided on a midland 75-822 and this antenna. As mentioned in a previous post, the antenna feels a bit loose and it didn't make too much of a difference when compared to the stock antenna that came with my unit. Again, i'm new and maybe its just the area I'm in but the range was not good at all."
1,China junk!!!,It wobbles at the connection where the whip is crimped to the screw stud. It's a crimped on connection and it was loose the day i got it. It'll only get worse since it's already loose.. $20.00 for this?
2,decent,"Adds height for longer range but the quality leaves a bit to be desired. It appears that there is a wire held in place by heat shrink, but it should be soldered for better connection."
2,Poor,I dont know about anyone else but this picks up less then the org antenna. it is lang and very heavy makes the my hand held fall over all the time!! i wouldnt get this again!!
2,Works as Claimed,"Took this out into the wild on a Jeep excursion last summer and the reception is okay, but nothing great, even with an upgraded antenna. It will definitely interrupt your radio signal if you have your radio on, so that's kind of a bummer.It's better than nothing, but I'm not thrilled with the product."
3,product i just received,"is this antenna i just received a true cobra brand antenna for the cobra handheld i just bought. The antenna i just received came in a clear bag no labels or nothing. Just making sure im paying for a name brand product, also quality."
5,great range!!!,"i took of the stock antena and put this antena on the cb radio and it got so much more range, very well made. GREAT FOR THE PRICE!!!!!!!!"
4,Scorching versions of some Neil classics!!!,"I must admit I bought this CD with some trepidation having been a Neilophile for over 30 years but the majority of these artists do more than justice to the man's songs and some even up the ante a fair degree. I've only heard of a handful of these guys (notably Steve Wynn, Chris Cacavas, Van Christian, & Rich Hopkins & Lumanarios) but the musicianship is consistently excellent. This is a great compilation for folks just getting introduced to Neil's music and a real hoot for old fans. Don't know whether he's had a chance to give it a listen but I think The Old Man would be pleased. Far superior to the Bridge tribute released about six years ago. Give it a listen!"
2,Only of little value,"I bought the tape to listen to and see if it was something to add to our homeschool library and also whether it was something I would recommend to the university model school our older children attend. Although the resource is child-friendly for the lower elementary ages, there are far better books available to give a student a taste for Ancient Egypt's history of its pyramids. David MacAulay's book titled Pyramid would be a much better use of time. MacAulay's book is full of detailed drawings that a child could sit and ponder - good for their attention span. For literature I would recommend Jill Rubalcaba's A Place in the Sun and Eloise Jarvis McGraw's The Golden Goblet. Golden Goblet is of a higher reading level than A Place in the Sun and will give a richer, fuller look into the values and way of life of the Ancient Egyptians."
3,subjectivity and power,"Ransom gives a well-written and knowledgable (especially for a poly-sci prof) account of the necessary distinction between politics (power) and the self, and the erroneous conflation of the two in traditional democracy as well as in bad readings of Foucault. Foucault spent much of the time writing from the perspective of power on the self, but the unanswered and crucial question is from the perspective of self on power - possibilities, realizations, implications, etc. Given the title I thought Ransom would give some interesting indication of a direction of investigation. He doesn't. He most often rehashes typical talk of 'care of self' etc. Nothing too illuminating. But then again, if you're not too knowledgeable on this, it might be of help."
3,"Reading ""foucault""!","Foucault has been afflicted by some misunderstandings of him. The implication of ""critique"" of power is one of them. Ransom, in this book, makes clear the Foucauldian sense of crtique and that of disciplinary power beyond sovereingty. But this book is , more or less, confusing and doesn't make a clear distiction between discipline and governmentality( or pastoral power)."
4,Good Enough,"I just received mine. Here are some observations:1. The cases come in 5 lovely translucent colors.2. The CD is held in place by 3 cusps. You can release the CD with minimal stress on it by depressing the central hub.3. There is some clearance between the base of the case and the CD surface.4. The plastic of the cases seems to be brittle.All these mean that the cases will protect the CDs from scratches but they will not last forever. This may be a problem if the cases were intended for active use. Otherwise, they are good enough."
1,Sure they're cute BUT......,"Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE!!"
1,Amazon doesn't have these in stock,I ordered these 2 months ago and Amazon still does not have any in stock. It says that they are available in 24 hours but they have told me several times that they can't get any.
1,electronics fan,"Somehow, on the way from China to Amazon to Me, eight of the 25 became cracked on the frontal part. Unusable! Really cheap plastic. I would like to mail CD's to friends, but am afraid they would shatter in the mail. Also there are no means of labeling them unless you use ""Post-it-Notes"" or a Magic Marker."
4,good,"i bought this for my pry bars, it work the same as the mac or snapon , for the price it still fine."
3,Cable Amplifier,This is a bidirectional amp that will work with a cable modem or two-way set-top boxhowever it lacks a variable forward gain adjustment. It can be overloaded if the inputsignal is too high but is useful if you install it after several splits so theinput signal is weak. It has an external power supply which connects to adedicated f connector on the unit. It would have been more useful if youcould power it with a power inserter on the same output coax that has theoutput RF signal.
1,Kept hoping for more to these card-board cutout people.,"Disappointing! Should have realized an autobiography by a twenty-something probably would not have much depth. While this sounded like the story of a troubled family, it was too much a story of the usual teenage insecurities that we all have gone through. Throw in a mentally ill sister who seems to be superflous to the author's story of HERSELF. How many pages can you write about yourself without developing the other characters in the family. A ""good"" sister and ""bad"" sister is not what this family was about. It could have been good to develop the real struggle of a mentally ill person at a time when it was still a stigma to be one (I guess it still is in our society). Bottom line - was a white bread, bologna sandwich with mayo - could have been multi-layered with texture to chew on."
4,Growing up in the shadow of a black hole,"Laurie Fox subtitles My Sister from the Black Lagoon, ""A Novel of My Life."" This leaves us to guess whether the book's covers are wrapped around a fictionalized autobiography, or autobiographical fiction. In either case, Ms. Fox tells the hard story of Lorna's growing up in the presence of a dominant, abusive, bullying, passive-aggressive, light-sucking-needy, tortured psychotic younger sister, Lonnie. Could you imagine Lorna growing into adulthood without Lonnie's acidic fingerprints etched indelibly into her personality? But there is another story here too. That is the story of the sister of the sister from the black lagoon: the story of Lorna, who grows beyond the scars inflicted by her bizarre sister to discover herself as a creative force in the world."
3,Not Up to its Blurbs,"Laurie Fox's autobiographical novel is good, especially compared to what passes as novels these days, but it is not as good as its blurbers, Carolyn See and Wally Lamb, suggest. The character of Lonnie, the mentally ill sister, is poorly drawn and largely absent from the story. We get the idea that Lorna's problems arise from her family's neglect of her, but that connection isn't really drawn. The writing can also be trite--too many exclamation points. However, there are also wonderful vignettes--especially the scenes in which Lorna and Lonnie play together when young and those in which Lorna is able to indulge her love for drama."
4,Fox is a gifted writer,"I found _My Sister..._ a thoughful and careful book written with an honesty that reminds me of Alice Munro. The novel was not perfect, as it lagged towards the end, but I guess that's the pitfall of writing of one's life. I first heard of this book while Fox was being interviewed on a local radio show in the Bay Area, and she seemed so sincere and her story so compelling that I went out and bought the book. Can't wait until the sequel."
5,"Well-writen, poetic, hauntingly honest with humor","Laurie Fox is truly a poet. Her autobiographical tale ellicits the difficult truths that survivors from a home with a mentally ill member hold private and constant. Lorna's troubled childhood with her mentally ill sister is fraught with the anxieties and laughter that all girls can relate to, but her struggle to succeed as an independent woman and learn to live with the guilt of surviving in a dysfunctional family are what makes the telling of the novel so relentlessly gripping. Laurie Fox bares her soul, her sorrow, and her story in an accessible, emotional, and sympathetic style. This is her first novel, but I can't wait to read more."
2,worth what i paid...,"...and i got the book for free. I thought the book sounded interesting, like it would be more about the relationship between the 2 sisters, or maybe an interesting character study into the mind. Instead what i got was a totally dysfunctional family with an overbearing father and a doormat mother who are too wrapped up in themselves to really deal with a special needs kid (the only person in this story that really gets pushed aside and you feel truely bad for). Lorna's tale is more about herself and learning her place in this world, which i'm not sure she ever does. The writing is self centered and paints the writer as completely neurotic and probably in need of professional help as much as her sister (who is absent from about half of the book). An OK read but pretty disappointing overall considering it could have been a whole lot more."
2,Blade dulls quickly,"I have found that the blade on this peeler dulls very quickly making it near impossible to use. However, I must add that my mother in law loves it, and when the blade dulls she just throws it out and buys another one for $5.00. But I prefer my new peeler which I've had for one year now and is as sharp as ever."
3,More of a novel than a guide,"This is written in the style of Lets Go and Lonely Planet covering two countries in the same size book that the others have for one. It doesn't have as many sub headings as it's competitors and each city reads like a chapter in a novel with limited subheadings. This can make quick searches for things take a bit longer. This book is more for the person who uses the book to read up and obtain information to plan their trip before travelling. For those who buy these sorts of guides just to find hostels, bus companies etc while travelling then Let's Go would be a better purchase. In fact Let's Go is better for the former person as well. This book is better than Lonely Planet Australia though but then hey anything is. Let's Go both Australia and New Zealand editions and Lonely Planet New Zealand are far better than this book and have heaps more hostel listings and information."
3,punched,"I first saw this in the movies when it first came out as ""bogard"" and it was rated x,the box had a unrated title but after viewing it it was the same r rated version that has been out for years.as i recall there was about 10 -15 minutes from the original movie cut out to give it a r rating so it played as all the other versions out there with different names.if you can find the original version it may say x but it should have been rated mature as there was no real sex in the film.They should remaster it as the color looks like a vhs or ""beta "" tape."
5,great rifle book,If you have an interest in Japanese rifles you need this book. It will help you know what you have and what is correct and what is not.
4,like them less the rubber rings,"I am 5'9"" and they work great. They are sturdy even though many people have said that they aren't. The only problem is the rubber rings they have for grip. The rings slip sideways out of the groves. I have pushed them to the side for now and am thinking about maybe doing a bit of super glue to hold them in place. They look nice and I have a VTX 1300."
5,A classic,"This is the classic Zelda game, the one that enshrined the franchise in video game history. This game is still fun after almost 20 years - and it's now available on Wii. Great music, beautiful worlds, fun and challenging levels. Unique amongst video games at the time (or even today), it has a rich plot, including a dramatic opening level. The switch between the Light and Dark worlds works great. At some points the game gets ridiculously difficult, but usually it is pretty manageable. Just make sure to buy enough potions to increase your health!As for the guide, it's more of a hint book that a genuine walkthrough. It doesn't do a good job explaining how to get around some of the obstacles. That being said, it's a beautiful book, with lots of great exclusive illustrations. It also is written more like a lore book than a modern video game guide. I recommend it for Zelda fans, but more as a collectible than a real guide."
5,Talking about getting my hair dry...,This hair dryer is so powerful that it blows the water straight out of my hair into the wall next to me hahahaha...bought it for my wife but i love using it too :p
5,Best dryer ever,This dryer has dried my hair in half the time as any other that I have tried. My stylist uses this same model and I got it on Amazon for half the price!
5,worth the money,"Dries very fast and leaves hair smooth and shiny. A little heavy. If that will bother you, consider the travel size."
5,Get a salon blow out at home with this!!!!,"I've never spent more than $40 on a hair dryer and it was a big leap to decide on this one. But it was reviewed a year ago in WIRED magazine...considering that magazine usually reviews smartphones and other high tech items, I thought I should pay attention when they decide to review a hair dryer. I am so glad that I invested the money...because of its power, I don't have to have the heat on high to dry my hair quickly. And with a little practice handling it (it's a little heavier than cheaper dryers), I'd say my blow outs are close to salon quality. The only con is that it is on the heavy side but considering its design and the results I get, I don't care about the weight. Is it quiet? I never understood that question in relation to hair dryers. You only get quiet dryers when they have no power. So I'd say no, this one isn't quiet but I don't look for that in a dryer."
2,Crima and Passion an awkward mix,"Deadly Affairs is the second book in a new imprint by Virgin called Crime and Passion. Virgin is famous for the famous Black Lace series of erotica. The point of the new imprint is to mix erotica with crime fiction. Too bad it doesn't work. The ""sexy bits"" seem like they were just added to fulfill guidelines (erotica must have 50% sex scenes). The story itself is okay, not a very complicated mystery at all. A womanizing executive is killed and the hero, John Anderson finds out that there are many people with a reason to kill. The sex scenes are well written, but they add nothing to the book except to make it a bit naughty. I won't even go into the cold, controling ""hero"" or the slutty female executive or the sexually repressed diviorcee. Too cliched to bother with. Hopefully as the imprint grows, the books will get better. I think mysteries can be very sexy. I'll keep reading the Crime and Passion series in hopes of a better read."
3,Blade is off at high speed.,"I purchased this blade for winter storm, and just used several times.It worked okay at surface street within 35 mi/hr but at highway speed (60+ mi/hr) part of blade does not touch the windshield."
2,Quite disappointed in the blade that length,"I heard great reviews for these as I did a lot of research. My 2 star rating only goes for the driver-side blade (24"")fitting my car, a dodge intrepid ES 2001. I bought those 3 months ago and it is streaking like mad. I am going to have to replace it as I can't hardly see through the streaks when it's raining. Could be a defective blade too, I don't know. The 22"" blade on the passenger side seems to be holding up much better with hardly any streaking."
3,"They work, but not well","I bought a grand total of 4 blades for 2 cars. All the blades worked fine at first but seem to be wearing out rather quickly. Not more than a month in there was some serious streaking on both cars.2/4 blades, its its still better than the pair they replaced but its also a much shorter lifespan than I expected."
4,Good Perspective Adjustment,"The title of this book spoke volumes to me before I even cracked the cover. Reading about her perspective that women want to be wanted rather than fully know was right on target for me and because of the new found perspective, I felt released from the need of ""wanting to be wanted."" I resist some of her claims as to WHY women do this - from my point of view, she spends a little too much time blaming society, culture, men. I think the WHY is important to know, but I wanted to see the book focus a bit more on what women can DO about it. In general, the book more than serves its purpose to raise the issue and bring awareness to it. Overall, excellent, thought-provoking book."
1,"Duro-Med Hinged Elevated Toilet Seat Elongated, White","Very disappointed in the Duro-Med Elevated Toilet Seat Elongated. Poor Design, NOT Sanitary it allows urine to accumulate under the seat. Would not recommend! Do not buy!"
2,Works but will tarnish and corrode.,"This adapter will work for adapting a BNC antenna to a UHF style connector. The center conductor will transmit audio and the signal will get through. But over time, these cheaper connectors will tarnish and audio quality will drop off. Good for use on a hand held radio, but not for leaving out in the elements for a long period of time.Get the better Tessco version with a better finish for outdoor use."
3,Cobra HA-BNC CB Adapter,"We ordered the wrong part, don't know if it works. It was delivered as promised."
4,Fits perfectly,This item was purchased to be used as an adapter for my midland handheld cb radio to be connected to a midland external car type antenna. It fits perfectly together. The only problem I had were both the midland cb handheld radio and the antenna were piece of junk. This was the only item that was good! I should had bought cobra cb radio and antenna instead..too bad.
4,A Decent Textbook,"I was required to get this books for class, and it's really not that bad. As textbooks go, it's fabulous, actually. The stories are intersting and the information is helpful. A good buy, and a lot cheaper on Amazon then it would be at my university book store. That's the part I like the best."
3,School requirment,"I bought this book because it was a school requirement for one of my general Ed classes. The book was okay, but I didn't keep it in my library after the class was over, so that's got to say something."
4,It's a good read....,"I purchased this for class, but the stories it contains are really great. I fully intend on keeping this book for years, many really wonderful stories and good background on the authors."
5,Great item! Fast shipping!,I needed this book for my Short Story class. I received it in a timely manner and in decent condition. I am very pleased with my purchase.
3,it was ok,the book wasnt in that great of a condition as they claimed it to be.. but it was a decent price.
2,Un-plesant to watch,"Let me say it at once: This is NOT a sensational opera DVD. It is NOT one of the very best - far from it. To wit: Patrizia Ciofi gives one the constant impression that she is wrestling (with her facial expression) in order to produce all of her singing notes, by the time it gets to the higher notes her face is so distorted, as if she is about to suffer a brain-struck. Her head is continuously tilted sideways and her face becomes asymmetrically - this is frightening to watch. A good singer she is indeed - but what's the gain here at the age of DVD and Blu-ray...? Awfully wrong.Ad to it the stupid staging that serves no purpose and you end with a DVD that you can do without. If you must have this opera take the other one, with Dassi."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,I bought this book as a gift for my Grandpa and Dad they loved it - both say it knocked a few strokes off their game!
3,Mixed Bag,"This collection was put together shortly after the Year One reboot. The good stories ignore it, paying at most a one-line token reference to Selina having a dubious past (now mercifully retconned - AMEN!). Still, the best stories are not able to present the smart, classy, sophisticated character true Cat-fans (not to mention Bat-fans) expect."
1,Fan fiction at its worst,"If you want to read the worst stories about Catwoman, you've found the perfect book written by a bunch of Miller-lites.Forget playful thief. Think crazy sexual deviant. Think misogyny.A book only unsubs would enjoy."
4,Delivered really quickly.,"This product came really quickly, though the cost for delivery was a wee bit exhorbitant. I enjoyed watching it. It's a very cute story at first, with misunderstandings all around, and then you get to see the seriousness of the back story and what happened to the boys before they were separated. A very nice, all around complete story."
5,A twisted fate,"The first I watched this series, I was blowned away by the direction it took at the end. Very surprising. Totally unexpected. The boys are cute and the adults have dark mysterious secrets, a great recipe for an unusual series. The boy love is hilarious and touching. I loved it!"
1,not the right fit,"although it is featured as an exact match for a Ford Escape 2003, it does not fit.I cut and modified it in order to make it fit, it is working for now. so if you are intending to buy this for a Ford Escape Do NOT buy it.Overall quality is acceptable."
2,Does Not Fit,"The interactive option on the page specifically said this product would work for my 2005 Escape, but even with the various ""adapters,"" the hole where it would fit onto the wiper arm was not big enough. Shipping was over half the price of the blade so it wasn't even worth it to return."
1,"Anco Wiper blade 10""","I received my wiper blade, but it did not fit my car. The arm was too wide for the base.I had looked up this blade on Anco's website and Amazon and did lots of research to make sure I got the right product. This blade was recommended for a 2007 Ford Escape XLT. I am going to have to return it.I am probably going to have to find a replacement from the Ford Dealership."
2,Did not fit !,"I made sure this was listed for my vehicle, and it was: ""This product fits your 2005 Dodge Magnum Fitment Notes: Wiper Blade, REAR - SPECIALTY"" Anco 31 Series 3110 Wiper Blade - 10""It did not. I had to remove the rubber insert from the frame, cutting off the retaining tabs, and install it by ""rigging"" it in my old frame. Very disappointed."
3,Fit for Ford Escape,"This wiper fit my 2005 Ford Escape but not very securely. The spring pressure keeps the blade in, but it would be better if it clicked in and locked."
3,The blade didn't fit.,"I ordered this 10 inch ANCO wiper blade for my wife's 2007 Ford Escape rear window and the blade didn't fit onto the wiper arm because the track in ANCO fitting was not wide enough for the wiper arm. I use ANCO blades all the time because there cheap and do a good job and I change them every year and I never had a problem with them fitting. I'm sure the blade would of worked fine if it would of just fit. I have no problem with the shipper because the blade just didn't fit but I would caution anybody with a 2007 ford escape from buying this blade for the rear window, Ford Co is probably the only place you can get these blades so they can charge you a arm and a leg to get one."
1,Find something better.,"I'm not taking the wiper assembly on our 2005 Escape apart for this. It should either fit quickly and easily, or not be recommended for this kind of wiper arm at all. Takes less than 30 seconds to do both front wipers with a different brand, but no B&M stores in the area sell size 10 blades so I had to order these. Anco's Kwik Connect system may work just fine for some brands, but not all the time and they should be aware of such issues and address them."
1,not for Ford Escape,"although Anco says this 31-10 replaces the Ford Escape rear wiper, it won't fit. It comes with several adapters, but the slot in the blade cartridge won't fit over the end of the arm. I couldn't use the rubber blade part either because the Anco part is wider than the slot in the Ford arm. I took it off to bring it with me as I search for refills (just the rubber part)"
1,Stick with the real deal,"I have a 2002 Ford Escape.This wiper is cheaply made and does not fit. Not even with the adapters.The wiper blade is not wide enough to fit on the arm.I could not even use the rubber blade as a refill since it is not made to be easily removable.I use Anco blades as well as others on my cars, and replace them all the time This one is not rightand wss a complete waste of time and money.I will go and buy something made for my car from the dealer who will stand behind it."
1,Didn't fit my vehicle,"I purchased one of these for use on the rear of my 2005 Ford Escape after using Amazon's application to verify that it would fit. I was unable to install it though, because the wiper blade was too narrow to fit on the arm of my vehicle."
5,Fits 1979 MGB,"Bought this on Amazon and irt fits perfectly on my 1979 MGB. I'll review the performance/quality later after 2 months.I'll be comparingAnco 31 Series 3110 Wiper Blade - 10""withTrico Products 10-1 Exact Fit Wiper Blade - 10""andBosch 40710 Micro Edge Wiper Blade - 10"""
1,Doesn't work properly,"I put this on as soon as it arrived, and I am very dissatisfied with it. It doesn't even work properly, it's as if its bent or something, only wipes certain spots."
4,"2005 Ford Escape - Perfect Fit, Good Quality For Price","I was able to install this wiper without removing the wiper arm with some creative twisting an threading. It works perfectly. Not the best wiper money can buy, but a great value all things considered."
1,Not Recommended,"This item is just a plastic toy. Gears and everything, inside and out, are made of plastic, and the slackness of gearing, inaccurate resetting, etc., make accuracy a hit or miss accomplishment with this beauty. Also, the weird shape does not make it comfortable or convenient to read or move along a map. It would definitely be a good idea to avoid this product. Although the concept of such a product is, I think, a good one, this product is definitely not the answer."
5,Wonderful Recording,Jan really knows how to play emotional without beeing to technical. This is one of the best Piano players of our time.A very personal approach.Definitely a record to get !!
4,DAM!.....AWSOME!...........!!!!!!!!!!!!,When i watched the movie it made me have to buy the soundtrack![it was so awesome]My friend just had to buy it too!!!!I would give it ..1...2..3.4....5.6........10 stars by my standards!
2,Risk Analysis,To whom it may concern:I order two books from Amazon and I have yet to receive my books. My class have already started and I don't know what to do at this point.V/rDavid
2,Dissappointed,"I agree with B. Durbin's review. At times I was wondering if he was looking at the same text that I was. I got to chapter 12 and decided to read some reviews before I went further. He tends to be verbose in hopes you will accept his interpetation. I will probably finish it (only 70 pages left. If he was more to the point, say, 150 pages instead of 250, it would have been a better read."
3,Damged Property,The book was not properly packaged and was severely damaged by the post office. It could not be used in the library and had to be replaced by another copy. Too bad! Our Loss! No compensation!
4,"Engrossing, informative and genuinely interesting.","No perfomer can truly be classified as a comedic talent unless that person is willing to do anything to get a laugh. The word ""anything"" can be daunting because there is such a fine line between appearing funny, and being publicly humiliated. Lucille Ball was willing to take every comedic risk thrown her way, from pies in the face to stomping on grapes the size of eyeballs. Her book acknowledges that the negative aspects of her personal life often renewed her incentive to strive to gain fame and fortune no matter how many obstacles she encountered. Comedy and tragedy were intertwined throughout her life, making Lucille Ball one of the most fascinating icons of her generation."
5,I Love Lucy Even More!!!!!!!!,"Love, Lucy, by Lucille Ball is an Autobiography of Lucy that was found after her death. The book begings when she was a child, to her days as a movie actress in Hollywood, then to I Love Lucy fame, then how she started her second series The Lucy Show. It is just facinating to read about Lucy's life from Lucy herself. It is facinating to read about all she went through in her life, both her triumphs, and tribulations. I loved the part when she talked about creating I Love Lucy, and how it came about. She was a really great woman, and now after reading this memoir, i love lucy even more!"
5,Enjoyable Reading!,A delightful book to read about Lucille Ball. Reading the book is as if she is sitting in the room telling you her story about her life. She lets you in on the personal feelings about her life
4,"Lucille Ball's candid, occasionally moving autobiography","I enjoyed this book very much. I don't know all that much about Lucille Ball, but I did learn a lot of stuff here that I'm sure I wouldn't have heard anywhere else. She's very candid in describing her childhood in New York, career in modeling and then movies, her expereinces on the ""I Love Lucy"" show, and her tumultuous marriage to Desi Arnaz. It's quite clear they were both madly in love with each other but just weren't suited to each other. I had a feeling she was holding back when describing his faults, as she didn't include many vivid details, but it seems she really didn't want to hurt him. She seems to have finally become happy again in her second marriage to comedian Gary Morton, and I was glad. This book actually moved me occaionally. I'd like to read Desi Arnaz's autobiography, A Book, to see his view of the story. Is it available in msot bookstores?"
3,Remenicing,"Good story written by Lucy herself, published because her children forund the manuscript after she had passed.. For the OLDIES. Bought it because I was a Lucy fan."
4,Ball separates the facts from the fiction!,"This book was written in Lucy's own words, and finally, after all the gossip about her life with Desi, we can find out how the story REALLY went! Told with incredible dignity, the story begins with Lucy's early life in Jamestown, and ends in the early sixties after her second marriage. Lucy speaks candidly about her love for Desi and their incompatability; it is obvious in the bitter-sweet ending that they loved each other until their dying days. A wonderful read!"
4,:),"The book came in good shape for being used. Took a little long to get here, but not too long. It just came today, I read a little so far and cant wait to finish this book!"
2,Not as good as other bios,"Of the 4 Lucy bios I have read, this one is by far the least enlightening. She completely glosses over her emotional problems with Desi's infidelity, ascribing the divorce to irreconcilable differences. Huh?"
4,Nice book,"I agree with the first review for this book, ""A GOOD SHORT READ"". It is better than ""The Princess Test"" because Rosella doesn't get so lucky with her prince like Laurelei (the heroine of ""Princess Test""). I don't think Rosella lets people walk all over her. She's just nice, and has a kind heart. And she DOES stand up for herself in the end. If you like funny, twisted fairy tales, when the bad guys REALLY get what they deserve, read this book."
5,The Fairy's Mistake,"Rosella is a girl that has a twin sister named Myrtle who makes Rosella do all the work. One day while Rosella is getting some water, a fairy spots her and decides to tranform herself into an old woman. When Rosella saw her, she gave the woman some water to drink. When the fairy discovers the kindness of Rosella she decides to cast a spell on her. The spell makes jewels come out of Rosella's mouth when she talks. This spell soon creates a few conflits. I thought this was a great book because there are lots of funny parts and I was really surprised at the end."
5,A fun fairy tale,"This is a witty, short fairy tale by a great author. However, if you're looking for a full-length fairy tale, read Ella Enchanted or The Two Princesses of Bamarre. The Princess Tales are charming, short, easy reads."
3,Not a bad way to spend an afternoon...,"Rosella, in the village of Snettering-on-Snoakes, was fetching water one day ... and inadvertently gave the fairy Ethelinda a drink of water (as Ethelinda stood disguised as an old lady). As a reward for her good deed, Rosella received the gift of whenever she spoke, jewels fell out of her mouth. After her own run-in with Ethelinda, Rosella's mean twin Myrtle was cursed w/ having creepy crawlies come out of her mouth as she talked.In the pages that follow, everyone, including Ethelinda, learns a valuable lesson.An entertaining twist on an old fairy tale once again by Ms. Carson Levine"
4,between 4 and 5 stars,"This was a great story, but it was a little to easy. I finished it in like no time at all. But as far as what the book was about, I'd give it 5 stars!"
5,A very good 'how to' book.,"I wish all 'how to' books were as good as ""Polaroid Transfers"".Kathleen Thormod Carr knows her stuff. I would venture to say that anyone who reads the book cover to cover, assembles the necessary equipment (not a lot), and spends a rainy day indoors on this project will get good results before the day is through.Just know that although her techniques are obvious and easy to follow, your own polaroid images will have a life of their own.I suspect that 'Carr's First Law' should be that ""the worst pictures will transfer easiest"". Good luck with your best images.Buy the book. Read it twice. Make some excellent transfers. Impress your friends. :-)"
4,Good Story,"I receive a Tesla S within a month so I thought I would read this story of the first popular electric car. This is a good, interesting story however it seems to try to hard to search for the conspiracy that killed it. After watching this I still couldn't tell you who killed the electric car although I do think the remaining models should have been sold to those leasing the cars.But what was most interesting to me was the company that had an excellent model for battery development. Eventually his company ends up sold to an oil company. Now, does that seem normal?This is not a groundbreaking documentary and won't be long remembered. But it is an interesting subject as electric cars finally are available for the public."
1,Still waiting,"I am still waiting for my dvd, it was supposed to arrive seven days ago.What happened? I know I chose the regular service but I have waited too long. I am very disappointed. I am beginning to think I have lost my money."
2,Good Historical Perspective,A very good coverage of the history of the car companies activities against the electric car and of recent electric car developments.
3,theres still a chance to make electric cars,is it going to help get electric cars back on the road again by making a film called who killed the electric car might get them back well maybe in the future but now wor this documentary shows us how much the people cared about them and how this could save the enviroment by not using these big trucks that spread gas.
2,Give me a break,"This is another of those conspiracy-type movies out there, I can't believe that everyone believes what they see.GM made a great car and several thousand people agreed to buy one. When it came out, only a handful of people actually backed it up and leased one. They proved that they had the ability to make an electric car, but it was waaaay too expensive for them to ever support such a low-production vehicle.If they actually allowed people to buy out these cars, no matter what the contract, someone would have found a way to sue GM into giving them maintenance and support. Considering how they lost all the $$ in the first place, they would not be able to support a car with new batteries and other parts."
3,"Decent film, slanted perspective.",Well researched and presented film. Blatently leaves out the fact that auto-makers by law have to service their vehicles for 10 years if they leave them on the road. Demonizes the industry for destroying the electric model car. Otherwise the film does a decent job of portraying the green side of the energy argument.
4,Electric Car Delibrately Killed,"The film explores the reasonably successful electric car developed by General Motors to meet California regulatory goals in the early 2000s. The goals were watered down, the car development was cut, and then all cars in the public sector for customer evaluation were demolished. The film details the oil companies; federal and local government; and car manufacturers involved and the individuals controlling those decisions. Their possible motives are explored. As an American, it's humiliating and frustrating; as a Japanese car manufacturer, i.e. Honda or Toyota, who have popular hybrid models selling well in our markets, I'm sure it's quite amusing."
5,The Promise of a Better Tomorrow... crushed by big oil and the auto makers,"This is a great documentary that shows what progress and innovation can bring when big companies work for a better tomorrow, and how they will stop at nothing to destroy that progress when it threatens their money and power.Living outside of California, I had no idea that these cars were used on such a large scale.What a great impact these cars could have had on reducing our need for foreign oil and reduced smog pollution, if only the auto makers and big oil hadn't successfully killed it all. Keep betting on people buying gas-guzzling SUVs, see how well that works as gas passes $4 a gallon.GM is probably regretting not expanding the EV program, but big oil is still laughing all the way to the bank."
5,everyone needs to see this and wake up,"That we could have had the electric car years ago and were denied the opportunity is so infuriating...You will find yourself shaking your head as the sad story unfolds. If you get angry, that's exactly the right response."
5,A great movie about something most us never knew existed,"This is a great movie and for those of us not in California, something that is a total suprise these cars existed. What a waste of a wonderful chance, especially by GM.Besides some startup companies who are in the process of making electric cars now (Tesla for example), Nissan recently stated a commitment to electric vehicles and selling them in the US (2010 ~ 2012 or so). Maybe we'll get this choice of vehicle power after all. After watching this, I'd really like to have an EV1 instead though..."
3,Sloppy documentary,"This movie only pretends to take the viability of the electric car seriously. Some interesting questions are raised, but none are adequately explored or answered. The specters of conspiracy, collusion, greed, and incompetence are raised, but they never materialize. The saving grace is at the end of the movie, when we are introduced to Toyota's newest development of an electric rechargeable hybrid vehicle. Sounds pretty good to me, and that should quash any charges of evil conspiracies.I have to say it was amusing to see Mel Gibson featured. In light of his recent arrest for drunk driving, I had to wonder if he was driving an electric car! And in light of the vitriol he spewed at the arresting officers, I wonder if he made any anti-smogic remarks about the police cruiser!"
4,NIL,"THE DVD ON ""WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR"" SHOWED UP THE MANY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS WHICH KILLED OFF SUCH A GOOD INNOVATION. IT'S A SHAME TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STOOPING DOWN SO LOW TO THE PRESSURES FROM THE BIG-BOYS BUSINESSES!I WOULD THINK THAT SUCH AN ELECTRIC PRODUCTION CAR WILL SURVIVE MUCH BETTER IN WESTERN EUROPE, AND EAST ASIA (ESP JAPAN) WHO ARE MORE KEEN TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE INVENTORS AND ENGINEERS OF THIS PROJECT SHOULD HEAD TO THOSE SHORES AND TRY AGAIN."
5,Eye Opening,"I bought this DVD after reading about it in a newspaper article. It was in one of those top 10 gifts for people hard to buy for articles. I bought it for my Dad for Christmas and he LOVED it. It is very interesting and thought provoking. I was shocked to learn about the reasons for why this very successful EV1 car was taken back from owners and crushed.My Dad told me I could borrow the DVD, but to make sure I returned it because he wanted to share it with others as well!!!"
4,The Truth,"This movie is a great lesson in how corporations and politicians cater to the few rather than helping the average person. We had the electric car and now it's ""gone"" . The filmmakers make excellent points and really examine the different facets of the issue."
5,I want an electric car!,The documentary is about an electric car GM launched and then pulled over the objections of the people who had leased them. The documentary investigates the reasons why the vehicle was pulled out of the market considering the efforts by the owners and other companies to keep it in them. This is an extremely interesting and well made movie. It is definitely an eye-opener and everyone should see it. The movie is well made. It is also very intriguing and relevant to what is going on today: gas prices and fuel alternatives.
5,Mesmerizing!,"Mesmerizing!I always wondered what did happen to the electric car. In fact in the past few moths I talked to a friend about them. Now this very important film answers the question of the electric car. I must warn you this film is like a book one cannot put down, it is simply mesmerizing. Then comes the under current of emotion, ANGER! I am so glad this film was made, please do our country, our world, our planet, a big favor - buy this DVD!"
4,"Good movie - not terribly ""sided"".","I bought this movie half expecting it to be ""Michael Moore - like"". Actually, it's not too bad. Michael Moore would find it a bit too factual for his tastes. It does raise good questions, and stays with the facts allowing you to draw your own conclusion. It does however tempt you to a conclusion of theirs. In all, you have to stand back and wonder how certain private individuals today have succesfully made an electric car practical, with a range of nearly 300 miles on a charge - and still the auto industry has you believing the best they can do is a semi-electric (hybrid), that just so happens to still use gas. Hummm??? Grab the movie. If you're a conspiracy type person, you'll eat it up. If you're open-minded, it's a good factual recollection of the EV-1. All others, you'll probably take it or leave it."
5,Forgotten by the News Media???,"It's amazing, there were good working American-made electric cars over a decade ago. I remember when they came out, I was giving them a few years before I got one--when suddenly, they were pulled out of the market.This documentary tells why. Owners of these cars were happy with them, they looked good (blended well with other cars, can't even tell them apart).These days though, when the news media talks about electric cars as cars of the future that may not work--I always wonder--haven't they done their homework? We already had electric cars and they were great!"
5,Electric car fan,I have seen this movie three times and will see it again. Each time I feel sorry for GM and America. This car seems to be a great answer to high fuel prices. Ithink everyone needs to see this film. We have to make some changes soon. I will not purchase a new car until it is a lot like EV 1. A British company is developing a Mini Cooper Electric Car.
2,"Physics, chemistry and economics","The electric car isn't ready for prime time because it can't do what's required. Until people are willing to drive small, light cars short distances the electric car won't be viable. The time isn't yet right for cars that pollute elsewhere."
3,who killed the electric car and why,the goverment sucks were in the middle of a war and it seems to me that this has to do with oil you cant invent something powerful that can save these
1,More liberal lies!,The technology does not work and now they blame it on the cooperations!The movie itself is dull and boring!
5,Excellent Movie,"I thought it was a great movie, to bad for the ending but i would more then likely want to see the EV1 back on the road if not a replacement..also would like to thank the teams of people who created the EV1.-Nate"
5,Hay que verla,"Otra pelicula, como un must see. Hay que verla. Es otra pelicula que le muestra a una como funcionan las cosas en el mundo corporativo, o mas bien en el mundo real."
5,CHANGE THE WORLD............ SEE THIS MOVIE,"THis movie is a must see... see how GM f**ked over the electric car movement and how the electric car has been killed by big oil, the us government and GM.Rent this and do your grandkids a favor.It's not only eye opening and informational, it's very entertaining too."
4,Electric Car Documentary,This was a very educational documentary that consistently maintained my attention. In my experience almost all documentaries are biased towards obvious points of view; still this film was nevertheless quite convincing regarding the issues it sought to raise.
4,Review of Who Killed the Electric Car video,"Interesting, informative. Could have dealt a bit more with the reluctance of persons to buy electric cars until they can drive much longer distances without a recharge. Even though most drivers go less than 100 miles a day, those who can afford only one car would want one for long distance trips when on vacation. I have no doubt, thought, this could be developed.There could also have been some discussion of the pollution that comes from generating electricity.Good balance between speakers and action scenes. Entertaining and informative.Charles Lamb"
5,I could not stand still watching this movie,After watching this movie my wife and I made a pledge to never buy a GM car ever!This movie will make you want to act now. For the nation and for the future!
3,Amazing Solar System DVD,Hello - I would like to review the product - which arrived in good time etc. but unfortunately it was a DVD and not the Planetary Science model making kit - it seems to have the same name exactly. Would be good to know if the model kit is available. Best wishes. Twig Hall
4,A memoir that inspired me 40 years ago!,"In my youth, I often vacationed in Maine and happened to find this book in the local library during one trip. It was truly inspiring for me as a young girl, both to appreciate the great state of Maine and to go on to write memoirs of my own. I would recommend this classic to any would-be memoirist, as a great example of how a well-written life story can transcend time."
3,it's ok but his logoc is sometimes faulty,he drones on and on and on. It would have been better to read a synopsis . This will definately cure your insomnia
4,Nice item to have if you have more vehicles to drive than drivers.,"I have 2 Cobra 75WX CB's and 4 vehicles, of which 2 are driven often, and 2 not so often (Jeeps for off-road). With these extra remote mounts I can use the 2 CB's I have in multiple vehicles. A Very good desing if you ask me. Once installed. Just have to unscrew the handset and move to the next vehicle. Extremely easy!. Only thing I can think that is missing is a mic holder should be included with the remote mount box. I think anyone could assume that if your buying a remote mounting box that your going to install it into another vehicle. That you would also need a handset mount for the CB. I had to go to a CB store and buy a handset mount seperately (2)."
4,CB Radio,"Installation was a little tricky - had to find and accessable hidden spot with power. Radio is completely concelled, and working just fine."
4,Not much to review,"This box is required for the radio that uses it. So, it's pointless to review it without the radio. I like mine, but the volume could be MUCH louder. Don't know if that's the box or the radio."
2,Fruitful Journeys: Unfrutiful Reading,"This is a tough read. It is written in dense anthropological style, heavy with symbolism and steeped in nearly unintelligible post-modernism. The author writes like a ""good-ole boy"", though a woman. The good thing about the book is there are lots of Hindu, Rajasthani and Sanskrit tales and songs translated into English, and they seem to be true to the original meanings of Indian society. This is a good read, if you can ignore that it sounds like a man wrote it at the begining of the twentieth century."
2,Pet Peeve,"I just hate it when the tracks on the album aren't listed. I don't know if it's the seller's fault or if Amazon doesn't give the seller room to list them, but I could never buy any album if the tracks aren't listed. Other items I would like to see regularly on any record for sale is, which record label issued it, what was the date of issue of the one for sale (along with the original issue date, if applicable and known) and the catalog number of the record being sold."
4,Good if you don't expect too much.,"Don't expect this to be a perfect camera. The photos tend to be dark (no flash), and the quality is not great. That said, I have a camera in my pocket to take snapshots of events that I wouldn't bother bringing a bigger camera to. For me, it's worth a few dollars to have a camera with me, even if I use a different camera for planned shooting.Even at top quality, it takes enough photos. The software is easy to use and the digital scrapbook is cute and easy to use, though not designed for printing. The webcam feature works very well, especially with Skype. Just install the camera, plug it in, start Skype, and away you go. The film option works, but only for a few seconds. For my needs, the camera is worth the price.MAKE SURE:1. Load the software before you plug the camera into your computer.2. This camera only works with a PC.3. It uses a AAA battery and has a reasonable life span. But if your battery goes dead, you lose your photos."
2,Dont waste time(not money),"Although the price is nice, its like its useless. You can't really have a decent picture, I tried all settings, hi Res, low Res, any configuration posible, with no success, and sometimes it makes like a short-circuit and the batteries are wasted.The problem is that all this tipe of mini cameras use a CMOS sensor wich captures bad quality images, while others use CCD sensor, which is much better.Really dont buy it. I didnt want a camera mora than 1MP, but with this you dont get a image."
5,Simply the Best,"Since purchasing this game, I have discovered a vast online community that offers updates, mods, tracks, and carsets. Almost any form of auto racing is available to use with this software with complete support from people who are passionate about racing."
4,NASCAR HEAT,"A good game to srart with if you have a good disposition. Very competitive. You never spin out and it is very hard to spin the computer car. You can hit the corners at full speed and not worry about hitting the wall or spinning out. The car you drive, your choice, slows down for you at the corners. What makes this game fun is the competition. No matter the track, computer cars are all around you. Make a mistake and you place last. Computer car # 18, Bobby Lamont(sp) is your best competion. You or him will usually get post 1 or 2. Even if you win, he will be a millisecond behind you. Sometimes it is fustrating, and it happens a lot in the long races, to have 5 or 6 cars and you past the finish line together and you are 5th or 6th. You will have to hug the inside of the curve or these guys will slip past you.Donald Lindsey"
5,fun book,"The book arrived yesterday, and I am having fun asking my husband when he is going to make a ""spud Gun"". He has been reading it very quickly, and always with a grin on his face. Highly reccommended"
5,Backyard Ballistics,I found this book very interesting and so did my son. He plans on doing some of the projects in the book for 4H.
3,"Fun, but needs more work","This book is a lot of fun. The projects are things that you can do safely, and that kids really like. I just wish the author had put a little more work into it. Some of the history doesn't seem accurate, and the physics should be explained more clearly. More effort on content and less on strange facts would help.Building the onager (torsion catapult), I had to change most of the dimensions. The book calls for 1""x1"" wood, but that's hard to find. 1x2 (nominal) is easy to find, but is 3/4"" by 1 1/2"". A book for quick projects should use 1x2s, not some mythical 1"" square lumber. The drawings were incomplete. Between the drawings and the photo it was possible to get the whole thing together, but I had to change most of the dimensions. Why he uses 1/8"" dowel is beyond me. Even 3/16"" broke too easily.Overall, interesting and certainly fun, but I wish it were done more carefully."
3,Bang,Informative but not quite the content I had been expecting. A little more detail in construction would have been appreciated
3,Cool but not alot of stuff,This book is good if you want to launch stuff throught the air. I just wanted more things to make.
3,Fun stuff,"We built the potato cannon this week and it was ridiculously fun to use. Nobody lost an eye or a finger, although we splattered potato all over our neighbors car that was close to the tree we were aiming at. The rest of the projects seemed a little derivative and we don't have plans to build anything else."
2,Very Disappointing,"We all were so excited when my son received this book for his birthday. We spent a nice afternoon with two teenagers making two different projects. The instructions didn't make sense, requiring you to make up parts or guess at what the author wants. And then, neither worked as advertised. One (tennis ball mortar) didn't work at all and the other (pneumatic rocket)required modification to get even the disappointing results we achieved. I would not recommend this book at all unless you already know how to do these projects. (But then why would you buy the book?)"
5,IT'S A BLAST,"Even if you don't constuct any of the 13 items described in this book, it's well worth a read for the history alone. Gurstelle has done an excellent job of explaning the science, technology and history behind each device. There is a very strong emphasis on safety and following proper procedures and the detailed diagrams make construction easier. Follow-up questions lead young scientists into further discoveries. A bang-up job."
5,Backyard Ballistics Review,"My son and I built the potato cannon. We modified the plans to use 4 inch PVC instead of 3 inch. With the lantern sparker (from Walmart) and using Right Guard deodorant, you can launch a potato several hundred feet. Great book, fun reading."
5,Interesting and innovative,"""Backyard Ballistics"" is a great contribution to the library of anybody who likes shooting, even if they're not an expert marksman or hunter. Most of the devices are simple enough to be built even by a non-scientific thinker. This book could be a great alternative for those who live in areas of the world where there are stringent regulations concerning firearms and air guns as the infamous potato cannon is most likely unregulated in a lot of locales. Even if you never build any of the things described in the book (which I probably wouldn't) the book is still fun to read as it is entertaining and it provides some information on the history and major contributors in the field of physics. This is a book that the whole family could enjoy. Happy spud launching!"
2,Disappointing,"You can search the net and find as much and more.Was disappointed in this from start to finish, save your money."
4,Great Book on Ballistics for the Home projects,The book was good for my grandson who loves to blow things up! The book gave enough of a variety to keep him busy with different interesting projects.
5,Fun Book for Big Kids and Little Kids,This book I had as a child and can't find it so we wanted to get it for our 11 year old son's birthday. Lots of fun science experiments - we will have fun!
3,$30?,$30 for a 12 pack?Are you serious?Trader Joe's sells 4 packs for $3.And that's about all they are worth.
5,Boylan's Black Cherry Rocks!,Treat yourself and your loved ones to a vintage treat!You won't regret it.
3,Disappointing,Cookies are good. Was not happy that there was not an expiration date on them. Won't be purchasing them again.
3,not the right book,people who like strange and different thing will like is book.it just wasn't my kind of book
2,Very Poorly Organized,"This is one of the most poorly laid out language books I have studied from. First of all, I would like to state that languages are not my forte and I am not a natural at linguistics. Vietnamese is the fifth language I have studied and this book has made it most frustrating. The vocabulary is scattered all over each chapter rather than concisely at the beginning or end like better organized books. The glossary often does not have words the reader is looking for when they have forgotten them chapters later. There are also a few typographical errors in the answer key which further confuse the student.Also, table of contents only lists the titles of the chapters and does not list subtopics or chapter objectives. So if the student wants to reference a certain language point, he/she has to remember which chapter it was from then comb the chapter to find it."
1,Colloquial Vietnamese 2 CD set,"This CD course NECESSITATES the accompanying book, but they are not sold together as a single product. I have the Cambodian version and found it very good as a continuation after learning basic Khmer by other methods. I still chased down the book online though to maximize the benefit."
3,Beginners view,"I have studied foreign languages formally and on my own. The book I found useful. However, the tapes are virtually useless to me because I only have time to listen to them in my car and the tapes offer no english translation. In other words, since I am a beginner, I do not know what I am listening to on the tapes. Thus, as a package, I felt I paid too much."
2,Good for a second course of study only,"For a true beginner this course is not truly user-friendly. I have been to Viet Nam and was married to a native in Ho Chi Minh City. This series did nothing to prepare me to communicate in the language. The tonal system is not explained, practiced, or heard in the attempts given. Vietnamese without true tonal understanding is unintelligible. The audio version leaps into full conversation with little to no preparation. It was necessary to take another course in a classroom type setting to understand what this series was trying to get across. The book is fine, but one would need a native speaker to record the lessons in lieu of the audio portion."
3,Book good - tapes bad,"I'm afraid ""Colloquial Vietnamese"" is not one of the better lessons in this series. The book is quite good in the sense that it introduces the student to basic phrases that one might use in real life situations. Unfortunately, the content on the tapes is quite minimal and their relationship to the book is rather haphazard. As a result, the student gets some Vietnamese sound practice but has to guess the sound and tones on many sections. I compensated for this by having a native speaker read parts of the text alound into a tape recorder, but if this lesson had been better designed, I would not have to do this. You can definitely learn Vietnames from this book but it is not as good as others in this series."
3,PRONUNCIATION?,"This book offers a lot of useful words and phrases, but for the person who has never studied Vietnamese before, these words and phrases become very hard to learn, as Vietnamese pronunciation is almost skipped over at the beginning of the book. Having skimmed through the book, it looks to have a very good content, but this is brought down by the lack of explanation of vowels and tones. For someone who has had to study both Thai and Chinese before, the lack of pronunciation provided a major barrier to this language, which in itself is not impossibly hard to learn. If you can find a good introduction to reading Vietnamese, then this book would give a solid base to learn this language well."
2,Inappropriate content,I'm using this book and tapes/CDs under the guidance of a language instructor in a one-on-one situation and I find it woefully lacking. Both the content and the pace of introduction of new vocabulary are inappropriate. Why would one expect to be speaking with a diplomat in the second lesson of a language instruction series? There is no model for pronunciation at the start of the CD/tapes other than a very quick series of vowel sounds that are far too quickly presented and inadequately explained. I've asked my language lesson provider to find a different text to use.
2,"A classic, but....","I know this book is a classic, but I did not enjoy it. Though I liked Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, Farewell to Arms seemed rather boring. It gives a realistic and fairly hopeless view of war, revealing of Hemingway's own experiences. The soldier and the nurse's love affair is also autobiographical, but somehow has an unrealistic quality. Maybe I just don't like the nurse's characther, disregarding her own identity. The action is pretty slow and though the ending is foreshadowed, it felt more like a chopping off of a story than a closing. Overall, some interesting themes and classic messages about human nature, but a slow and terse writing style."
3,Where's the picture?,"It is hard, no make that impossible to purchase an item on line without picture! This company makes reputable products, however, on other sites (I won't mention your competitors' names) I can print a picture with the price, compare and buy wisely, informed."
2,Better at Describing the Problem than Providing the Solution,"Anderson provides an easy-to-read book here, giving anyone who has an overloaded, exhausting schedule sympathy and understanding. He describes the problems of emotional exhaustion very well, whetting the appetite of the reader for answers. Sadly, in the second half of the book on recovery he doesn't provide them well. He describes solitude, prayer, the Bible, spiritual direction, sorrow and joy as traits a person should have to recover from and to avoid emotional exhaustion, but doesn't relate them to one another. He also shows the reader where he needs to be, but does very little to help him get there.I've read much better books on emotional/spiritual exhaustion. Unless you are a fan of the author, I'd encourage you to pass on this one. The title is catchy, but it is all downhill from there."
1,"Tav's ""sparks"" die down","Tav is a writer but not a poet! the book is like a taggled web poetry. that he shook up and prayed to his ""higher power"" to let it work out! i'm quite disapointed that this is his ""vitage"" work. it makes me wonder was he that desperate to put another book out there he dug deep into his journels and pulled out this!"
3,Too many commercials,"The videos themselves are fine, we've seen them all before on Nickolodeon, and that's what I wanted. BUT, I must agree with the other reviewer who commented on the commercials before the episodes start. They are absolutely ridiculous, last 10 minutes and you can't forward through them. I won't be buying another one of these dvds because of them."
4,Love Olivia!,"My daughter can watch this dvd over and over and over again. I must say, I enjoy the episodes also. I only wish the dvd was longer. It came super quick though. Totally satisfied!"
5,A great choice,A great choice for those wanting to go into the field. It goes hand in hand with the book Dog In Blue
1,Not Worth It,"I only gave it one star because there was no option for zero stars. The program is on a CD rom, but it takes an average of 2 minutes for the program to respond after EACH question. At this rate I'll be studying for the exam for YEARS! The explinations of the correct answer to the questins is shallow and doesn't fully explain the reasoning. I'd never buy another product by Kay Payne again."
4,Very fine 'missing link' pop album,"Not the bluesy Dana Gillespie, but fascinating for that. This album is an interesting hybrid of various pop strains at the time ('67/68). Great to hear Jimmy Page playing more pop (just for contrast!), and songs by the kinda forgotten but good Brian Nicolls. A little bit top heavy with production at times, but it is INTERESTING production/arrangement I think. In the end, she comes across here almost like a lower voiced, somewhat sultrier & 'transatlantic' Jackie deShannon. That's fine with me-- and the inclusion of fine 'cool pop' version of Richard Farina's ""Hard Lovin' Loser"" almost makes the album worthwhile on its own. Great '60's stuff."
3,Sharp needs to release a higher capacity battery...,"What can I say? It's the same battery that comes with the Zaurus (I own the 5500). It has the same battery life, weight and everything else as the one you probably already own. It is very nice to have an extra battery on hand, as the Zaurus chews through these batteries like Homer chews through donuts.But, as for a review of the battery itself, I'd have to give it a so-so review. The battery life of the Zaurus is quite brief. Though, it didn't weigh into my decision of buying a Zaurus, I do wish Sharp would release a higher capacity battery so that I could have more than 3-4 hours of continuous battery life for a single battery.If you desperately need that back up battery now, then definitely buy this. You know what you're getting. But, I'd hold out for Sharp to possibly release a better battery; if you can."
5,This is the original Sharp battery,"This is the battery to order for Sharp Zaurus replacement. It is an exact replacement. After bad experiences with after-market clones, this original model worked perfectly. (Great price, too!)"
4,Zaurus battery.,"I think the battery is fine, but the Sharp Zaurus is power hungry. A spare battery may be a necessity if you plan to use your Zaurus all day, every day."
4,Fast Delivery,"This product arrived faster than I expected and was a product of JAPAN unlike everything else(Made in China, 99% of product in the US)."
1,Sharp Zaurus EA-BL06 battery,"Although displayed in accessories as a Minolta Xi compatible battery as a replacement for the battery that comes with the camera, it is not and I had to return it."
2,Cheap; didn't last long under normal use,"After a little over a year, my power cord died. $80 for a replacement seems a little steep. That said, when it does work, it is quite cool. No more laptop a flyin' across the room when the dog decides to go on one of his maniacal tears through the house."
3,Quite Easy To Use...Quite Easy To Break...,"When I first used the MagSafe power adapter for my MacBook Pro, I was thrilled! It is really easy to use and the magnetic end just snap into place...when your laptop is charging, the MagSafe indicator light turns green then red. Everything was fine until it stopped working...the indicator no longer lights up! I went to the Apple message board and quite a number of users were having the same trouble; as it turns out, the malfunctioning was caused by the golden pins on the magnet end. Two of the golden pins were stuck and it wouldn't reset itself! I called AppleCare and they promised to send a replacement for it...So to conclude, I like the technology behind the MagSafe power adapter, but it should not malfunction just after 2 weeks of use! I hope Apple will look into this matter and try to fix the defection asap!"
5,Great Portability,"I'm not sure why I see so many reviews about the end fraying or defects - mine has worked fine for the past 3 months and the cable is just fine. Charges up rather quickly, and I like that there's an extension that I can leave at home."
3,Not bad. A quick read.,"Not a bad read but I like WHAT COPS KNOW better. Quick, short stories that are easy to slip in on a lunch break."
4,Interesting read,This was an interesting book. It was a fascinating look into a world most of us never see. Should be required reading for criminals so they realize that the police will not give up and every crime has evidence left behind.
4,repair311,"This product is great for getting the current weather at home or traveling to the marina, before you get on the water. I haven't needed to call SeaTow for help yet. It leaves me with a sense of insuranceon the water.Rick Wisz, Pequannock, NJ"
5,Exactly what I needed,A great size for packing and a very sturdy little radio. Great to keep with you as a last resort while snowmachining/hunting in bush Alaska.
2,Not enough information,"I am brand new to options so after reading the reviews I thought this book would be perfect for me. But, there just wasn't enough examples or enough information in this book. I don't feel like I am any closer to starting to trade options. I have so many questions and this book did not answer any of them."
5,Hope you have time,"The whole Russians series is well worth getting. They are slow at times, but they always pick up in the end. There's a lot of groundwork that needs to be laid b/f the politics and intrigue can make sense.The characters are interesting though. Phillips and Pella do fairly well writing duo."
5,Intriguing...You must read the entire series.,"I have always loved Russian history, and I found these books an excelent way to learn more about it. After reading the series, I got the opportunity to visit St.Petersburg, Russia where much of the story takes place, and I was amazed at how accurate the books had been in history and setting. The books are so well written that you feel like you are part of the story. The characters seem like your best friend and you never want to put the books down. I found myself reading in eery spare moment I had and before I read these books, I hated to read. These are great books for teenagers to read because of their clean content. You will not be disappointed."
5,Excellent book!,"This is an awesome book I took AP Chem last year but didn't take the test and am planning to this year. Considering I haven't had any Chemistry for over a year, I thought I'd be in trouble, but this book is the best review I've ever seen. It almost teaches the whole subject of Chemistry, in an easy, straight to the point manner.If you're taking the AP Chem Exam this book is a MUST."
4,Missing key information,"This book is very good, but misses key information from time to time. During the AP test, I came across questions that were never even discussed in this book, and those were mandatory part II questions. Not good to be omiting stuff like that. But overall still a good buy"
2,"Poor Audio, Nice Cord","Bought this at Radio Shack a while back, liked the look of it and I like how it fits in my hand, but it just has poor (muffled) sounding audio, as tried on several different radios.Not really a loss though, I took the nice mike cord off and used it to fix another mike. (6 conductor cord.)Spend $3 more and buy the HG M75 power mike, that one works much better."
4,The prequel Tomie fans have been waiting for!,"This was what I have been waiting for!To see Tomie's origins!It was a very good movie. The acting was amature and the movie, low budget, but it really adds in some information for us Tomie fans. The Tomie actress in this movie was adorable. The plot was great and it wasn't necessarily a scary horror film, just good.I'd suggest anyone who read the Tomie manga see this movie as well.:D A great addition to your collection!"
3,Smoked Salmon Gift Box,"I gave this product as a gift to some clients as a change from Dean and DeLuca...not a good idea..My clients loved the gift box, the crackers etc. were very good...BUT, the smoked salmon was not high quality.I would not suggest this item for the food, but the box is nice."
3,Can You Say...Self-Aggrandizing??,"This is my least favorite of Jong's novels. The heroine, Leila Sand, is thoroughly baffling; too arrogant to be likable, too appeasing & long-suffering to seem hateful, not easy to relate to or sympathize with. There's no ""rootin' interest"" here...Leila drinks, drugs, paints, gallivants and occasionally plays with her twins. The Twelve-Step talk is heavy-handed, doesn't translate well here and comes off all wrong somehow. There are so many dangling story lines that there's no closure or relief in sight.Having said all that, I read it cover to cover in one sitting, never lost interest, enjoyed the satellite characters & got off on some of the humor. Jong at her worst will do this much for me. So it's an okay read. But nowhere near the integrity and poignance of Fear of Flying, Parachutes & Kisses and How to Save Your Own Life. Not even close."
4,Jong Makes Me Smile Again,"I've read this book several times over the last ten years. I adore her decriptions of her lust of men, sex, & love. Her prose is shockingly graphic, yet soft. After first reading this years back, I knew I'd never look at a man on a bike (motorcycle) the same way again. <grin>I won't give a summary of the book- amazon does that already. But pick it up @ your local bookstore & start with the first page. My guess is that you'll eagerly buy it & find it hard to put down.It's great reading such liberating literature. Such fun to delve into her naughtiness.Try this timeless erotic tale."
2,Disappointing,"There is some intelligence and a few flashes of insight here but on the whole, Jong has created a thin world that revolves around implausible sex. There is something excessive and fantasy-driven and predictable about the way the main character portrays her relationship with the younger man, as well as her portrayal of subsequent liaisons towards the end of the book. I had heard so much about FEAR OF FLYING but thought I would read the less-famous work first. Now, I am less inclined to read FEAR OF FLYING. This should have been an in-depth look at one woman's obsession, an intelligent treatment of lust and sex, but it was simply vacuous. It reminded me of Joan Collins with a bit of an effort at `social observation.'"
4,"Good, but head comes off too easily","I got this for my oldest son as a birthday present. Unlike his Justice League figures, which are somewhat durable, the 10"" Robin figure's head tends to come off too easily - and putting it back on is difficult."
3,"Nice, but they do fall apart pretty easy.","We don't have Robin but we do have Starfire. I read another review on here about the heads coming off easily, and I know it is true on Starfire. After just a few days of my daughters having it, not only did her head fall off all the time, but she falls apart at the waist, also."
2,A little disappointed,"Are we talking about the same cd? This cd is not what I expected. It was somewhat slow and boring. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate and am actually into slow, melodic, seductive music, but this cd just did not seem to go anywhere. There are one, maybe 2, acceptable tracks, but beside that, stick to the other F242 cds. And don't let the names of the remixers fool you on this one."
2,Ambient? KEEP IT AWAY!,"For some reason, ambient never did anything to me. I would just sit there, wondering why the hell other people liked it. If you like ambient, go right ahead. Otherwise, the other F242 albums will suit you better."
4,Introductory to a new kind..,"Kicked Outta Purgatory is a wonderful introductory to Physcobilly and all of its wonders. The tracks are well spread out and new comers may stick to safer grounds and stay on the first ten tracks for a while but eventually will move on. With tracks from such artists as The HorrorPops, 12 step Rebels, Koffin Katz, and Mad sin it is definitly a must have for someone looking to expand their musical tastes."
5,Great Book needs a sequel,i loved this book my brother loved it my mom loved this book even my grandma loves this book. it ends in a cliffhanger so i've been waiting for a sequel. please make a suequel!
2,Low quality / VERY basic,"I found the book to be very basic and of low quality. The scripts that the book came with sounded like your typical telemarketer. (The boring type you usually hang up on) The tips were also nothing special: things like saying ""thank-you"" after calls. There are also very hard to believe statistics thrown scattered throughout the book. Example: ""it is not unusual to see 5%, 10%, and even 30% response rates"" in regards to e-mail marketing.The (very) few nuggets in the book are scattered around without any real organization.Find something else. You can do much better for a telemarketing book, and probably at half the price."
5,Thank you Ann Barr ! You saved my job!!,"This book saved my job.....I have been in sales for over 7 years but I had no experience selling medical supplies over the phone. I had a horrible sales territory. No training from my company and I was put on 60 day performance review. At the time, my achievement torwards my sales quota was 58%. After reading Ann Barr's book, I achieved 85%+ thereafter. I am no longer on warning. I was able to raise my GP, raise my average order, and closed $100,000 account over the phone. My confidence is back and I have fun selling over the phone. Not only did it provide the skills to be successfull but gave me ideas that help seperate me from my competition. Thank you Ann!"
5,Good book to touch-up on the whole sales process,"Every sales person must keep up with the ""new"" styles of sales calls and techniques this book help with excellent written worksheets and great added value."
4,Interesting,"I've read Kody Scott's 'Monster' and Terrell Wrights 'Home of the Bodybags' all great reads and this is no exception. Book kept me interested and I finished it pretty quickly.for anyone who reads these gangbanger autobiographys, you will enjoy this one."
2,Inside the Crips,"This book is by and large a terrible read. The editing is poor and the story suffers from it. The book is hard to read, do to the inability of the author or the editors to maintain the characters identities. For instance Monster Kody the author of his own auto-biography is refered to as Big Buster, Monster Ken and Monster Kody. Sometimes various gang monikors applied to a single character appear in consecutive paragraphs leaving the reader confused forcing you to scramble back and verify that you have not missed a sentence or two. The same occurs when the identity of Huckabuck from the Rollin 60s is merged with a character of the same name from Harlem 30s. When Huckabuck is discussed and later dies, the reader is not informed which of the two characters we are reading about. I would suggest buying this book at a discounted price or check it out of the library but don't waste your money buying it at full price."
5,Inside The Crips,Colton Simpson takes the reader on an incrediable journey that opens the ghetto's and leads you into the heart of gang warfare. It is descriptive and heart-wrenching. The insight into the Californian Jail system is appaling. This book is a must read for those wanting to understand the African American street struggle.
1,Not Good,Colton Simpson is a poor man's Monster Kody Scott. Read Monster if you want to read a real Crip Book.
4,Used as a signal combiner,"I have multiple (3) over-the-air TV antennas pointed at the various surrounding locations where the broadcast stations have placed their antennas and needed a way to combine all those signals so that my DVR and four TVs could access any channel at any time without needing to operate an antenna roter and could record or watch multiple channels at once regardless of their location. I use a pair of these as combiners to bring all three HDTV signals together and then distribute an amplified signal out to all of the tuners in various rooms of my house. The only thing better would be a 3-way combiner, but I haven't found one of those yet."
2,Does not combine signal very well,"I purchased this product with hopes of combining my antenna signal with my analog cable box in order to get local HD channels on a secondary TV without having pay my cable company for another HD box. When I installed the combiner I immediately noticed a degraded signal especially from the cable box. The picture from the cable box signal was especially snowy. I tried several fixes to clean the signal but nothing worked. I removed the combiner and installed a switch and the signal from both sources is much cleaner (no snow) -but now I have to get up, walk over to the TV and slide the switch when I want to change from local HD channels to the cable box channels. I did not evaluate the splitting function of this device."
3,Does not work with DISH,"Worked fine with the digital antenna, but mostly static with DISH network. Not worth the cost to pay for return postage."
3,splitter,"It is probably is good as any other splitter, but I purchased this item thinking that I could use it going in from 2 antennas or antenna/cable and out to my tv splitter, however that just isn't the case. That is not the way they work!"
5,combiner,"This worked very well, works great with dish. If you want to combine your regular over the air channels and the dish network feed."
3,HUGE!,"I guess I didn't read the product description very well, this spoon is 20"" long and the handle diameter is at least 1/2"". Very sturdy at least, but I'm considering sawing off 4-6""."
5,AWESOME dvd - tons of info & fun to watch,"Amazing DVD with lots of fishing pros presenting interesting information along with helpful advice & tips on how to catch more fish and how to go after the monster size fish. Not just another boring technical video, they put it together in a way where you enjoy watching it even several times. It is also separated into several chapters so you can just watch certain ones depending on what type of fishing trip you heading off to next. Its even got some bonus features on top of the over 3 hours of video. I always liked Rapala lures for their quality and they kept up their reputation with this top class DVD. Overall it is a nice balance of tips, entertainment, and knowledge."
2,Marked up a LOT even though sold as new condition.,"The book was clearly used and in only good condition, not ""as New"" and I say this because of the notes and underline marking, sometimes of whole paragraphs, where heavy throughout the first quarter of it, and more sporadic later on. It was in pencil but should have been noted by the seller.I NEVER give negative feedback, and would have let this go, but Amazon nagged me to DEATH on this, and I don't appreciate that! I will order from this seller again, most likely, but I will definitely ask more questions."
3,Too long and too liberal,"Author loves to coin words and long phrases. Book is more than twice as long as it should be. His very liberal bias is annoying. Too much focus on the envirionment and how corporations are killing us for their greed. Far too simplistic of an analysis. He belives that unlimited sums should be spent to save just one life or one tree. He does not agree with cost/benefit analysis. However, buried in his excess wordage are many very good points, so book is good for gaining perspective on many naughty things going on in government. It makes one wonder about honesty in government (is there any?)."
1,Luddite Nonsense,"Regurgitated Luddite foolishness from an economic ignoramus. This is the worst kind of populism, based not in love but in fear: ""He is really big, but if you and I get together we can bop him."" Mix that with the leitmotif of intellectuals (""How unfair that people like Jack Welch have influence: what were his grades in high school?"" and ""What a better place the world would be if we were in charge!"") and you get the picture. It is amazing to me that this stuff still has an audience."
4,Worth to read even if you are not an US citizen.,"Interesting and very instructive although a bit biased toward a liberal focus. It's worth reading even if you are not an American voter. The US is following the trend of the Roman Empire and is no longer a Republic but an Empire dominated by a President empowered like a 'Caesar'. If those are the results in the country that once gave birth to modern Democracy, just imagine what is happening in your own country ..."
5,A fine novel that became a classic western film,"This thrilling novel of divided loyalties is about a white boy who was raised by the Sioux after his family was wiped out by Comanches during an attack on their wagon train. The lad is later adopted by the chief who raises him as his own son, which complicates matters when the Indians and soldiers go to war which results in the battle at the Little Big Horn. Young Jim Aherne's relationship with two youngsters from the wagon train plays a large part in the development of the story which also has a romantic angle to complicate matters at a cavalry outpost. The book was filmed in 1952 as ""The Savage"" which starred Charlton Heston in one of his first major roles in his storied film career. Author L. L. Foreman's book is one of the best fictional works written about the old west."
5,Little '59 - Neck and Bridge Wounds,"The bridge-wound '59er kicks out a powerful signal, yet delivers a clean treble response with good presence. The individual pole pieces line up well with the string spacing at the bridge position when using a strat or hardtail type bridge. The neck-wound unfortunately maintains the pole spacing of the bridge-wound, so alignment is off in the middle and gets worse at the neck.I installed a Little '59er at the bridge and two Cool Rails in the middle and neck, but found the Cool Rails to be treble-anemic. I replaced them with two Carvin TBH60s and there is now a great balance in tone and volume across the 5-way."
1,Forget UnbeatableSale Inc.,"From Amazon via Unbeatable Sales I ordered Waechtersbach Christmas Tree 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4 to add to my existing collection. The box showed up with NO dinner plates and one broken bowl. I called them and they said they would have to check with the warehouse to verify. A week later they said ""Oh, we are out of the dinner plates and didn't know if they would get anymore."" They said I could get 4 Square plates or return the order for a refund. Christmas had already come and gone and no packing material left, so I had to settle for square plates. The sensible thing would have been to notify the customer before sending anything. Why would they send out a partial shipment and say nothing? Hoping I wouldn't notice! Square plates mixed in with other settings of round plates looks weird!"
2,Buyer beware - it's not an AC adapter.,"There isn't much information on the detail page, so it's very easy to make the mistake I made and think that it's an AC adapter for the Zaurus. It's not. You have to take the battery -out- of the Zaurus to charge it with this charger. That forces the Zaurus onto backup-battery power, which doesn't last long. So this charger is completely useless unless you want to buy a second battery, which is another fifty bucks."
5,Everybody's Favorite Folksinger at his best !,"I have been an Arlo fan for a few years. He is probably the nicest guy I have ever met, and is the greatest musician I have ever seen. This album is his most popular one and maybe his best. Another good one is his second one(and this is his first may I say) simply titled ""Arlo.""It is a live album."
1,Only Arlo Guthrie Could Do This,"Allice's Restaurant Massacre was a classic hippie comedy piece from the late '60's.A rambling story of the era.How a simple visit to Alice's Restaurant turns into the largest crime in over 50 years in a small New England town.A simple story put to music that will have you in stiches for 20 plus minutes.The phrase ""You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant, excepting Alice."" will be deeply planted in your head.The remaining songs are typical hippie/folk songs you would expect from the era.Arlo Guthrie's father, Woodie Guthrie, a folk music artist and wrote the classic ""This Land Is Our Land""."
2,eh...,"not very good. but i heard that title track for the FIRST time the other day--apparently, everyone else on the planet has heard it hundreds of times--and i was won over momentarily. i soon found the CD used for $4.99 and decided to pick it up. there are unfortunately two skips in ""alice's restaurant"" and the rest of the stuff is forgettable. ah well."
5,"You liked the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!!","Arlo's great song about his friend Alice's restaurant not only is a hit on it's own terms, it was made into a wonderful movie which turned the song into a reality.This movie soundtrack features Arlo's creative works and features folk greats such as Pete Seeger (performing Woody Guthrie's ""Pastures of Plenty"" & ""The Car Song"") and Joni Mitchell's ""Songs to Aging Children"" performed by Tigger Outlaw.Who can forget Arlo's adventures of the Thanksgiving dinner (that couldn't be beat) at Ray and Alice's church in Housatonic, Mass. This CD makes wonderful traveling music and is recommended to Arlo fans young and old alike."
3,Not the Soundtrack,"Amazon lists this as the soundtrack but it is in fact Arlo's original album. The soundtrack I had on vinyl and included the great song by Joni Mitchell ""Song's to Ageing Children"". But this is still the better deal because the version of Alice's Resturant on the original album is better than the version done for the actual movie soundtrack. And, yeah, that song is the only reason to get the album."
4,Music,I liked this album back in the day and I still enjoy it today. It shows the big changes we have gone through in like.
2,alices restaurant,Did not have the version i was looking for. The recording sound is not up to pare. Would have preferred a better recording.
4,good design great audio & mod.,As a mobile mike on the road it's a value leader. A good mike with adjustable mike gain . A little patience on the road to learn the right gain needed produces good modulation. Every radio is different. And the mike gain adjustment is great.
4,"Nice, OK","It's alright, but it's hard to beat a noise cancelling mic, if you get a good one, but I like this mic also, tips, and guidelines, I tell it like I feel it is"
2,cobra hg-m75 power mike mods,when i hooked this mike you to my cobra 18wx II stock the mike didn't make much difference over the original factory mike i then modified the cobra hg m-75 power mike replacing the two resistors one of them gets taken out and install a jumper r-6 and replace r-7 with a 1/8 watt 220 ohm resistor and replace the capacitor c-1 with a 0.47uf other wise the stock capacitor will leave the mike sounding flat be careful about soldering the connections that you don't short out the resistors or the capacitors and be careful about reassembly enjoy i only have to put my mike up to 4 an it's blowin smoke and its loud all ready at that point keep on truckin****
4,Good mike great price!,"I dont think you can beat a good CB power mike for under $20. I'm using it on my Galaxy DX959 SSB rig and am getting good audio reports on SSB with a comment of ""a little midrangy"". Thats not a bad thing when punching through noise. The big bonus with this mike is the design of it. It looks like something you would find in a helicopter cockpit. Very aeronautic with is bulging wind screen and red led that lights on transmit to give you a battery indicator. The transmit switch is easy on the fingers and the general design is well thought out for a mike in this price range. Audio level adjust is at the rear top of the mike like the old Turner +2. Great value."
3,A Beginner Who Tried The Video,"I am a beginner who tried this tape because of the wonderful reviews. In my opinion, it moves too fast from one pose to another. By the end of the workout, the poses become difficult and look hazardous for the back and neck. I found the narrator very distracting...describing the different poses with a clinical tone in the voice. My desire in a yoga tape is to bring strength and inner peace - so - this tape does not meet this ""newbee's"" needs. My recommendation would be using Suzanne Deason for an introduction to yoga."
5,Excellent yoga,I have the original and fire. This one is very relaxing to me and I love it. I did start with easier versions of yoga before doing this one. Starters on this one will need to watch it first to get the flow and terminology. doing some of these poses at first was a big challenge but after about a month I could do all of them no problem. I do recommend any of these dvd's.
5,one of my favorite workouts for creating that ZEN feeling...,"I had to review this when I saw there were some poor reviews. I bought this DVD a year ago and it remains one of my favorite yoga workouts. It completely stretches you out and is super relaxing. The pace is perfect, not too slow, not too fast. I love it."
5,Excellent Video for Beginners,"For years, I've been recommending either Total Yoga (1992) or Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Stamina Version. Now that Tracey Rich and Ganga White have put out the three Flow Series tapes, I now recommend the Water version of the Flow Series to beginners in decent shape. If you are over weight, have old injuries, or haven't exercised in decades, then get the first level tape - Earth. But for most people just looking to get started in a flowing yoga style, nothing beats this Water tape. It's forty-five minutes of a safe, well-rounded program. If you want a 20-minute, not as well-rounded program, then get the Stamina Version of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga. I am so glad these two finally made more tapes. I just wish they'd hurry up and get the whole thing on DVD. Anyway, if you want more of a challenge and like to sweat, get the Fire version or check out David Swenson's Yoga Short Forms.Oh yea, one more thing. Be safe and watch any video at least once before you just jump in.Enjoy!"
2,Not an intense yoga workout.,I have been doing yoga regularly and I am not very happy with this cassette. As pointed out by the other reviews the poses are few and they are not held for long or it moves too slowly. I was particularly disappointed with the sun salutations as I felt they were not repeated enough.This might be good for beginners and people who have already practiced yoga may want to go for something more intense.
3,Serenity,"Total Yoga ""Water"" begins with deep cleansing breaths and progresses into a flowing series of postures. The pace is perfect for beginners or intermediate practitioners, however there is an advanced pose called ""Fish"" that may present quite a challenge. What I liked most about this workout is the time given for each posture. When doing the Seated Forward Fold, they give enough time to relax fully into the pose. You may also recognize Camel, Boat, Triangle and Dophin pose. The mood is very relaxing with a desert setting and a backdrop of clouds. This workout leaves you feeling refreshed and relaxed as there is an extended session at the end where you can meditate and relax fully.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Intermediate??,"The description of this video says that it is for intermediate students of yoga. I consider myself to be an intermediate; I do Bryan Kest regularly, so I can keep up pretty well. I have to say that this ""workout"" was one of the easiest things that I have done. There was no effort involved and none of the poses were held long enough to really feel anything. Maybe it's because I'm used to a more power-type yoga session, but this was literally ""no sweat."" I'm giving this to a friend."
1,Total crapola,"You can skip this one. It was just a waste, too fast the background is white and they wear blue, it is too literal and the workout is a waste. for me anyway, I like to feel the burn and I like to feel like I accomplish something when I do a workout. I was very disappointed!"
5,Roswell Season 1-3,"Roswell is a wonderful series about 4 teenagers who came to earth from another planet. It stars a number of young actors who portray love, drama, and awkwardness. In short, they look and act like normal teenagers. The four characters, Max, Michael, Isabel, and Tess have tremendous powers, but do not understand where they came from or how they got there. Roswell, was the sight of the famous UFO sighting in 1947. This fact adds to the mystery that surrounds these teens. The series is appropriate for pre-teens, teens and adults. The series is very enjoyable and well worth the money."
5,Max and Liz ROCK!,"Roswell in my opinion is the greatest tv series that ever graced television, it captures everything, Love, friendship, drama, science fiction and more! i would recommend anyone to buy the 3 seasons in one set as it always keeps you wanting more and what could be better than having the whole lot to watch at your own discression.Max and Liz ROCK!"
4,Rosewell,"I've become a little obsessive about the series Rosewell. In the beginnig it is a real retelling of the Tragedy of Romeo and Julliet, complete with balcony scenes, which they allude to in the series. Very powerful and in these days not believable, the writers going to extremes to have the main characters not consumate their relationship, including a time travel expisode to stop them. Still, I like the main characters well enough to continue on to find out what happens. The later part of the series the Sci-Fi takes over, but the establishment of the earlier rapport between the viewer and the cast allows the story to be carried forward with the viewer's intrest not diminishing. I like the series."
4,"ICaps Lutein & Zeaxanthin Formula, Coated Tablets, 120 coated tablets","Good duct for your eyes on a smaller budget.Tried it, loved it and will order it again from Pharmapack"
5,The best of Amazoon Service/Card services suck,"The order with Amazon went better than expected but got credit card involved and tried over several days to activate and was told each time number did not exist, Contacted credit card affiliate and was told to try that 3 or four times and a rep would come on to finalize activation. This is the most riduious thing I have ever encountered with a card. I kept trying to communicate with these people but finally told them to cancel card. I will continue to do busines with Amazon but withou your featured card. I realize you donot control credit card operations but they do carry your name on the card.Thanks for giving me the opportunity to discuss this with some caring individuals that could maybe go to the upper crust of the major credit card company and let them see loop holes they carry unknowingly.Bob Love"
3,Nauseated Feeling,"I have been taking these pills off and on. If I don't keep my stomach filled for a couple hours after I take them I get nauseated and it lasts at least half the day. Sometimes even if I keep eating I still feel bad, so I am not wanting to take them every day. I am sure they work great, but until I get the nauseous feeling under control, I am going to be in the dark as to how they will work with me. I had LASIK surgery a few years ago so I was hoping these pills would be good for my eyes."
5,Icaps coated tablets,"I have been using these for more than six months and it does seem to make my eyesight clearer.My Opthamologist recommended them to me.THE ONLY BAD THING: has been ordering from Amazon. Every order was DOUBLED. Why?On another I ordered the tablets and got the ""other"" which turned out to be very poor inquality and the capsules were distended as if stored in a warm place, causing them toappear to be spoiled."
2,some improvement,I can see alittle improvement but I was told that I need more thank 2-3 times the amount of lutein than is provided. It would be more cost effective to buy the lutein and zanthian separately
2,They don't seem to disolve,I hate to be indelicate but something about the coating used on the ICaps keeps them from disolving in my stomach. They seem to go straight through untouched. I will have to try them in some kind of smoothie I guess. Unfortunately my blender is loaned out to an elderly parent with cancer. Once I get access to a blender I will try taking these again but for now it literally is money down the drain.
5,excellent eye vitamins,"I bought this for my mother-in-law who's been having problems with one of her eyes which has been throbbing every now and then. She sometimes can't open that eye at all. I saw the good review about this eye vitamin and decided to give it a try. After she finished the first bottle, she felt a lot better. We couldn't be 100% sure that it was working but we decided to give it more try. So I have bought another bottle for her."
3,I Caps vitamins with Lutein,"Recommended for aging eyes- Can't tell exactly what's in the product- ordered 2 different ( I thought) items , both were the same"
5,Why take a chance if your Opthamologist says to take them?,"I've been taking this product for a couple of years. My opthamologist said to take THIS...and only this one. My sight is deteriorating, but I'll never know how much worse it might have been if I didn't take these I-Caps. And with Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" plan....it's the best price I can find anywhere...even when using the occasional coupon."
4,I am pleased,"I have been using I-Caps for a few months. My pleased to say that my chronic dry eye symptoms have diminished tremendously. I could not tolerate contact lenses before, but now I can wear them for almost a whole day. I plan to continue using this product."
1,Do not buy this Modem - Palm does not support it,"Where do I start? Instructions are poor and sparce. The phone number you call for modem hookup is in Madison Wisconsin. And its not toll Free!!! Expect to be connected with someone who does not understand English who will ask you (after holding for 30 minutes) if you have read the instructions. In all honesty, buy the minstel wireless modem. Don't make my mistake. They're service can't be worse and it can be used from anywhere. This is an honest review. The representative has said 4 times now that he will help (and had put me on hold). How can they not understand the product that they manufactured. Bottom Line...palm V is an excellent unit. The modem, however, is a waste of money. Do not buy it!"
5,"If you travel, you've gotta have this.","Thin, light, uses inexpensive batteries (AAA). Software is a dream; plug it in, press one button and you HotSync to your desktop from anywhere. Well worth it.Does anyone know where to get the GSM upgrade kit so you can use this with a cellphone or digital wireless phone?"
3,"Not Great, Not Bad, Just Mediocre","I picked up a couple of the special edition G5's on the clearance rack. Too good to pass up and I have always been a big fan of Logitech's mice.The Good----------------------Customized weighting of the mouseThe feel of the mouse like the Logitech mice of this time is greatThe mediocre---------------------I have never once had the need to adjust the senistivityThe teflon cord is not really a big dealI think the left button could be more sensitive...The Bad---------------------The wheel button is very wonky. Not only for accidentally toggling left and right, but also up and down. If you do not hit it just right... and I think the build quality of this model is subpar so the mechanical part of the mouse is not very solid.One side button. Not too bad, you can program all the other buttons so a forward function can be in the mix.Thoughts----------------------There are better mice out there (like the final rev of the G5 with two side buttons). Stay away from this one."
3,Nice mouse....but..,"...what I didn't like about it was the positioning of the 4th and 5th finger. They would end up being on a slant...half on/half off. After a couple hours of gaming, my hand was sore. For now I am using a standard $10 Microsoft optical mouse where both of those fingers are on the mouse pad..much more comfortable. The ideal comfort mouse is the Microsoft optical ergonomic wireless mouse...except the batteries going dead at the worse moment. I gave it a a middle of the road setting of a 3 stars due to comfort. However when playing Battlefield 2142, it was very nice being able to change the dpi on the fly. The wights were also very nice being able to customize how well it slides over the mouse pad."
5,G5 Gaming Mouse,"Well if you are looking at purchasing a G5 then you probably know all the Pros. The only Con that I can think of is that there is no Forward Button, only a Back. They fixed this in a later version of the mouse. Overall its an amazing mouse and is definitely worth the money."
5,Excellent Mouse,"Very fine mouse indeed. There is a newer version of G5 available, with an extra button, but this older version of G5 serves me very well, both in common tasks and in gaming. It is very precise and moving the mouse is smooth. I added a few grams of weight by the weight cartridge."
3,Logitech G5 Battlefield: Good,"This mouse works pretty well. I love the changing of sensitivity on the fly during games. The click wheel is a little too sensitive, or its just not grooved enough for a clean scroll every time during a gaming session. The Battlefield logo is probably the reason I got it for so cheap, but I guess I don't ever see it when I'm sitting at the computer ;)"
1,Totally unreliable,I am now on my second G5 gaming mouse. It is not the Battlefield 2142 model with the graphics but still the same mouse. The first one refused to work out of the box. I spent hours online researching the problem. I found another computer to test it on and also another mouse to verify my USB ports were working OK on my computer. I finally took it back and got an exchange. The second one worked for all of two weeks and then went dead. It lights up like the first one but will not move the pointer. I would not recommend this mouse to anyone unless they are willing to spend the time and hassle to buy then take it back for a full refund. I am sure it must work for some but two in a row is a record for me. It does feel and operate very well when it works although I did not get a chance to play with different configurations of weights. The weights seem more like a gimmick to me but I could be convinced with experience and feedback from other users.
