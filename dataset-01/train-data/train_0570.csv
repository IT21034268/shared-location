5,a rare treasure,"best Gilbert's solo cd ever, even the sound quality is not good as his other released. simply a must have."
3,Feel The Heat,"1974's Body Heat was Quincy Jones' first album that was straight mainstream r&b versus jazz. Although some heavy jazz hitters like Herbie Hancock, Bob James & Hubert Laws contribute, the main focus on the album is the vocals from the likes of Leon Ware, Minnie Riperton, Al Jarreau & Bernard Ighner. Mr. Ware makes big contributions to the album especially on the pillow jam title track. Ms. Riperton & Mr. Jarreau team up with Mr. Ware for some inspired vocal interplay on the slick ""If I Ever Lose This Heaven"". The album was a huge hit on the pop charts peaking at a career best number 6 for Mr. Jones."
5,Best The Best for Mellow groove!,"Credit is nothing. But, maybe I know great musicians. David T Walker:guitar, JamesGadson:dram, Chack Rainy:bass, Excellent super rhythm section!! Wonderful Mellow master Leon Ware!!! My favorite song in this album for ' If I ever lose this heaven' Body Heat is great a masterpiese!!"
1,I did not buy this product,I did not purchase this product. It is not clear to me why Amazon asks for a review from me!!!!
5,Casper Movies,"The casper movies I purchased for my son. He loves them. They came quick, brand new in shrink wrap."
4,School's (and Ghouls) in Session !,"Casper the Friendly Ghost, the friendliest ghost you know is back in this brand-new movie as seen on Cartoon Network. In it, little Casper is becoming too friendly to humans, especially his new friend, a boy named Jimmy. So his uncles, Stretch, Stinky, and Fatso enroll Casper in Scare School where monster children go to learn how to scare humans properly - not too little, not too much. Even though Casper makes a few new friends there, like a mummy boy named Ra and a zombie girl named Mantha, he still has to keep up the promises with his human friend Jimmy back in Deedstown. Meanwhile, the freaky faculty of Scare School has had it with their master, big boss ghost Kibosh. Seems there's something scary brewing up here, so I won't spoil the rest of the plot for you.This movie is very charming whether you get to see it for Halloween or whenever. Plus, there is a series based on this movie currently playing on Cartoon Network, too !"
2,I've smelled worse...,"Yikes, it's like the the play perfume I used to get in those cheap beauty kits when I was little, but with a slightly rancid after-scent. Gave it away to my 15-year-old niece who loves it."
4,"Great ""nuts and bolts"" game","Like its companion ""Baseball Mogul,"" Football Mogul is a game based in strategy and team-building rather than the rock 'em, sock 'em action of most games.You must not only keep your team playing well on the field, but must also make strategic business decisions that influence the team - do you sign the big-time free agent for megabucks and take a financial loss, or do you pray to land him via the draft? Do you even keep your draft picks, or trade them away for the established star? Do you raise ticket prices (and potentially alienate your fan base)? And what do you spend to keep your players healthy and on the gridiron? All these questions - and others - play a large role in the game.Football Mogul is a fabulous game if you were a fan of text-based simulations, and I'd recommend it. But if you're looking for a Madden-like experience, this one's not for you."
5,Boxcar Bertha a Great Movie,"Boxcar Bertha, based on the true story of ""Boxcar"" Bertha Thompson, features a dynamic young cast. Set in the Great Depression, this move shows, if somewhat romanticized, life of the southern railroad unionizer and an young orphan girl who fall in love. And how the unionizer and the girl, along with two other cronies turn to petty crime to survive. The climatic ending must be seen to be believed. Also if you are interested in steam era railroading, there are plenty of steam locomotive and train scenes to satisfy you. Not to mention the 24 year old Barbara Hershey is hot."
3,Early Scorsese,"This early effort by Martin Scorsese for low-budget legend Roger Corman manages to sustain interest, but it's only a glimmer of the genius to come. Bertha (Barbara Hershey) hooks up with labor agitator Big Bill Shelley (David Carradine); with their gang (Bernie Casey and Barry Primus) they pull off a number of robberies and find themselves on the run right up until the suitably bloody climax. This will be of interest to Scorsese completists and lovers of exploitative B-movies; others need not bother."
3,Sheila Rae The Brave,"I read, Sheila Rae the Brave. The reason I liked and would recommend Sheila Rae the Brave is because I liked the character Sheila Rae because she was brave and tough. In the book I read that she got her doll back from the big mean dog down the street by pulling it away from the dog."
4,Very pretty and very helpful,"My child had been convinced that she was shy. I kept telling her she was brave and then we read about Sheila Rae. Now, whenever she's acting a little nervous, I can sing quietly to her, ""I am brave. I am fearless."" A nice weapon in the battle against shyness."
4,Nice for Kids,"Sheila Rae, the Brave, written by Kevin Henkes, is a nice story for young children. My five-year-old brother enjoys himself very much with its CD-ROM version, including interesting animation, melodious song and a *treasure hunt* game.The story teaches us what the word *brave* really means. Sheila Rae thought that walking backwards with her eye closed, riding bicycle no-handed with her eyes closed, etc., were *brave*. Actually I prefer the word *foolish* to *brave*, because she might get hurt. On the contrary, Louise, his sister was called a *scaredy-cat*. However she was the one who save Sheila Rae from getting lost. She was the real *fearless* girl in the story.After all, I think Sheila Rae, the Brave is very fascinating, which is a great book for kids at the ages of 4-8."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book is not what I thought it would be. After reading several books from this same author, I thought the book would teach a lesson and be entertaining. Although the book has great illustrations and is quirky, I don't like how it goes about teaching a lesson on how to be brave. There are certain things to the story that I don't like and I don't think it would help kids. I even think it may be a little hard for young reader's to understand what the author point is."
3,A Tale of Comeuppance,"Sheila Rae, The Brave is one of the many titles in Henkes' series of mouse books. Sheila Rae prides herself in her ferocity. Unlike her younger sister Louise, Sheila seeks out the danger in the mundane and charges after it. One day, her adventure seeking backfires, and our heroine finds herself alone and in need of rescuing by Louise who proves that she too is brave. As always, Henkes' watercolor and ink mice have such expressive facial features and postures that they gently shed light on an individual's frailty without being jarring and encourage the reader to reflect and mature by living vicariously in their world. Consequently, Sheila Rae, The Brave could serve as an easily accessible exemplar of dynamic characterization and the characteristics of the hero cycle explained by Peter R. Stillman inIntroduction to Myth."
4,a positive spin on true bravery,"A little ""Girl"" (really mouse) learns that even those who are brave sometimes are not, and that those who don't think they are can be when they do things that are hard. I also like that the main characters are girls, showing that the brave ones aren't always brawny men."
3,Lowepro Off Trail 1,"Purchased for carrying my D80 w/ 18-200mm during hiking of the Grand Canyon. Don't think the side lens holders are of any real value -- don't intend to use them. Wide waist belt seems comfortable and sturdy buckle. Purchased only for hiking to keep my hands free. Otherwise, not a preferred everyday camera bag."
4,Great bag,"I needed a camera bag for hiking and traveling. My brother had one and I felt this would be the best choice. It's been a great bag for keeping out dust and other things, but the straps on the lens cases can get in the way. That's the only drawback I have seen. Great bag overall!"
3,Bag is ok for the price.,"I just bought a Nikon D40x and needed a bag for it, bought this one after reading all the great reviews. After receiving the bag, I really wasn't too impressed with it. First, there isn't any small pockets for your other gears, I knew this when I bought it, not too big of a problem, I'll be using one of the two lense case for those. The more serious problem with this bag is how it is made. I'm not sure if I have a defective bag, but the lining inside my bag's main compartment is uneven, as if when they were making the bag, they forgot to cut off the extra material, the result is an uneven inside. I'm still contemplating on whether I will keep this bag, who knows..."
2,fine for a small camera,this would be great for entry level slr with shorter lenses - doesnt fit my canon 40d with any of the zoom lenses - must return it.
1,Troy does not stand behind product- bad QC,"I recieved this weight set and could not use it because one of the main plates had a hole smaller than 2 inches. It would not fit on the bar, or 2 others i tried. Called Troy and got nowhere. They said to bring it back to amazon. Called the company that shipped it and they contacted Troy and said they got nowhere. So now i am out close to $500 bucks. I am pursuing legal avenues, but this is ridiculous. DONT DEAL WITH TROY!!!"
3,Decent equipment,Overall decent equipment. Only issue so far is paint on weights is beginning to flake off. Other than that fair to good equipment.
4,Seems to be a great product,"I just received the shipment today and based on my first expression, it seems to be a high quality product. The weights were in amazingly secure and strong package while the bar was packaged separately which could have used some padding inside the box to prevent scraches. But overall I am very pleased with Amazon, the product, packaging and delivery (there was a small glitch n delivery which was addressed propmtly). Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am not sure over time how the product will hold up."
4,The Donots Rock!,"I first saw these guys touring with Millencolin and they are really great! They are a successful mix of pop-rock, punk and have recently developed a much more raw, hardcore edge especially on this album.There are so many great tracks, opening with the straight up rock n roll anthem 'We got the Noise' right up to the attitude filled 'Punchline'. fans of great gutar music will be easily pleased, 'Knowledge' has a kick ass guitar solo and 'Life ain't Gonna Wait' opens up with an awesome riff! It's well worth looking ito these guys, they have a great knack for penning catchy rock songs and appeal to just about anyone"
4,"The Donots "" We Got the Noise""","A very well thought out album, with great guitar work. Especially on "" We Got the Noise"". There are some songs that aren't as good as the first song on the album, but overall it is a great album."
5,according to jim season 1,i never watched show when it was on weekly. now that is is on in reruns it's non stop laughter. the chemistry between the actors is great. larry joe campbell is hilarious.
3,So So..,"I remember watching some episodes on Disney Channel together with My Wife and Kids, which is too being released on dvd.I always liked but never really laughed.As i was watching the dvds as i always kinda tempted to watch something else and give it a chance.I guess it was ok, but nothing special.Are the episodes out order?Cheryl has a broken arm in a few episodes here and there which makes it strange...i mean its not like she broke her arm 5 times, so are the dvds our of production order or what?"
1,What an awful sitcom,"I purchased the first season and I was so disappointed. Maybe I'm not the right customer for this, I don't like Belushi so I can't like the show, and it doesn't help that the other characters aren't really nice.my mistake there are so many wonderful sitcoms out there, I had to choose one of the worst."
3,Scratches very easily,"I bought this set from Chef's Catalog 5 years ago. I really like the style, but I have to say the quality has been disappointing. I do not own a dishwasher, and haven't since I owned the set, and it is totally scratched and does not look very good. It is hard to believe it is 18/10 stainless steel. My mother's Betty Crocker sets have stood up much longer and better than Henckels--though the fact it is made in China definitely puts a different spin on it. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,shipping problem,"Whether one likes these is probably largely a matter of personal taste. One was broken on arrival. They were too cheap to bother returning, so I have no idea how Amazon would have handled a return. They were packaged in a box that offered no protection, and this box in turn was packed in a large box with an abundance of air pillow packaging. Unfortunately the packer put all the air pillow protection on one side of the box, so the original box was directly against one side of the large box and not protected at all. This was the first of many orders from Amazon to arrive in anything but excellent condition--maybe it was part time Christmas help."
5,Hamby shows the legacies of late 20th century POTUS,Hamby takes an in depth look at the good bad and ugly of each President with special focus n the legacies they left.
4,Ahh Mr Wakeman !!!,"Not as inspiring as Six Wives of Henry the 8th, but fun to listen to.Wakeman's ""Yes"" era was definately a major influence....and a great aural jouney...take the time to listen and enjoy !"
4,Rick Wakeman's best,"This album sounds very contemporary. Great vocal, diverse and higly dramatic musical themes - you will listen it again and again!The only serious drawback - mediocre quality of recording."
4,Rick is a wizard!,This album is quite interesting. Similar to his JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EATTH album Rick is the master of the keyboards. Masterful at his craft and dramatic in his interpretations of musical styles of what it was like centuries ago. I still prefer the JOURNEY album but still like listening to this as well.
5,still majikal in it's beauty,"I was 8 the first time I haerd this album, and yet it stirrs in me endless childhood weekends, my parents gaming, and my friends and I in the back yard playing out the adventures we heard from our parents music from the window. many times I was merlin, others I was galahad. but never was I truly wonered as to when I played arthur. this isn't just a music from a time of the past, this music will still be here long efter me and mine have passed from this world. I reccommend it to anyone who has a twinkle of a child left in their hearts, pick up the wooden swords and ride off into the imaginary battles once again."
2,Not Good,"As a long time Rick Wakeman fan it always puzzled me why King Arthur was missing from my collection, now I know why. Compared to the 'Journey' album this is a disappointment, the vocals are muddy and there is no story being told, just a collection of Wakeman tracks with an orchestral backing. I will probably hold on to the CD for a while just in case it grows on me but don't be surprised if this album ends up in a second hand store."
2,boring boring boring to death,"Six Wives is so much better than this one.I bought this one and Yes's Fragile at the same time. No comparison. Fragile is much more mature, elaborate, complicated, masterpiece.At some point I was so annoyed by the keyboard sound that I turned of the cd. As I am writting this review I am listening to the 6th Track ""Sir Galahad"", and its really really bad. If I could have my money back I would return it in an instance."
1,Disappointing,I kept looking for a story line to match the music much like Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds.
1,TMALOKAAHNOTRT???,"'Bombast!' the famous pianist Richard Wakeman cried out. 'I put out a great album with orchestra and choir on it, and they call it bombast!'The record people nodded.'But I'll get 'em', Wakeman continued grimly. 'Here comes another one. With even more bombast on it. They want bombast, bombast is what they'll get!'The record people nodded.'I'll call it Bombast', Wakeman concluded triumphantically.The record people nodded.And so it came out. It was called The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table. Well, the record people said, we can shorten it to TMALOKAAHKOTRT. But, they all agreed, that didn't mean much. Certainly not more than the music."
3,Not the best Wakeman,Wakeman is one of my favorite performers and this album shows why. He succeeds or fails dramatically. The story is well concieved but inconsistently presented. Vocals are often over dramatized and recall a poor light opera. This is consistent with many other choral forays scored by Wakeman. His playing is flawless but not as inspired as other formats.Keep at it Rick. You're the best but you have done better and will do better again.
3,Kindle DownLoad,"While I was happy to have access to this work on my kindle, I found that its format and the number of typographical errors was distracting."
2,"Too harsh on the teeth, oversized head","I used to use the oral b toothbrushes and then decided to venture out and try others. After reading the reviews on Amazon, decided to give the Spinbrush Pro a spin. After 3 weeks, I am retiring the Spinbrush and returning to Oral B.The head of the brush is much larger than the head of the oral b brushes. The smaller head is much easier to use and reaches the various crevices that a normal brush and the spinbrush can not get to.The spinbrush is also very harsh on the tooth enamel - much more so than the oral b models. The powerful motor - a gas guzzler by all accounts - is too powerful for me. It's also a little too noisy.If you really want to get this one instead of the oral b, would suggest giving the soft bristles version a whirl instead - the softer bristles might be a little less abrasive on the enamel than this is.But the price and the fact that it does do its basic job - cleaning teeth - keeps me from giving it a 1."
3,"Okay, Not His Finest","Now understand first: I don't mind long books. Executive Orders was over 350 pages longer, and I gave it 5 stars. Now let me proceed. This book was too long. It could have easily been 300 pages shorter with only minimal detractions to the story. Its story is rather farfetched, and many of the characters aren't developed very well. This falls short of its predacessor in the Ryan series, The Sum of all Fears, and its sucessor, Executive Orders. At least the climax is good."
4,Different,"I've read several of Clancy's Op-Center books. I've read the Hunt or Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear-and-Present-Danger.This was definately different. At times, it seemed as though Clancy wasn't doing the writing.Good book though... Not the ending I expected though..."
2,"Very well written, but plot too weak.","DoH is - as all TC books - a long and very well written read. There is lots of surprising twists and turns, but in the end it's up to a small group of all-american superheros in their amazing machines, to save the USA again. This lack of credibility - together with too many one-dimensional characters - makes it a bit of a disappointment as a whole. However, the first half makes it worth the time and effort."
3,"Entertaining, but lacking","This book was entertaining and suspensful. It was also extremely long and hard to believe, and it left the reactions of the U.N. It would have been better if Clancy had cut out some of the long, drawn out beginning and given a better description of what really would have happened in this situation. Granted, it does take a long time to tell a story like this well, but 990 pages?"
4,beautiful war orchestra,"Beautiful war orchestra. (1) deception with CNN covered 2 US carier are damaged, (2) attack helicopter flies just above railroad then enemy AEW can't differentiate it is train or helicopter, (3) anti AEW maneuver (like Cobra - Pugachev) to defeat enemy AEW.The downside is not mentioned about Okinawa, USMC has a regiment there, but in this book it is not participated."
4,"Not his best ,but still a entertaining book.","it was a entertaining book with interesting battle sequences, but it was a little too long."
2,"Glorified characters, Japanese cliché's, ridiculous ending.","Yeah, as if this could really happen. Clancy's crash course in economics misses its target completely, boring the reader with a completely unbelievable plot concerning the destruction of global economics. The black and white cardboard characters Clancy depicts here are next to ridiculous. Only his fluent narrative drive keeps the book going. He should do some more investigation on the real world than on technical matters, though. Japanese are not so dumb as we are let to believe from this book (I work for a Japanese company and speak from my experience). It reminded me a lot of those old WW2 pictures where good old GI Joe easily butchers Heinz because of his supposed intellectual superiority. Clancy can do much, much better."
2,Ridiculous Ending Mars Mediocre Book,Pretty interesting book that is fast paced. But what an unbelieveable ending. Ruined the whole thing. Good Grief! For Tom Clancy fans only.
2,WORDS FROM A FORMER CLANCY FAN:,"If it wasn't for the kamikazee thing in the end, I would have never picked up another Clancy book. Of course I want to find out what happens to Ryan in ""Executive Orders."" But I would have been more entertained reading a pile of lease agreements than 95% of Debt of Honor"
3,And Some Say This Is Clancy's Best?!?,"This book reminds me of the joke about asking a guy what time it is and by the time he gets finished telling you the history of timekeeping and the intricate evolution of timekeeping devices you've forgetten where it was you were going. Ponderous, disjointed, confusing, and sloooooow during the first half of the book. It seems as if Clancy spent so much time on the first half of the book plotting (or should I say plodding) it all out that he finally got fed up and decided to just hurry up and get it over with in the last half. In order to get through it, you'll just have to suppress the urge to say ""Oh come on..."" as he helps the good guys win until the very end which was just really unbelievable."
4,Great if you can suspend your disbelief,"OK, so the whole Japan/US war thing is not very believable, but it is fiction after all. If you can get past that, then this is an engrossing book."
4,My husband loves Tom Clancy,good book. My husband loves the Jack Ryan stories and he drives alot so this was exactly what he wanted and needed.
4,Close to Perfect!,"I just finished Debt of Honor last night and Ill just say it was fanstastic. Dont expect to read the book fast and the fast pace action doesnt come until about 600 or 700 pages into the book. Its interesting enough to keep you in it though, and the last 10 pages are the best of any Clancy book I have read. I cannot give Clancy's book 5 stars though because, unfortanetly he uses foul language not justwith principle characters but even with respectable buissnesmen which is absurd to say the least. He could have put Clark and Chavez in more as those were some of the coolest parts. Also the rather slow start takes away from it. But altogether a great book."
1,please!,"hello! is anyone awake after reading this book! i read hunt for red october and got hooked, this is a disgrace for clancy! it you like to write 700 pages of college notes with an example plot twisted into it-go ahead read it! its funny that this is coming from a die-hard tom clancy fan! he has been getting better with his characterization, i especially like clark and chavez, but jack ryan must go . . . you cant use the same character in each one of your books! but, do read all his other books!"
3,Debt of Honor,"The other reviews tell you what you want to know so I won't elaborate on that. Note that some of the minor relationships are more interesting if you've read ""Without Remorse"" first. Great book for John Clark fans."
4,Among the best!!,"I finsihed reading this book 2 weeks ago, and I was amazed by the ending! Clancy takes the unthinkable, and takes us for a ride!The battles with Japan were great, and even the financial stuff was intresting.Though it was slow to start, once it got going, it didn't stop!"
3,Good book but eprice is way too high,"As with some other writers, sometimes the subject gets a little far fetched, but Clancy does his usual great job of making you feel for the characters. This a another of his books that I will re-read, but I refuse to pay $10 for the e version when it only costs a couple dollars for the printed version."
2,Another reason why Clancy needs a better editor!,"While I find Tom Clancy's books to be interesting, I really think that they would benefit by having about 2-300 pages edited out of them. Unfortunately, Debt of Honor is another case of Clancy confusing quantity with quality. Also, I think it's about time that Clancy realizes that, for his books to be truly gripping, he must have something more than cardboard cut-outs for characters. In Hunt for Red October, Jack Ryan started out as a believable, although accomplished hero. Somewhere along the way to Debt of Honor, he's evolved (or devolved) into something approaching a cartoon character, one who's always saving the world."
4,Great reading,"Not quite as good as Hunt for Red October, but geeod reading, leads directly into the next book which I liked."
3,Dismayed at the typo/conversion errors in Kindle versions,"I have downloaded and read three of the Jack Ryan novels by Tom Clancy on my Kindle; I have been dismayed at the number of what appears to be conversion errors (words butted together where an apparent hyphen would be, many ""e"" characters show as ""c"", and others) books are really good, I wish someone would create a chronological (storywise) of the series..."
5,Remote Control Terminator,"I loved to read as I was growing up and have limited a lotof my recent reading to short stories. I was orderinganother book from Amazon and ran across DOH. As soon as Ireceived the book in the mail I sat down and began to readand read and read... The story was like reading today'snewspapers, it tied in current events and themes to thepoint that I had to stop and remind myself that this wasfiction. I can't wait to get my copy of Executive Ordersto see how Mr. Ryan takes on the next challenge!"
4,WWII all over again,"Clancy revisits the attack on Pearl Harbor with a war between Japan and the U.S. which started due to faulty automobile parts and poorly executed trade negotiations. Using modern technology and strategy, the American military once again defeats the aggressive Japanese. The book ends with a jet-liner crashing into the Capitol building decimating congress and leaving the country leaderless. Ryan finds himself the almost sworn in Vice-President of a nation in the midst of a crisis and on the brink of catastrophe."
4,Clancy gets better each time he picks up his pen,"Maybe Clancy should be running the world. He puts scenariostogether like there's no tomorrow (though maybe he knowssomething the rest of us don't).So why doesn't he get a better book-binder. Debt of Honourfell to pieces after reading a few pages. So now my friendscan't borrow it. Oh, I get it. It's called clevermarketing.Anyway Tommy babe (if you ever read this). How about younext turn your talents to something truly international.Australia (my country) could do with some world exposure.Perhaps we could be the next bad guys. And with the Sydney2000 Olympics around the corner ..."
2,"Too long, too contrived","Dear lord - 400 pages to get to anything of substance/action? And talk about a string of convenient coincidences. Finally, Clancy's economic analysis is seriously flawed - if Japan's economy truly gets hammered the way he suggests by the TRA, then the last thing that they would be able to do is dump Treasuries, especially given their large (and unmentioned) stake in the US equities market."
4,Not a bad book,"As a soldier curently in Iraq, I've found more time to read. After reading this book i was a little disapponted that the action was so short. I did enjoy the book though. I was quite impressed by the way Tom Clancy goes into such detail describing just about everything. I could actually imagine being John Clark/Kelly or Ding Chavez, or any of the others. The book ends in a clif-hanger, making me want to pick up the next book and continue the story."
2,A very slow start,"This book really starts very slow, explaining all sorts of things. I quit reading after about 200 pages."
5,Clancy shines as usual,"I found Debt of Honor like his other books. Awesome. I have never disliked any of his books and have quite truthfully loved them all. Right now I am reading both Executive Orders and Rainbow Six and I am completely engrossed in both, I don't know which one to pick up."
3,"Not Clancy at his best, but still worth a read.","Having spent a lot of time in Japan both as a student and otherwise, I have to say the main flaw of this book is how Clancy treats the Japanese. While this book is clearly a work of fiction, Clany's attempt to find a vilian in the Japanese government and society is totaly not grounded in reality. I liked the economic aspect of the book, though. All and all a good read but Clancy needs to spend some more time in Japan and get rid of his WWII bases sterotypes of the Japanese."
3,"clancy's best are shorter, bolder, and more convincing","Too dang long, convoluted, and outlandish. But that's what we like best about Mr. Clancy, no? While I was enthralled by his detailing of unique new weaponry, political clout-at-work, and the requisite gusto of his subplots' premises, I found this story as a whole much harder to embrace than, say, Clear and Present Danger. The conclusion was certainly a send-off to end all send-offs, but you could see it coming all the way from Vancouver (read and you'll know what I mean). I also didn't enjoy or get to know the plot-advancing characters as much as I normally do in his works; some were almost as cardboard as Grisham's denizens of ""The Firm.""But I'm still going to read Executive Orders. That man has me too well hooked to wriggle off now"
3,Half way and finally getting interested,"I'm 500 pages into the book right now and it's finally starting to get interesting. The first 3 or 400 pages were like attending an economics seminar, very boring! I like Clancy's books for the military aspect, I almost quit reading about 5 times, but perseverence is finally paying off. In the book the United States and Russia rid both of their nuclear arsenals completley, I found that very hard to believe. I've come to expect that Clancy's books have numerous sub-plots and it usually takes 200 pages to get started, but he really overkilled the details in this book."
3,For die-hard Clancy fans,"I've skipped around the Jack Ryan series of Clancy books -- skipping one or two, reading them out of order, etc. Debt of Honor was typical Clancy -- very heavy on the logistics and technical details of modern political and military conflict, light on character development. I guess there may be men like ""Saint Jack"" Ryan in political life, but sometimes you just want him to kick his dog or cuss someone out. Some may enjoy the financial details of this book, but I found myself skipping through large chunks of this one. The build up to the military conflict -- the real meat and gift of Clancy's writing -- seemed interminable. I just kept waiting for *something* to *happen.* I'll probably read Executive Decision just to find out what crisis Jack lands in as president of the US of A, but in the meantime, I hope Clancy comes out with another entry to the Op Center series of books"
5,4 & 1/2 stars would be more accurate,"This is one of Tom Clancy's best novels, although unless you have an understanding of the stock market, the plot will serve to confuse you. But true to Clancy form, this only accounts for one of many plots in this suspense thriller.As the National Security Advisor, Jack Ryan's advice to the president is essential as America is attacked by a hotile foreign country on several fronts. America's economy takes a plunge after a stock market shutdown, foreign interests have purchased and occupied American soil, and our navy is crippled.Meanwhile CIA operative John Clark and Ding Chavez are sent into the enemy country to conduct covert operations.The powerful ending of this book should have you eager to read the sequel, ""Executive Orders""."
2,I'm really disappointed Tom,"Clancy's plot never really worked out. While the ending was something different, the ability to solve the crisis with Japan was completely unoriginal. Another problem; the book is WAY TOO LONG!!!!. for 990 pages, I expected more. The book could've been written in a lot fewer pages and a lot more trees would still be alive. This book brings to mind another Japanese conflict: the Russo-Japanese war. Russia looked all too powerful when taking on the Japaese. However, just like Clancy's book, the got beaten badly and only saved face due to a few twists in negotiations from the President of the United States"
4,"Good story but Tom, Please cut down on the paper !!","The seventh book of Clancy's that I have read and this one seems to drag on through the middle four hundred pages where Tom feels the need to explain the entire workings of the world financial markets. He takes too long to set up his plots and subplots even though I enjoyed the book. The last two hundred pages wizz by as the action heats up and the battles rage in the Pacific and at home. The ending is a little far fetched but exciting and I hope Tom can limit his stories to five hundred pages. I hope Tom can switch subjects and write another ""Red Storm Rising"" type novel, without Jack Ryan, branching into a different area. Still his best is ""Patriot Games"". Message to the movie studios: NEVER ravage another Clancy book like you did to ""Clear and Present Danger"" the movie departs from the book after two minutes and never comes close to the book again!!"
4,"Exciting, believable",Another one of Tom Clancy's action-packed novels. Could war really break out between the US and Japan? It sounds credible. But the ending will really surprise you.
3,"Slow to start, good last 150 pages, except the ending.","I read ""Hunt for Red October"" a long time ago, then drifted away from Tom Clancy books. I picked this book up for a cruise I was going on. I feel it was too long, and he spent way too much time explaining the intricacies of Wall Street. I am not much for finance, but like military action. Towards the end of the book, when we start to counter-attack, the action picks up and the book becomes hard to put down. I was a little disappointed at the ending though, especially if it were that easy to do something like that (I will not give away what the ending is in case you have not read it yet)."
2,Too much confusing data - not enough plot and story line,"Clancy needlessly wastes words and pages explaining details that are far too intricate to be truly necessary to advance the story line. He's still a great writer, but this material should be in a technical manual not a work of fiction."
2,What the..???,"OK the book started good, I was starting to get into the story until the part when the Japanese attack the 2 carriers...from that point on I was like ""you got to be kidding me!!"" That is like the most stupid and dumbest operation I have ever read, come on the fire a few ASW torpedoes at two aircraft carriers and call it a day? Victory we put a couple of small holes on those two ships...now the Americans will respect us!! It was just ridiculous, from then on it just went downhill for me...sorry but I think that this book is plain stupid.Well the attack on Wall Street was cool...way too much babble but cool."
2,BOOOOOORING,I had never read a tom clancy book until I read this. From the beggining this book was horrible. I stopped after 70 pages. I thought I was reading non-fiction. I think Clancy might have gone overboard with the details on this book. I dont even know what the story is about. Maybe it's just me but unless you want to be board to death dont read this book.
2,Too lengthy...,"Just like the other Clancy's books, this book is too lengthy. Could Clancy consider cutting his books a bit? I am not talking about the technical stuff. I am talking about getting rid the scenes which have no use and serve no purpose. The scenes are too disconnected. Each scene is too short. Sometimes just two small paragraphs. You just can't get into it. Why doesn't Clancy put Jack Ryan in the middle and make everything go around him more?"
4,Good little book,"I enjoyed the stories. They were moving and thoughtful with protagonists making difficult choices. It's well worth reading and Aqueduct shipped the book quickly. I wish the author would write another novel, BTW. Hint hint."
5,"Every day in your indigo eyes, I'll watch the sunset but I don't see it rise...","that is the line that is MISSING on the shorter 3 min single version of Jackie Blue that is mostly played on the radio, why cut it in the 1st place, as the LP cuts is only a 4:10 in legnth.This A&M; lp has the full version in all it's gloryBut this album so much more than just Jackie and her exploits, the whole LP is a stellar spin, yes I said LP, as I have an orginal pressing from the 70sfun fact, Jackie Blue is sung by their drummer, Larry Lee."
5,One of OMD's Best Albums,If you are an Ozark Mountain Daredevils fan this CD is a MUST for your collection. I first purchased this album as a cassette and wore the first one out and had to purchase a second one. Now that it is out on CD I can enjoy it again and again. OMD is one great Missouri country rock band!!!
3,"Good record, not-so-good mix?","I wasn't much familiar with the Daredevils, but my wife had very fond memories of this album, so I was happy to pick it up on Amazon. Several tunes I recalled from radio play back in the day (aside from the omnipresent Jackie Blue), but with one difference - the vocals on some tunes seem buried in the mix. It's especially noticeable on the rockin' Look Away, where the predominant feature is the rhythm section. Maybe it's my aging ears - has anyone else noticed this?"
5,As desired and expected,"The part fit my vehicle, thanks to Amazon's ""garage"" setup. It arrived as desired and expected. I installed it as desired and expected. I paid a reasonable price for the starter."
5,A must for melodic guitar fans.,I second everything the previous reviewer said. I would also highly recommend seeing Neil live if you get the chance. He is a very good showman.
3,"Danco 88270 360-Degree Swivel Aerator and Sprayer, Plastic, Chrome/White","Well i got tired of buying the look a like one with great flow power from the local dollar store and changing it once a month, so i bought this one to give it a try. One problem was 2.0 gallons per minute. Terrible, so i took out my drill and enlarged the opening from more flow. Now it has good Force for the kitchen Dishes and has been working great so far for months so far. Probably flowing 3.0-4.0 or better."
3,Nice... for six months,"I got this in March, and it was great. It's still basically functional, but by the end of September, it suddenly started ""leaking"" from between the two upper white ""gears"". I use leaking in quotation marks because it wasn't a drip kind of leak. It's a kind of leak where when I turn on the water, a thin yet powerful jet of water often sprays a significant distance outwards in an unpredictable direction; onto the counter, or the wall behind the faucet, or on me. I wouldn't want to go back to not having one of these attachments now that I've experienced their usefulness, but when I get a replacement (in the very near future) it will be a different brand, which will hopefully last at least a year before developing problems. The kind that comes with a built-in on/off switch will probably be my next one."
4,took me a while to figure out the double threading,"My faucets have male connectors, so following the instructions of using both washers it came with did not work. Using only the thin washer I was finally able to connect it to my faucet."
4,Showed up on time and installed easily.,"I got this to replace a Brita faucet head we no longer use because the new fridge has a filter. The old Brita came off by hand and this installed easily by hand tightening. It came with two rubber washers and said to use both during installation, by my faucet only accommadated one. Working fine. It seems a little light weight but is performing as expected."
2,"Plastic, not metal",Item is described as 'all metal'. It is not. ...same plastic nozzle you can get for half the price elsewhere.
3,Fitting is not designed right,"Because the threaded section is so short it wouldn't attach to my utility sink. I finally got it on by buying an adapter at Home Depot. It works fine once I got it attached. It might attach successfully to a kitchen sink faucet, but it would look pretty tacky in the kitchen."
2,Too tall for my sink!,"This aerator/sprayer was the right price and I do like the spray control, but it caused my sink faucet to be so low that I couldn't fit tall things underneath it - like the water tank for the coffee maker and basic half gallon pitchers. That might just be an issue with my own sink, but it was inconvenient enough that I ended up replacing this with a basic aerator after a few weeks."
3,Repetitive,"I've read and enjoyed most of Trollope's novels, but Marion Fay is not one of my favorites. There's just not enough story to sustain the book's length. Right now, I'm reading the section where Roden has discovered his father's identity. Trollope keeps going over and over this material from several characters' points of view. It adds nothing to the story."
3,Of little interest,"Maybe it is just me, but I couldn't seem to get interested in this book. Perhaps if I had been more persistent and less preoccupied with other matters, I would have been able to get into this read. That has happened before with other books I have read."
5,New Wave/Pop/Punk/Reggae Styles Converge,"I picked up this remastered CD a few years ago, having last heard it on a crappy tape-of-a-tape cassette in the early 80s. I remember liking it at the time but listening to it as an adult gave me a new appreciation. The production is crisp and straightforward in a way that musicians of lesser talent could not pull off. My first thought upon rehearing this CD was ""They were a really tight band."" The reggae/blues fused ""Geraldine and John"" is very cool. I like almost all the songs on this recording, for various reasons. Definitely worth a listen."
5,An All-Time Favorite!!!,This c.d. is great for when you are traveling! It is upbeat and keeps you singing along the whole time. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites!!!
5,No sophomore slump in music or remastering,"This album came out 9 months after Joe's debut with ""Look Sharp!"" It covers the same basic musical territory, but with perhaps an even better collection of songs. They are both way, way up on my list of all-time favorites.As with Look Sharp!, this is everything you could ask for in a CD remaster: dramatically improved sound, a killer live version of a Chuck Berry song as a bonus track, expanded album art, full lyrics, new liner notes, and a mid-range price..."
5,Rivas are the best,Love the Rivas. Bought at $10 less than anywhere else I could find. Fast delivery and shoes arrived perfectly.
5,"Light, comfortable, stylish, reasonably durable","I have been wearing Florsheim Rivas for about 20 years (ever since I became unable to find the similar French Shriner model). I think they have a timeless, never-out-of-fashion elegance. More important, they are very comfortable. The all-leather upper is soft and pliable, and the plastic sole is soft, well cushioned, and noiseless when walking on hard floors. These shoes hold up pretty well; I wear mine about once a week and a pair lasts for 3 to 4 years or even more. The only problem is they are a bit expensive; since my last purchase, I have found similar shoes (including the long-lost French Shriners!) in the $60 to $70 range."
1,huge dissapointment,"Shoes seemed comfortable so I have purchased to wear them in the office. The quality was so shoddy - I will never purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes.I have worn them only in a car driving to work and in the office. Still, in 2-3 days the spray-on laquer started to peel of from soles. After 3 weeks or so sole of one shoe desintegrated, cracked. Just imagine, wearing those shoes in the street - would they even last several hours?Could be just one ""unlucky"" pair..."
5,"best, most comfortable, dress shoe for men",I've worn these for years now and they remain the most comfortable dress shoe for the office that I have ever found.
3,Regular,"Nice look as anny Florsheim , but the isolate coushon is really poor for this quallity shoes. I was looking for Shoes to ware at least 3 times a week but this are to hard ."
5,Excellent Fit,Excellent shoes and fit very well. I recommend it. I have been using these kind of shoes for many years and always it fits excellently from day one of its use.
4,Soles too thin,"The shoes look good and fit well (perhaps just a little narrow). The thing that bothers me is that I can feel every little pebble through the soles. Most shoes I've owned, you can step on pebbles and you can't feel them very much. These shoes make me feel like the ""Princess and the Pea""."
3,Tight fit,"Got a size bigger and wider but they were tight, returned them and have yet to hear whether I got credit for shoes and shipping costs to return them."
1,Return,We returned this toy the next day. The water sprays straight up and doesn't really even spray the children. The bar falls off and is more of a pain since you have to put it back on again and again. I wouldn't recommend this at all!!
3,Pretty cool,"This toy is fun, but it is not educational at ALL.On the bright side it is quite durable.For example, once my little sister (6 years old) Swung it on to the ground and I thought it had broke.But you know what, it did not break at all. Overall it is a pretty cool toy and I would encourage you to buy it."
1,Foreign policy failure,"The State Department (i.e. the Republican Party, as the Bush Regime unifies Party & Government just as the Communists did in the old Soviet Union) dispatched Alan Keyes to Illinois under the impression that it was a foreign country. They hoped he would take it over. But he was stymied and so thoroughly neutralized that Illinois did not even bother to take him to the border. Now he begs quarters at the airport and waits for the United States Government (i.e. the Republican Party) to rescue him. But Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (father of the daughter that Keyes likes to yell about) have something in mind for the somewhat brave Mr. Keyes: by this time next year they hope that he will be Senator from Iran."
3,Somewhat good PPV,Matt Hardy vs JBL 5/10I wasn't expecting anything out of this match and I'm sure glad I didn't...JBL wins.Mexicools vs MNM 7/10Pretty good match...MNM wins.Booker T vs Chris Benoit 9/10I thought this was the best match in their feud because Chris Benoit WINS.Bobby Lashley vs William Regal & Paul Burchill 6/10WWE needs to give Burchill a championship fast because he is REALLY talented(standing shooting star press!) Lashley winsJuvi vs Kid Kash 6/10ok match with the kid winning the small one.Batista and Rey Rey vs Kane and Big Show 8.5/10Batista's injury couldn't let this match be match of the nightKane and Big Show winUndertaker vs Randy Orton 10/10Not the best hell in the cell(my favorite is Vengeance 05) but a good match anyway. Taker wins.
2,ARMAGEDDON SUCKS AGAIN,"This just shows how bad smackdown really is. Every ppv is sad and its like watching a normal smackdown show. Maybe Kurt Angle can change smackdown for the better. Anyways I did buy the dvd cause i am a wwe collector but i probally wont watch it again. One good thing is that Walmart is selling the dvd in a 2 disc exclusive. The second disc is armageddon 2003, so it was worth the 15 dollars. You can see how raw is ten times better at ppv shows, just watch new years revolution."
4,A Decent PPV!,"MATCH 1: JBL Vs Matt Hardy - 5/10Basically just JBL beating up Matt Hardy.MATCH 2: MNM Vs Psicosis + Super Crazy - 8/10High flying matchup with some technical wrestling, great match.MATCH 3: FOURTH MATCH IN THE BEST OF SEVEN SERIES FOR THE US TITLE - 9/10Best match in the series so far.MATCH 4: Bobby Lashley Vs William Regal + Paul Birchell - 5/10A short squash match.MATCH 5: CRUSIERWEIGHT TITLE - Juventude Guerrera VS Kid Kash - 7/10The crowd ruined this match, even though it had some great moves.MATCH 6: Batista + Rey Mysterio Vs The Big Show + Kane - 7/10Decent match.MATCH 7: HELL IN A CELL MATCH - Randy Orton Vs The Undertaker - 8/10Very brutal and bloody match although there were no big spots.Overall Event Rating - 7/10"
1,Great Soap Opera! What? You Say This Was a Wrestling PPV?,"I coulda sworn I was watching General Hospital. I was shocked to see this was WWE's Armageddon ppv as I looked at the title. I'm sorry, but there was one good match on this whole card. Most of the card was thrown together with no stories, and Tim White committing suicide was completely dtupid and idiotic. Taker and Orton was the only good match, but for a Hell in a Cell it was probably one of the worst Cell matches in history. I am shocked to see that some people actually enjoyed this ppv. I guess wrestling fans theese days only like storylines and not matches. Here's a suggestion, if you like storylines more then wrestling, watch a soap!!! End of story."
3,WWE Armageddon 2005,This event is not so great. Not so great matches except Raw v Smackdown tag team match and the Hell In A Cell match [The Undertaker v Randy Orton]. It is a waste of money buying this DVD.
4,what it do / ICE MAN PAUL WAL;L,"man this was an average ppvi like the cruiserwieght matchup and the hell in dthe cellplus this ppv gets help from batista and rey vs kane and b.sand mnm vs mexicoolsmatt hardy vs jblbad opener but great enterances that got me pumpedjbl wins .and you wanna know why.because h is a wrassailin god!!!!!!!!!!!! 8/10MEXICOWS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ VS MNMMAN THIS WAS A GREAT FAAT PACED MATCHMNM WISN AFTER SNAPSHOT 8/10I DONT FEEL LIKE REVIEWING BT I WILLCRUSERWIEGHT MATCHAHHHHAHHHHHHHHHHH HHAAAAAAAAAA THE FANS WERE BOOING THIS MATCFHAND I WAS LAUGHING SO MUCH. HOW THEY EVEN SAID END THI MATCH.THAT WAS FUNNY AS HELL. KID KASH WAS SO EMBARRESED. I WAS LAUGHING]2/10 BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HELL IN A CELL.TAKER WINS A SO,SO MATCH"
1,TNA IS BETTER AT PPVS PERIOD,"WWE is lacking now-boost up Vince or you and WWE are outda window.i used to like WWE when it was desent but its in hell right now.TNA is better at the moment so i just want to chant:TNA,TNA,TNA,TNA,TNA=YAY!!!!!!!!!WWE,WWE,WWE,WWE=BOOEEEEEEE.IT SUX!"
1,You've Got to Be Kidding Me,"C'mon. Seriously, if people think this is a good ppv, then I'm disgusted of what's coming of wrestling fans theese days. Hell in a Cell was good, but one good match dosent make ppvs. Tim White killing himself was retarded and WWE creative team outta be fired."
5,birthday gift,"I ordered this book as a birthday request for my son. Although I won't be reading the book myself, he said it was exactly the one he wanted."
5,Very good introduction!,"Clear and concise, done with not one wit of 'speaking down' to you, and the explanations are straightforward. The material is introduced a piece at a time, and with reasonable review questions that are surprisingly thorough.I would suggest it to anyone who wants a good reference to JavaScript as well. Buy it you won't be disappointed."
2,Missing errata and download files,"I started to use this book and came across a few errors. These resulted in errors in the output. I went to the website to find the errata for the book but there is no errata as promised.Also, the book states that the scripts can be downloaded from the website. I could not find them.I think anyone wishing to buy the book check out for errata, if they can find them, on the website. I didn't and I probably would not have bought the book if I had known there was no support from the publisher.I have always had a bad experience with Mc Graw Hill."
5,Passed the Sturdiness Test,"I was looking for a quality flatware set for my daughter and was amazed ah how difficult of a task it was. My requirement was very basic - the flatware had to be sturdy, meaning no wabbly forks and knives that bend out of shape at the first touch. I looked literally at dozens of designs. I went to Macy's and looked at their entire flatware section - one pattern at a time. This design was the sturdiest of them all. I also liked the sleek minimalistic 'art deco' style - timeless and modern at the same time. I hope that the quality will match the sturdiness and style."
3,I would ask for more...,"from Henckels...But then, the price tells you - this product is not made in Germany.They don't feel that light, but they are not substantial enough to give that upscale look to your setting. Also these neat, simple, slim handles are not the most comfortable to hold. Well, this set certainly looks sleek, especially in this price range."
3,I would ask for more...,"from Henckels...They don't feel that light, but they are not substantial enough to give that upscale look to your setting. Also these neat, simple, slim handles are not the most comfortable to hold. Well, this set certainly looks sleek, especially in this price range (yes, you can guess where they are made)."
2,This is stainless????,The flatware has a very nice look and weight to it. Everyone compliments us on our silverware until they see the knives. Every knife in the set began to rust so we sent them back to Henckels for replacements (we had to pay the shipping). Now the replacements are beginning to rust as well. For this reason I wouldn't recommend this set to my friends.
1,They call this stainless?!?!?!,"This is a pathetic attemp at stainless steel!! Each and every knife has large rust spots on it. I have to now spend my money to send it back to Henckels to get them replaced,,,then keep my fingers crossed that its dosn't happen again. Odd it's only the the knives, another reviewer had the same problem."
4,"nice, but one dishwasher problem...","We bought this set a couple of months ago and are still loving the look and weight-in-hand of the Opus set. The only problem, which I had not forseen before purchasing, is that they have to be placed ""heads down"" in the dishwasher basket due to the slim handle. I would normally alternate ""heads up"" and ""heads down"" in the dishwasher to avoid the items from nesting and not coming out clean, and so my diswashing scheme is a little less efficient than before. We do like this set enough to keep rather than return, but I just thought this might be a useful tidbit for someone thinking about purchasing. Our dishwasher is a common Kenmore model."
3,great look - bad stainless,"i have owned my Henckels set for over 4 years. almost immediately they looked worn and used after washing. hand or machine, no difference. nothing would remove these somewhat permanent looking water sploches but aggressive elbow grease. eventually i just ignored this...but about a year later the knives started to look like they were left in the road and run over. i continued to use the set without the original knives. now everything looks so rotten and rusty that it is time to find something better made. incidentally, mine are stamped JAPAN, not china. anyway...i do not feel they are of great long term value. they are definitely better suited for occasional use. i also encountered similar rust/water damage with the 'everedge' steak knives. strange that it is almost immediate with the lower cost knives."
5,"Functional, modern children's table and chairs","We ordered this set for a new playroom in our home. We wanted a table and chair set that was both functional and contemporary. We loved this Offi set the minute we saw it on line. It is a perfect size for children up to five years old and we love that it is easy to clean, safe for children because it is foam, and able to withstand art projects, building toys and an occasional chair being knocked over. We ordered the red/orange set, but it is not a true red, more of a cherry red. We highly recommend it."
3,Delonghi MG15TSRB,"This item was fairly priced and shipped on date promised. However, it was inadequately packed for transhipment (the lightweight carton it arrived in was the same you'd find on your department store shelf) and the item arrived with dents, bent fins, and chipped paint. There was no operating manual with the item, and none available online. Inasmuch as the item is in operating condition, and it's just too much of a hassle to return it, no damage claim will be made."
2,great unit bad handling and bad fact. refurb.,"i bought 3 of these units for 125.00 total shipped with the 25 off coupon, great deal as these unit at my local home depot sell for around 100 bucks. but the problem is that they came and two were dented and the other scratched, neither the dents or the scratch affected how they worked first 2 operated great but the last one, the one with the scratch would not heat up, so i decided to open the unit and found 2 wires were not connected, easy fix, i just opened one that work and connected the wires accordingly. i am certified in electrical house wiring and electric motor repair, so this was no problem for me but others should be careful. other than that man these unit crank out the heat, i have a one story 3 bedroom ranch and these will keep my gas bill low this winter...."
4,Good Value for a Heater,"I first would like to agree with what other reviewers have said. That is, these items are really scratch-and-dent discounts as opposed to factory reconditioned. I purchased two of these heaters and both came in tact, but in no other shipping materials than the stock packaging. However, it is my assumption that the minor-to-moderate damage was done prior to it being shipped to me. One of the two had the timer unit dislodged, but two minutes and a couple of screws later it was back in place.That being said, these heaters seem to a great job. One heater was able to raise a 9'x12' room (with three exterior walls) by about 10 within about 90 minutes on the low setting. If you truly want a heater that you will enjoy looking at, do not buy these. However, if you really just need a good deal on a heater that has a timer, I recommend them."
3,"Works good, but banged up.","I ordered 3 and the guy I work with ordered 3. All six had dents in them, but all work okay. Don't order if new is what you want. However, they do function. I don't write many reviews, but disappointed with Amazon not disclosing the dents."
3,Wow Electric Shock and Blown Circuits! But it works now.,"I received my heater today, unwrapped it, and plugged it in. It was SHOCKING! Literally, the quick connects on the inside of the timer were placed incorrectly causing an immediate short directly to the entire metal body of the unit. With a screwdriver and a quick change around the wiring, it now works great.Since I know a bit about wiring, it was no huge deal to fix it. For anyone not wishing to be electricuted (which is the least terrible thing that could happen with this type of retarded error.), I would not recommend someone with limited or no knowledge of fixing things to purchase one.Basically, ""handypersons delight"", otherwise, DO NOT BOTHER.I hope DeLonghi doesn't kill someone or find themselves being sued for damages with the type of errors they seem to be making on their refurbs. Their regular products are great!"
2,Not like it was advertised.,"Though I knew that it was factory reconditioned, it was more like an used one. I was quite disappointed when it came in with a lot of scratches on both sides and on the top. It definitely couldn't be caused by transportation as the top was cover with a sponge. It also was dented in the front. The power light for Medium level worked only once then it was flown off. So you can't tell if it is working or not until you feel the heat coming out from it. I wanted to ask for an exchange but I couldn't find how to do so in the Amazon's website there is only return option but I want to keep it, just want to change to another one which I hope could be in a better condition."
2,Bad history,"I have an older set of 900mAH Powerex batteries - 8 of about 80 rechargeables I own. I just got a BC1000 battery analyzer and went through all of mine. All 8 Powerex were bad - averaging about 620mAh after just a year of use. Enloops were all still at 95-110% of their rated strength. You shouldn't be paying more than $2.50 each for a AAA, and that's for the newer low discharge chemistry, which I don't think these are."
2,"Cheap, never held a good charge","Bought these for a small Chinese MP3 player I found in a parking lot, and thought ""What the heck, I'll get some rechargeable AAA batt's and make it my gym rig."" From the moment I used them, they had little juice. After a recharge, they had little juice. In fact, my battery power indicator on the MP3 player only showed one notch (out of three possible) every time I used them, and they died very quickly. I thought that maybe it was just the cheap MP3 player, so I went and bought the cheapest, crummiest alkaline batteries I could fine, and they held a charge WAY longer than these. I gave them two stars because at least I could recharge them and reuse them, even if they only lasted for a few hours."
5,Take Control,"A fast and fascinating read, Daniel Castro's book will change your way of thinking for the better. All around us we see the ""victim"" mentality being fostered and fed upon for monetary and political gain. Shake off your victimitis, enrich your thinking with Dan's proven principles and become the power behind your success. Failure is not inherited. Learn how to overcome it by sound, moral thinking, by overcoming the tricks your mind plays on you, and by focusing on the truth.Personal and historical examples aptly illustrate the above. Not only did I enjoy this book, I will use it and share it."
2,"Confusing Use of ""Heroes""","His 7 laws of critical focus are an attempt to provide parameters for the book. However, they are too loosely and inappropriately applied to the various people he highlights. They are also simplistic, covering about one page or less of a Psychology 101 textbook. It is very basic information on how our senses (we) selectively focus, and he adds essentially nothing to justify the elevation of these facts to ""heroic"" status."
5,I LOVED THIS DOCUMENTARY!!,"The set of DVD's was high quality and worked just fine, And the documentary was quite entertaining. If you're interested in learning about the mob or just love documentarys this is a good one. Highly recommended."
5,the best solo album rick wakeman ever conceived.,"i am probably going to stick my foot in it but reviews are simply opinions and my opinion is this is the best solo effort by mr. wakeman...ever. i feel that his best work was with yes and not as a solo artist. it takes more than facility at a keyboard to create a cohesive and interesting composition. like so many artists both historically and currently popular, mastery of an instrument does not automatically give rise to compositional talent. i have listened to and followed his career since the strawbs and i hold to my opening remarks. i also feel that yes has done equally well with the various keyboard players that have been a part of their history. i am not of the camp that believes rick wakeman is part of their ""classic"" lineup since they are still creating superb sounds and performing stellar concerts. in closing, i find it interesting that the album in review has several members of yes as guest artists."
4,Concept album,"After The Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"" and The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" it became a hype in the seventies to make a ""concept album"".Rick Wakeman's ""Six Wives of Henry VIII"" is one of those albums.When he worked on this album he still was a member of the band 'Yes'. The other band members are on some of the tracks.I already had the LP, but thought it was time to have a CD version.It's a rather 'baroque' album, with Wakeman using all sorts of keyboard instruments, even a church organ!Looking back on this work of music I was surprised to discover the compositions aren't as difficult as I thought, but have simple chords.Could that be the reason that the album is easy to listen to?"
2,"I like Wakeman with ""Yes"" and ""Strawbs"" but not alone","I saw Wakeman on stage at the time of his solo career, and I didn't like it.I heard his solo albums and I never liked them.Why? I think because it's too much influenced by old classical music, the kind I also do not like.With the bands ""Yes"" and ""Strawbs"", the progressive trend and orientation of the rest of the group was perhaps forcing Wakeman to dig in that same direction, and that resulted in some really outstanding musical discoveries.But left alone...Maybe another reason for me not to like the solo albums is my tendency to favor music in minor (which sounds rather sad) as opposed to music in major (which sounds more ""happy"" if I can say that)Apart from this, I have to agree that Wakeman is technically very powerful. And lots of my friends did love these albums at the time they came out.So I suppose it's purely a question of taste in the end."
1,"Boy, What A Stinker!!","I roll my eyes every time I hear someone speak about Ricky's ""musical textures."" This is still another example of Wakeman's pretentious attempt to become known as a ""serious rock musician."" In the words of a famous Roman emperor, ""I listened, I broke up laughing, I kept the receipt and got my dough back from the record store."" This album is the Pulp Fiction of progressive rock, the Mickey Spillane in a genre otherwise mostly populated with artists with a sincere vision and edgy creativity. If Anne Boleyn could have known that this album was on its way in the future, she'd have spared Henry VIII the trouble and simply hanged herself. A truly laughable stinker!"
2,"Rick - outstanding, cd music quality - crappy","I really love this selection of instrumental pieces by Rick Wakeman. His music is unique and, well, simply brilliant. I was thouroughly dissapointed with the quality of the music on the CD though. It was flat and sounded like some garage recording on cheap outdated equipment. My recomendation to others is try to find a remastered copy of this work (if it exists)."
5,blows you away!!,"when i first bought this record i did not knew what i was getting, but then i played it and let me tell you something it was great, i mean all of the pieces were amazing, i personally enjoyed track number 5, i don`t know it justhas something mystic about it, how it changes tempo, it blew me away, this type of work really tells you what kinde of musician was rick, he`s great, good `ole prog rock to really expand your mind!!after all he comes from one hella`va of a band"
3,Review,I am still getting used to this one. I am however enjoying it. No doubt it will grow on me over time and I will like it as much as I like the other two.
5,The Definitive Wakeman Album,"Put simply, this album is THE album from Mr Wakeman. I love virtually everything he has ever done, but his first three albums are still his best three albums, and ""6 Wives"" is the best of them all. It has not aged in nearly 30 years and can still be listened to almost as if for the first time. When it was first released it broke barriers of inventiveness and originality, both in terms of genre and of sound. Rick's playing sounds good on any keyboard, but with this album you are taken through the best of all the keyboards available back in 1973 (and, frankly, they are still the best). A masterpiece."
4,Just Nearly 5 Stars,"If you are a big fan of keyboard-drenched songs, this album is close to heaven. Rick Wakeman's playing is masterful as always, and the songs are wonderfullyarranged and produced; this is one of the rare older CDs with excellent sound quality. Wakeman is not the only star, either. The other instruments (guitar, bass, etc.) all stand out at times, and drums are particularly excellent. All the songs are good. This is a must for Wakeman fans, and many others should check it out."
2,"Overlong, Overdone, vaguely pompus...","I too heard this album upon its original release in the early 70's and was quite impressed with it at the time. Having recently purchased the CD I still do find the recording interesting. I do not believe it has aged well though, being overblown, overlong and vaguely pompus. Although the compositions are well done ""mathematically"", they are sometimes strangely devoid of actual melody. No doubt that the composer had some clout and influence, in those days, as one can clearly hear echos of his style and technique in later music ranging from groups as diverse as Queen to (particularly) Kansas."
4,A young girl tests her courage and faith during WWI.,"Sent by her uncle to work on a truck farm during WWI, pretty, gentle Hilda Lessing uncovers a nest of German spies and risks her life to bring them to justice. Her faith and courage bring the admiration of a young train engineer."
4,Nice Book,As always Grace Livingston Hill books are a favorite. This one has action and wonderful story line from a time in our country when patriotism was high.
5,"Trains, spies, and true love!","Hilda Lessing is the heroine of The Red Signal. The book takes place during World War I, Hilda is sent by her uncle Otto to work on a farm run by German immigrants. She meets the hero of the story Dan Stevens almost at once when he saves her from being ran over by a train. Shortly after arriving at the farm she realizes not everyone is as they seem and in factthey are spies for Germany. The book is a good, I enjoyed the action and the understated romance between Hilda and Dan. The only complaint I have is that Hilda is extremely naive, but I excuse this because the book was written in 1919. Mrs. Hill wrote many books but this is one of my favorites."
1,Chicco Dicati,"Purchased this toy for my 3 year old. Motorcylcles move too slowly and most of the time, they don't work...would not recommend this toy."
2,"Nice concept, bad product","My boys were so excited about this toy. I have three year old twins and they couldn't wait to race their motorcycles, but this toy has been a total letdown. One of the remote controls arrived with the battery compartment messed up. The springs were on BOTH connectors for one battery and neither connector for the other battery. My husband is a bit of an electrician and managed to fix that. When we were finally up and running, we discovered that the motorcycles consistently fall off the track at the ""bump"" in the road, making it impossible to race. The plus of the toy is that the remote is really easy to use, even for a three year old. My boys enjoy the toy as long as someone is sitting there to pick up the motorcycle and put it back on the track. The inability to actually race the motorcycles, however, is a real disappointment."
4,Works great for 10 bucks,I Bought this drill a month back. Initially I was disappointed that it does not have variable speed. But after few usage I am comfortable. It works great.
1,Save your cash,I used it once and never used it again..... If you want to show off that you have one but don't expect to use it then go for it.
2,Not worth the cheap price...,"Bought 3 of these for $15 each and shipped - That would be the only good thing about these.2 out of the 3, the batteries had died 3 months after purchase.Got replacement batteries shipped direct from China on Drivemaster.Our 3rd drill runs on its own all the time. The only way to stop it, is by pulling the battery out.These drills are 9 months old and still under their 1 year warranty - going to call AGAIN and get replacement...Thanks Drivemaster"
1,Worked for 3 months,"I used this drill 5 times in three monts. It wasn't the best drill but doing the job. After a while, the AC adapter stopped charging the battery. I am not sure if the battery is dead or the charger, all I know is I spent 15 for renting a drill for 5 time usage and some headache."
2,cheap,feels really really cheap. seems to work but not haveing variable speed is a big limitation. just got it so not sure how long it'll last but we'll see.
4,Decent drill for the money,"If you are looking for a work tool, you should probably spend a little more and get a nice brand name drill. If you just need something for around the house, this works great. So far no problems with it, has enough power to do everyday home tasks, and it's confortable to hold and to use."
1,Drill direction change buttons barely work,"I bought this for a friend who has some hand use issues - I thought the weight, etc would be good. BUT when I got the drill, the buttons used to shift from forward to reverse barely worked. I don't have hand issues and I couldn't push the buttons and change direction easily. So I returned the drill right away - guess I'll do the old Home Depot trip for this gift so I can be sure it works like it's supposed to."
4,Good for the price,"This drill will get the job done but I would not recommend it if it you plan to use it heavily. The weight and size is OK but it doesn't seem to be balanced well. The variable speed range on the trigger button is not as smooth and consisitent as it should be. The forward/reverse button is just out of position and hard to press so you need to use your other hand to switch directions. Other than that, it works great."
1,worthles tool,"you get what you pay, this ""drill"" is worth less than what I paid, I will watch out what I buy from now on in Amazon. buy name brand"
4,"I thought ""Torque Control"" = Variable Speed",I should have read the review a bit better. This drill is not variable speed. No big deal I guess. I'm keeping it for $15 bucks. Keep an eye on it. It seems to go from $15 to $20 pretty regularly.
4,Good solid drill for the weekend warrior,"I was a little hesitant when I read a couple of the reviews and considering the price I thought I was getting this wimpy, little drill that wouldn't be able to hold up. I was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived. This drill is bigger, more solid and more powerful than my old drill (Black and Decker 12V) and I was perfectly happy with that one. The one thing that it doesn't have is the variable speed benefit...it just kicks right it - but good power. I noticed this being a bit of an issue when removing screws, no finesse, so you have to kind of tap the power button to initially turn the screw otherwise you can strip the head...but no big deal if you put some decent pressure on the screw while turning. The direction button (forward/reverse) is right by the power button for convenient use but it is plastic and seems a bit cheap but $10 for this drill is a very good buy in my opinion...and am confident this drill will last."
5,Good drill at a great price,I was making my own platform bed and this dril performed pretty well. It is a powerfull drill and the variable torque can be handy for screwing. You should not miss out on this deal as long as it is $10.
4,Nice story~,Alex Fairchild was back and Judith was hoping he didn't remember her. 7 years ago she had allowed him to seduce her then learned that he had done it to even an old score. Judith was due to be married soon Alex was determined to get another chance.
1,Do Not Buy This CD From Amazon,"I ordered this CD from amazon on March 5, 2004 with an estimated delivery date of 2 to 4 weeks. Today is May 4 and their ""where's my stuff"" shows this item still not shipped and an anticipated delivery date between May 9 and May 17. Oddly, the site listing the information for the CD says ""ships between 3 and 5 weeks"". I would suggest that if you are interested in this CD that you buy it elsewhere that the vendor does NOT post misleading information as to availability.Just my two cents"
5,Relaxing Read,"I read this book 20 years ago, and enjoyed it very much. It is a slow, relaxing south-to-north hiking tour of the spine of Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats. Hillaby is a veddy, veddy English writer with an engaging style. I suspect that much of the landscapes and villages he hiked through in the 1960s are much changed today, so the book is probably a retro look at the way things were. I would recommend it anyway. Walk along with Hillaby. You won't be disappointed."
4,Typical Bollywood movie of 1960s,"The score by Madan Mohan is the stand out feature of this movie. Rafi's song "" Yun rooto na hasina"" and it's picturization on Shashi Kapoor is one of the highlights of this movie. The movie is unusual in one respect : This is about Indian Muslims about their culture and lives. The actors are all Hindus, Shashi Kapoor , Nanda and so on. A truly secular movie and was a hit in those days. Shashi and Nanda's youthful enthusiasm is one of the best points about this movie. Omprakash portrayal as hajam Nawab is quite humorous. Balraj Sahni gives a subdued performance. This movie also enshrines the principle of equality of all humans and the differences made out among humans are all man made and artificial.This movie is of great nostalgic value to the reviewer."
4,Gift for friend,"I gave this book as a gift. My friend has not told me, as yet, if she has used recipes or not."
1,"Beautiful cookbook, but faulty editing","I love the cookbook. Unfortunately, it is ruined by faulty editing of too many of the receipts. For example, ONE CUP of minced garlic in 3.5 cups of chimicurri sauce? FOUR POUNDS of beets for a soup this supposed to serve 6-8? 3.5 TEASPOONS of baking soda for parmesan pan biscuits that makes 12 biscuits."
3,amusing,This book has great pictures and fairly good recipes. Its kind of a yuppy moves to the west and lets get into the life style of Montana book.
2,a bit overrated though not boring,"I can't review the dvd since it has not come out yet but I will review the movie in general. The character of Duke Togo is a professional assassin who like James Bond, doesn't let emotion get in the way of his job. Now I'm not comparing the overall movie to James Bond though the opening title sequence of Golgo 13 is very similar to a title sequence that you would see in a Bond flick. Anyway, the plot held my interest to some degree but even for 90 minutes the movie seemed to drag at times. Duke Togo sleeps with the women he comes in contact with, even the one he is assigned to kill (James Bond anyone?). Golgo 13 starts to pick up near the end and I have to give this movie credit for having a good showdown between Duke and the hired hitmen out to get him, especially that Snake character. Now I know that some anime reviewers will hate me for giving this movie two stars but quite honestly I have seen better anime."
3,"Don't Expect Ken Burns, and you won't be disappointed...","Extremely in-depth look at the major battles of the Civil War. I would say this 10-part, 3 DVD set is worth the $5 I paid for it at the big box store. It is not well produced. Lots of use of re-enactment footage, but the same clips of footage are used over & over to coincide with descriptions of battles. I believe that ALL of the footage in these DVDs actually came from one re-enactment.... from the Perryville Reenactment, when it was the major reenactment of the year, a few years ago."
3,Poorly Produced Documentary,"I purchased this set for $5 at a major chain store. I must say it's barely worth what I paid. It's poorly produced and the editing is shotty at best. The voicover and historical value is the only redeeming quality this set offers.The re-enactments are not to my liking, but they're tolerable (when the same scenes aren't being repeated and repeated!)Here's the kick...The credit segments at the end of each episode are over 2 minutes...what's up with that! So many credited people couldn't spin a decent product? This will never be shown on anything but some public access channel. Buy at your own risk.Ken Burns this is NOT"
3,A good beginning,"I have read many of Peter Traymane's Sister Fidelma books and was looking for more information about early Ireland without a story involved. Although this book is a good basic informational text, it did not have the depth of information I was looking for. I wanted much more information about the laws and the rights of women in this early period."
4,a good overview of the subject,"Ellis is one of the better scholars presently writing about the Celts and their culture and mythology. I enjoyed this volume as a general overview of Celtic civilization. But as a few other readers have commented, the organization of the sources he cites could be a bit better. Still, his writing style is clear and his facts are accurate."
3,Some worked,"I bought a few of these for a school that I work at. The First two worked fine but the last three over heated and started to smoke. I put them in other projectors just to check that off the list of possibilities, and the same thing. I put one of the first ones in the same projector and it worked fine. So two out of the five we bought worked fine. In the long run I should just have bought genuine parts..."
1,Product Defective,"While priced right and shipping was exceptional, the life of the product was very short. Typical lifespan on a bulb like this has lasted me a year. This died in 5 weeks of minimal use. Product returned."
5,good good good good good,"This is hands down one of the best albums i have heard in my life. To me, it is unfathomable that anyone wouldnt like this one. It has everything you could possibly ask for in an album, and everything is drilled down to perfection. I waited a long time for this re release and it is nothing short of spectacular. If you like alt rock or psychedelic rock or just music in general, and hate the stuff they play on the radio, then this one is for you. Highlights include Russia On Ice and Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled. Check it out. It has been unavailable for a long time and now its back, so pick up a copy while you can."
5,Lele,"Buonasera, volevo complimentarmi con tutto lo staff, le spedizioni sono velocissime e i prodotti sono come nella descrizione, non c' è pericolo di truffa. Consigliati. EMANUELE"
4,One of the best bands recording,"While not quite as good as their previous effort, ""Stupid Dream"", this is still an excellent album. The Tree is moving closer to the pop center with this cd. Some prog rock fans will be put off by the simplicity of the instrumentation on this one. If you own no Porcupine Tree albums buy ""Stupid Dream"". Then buy this one and support Steven Wilson and some of the best music being made today."
4,Best CD from the band?,"Saw them live for the first time a few months ago and what an amazing band. This CD was purchased for three songs, hatesong, lightbulb sun and russia on ice but soon loved every song. If you like Deadwing and In Absentia you must have this also."
4,Porcupine Medicine,"Thank you Steven Wilson and company for providing more Porcupine Tree music which I find I must have periodically to exist musically. Since Fear of A Blank Planet, I have been yearning for more and I'm sorry to say Nil Recurring did not do it for me. This recording is a very nice mellow album heavey on acoustic guitar which is a triumph from the English lads. Bravo! Lightbulb Sun gives us some really solid tunes in How Is Your Life Today (shades of the Beatles), Shesmovedon (a personal favorite), The Rest Will Flow, Russia On Ice (with its slow build up and epic length at 13:03)and the catchy ""Hatesong"". I highly recommend this album to any Porcupine Tree fans or folks tired of the same old radio BS being ""manufactured"" to sell cars and fast food. Ciao."
3,"Not bad, but not good.","Though there are some nice melodies and harmonization it seems PT gets satisfied well before it should. They take comfort in rapid reprise and semi-dated guitar riffs. This is understandable as Wilson seems to be able to reproduce the sound of several adequate guitarists (most obviously Fripp).I have a tendency to be harsher in this review than perhaps I should, but it's only because the Band seems to have an understanding of what good music is. There is layering and atmosphere, but again there seems to be a real fear of letting go of a very basic comfort level; the copy guitar.Something needs to change, mainly because they are close to being good. Perhaps someone else should be in charge of lyrics and guitar next time. The sound should be more complex. More melody in melody in melody. Less talking about feelings, and more feeling. Where is the Hate in Hatesong? Best wishes."
2,"If you're a long term PT fan, Lightbulb might NOT be good","You can read all the hype above. But it just doesn't cover the entire story.Chances are, if you really like this band from their spacier explorations, that you've already gotten this disc. However, if you loved Porc Tree for the depth of sound and space--this release does NOT continue that sound.This really disappointed me. Yes, I know that last year's release also was more song oriented, as is Lightbulb Sun. But this one is SO introspective, that it sounds like Steve Wilson's life has gone to hell. Very limited instrumental space. It seems that ""voyage"" of the tree is over.So if you're looking for more Floydian/Porc Tree atmospheric music--it ain't here. If you want a collection of really sad songs, buy this."
2,Mediocre pseudo prog.,"Porcupine Tree's preceding effort, Stupid Dream, had it's flaws but was far superior to this aimless effort. Wilson has his talents but needs to pay some serious attention to improving his guitar work. He would also be well advised to wait until he has something to say before stepping into the studio. This is really an uninspired mess. Even the band's understated but creative sense of rhythm on Stupid Dream is absent here. You'd be much better off turning to the Flower Kings...Simon"
2,weak and whiny,"This is 4th p. tree album and it's the weakest of them all. It seems to be mostly about taking pills and watchin tv and this band is at it's worst (in my opinion) when they are noodling through piano and synthesizer parts with the plodding ambient etheral effect. his voice full of reverb and whiny and tinny. Fear of blank planet was sooo much better, it moved and had more foundation to it. this album sounds like the structure is gone, it just rolls one song into the next getting more depressing as it goes. Listen to first track on fear of... that is when they are at there best, and this album is devoid of any refreshing heavy parts like that are on fear of... should i even bother with stupid dream? or should i go retro, further back?"
5,"Simply a very, very good album!!","Porcupine Tree have hit a musical nerve with me.After 43 years of listening to good music I now realize it was all just a prelude to Porcupine Tree. This album is amazing.I own almost all of their music. When I leave for work or use my computer I must listen to something by Porcupine Tree.Lightbulb Sun as well as another truly fantastic album called Stupid Dream will make you think ""Wow, excellent music is alive and well"".Get it >> You will love it"
3,"OK, nothing special","Well, in 1998 CFS was great, the graphics and all, in 2000, well it is getting left in the wake of others. The game, while it has a large number of aircraft to choose from, is nothing special as there are literally thousands on the net. If you already have Abacus' pacific theatre expect more of the same but in africa and italy. The graphics are still good but are getting tired and old. The missions are nothing special, nor are the allied pilot AI, they must think war is a spectator sport, you are left to take out all of the enemy pilots on your own and the only kill thay make is one that you have already seveerly damaged. the sound is fine and game play is sound, but the same as the original."
4,The first story your child will be able to understand,"I have a real fondness for this book, because it's the first story my son was able to understand. It's about two dogs, Big Dog and Little Dog. They become hungry, eat, and then curl up together to go to sleep. It's a very simple story, with very simple pictures, told in very simple language: ""Big Dog is hungry...Little Dog is hungry, too...Big Dog is sleepy...."" And therein lies its magic. It's so darn simple that a baby can understand it. My son was not quite one when I started reading it to him. I remember being so excited at the prospect of a real story after all those months of ""naming"" books. And when I realized he understood what was going on, it was heaven. Now my son is two and a half and has moved on, so to speak. (The book is probably best enjoyed by the under-two crowd.) But this book has become one of my standard baby gifts."
3,Kodak Easyshare Printer Dock,"This product is temperamental. Sometimes it prints and sometimes itasks for ""paper"" when it has paper. When I get it going it prints for upto four and shuts down again. The shipper had it well wrapped and was generous with supplies."
3,Missing Pieces,"The printer dock arrived without a cable necessary for it to function. Fortunately, I had an older version whose cable fit. If I had not, I would have wasted my money."
1,Disappointed,"Kodak cx6330 camera was given to me by my family as a Christmas gift. It stopped working after using it three times. At first I thought it was the battery, but after charging it all night the camera still didn't work. Bought a new battery ($14.00), charged it and still the camera did not work. After emailing the Kodak center I was told that the camera needed to be returned."
3,"Great quality, super convenient, and expensive to use","This little printer spits out borderless 4x6 photos that are completely indistinguishable from those you would get from a photo lab. However, each 4x6 print costs, according to my calculations, just over 62 cents--and that's just for consumables (paper and cartridges) and does not factor in the price of the unit itself. Think about that before you buy it. My wife can't live without this thing because of how nice it is to have great looking photos printed on demand. I'm not so sure the convenience justifies the price."
4,Autism and this book,"I have a ASD kid of 6 years - Tanishk - of the Toys R Us fame in April 2012When he was 4 years old, a floortime specialist suggested I read up this book- it took me close to 2 years to borrow this book from the library and go through ..It has options for a parent to follow through with the child and most do not fall within the verbal category, but movements and directions stressing thinking1. They were easy to do with my kid - which was great as most therapy is not easy to do and anything verbal actually is an abstraction for anyone2. I saw him actually think through things like the cross walk in reverse - he was doing it even when I was not looking"
5,Timeless practical developmental activities,"Four decades later, the practice of behavioral optometry and the thinking games embodied in this work are as timeless as the theories of Piaget. Parents and practitioners alike can instantly engage learners with improvised equipment. The ""magic"" is in the doing, not the materials. Schools may still not be ready to ""teach"" thinking, but learning would be facilitated if thinking was nurtured."
2,Noisy!,"It works, but damn this thing is noisy. It has quieted down a ""little"" after a year, but that's not saying much. For the first 6 months it was embarrassing driving around with this thing. I've tried every trick I could find to get rid of the noise, but it's just a whiny pump plain and simple."
2,Not Whoa,This song was not that hot and was not good for a great comeback it had sucess but the single failed expecially on Mya'sPart this song could have been a lot better not recomendedLyrics 3/10 Production 6/10 Overall 4.5/10
2,not all that,okay mya's talking about how good she is in bed really boring but she does have a nice body.
4,Good for the money,"Overall a nice product, but I have noticed that this flatware seems to get more ""spotty"" in the dishwasher than my previous set. Also, a few of the knives have developed rust-like blemishes where the handle meets the blade, but it's hardly noticeable. This is definately nicer than my previous cheap set, but it doesn't have the same heft or ""quality feel"" that the my Heirloom Oneida flatware has. Overall, I love the way this flatware looks, and it has very nice serving pieces included in the set."
3,Disappointing,"I had to buy new flatware after misplacing my inexpensive 15 year old Oneida set following a move and a remodel. I bought this for the look and the Henckels name; however, we found and are back to using the non-stained, non-rusted, old Oneida every day. The Henckels has rust spots on several pieces--yes, like everyone else, especially on the knives. Seems to scratch easily and often needs a little buffing. We use it mostly for small, casual dinner parties simply because I love the look; I just wish the quality were there."
2,Definitely rust and water marks,"We've had this set for years (came with my husband, so I'm guessing he's had them for about 4 years). Although we love the design, I am very disappointed in the rust. Also, one knife now rattles - something has come loose inside. Apparently they come with a lifetime replacement, so I'm going to look into that. Good luck."
2,Rusty Knives,"I have purchased this service for eight, and 6 of my 8 knives so far have rust. There seems to be a flaw at a stress point where the blade meets the handle. Every knife has the rust in the same locations. I do not have a dishwasher, they have always been hand washed. Only my knives are affected."
5,Great camping/backpacking blanket,My daughter used this backpacking through Europe. It is lightweight and easy to carry in a backpack but warm.
5,Stuff Sack Pillow,This is a great light weight luxury item for backpackers. I stuff my fleece jacket in it for a comfy pillow. Great product.
5,Perfect,Used for camping mid 40's temperature was ideal with a silk sleep sack in a 20 degree bag. Therm-a-rest products are awsome.
1,The size advertised is not even close to correct.,"Ordered and received the large 58"" x 80"" blanket. Unfortunately the blanket is well under 70"" inches long. This product is not labelled or advertised by therm a rest correctly."
5,Therma-Rest Blanket,"Wow, this product met and exceeded my expectations. Shipping was a bit slow but the blanket is great. I love how the bottom can be pulled with the draw string. If you draw the string and do the closest snap to the bottom you can keep your feet snug and the blanket stays down. It fits nicely inside my large sleeping bag. I am looking to buy another one!"
5,lightweight sleep system,"I have two of these and I love them. You can snap them to other Thermarest items or even to each other. I take these camping and it is a perfect lightweight alternative to sleeping bags. My daughter moves around way too much in her sleep to ever stay in a sleeping bag, so these have worked very well for us. I tuck these under our sleeping pad and to add extra warmth to our feet I toss a fleece blanket in the foot area and we're fine. I wouldn't use these for winter camping, but they've been used and were perfect for camping from April - August in Colorado."
1,not size advertised,"I bought two of these am returning because reg size only 70""x41"" not 76""x48"" alittle small I dont like being missled I want what I ordered.Problem NOT with amazon therm a rest company is problem"
2,Big Tube Stain,"Wow, what a shame. This is a great 5 star CD as far as the music goes, but is one of the worst mastering ""jobs"" ever. Were these guys smoking, drinking, snorting, tripping or all of the above when they decided to remaster this classic Tubes / Todd Rundgren masterpiece? American Beat ought to take all of these CD's back and recycle them into something useful like a beer can or a tanning mirror. Hopefully someone with actual know how will get the rights to this CD and remaster it again and hopefully do it right next time. Five stars for the music, 0 stars for the sound quality."
1,Horrible audio quality,"I love the Tubes. I love Todd. I love this record, but this CD rendition is so sonically flat that it is almost unlistenable. NO highs. NO lows. Muddy (at best) midranges. I had this in my car CD changer on a road trip and it followed Completion Backward Principle and Love Bomb, both of which kick hiney at volume. When Remote Control came on I thought my player had malfunctioned. A *major* disappointment that didn't have to be...the material is magic, but this representation of the material is just beyond poor."
3,My favorite Tubes album because Todd Rundgren produced it,"This album has been ripped by the majority of Tubes affectionados but I like it. You know why? Because it was produced by Todd Rundgren and has a very ""Todd ""sounding vibe to it (especially ""Loves a Mystery"" and ""I want it all now"").I saw the original ""Remote Control"" tour and it was mesmerizing. Fee Waybill was a fanatastic front man.The cd sounds dated, will never hold up to ""White Punks on Dope"" but it is still an interesting work. I think that this is [essentially] a great Todd Rundgren album!"
3,I dunno.....,this isn't one of my favorites. Maybe it's a little too much Todd in the grooves and behind the scene and behind the board. It's a Rundgren sound and not the rawer Tubes sound. The first album seems to still be my favorite.
3,Great Album - Poor Sound,"This is probably the best Tubes album in terms of mixing their quirky funny attitude with catchy commercial-potential songs. Completion Backward Principle that followed was quite a bit more commercial, and while excellent, I prefer Remote Control as my favorite Tubes album. Anyway, this issue on American Beat loses two stars for lousy sound quality (especially since it's purported to be a ""remaster"", which is hard to believe). I compared it to my old Japanese CD pressing and though the American Beat version has a higher volume level, if you adust for that, the old Japanese issue beats it hands down in terms of clarity. The American Beat version actually sounds harsh, mid-rangey, and distorted at times. Plus there is an annoying stereo separation gimmick for effect in the instrumental intro of the first track that I don't recall on the vinyl and is certainly not on the Jap version. I don't think it works well."
1,"Great album, disappointing sound","This has to be one of my favorite Tubes albums as I am both a Tubes and Todd Rundgren fan. The sound of this reissue, however, is a major disappointment. I remember the clear crisp sound of my vinyl copy and this CD does not come close to it. My vinyl copy was misplaced long ago so I was very happy when this reissue surfaced. This CD sounds like it may have been remastered from a cassette tape of the album. The Tubes trademark synthesizers have no sizzle at all. All of the snap and punch of the drums and percussion were absent. When I first opened the CD I thought it was a bit odd that there was no mention of the person or studio that remastered this disk. After my first listen, I realize why."
5,GREAT OBSERVATIONS,"For those who enjoy great rock n' roll coupled with interesting and observational lyrics this album is an excellent choice. The ideas are interesting, well observed and executed in a 5 star delivery. This is in short supply these days, with so much meaningfree lyrics and way too familiar frasings.""Remote Control"" is for people who not only enjoy the act of thinking but can also smile at the quirky idiosyncracsies of an important part of American living."
3,Not The Best But Good Enough,"At times the author wrote as if he was writing a novel instead of a chess book, but it is still a good book. There are some problems with it though. I can't stand Descriptive Notation (1.P-K4 P-K4, 2.N-KB3 N-QB3, etc.). He also assumes way too much out of the reader. Such as, after showing an even position he states a line of moves and ends with,""And White is clearly better and wins"". What truly makes it irritating is when I put the position on Fritz and let the computer play it out it draws everytime. So where is the clear win? The way Znosko breaks down chess into the three elements (Time, Space, & Force) is awesome. I wish Jeremy Silman would have done it this way in his book Reassess Your Chess. But if both books are purchased and studied I believe the reader will come out ahead. Overall, a good book, not the best, but good. Definitely worth the cover price at least."
5,The Middle Game in Chess,This book is old but it is still a good chess study book. I not only recomment this book by the author but all his chess books. They are all excellent. I was pleased with the service by the seller.
1,TERRIBLE Edition,"The diagrams in this edition, which are essential to understanding many of the examples the author gives, are illegible. Imagine trying to read any chess book where the diagrams appear to be illegible photocopies of the original edition."
1,HMMMMM?,It is a map Of the OG WOW....But it does look too much like a com. map and not an awesome laminated double sided map of Azeroth!Look at the curser for gods sake!!
5,Excellent service!,"I ordered this and found some wonderful songs that I wish I'd had for a 50th Anniversary! Now that there are many more 50th anniversaries coming up, I'll be sure to bring this CD with me!"
2,Good story but......,"This is a story with great potential. However, the author really needs to get an editor. I will admit that I did not finish the story, not because of the story itself, but because of all the typos. There were numerous words that had no spaces between them, misspelled words, and double words (for example: gun,gun). I would not recommend getting the Kindle version until the book is redone to fix the issues."
2,"Nice try, could have been better...","""Prayer at Rumayla"" was a good concept, but never materialized into a good book. Too many obvious print/spelling/grammar errors were present that an editor should have picked up, and the story was just too quick. Characters could have been developed more, and the main character (Chet Brown) used the same phrases over and over. On the positive side, I like the way it moved back and forth from past and present. It was a quick, and reasonably entertaining book. I would recommend it as a read because of the insights that come through from the authors experience in the gulf."
5,These hold up,I bought these out of nostalgia and these still hold up today. I played with these with my brother as a child and I still enjoy them today.
5,Classic TJB,"Ignore the silly gripe in that other review that lamented the decision to offer only the stereo mix of this cd. Herb wisely embraced stereo, not mono. So thankfully the mono sources were not utilized on this cd. The remaster job is good, although a little more treble would benefit the entire Signatutre series...They sound a tad muffled. But their reisssues are definately a highlight of 2005. I look forward to more to come...But ""What Now My Love"" is their best album ever! It's a pleasure to hear again and again...Cheers to you Herb and the entire team responsible for the reissues. The covers reproductions and inside booklets are delicious and great fun...just like the music itself. Bravo!"
4,A true classic,Lots of familiar classics that quickly lift your spirits and get your feet tapping. Listening to this CD can't help but put you into a good mood.
5,"One of the best albums of the 60's, maybe of any era!","It's not being too bold when stating that this collection of songs is as good as TJB has ever compiled. Fresh, jazzy, moody, seductive are just some of the words that come to mind when listening to this jewel. If 9 weeks at number one and two grammy awards doesn't grab you, the music absolutely will. There is not one song here that disappoints as they take you from tropical Cantina Blue to dancing bar mitzvah style with If I Were A Rich Man. And what about the fabulous It Was A Very Good Year? By beating Sinatra to the punch, Herb Alpert and TJB set the tone for a classic! Sit back and enjoy an album for the ages, over and over again."
1,BIG Loser,"I bought this after purchasing my first kettlebell. Bob's instruction was done from a small dark room, he is far from encouraging, he makes fun of the girl demonstrating his moves because she does them wrong often. Hard to follow because the girl doing the moves can't even follow Bob. Not helpful at all, buy Jillian Micheals kettlebell video instead, she is encouraging, offers different levels, and shows you how to start with a regular weight if you aren't sure about purchasing a kettleBell. I will never buy one of BOB's videos again."
3,60yrsoldandstillkicking,"some kettlebell work - much high level floor exercise without the kettlebell - walking pushups - too high level for me and i enjoy a challenge but not that big a challenge - i'm 60 yrs old and even 5 or 25 yrs ago wouldn't have been looking for a challenge like doing walking pushups.maybe good for the ""insanity workout level"" - not a normal challenging workout...at least not for me.was looking for a full kettlebell workout but didnt find on this dvd."
3,Bobs bells.,"Big fan of this guy and never hit the kettel bells so thought i would try this dvd to get started.He is a good instructor so nothing wrong there. The whole studio set up however, seemed small and cramped .The program is way too long for my needs, was hoping for some 20 minute sequences to do in the morning before work. I think although the content i good - he knows what he is about , the total presentation comes across as being low budget."
5,Love it!!,I have tried 3 different videos and this one is by far the best one. The other videos just don't do as good of a job as Bob in getting your heart rate up and really working the whole body.
4,basic workout,"I personally think Bob Harper is totally under rated! This is the guy who whips your ass into shape by any means. He really is great. This DVD happens to be my least favorite. Its a good total body workout, excellent for beginner kettle bell users. You will sweat! I reccomend the inside out method ""Body Rev CARDIO conditioning or ""PURE BURN Super Strenght if you want something a little more challenging."
2,Blabby Bob,"This video is a hard kettle bell workout, however I got it to learn new exercises, which I did not. First of all, Bob Harper talks WAY TOO MUCH! He wastes at least 5-10 minutes out of the 50 min workout with his wordy, repititious instructions. Also, he only does approximately 5 different exercises and just repeats the s*@% out of them. Overall disappointed with this purchase!"
2,Bob Harper kettlebell Sculpted Body,"I bought this DVD recently and I found it which is the boring DVD I've ever had! So far I haven't started to workout with this DVD yet!The DVD is nearly one hour long, no background music ! And every workout last too long !Actually, just feel like a robot doing the exercise , no fun at all!I bought this DVD because Bob Harper but in the DVD most of the time showing how to do the exercise is the woman named Stephanie not him ! No wonder after a few exercises she is struggling."
4,Great Workout!! Bob rocks!,"I have 2 other Bob Harper workout DVDs and am impressed with each one. I would recommend the kettlebell workout in a heartbeat. Intense and you'll feel great afterwards. The DVD is about 50 minutes, and if you buy a Bob Harper kettle bell, there is a 30 minute DVD included. I alternate depending on time. I bought the 15 pound kettle bell and will now buy a 10 pound for the overhead clings and think I will also buy a 20 pound for the basic moves. I agree with another reviewer to not be afraid of the weight. With kettlebells you rely on momentum in most moves so you'll find the weight easier as you go. Have fun! And I hope Bob keeps making more DVDs. I like Jillian Michaels as well. Variety is what keeps me interested and moving!"
3,"Great DVD, but if you purchase one, you've purchased all!!!!!","If you purchase this dvd you don't have to purchase Bob Harper: Kettlebell cardio shred, because he does the same exact moves. Instead, invest you money in Jillian's ripped in 30, 4 different workouts, and she never repeats a move! You've been warned!"
4,Effective option for cross training at home,"I needed a cross-training workout to supplement my running, and since I don't have time to go to a health club, I gave this a try. I was suprised and pleased to find that Bob's Kettlebell workout really does give me a great strength and cardio workout at home. I agree with other reviews, don't be afraid to move up to the heavier weights (do work up though; if you've never worked out with kettlebells or other weights, I'd take it easy at first). I do this workout 2x per week, and feel I have become a stronger runner after just 3 or 4 weeks. Bob offers a challenging workout. The only downside is I wish there was a version without the instruction and other ""first-timer"" chit-chat; after a week or two I felt I understood the ""how to"" and now I have to fast forward through the instruction. This is also my first workout with kettlebells, and I would definitely recommend these as a convenient and effective way to workout with weights at home."
4,"Nice glasses, a little expensive..",I ordered these for my parents for Christmas as all their glasses were breaking or old. These glasses are pretty nice. I think the price is a little high for just 4 glasses that are plain but they seem to like the glasses quite a bit as they are always out on the table for dinnertime. So that is a good sign as my parents are very picky about stuff like this.
5,An Adult Album,"Except for two of the songs, the selections are very adult for a brother and sister who were only 25 and 21 years old respectively. There are no artists since who have captured the essence of musicianship, loss, and longing so completely."
2,Disappointing and basic; Philosophy for beginners,"He may be a great runner, but this book is ankle-deep philosophy and so basic in its lessons that it seems really designed for a 12-year-old. I would not suggest this book for any adult interested in life lessons or inspiration. It simply doesn't compare to the thoughtful books of people like Wayne Dyer and it's not a good book on running either. For a much better book on running and life, try Haruki Murakami's ""What I talk about when I talk about running."""
4,Simple but deep,"This book was easy to read, straightforward and inspirational. Though not as deep as Sheehan, this book contains simple truths of the joys of running and makes you appreciate not only the mileage put in, but why you do it. I put the book down feeling good about the hours of sweat, a renewed bond with runners in general, and a desire to carry forward in good times and bad. Amby Burfoot, thanks for sharing!"
4,good book,"Inspirational, but not much ""meat"". Good personal examples. I found the sections to be a bit too short for my taste . A bit more elaboration would have been nice."
5,Right On Time,"This book was given to me on my 22nd birthday. I started running this past March with a group of ladies and stopped at the end of July because I let life get in the way. Now I have a renewed outlook on running thanks to this book. My quarterlife crisis can be avoided.I highlighted so many lessons on the meaning of life and how to live it right. There's many lessons for the reader, no matter how old or where you are in life. A book I‘ll make a point to read every birthday from now on."
4,The Course Through Life,"Amby Burfoot may be more known as the long-time editor for Runner's World magazine than for his 1968 victory in the searing heat at the Boston Marathon.Burfoot merges his skill of a journalist with his many years in the sport to deliver wonderful essays on the peaks, valleys and rugged terrain of life. Though the starting line is his running, the course that is mapped out is accessible to those who never laced up a pair of shoes for a marathon or a jaunt around the block.This is a gold medal performance by Burfoot, that comes straight from the heart."
3,Enjoyable but not great,"This slim book is a collection of essays that I would guess have already been published in Runners World magazine where the author works. Heart warming and inspirational to read, but somewhat overpriced considering the paucity of material"
5,Beautiful book about the very spirit of running!,I thought at first that this book was maybe too short and simple as one reviewer put it but I was wrong. The part about Dr. Sheehan a few chapters in is worth everything. This is a beautiful book that any runner would love over and over again! I will savor this book many times over....get it !
3,Cute,I've received a lot of compliments on these. They are much better on carpet than on other floor surfaces as your foot may slide a little bit and you need more control.
3,Magnets fall out so get your glue ready!,"The magnets fall out of the rubber holders almost immediately and stick to the stands. Since the magnets are so small, I lost a few to the cleaning crew until I put my students on the look out. Watch out if you purchase these."
4,Good Compromise,"This yarn is a great compromise for those of us who prefer wool for it's warmth...but need to use acrylic for its ease of care. This yarn is the perfect choice for me for afghans for children - the wool is necessary for warmth and the acrylic is necessary for the washability. It shows great stitch definition and has nice ""heft"". There's nothing wimpy about this yarn.One thing though, unless you order only one skein, it's overpriced here at amazon (which surprises me). Even with shipping, it's less expensive to order directly from lionbrand.com, even when it's not on sale. Sorry amazon."
5,Great!,"This yarn is soft, but strong and because of the larger size, it's super fast to work with. The strands stay together really well, unlike some yarns where you find yourself catching/snagging on half the strand or in places that you don't want to be. One review mentioned a glittery string, and I think that may only be in a few select colors, as mine didn't have that and many of the colors I've seen in stores didn't either. Love it, great for making hats and stuff like that. As one review said, it is probably cheaper to drive to the store and buy it though, if you can find it there."
1,Very unhappy,Made a blanket as a gift and it leave fuzzy and clumps everywhere. Continued to wash and it got fuzzy. Very disappointed after spending over 90 dollars for yarn. [...]
2,Over Priced!,"Wow--this is well over $2 a skein than from the actual manufacturer. Other sellers from other sites have it priced at about $3.50-$4.00. This is disappointing because I do trust shopping online here. Since I can't find this yarn in the stores here anymore, and need a good 8 more skeins to finish this large afghan, I will take a chance and order at the half-price point somewhere else and hope the other site is legit."
4,Yeah it a stove base.,"Not to much to say about this, its a stove base. Hooks to the bottom of your Awesome MSR Whisperlite Universal (New for 2012 model) and helps keep it stable on unstable ground, sand, grass, gravel or snow...if you camp, adventure or hike you know what I mean. If you dont, it helps keep your stove from tipping over and spilling your important food on the ground. Being hungry sucks, dont spill your dinner, buy this and learn how to use it."
3,Perhaps not what you expect,"These are not bad cookies. The texture is somewhat odd, they're hard and somewhat thick. The spelt flavor takes a little getting used to and they have an after taste that reminds me of too much flavor extract. I bought them for my mother who can't have the sugar. Unless you have to stay away from wheat, I would try some of Aunt Gussie's other sugar free cookies."
5,The best book yet on networks,"Duncan Watts' first book, Small Worlds, was an academic sensation that documented his pioneering work on the ties that connect us. 6 Degrees expands these ideas but is written in elegant language engaging to any intellectually curious person. The book is a guide to the connected age with interesting commentary on emergence, epidemics, the madness of crowds, trends, and fads. Reading this book will make you see the world differently."
5,Definitely a monumental work,"I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it higly to anyone who would like to know why this ""world"" is so small.I completely disagree with one reviewer in his comments that the author of this book suffers from the self-importance exultance syndrom. Yes, we have all suffered from the annoyance ""larger than life"" figures that some authers try to impose on us while we have been looking the hidden beef. But, not in this case.In fact, I feel the presentation is thoughtful and humble. Moreover, the writing is elegant, lucid and crisp. The book gives a clear picture of an imprtant emerging field, provides the background of where it came from, and give a vision of how it may evolve. I cannot but admire the creativity, diligence and the vision of the author.Putting down the book, I can still hear the echo of the gasp the auther uttered, ""How did we miss that?"" How can this not be a good read?"
5,Storm 2 1/2?,"It is enjoyable and entertaining rock release. Songwriting skill of Kevin Chalfant, who once worked as Journey vocalist around '93-96, has improved tremendously from Eye Of The Storm album. Overall as Eye Of The Storm, this one is again tried and trued Journey styled album. My honest impression is this one is more solid than Eye... River of Destiny is a masterpiece track collaborated with Jim Peterik(ex-Survivor) who recently made dramatic comeback with his great solo ""Jim Peterik and World Stage"". Summer Of Love is my second favorite track from his album reminding me of pre-Escape era of Journey. Piece Of My Heart, Surrender and Never Stop Loving You are also fine tracks.Although most of the tracks are prepared for the third Storm album, Kevin didn't use the band name Storm because one of the key original members Gregg Rolie is not participating. Kevin says in recent interview with BURRN he will defiitely produce the next Storm album when Gregg returns."
3,little things mean a lot,This item is well made and sharp as a previous review mentionedBUT what none of the reviews point out is that the size or width of thecutter is important - I am no giant but the nippers cover only 1/2 the widthof my nail so I have to make 2 cuts and it takes pressure - perhaps thatis why some of the newer style cutters are more popular like the sekiI have always used the German made ones they still are good but this makesthis nipper useless to metime to order something else
4,Good fun!,"A rather funny movie about this actor who wishes to act in artistic films, but ends up getting roles in comedy films. His wife who cannot concieve a child is bent upon getting her husband married to a gypsy women to get a child. The end is a pleasant surprize. Good fun. Good cinema."
4,so far so good (used on kids 5 and 3),Methods used are very clear in the lecture. As parents we have learned so much and had our parents known of these techniques we would have been better children I am sure. Hind sight is 20/20. Learn all you can from all that have something to teach. Good luck. Good purchase and worth the effort and price. PS. Be sure to follow through and keep to the program! He warns what will happen if you deviate.
1,terrible,"horrible,done in haste for more cash though first one is excellant, second just O.K., third interesting but this one outright bad."
1,A ho-hum read.,"My bookclub read this book and all six of us agreed that it is a thumbs-down. It is boring, there is little depth to Paddock's characters, and no connection of early events in the book to later events. Paddock does a nice job giving every detail about what her characters are wearing, eating for breakfast, and the hotel rooms they stay in, but lacks detail and depth in developing her characters and plot. About half-way through the book, I was barely skimming to find anything worth reading. Don't waste your time on this one!"
5,Wonderful!,"A Secret Word is a wonderful book. I really liked the unique structure and the connections between the characters (especially the scenes between Leigh and Mr. & Mrs. Carey). I also liked the last chapter a lot, where the girls are in different physical places, but they all seem like they are in a similar place in life and moving on in a positive way to the next stage of life. I also thought there was a strong sense of place with Arkansas, D.C., Italy, and New York. The writing was energetic and poetic and honest. And the chapter with Savion Glover was incredibly moving."
1,5 stars?? Paddock must have a lot of friends reviewing.,I'll just say that this story is too subtle for me to understand. Maybe someone could explain it to me if they figure it out. I know my Masters degree from NYU couldn't teach me to find a story where it doesn't exist.
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful novel about three girls who are friends in high school and then go their separate ways. But it is more than just a female friendship book. It is tragic and beautiful and an honest account of what it is like to be young and sad and hopeful for what your life could become. All in all, just an excellent read. I would love to read even more about these characters."
2,This book was not for me,"While reading Paddock's novel, I kept hoping it would get better. Sadly, it did not. Paddock began with a great premise for a story -- three girls brought together by a tragedy. However, poor narration, weak character development, and lack of actual story line made this book into the mess that it was. She tried to make the characters realistic, but was unable to develop them in a span of 15 years. She tried to intertwine three separate story lines in just over 200 pages, but wasn't able to do that either.I generally have a great appreciation for ""chick lit"" type books, but this was terrible. I didn't connect with the characters. The characters did not connect with each other. I think that Jennifer Paddock got lucky that her publisher liked this book, because I did not find much in this novel that would entice me to buy another one by her."
2,Didn't Do It For Me,"After seeing this book mentioned in several reviews for other books I had read, I was excited to read it. While it was easy to get through, it didn't have much else going for it. Bland, undeveloped characters, no plot to speak of, not to mention an event toward the beginning that supposedly ties these three characters together although they barely discuss it--sorry, but I just don't agree with the glowing reviews. After reading this and the relentless, excrutiatingly long The Time Traveler's Wife, both of which got rave reviews, I'm starting to wonder if I'll be able to pick out a truly good book again. I just bought The Kite Runner and The Memory of Running, so I'm cautiously optimistic."
5,Deceptively spare,"Paddock manages,with deceptive ecomomy to portray lifetimes, traumas and inner worlds. She keeps her prose unadorned so we can fully appreciate the realness of these characters. She is not a writer who is too precious or pleased with herself. This is a lovely and sad book and alot more complex than people will first realize."
2,I quickly lost interest in the book,"I had high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews, but it never engaged me. I found myself skimming through and even skipping pages, unable to relate to at least two of the characters. I found the stories of Leigh more interesting- she was the only one who seemed to have any depth. The other two characters were very shallow and self-centered. I also found the text murky- had to re-read certain lines several times to figure out what the author was trying to say. The way the book was written did not allow the reader (me, at least) to feel like the characters were realistic. I felt very removed and distant from them and didn't end up caring too much for them."
1,Don't bother!,"A Secret Word is a waste of time. It starts out with the 3 female characters being forever linked by the incident in the first chapter. Their lives are barely intertwined throughout the rest of the story. I waited for a big event to happen with the girls, but it never did. I stayed with it till the end. It wasn't worth the read!"
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews on this website and another, and based on that, I recommended this book for my book club. When I was finished with this book I was rather disappointed. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, it was at best ok???"
2,was let down,I had high hopes for this book but was let down. The story just didn't evolve into anything really satisfying for me. Evidentally (if you read back on reviews) I'm not the only one who feels this way.
5,National Book Award nominee . . . or should be!,"This novel should be sold as a companion to Julia Glass's National Book Award winner, THREE JUNES. Not that A SECRET WORD isn't original. It most certainly is, and it's as deftly written, with multiple main characters, storylines, and settings, and, yes, everything ties together. Everything! Though never in some cheap way. This is real life, folks. This novel builds just like real life, with story layered upon story. Or more accurately, this novel builds like an Olympic relay team runs in track and field, alternating between bursts of energy, graceful exchanges, and pure fire.I love this book!"
5,A MUST READ FOR YOUNG WOMEN,"Jennifer's book is an outstanding read for women of all ages. As a young college woman, this book was a great read and not only did it take me back to my childhood, it gave me something to look forward to in my future. I loved this book and plan on reading it over and over again. I have recommended it to all my girlfriends and those who have had the chance to read it all love it!"
3,genius wandering in the land of (con)fusion,"Gato plays wonderfully on this cd, but the fusion style arrangements are frustrating. His earlier works are so much more satisfying. ""El Pampero"" and the double cd ""Bolivia and Under Fire"" are good examples of his real genius."
1,Scam,"This current fad of trying to heal many health problems by wiping out a supposed ""Systemic Yeast Infection"" is a scam. It preys on those of us suffering from certain ailments. ""Systemic Yeast Infection"" is bunk.And this product is garbage. I took only two does a week ago (with charcoal, as they recommend) and I am still suffering the side effects: painful gas, horrible nausea, headache and fever. I don't know what is in it, but it's toxic. Boy, have I learned my lesson. Beware of what is being hawked over the internet."
4,"Great set, horrible mastering","This double set gives you exactly what you're looking for, in terms of music selection. The Shangri-Las were an amazing vocal group and there's a lot of stuff on here I've never heard before, nearly all of which ended up being great selections. The one big disappointing with this set is the horrible mastering job. All songs are EXTREMELY squashed, in terms of dynamic range, or ""compressed"" as we call it in the industry. Most people probably won't notice, but audiophiles may end up tearing their hair out."
3,Trio Saves the Day!,"A big time gangster in Hong Kong is wanted by the police for weapon smuggling, and the clues lead to death and destruction. At the same time there is a disagreement between two inspectors within the police force on how to approach the case. Inspector Chan wants to get someone young inside the crime syndicate that does appear or behave as a police officer. This is when he stumbles across Match, Alien and Jack who are three rejects from the police academy. The trio approaches the syndicate and somehow gets into something very big where the Japanese Yakuza is involved. Gen-X Cops is an entertaining film that produces some laughs and thrills, but not more."
4,big budget movie from Jackie Chan!!!,"really, this is what Mod Squad aimed for!rebellious/punk police cadets Jack (Nicholas Tse), Match (Stephen Fung), and Alien (Sam Lee) are recruited by somewhat retarded cop Eric Tsang to go undercover as gangstaz. helping them is Y2K (Grace Yip), a teenybopper hacker who's their eyes and ears and whose bro was killed by Akatora. Hopefully, these brash kids will be able to take down vicious punk Daniel Daniel Wu), who's connected to evil arms dealer Akatora (Toru Nakamura).does the plot seem whack and out of this world?? thankfully, Benny Chan is the director so you know you can expect a lot of fun/actions. Stephen Fung speaks english really well. And Nicholas Tse was very good in this movie.Not as good as in Y&D;Prequel but he had his moments. Sam lee is just hilarious as Alien.So despite of all the flaws and trying to be like an hollywood blockbuster, Gen-X-cops does meet your satisfactions"
2,Disappointing,"Gen x cops was recommended to me from a Hong Kong news group. but - Sorry, didnt like it too well. I wanted a tight, well directed movie. Nope - the direction is sloppy. As well as the writing and acting. ON the plus side, There is a large cast and some of the locations and shots are nice. But I was bored every other minute. The fight scenes are unconvincing. Most of the actors vary from over the top to out of character. The whole thing looks slapped together. Maybe tighter editing would have helped. If this is the best HK has to offer - sheesh!Is this the same director who did rumble in the bronx. - that was better, but sloppy too."
4,The next generation of Hong Kong films,"This Jackie Chan-produced film is a wonderfully entertaining taste of the next generation of Hong Kong films. This film has a very MTV feel to it, the way it fuses popular music, fashion and martial arts. The script is forgettable, but who cares. Even the fight scenes aren't as crisp as anything Chan would do, but, once again, who cares. This movie is meant to be a one-and-a-half hour daydream, and it works. Highly recommended!"
4,One of the better HK. movies.....,"Just saw the DVD yesterday....and it was a posetiv expirience......Nice action, ok plot, nice visuals,cool villan......need I say more....this is one of the better HK. movies.Concerning the DVD transfer; The 5.1. DD. is ok the vocals are sligthly blured, but the rest of the sounds are clear and crisp. The picture qualety is below average, I don't think this is a high definition transfer...sorry.But to summon it up; Great movie, but average DVD.eXistenZ"
5,"Comedy, laughters, and more",This movie is a great movie. It made me laugh so hard that my face just stayed screwed that way for some minutes. At first I mistook Toru Nakamura for Takeshi Sorimachi but hehehe...They both look nice...p^_^q. I love how Toru Nakamura's character is calm. And Daniel Wu looked adorable with that smile of his...
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I read the recommendations here and rented this movie the same night based on the positive reviews it received.Man, what a load of complete garbage this movie is!Don't get me wrong, I love John Woo's HK films like ""Hardboiled"" and especially ""The Killer"" and Jackie Chan is my all-time favorite action hero, but this movie has about zero percent charisma, charm, or interest level for me.I only give a single star because there were a few ok fight scenes, but overall, it's a dog with a capital D!"
5,Glad to find these - very pleased!,"My husband has worn ecco shoes of this style for many years. He paid full price for them, but the styles became less attractive over the years. I happened to be looking on Amazon one day and came across these at a bargain price. They look very similar to the first pair he had. The fit and wear are wonderful. We ordered 2 more pair to have for the future. We were fortunate that they had his size. We are very pleased!!"
4,High quality shoe with an identity crisis,"What purpose does this shoe serve?Is it a boot? No, you will have snow up your ankles if you wear them in deep snow.Is it a dress shoe? No, the THICK soles of these shoes are definitely for snow and ice.Is it a hybrid shoe? No, this shoe looks kind of hybrid, but the soles are so darn thick and it is unimistakeably a winter shoe.What is this shoe for? It is for those days where there is some snow or ice on the ground but not so much they come to your ankles. Ah ha! That's it. Come to think of it, that's how the weather is like in many Chicago winter days.These shoes provide GREAT traction. Even on solid ice, I can hardly ever slip on these shoes. Furthermore, they are MUCH lighter than my Ecco boots. The leather is so high quality, I hated wearing them during snowy days.I wear these during my frequent trips to Chicago and sometimes Champaign-Urbana. I have no reason whatsoever to wear these in my home in California."
5,Deep and Accessible,"What a rare treat! How often do you find a witty, significant and insightful text? I highly recommend this book to moms, dads and anyone else who struggles with the joys and challenges of raising kids. Reflect on your approaches and grow. Do it with insight and humor!"
4,if you like music now and were a kid in the 60's ...,"Then herb Albert was what you were exposed to.Guess I wasn't the only 6 year old listening to his parents copy of 'Going Places'! As a suburban kid in the 60's this was my first exposure to music, along with ""whipped Cream"" & ""lonely bull"" this was the stuff I listend to long before I had bought my first LP or 45.The Classic Herb Albert titles are being re-issues 2/8/05 so hang in there!"
5,Fond memories of a future musician!,"I can remember in the late 1960's playing outside in the snow with my sister and 'Going Places' was playing loudly on our small Hifi in the house! When I started playing the violin, I used to sit on the floor next to the speaker and play the songs. Little did I realize that this would start my career as a professional musician and music teacher. To this day I love harmonizing with any song I hear on the radio and I give the credit to Herb Alpert and the TJB!"
2,"Informative, but...","This biography is informative and I found the Introduction and first two chapters to be particularly well done. However, the author's writing fairly quickly becomes tedious. His style is flat, unengaging and repetitive. Once he has covered the initial case that brought notoriety to Murray O'Hair, the rest is just slogging through a sad and difficult life. For example, the time when Murray O'Hair was debating the evangelist Bob Harrington in the 70s should have made for fascinating reading, but the narrative here is disappointingly superficial.The tragic end to Madalyn Murray O'Hair's life is reported. There are lots of details, but that's it. It is tedious and Le Beau's sometimes excellent insights are overshadowed by uninspired prose."
2,Smells overpowering! Too strong. It makes people stare!,I used this about one time. I was so taken by the Jojoba line that I figured this would smell as nice. However it was totally disappointed. The cream makes your fingers soft but I myself can not stand the strong scent. It is overpowering. If feels like I sprayed on a gallon of perfume or something. The bag that came with this set was cheap- the gloves were okay- but of course you can find these anywhere. If you have never tried the La Source line I suggest you skip on this because it takes a special person to like this scent. All I can say is if you like smelling like a strong container of dried flowers this is for you. The smell of potpourri is great for the house but when you are wearing it - that's a little too much. GUYS will run!
1,Major Disappointment,"What a disappointment! This is a book based on the empty promise that the author is going to show some new way to solve the age old knitter's dilemma of yarn substitutions and how to make them. There is nothing new in this book; she solves yarn substitutions the way we all do and have been doing for a million years; swatch, swatch, swatch. This information is available from magazines, books, classes and other knitters!She does show examples of sweaters knitted in two different weights of yarn, and for the novice knitter I suppose this could be interesting, and possibly informative. However, for any knitter who has made even one successful yarn substitution, I feel this book is an expensive retelling of an old tale.I would strongly suggest that anyone thinking about purchasing this book first seek out a copy to look through."
1,Title is deceptive,"For years I've been trying to alter knitting patterns to accommodate different types, sizes of yarn. The only way I knew how to do this was by hours of experimental ""swatch"" knitting, comparing stitches, measuring, etc.So, when I saw the book ""Knit it Your Way: Change the Yarn to Suit Your Style"" advertised, I became very excited - at last, I thought, charts, explanations, a Method that would eliminate all that ""swatching.""When the book arrived I could hardly wait to start reading. I quickly realized the only ""Method"" that was mentioned was - you guessed it - ""swatching."" After a few pages talking about her experience with hours and hours of knitting swatches, the author then regales us with many photos of herself in self-knit clothing. It is not something that I would even pass along to a beginning knitter.The title of this book completely misrepresents its contents."
4,overview of the pre-history of egypt,"This book contains the history of archaeological expeditions relating to the pre-history of egypt. It contains details of numerous excavations in Egypt and Nubia and explains what was found, some illustrations of the artifacts and how they fit in with the pre-historical timeline of Egypt. Overall, If you are interested in the pre-history of Egypt according to excavations and combined research of prehistorians and archaeologists relating to this period, you should check this one out."
5,StarGate 101,"While watching the movie Stargate, I noticed the book, Egypt before the Pharaohs, that Daniel had in his possession. I thought that it just might be a prop but when I went to Amazon.com, there it was!if you are into Egyptology, especially before the Pharaohnic era, this is a must have book"
5,We Regret to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will be Killed. . .,"I have not read a more disturbing story. If you wish to learn more about the Rwandan genocide, I can't imagine a more extensive and real source. Please prepare yourself to read this. It is not for the faint-hearted. ""If you tremble at every injustice, then you are a comrade of mine."" -Che"
5,A Hand of Hope,"Lauraine Snelling knows grief--first-hand, gut-level, heart-wrenching but she does not dramatize it. She uses her experience and those of others to point to four practical ways to offer care and love to those who are grieving. I came away from the book uplifted and motivated to extend myself to others in their loss in a way that truly comforts. And I know what I will look for when I face grief in my own life. A must-read for every one of us."
3,it's ok...,"i had hoped for more as the release date was pushed back for months. but alas, i was disappointed. i guess i just expected more... if you have plenty of cash, it may be worth it, but if not, i'd say save your money... and i have no alternative purchasing options so... sorry."
4,"Great cast, but they get in the way of each other sometimes","I had never heard of this particular recording by Milt Jackson, even though I have CDs of his spanning the many eras of his career (including MJQ). But I happened to see this in the store,looked at the stellar cast listed on the back, and grabbed it.Overall, this recording does not disappoint. But,at times, the players seem to be getting into one another's way. It sounds rather ""muddy"" and cacophonous in these places. For example, the strings seem especially intrusive on the first two tracks. This is not one of Don Sebesky's better arranging efforts. What a difference it is without strings on ""People Make the World Go Round!"" I particularly liked Herbie Hancock's acoustic piano solo on this track.But the overall musicianship is, as one might expect, impeccable. I would recommend this for someone who has already listened to some of Milt's other recordings. But this is not the best place to start."
5,jazzman,"Yea, another CTI winner. You go, Bags. Loved this when I had the vinyl,and love it now. The track ""For Someone I Love"" NEVER ceases to put mein THAT mood. Serious, sophisticated, gorgeous. Listen to Herbie in themix getting into this and scatting. And those fantastic swirling stringsthat just carry you away on a cloud. I love the whole date. A classicCTI from the 70's with some of the best CTI stars at the time. Carter,Cobham, and Hubbard all kick in on this with Sebesky's perfect arrangingand conducting. I only wish some alternate takes could have been added.I won't quibble about SKJ being added. Any Bags is good Bags to my ears.A million stars."
4,Vintage CTI,"How anyone could badmouth CTI as a jazz label was always beyond me, and it's great that these classics are out there again. Freddie Hubbard, when he was at his best, was in the Dizzy-Clifford class--he could do absolutely anything that could be done on a trumpet. And he and Milt sound great together. I've always loved that sweet Stylistics tune ""People Make the World Go Round"" from when the original pop hit came out, and Milt and Freddie find all the beauty in it. Thanks for reissuing this beautiful record."
2,Classics should NOT be ABRIDGED,"The sound quality is very good. What is wrong is that the title cut, Sunflower, is only 8:51! This tune was over 10 minutes on all earlier versions of this CD, or vinyl, release! That's like having at 40 year anniversary version of IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA, but the title cut is only 10 minutes, instead of 17:05!!!! All music fans have their favourite songs that they would be sickened to see raped in this manner! YOU BE THE JUDGE OF WHERE THIS PRACTICE IS DOING TO MUSIC EVERYWHERE!!"
4,Great music - it will bring great memories,This is one of my favorite CD of all time. it has many of the good songs that made Guardabarrancon famous. I carry their music on my ipod.
5,"Breath taking, Dramatic, Depressive, but very impressive","Of all the films based on a Hardy novel, this one is absolutely the most dramatic. The camera shots are very good and the music makes this production even more sad. I really liked this film very much, because I'm a Hardy fan and this film is very close to the book, nevertheless the book is still better, but that is always the case with films based on a book."
3,Jude the Obscure,"This movie, as well as the book, was a real ""downer"". No matter what this man did, he could not win. The women in the movie were most unattractive, and what man would have fallen so hard for either of them? I was very dissapointed in the actresses who were his wives - as one looked like a tramp, and the other like an old maid schoolteacher. The casting was awful! When he died, it was a relief - because now he was finally out of his misery. In several ways, it reminded me of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" only, he didn't kill his first ""love.""Of all the Hardy books I've read, this one was the most depressing, so the movie could have at least made realistic casting of beautiful women. Ugh. I purchased this item from Amazon, which never disappoints in packaging, timely shipping, etc."
1,Not Compatible,"The printer would not work with our Macintosh system. Thus I called Dell for assistance, and their staff (in India I might add) could not assist me because they knew nothing of Macintosh systems. Quite an unfortunate week and complete waste of my time."
5,birding binocular,"Compact, easy to focus binocular. It has a carrying case with strap so it can go to the woods easily. I look forward to using it almost daily from my sun porch and when I go birding this spring."
2,Not worth the money,"I""ve got 50 year's experience with good binoculars and wanted a knock-around, inexpensive pair that was waterproof, fit in my pocket like these clamshells, and had good optics (obviously). I've generally used Nikon and Bushnells, so I started with those. While these Nikons are light, and well designed, the optics are not good. The binoculars were out of alighment and gave me headaches. I finally decided on Vortex Typhoons - which are a GREAT binocular for the money. I was amazed at the quality of the Vortex over the Nikons and Bushnells."
2,"low quality look, greasy","I bought it for the big name (Nikon) and many good reviews, as well as it's raking. When I got it, however, the lenses were covered by excessive liquid (water? oil?), and it does not let me feel that I have named brand product in hands. After looking at it and looking through it for a couple of days, I decided to return it, and bought the Nikon Action instead, which is larger, heavier, but provides much better view, focus and practical uses. Now I'm using it primarily for yard bird and animal watching."
3,The last of my OMD albums,"Back in the day, this was the last of my OMD albums. I thought they were becoming too ""pop-ish"" as they progressed in years. But Women III is one of my all time OMD favorites. Especially when I saw them perform this live with the horn section dancing in the background. If you really want to hear what I feel is raw, moody and idiosyncratic OMD, try their first 3 releases: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Organisation and Architecture & Morality. They were playing tracks from these albums (like Electricity & Enola Gay)in the clubs way before Crush was released."
3,Interesting Accounts of the War Through Their Eyes,"Solid storylines and effective narration. One account, however, duplicates another video called 'Vietnam Home Movies - Story of Bob Powell and the Gunslingers'"
4,Very good,"The book is very good, well written and easy to understand. I am very happy to have it. I suggest to buy it"
2,Way too many mistakes,"The concept of the book is good. The content is comprehensive, and Popov does seem to have made an effort to write the book for students. However, the book has just too many errors and typos! A page reference is missing from the Table of Contents, for example. The chapter entitled ""Yield and Fructure Criteria,"" misspelling ""Fracture"" as ""Fructure"" in big letters, really annoyed me. This book would be near perfect if not for all the errors. I bought the book as a reference but returned it a week later after coming across the mistakes. The book is just edited very, very sloppily. A third edition with these mistakes remedied would be great, but Popov is old and I don't see him doing a 3rd edition. That's a pity."
1,horrible guide,"I bought this book based on the fact that both authors had lived/traveled in the region for many years. I just came back from a trip to Bulgaria and this book was just horrible. In most parts(I haven't read the whole book) they describe towns as a mere array of buildings with their histories and how unworthy a visit they are. Practical information is useless(even taking into account that bus/train schedules can change frequently, the book tells you next to nothing. The section on the Rila monastery for example states something like ""try to catch onwarding transportation from there"". Try to catch?? Have they been there at all?).I could go on and on but in short--Do NOT buy this book. This is not the first time a Rough guide has disappointed me, I gave it another try for nothing. Very disappointing and a waste of money."
4,Really useful!,"This book is really useful and gives you, along with the travel information, some history for each main city. According to my Bulgarian friend, the information in this book is really accurate, except for the bus line numbers...! The book even gives you the Cyrillic names of the city.If you plan to visit a lot of Bulgaria, it's a must!"
3,dissapointed,"This had the potential to be one of the best dvds ever. except for one little problem,...THE WORKOUT IS ONLY 7 MINUTES LONG! And apparently its like that on all of the dvds in this series. There is a bunch of extras on the dvds. All kinds of advice from Andrea Lin such as how to dress and good posture and what not. But when it comes down to it. This isnt really a workout video. I put it on last night ready to workout. Then after 7 minutes it was over. I sat there like a moron thinking that there was something wrong with my dvd. Then I read the back and it said 7 mins of workout! Who in Gods name would spend $20 on a 7 minute workout dvd?"
3,Needs Improvement,"I just bought this video recently after buying the GoGo Dancing with KT video. I am kinda disappointed in this one though. They only show you moves to ONE hip hop song. The moves they show you is for their routine they made up for that one song, but they don't break the moves down at all. All they do is tell you the name of the move, do it once really fast, and then move on to the next move..absolutly NO breakdown.I had to put it on slow motion to try to figure out what the hell they are doing and i still can't figure some of them out. Instructional videos should actually show you how to perform the moves not just show you what the moves are."
2,Disappionted I barely learned anything.,"I got this video to improve my dance style so I was really bummed to see that the video is just 6 hot girls dancing for 7 minutes each. Don't buy this if you want to learn new dance moves, however if you are into watching a group of girls dance for 20 minutes then go right ahead/"
3,Too expensive,I used to be a distributor for these machines 15 years ago. They are very good except you are paying a premium for the MLM (Multi level marketing)side of the business. Amazon has others for sale from 3rd parties for about $130 that use the same plates as these.
3,XL-15 Operations,"I really can't rate the XL-15 just yet, until I can obtain an ownersmanual. I recieved it from a friend without a manual so I don't know ifits working right or just blowing air. It doesn't seem to make any differencewhere I turn the settings. A few times it made snapping sparking sounds, but not lately.Can snyone help me or tell me where I can get a manual? I sure would appreciate it."
2,This item was too old,This item is too old and come with two broke ozone plates.It came with loose inside that two ozone plates or because of broke cause loose. They should check before shipment also made a loud noise for the fan.
2,Okay from a Haole point of view,"The author is definately Haole relating his story from a Haole point of view. It was interesting as a Hawaiian of blood and Hawaiian raised, to view the island, school system and local people though Haole eyes."
5,Important Book For Our Times,"I've read the book a few times and bought additional copies for several friends. The books offer's biblical facts showing where the modern day churches are back sliding. He does a great job showing how churches like Willow Creek and Saddleback water down the gospel and present the gospel incorrectly.The book was a huge help to me in exposing the false teaching's in a church that I used to attend. It also helped me choose a new church that is Biblically relevent.While not the primary purpose of the book, there's a section at the end of the book that is the best I've ever read discussing repentence."
2,This one's a big secret,"This uneventful and disposable record nevertheless has a permanent place in jazz history as the one record that NEVER seems to be included in the Wynton Marsalis discographies. Sorry, Wynton, here's the hard evidence that you once played fusion disco jazz with Stanley Clarke!"
5,Music that touches the soul.,"Jason and deMarco manage to move one's spirit with their latest release, ""Spirit Pop"". With the voices of angels, they sing of things spiritual rather than just Christian, and their songs cross over into the realm of the soul. Their music lifts the spirit and brings one closer to God in ways that words only, can't. If your looking for a new type of spiritual music, this is it, you can't go wrong."
5,New wave of music,"There is so much music 'out there' today that is popular music that leaves you feeling desperate or alone to say the least. With these guys voices, you feel the energy, and you have a sense of hope that good still exist in the world. This is a cross-over album for these artist, so the lyrics are obviously to reach the spiritual community as well as the pop music world, and I think they've done an amazing job. I can't wait for their next cd which will be totally mainstream. These guys are on their way...and their voices are amazing. They are a cross between the sexiest smooth, breathy male voices out there, with the power of Celine Dion."
1,Not what i had hoped for...,"I received this cd today and though their voices are wonderful, this album is a bit more like sunday morning praise music than ""pop"". It's just a bit too sappy for me, i hope these two continue to evolve and experiment, i think they have a potentially bright future!"
4,A CRY FOR EDUCATION and A LIFE OF STRUGGLES,"A Compelling Story to TellLoreena Mary Minaudo has a compelling story to tell. She has told it in two outstanding books, ""A CRY for EDUCATION"" and ""A LIFE of STRUGGLES.""It is the story of a young lady seeking to make the most of her life while struggling with cerebral palsy.Loreena's tremendous drive and determination, her unyielding perseverence, enabled her to attain a college degree and author two distinguished books.Both serve to make us more sensitive concerning those less fortunate than us in life.""A CRY for EDUCATION"" and ""A LIFE of STRUGGLES"" are absorbing and readable books with compelling messages for all of us.Robert Selwa Religion Editor The Macomb Daily Mount Clemens, Michigan March 3, 2000"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,"Lamp is pretty in the picture but in NO WAY worth the money paid. Poor quality, poor instructions. Glass globe sits crooked.Cheap metal. Too bad. I would have ordered more if they were nicer."
1,Wallchiere major disappointment,"This item is definitely NOT worth the price charged.....it's cheap tubular metal, and looks cheap. Actually, I'd ordered the Bronze color, received Black, going BACK. One star was given only because a rating was required."
4,Nice lamp but incorrect information,I think the lamp is great however you need to change the product info. This lamp does NOT have a 3 way switch. Either send me the correct switch or correct your mistake to a single on off switch.
4,A quality center pin reel that you don't need to take a loan out to afford,"The Okuma Star drag reel is a solid dependable center pin reel, that's affordable. It provides smooth reeling and casting and is great for hauling in fish that could eat a small child, with plenty of line capacity and a reliable drag that doesn't jump or jam. You may not get quite the engineering as you would with more expensive reels such as shimano's, but for the price it's hard to beat. If you have $300-$500 to drop on a reel that you intend to use for surf casting and big water gamefish this may not be the reel for you, but for relatively small water (Freshwater Lakes, Rivers and Ponds) and shore fishing this is definately a good choice."
5,Bought as a gift and they loved it!,I bought this for a gift so I don't know much about it but he was very happy with it.
5,Picnic Basket,"What a great to to foster pretend play!!! Add a blanket on the floor and you have a picnic in your family room! Food articles are very study and washable---even after the puppy claims one! Super for labeling, sequenced play, etc. Melissa and Doug did it again!"
3,Just Okay,"I think I like this toy more than my daughter because it looks so cute. She plays with it occasionally, but not for any length of time. More then anything she likes to carry the picnic basket around like a purse. I wouldn't buy another similar or necessarily recommend. There are more toys out there that would stimulate kids pretend play."
2,"Stop staring at me, Sandwich!","I read these wonderful reviews and thought to myself that my 2nd child should have at least 1 new toy that hasn't been handed down to him from his older brother.I bought this toy when my child was 6 months old. He is now 18 months old and still devoid of love for this toy. I had envisioned imaginary picnics together, laughing while pulling the soft toys in and out of the basket and maybe even a few private minutes to collect my thoughts while my child is occupied with said chocolate ice cream rattle. None of this was the case. I tried everything to get him interested in this toy but nothing has worked so far. He likes the squeaking watermelon but as other reviewers have noted, this is parent-powered alone.He plays with a lot of toys. Just.not.this.one."
4,Baby picnic basket,"Nice, colorful basket for small children to ""tuck away"" little things to tote around. The ""food"" items are eye catching and make for a perfect quiet time toy."
4,very cute love the sandwich,My son enjoys it but it's not his favorite. I held off making the purchase because the price seemed kinda high. I gave in because I really wanted the sandwich. Glad I bought it but wish it didn't cost so much.
5,great,love the toys give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
5,too cute!!!,This is SUCH a cute toy and my 1-year-old daughter LOVES the velcro sandwich pieces especially! She takes them apart over and over again.
4,Great Toy,"I had this on my 10-month daughter's Christmas list. We did receive it and it's wonderful. She loves to shake the ice cream cone and hear the jingling sound. I'm sure that when she gets older, she'll use this alongside theAlex Jr. I Can Cook Toy, which she also loves.The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the opening to the picnic basket. Once you have everything inside it, she finds it hard to get stuff out, but once her fine motor skills get better, I'm sure it'll be easier. A bigger basket would make things easier, though."
5,1 year old loves the sandwich!,"Gave this to my one year old for her birthday. She loves taking things out of the basket and putting them back in, and LOVES pulling apart the sandwich! When she gets a bit older and has a lay kitchen, this stuff will fit in nicely."
1,Driver troubles for windows 2000,This device would not install in Windows 2000. It does not come with a driver for windows 2000. It says that if you have service pack 4 installed it should just work. It lied.
1,BBBAADDD!!!,"I'm sorry if I'm discouraging anyone by saying this but THAT MOVIE WAS SOOO SICK! Who in their right mind makes a movie about beautiful people (Rachael leigh Cook) getting their faces cut off, for SATAN, of all people. Do we have any Rachael Leigh Cook fans out there, or do I stand alone. No offence, but if any Rachael fan liked a movie where she not only gets her life and soul stolen by Satan, but also gets strangled with a rope, gets HER BEAUTIFUL FACE CUT OFF, and gets possesed by the devil, is a little cracked,(no offence).Being the HUGE fan of Rachaels' that i am, I cried sooooooo much durring that movie. i just can't believe that someone would be MEAN enough to put RACHAEL LEIGH COOK in a position like that. I just think that that movie was VERY SICK!!!"
3,"OK, but not a keeper","18th Angel is a winner if your a fan of the Omen, however, the story definatly lacks depth. It's short run time comes as a blessing considering the obvious plot turns of the show. However, the overarching story is still pretty cool if you like theological horror. Watch it once for a laugh or just to get a conversation started."
1,HORRIBLE GOTHIC HORROR MOVIE,I capitalized the summary to keep attention toward this review over the other one. THE EIGHTEENTH ANGEL is a horribly tedious and boring Gothic horror yarn thats only good quality is Rachael Leigh Cook. I really hope now that her career is blossoming that this film doesn't come back to haunt her.
4,"Worth a Watch, but not up to par","Not up to par in what this film COULD be.Maximillian Schell totally makes this film.It's his malevolent presence that adds the tinge that takes this from a below average scare, to a nice supernatural piece.There are parts where the scare could be beefed up, but it feels like the studio who made this piece may have either intervened, or someone toned down what could have been a seriously excellent scare."
3,BEDEVILED,"In watching this okay thriller, I found myself wondering just how many different ways Satan is planning to come back to earth. This new one about the eighteen angels is one of the wackiest so far, coming supposedly from the Etruscan Book of the Dead. First of all, they get eighteen angels, but only need one? And then when 17 of them are burned to a crisp, what did the purpose serve?Writer David Seltzer must still harbor Satanic feelings, as he is the one who created Damien Thorpe in ""The Omen."" While that seventies film provided lots of chills and great actors, ""Angel"" gives us an undebatedly beautiul Rachael Lynn Cooke, a sturdy father in Christopher McDonald and an overacting Maximilian Schell, but it's all been done so much in the past, there's little suspense or thrills involved. Only Wendy Crewson's spiraling fall is disturbing and upsetting.David, if you're going to write more Satanic resurrections, try some more imagination, and maybe let the good guys win every once in a while."
3,"Not Universal, Mostly for Cameras","This is not a ""universal"" li-ion charger. Only supports certain models/brands mostly for cameras, directions are not so easy to read but could be worse. Props to Amazon for giving me a hassle free refund, and paying shipping both ways. Just don't take universal at face value like I did."
5,Dynamic and Full of Surprises,"If you prefered the Beatles' Abby Road to Rubber Soul, if you prefered the Police's Syncronicity to Reggatta de Blanc, you will enjoy this for the same reasons; tension and discord at the end of a great band's flight, making for a wildly dynamic album that's full of surprises. Previous albums wallowed in redundant, sloppy, sanctimonious goth sillyness and far too many cuts that were simply self-indulgent wastes of the listeners' time. In this Burning From the Inside, every cut is a master-stroke and no two are similar. It ranges from profound to wacky to haunting to beautiful (though I could apply more adjectives than would fit in this space). The likes of Bela Legosi and Passion of Lovers has been left behind here, though their punk asthetics are still present in earnest except that here, they are applied in strategic highlights rather than in a clumsy wash. Of the other Bauhaus albmus, I only bother with a few songs from each but from Burning...I relish every song."
3,It's okay,The sheets are thin. I was hoping for a more substantial product since it is for an in home hospital bed.
4,Hosp. sheets,"They are nice .. I bought the bed in the bag the first time for $59.00 and the sheets in that package is much nicer; also you get a thermal blanket in this set so I think this is what I will buy the next time since I like the feel for those sheets more..These sheets are nice though, I am spoiled from the other set."
4,Great book,"My 9 year old son, who is into war history writes this: I really liked the book because my favorite war history books are about WWII. The RAF gets 3 brand new spitfires and they have to scrammble into them, because German bombers are attacking. The characters were good, my favorite was Capt. Simms. There wasn't much fighting action, but it was still a good book."
4,Great book for the absolute basics,This a great book if you are new or learning and trying to grasp the basics.I picked up this book in order to brush up on the basics and it helped me grasp concepts that I did not previously understand.The way that it is written may seen child like at first but it gets the job done at helping you understand how the components work.This would make a great gift to any high school student and above interested in technology.
4,Great book on circuit board electronics.,"It has easy to follow diagrams and explanations. All of the parts are explained well. This book is designed to give you enough knowledge to design your own circuits. The information is presented in a logical way that builds your knowledge page by page. When you are ready to start building circuits you can reference what you learned to get parts. This means knowing or looking up in the book a PNP transistor and using the schematic diagram to order parts. I like to order from Jameco Electronics. If you need a PNP transistor punch it in the search box at the site and you will have lots of options. I am not writing this review to promote Jameco Electronics. I am writing this to help people with building projects and getting the most out of this book. , Ron"
4,getting started in electronics,This book went right along with another book purchased earlier for my son who is taking electrical engineering. This book was in good shape and saved me a lot of money buying from amazon.com rather than purchasing through the college book store.
3,"Check Out A Few ""Surprise Me"" Pages Before Ordering!","Forrest Mims uses a very unusual and unexpected style in his electonics books. You'll probably be surprised when you see that the text and the diagrams are hand-lettered and manually sketched, instead of being professionally typeset and drawn. I personally find this kind of book quite hard to read as compared to the normal engineering book format, especially if I need to scan through the pages rapidly. This particular book seems easier to use than some of his other books, which IMHO are so carelessly scrawled that they are almost unreadable. Of course your mileage may vary, but please check out a few ""surprise me"" pages and make sure that you know what to expect before you order this book."
3,Best used as a refresher outline of sorts,"Not to dimish alot of the fine points of the book. Simple writing, straightforward illustrations and down to earth examples. Only problem I had was that it's a do-or-die book i.e. the whole thing is pretty cumulative and each page building on the one before it. Terms and concepts are explained once and then you move on. If you don't fully understand the idea from what's written in the section, you're left ""up the creek without a paddle"" so to speak. The author lost me by Capacitators on page 32.But it would be great in conjuction with another book as a supplemental.-- Isaac Dayan"
4,nicely presented,"First, i was really surprised by the way this book is presented, is written : It's exactly as if you were reading the hand written course of your friend (or your own ! ).Second, explanations are clear even for me who's not a killer in electronics which, to me, is a good point.Third, i love the hand made drawings insides, very funny.It's a nice book, i recommanded it in the thesis i made for the end of my studies in applied research in electroacoustic and computer programming at the cnsmd of lyon.best point : it's clear !"
2,Still a Popular Hobbyist Item,"This is a reprint, with little change, of the popular Radio Shack ""how to do it"" manual by Mims. Still hand-printed and having less educational value than a good textbook, it is an inexpensive way to do a few things with electronics. Should you want to develop a deeper understanding, look for a copy of Electronics Technology Fundamentals by Robert T. Paynter and Toby Boydell, a very readable and complete book at considerably greater expense."
5,Excellent,I really like all of the drawings. This is a great resource that describes concepts clearly and provides illustrations that anyone can understand.
3,Good but outdated,The book was really pretty good. It gave a good explanation of a large number of electrical components. Some of the simple circuits it tells you how to build are a bit outdated. I could not get some of the components from Digikey or other component sources as they were obsolete. I would still recommend it for anyone wanting to learn electronics.
3,average,This book has 2 parts. the first part review the basics of electronics and all the components.This part is really well done and easy to understand. The second part shows 101 circuits to build or projects.Most of the projects didn't work and this was the main disappointment about the book.Plus I found mistakes in the schematics. So get the book for the theoretical part but not for the experimental part.
5,Great book,"This book is great. It covers almost everything from resistor to ICs. Everything about electronic is here. It is simple, but essential for learning electronic. I have read more than 5 times already. First time, There are a lot of pages that I have no idea what it is talking about, but after read it more and learn from other sources, I finally 100% understand everything on it. In short, very good for reference and learning."
2,Hard to read -- look at the Look Inside! link,"I'm not buying this. Look at the ""Look Inside!"" link. All of the text from cover to cover consists of chicken scratchings. I need a typewritten book, my eyes can't take that."
2,Not a good beginner's text.,"This book presents itself as a book intended for those uninitiated in electronics, and it gets off to a great start, describing static electricity and electrons and the like. But around page 20, things start to feel a bit muddy; the author begins to use terms without properly defining them, and the circuit schematics don't make a terrible lot of sense. He explains in a rapid-fire manner what resistors, capacitors, diodes, FETs, JFETs, and MOSFETs are, but he doesn't really explain WHY a lot of them are used. By page 50 I found myself completely lost and looking online for another book.However, this book would probably serve as a good review or reference to someone who is already knowledgable in electronics, so it's not a complete waste, and I doubt I'll get rid of it."
4,Beginner Knowledge - but fun,"I ordered this book as a getting started into hobby electronics and it does that. It starts at a very beginner level which might be the point, and doesn't get too heavily into any mathematics (which I think is good). Design isn't supposed to be sheets and sheets of equations... it's supposed to be having a general idea of what is going to happen, then mathematical refinement later. This book is a decent base to that ideal."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This movie was far better than I expected. It came as part of a package and was one of the last I watched not expecting good things.It begins with a homage to ""The Blues Brothers"" (one of my all time favorites) that is done extremely well.It then diverts into a story of a woman who's dream it is to restart women's sumo wrestling. They find the guy who was just out of prison to lead and train them.Of course they run afoul of the local mafia who then start their own women's sumo team (stacked with killer's - of course) and bet everything on the outcome.It's a light and silly piece of fluff that is perfect for when you're in the mood to let your mind be distracted like this. It's not anywhere near Oscar calliber, but for what it is, it's great."
2,Japanese attempt at mixing humor and eroticism - unsuccessfully,"I didn't find this one particularly funny or erotic, despite the presence of some very attractive women. The women sumo wrestling was just plain stupid, and the overall plot was mostly lame. I did enjoy the flashback scene of the two pretty women who at one time were lesbian lovers. But that one brief scene does NOT a great video make."
1,Is it me..?,"I bought this album because I am always interested in finding great new artists and music. I love Sarah McLachlan, Emm Gryner, Indigo Girls, Jem-- things along that line. So I thought I would love Courtney Jaye. But I just can't. I think it's terribly simplistic, predictable and unimaginable. I like her voice, but combined with the simple lyrics, unoriginal themes and repetitive tunes, I just have to turn her off after a couple songs. I tried to be open-minded (I even like some Kelly Clarkson and Natalie Imbruglia songs) but I don't hear the talent."
3,a typical album,"I rate the CD with 3 stars because it doesn't give me surprise.I can tell all the rest of the songs in the CD by listening the first 2 tracks. The music & recording are good, the singing is also beautiful, only the style is..... 70's...If you're over 40, you'll love it....."
5,"Finally, her talent has been discovered.","I've known Courtney on somewhat of a personal level ever since she was a waitress at Smith's Olde Bar here in Atlanta. She would perform in the open mic competitions and always did extremely well. I would always go to see her performances, because...well...face it...she's hot, and she can sing...WELL. And I had always wondered why no one in the biz had caught on to her before. Then she gets a meeting with L.A. Reid. He's so impressed that he offers her a deal on the spot. Now...to the record. Now, I'm not usually one for chicky alt-country-poppy music, but I do like this album. Very easy to listen to, even for someone like me who prefers heavier, guitar-driven rock & roll. ""Can't Behave"" is an obvious hit. It's easy to HEAR why the female audience will like her, and it's easy to HEAR (sexy voice) and SEE (the obvious) why the male audience will as well. She's doing this the right way, and L.A. Reid is behind her 100%, so expect big things from Ms. Jaye."
5,Buy it now!,"She is one of the most original voices in pop music right now. The album is sublime and beautiful. ""Hanalei Road"" will go down as one of my all time favorite songs."
4,Really Good,"You know how they say 'Never Judge A Book By It's Cover'? Well, I always do that. Not in LIFE, but when it comes to actual books, or magazines or CD's, I always do that. And that's why I bought Courtney Jaye's album. She looked interesting.Well, the album is actually really good - so I guess judging the CD by it's cover payed off. Her voice is good, her songs are good an she's a marketable artist. What's not to like?Standout songs include 'Lose My Head', 'Mental', 'Can You Sleep' and 'Cant Behave'."
3,"Good book about dressage, if you can only read one.","This is a very large book that would like the reader to believe that by reading it and following it they may become a Classical Rider. ""The truth is"" if only it were so easy. While the author is clearly a skilled rider and trainer, this book has too much (and too little) between its bindings. The list of suggested books at the end is excellent, and if the readers only have time to read only one book then this one gives a nice presentation about classical riding. However; if one does have the time to read additional books, the concepts presented are already fully explained and in better detail by the old Masters. While I appreciate her re-explaining old concepts from her perspective, I did not see any ""new"" ideas to elevate this book to ""great"" status. Her other work, Dressage: The Art of Classical Riding... Now there is a GREAT book."
3,Exotic Catchy Beats But Comes Up Short,"For serious prevayors of exotic world beat hybrids- this music is only half for you. There are a few eye-catching pieces on this album, my favorite right now being Ishtar's ""Comme Toi"" but the overly poppy and leaning toward sugary redunancy on some of the more minor pieces leaves more to be desired. Overall, for those not looking for a serious voyage and rather a short course journey- this is the ideal album. Progressive bellydance students may also find this album ideal material for choreography. A good conversational piece for your next placesetting for ten affair."
5,A Pet As The Perfect Listener,"'Conversations with My Old Dog' is a delightful quick read for anyone who either enjoys journaling or who contemplates life's problems - large or small. You needn't have had a pet to enjoy this book, but that would surely add meaning for you. The collection of topics in these conversational poems written to the author's dog, Lucy, range from old age to losing things. Subtle doses of humor will bring a smile to your face. Maybe pets really do have solutions to life's perplexities!"
4,conversations with my old dog,My friend liked it and sent on to a family member who just lost his dog. Some stories inspiring and relateable.
3,Micro Metric Tap & Die,"Parts arrived in good condition, lubed to prevent rusting. Unfortunately the parts are not marked as to thread pitch and diamter. They are numbered so you can match the tap and die together, but you have no idea which die is a 1mm 1.5."
2,tap and die joke,Pretty shabby tools. May come in handy if needed but not what I expected in terms of quality but I guess for the price can't expect too much...
5,Excellent for any gunsmith.,"My husband likes the tap and die set. It works great for working on guns. We are gunsmiths,and it works really great. Highly recommended."
1,Not Worth Your Money,Don't buy this. Not good for anything.This product has no directions how to use it and I tried to cut some threads and the reamer broke off inside. Worthless.
3,Decent,"These are pretty good safety glasses. They look good and are light and easy to wear for extended periods of time.I have had quite a few people ask me where I got them so they could get some. The tint on the lens is good for bright areas, but not too dark for not so bright areas.I cannot speak on the ""safety"" aspect yet. I have not had anything hit them yet (and I won't mind if nothing does).My only complaint is that the lens shows artifacts when you look directly at a light. There is a shadow image of the light slightly offset in your vision. This is why these only get three stars."
4,Sweet glasses at a cheap price,I took a chance on these glasses because I was looking to save some money on glasses that were gonna take a beating. I am glad I went with these. They are snug on your head but loosen up after a bit. They help to minimize the glare of the sun and they wrap around nicely so you get full coverage. The plastic looks some what cheap but actually works well. I am very happy with the price and quality of these glasses.
1,Junk,"Most uncomfortable safety glasses I have ever worn. These are pretty much worthless, DO NOT BUY! I bought them for shooting, they won't work for that or really anything else. As soon as you put them on you'll feel a hard edge plastic piece gouging into your head."
5,Very Excited to own a copy,"I've just preordered my copy of the film and I am brimming with excitement as I wait for the fateful release date. Reading the book was like contacting a long lost brother, and watching the film is like finally seeing him with my own two eyes. Can't Wait."
1,pretends to be history,"I just watched the episode on Montaillou, and I was not impressed at all. I'm a medieval historian, and while this episode gets the details essentially correct, it completely misses the big picture. Much of this episode is based on Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's book, which isn't very good. Moreover, one of their ""experts"" in fact wrote a NOVEL on Montaillou, probably based on Ladurie's book. Finally, I saw no indication that this episode relied on any inquisitorial files opened in 1998--it all came from Ladurie. So be careful with this series, and don't get too caught up in the ""Dark Ages"" mindset. No one who's versed in historical study would take this episode very seriously."
3,Take it with a grain of salt.,"While I realize it did take place, there's alot of fluff in it. But with PBS involved, that does not surprise me."
5,Nice packaging,"A quality product at a fair price, AND shipped fast. These are good heaters and I use two in my sump to keep my saltwater tankat temp. I would recommend this brand and this seller!"
4,Action is the word.,Good history and great action. The music is awesome. This movie was the reference of lots of action movies we see today.
4,Auspicious Western Debut for Chow Yun Fat,"Chow Yun Fat does not miss a beat in his American film debut. He has the same cool magnetism here that was on display in his Hong Kong films. ""The Replacement Killers"" plays like a homage to the Hong Kong action films with the benefit of having it's shining light in the leading role. The film that this most reminded me of was ""The Killer"" except here the character is nobler and is less ambiguous. It would appear that the makers of this film did not think Western audiences would accept a protagonist with gray areas. That quibble aside the film is slick hard-nosed entertainment. Mira Sorvino aquits herself well as Fat's unwitting sidekick. If this film serves a purpose it may attract interest in Fat's Hong Kong output."
4,Watch it for the great sound if nothing else!,"Good 5.1 sound. Too bad some of the more high budget movies don't give the quality of sound that this movie does. I enjoyed this movie. Contrary to the ""professional critics"", I thought the lead characters did a super job. And quess what folks, no steamy sexy scenes either. Can you believe it? Lots of action from start to finish, similar to Arnold's flicks. Sure everything is predictable. But the cinematography is great as are the action and shoot-em up scenes. I don't think I would buy this movie, but it certainly is worth renting, if action and good dolby digital is your bag. I hope to see more of this guy and gal. I kinda liked the fact that he didn't smile much, it was his character."
4,"""DON'T CONFUSE LUCK WITH SKILL""","Chow Yun-Fat's Hollywood debut is an unpretentious, pared-down thriller that grabs you by the throat and won't let go until burn-out. True, ""The Replacement Killers"" lacks the overgrown plot threads that strangle so many modern actioners, but it's a better movie for it. Chow Yun-Fat is awesome as the reluctant assassin-cum-avenger, and Mira Sorvino...well, what can I say? She's hot. Blessed with a killer soundtrack, a solid supporting cast and some of the best choreographed gunplay out there, ""The Replacement Killers"" is pure action-magic."
4,Dual guns blazing!,"A hip, slick action movie. In a time when action movies are all the same damn thing, this one stands out. The pairing of Chow-Yun Fat and Mira Sorvino worked extremely well, and the shootout sequences were perfect. I recommmend this flick to anyone who is a fan of gun-heavy action films."
4,Tons of action,"Awesome movie!Chow Yun Fat and Mira sorvino are the perfect macth,and team up to nail the bad guys.John woo is a legened in the making.If you want to see a bad a$$ movie with lots of action then you have got to buy The Replacment Killers."
4,THIS KICKS MAN!!!!,"True, while the film is short on original plot and character develoment, it's visual style is unmatched in any recent film. The action is dizzying, fast moving, and all crammed together in one big, bad, and loud 88 minutes. Don't miss it if you love shoot-em-ups!"
2,If Only Woo Directed The Whole Movie,"I wont belabor the point that has been made about how this was NOT the best intro of Chow Yun Fat to America, the point has been made in almost every other review. The movie is mediocre and filled with too many bullets and not any blood (on the good guys at least). And as far as director Fuqua pulling off some classic John Woo moments, that's because John Woo actually directed about 15 minutes of this film, which is really the best part of the film. That and the excellent soundtrack partially make up for the fact that the directing is actually scattershot(if you actually watch an older Woo movie you'll realize what good directing of action movies is all about) and in my opinion a rather lackluster performance by mia sorvino, but yes she is hot. The movie is definetly a rental or a late night HBO fest, but otherwise a sad waste of great talent."
1,This film is bad!,The scope of htis film was small. THe way the action was captured seemed cramped and constrained within the frame.Terrance Lam the producer came to my school once and talked about this film. He said that the original script was much better than the final draft. I believe him. The colors and look of the film was wonderful. But the action and plot are less than desireable.On top of that the whole story seemed rushed to me. I would sell my copy for less than I bought it for!
1,It sucks!,"I was thrilled when I heard that Chow Yun Fat would make his first American flick....I m biggest fan of Yun Fat. I rushed to theater to watch it. I found it very boring film. Yun Fat was not himself in this film, because of his lousy English. What more, Yun Fat's character in this film was so stiff. I was very disappointed to see him acting like this one."
2,Gross.,"I guess it was unfair of me to want to see some martial arts in this...but the gun play...well, I guess I'm just not a big fan of people intermittently firing guns and hiding behind walls. And naturally, since I have a vagina, it precludes me from thinking big explosions are something really cool. I was bored...disappointed with Mira Sorvino...whose chest was pathetically visible by leaving her sweater unnecessarily open, but was only beaten in patheticness by her acting."
2,.,"The only thing this lame action flick has going for it is the presence of Chow-Yun Fat. Chow-Yun Fat is cool, but the movie is quite bad. The action sequences are candy-coated, ultra-glossy, less violent, slow-motion-ridden versions of much, much, much better gunfighting sequences from Chow's Hong Kong films, and the plot is dull and underdeveloped. Mira Sorvino is utterly out of place and annoying everytime she comes onto the screen. I just: ""Ugh ... it's that annoying chick again."" She does a poor job with an already uncondonable character. Really disappointing stuff ... only Chow puts it at 2 stars. That boy has charisma."
5,Blu Ray extended cut review,"I am going through a process of upgrading my DVD collection to Blu-Ray but ONLY for those movies I would/will watch again.Replacement killers is one of them, I am a fan of Chow Yun Fat, and there is just no actor who is cooler than him, the opening scene of this movie rates as a classic, as Chow Yun Fat enters the night club, Antoine Fuqua's Music video background is obvious here.That said, the Blu-ray is excellent, the ""extended cut"" scenes are subtle extensions and add further depth to the scenes, only a big fan would probably even notice the additions from the original.so for me its a definite improvement over the standard DVD, if you already own the standard ""DVD extended cut"", the improvement is tiny if any a DTS soundtrack option would have been a welcome addition"
5,This movie keeps pulling me back -,"I have seen this movie about five times now (everytime it comes on HBO)+ I bought it. I can't put my finger on it - ok, the dialogue isn't the greatest, and yeah, some of the action is cheesy - maybe it's the chemistry of the two stars - I dunno - but I can't watch a lot of violence in movies and this one I could see over and over and - you get the picture!"
4,"Ciao, Baby!","Chow Yun-Fat, who made a career out of action packed Hong Kong violence flicks, takes a turn in his first American-made action adventure. The results are uneven but entertaining.Chow plays a contract killer who has an attack of conscience. Unable to target a child, he attempts to flee both his assignment and the men sent to kill him (and his target) with the help of Mira Sorvino, certified tough chick and passport counterfeiter.Chow is a bit too decent for an assassin. Sorvino plays her hard-edged role well (thanks in part no doubt to her North Jersey Italian roots), but she is too much the soft doe-eyed lovely to be absolutely convincing when she brandishes a Glock Nine-Millimeter.Still, it's a fun movie, full of action, color and movement. A bit cartoonish, as much of this genre is, THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is a fine way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday night."
4,GREAT ACTION MOVIE,This movie was great. Lots of action and cool gun fights. Any fan who loves action movies with lots of shooting. I thought the girl was very hot also. Not much to say about the plot. See it or even better BUY IT!!!!!!!
5,Entertaining Action,"Chow Yun-Fat makes this movie slick with his style, and Mira Srovino helps out by looking as hot as ever. A fun action flick driected by a refreshing driector, Antoine Fuqua."
3,chow yun fat is better with a gun,i got this on dvd and wow chow yun fat is great especaily in the last scene. if your a big chow yun fat fan see this but do not compare to tiger dragon. chow really plays a good assassin to wow. so if your a chow fan a action fan your just bore one day i say go for it.
4,It Grows On You,"After buying this video because of Chow Yun-Fat and watching it a number of times, I really think it is very good. The story could have been expanded to fill out the characters somewhat, but just as it is, you end up caring about John Lee (Chow) and Meg (Myra Sorvino).There are the typical gun and shooting scenes and car chases. But also, some interesting scenes in a Buhddist temple and a sound track that is very good.All in all, a movie that is just what you think it will be from the title and cast. An action picture in a sort of noir style."
3,"Mira's hot, Chow-Yun's not-so; call it ""Woo Lite.""","Like THE BIG HIT, this Americanization of John Woo's deliciously over-the-top Hong Kong shoot-em-ups gets the outrageous gunplay right but fumbles the emotional substrata. Chow-Yun Fat, in his first English-speaking role, is reduced to a sullen, Chuck Bronson-style cipher (compare to his swaggering, screw-you cop in HARD BOILED). On the other hand, Mira Sorvino's a delight as a two-fisted passport forger who refuses to be the typical kidnap-victim/cringe-in-the-corner action-movie femme; in every scene, she's tough, sarcastic, and resourceful, with attitude (and gun technique!) to burn."
2,"well if you say who cares about drama, it has cool gunfights","i wouldn't say that, the gunfights are weak and hollywooded up. see A Better Tomorrow 2 for a real gunfight. this movie has more squibs going off on walls and windows than people. antoine did a miserable job trying to make chow yun fat act like sylvester stallone or clint eastwood. he's got more talent than this. but not to say every chow movie has to be like a hong kong john woo movie, but it looks like thats what they were going for and they failed. see it on HBO, chow yun fat is the only reason to watch it even if they limit his acting skills bigtime. check The Killer out for a good chow movie."
1,More bullets than words,The minimal dialog and incredibly boring and predictable script in this movie is simply filler between the ridiculous number of gunfights. There is nothing clever or original here at all. Just one gunfight after another. The only worthy element of the movie is the cinematography.
1,Forgettable,"This is easily Woo's worst movie to date. The characters are two Dimensional and the acting was terrible. Mira Sorvino was irritating,to say the least and Chow-yun-fat acted like he had been lobotomised."
4,perfect intro to Chow Yun-fat,Although Europe and Asia knew him as a great action star the US hadn't really seen Chow Yun-fat at work. This is a great showcase for his skills as a actor although he doesn't say many lines.....it's what he doesn't say but does that will get your attention. I highly recommend this movie and I'm sure it will lead to you searching for more action from Chow Yun-fat.
4,terrific action flick,"Exceptionaly well directed. Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino work well together. Get it if you like a steady stream of action for that adrenalin rush.Expect more amazing things from director Antoine Fuqua in the future. He's capable with the gun-play as well as with the smoother, non-gunplay tender moments."
2,Denzel Washington Movie,I love Denzel Washington and have ALL his movies.This movie does not do him justice...I did not like it.
5,completely satisfied,The alfalfa seeds arrived within a reasonable amount of time. They have successfully sprouted on the first attempt. I'm a satisfied customer.
5,essential stuff !!!,"Maybe not as good as his ""Love Approach"" album, but still essential for your collection. If you take yourself seriously as a jazz/funk of the late 70's early 80's fan, buy this!!!."
4,A Tom Browne must have!,"Bought this cd for the song ""Lets dance"" which was a hard-to-find on cd. I could've cared less about the other songs, but it helped to have ""funkin for Jamaica"" as a bonus on this cd. Who wants to buy a cd with just one hit? This song reminded me of the days when I was just starting clubbing it bought back memories of what life and music used to be. Sound quality was good as well as price for import. My only downside was the liner notes(artist bio)were written in japanese."
1,I had problems with this product,"I would recommend caution with this product, just in case you are like me and have a reaction to it. I have a lot of trouble with reactions, so I cautiously took only a few grains of the powder the first time and immediately had some trouble breathing and felt ill. I waited several weeks to try it again and noted a similar reaction, although not as severe since I used less powder. If you have any concerns about reactions, don't take it. I am going to send it back, because although it may work well for others, something in it bothers me--I'm guessing it's the yeast. If they made this product without the yeast I woul try it again just to see if I could tolerate it.The oxygen drops were fine, but if you use the full dosage you may notice a slightly corrosive effect when you swallow it. Be sure to use the full amount of water suggested."
2,A book with good topic but written in broken English,"If you have never been in credit card business, and you have to start career there, the orientation of this book fits well. Of course, if you are already in the industry for at least 2 years, there is little in the book that can interest you much.But, at least the copy I bought, is loaded with grammar errors. Many sentences are not properly ended without a period. I felt somehow difficult to believe that this text can be used for group training."
2,not a very good dvd,"doesn't play like the real deal-looks like a dvd copy i purchase thru here long ago,never complain as it was not the full series.."
3,just okay,"I've worked with P90X and so this seems slow. It's better for beginner/intermediate training, or for days when I'm just not upto the P90X"
1,hmmmm,if you own the power 90 1-2 phase.. This is just the same on the weight workout only mixed up differently. Save your money..
5,snack size variety chips,"arrived promptly in time for Christmas, good selection of chips, came in a nice box, would order againg. no problems and were fresh"
2,All melted,"All melted and as they were tightly packed in a box all squashed so not recoverable. If you live in a hot place dont order these. Looks like I am not the only who had this problem, hard to tell who was at fault, were they melted before or during the transit?"
3,Hershey's Big Bag,"There are a lot of chocolates in this bag. In fact there was too many Whoppers. I recommend not ordering this item when hot temps are expected as all of the snacks were melted and deformed. They were still good, just harder to get them out of the individual wrappers."
1,melted candy - never again,melted candy + no return policy = never again ordering from jina lee.Fix this or lose your business on here jina. THANKS!
2,Hershey mini bars,"This obviously is a chocolate candy such as you might buy for Halloween treats. However, I ordered it in late spring and the weather throughout the country was unseasonably warm this year. The people that shipped it simply stuffed the bag in a box and mailed it to me in the 80 degree weather. Needless to say, when it arrived, there was not one piece of the candy in it's original shape. It was melted every which way and stuck to the wrappers. The Reese's peanut butter cups were flattened as though someone had sat on them so had to be pealed from both the stability sheet, the wrapper and the paper cup. The flavor was ok but each piece was a real challenge to eat. Doesn't anybody use their head when they are shipping such things? Where is that supervisor??? This should have been shipped with dry ice. Capeech????"
2,Melted candy - YUCK!,"How disappointing to get this and find a bag full of melted candy. I suppose it is still edible and can be passed out for Halloween, but I expected the quality to be better. And I know it didn't melt here because it is Michigan in October - it's cold!"
1,smooshed candy,These must have been melted in transit or before. All of them were misshapen and smooshed. They taste good though..just wouldn't want to pass them out for Halloween.
4,More Like It,There were alot in this bag and went over really well .I made a good choice with this one and maybe next year will buy it again.
4,AIDA CUEVAS: LA VERDADERA REINA DE LA CANCION RANCHERA.,"Aida Cuevas es la mejor cantante de ranchero que existe en todo el mundo. No hay nadie como ella. Aida Cuevas reune todas las características de toda una reina de la música mexicana, además de ser una persona muy fina y sencilla.

2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZz,HA! no the jokes arent what iam laughing at its the fact that this book was made by the same guy who did the wayside school books!? ya right.Well any way this little waste of time by mr.sachar does have its good points but these are few and far between I didnt like this book and iam not gonna say i did that would be a bigger lye than well come to think of it it would be the BIGGEST lye ever.So if you want to kill some time why dont you read this book I dunno why you would but its you choice not mine.
2,A disappointment,"I am utterly disappointed in this book. After reading the Wayside School books, I thought that all of Louis Sacahr's books would be fabulous, but this book was far from it. I don't understand how every other reviewer thinks that this book is great and why they gave the book either four or five stars. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a boring and non-exciting book.J.E.N."
1,Not so great,I really didn 't like this book. It made no sense at all. It was too easy to read and it was confusing. The jokes weren't funny and it was boring. I didn't enjoy this book. I recommend this book to someone who wants to be a comedian.
4,Dogs Don't Tell Jokes,Dogs Don't Tell JokesBy: Louis SacharReviewed by: J. LeePeriod: P.3This book is about a seventh grader named Gary Boone. He likes to tell joke
4,"""This is a pretty funny book,"" says Efrem.","Dogs Don't Tell Jokes is a good book. It is about a kid named Gary W. Boone he is not popular at all. Then he joins the talent show, because he thinks he will get more popular if he wins. I'm not going to tell you if he wins. It's for you to find out. If you want a funny book, get Dogs Don't Tell Jokes. Efrem - 5th grade"
4,Have Fun Being Hatted,"Dogs Don't Tell Jokes by Louis Sachar is a funny book about a kid named Gary Boon. Gary is never serious. It isn't untill Gary signes up for a school tallent show, and takes a bet from his parents and can't tell a joke for three weaks that he realizes every one hattes him,and so he has to try to make friends. so if you like funny books read this one."
4,"Well-balanced, layman's guide to science and faith.","Kitty Ferguson has taken on an enormous task, attempting to write an objective study of what place--if any--faith in a Judeo-Christian God has in a serious study of science. The book begins with a detailed analysis of epistemology and then sets up increasingly personal and interfering gods against other cosmologies to see where conflicts and inconsistencies crop up. She does such a good job, in fact, that her viewpoint is left quite debateable."
3,King Arthur finally returns--to fight Earth's alien invaders,"Fans of pure Arthurian legend may NOT enjoy this graphic novel, set around the year 3000. Arthur's evil sister has lead an alien force to take over the earth, and a young boy who happens to be named Tom Malory discovers and awakens King Arthur. They rescue Merlin, and with his help contact the reincarnated souls of the old Round Table, barely in time to save the planet from the domination of slimy green aliens. Arthur is made to seem rather stupid in this graphic novel, still retaining rather archaic speech, and in the end, the reader may be left wondering, did he EVER really understand he was fighting extra-terrestrials? Still, it is a FUN book, for those who do not always take Arthuriana seriously, and are in the mood to read of preposturous situations featuring the great king."
4,Good premise that trails off,"Instead of taking sides in the ongoing debate over the future of our society, this author points out some behavioral methods which have a commonality to all viewpoints in that they are beneficial approaches to any discipline. This is a very mature approach which is unfortunately diluted by his addiction to certain assumptions common to post-Renaissance liberalism in the industrial West, and thus to avoid contradictions he runs his logical ship aground in confusion. However, for the premise and deconstruction of social pretense toward polarized action alone this book is a magnificent introduction to a traditional and natural attribute of worldview: reverence."
4,"Fine, but not without a little point","Well, this Dresden boxwood chinrest arrived on time, it looks fine, came in a hard paper package, well protected, it's a very good product.One point. The site say it's a chinrest as good for a 3/4 violin as for a 4/4. I disagree. It seems more crafted for a 3/4 violin.Or, one should say ""It's too large for a 3/4 (not too high, ok?) and too small for a 4/4"".Certainly can be used by both 3/4 and 4/4.:o)"
5,Hidden in Silence,This was an excellent gift for my two catholic neices for Christmas. A great way to introduce young folks to the Sufferings of Jews during WW 2 and to understand why Christ will never forget his own people.
3,"Fair,","This is a sad story and I know someone who had lived thru this, but it was just okay in its story line."
2,A ruined true life event,"This film tells the story of a brave young Polish girl and the near death experiences she has protecting the jew's she is hiding up in the attic. It is s great story of bravery.However all said and done the acting is extremely bad, like sonething out of a 1950's film. Marrion Ross should have stayed in the yester year with Happy Days.The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.So although this film has good intentions the people who filmed in it should have paid more attention to detail and got decent actors in it and not made it look like a budget movie. Alot more care should be taken when depicting real life events."
3,Amazing Story,The movie is worth watching because of the story of courage and heroism it tells. It is not a well done movie though. They didn't do the small things that could have really enhanced and helped you feel the story. There are those who during desperate times sacrifice themselves for the better of others and there are those who will sacrifice others for just a little personal advantage. It is the human story.
3,A good addition to your library,"If you are interested in this history, this is a good addition to your library. Accuracy of course is always in question, but overall the movie is reflective and moving."
4,Good Movie,"This was a pretty good movie. I just wish it has shown more realistic scenes of the torture they victims endured. But this is good for younger viewers, or people who don't like graphic Holocaust scenes."
5,Okay,"I saw the movie on tv long ago, and my mom and dad enjoy watching it. I still haven't watched its, but will soon. It is a great movie about World War II and what the Jews people had to go through."
2,"Good premise, but weak.","If Korea was this bad, we would have lost. Ryan and Montana (or is it Willamette) have a constant sparring match, then seeing Vic Morrow (SGT Saunders of ""Combat!"" acting like a sickly coward, was a bit much. There is the unbalanced and cowardly Platoon Sergeant (Nemiah Persoff). Oh well, Korea was tough, but these guys would never have survived. A good idea for a story carried off in a mediocre manner."
5,Men in War,"Excellent,all the cast perform their parts well, great action sequences and some amazingly tense scenes.The film begins with the troops hiding in a large hollow ,surrounded by tall grass. Wrecked vehicles lie strewn across the area and only the sound of the wind can be heard.Probably the most climactic scenes I will ever see. This is one of my all time favourites."
2,men,"This story did not seem plausible in any aspect from beginning to end. Ryan did a good job of acting and Aldo was his usual bad-ass self. His part of the story was illogical, espcially driving the jeep in the middle of nowhere, to the same middle of nowhere the patrol was at. And there just happened to be a few Nips trailing them in the weeds--that seemed really stupid. The last part of the film was illogical for them to even attempt. Not that good of a story."
3,Robert Ryan and Aldo Ray classic,"If you like war movies with Aldo Ray and Robert Ryan, then you will like this one. It's a classic and entertaining. Can't watch it too much or too often though, but still good for when nothing good is on TV. Some exaggerated scenes but, what the heck, that's movies for you. Bought it at a good price so it went into my DVD library as a good choice to have."
4,"good, but...","The first 10 minutes of this movie are as good you can find in any war film of that time and since, and not a shot it fired. There are other fine parts where I found myself wishing that the whole film could be that good, but alas. The flaws come in scenes where decisions or logistics don't make sense, or lapses back to war film acting conventions. Robert Ryan is very good, as always. And Robert Keith does fine work as a catatonic old colonel who gradually recovers his senses as the story unfolds. Plus you will see a very young L.Q. Jones and Vic Morrow. It's worth watching but not a gem. Kind of a low-budget Pork Chop Hill."
4,stanley turrentine,wonderful jazz experience.....do invest!!!!! they want me to say more about this cd....here it comes....back in 1975 in central park.....stanley gave an awesome concert.....and just at the moment he gave the rendition of one of his greatest tune 'sugar' the lights in the park came on like the magic and wizardly of his music just came on to us music lovers.....and we all chanted 'go stanley'.
4,"Works great for cleaning battery posts, wire leads and terminals!","Great iron brush for cleaning specific points of interest of wires, especially 8 gauge and up, terminals, contacts and battery posts. Compact sleek design that gets the job done. Recommend it. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars, it's because the iron strands of the brush, gets easyly bent, but it can still work fine if you brush the oposite way, and it would still get the job done."
4,Review of The Schooner,"I found this book to be most interesting from the standpoint of differences between the development and rigging of schooners on different sides of the Atlantic. Mr. MacGregor has done a thorough job of scaling the wall of schooner development over the years and gives some fine details of various vessels. Artist conceptions, photos, facts and specs all make this book one of my favorites regarding the subject."
5,A real trip to the magic Land of Xanth,"At first glance, it may seem like a road map to Florida, but as you look closer you see that it is really your entry way into the magical land of Xanth.Players take on charactors from the story, including their fabulous magic talents, to travel around the land of Xanth to complete a series of quests. Complete with hazzards like the gap with it's fearsom dragon, the elemental regions, and the region of madness!"
2,I can relate - BUT not a book I kept,"More like 2 1/2 strars. I watched the Lifetime movies several years ago, which I might add is far better than the book. I think Shellie, one of the main characters was crushed beneath a dysfunctional family. I related to her well b/c of my own battle and struggle with a life long , deep seated ED. Frannie and Shellie's mother obcessed over the girls bein thin. Although she might of meant well, her plan backfired. If you are looking for a novel of eating disorders, this is not really a good one to opt for.I enjoyed the movie far better."
3,Hunger Point,"This is one of Jillian's fine young adult novels. Hunger Point was very well written and has great ideas put forth. Have you ever had a craving that you could never fill? This is how Shelly Hunter always felt. Frannie Hunter is Shelly's older sister and is the main character of Hunger Point by Jillian Medoff. Shelly has everything going for her. Shelly majored in law school and is practicing to become a lawyer. Frannie, on the other hand, does not know what she wants in life yet. Frannie and Shelly have a typical sister-sister bond. They dislike eachother most of times, but love eachother no matter what. Shelly's health and anorexia starts to turn bad, just as it is becoming her whole family's worries. Shelly is put into a rehab center at St. Mary's hospital for 6 weeks. After those 6 weeks are gone, Shelly discovers that she is able to live on her own now. Just as things are getting better, the worst of things step up to the plate."
4,I enjoyed it,"I'd definitely recommend this book. Though it's not a happy story, I enjoyed the writing and liked the main character, Frannie."
5,Very enjoyable!,"Although it started out kind of slow, once it got started, Hunger Point was hard to put it down. Frannie was such an intriguing and strong main character. She made the book human and real, and I felt that I could relate to many of the characters in some way or another. Medoff realistically depicts the struggles of an anorectic and overall, it was an amazing read!"
4,"Witty, Wise and Wonderful","I cannot believe this one is out of print already. Track down a used copy of Hunger Point, it will be worth your effort. Hunger Point is a very funny, engaging story, with many more layers than the usual single girl in search of life, love and career. Frannie Hunter the protagonist has always been overshadowed by her brilliant younger sister Shelly. Frannie had just moved back home and is working as a waitress in a local restaurant and is single, but Shelly has just been hospitalized for anorexia. As their family tries to cope with Shelly's crisis, Frannie tries to deal with her own issues, on top of what's happening to Shelly. Hunger Point can be funny and sad at the same time. It is a wonderful exploration of family relationships and of eating disorders. Frannie is a warm, personable character you will find yourself rooting for. Find yourself a copy and enjoy."
5,I Highly Recommend This Novel,"From beginning to end, I was so interested in these characters and their stories. They became very real to me. For me this book is sort of a snapshot in how it portrays what some people do (so often women in particular) in their search to find love, feel loved, and gain control in their lives. Each character was searching in their own way and I related to them all. The first time I read it I was overcome with sadness, the second time I was struck by the humor and warmth. I look forward to this author's next novel."
1,there's no point,This book was like a literary long march. I was bored and turned each page hoping vainly for better. Skip it.
1,hunger point,did not like this book it was much too graphic and a stupid story. Her book before this one was pretty good.
2,Meh,"I had a very hard time caring what happened to any of the characters. To me, none of them were very likable at all."
4,Good,"This was a pretty interesting and insightful book. It's funny and poignant at the same time. At times, it's hard to understand Frannie's reactions to her sister who is suffering from anorexia. But as the story develops, it can be seen that Frannie deeply loves her sister yet is envious of her at the same time. The writer draws readers into the story and I found myself tearing at the point where the sister died. From that point on, I thought that Frannie sort of morphed into her sister as she seeked to discover answers about her. That was kind of freaky.Nevertheless, Frannie managed to emerge from it a stronger person.Overall, I enjoyed the book :)!"
4,I couldn't put it down until I was through!!!,"Hunger Point was a really good book. I don't even like to read that much. I like it because the people weren't perfect and they knew it. It wasn't just about Shelly's eating disorder it was also about Frannie's too. I really liked it at the end after all those guys in Frannie's life that she had slept with,she finally found the one she really liked, personality and all. The only thing that I didn't like was all the cussing and carrying on. That wasn't necessary. But overall I think that it was really good."
4,A good read--well worth the effort in the end.,"""Part I"" of this book felt forced and contrived. I was rolling my eyes as I read through the cliches and corny phrases that real people do not actually use. Another annoying habit of the author is the unbelievable amount of cursing in this book--practically every character says the f-word every couple of pages! However, I felt that Part II of the book made up for the awkward beginning. Without giving the plot away, I will state that the author provides a unique perspective on anorexia--particularly with respect to how friends and families are touched by the individual sufferer. Some sections from the second-half are amazing and incredibly well-written. As I was reading, I felt that only someone who has intimately experienced disordered eating could express and convey such complicated issues, and my hunch was confirmed when I later read that Medoff herself once endured and then conquered her eating disorder."
1,Not for me,Found book very slow and a little depressing I read for enjoyment and relaxation Dont enjoy reading books of this sort Didn't finish book
4,Very good portrayal of how eating disorders affect families,"I am a psychologist who works with college students, and I felt that this book offered a fairly accurate portrayal of the devastating effects that an eating disorder can have on a family. In particular, Medoff does a nice job of communicating the hopelessness experienced by other family members. However, I found it difficult at times to fully empathize with the main character, Frannie--her excessively brash style had a tendency to rub me the wrong way, and other readers may feel the same. Despite this, I think that people who know someone with an eating disorder will both relate to and appreciate this book; recommended for that population in particular."
1,I do not recomment this kettle,"I love the color of the tea kettle. . .that is why I bought it. Within two weeks of owning it the mechanism that holds the whistle shut broke. Not because I was rough with it, but because it was cheap."
2,Great songs - bad production,I very much like the Police's music and the selection of songs on this album contains many great ones. The only problem is that this is the worst produced album I have ever heard. The songs sound like they're played through an AM radio with a 3-inch speaker. I have all of Sting's solo albums and the production is excellent. Not sure why this one is such a lemon.
3,"A good collection, but missing some key titles","Although this is a good collection of Police's songs, I regret not having spent the time to better review the playlist before purchasing it. Some standards are missing (So Lonely...), and I may very well end up buying a more exhaustive one."
3,Radio City???,"I was uptown at the Radio City ""sister"" concert. Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Dave Matthews, Bill Clinton, and others, made appearances at both shows. However, we were also blessed by Tom Waits, Trey Anastasio, Galactic, and others. Frankly, I am SHOCKED that there is not at least a CD from the Radio City concert. I mean, c'mon, its all for a good cause. Wouldn't a Radio City CD or DVD also raise some money to help??"
3,Good book,Good book on his personal methods on acting..some I agree with some I dont..Gives you a good look at his method if you want to go study with him..otherwise have not got a lot out of this book..
5,Casino Royale,"A great insight into the foundation of Bond's character. A sophisticated and complex hero, often lucky and too often relying on that luck, plying his trade in a more refined time. Bond is ruthless, selfish, thoughtful and suave all at once - and we love it!"
4,"fun, give you a different view of Bond than the movies","I had never really read any Fleming. I agree with Raymond Carver, that he writes about a figure most men would love to emulate. Dashing, mysterious, hard, YET very emotionally complicated. This latter aspect has never fully come thru in the movie makes of his books, does in hard copy. I have ordered more Fleming, as this is a very satisfying aspect not hitherto experienced in a Bond character!"
4,"Good read, movie tracks it generally","I would recommend this to anyone who has watched any of the James Bond movies and liked, or even disliked them. This first book is a window into the time during which the books and films were conceived and provides an insightful backdrop for appreciating the films. (semi-SPOILER) The eponymous movie with Daniel Craig follows much of the general plot but with some notable changes. The book grants insight into the subtle habits and thoughts of Bond, or at least the Bond in the age when the book was written."
3,A Lens to the Past,"For anyone who lived during the post WWII period, the cold war with the USSR, and the paranoia of all things communist, this story reminds us of the romantic conflict of the good vs evil context of those times. When I was younger, I did not like the characters. Forty years later, I have come to appreciate them."
3,Fleming's first Bond story lacks excitement,"Casino Royale was the first James Bond novel and it is an amazing work of literature, but it never really seems to capture the mind of the reader. In Fleming's other tales, there is action and excitement, and above all, a solid storyline. However, Casino Royale, while introducing us to Bond and letting us understand him, lacks a sturdy foundation and never really seems to reach quite the climax readers are used to. All in all, however, this story set the groundwork for the other great tales that followed and launched the James Bond empire, something we all should be thatnkful for."
5,Ian Fleming is grandtastic!,"Being an all time lover of any movie starring the double oh, I had never actually read any of the books. Finally deciding that it was about time to dive into the rich mind of Fleming I was finding myself reaching for any excuse to get back to reading once life had found some way to tear me away for a few precious moments of air above the surface. If you are a Bond lover, you can't call yourself a fan until you start with where the man got his debut."
2,Did't care for it.,Was unexciting I was not cought up into the book. Good think it was changed for the Movie.Some authors grab you some don't. Could be me but others do better
4,interesting,I was curious about how Bond was originally conceived in Flemings writings. It satisfied that curiousity. A quick read and in depth. Bond lovers are sure to enjoy.
3,Interesting contrast to the films,"This was very interesting to read. It's the first James Bond novel, and also the only one that was not made into a film as part of the James Bond franchise. (At least not yet. I understand the upcoming James Bond film is Casino Royale.) I'm not sure I like the character of James Bond very much in this, but he does have a lot more depth than in the movies. He's also more fallible. I love the cover art on this book, and love even more that the picture of the girl on the front matches the description of the girl in the book, instead of being unrelated glamorous-looking girl."
4,An impressive debut by Ian Fleming,"Fleming kicks off his series with a bang. Here he establishes his classic mix of exotic locales, beautiful women, and breathtaking action. The reader can really feel the tension in the casino during Bond's showdown with LeChiffre. In addition, the titles in the James Bond Classic Library series are inexpensive but very nice-looking hardcover volumes"
4,Bond Introduction,Very good intro to Bond and why he is the way he is about women. Lot's of action and a terrific story.
3,Not the Bond you expect...,"If you grew up on Bond movies, your recollection is of a fearless man of action, that doesn't count on luck - he relies on it supplementing his bold attitude.The original character as written by Flemming is not the movie superman. He is just a man, fear, prejudices, warts and all.The book isn't bad. But the movie version is so emblematic that the original character pales in comparison.Worth the read, but be advised..."
3,Good enough for what it is.,"Enjoyed it more than I expected; though there's hardly any depth, it's a decent diversion, and a VERY quick read. Its main success really is that of being very much a period piece - although the accompanying misogyny is both blatant and unapologetic - and there's surprisingly little ""action"" in this spy story. (In fact, the biggest surprise may have been Bond's gambling at the casino being one of the most fascinating parts of the book!) Though Ian Fleming does tend to describe far more of a scene than the reader really cares to know, this is balanced out by the book being VERY short and a VERY quick read.Can't say I feel the need to ever read another James Bond novel, but for a piece of popcorn fluff this wasn't too bad."
4,"Sleep well, my darling","Ian Fleming is such an underrated and underappreciated writer. His abilities to carry a narrative from beginning, to end, without making it seem boring, are fantastic. So often I read action/adventure/spy novels where the characters are like cardboard cutouts, with no depth. In this book, the James Bond that we meet is unlike the Bond we see in the movies. Fleming develops Bond's character and gives him a lot of range. The writing of the love scenes feels real, not tacky, and Fleming's action sequences give the right amount of tension without overloading the reader with one action sequence after another.It's truly an outstanding spy novel."
3,Decent,The end of this book kind of dragged. Otherwise it was pretty good. I plan on reading the next one.
4,"Great book, but lacked some insight.","I am a huge fan of James Bond, and I loved this book. Don't take the lack of five stars wrong, the book was beautifully written. However, I feel as though the book was almost rushed. The plot developed very quickly, and I would have liked to have seen more of James Bond's unique personality, and the inner conflict he seems to deal with. One would be wise to note that the book is different from the movie (which is my personal favorite movie of all time), though adheres to the basic outline, or I should say the movie adheres to the book's outline. Overall, great book. I've heard this was one of Fleming's worst, and that the series only gets better from here!"
4,Is Bond ready for an early assignment?,"The first of Ian Fleming's Bond books shows us the agent in his early work. We find Fleming's Bond to be a practical and capable individual, who is more confident in his own abilities and perceptions than what perhaps is warrented. The agent that emerges by novel's end is grim, resourceful and driven. The young James Bond is a far cry from the suave, imperturbable Sean Connery that we all came to admire. His vulnerability makes him more human, and his cold determination makes him less so. I enjoyed the novel and look forward to reading the next in the series."
4,Bond,"They say the book is always better than the movie. I usually agree, but in this case I'd say they're equal, but different. No high tech gadgets or fancy special effects here, but you get to see Bond as the author originally created, which makes this well worth the read."
4,The name is Bond,"I can't remember what made me pick up the first Ian Fleming novel and learn where the myth was born but since then, it has been impossible to put them down. I can heartily recommend the novel and ebook versions of all the books. Ian Fleming had a gift and his ability to suck you back into the age of the books is brilliant.Read the whole series and for that matter, get a copy of Sebastian Faulks' Devil May Care. He is the only author who has come close to matching the master."
3,Fleming's first Bond story lacks excitement,"Casino Royale was the first James Bond novel and it is an amazing work of literature, but it never really seems to capture the mind of the reader. In Fleming's other tales, there is action and excitement, and above all, a solid storyline. However, Casino Royale, while introducing us to Bond and letting us understand him, lacks a sturdy foundation and never really seems to reach quite the climax readers are used to. All in all, however, this story set the groundwork for the other great tales that followed and launched the James Bond empire, something we all should be thankful for."
4,Royale Indeed,"Years ago I was listening to a BBC World Service interview with Sir Kingsley Amis who was a close personal friend of Ian Fleming. Mr. Amis was asked, ""Which Bond book do you think is the best?""Giving the question a good long think, he replied, ""I think Casino Royale is the best because...as is so often the case for writers, their first published effort...is their best because the writer has enjoyed more time thinking about their book."" Or something like that.Sir Kingsley also pointed to the disastrous outcome of Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd, who was probably the first woman who Bond ever truely loved.At the end, Bond is talking with his boss and says, ""The b---- is dead."" What does that tell the reader about how James Bond will treat women in the future, as his career develops? I think it says enough to create the foundation of a credible, loyal, and notorious spy. Ian Fleming removed the element of domestic life."
4,a little dated,His Bentley only has 25 horsepower! Bond is pretty human in this first adventure and is the beneficiary of several 'deus ex machina' rescues.Flemming (through Bond) is also pretty cynical about the whole spy game. An interesting re-read some 50 years since I was a teenager! LOL
4,Interesting and Entertaining Reading,"This being the first of the Bond series (that I had never read), I was interested in checking it out-especially after seeing the recent film. This was a different Bond from the one I had been accustomed to-a little raw and undeveloped and a little too cocky for his own good. Newly promoted to 00 status, the killing part was still fresh to him. He still had not learned how to let his guard down a little when needed and then pick it back up. His relationship with Vesper marks an important development in his psyche that will affect his later dealings with women ""on the job"". Although different from the movie, the major points of the story are the same. The book was short but it was chock full of all the elements of a Bond novel. I enjoyed it."
3,Worth the read,I believe this was the first Bond novel and it was a good first book. They get much better but this is where it starts.
2,It's a pretty good James Bond novel...,"If you're a die-hard Bond fan I'm sure you'll enjoy Casino Royal. I don't like giving away ""spoilers"" but I will just say this book doesn't have as much action as some of the other Bond books. The gambling scenes are interesting, I didn't know how to play baccarat, and fleming explains some of the intracacies of the game before Bond engages in a great game against his antagonist Le Chiffre. If you have seen the movie, the book is not that similar, there are a few things that are the same, but there are also some neat little surprises in here. Be aware however, even though it's the first Bond novel, Casino Royal doesn't reveal anything about Bond's earlier career that you must know before reading the other novels. I wouldn't particularly recommend this novel, almost all the other Bond novels I've read are better."
2,Not a good start for Mr. Bond.,"Being someone who has seen a lot of James Bond movies, I picked up this book to see where it all started. And I have to say, I was dissapointed. The climax of the book took place right in the middle, and there was endless detail after detail after detail. And I know it was written back in 1953 and it was a different world back then, but I was shocked as to how politically incorrect it was. Spy fiction was not my thing in the first place, but I can honestly say that I'll be sticking to the movies for the forseeable future."
3,"OK,BUT FLEMINGS COULD OF DONE BETTER","It was good ,but had more detail than action,I also think it had a stupid last 30 pages. I suggest that you try and get it from a library ,but it's out of print. Not worth what I paid."
4,Still great.,"Most of this book ages pretty well. Yes, there's parts of it that are woefully offensive in a modern context, but the story still sizzles. The Craig film, which is great too, will make you appreciate it even more.I used to think of this as the ""slow"" book in the series. I've come to appreciate its asymmetrical pacing as I've re-read it over the years."
4,Nice. Simple. Kind of anachronic spirit about this novel that makes it cool.,"If you like Bond movies or simple, short and enjoyable espionage reading. It's pretty much OK :D. These words are just to fill space so amazon may publish this comment."
4,How it begins,"This may not be what fans of the Bond movies are looking for, the novel itself is great. A bit slow paced at times, however."
4,A different movie in my mind,"I decided to start with this to get a better perspective of the Bond character. This confirmed to me that as cast in the movie, he's between Sean Connery and Daniel Craig in looks and style. He suffers from PTSD, he's ""broken,"" based on his service during WWII and subsequent work in Her Majesty's Secret Service. He's more complex, more lost, than I knew. The story was very good because Fleming is a very good writer, but like ""Peanuts"" Lucy character with the football, Bond is Charlie Brown having the dream of kicking a field goal (having a real romance that survives) always snatched away. He's not a misogynist, but the victim of his work."
5,Casino Royale introduces the world to agent 007.,"Casino Royale introduces us to James Bond, among the most enduring and popular cultural icons of all time. After a KGB official known as Le Chiffre has misused Soviet funds, Bond is dispatched to break his bank at the bacarat table where Le Chiffre is attempting to rebuild his funds. SMERSH is already hunting Le Chiffre down, and this will hasten this powerful Soviet agent's demise, publicly humiliating him in the process. Intriguingly, this plot almost takes a backseat to the development of Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd, the very first Bond girl. Le Chiffre meets his fate with about seventy pahes of the novel remaining. Vesper's secret, and the effect it has on Bond, sets the tone for Bond's future relations with women, and helps to explain why he treats them as he does. This novel is riveting, and Ian Fleming creates an aura of danger and excitement even at a casino table. If you haven't yet read a Bond novel, this is the place to start."
4,Wonderful Gift for My Husband,My husband was thrilled to receive this first Bond book as a gift. He says it is extremely well-written and loves the simplicity of the cover art.
4,A Great Start to the Series,"This is obviously the first in the series. Bond is not a fleshed out character and Mr. Fleming seems almost to be feeling out what he wants to make him. Regardless, it is a very good spy novel. Having read later Bond novels, a few old friends appear, giving it that homey feel.There is what will become the mandatory formula: a beautiful woman, the coolness under fire, chase scene, entrapment and escape that make these novels all work so well. Fleming's writing is superior to most in this genre.There is a great sequence of events surrounding and involving a big-time game of baccarat. Having read prior reviews, I went to my Hoyle's before starting so I would knoe the rules. That is not necessary. The game is simple and Bond conveniently explains it to his beautiful cohort. The game is probably the highlight to the book.A very good stepping off to a great series. An excellent light read."
4,A bumpy start for Ian Fleming,"Ian Fleming does a fine job in this book. However, his first effort at defining our favorite British super sleuth doesn't have the right amount of bite that we later see in his consequent work."
3,LET's not be jaded,"THE WORD NIPPLE WAS TITILLATING IN THE 50's, and CR was our intro to the man who WILL B E 007, but he's not present here. That's okay, we know he's on the way. This is the baseline. Enjoy."
2,Who could of thought James Bond could be boring?,"I know some people like these books, but I am in no way a fan. Found it hard to read and SOOOO boring. I love the movies and love the character but the books simply didnt do it for me."
2,Note as Good as the Bond Movies,"This will be the only James Bond book that I read. I grew up on the movies. The book is a short, easy read. But it just does not measure up to the action packed movie."
2,couldn't get into it,"Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books."
2,Hated it,"I had some change in my pocket and I was passing a bookstore and decided to go in for a look. I had every intention of buying a book and when I saw a number of James Bond books in a row, I decided to buy Casino Royale as the reviews on the back were rather convincing. I read 2 chapters... I find it difficult to ...enjoy such a boring, pointless in some parts, story."
1,Casino Royale Review,"Casino Royale was the first of the bond books. It was strange compared to modern day Bond. It was strangely oddly old fashioned and really never had much action in it. It involved Bond going on an assignment which involved card games. He was trying to bankrupt a Russian Smersh agent. Smersh is a Russian spy killing agency if you didn't know. When Bond was succesful at winning it, one of his assistants, Vesper was captured. I'll let you find the ending for yourself. I would r ate this book as one star. it may be Bond, but it is to boring. It managed to make me get to sleep every night. It could bore anyone to death if they want to read the thrills of Bond. Help! I hate just thinking about it. I do NOT want to see the movie."
5,Richly Textured James Bond Novel and Period Piece,"This is not only Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel but one of his best. It is richly textured, well written, clearly defines the Bond character and has survived not only as good literature but as a great period piece of the 50s. It also gives us a glimpse of the often unseen smoke filled cocktailed night life found in Europe's plush casinos of that era. Clearly, James Bond is a worldly character that lives and breaths in this unseen world described by Ian Fleming in this novel. James Bond can easily adapt to any locale or situation, size it up and endure. He is both innovative and resourceful and he must rely on his talents and instincts to survive. This is a very good Bond novel."
5,Even though I saw the movie...,I greatly enjoyed this book. I was pleased that several important details were slightly different (probably mostly necessitated by the change of era and enemies for the movie).
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed this, but found it a little shallow. It's obviously just an introduction and not a very good stand-alone book. Not sure I'll read the next one. Maybe one day."
3,Maybe it was great when it was written...,...but now it's not really that great. The movie took the idea of the book and turned it into a fantastic movie; one of my all time favorites. But the book just doesn't really live up to the standards that we're used to from the movies.
3,"Good reading, but there are better ""bonds"".","This book will, most likely, hold your interest, but it is not the very best Bond, in my opinion. Willy"
3,Did not fall in love with Bond,"I ordered Casino Royale because I've wanted to read all of Fleming's Bond novels in order for a while. Casino Royale was a pretty big disappointment. This book is mediocre at best. I've read in lots of other reviews that the novels get better as you go along, and I certainly hope so. Bond in Royale is frustrating and infantile. Yes, he's a clever agent, but he very much has the mindset of a 15 year old boy, especially when it comes to women. I was also really shocked at how mysogynistic this novel was. Nothing in any of the movies had really prepared me for the extent to which Bond hates and is utterly confused by women. You have to start, somewhere, though, and I'll keep reading the series. I just sincerely hope it gets better than this one."
3,Natural piety,"This selection is divided into four sections: The Poets Life, Memorial Poems, Sonnets, Narrative Poems. It contains many of the greatest and most memorable lyrics of Wordsworth. It is a fine introduction to his work.Wordsworth is a poet whose connection with the natural world was cardinal to his poetry. One can feel often in his perception of the outdoor world, a soul enhanced by the very act of seeing. Much of this seeing was done in walking. And his famous definition of poetry as ' the overflow of powerful emotion recollected in tranquillity' hints that that powerful emotion came often through seeing and being in the natural world."
3,"good book, bad service","I ordered this book for my boyfriend's birthday thinking i was going to get a ""brand new"" book like it had said, but that was not the case. I recieved the book 3 weeks later, a week after his birthday, and had to spend an hour erasing notes that could be found on EVERY page. The bookmark was frayed and messy, the cover had marks on it, and each page had different notes and writing on it; that doesn't sound ""brand new"" to me. I wish the company would have been straight up about its condition to begin with. Overall though, the book was good, the service sucked."
2,"Great band, but come on, now...","Great band, responsible for several of the best albums of all time (Malice, Hair of the Dog, No Mean City, etc.), but this is for the most part a lazy, depressingly conventional late '70's hard rock album. The title track, ""Busted"" and ""Kentucky Fried Blues,"" are, however, fine representative Naz songs."
1,Not Great,"I bought this to supplement my other ultimate discs thinking it would be a nice addition cuz it cost more. Not so... when throwing for fun at the park everyone fights over the Discraft frisbee's and swears when they throw the Wham-o... It's not flat at all, or very round. when I put a heavy spin on it you can see it ""fwoomp-ing"" through the air. Yeah, sure I can throw it better than a Walmart frisbee but that's about it... I gave it to a friend who's just getting into throwing..."
1,Not for Ultimate,"The Discraft UltraStar 175 g is the official disc for the sport of Ultimate. You will pay less for that disc than this ""frisbee,"" and you will receive superior quality, durability, and ease of use. DO NOT BUY THIS FRISBEE."
4,love my frisbee,"wanted a heavy frisbee for ease of throwing and doesn't flail around in the wind, get it, you know you want one!"
2,Wham-Os lameness,"First, if you want a real disc buy a Ultra-Star 175G Ultimate Disc - Standard Colors. These are the real deal. They are the official disc for playing Ultimate.Second, don't support Wham-O whose lame trademark of ""frisbee"" prevents others from manufacturing what is generically a ""frisbee"" as a ""disc."" So lame. Its not like mr. tissue invented paper with which to blow your nose, however, mrs. frisbee's pie tins were the first ""frisbees."" spending money to buy this and protect it is super lame."
5,Wham-O Ultimate Frisbee Rocks!,"my kids play Ultimate & enjoy an afternoon of ""catch"" What's better than Fresbee? Amazon provided a great disc, delivery, price. & overall experience. thanks"
4,Essential Tramp,"Even as a 20+ year metalhead, I love this cd. Many different sounds emerge. From the cool vibe of 'Aint Nobody but Me' to the heavier sounding 'Sister Moonshine' with everything in between., this album brings back the fun of the 70's that only Supertramp could provide. They definately were one of the best alt/rock bands out in that decade and are sorely missed. Just good pop that stands the test of time. Must Have."
4,The light (yellow sleeve) album.,"Supertramp leaders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson compliment each other brilliantly on this album. As Rick in his style is too earthly and practical, Roger in his is too heavenly and dreamy. Together they strike up a balance in their music. ""Crisis? What Crisis?"" is a surprising sequel to their masterful ""Crime of the Century"", a heavy, subtle album which kept a very talented but often too over-the top Roger Hodgson in check. Towards the end of ""Crisis?"", Roger does go off a little too much and gets too mushy. Perhaps a rearrangement of the songs or another song added by Rick before its release would of helped this album. Nevertheless this is standard Supertramp with full orchestration--wonderful woodwind, stunning guitar and acoustic guitar playing, keyboards with imaginative organ work, with adequate base and fantastic percussion. The lyrics are imaginative and intelligent and the backup strings and choir create a dynamic effect."
2,"Two semi-classics, lots of dross from the wailing Supercats","I recently reacquired this album as a CD and am wondering what I ever saw in it when I was younger. Crisis! What Crisis! came out at a time when Supertramp seemed to be intent on singing all their songs in an even more irritating falsetto than usual and much of it is pretty inconsequential. That said, the album has more highs and lows than the grossly over-rated Crime of the Century, and two tracks in particular -- Soapbox Opera and Two of Us -- are worthy to be included in any compilation album. But if you want a classic Supertramp album, you'd better look to Even in the Quietest Moments."
3,Fair condition!!,CD was only in fair condition and it was not disclosed the cd came from a library so it was heavily used. CD did work ok.
3,So so,This contains the great song Ain't Nobody But Me (the reason I gave it three stars was for this tune alone) and then it does nothing else for me. Crime of The Century and Even in the Quietest Moments for the best that Supertramp has to offer.
5,Second of Four Classics,"""Crisis? What Crisis? is the second in a line of four, what I call, masterpieces from Supertramp. It's a work dominated by Roger Hodgson, who does vocals on seven of the ten songs.The remaster is crisp and clean, with songs such as ""Sister Moonshine,"" and ""The Meaning"" ringing sweet out to my ears.But what I want to mention is that this package finally contains the long lost lyrics to the album. In the past releases I owned, they were never included. I had to go out and find the actual ""Crisis? What Crisis?"" song book to get them. And to all you Supertramp fans out there....the lyrics on this remaster contain many mistakes. ""A Soapbox Opera"" was always hard to figure out, and the key lyric at the bridge is wrong. (The correct lyric is ""But rather than a reason, there's a smog in my head"") So all you Supertramp fans take note!"
5,"The ""underrated"" album","This album is just as strong as the ""BIG 3"" (Crime of the century, Even the quietest moments & Breakfast in America). In fact, It's my favourite! How can you not be hooked in by ""Easy does/Sister Moonshine?"" The rest of the album flows very well. There may be no big hits but that dosen't mean there isn't great tunes througout this cd. How ""Another man's woman"" or ""Lady"" didn't become hits is beyond me! Just get it. You won't regret it."
5,Second best Supertramp album,"I loved Supertramp for two albums, Crime of the Century is their best but Crisis? What Crisis? is right up there. I think the rest are garbage pop tunes that have nothing to offer. If you like Supertramp and you haven't heard this ablum do yourself a favour and try it, this one is so much better than Even in the Quietest Momest or Breakfast. I bought all of Supertramp's albums in my time but now only have Crime and Crisis in collection"
5,Every Bit As Good As Crime of the Century,"There is a perception out there that Supertramp took a step backward from Crime of the Century with the release of this album. I disagree. It is another 5 star classic. I put it right up there with Crime, and there are times I'll put this CD on first if I want a Supertramp fix.The vocals from Hodgson and Davies are top notch again. Not many bands can claim to have two high quality lead singers. The ""environmentally and spiritually conscious"" theme of the CD make this one especially relevant even today."
4,Bizarre....,A truly occult book containing some of the most bizarre drawings I have ever seen. Hallucinogenic Lovecraftian monsters with a perverse cartoonish touch (sort of like the Pink Floyd: The Wall animations). Definitely for the rare or strange art collector. Satanic creativity.
5,"Generic AND Specific, a great supplement...","The great thing about this module is that not only is it a great ending adventure, but it also offers some great hints on how to use the ideas presented inside to fit any campaign. The adventure itself is intruiging, but be warned, you should not let your players have ANY IDEA what is really going on. The opening chapter specifically tells you the methods on how to lie to your players, keep them in the dark, and basically pull the wool over their eyes. I'd highly reccommend this book to any DM who wants to bring his campaign to a close with a bang, because this module features non-stop action all the way to the Apocolypse of your game world."
5,A GREAT adventure!,"I am a DM for me and my friend's D&D 3E campaign, and when I used this book I saw a total difference in my players. It was a lot of fun first of all, to be able to make up so many lies to my players and actually have them believe me! The thing that REALLY got them, was that they destroyed the world. When I told them this, they started saying things like ""Oh well, atleast the rest of the world is safe. This poor place doesn't matter"" Than I told them they actually destroyed... the world!They were wide-eyed and started freaking out, it was funny. Before they were too impatient to solve a small puzzle with fire, but after we finished this whole adventure, they discovered the importance of puzzles and adventure. The book is a little overpriced, but it would be well worth it if money is no object."
3,Mission Impossible!,"Lalo Schifrin composed some brilliantly innovative soundtrack music in the 60's and 70's ....eg Dirty Harry,Bullitt,Mission Impossible and Enter the Dragon to name just a few!When CTI recently re-issued a batch of their greatest recordings I was optimistic that the combination of Lalo + that CTI sound would be a sure-fire winner. However, the disco vibe now makes much of this album sound a bit dated. All is not lost, however, because amongst the bonus tracks is a cool rendition of 'Tabu' which alone makes this CD worth buying![The best of this crop of CTI re-issues may well be Idris Muhammeds'Power of Soul'which includes the wonderful track 'Lorans Dance', which still sounds as fresh today as ever!]"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"This is one of those albums that should never have been made... likeEthel Merman Disco Album.Lalo Schifrin wrote some of the best music I ever heard. Like the classic (and out of print)The Dissection and Reconstruction of Music from the Past as Performed by the Inmates...and the beautifulPiano, Strings and Bossa Nova. He also wrote some classic film music likeBullittandMusic From Mission: Impossible (1966-1973 Television Series).So it was with a blind confidence that I bought this CD.But this is a horrible album where every song looks like an instrumental ""disco"" variation on THE LOVE BOAT theme. It has all of the 70's musical clichés you can think of. And this is not even great disco. I love disco. But this CD is trash.I do not believe Lalo Schifrin wrote this album and I keep the disc in hope that someday I'll see some light from the sky telling me this was a packaging mistake.As awful as awful can be."
1,AWFUL! Stay away!,"Lalo composed great soundtrack music for everything from 'Enter the Dragon' and 'Dirty Harry' to (of course) 'Mission Impossible.' He even made a number of commendable jazz records in the '60s. This is neither. Rather, it's a hopelessly dated collection of soulless disco garbage, lacking even one listenable moment. This is worse than watching the 'Love Boat' on acid, and by far the worst album ever released on the otherwise cool CTI label. Buy any Lalo record other than this."
5,Working perfectly,"This cable is a replacement to the Imation Link Wireless HD Audio/Video Extender I bought that broke within a month. While wireless is great, the price of this cable and the picture/audio quality I am getting is worth tucking a cord. I do not have the hiss in my audio that others have reported and the audio wire was 20"" long."
5,Fantastic Cable! Highly Recommended!,"The ""Cables To Go 25' Monitor Cable w/Audio Plugs"" is a seriously well made cable for connecting my HP laptop PC to my Sony 46"" HDTV. This is a thick cable with solid connectors. The 25' length allows me to be on the other end of my den and the integrated audio plug allows for the PC sound to come through my speaker setup.The cable works exactly like it should and was so very easy to connect!Highly Recommended!"
4,Great cable but a bit bulky,"This cable has a 24 inch audio jack so it can reach almost any audio out point on a pc OR laptop. The main body of the cable seems bulky, but may be necessary to carry quailty signal, I don't know."
5,Great Cable,"This is the perfect cable for hooking your PC up to a monitor. With the 25' length I didn't have to worry about placement, merely found a spot and hooked up. The audio portion works great too, makes life easier having one cable to hook both up."
4,Works fine,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop to a new 52"" LCD for things like sslide shows....works fine. One caveat...with one of my laptops, the audio plug did not reach the audio port on the PC ...a few inches short. It does reach on another laptop...with minimum slack. I'm a happy customer."
3,Sound cable is not shielded,There is a loud white noise when I connect the PC to the TV and operate on the desktop of the windows XP. The noise is reduced when I watch video in full screen though.
4,HD15 M/m Uxga Monitor Cable with 3.5MM Audio,"THIS ITEM IS GREAT IT HAS BOTH VISUAL AND SOUND TO CONNECT TO ANY NOTEBOOK OR PC. I USE IT TO CONNECT MY NOTEBOOK TO MY 40"" LCD."
2,Does not transfer video and audio well.,I think my title says it all. The video image and sound are super weak. The item is definitely obsolete.
4,Heavy duty cable,"The item works. The cable was more heavy duty than expected, though. Very thick and weighs a lot. Does the job as expected."
4,Almost perfect,"This cable is just what I needed for watching from our laptop to the tv. Great length to run around the backs of couches and livingroom stuff to where we need it. It Reproduces video great but the audio is a little noisy when going from dark to light screens. I guess they could have shielded the audio cable more. Overall, It is a good value for what you get. Better then going to an electronics store and paying twice as much."
1,did not work,"I am no expert but this cable did not work for me... I have a 2005 VIAO computer that is in amazing condition, I only use for school and bought this cord to try to connect with my sony flat panel LCD. The TV would not show PC connected, it is as if my computer was not attached. Just gonna cut my losses. Although I am open to any ideas or suggestions."
2,Audio cord too short!,"I had previously read a review about the audio portion of the connection being too short and indeed it is. Where the monitor cable connects to the back of the PC, it will not reach the audio/headphone output without an extension."
5,Great!,"Great product and worth every penny, I would defiantly reorder! And the quick ship was a big plus. A pleasure to do business with!"
4,Useful Product,"I bought this cable to connect my laptop to my TV. I barely use it, but however many times I have used it so far, I lie the quality of picture and sound. Easy to connect. Very good price and prompt delivery."
4,Excellent choice,"I purchased this product to connect my laptop to my new Sony LCD so I can watch Netflix movies from the computer to my new 52"". The cable worked great, and the price was excellent. No problems."
4,Really Big PC Monitor,"I bought this cable to allow the connection of my laptop to my big screen plasma TV (46 inches). We watch many shows on the major TV sites (NBC.com, ABC.com, etc) if we miss the original broadcasts, look for hotels, look at vacation sites and this is a great way to allow the whole family to view the screen. Cable is easy plug in with sound and is plenty long enough for easy movement of the laptop. Good value for a no brainer PC to TV setup."
3,Works Sometimes,"This cable worked well when hooked up to my 52"" Sony Bravia. Did not work at all when hooked up to my 42"" Sharpe."
5,Beware,"Just be prepared to play this one down to the nub. Its as infectious as TB. Everything works, every song becomes your favorite."
4,Groovy Swing/ Jazz Stuff,"Very cool album in a singular setting. It's completely different than the three previous recordings w/ the band. At the same time in 1981, it's way ahead of the swing revival that eventually got huge in the mid-90's. Slightly before ""Night and Day"" and around the same time that ""Stray Cats"" started to get huge. It is a nice rounded disc of covers from the 1940's era of jazz. It is not for the casual listener who expects ""Steppin' Out"" clones. Indeed with the brillant composer, it is for those who digs Swing and Joe Jackson creativity in general. Very tight and full of fun when ya get in the mood for it."
2,Never Really Swings,"I have to agree with Fan From Michigan. I'm listening to the final track of the album right now, and it hasn't kicked me in the gut. The group never really swings; it sounds about like a bunch of youngsters playing at swing for 12 tracks. My tastes are usually pretty pedestrian, but this is a little *too* pedestrian even for me. Jackson's voice, which works well for me elsewhere, sounds lightweight and thin here. Can't recommend it."
4,Intro to money for pre schoolers,Arthur has to figure out how he can buy what he wants and how to get the money. This is great for an intro to pre schoolers and money concepts.
5,Alicia de Larrocha's latest great recording,"The Spanish pianist Alicia de Larrocha has been celebrated for decades for her superb interpretations of keyboard works by the likes of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven (Recently she made her final concert appearances in North America; I had the pleasure of hearing her perform a Haydn piano concerto at New York City's Lincoln Center, accompanied by the New York Philharmonic several months ago.). She has also been noted for her enthusiastic support of Spanish composers such as Albeniz, de Falla and Granados. In her latest recording, she offers fine, lyrical performances of these Granados works for the piano, offering vibrant, atmospheric portraits of Spain tinged with Impressionism. Though she is forsaking North America as a venue for her concert appearances, this latest recording of hers still shows a remarkable artist at the height of her powers. Hopefully it will not be the last recording by one of the 20th Century's most gifted pianists."
5,Gates Belt Purchase,"I like the quality of gates power belts, but usually order them from a local dealer. This requires a trip to the dealer to place the order and another trip to the dealer a week later to pick up the belt. With Amazon, the price was the same and I placed the order on Saturday and received the belt in the mail on Monday."
3,Very specific technics that are given,"If you learn basic casting. This book is too difficult to understand. If you are already into surf fishing, you are in right track. But you need serious practice to master his technics."
2,Not much help,"I am not sure what the other reviewers found helpful about this book. There are pictures that are too dark to see well, and diagrams would have been much more useful. Had they used smaller margins the book could have been half the size. Watch a free video of how to cast on YouTube and you will do far better."
3,good book,"It kept me interested. If you beleive in after death, that we continue, then this book is a source of information."
3,Interesting Read,"I found all of the stories interesting, and hope that there is communication with deceased loved ones. I'm on the fence as to whether I believe them to be real or hallucinations as I have been told."
5,HELLO FROM HEAVEN,THIS IS A FIVE STAR BOOK. I was so impressed with it that I sent copys to thirteen friends and relatives of my daughter. She went on to the other side after fourteen months with cancer. She was forty two years old. There is not one doubt in my mind~~~she is FINE.!
2,Boring,"Thousands of cases of After Death Communication have been reported, even though each case is unique, the subject has been over-reported and the Guggenheims offer nothing new. Good book for someone who has not experienced or read much on the topic."
4,Helped me through a difficult time,This book is good to have on your shelf. You never know when you or a friend will need spritual comfort from the other side.
2,"The first two chapters are good, but then.......","""Hello from Heaven"" is too repetitive! After a while it seems as though I kept reading the same thing, over and over again, and just wasn't getting anywhere. The author makes very little discussion about the After Death Communications, and after a few of the interviews it gets incredibly boring."
2,Its ok,"It was a quick read, and I gave it to someone else after reading it. Thoughtful and poignantbut ok"
4,Hope For Heaven,Sheds important light on the possibilities of a connection between those who have died and those who are left behind.
5,Interesting!,"I bought this book and had some difficulty putting it down! It is very informative and often comforting. While some of the material is very sad, it's ultimate message is uplifting.If you have ever felt you were contacted by someone from the ""other side"", this book may validate your experience."
5,"Need to hear, see or feel the touch of a loved one after their passing?","How many of us need to feel, hear, and/ or see their loved one after their passing. We all will go through death some time or another in our lives. We all know how hard it is to get through the pain. Well, this book is a good reminder for you to know that we can feel, hear, or maybe see our loved one after their passing. It may be through the beautiful butterflies, or it may be your loved one's actual touch."
2,Not very usefull,"I was looking more for answers but what I got were ""ghost"" stories. Reminded me of a Readers Digest. I know this book will help give hope to those who have lost a loved one...but when you lose a loved one you are willing to believe anything. The book discusses all the different ways you can have an ADC (after death communication). Talks of how the ""spirits"" communicate to us using all of our senses; audible,visual,smell,etc...lots of short blurbs about peoples ""actual"" experiences.. No hard facts to go on just stories..."
3,Not The Best Book Out There,The most amazing thing about this book is that I paid $8.00 for it. There are other books available that are much more interesting and convincing.
2,found very few situations i could relate to,thought this book might encourage or help me to understand the passing of a loved one. i barely skimmed the pages. maybe i just wasn't ready to read it?
1,Boring,"Page after page, after page of the same old same old. Story after story of after death encounters from different people.The book could have been only one chapter and made a huge hit with me. It could have just said there were this amount of people that had ADC's and here are a just few of those encounters. Believe me a few would have been enough (I already believe).On the back of the book it states: ""comfort and emotional support for those who are bereaved"", among other false statements. I believe this book was an annoying, let down and a waste of both time and money, to the bereaved and everybody else.Don't waste your money buying this book. If you think you want to read it (you really don't), get it from the library. The book was a waste of money! It was so bad, I will not buy anything from these so called authors again.Also, the star ratings are misleading as 1 star means you hate it 2 stars means you don't like it. Therefore, it's getting stars for being disliked and hated."
1,Hogwash,"I wish this were true, but it's bunk. Grieving is a difficult business, and we should not try to pretend we're still in touch."
4,Interesting,"Although this book gets bogged down sometimes in explaining an account of an ADC (After Death Contact) after you have just read the account, it is very interesting. If you are open to such experiences, this book will bring you comfort in confirming that life goes on in other forms."
4,My experiences should be in this book,"My mother passed recently and let me tell you the ADC's I've experienced should be in this book .Me and my mother were and always will be close and I know she has communicated with me frombeyond but the stories of how she has contacted me will put goose bumps on your skin but notbecause it was scary , but because it defies what we humans only truly know aboutourselves, love and death ."
4,"Hello from Heaven, Book Review","My oldest son was killed 3 years ago in a car accident and I still find myself trying to understand where and what he's doing right at this moment. Our family has experienced what we think to be ADC with him and wanted more clarification about what we had experienced. The book was very helpful with it's examples of ADC and the wide variety of ADC's also helped in determining what we had experienced. I strongly recommend this book for anyone needing further explanation about what they think to be ADC in their own lives. We spoke to our church clergy early on about what we thought to be an ADC from our son but they didn't give it much creedance but now after reading this book, I am positive my son offered several instances of ADC and it brings me comfort knowing he's here, just in another presence than before."
1,Do Not Like,"I have been trying to find a cup holder like this but when I put it into the driver's side window, it popped right out when the window was put up. The description stated that it would not do this. I tried it several times thinking I had done something wrong. However, there aren't too many options to try. It did not work as stated it would. I sure thought I had solved my problem."
4,Works for a Toyota Camry,"Decent product. Have to be careful when you open and close the window as it occasionally comes off, but it does the job. I'm satisfied."
2,its okay,"Fits snug between the window and door, holds drinks fairly well but makes me nervous because the arms are so flexible, i put a large cup of water in it and every bump i went over made me sweat nervously cause it looked as if it would just open its arm and let go of the water making my day worse than usual. HOWEVER it has yet to do this, so i'm only dinging one star for making me scared to order a beverage,*edit/update*after my drink flopped out onto my lap a few times i decided to put a rubber band around it, this helped a lot with the issues of the arms opening while holding a beverage. however a little into a month of use one of the arms just plain old snapped off when i was getting off the freeway spilling hot coffee all over my brand new pants. so i removed my stars rating and gave it two ."
1,The picture I saw was very misleading!,"This product was very flimsy and by the original picture I saw before I ordered it, it looked alot different. I returned it and never got a credit! So that was a waste of 4$$. Oh well!"
1,Junk,"Flimsy ,doesn't stay put and it probably cost 30 cents to make. You can do better, wasn't worth returning the postage was more than the item."
1,Does not work!,"I recently bought this cup holder, but it does not fit in the window unless it is open. I tried in 2 different cars (Audi & Seat)"
3,"Okay, but..","While not perfect, this cupholder worked fairly well; but after only about 2 weeks, someone (the ""Not Me Guy"") knocked it off the door one day and it got lost somewhere during our travels. I couldn't find this same one, so I tried a cupholder with rigid rather than flexible plastic on the piece that goes in between the window and door panel. Alas, we never felt it was truly secure, and I ""lost"" that one purposely shortly after we bought it.I was glad to find this flexible one Amazon -- we'll just have to be more careful getting in and out of the car. Since the price is right, I shall buy a few extra in case the not-me guy comes around again."
1,Not so hot cup holder,"The hanger part isn't how it looks in the picture. The cup holder part is okay, but the hanger will NOT stay in the car door window slot. There were no instructions, so maybe I'm doing something wrong. It will stay for awhile, then eventually fall off. I bought this for my ""lighted car ash tray"" which isn't nearly as heavy as an 8 or 16 oz drink. Unless you can figure out how to make this stay, don't put a drink in it or you'll be in trouble when it falls off... especially of you're driving!"
4,cup holder,"works great, hasnt fallen out yet, fits in the window just like its supposed to. I took a piece of velco and stuck it to it to keep from flopping around."
4,California Blue,"This book is about a boy named John Rodgers who runs track and has a relationship with his father while having a crush on his biology teacher, Ms. Merril. Johns father works at the logging mill and doesnt have the time or patience to deal with John. Also,John loves catching butterflies around the logging mill and around the tons of sequia trees near the mill. One day, John finds an unusual blue butterfly and he discovers that it is a rare unknown he discovers that it is a rare unknown butterfly which signifys the discovery of an unknown species. The only problem is ecologists want to shut down the mill in hopes that the butterfly can live peacefully and flourish. I recommend this book to just about any age and it is a great book that is a quick and fun read."
5,Heather is a Brilliant Artist!!,"I hope more people get the opportunity to see Heather's work...these drawings are amazing, funny, weird, smart...and her films are equally brilliant!"
5,Nice quality,"I am very happy with the size and quality of this product, the price was a bonus. I didn't want or need large case, and this was perfect, with divisions that were useful to me. For such an inexpensive product it is well put together and finished."
4,"Four stars for the film, zero for the DVD itself...","I was so glad to hear that select Shaw Brothers kung-fu films were being released on DVD in the United States...until I got my copy of ""Have Sword, Will Travel"" and the disc started jittering near the end of the movie (specifically, during the scene in which Ku Feng prepares his gang of bandits to attack Ching Miao's caravan as it passes by the old temple). The sound remained intact, but the picture was jerky and unsteady, and--worst of all--it affected the first two or three minutes of the final fight scene. I sent the DVD back and got another copy, only to find that the same error existed in the same exact spot on the new disc.This has occurred on three different DVD players. Has anyone else gotten a defective copy of ""Have Sword, Will Travel""?"
1,Kermit Should Sue,"Do you like to make fun of Art Films? Then do I have a doozy for you. This Japanese ""Pink Film"" called ""Frog Song"" is an incomprehensible mess involving unfaithful boyfriends, a manga artist doubling as a hooker, the wife of the unfaithful boyfriend who runs around in a giant frog suit. There's sex, SM, hints of lesbianism, and for no apparent reason, a song and dance encore.With all the visual aesthetics of a college film project and some of the most un-arousing sex ever forced onto DVD, ""Frog Song"" would be a Mystery Science Theater natural if it was in English. It was over in just more than one hour and I felt like I had been trapped for the entire day. I can't even emphasize how awful this is...from the women fighting with bread-sticks to the creepy SM actors dancing with the frog suited characther in the finale, this is even worse than your hipster buddy's entire DVD library's worst moments compilation."
1,NOT FOR THE NEW KETTLE BELL USER!,You have to be experienced and quick to follow this dvd! He does NO explanations just jumps in. I was disappointed.
5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS WORKOUT!","Yes, I love this workout. It's HARD. An achievable, do-able, work-your-way into it sort of hard. You can pace yourself as a beginner, or you can go full out once you get stronger.Some of the other commentors have said stuff like: boring set and no fakey-smiley faces. So what? Are you here to be entertained, or are you here to work the flab off your chubby behind? I'm here to work, baby. Please, Bob - make more kettlebell DVDs!!!!"
4,Not bad...,"I wasn't crazy about the setting of the video, or the way Bob interacts with his one and only client (female, of course). It isn't an easy workout; which I did like. I had to stop to take a few breathers, and couldn't do everything. It has been a few years since I've worked with kettlebells, but Bob is pretty good about showing correct form. I do wish there were a few different exercises with the kettleball. Bob continually has you do 2 arm swings throughout the whole video. I did the video last night, woke up this morning and was a bit stiff. But as I am writing this, my whole body is sore. So, if you aren't really fit, or just want to change it up, might be worth a try."
4,Nice workout but not his toughest,"I'm new to kettlebells, having discovered them through Jillian Michael's Shred it with weights. This is a nice workout but I do have to say that Bob's Cardio Conditioning workout is more intense and uses many of the same kettlebell moves, only uses a dumbell instead. This will give you a good workout, don't get me wrong. I consider myself an advanced exerciser and it definitely got my heart pumping. But at no point did I feel like I wasn't sure I could do anymore, which I felt at times with the Cardio Conditioning one. I think perhaps the CC one is a little more fast paced. I think the Kettlebell Cardio Shred will have a place in my library, but not as one of my favorite ones so that is why I only gave it 4 stars."
1,was he always such a jerk?,"OMG! This dvd made me hate Bob! Was he always such a jerk? I thought he was supposed to be the good guy? I don't care for his rude comments tk the girl at all. His constant ""Just listen to me,""and his constant breaks for explanations just drive me crazy! That's why he has another person working with him, so he can explain without stopping the workout. Just horrible. The whole thing seemed like it was thrown together in 5 minutes."
3,Bob is bored,"I feel this is an effective cardio workout but Bob is bored. I don't find him inspiring at all. There is one point in the workout where he mocks poor Becky. ""Maybe try a kettle bell! Maybe try a kettlebell! Who'd have thought?"". I want to bean him with my kettle bell. The workout is repetitive and not fun. It is however thorough. I will rotate this in when I feel like putting up with his smugness. For enjoyable upbeat Instructors go with Patrick Goudeau, Paul Katami, Jackie Warner. Bob and Jillian should take lessons from them on how to motivate."
1,I expected a full kettlebell workout,"I was very disappointed in this workout DVD. We are new to kettlebell and expected a full kettlebell routine. In this DVD, the kettlebell moves are interspersed with pushups, high knees, lunges. I have tabata and other cardio interval workouts for those moves. The kettlebell moves are awkward and difficult to incorporate into a smooth routine.This DVD appears to be poorly produced - done on the cheap. I think the only reason this DVD sells is because of the name recognition.I returned this DVD to Amazon."
2,Not educational,Got this after reading about kettle bells. There is no real instruction on how to use bells. Just a coaching session with no real direction. If you need a motivator - this may be OK. I don't need motivation - just instruction. If you don't know what you are doing- this may not be for you.
4,Killer Workout!,"I think this is the first review on Amazon that I've ever written, despite ordering many workout videos over the last five years or so. The reason is that this workout is KILLER. I am a 31-year-old female, 5'8"" size 10, 172 lbs. I would say in pretty decent shape (but carrying extra weight). Today I did this workout for the first time and I wore a heart rate monitor that measures caloric expenditure as well. I burned 451 calories, which I feel is very impressive. I could not do the whole thing without taking a few short breaks. I am very glad I purchased this video.I gave it four stars as opposed to five because Bob actually forgets to do a set of exercises for the left side, after you do the right side. However, I would not let that deter you from purchasing this video - just pause and catch up. I think it will be really worth it. It really works your glutes, too. I am excited to see the results.Great job, Bob - thank you!"
4,Yeah,I love Jlo and even though her movies are mediocre this one is pretty good. I think the story line could have used some help in certain places but overall they both did a good job. The music is awesome. If you like Maid in Manhattan and How to lose a guy in 10 days...you'll like this.The good think about it is it's a calming movie. Its a way to calm down and relax.
3,A Chick Flick,"I sat though this movie and nearly went to sleep, my wife ended up buying this one! The plot(pretty thin) hits you in the first 5 minutes, it managed to keep me awake with its little twists and turns. The movie focuses on the wedding planner Maria (Jennifer Lopez), who falls in love with (Matthew McConaughey) who plays a doctor (strech) who happens to save her from being cleaned by a dumpster (I wish), After going out with him, she is wanting to jump his bones until she finds out that he is the groom in the wedding she is putting together.Through the movie, the characters search for what they see best for both of them, with funny results.You bet it's not an Oscar winner, but one that you can watch again and again especially if your wife buys it."
5,a charming confection,"Delicious dialogue, heartfelt characters, this movie is simple but charming and full of heart. I didn't expect to like it and found myself loving it. It's unexpectedly quirky and fun..."
4,A cute and touching movie,"I would never have seen this movie except for the fact that my daughter filmed a few scenes with Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Pollak and I wanted to see if any of her scenes actually made it to the film. Unfortunately, the main scene ended up on the cutting room floor and she is in a very brief scene at the beginning of the movie. But with that said, I was really surprised at the movie as I really didn't expect it to be good and cute but it was. It's not an academy award type movie but it's a good movie to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.The chemistry between Lopez and McConaughey was very good. However, I was very disappointed in the fact that Kevin Pollack was barely in the movie. He is a very talented actor."
3,Typical but entertaining.,"It is so rarely that an interesting, funny, for-all-ages romantic comedy comes along. Is The Wedding Planner any different from all those when-the-couple-start-out-hating-each-other-but-then-fall-in-love routined films? Not at all. However, this movie two attractive leads and enough gags (especially the scene were J-Lo's horse bolts through a forest) to entertain any willing audience. The film is pretty unrealistic even if it's premise is quite intriguing. It falls through so many traps and gets itself caught, and the film is over-long. Jennifer Lopez doesn't act too well in this film either, but Matthew McCoughaney is fantastic, and contributes a lot to the movie. All in all, its floppy fun that is bound to get a good audience, mostly for its attractive couple or the money-making premise."
1,Uninspired Chick Flick Yawner,"Bridgette Wilson does a convincing job playing a fussy, demanding, selfish bride. But J.Lo can't act--she's poorly cast as an Italian (and has a big caboose, too). Matthew McConaughey is a joke; his twangy accent makes him seem goofier than intellectual.""The Wedding Planner"" might appeal to women, but it's not for men. The typical wedding jokes and been-done-before romantic plotlines are worn-out, and this movie does nothing to refresh them. There are many obvious plot holes (a wedding planner with no social life, a doctor who never seem to busy himself with anything not to mention the occasional patient). The characters are shallow and stretched thin over a plot that is not emotionally engaging.This is a terrible movie. If your wife or girlfriend insists on watching it, demand a night out with the guys."
1,Unwatchable,"This movie is the one of the most formulaic movies I have ever seen. It basically takes the usual romantic comedy blueprint and follows it to a tee, not bothering to make any changes or distinguish itself in any way. Usually, in such movies, there is a certain chemistry between the leads. There is no such spark between McConaghey and Lopez. I have seen both of them do much better work than this piece of tripe. Steer clear."
1,Better use the DVD as a coaster,"This movie was garbage. Placing a well-mixed martini atop the DVD on your coffee table will provide far more entertainment than this movie, even if you are spending your evening completely alone. I'd like to say the script was terrible, but, to be honest, I don't think there was a script. Lopez and McConaughey, two people with at least some talent, never had a chance in this film. If I had to allow this movie one saving grace it would have to be Justin Chambers as the puppy-lovesick Mossimo, but even he was sadly underserved by this sadly underwritten script."
5,Sweet Romantic Comedy set in San Francisco,"Talk about the comedy of errors in bad timing when you meet the right one right before marrying someone else. When Mary Fiore meets a handsome supposed bachelor she is in shock when a few days later he and his fiancee are her new clients. She needs this account to make partner even though it may cost her a partner of other sorts. Great timing, lots of tears and laughter, and a typical but hilarious ending on the way to an altar. Always the bride's planner but this time... she just might get to be the bride."
4,An uplifting romantic comedy...,"Even though this movie is very predictable from the first 5 minutes, it still manages to keep you enthrawled with its little twists and turns. The storyline focuses on Maria (Jennifer Lopez), a very successful but lonely wedding planner, who falls in love with a doctor (Matthew McConaughey) who saves her from being hit by a runaway dumpster! After a date with him, she is high on life until she finds out that he is the groom in the current wedding she is planning! Throughout the movie, both characters search for what they see best for both of them, with heartwarming, and uplifting results! Again, not an Oscar winner, but one that you can watch again and again."
1,What a stinker!,"I love romantic comedies so I sat down to watch this one waiting to fall in love. Was I in for a disappointment!Jennifer Lopez is a terrible actress and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Matthew McConaughey (who is adorable in How to Lose a Guy). Further more the movie celebrates a guy who is about to be married flirting and drooling and making goo-goo eyes at a perfect stranger. And the ending! I won't give it away, let's just say that there are NO surprises here, you can see this one coming from a mile away!If you want to sit down with a blanket, some comfort food, and a great chick flick check out Bridget Jones, Return to Me, When Harry Met Sally or French Kiss."
1,Zzzzzz....!,"Somebody pass me a blanket. This movie bit the dust. Someone had the audacity to call this movie, ""charming,"" and ""light-hearted"". Puh-leeze. I was sooo disappointed when I rented this from BB, that I walked it over the same night and returned it. J.Lo disappoints in this one-majorly. She gets by on her looks and ""talent."" Will someone call a real actress to do a movie and tell JLo to stop making these airhead flicks? Nighty-night."
2,J Lo letz me down!,I onkly saw this causz of J lo herself!! the greatzest actress in the world!! and i was really disappoinyed. the movie is really stupid. i didn;'t like the wayz that the too lead people acted together. and i thought that the movie was two p[redouictable! stawy away!!....peace
3,What can I say .. ?,"Another movie chosen ""by the girls"" in the family for our family night movie. It was all right but not what I expected. It had its funny moments and the characters were fun to watch, but the plot kind of dragged and it was nice to see the closing credits."
2,At least I didn't spend money on this movie!,"Yes, I am one of those women who loves a good romantic comedy -- I've watched so many, and will watch so many more. But the key word here is GOOD romantic comedy. Sadly, this movie was not good. Matthew tried, J-Lo tried, heck, they all TRIED, but it was just too cheesy to save. Why was it necesary for J-low to mention the m&ms quote? As if this was some romantic thing he had mentioned before. He just likes the brown ones, and for a stupid reason. Let it go. This movie was so badly written it never stood a chance. J-Lo we loved you as Selena, Matthew, you did a great job in A Time To Kill, so what possesed you to make this movie? The world may never know. If you want to see a much better written romantic comedy that didn't receive nearly as much press, check out 'Just Write' starring Jeremy Pivon and the guy who played J-Lo's father, he did much better in this movie. Also check out 'Music from another room' very good."
3,Good movie,"We really liked this movie enough to buy it and watch it more than once. It's sweet, a feelgood movie."
3,VERY heart-warming romantic comedy,"The day I saw this movie, I was with my dad, his fiancée, and her daughter. We had originally planned to go bowling, but it was too crowded, so, we went to the movie theater instead. Anyway, in my opinion, THE WEDDING PLANNER is a VERY heart-warming romantic comedy. I thought that Mary (Jennifer Lopez) and Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) looked VERY beautiful in all their dressy clothing -- Especially their wedding dresses. This film REALLY touched my heart and made me feel good. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this smash hit to all you Jennifer Lopez or Matthew McConaughey fans who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to have a good time and be touched."
1,IT STINKS !!!!,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WITH MY FAMILY, THINKING THAT WE IT WILL BE FUNNY. I ONLY CAN SCREAM THIS: WHAT A DECEPTION !!!WHO TOLD JENNIFER LOPEZ THAT SHE CAN ACT ? THE DOCTOR MUST BE CRAZY TO EXCHANGE A BEAUTIFULL GIRL FOR LOPEZ. MAYBE HE WAS CRAZY, DRUNK OR .... DON'T EVEN RENT IT. LESS BUY IT, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY."
5,The wedding planner,Have watched this movie so many times and still enjoy it every time I watch it. It is a decent movie and has some funny parts in that all can relate to. Would definitely recommend it
2,Flopper,"Im sorry, but no. This movie was terrible. There was nothing interesting about this movie. Yes it was cute, but is that all Jenifer Lopez can do? I don't know why anyone likes Jenifer Lopez. Find a better script."
5,Crazy about the Wedding Planner,"I loved this movie! Timless and classic, this movie is the best chick flick ever! I can't get enough of Lopez's style, and Matthew M. is a winner as well. The ending was no surprise, but it still made me cry. Great for a girl's night in!"
2,Scripting planner?,"I will first off say I did enjoy the movie; I am used to switching my brain off when watching certain types of films; but for this one I had to go three notches lower than I knew existed.The main plot of the movie is fine, pristine; the sub-plot is what throws the whole thing off kilter. The sub-plot adds nothing to the story, and destroys the main character. While functioning in the sub-plot the main character personality becomes homely and stupid, in the main plot she is aggressive and controlling. It appears to be two characters and two stories combined without regard to their contradictions. In places it is actually so bad, the movie is forced to cut to another scene before the actors stop and stare into the camera.It's witty and somewhat funny but not much more."
1,Frustrated Customer,"I purchased the DVD, ""The Wedding Planner"" from Wichita-BuyBacks in June it arrived broken or cracked on the center hole. I have written three E-Mails concerning the problem. I have not received a response to my problem or complaint. I think that the DVD should be replaced and shipped to me at no cost. I am clearly frustrated, and feel taken advantage of my trust in doing business with a company over the internet. I feel a month is adequate time to have resolved the problem.I am not a negative person, and I feel bad for complaining. I expect to receive the service and good business that was promised."
3,A Nice Little Romantic Comedy,"Jennifer Lopez is a famous wedding cordinator who is a little off center in the love section of her life. Enter the charming Matthew McConaughey, who in turns saves her life from an oncoming trash can when Lopez gets her foot stuck in one of those pesky steam ventalators. This movie is one of the few decent romantic comedies out there. It is funny and the actors actually seemed to have a chemistry going on in the movie, this aspect really helped the movie flow. I would give it a look see. Think about watching it with someone special."
2,horrible movie,"the plot itself isn't bad it's just a rip off of adam sandler's wedding singer expect this time it's a wedding planner, and the horrible j lo is in it. Matthew sure is a cutie in this one though."
4,grows on you,"When i first rented The Wedding Planner from the video store, I thought it was absolutely the worst thing I ever watched. The second time I saw it i started liking it and then once they showed it on tv, i actually liked it. the only negative thing about the movie is jennifer's acting is quite flat and she has no chemistry whatsoever with matthew."
2,extremely boring...goes nowhere,"I expected much more from this film...the plot sounded good enough and I couldnt wait to see it, but unfortunately, the film literally put me to sleep...nothing seemed to happen and there was nowhere for the film to go, it was long, boring, and pointless...maybe with some better writers, it could have been good, because the plot seemed promising enough....Lopez gives a bland performance as usual and has absolutely no chemisrty with her co-star...dont even bother renting this one unless u need a cure for insomnia, cause I slept pretty well in the theater..."
1,"Horrible, Dull, Dimwitted","I thought I would watch this movie with my wife, who really wanted to see it. It was horrible. I was embarrassed for the actors in it. I had to leave the room; I couldn't finish watching this awful movie! I would have given it zero stars if I could have. It's that bad. Do not waste your time with this movie. It's terrible."
2,how many times have we seen this before?!!!!!,"Although it was obvious that they were trying to implement an original plot, this movie fell victim to the overworked cliches of a modern romantic comedy.Quite plainly, this movie was a cheap rip-off of the more successful (and more amusing) ""My Best Friend's Wedding"". The movie was bearable only because of its star-studded cast but even so the predictability of its weak plot dampened the capabilities of its actors. Romantic, maybe, but as comedy it offered nothing fresh, particularly amusing or memorable. Skip it..."
3,Funny film!,"I just saw this movie on DVD after almost 4 years of trying. It is so funny in most parts. Jennifer Lopez did probably more than a dozen movies during this time and this is a good venture into comedy. She is so funny on most of the scenes as she's trying to defend her wedding planner job. It's kind of sketchy later on as she can't decide if she wants to go with the man played by Matthew (can't spell his last name right) or that other goofy guy in the movie. The review says they're all too nice. But I think that no one wants to step on each other's toes and reveal something. Lopez is more of a dramatic actress, but this was a good first effort into comedy. There's a little dance scene reminiscent of what she did with Richard Gere in last year's Shall We Dance? She and Matthew don't connect well until an hour into the movie. And some dull sections should have been removed. It is a funny movie for its romantic lilt."
1,I tossed cookies in my popcorn,"Most possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. If only there were an option to give a film a negative rating. The character Mary is about as transparent as J-Hose awards show gowns... and it proves once and for all that she is as poor an actor as musician. Just pairing those words along side the Lopez name diminish the meaning of both. One thig I can say for the character Mary, an Itilian by the way, is that she had an uncanny ability to slip unto a latino accent with no warning whatsoever, or... could it be that Ms. lopez is unable to stay in character? I really feel sorry for Mr. McConaughy for being cast in such a loathsome excuse for a film. He did a spectacular job at creating some interest, but one man can't make up for a horrible script. If you plan on seeing/renting this film, do yourself a favor and pray that you are involved in a fatal accident while en-route to the theatre or rental shop."
5,Great movie!,"I LOVED this movie! At first it seems like it is going to be just another predictable ending, but several events come up that leave you worried that things may not end up how you might want them to. I can't wait to get a copy of this movie so I can watch it again! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cute movie."
3,This movie was pretty good,I really don't care for Jennifer Lopez. I mean the women is an okay actress. I don't think she makes great movies. I honestly never liked a Jennifer Lopez movie (Other then Selena). But this movie I liked. I think she did pretty good in the movie. It was a nice story line and the chemistry between her and Matthew was great. I really enjoyed the film. It was cute.
4,Story of Love,This movie offers a get date for a couple that wants to spend a night at home watching a movie.
5,An Awesome Romantic Comedy!!!,"I thought this had a really good love story, and had hilarious moments! Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey were perfect together. Lopez stars as Mary Fiore who is a wedding planner that doesn't have a love life, until she is saved from an accident by Dr. Steve Edison. Mary begins to fall in love with him, until she realizes that he is engaged to her biggest client. I highly recommend THE WEDDING PLANNER!!!"
2,"Boring, Corny and Predictable","This movie was not good. Not good at all. I even watched this movie a couple of times, just to give it another chance and both times regretted it. It seemed like both characters were trying too hard to act, the lines were corny as well as alot of the scenes. I think I would have liked this movie better if they had different actors for the main characters. Jennifer Lopez is a ok actress, the only movie I have really ever liked her in was Selena. Matthew McConaughey is an overrated actor, even though I think he is quite handsome he is seriously lacking in he acting skills department."
3,Your Average romatic comedy,"It was a decent movie...It had it's funny moments, but it also had places were it seemed to just drag on. But the commentary on the DVD was really good!"
3,How Hollywoodish!,"An easy to watch - no concentration needed movie that will allow you to pass time. Things would have been acceptably okay had it not been for the cheesy - predictable ending. I personally think it would have made a slight impact to the audience if Mary married Massimo & not Steve. There, just saving you your money in case you haven't seen it yet."
3,Barbie & Ken find true love in Shallowville,"This is the type of romantic comedy Hollywood loves - where the guy's sleeping with someone else when he meets Miss Right, and it's soooo cute and romantic to watch him dump his main squeeze for a new one, in the name of love! Against a backdrop of beautiful scenery, and interspersed with lavish wedding shots - how can you go wrong?The movie opens quite appropriately with a Barbie and Ken doll getting married, and never strays from that level of emotional sophistication. So if you're looking for a shallow love story with shallow characters who make and break very shallow relationships on a whim, this is the place to be!Definitely not the type of movie you hit ""pause"" for when you go to get a drink of water, but still sort of fun in a ""Barbie and Ken"" kind of way."
2,snore fest... but sorta cute,"the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because there were some cute moments. the plot was VERY predictible (but knew that going into the movie) but jennifer lopez did an ok job. with better writing it could've been a better comedy. there was some ""cute"" jokes and certain situations that would make you chuckle (statue scene) but ""the wedding planner"" mostly dragged on and on. even matthew mcconaughey's hunky presence could'nt save this boring, so-so, romantic comedy."
3,The Wedding was not Planned,"The Wedding is a typical comdey romance with nothing really to shout about. The preformances are O.K. and the script is like any others. When talking about just the movie the wedding was not planned. Althought the preformance of Justin Chambers portraing ""Massimo"" is the about only thing the movie has to show for it self. DVD features is one thing that saves the movie, the minute you here Jenifer Lopez ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" at the end credits, you'll want to to press the menu button right away. So if you have a DVD player go ahead and rent it, but if you saw it in theaters you wasted your time."
2,Ok,Sometimes funny and cute. But sometimes it comes on too strong -- trying too hard to be funny and cute. Not worth it.
3,It's a Jennifer Lopez staple,"What can I say about The Wedding Planner? It's predictable, it's upbeat, and true to Jennifer Lopez's predictible rom-coms - which fortunately, for this movie anyway, was a box offie hit. He (McConaghy) plays a pediatrician, she (Lopez) plays a wedding planner. The opening scene actually tells you right away who Lopez is as it takes place at a church, and she's reassuring the bride in a templ;ate script she recites to all brides. We don't know anything about the man (McCognahy) until he saves Lopez from a stuck manhole (stiletto yet!) and when Lopez awakens, she is in a child's bed and a child ready to maul her. There is a lot of back and forth, to and fro, and way to go...if you like a little chuckle even knowing the way this movie will end, see ""The Wedding Planner"" - a definite, a total, chick flick--not a chick fest, but a chick flick!Well Done!Purchased this DVD at amazon.com"
5,I LOVE JLO!!!,"This is Jennifer Lopez's best movie! It's so silly and fun, I can watch it over and over again! One of the best movies ever!"
1,SIMPLY INDESCRIBABLE...,"The first five minutes of the movie are great. It looks to be a sharp and sassy film. Then, the inevitable kicks in. Jennifer Lopez looks great, as does her supporting cast, but you can't get by on looks alone. Unfortunately, the entire cast is stuck with the screenplay from hell and a director who, apparently, was asleep at the wheel.Bad script, bad acting, bad chemistry, bad movie...'nuff said!"
5,One of my favorites....,Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey are perfect fits for the this movie. It's an all around feel good movie. It makes you imagine... Matthew is very sexy as Steve Eddison and J.Lo suites the part. Highly recommended!
5,Great Movie,The movie is great. Jennifer and Mathew are great actors. You're gonna laugh and cry at the same time. Buy it you're gonna like it.
5,Loved the movie!,I loved the movie and thought it was so cute!I had to get it for a relative in the family as well...
2,oh well,"I used this tarp to cover a tent like carport, ya know the type with tubular framewith it strapped down tightly by all it's eyelets, then ropes over it's top tied to bottom corners, the first night of wind before the storm ripped the eyelets out just as fast as the cheap blue tarps, maby no tarp is utah proof :("
5,HOOTIE ROCKS!,"I go to the Used CD store and I see about ten of these in the new arrivals everytime I go. This is a sad sight because this is one of the best southern rock albums ever. No CD collection should be without it and everyone is trying to get rid of it.Hootie is one of those bands that you know will never break up because they have so much fun with their music. The songs on CRV are great. They are mostly about relationships, love, and that how we should all get along. It's wonderful.Some of the best songs are ""Drowning,"" a song that speaks out against racism. ""Hold My Hand,"" one of those loveydub songs. Also, ""Only Want To Be With You."" (Loveydub.) But all the songs are great. That is why CRV gets *points to five shooting stars* FIVE STARS!!!"
3,Not worth owning the album,"Time,Only wanna be with you, Hold my hand, and (my personal fav)let her cry are all good(if overplayed) tunes.Of course, there not artists ot to blow your mind with 9 minute opuses of noise and feedback like Sonic Youth, that isn't to be expected when listening to such a commerical,pop album. But I at least expected the album tracks to be stronger.Instead they were quite bland. Also, the singles sound a dated after repeat listenings. It certaintly doesn't hold to repeat listenings such as Nirvana's Nevermind or any Beatles cd. The whole thing pretty much sounded like a more rock oriented Toad the Wet Sprocket.I guess if u want the singles u should but it though."
1,blowfish,hootie and the blowfish? what kind of name is that? this cd blows fish. hootie and the blowfish is a prank
1,This band blows...,"This band is everything wrong with radio in the USA. Insipid songs, bland playing... It shouldn't surprise me that 13 million people bought this crap but it does. 13 million frat boys can't be wrong right?"
1,Hootie and the Blowhards,"This is perhaps one of the worst albums ever produced. While there are undeniably moments of pop catchiness, they fade within seconds. Furthermore, if you are masochist enough to subject yourself to any footage of the act, you will find a revolting arrogance that is so dreadfully misplaced that it will turn your stomach. The next time that you find yourself ever-so-briefly caught in that forgetful moment you will want to immediately destroy the device from which their putrid music emanates."
5,Cracked Rear View Rocks!,"You need to buy Cracked Rear View. It is the best cd Hootie has ever done. Some of my favoite songs are ""Hold My Hand"" ""Time"" and ""Only Wanna Be With You"" Buy their other cds too."
4,Pretty Good,"I liked this CD better than the second...Good sound, good writing. They are pretty good in concert too..I'm tired of mistermaxx's very negative reviews...he seems not to be very open to rock and roll music!"
1,"Personally, I prefer fingernails on a chalkboard.","Whether it's a Big Mac, TV dinners or Hootie and the Blowfish, it's amazing what cr*p you can feed to the American public as good. Nice guys but dreadful music."
1,boring,first off the bat the first time i heard hold my hand i thought another song by pearl jam.but when i saw Darius Rucker my mouth hit the floor.he sounded to me like Eddie Veader.but after listening to the record I felt that Darius Rucker has a voice but needs some grooves behind him.the band is your everyday bar band.nothing special at all.how in the world did they ever blow up?
1,At first listen......,"There was one tune that I liked.... For about five minutes. I have to believe the people that like this stuff have only heard it almost less than once. This guys monotone voice has the quality of scratching fingernails on a chalkboard. It is just flat annoying and is just enough to make your skin crawl with discomfort. Even worse it all, all sounds the same."
3,Very Vanilla,"Whereas this CD is an entertaining listen, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Hootie seems like a record company contrivance manufactured for heavy radio rotation. If that's your taste, this CD is perfect for you. If you're starving for the originality that has been mostly absent throughout the 90's, you must, once again, look elsewhere."
5,The Album That Started It All,"I remember way back in 1994 I was watching MTV and the video for ""Let Her Cry"" came on and I was immediately hooked. I went out and bought the record and have been a fan ever since. ""Cracked Rear View"" is just as fresh today as it was when I bought the record almost 12 years ago. This album has so many his; ""Hold My Hand"", ""Let Her Cry"", ""Only Wanna Be With You"" and ""Time"". The thing is that the other tracks that weren't singles are just as excellent. My personal favorite song from the record that wasn't a single is either ""Hannah Jane"" or ""Running From An Angel"". This really did define Rock in the 90's."
3,"Not bad, but not exceptional.","I bought Musical Chairs and loved it. I figured that I would love Cracked Rear View just as much. I bought it, and it's not all that bad. There is one thing I must say, though: THIS CD IS OVERRATED!!! It's not the greatest rock CD of all time, and personally I don't think it's even a classic. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad, but this is NOT an exceptional album. I really liked Drowning, Let Her Cry, and Only Wanna Be With You, though."
4,"Safe, predictable, but damn catchy","Hootie and the Blowfish's debut is definitely worth a buy for those who still don't own it, but in all honesty, Hootie and the Blowfish, much like Blues Traveler, The Spin Doctors, and The Dave Matthews Band, are very safe and predictable. It may sound like I'm knocking Hootie, The Spin Doctors, and Blues Traveler, but I'm not. I own (and proudly enjoy) albums by all these bands, and I think that all of us need some things in our lives that are predictable to balance out all the chaos life throws at us; especially with our music. It's a shame that younger people these days don't appreciate that. Sometimes we don't need something particularly bizarre, out-of-left-field, or aggressive to express ourselves. Sure, I also have days where I'll listen to The Offspring's Ignition or PIL's Flowers of Romance, but I listen to Cracked Rear View and Travelers & Thieves just as much."
4,I CAN NO LONGER FRONT...,"It's strange how a band can be the hugest act in America and the most hated all at the same time.This strange pop paradox fits Hootie & The Blowfish like a glove.Down-home South Carolina boys playing unoffensive,very enjoyable,heartland style rock.Hootie offered an alternative to the morose,moody stylings of grunge in the world of rock/pop inthe mid '90s and turned out to have one of the best-selling albums in US history with this 1994 debut,""Cracked Rear View"".Now I know that it's ""against the rules"" for a credible musicfan to display love towards a unabashed mainstream pop act butI happened to like Hootie's brand of feel-good frat boy rock!:-)""Time"",the lovelorn hit ""Let Her Cry"",""I Only Want To Be With You"",and the criminally overplayed ""Hold My Hand""-all down-home,Americana-styled pop/rock songs that are as easy and cozy as a Southern breeze.Those who bash Hootie seem to be missing the point.They never seemed to proclaim themselves as intellectual rockers"
5,Mission Accomplished,"This album is full of strong vocals, hard hitting guitar chords, and upbeat lyrics. This pop/rock band creates a great sound. This album does not have a rating. It has eleven tracks and a run time of 46 minutes and 43 seconds. The album, under Atlantic Records label, was released on July 5, 1994. ""Cracked Rear View"" is currently available for under ten dollars. The subtle mix of upbeat songs and slower ballads makes for a great album. The lead vocals, performed by Darius Rucker, are very baritone with a little raspy sound. The harmonies are perfectly placed within each song. This album sold over 12 million copies when it was first released and will always be a great album to have in your collection. Hootie and the Blowfish acommplished exactly waht they had set out to and they did it well."
3,"Hold on, this isn't that spectacular...","I'm not a huge fan of this stuff. I definetely agree with an earlier reviewer who says this music is too derivative--nothing that original. The lead vocalist does have a very distinctive voice, however, and I tend to enjoy half the songs. I can only listen to it once every couple of months though as it would get old WAY too fast if I played it any more often. It serves it's purpose though as a slightly above average album from a slightly above average band. But that's all I'm giving them."
2,A snoozer,You have to give this band credit for somehow convincing their fans that they love to hear the same five notes over and over and over. Most of these songs you could play with one finger on a toy piano. The band has potential: they should challenge themselves more.
3,Fantastic trash,"I just read all the comments and I have to say I agree with all of them. I agree with the one star reviews in that there's nothing innovative or remarkable about the lyrics, musicality or arrangement of the songs and yes, they are monotonous. But you know what? I LOVE IT! What happened to enjoying some good musical trash? People should like what they like, not what they think they should like ... ie. artists that push the boundaries of music. Buy it and revel in it!"
5,The best money can buy.,"Not to many groups I've ever heard of sold 13 million copies of an album in a year. They have the best songs around, ""Only Wanna be With You,"" and ""Drowning."""
4,Very enjoyable,"This is a book that any beginner would love to own. It's richness does not come from a wide variety of minerals included; rather, it comes from the joy that the author pours into it, as well as her numerous accounts of acutally working with the techniques and tips contained herein.Color and Crystals is an excellent resource that combines a good working knowledge of the chakras, with information about toning, crystals, healing with colour, kundalini, and more. The author has studied numerous complementary and alternative modalities, and this concise volume relfects her passion for the healing arts.Techniques for rebalancing, recognizing over and underactive chakras, working with quartz crystals and other stones, and colour therapies are present in Joy's book, as well as experiments, a reccomended basic healing kit, and helpful insight about the healing process overall. Basic though it may be, it is a nice way to revisit many things that even practiced healers take for granted."
2,Audible Clicks Remastered Poorly???,Great Music! Great Joe!but...This recording has audible glitches in it.Several times throughout there are digital clicks.Was it in the original recording? Did they try to fix it in the remastering process?Who knows...but it is a shame to have such flaws.Get the Big World Album instead.
4,One of Joe Jackson's best !,"""Cha Cha Loco"" is one of Joe Jackson's best songs .... Quite a different direction for him .... easily my favorite ..."
4,Joe Jackson - Sometimes You Can Get What You Want.......,"After the huge success of Jackson's previous album ""Night And Day"" Joe continued in generally the same direction musically although inflicting even more jazz, soul, and R & B influences here. The album produced the big hit with the snazzy ""You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Get What You Want), and was a successful album commercially. I like this one quite a bit better than ""Night And Day"". The album starts out a little slow for me as ""The Verdict"" and ""Cha Cha Loco"" are probably my two least favorite songs on the album, but after that with the possible exception of ""Go For It"", everything is great. ""Not Here Not Now"", the instrumental ""Loisaida"", ""Happy Ending"" which features an incredible vocal duet between Jackson and Ellen Foley, the somber duet ""Be My Number Two"" and the rousing finale ""Heart Of Ice"" are all top notch Jackson. For the most part this is a very strong Joe Jackson album and probably an essential disc for fans."
5,Perhaps Joe's Best Pop Effort!!!!!!,"Body and Soul I believe is the climax of Joe's career as a pop musician,thusfar.Cover to cover Body and Soul is simply brillaint. From the opening notes of ""The Verdict"" to the jazzy ""Heart Of Ice"" this album demonstrates the versatility in Joe's writing and evoloution as a performer. His writing is superior, the writing lyrically is just as awesome as the music. IF you purchase only a few JJ albums..put this at the very top of your list! Persoanl favorites of mine are ""The Verdict"" ""You Can't Get what You Want (Til You Know ..) and might I suggest that anyone who starts to lean towards self pity to play ""Go For It"" really really loud!"
1,How to butcher a classic,"This must be one of my all-time favourite CDs. And one of the best-sounding albums of all time as well, thanks to Joe Jackson's early use of digital recording techniques combined with vintage microphones. Which makes the mystery all the greater: what on earth happened in 1997, when the record company decided to remaster this?The dynamics of the remaster are, admittedly, more up-to-date. But there are loud popping noises on almost all the tracks, notably on the opener The Verdict (after about 29 seconds). At times it sounds painfully like an old vinyl LP...and yet none of these faults were present on the original CD release. Add to this the poor quality of the sleeve and booklet (what happened to the colours?) and it's a total disaster. I can only hope that someday, someone will release a ""Deluxe"" edition like that of Night And Day and restore this pioneering recording to its original glory."
1,Intellectualizing the Obvious!,"Fukyama, Professor of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins, has managed to take three obvious conclusions that most Americans have already reached - absent PhDs or expensive tuition - and create 240 boring, useless pages. These conclusions are: 1)The Bush administration wrong made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy. 2)It also badly misjudged global reaction. 3)The Bush administration's third error was failing to appreciate the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.The fact that Fukuyama was a neoconservative supporter does not change the triviality of the conclusions; it does, however, demonstrate that, unlike President Bush, he is open to accepting contrary information.A total waste of time, money, and paper."
4,fake bait and an empty hook,"I am both impressed and disappointed with Fukuyama's latest work. What impresses me is Fukuyama's incredibly extensive knowledge of American history (including the history of American ideas) and his savvy with respect to American foreign policy. In America at the Crossroads he shows his brilliance as an astute critic of neoconservatism and the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war. I reckon I must be impressed with what is in the book. My disappointment, then, must be owed to what is not in the book; namely, a robust alternative to neoconservative ideology, which Fukuyama promises in the introduction, but never delivers."
3,"International readers, beware!","This is a good account of the history of neoconservative political philosophy. The author also highlights many of the mistakes made by the current neoconservative leadership in dealing with foreign affairs, while attempting to distance those mistakes from true neoconservative doctrines (i.e. saying that the problem is with the policy makers and not with neoconservatism).There are also recommendations on how foreign affairs might be better managed in the future. These might be considered good recommendations if you are a staunch neoconservative supporter or prefer the narrow 'American interests' approach.For the international readers however, you will be struck by the emphasis placed in these recommendations upon establishing policies or systems that are clearly geared toward providing a facade of international legitimacy to whatever best serves the solidification of American hegemony.Another 'Mama America knows best' account!"
3,The history of the neoconservative movement and its hijacking.,"OK, I am not a neoconservative. However, I wanted to know a little more about this movement since many in the Administration are deemed neoconservatives. Fukuyama makes his point that real neoconservatives didn't want to go to war in Iraq. An element of the neoconservative movement made that decision much to the dismay of most leading members. He then cites the reasons why the Iraq War was not on the neoconservative agenda. I am not sure his different shadings of political movements made sense. What does make sense are the wrong reasons we went to war in Iraq.This is a politics book and attempts to put a political label on what neoconservatives, conservatives, and liberals are. I am not sure we can put everybody in a political category. However, the book gave me a somewhat better idea what neoconservatives stand for on the foreign policy agenda of this country."
4,Worked great...,I purchased this item to control my music from the captains chair while my head unit stayed dry and hidden. Works great and was supplied with a splitter so I could keep my CD changer hooked up as well. Love the function however the buttons are a little hard to push and somewhat clumsy feeling at first. The unit is almost a good 5 and a half inched around so make sure you have enough room to mount it before ordering I ended up building a custom fiberglass housing for it on my dash.
4,good product great price,everything was good about this product. The description and information was provided right there along with the price.
2,Not worth it honestly.,"I decided to purchase the RMX55M instead of the lesser expensive one b/c of the LCD option. I thought it would be great to be able to see what song is playing and to browse through my iPod easier. Well that would be great, except when you plug in an iPod or other USB device, the LCD only shows ""USB."" SERIOUSLY?!?! What's the point of it then? The only real benefit is that you can see the volume level... I guess. Save yourself the extra money and purchase the one without the LCD."
5,Sony RMX55M Marine Remote,"The sony remote was priced far and away lower than any other seller on the net, and since I hadn't heard of this compnay before, I was skeptical, but since I am in Iraq I thought, what the heck I can wait a little longer for delivery. The remote showed up three days after I ordered it though to my fiancee in Wisconsin. I didnt even have time to tell her it was coming. What an awesome job getting it out immediatly. It arrived new in an unopened box and packaging. I cant wait to try it out when I get back home. I would definitly order again from this company."
2,"LCD is useless for iPhone, USB, Androids.","I bought this wired remote specifically to browse the songs on my iPhone, check the song name while it's playing and all. All it shows on the LCD when I connect my iPhone is ""USB"". I connected an android phone and it also says USB. Pretty disappointing. I'm done with Sony Marine Audio. I'm getting Clarion next."
5,Dance your way to fitness,"I bought this DVD last year and never seemed to get around to writing a review as I was new to the writing game then. I love bellydancing and have since bought many learn to bellydance and bellyrobics DVDs. This ""sensuous"" workout really is one of my favorites, on mornings when I feel like doing a ""sensuous"" workout instead of a strenuous workout, I go for this one. Lots of circles, hiplifts and ""sensuous"" figure 8's, all are muscle toners. Circles are fantastic on the upper thighs and the lower bottom while the figure 8's work the hips and upper bottom. In fact the lower the impact of the workout the more fat you will burn, the higher the impact, you lean more toward sugar and fluid loss thus dehydrating, so as soon as you eat, the weight you lost during your high impact workout will be gained. The music on this DVD is wonderful too and puts you in a real mood for the moves. Sensuously, dance your way to fitness."
3,Just pure workout for abs and lower back,This DVD is great if you're interested in toning your abs and strengthening your lower back... but that's it. I've been bellydancing for awhile and I find that this DVD is a good bellydancing introductory.Shamira hits the basic steps for hip movements and only hip movements missing basic steps for the feet and arms.The run time is rather short. It left me dissatisfied. It would be nice to see one bellydance routine as an extra just so you can get a better idea on how to put it all together.
2,Sensuous workout not so sensuous,I have several Bellydance workouts by different artists. I did not enjoy this workout at all. It had received such great reviews that I just had to order it. I've only done this workout once and walked away from it feeling disappointed. It has been several months since I did this workout so I apologize for not being able to go into specifics...sorry.
4,Amusing and child-oriented,"What can one say about a book that clearly goes through the possible ideas a young child might entertain? This book has some very funny pictures to match some very clear notions of what is not worth doing, including playing with poo and bothering the household's pet. Like all books for young children, it should be read out loud and with room for discussion. But don't worry about leaving it around for your youngster to check out; keep in mind that this book is based on a child's repetoire of ideas, not an adult's. And take it as lightly as it is offered, to be enjoyed with a child."
2,"a review of the DVD, not the movie","I won't review the movie like everyone else has. I have the same minor quibbles about the movie that everyone else has. I missed Peeves, and I missed the logic puzzle, and I missed Norbert's escape. But the movie isn't what's for sale here. The DVD is. I'm so disappointed in the quality of the DVD that I doubt I will ever watch it again. Not one of the special features works for me. My Sony DVD player will not show them at all, and the special features as well as the DVD-ROM-specific features have never worked on my computers. I'm no technophobe and no idiot; I've tried this DVD in three DVD-ROM drives on three computers, in at least four different pieces of DVD player software, and I have yet to get past Ollivander's without catastrophic crashes and multiple scripting errors. I'm considering buying this movie on VHS so that I can see the extra scenes; I know they're on the DVD, but they simply don't work."
2,Almost Boring,"I am a sci fi and fantasy fan, but I found this movie rather slow and the characters not particulary engaging. If you're a big Harry Potter fan or still young enough to imagine yourself being bundled off to wizard school it's probably a lot more engaging, but personally I'll save my DVD buying dollars for the Lord of the Rings. :)"
3,Good Movie...bad DVD,I bought one copy of HP for my neice and one for a friend at work. I got to watch both and BOTH caused glitches on at least one of the machines they played on. The first copy ran great on my computer. On my home unit it jumps to the end of the scene on the part where Harry talks to the snake. My sister has similar difficulty with hers but it froze on the Troll scene.I don't have to add my disgust with the second CD to whats already been said...Its awful...BUT A WORD OF WARNING. After the second CD asks you for Net access on your computer...It can download its OWN DVD player and UNINSTALL YOUR DVD PLAYER SOFTWARE from your computer. This happened to my friend this morning. Not only that but the software it replaced it with failed to work. If you aren't fairly computer literate there is nothing on that second CD worth losing your DVD program for.
2,I was disappointed.,"Harry Potter is a child who attends a school for wizards. Not much really happens in this lackluster and soulless film, and it's story is more fitting for an episode of a TV series than a monstrously budgeted children's film. I was expecting grand adventure and fun, but got a very simple story about some kids messing around in their school trying to stop a meddling bad guy. Really, take away their magic powers, add in more angst, and this could have been an afterschool special."
3,Mystery on 34th Street.,"How long will Mr. H. Potter continue on his insane adventures? Far past puberty, I'm sure."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,My children ages 3 and 5 love this movie! They have watched it over and over and can't get enough of it. My son just started getting into Harry Potter and now my daughter loves it too. It brings much to the imagination.
5,Wonderful Fantasy for Children and Adults alike.,"This is a great movie, it has the excapeism that everyone loves and the adventure we often lack in our own lives. It is wonderful to sit down and excape into this movie. You soon feel you know the characters personally, if you have read any of the books then you are waiting on pins and needles for the new one to be released.The same goes for the next movie, it seems 1 yr. is almost to much, but when it is released and you have seen it at least 4 dozen times it is all worth the wait. I know I am counting the days and re-reading the books I have."
4,"Good, but...","The movie is a good adaptation of the book. It captures the story and the spirit well. However, even at over 2 and a half hours long the movie can't capture the intricacies of the original (book) storyline. While the book is a children's story (according to everyone but Rowling) that is written well enough to keep the average adult reading, the movie has had to be simplified too much. It ends up being just a kids' movie. It's a pretty good kids' movie but it doesn't live up to the hype ... or the book"
3,Good but not up to the book.,"I did not have high expectations for the movie, because frankly I thought live action to be a poor choice for an adaptation of a highly magical work. However, I found that I was wrong and live action indeed worked admirably.The movie is enjoyable and will be highly prized especially by those who have not read the books. However, for those who have I think many will be disappointed. The movie lacks the sparkle of the first novel since many of the humorous vignettes that make the book special have been deleted for lack of time. I would have gladly spared some compression of the plot to spend more time with the Weasleys and other important though not large characters.The main players are fine in their roles. The standouts being newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson playing Ron and Hermione. This is a good movie just not as good as it could or should have been."
5,This Movie is a Defenite Addition to Your Collection,This movie is excellent! It goes hand in hand with the book. The characters are cast to PERFECTION! The special effects are amazing! This movie will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat! I have it and it's a pleasure to watch with the family!
4,Good film,"This first film of the popular book series has its occasional flaws, (notably through the Norbert story) but it is a fair adaption of a wonderful tale."
4,Ultimate Blue Ray DVD Series for Harry Potter Movies,The first in the series and worth the money now. The additional DVD of behind the scenes work and directors comments add immensely to the value of this Blue Ray. I am curious about what the next Ultimate Blue Ray will have in it that has not been seen before. Of course that goes on for the rest of the series as they become available.
4,Love the HD upgrade but lacking,The KD upgrade doesn't fully deliver in this film. Some parts are magically transformed while other moments seem to retain their 480 luster. I think they should have taken more time on this one to perfect it lied they did in later HP movies.
3,"not bad, but not what i expected","Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone: thought there would be more background information on the characters, not just the actors."
5,Unique,"I never read the Harry Potter series, so I didn't know what to expect when I began watching the movie. It was great and a highly imaginative story. The graphics were great and I definately enjoyed navigating through the DVD's special features! I would definately recommend this movie for children and for adults as well. Definately not a disappointing movie."
1,Harry Potter: less than magical,"When I went to see this movie, the first sentence that flashed through my mind was ""This movie is nothing likethe book."" It was horrible. It left out all the best parts of the story and changed the parts it did have. And for God's sake, couldn't they have gotten an actor that looked slightly liked Harry's vivid description in the book? ...And the same goes for everything else in this movie. MUCH less than magical, at least in my and all loyal fans of the books' opinions."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I was one of the people who said that they would never read the Harry Potter books, but I was talked into at least trying the book, and actually I have fallen in love with them, but when I tried the movie after I had read the book, it was a terrible disappointment. As is the case with most movie versions of books. They left out the best parts of the book. The acting was okay...good for the age of the kids and the fact that some had never acted professionally before this movie. I was just very disappointed though because they just skipped major parts of the book that would have worked very well in the movie. I did give it three stars though because it was kind of entertaining, but could have been much better."
1,craving for more...,"there's so many things I have to say about the Harry Potter book, but i don't know where to begin...when I first read the book I said to myself, ""WOW!"" Harry Potter is a beautiful written novel. J.K. Rowling is a very creative and bright author because of that book which makes me crave for the 5th Book-""Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix"" and it's 6th Book-""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""...and not just that! Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is so cute!!!"
5,still have not received my product,"Good afternoon everyone.I would like to thank you for sending this product that arrived after a certain time.came very well packaged and well protected, I recommend.thanks"
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,This magical movie brings the audience on a trip into Harry's magical world! It will amaze you what with all of the quiditch matches and Voldemort lurking around. Will Harry find out who is trying to steal the stone? Will he find out what the stone is? Find out in this terrific display of J.K. Rowling's wild imagination!
5,Very Refreshing Story !!!,"I have seen this movie already three times in the theaters, and I am planning to buy the DVD widescreen version. One of the things that most impressed me is that may three year old child was mesmerized by the film and did not fall to sleep both times that he has seen it.JK Rowlings did a wonderful job of writing a book so interesting. I believe that the most amazing aspect of the story is that it is about everyday life at a not so common school.The film is almost like reading the book. No complaint about it. It is still nice to read the book, but the film brings into being the wonderful caracters of Harry and Hermione.If you have not read the book, the vocabulary may be a little difficult, so that you have to see it at least twice. If you read the book is just wonderful to watch the movie.I give it five stars for the wonderful story telling and imagination."
4,wonderful movie with a good DVD,"I guess almost everybody has seen the movie, so I'll stick to the DVD review only.A beatifully packed DVD. When I opened the DVD pack, for a minute I did nothing but admire the DVD cover.The second DVD is full of stuff for kids. As for me, it was a little below expectation. I expected stuff like interview with JK Rowlings, making of the movie, etc. But there is nothing much for the grown-ups. The only thing I found interesting were the deleted scenes. But they are not easily accesible. You have put in your harry knowlege to reach the deleted scenes.To summarize, it is definately a great(must) buy for kids. But otherwise buy the DVD for the movie (and offcourse deleted scenes) but do not expect too much special stuff."
4,It's magical!,This is a great movie.Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry Potter and puts a spell on everyone in the world!The second movie is released and I'm waiting for the third one.Too bad they are not goin' to make the fourth one!
3,Not A Fan,"I must admit, I never read any of the Harry Potter books and spent most of the movie quite confused.Nice special efx, but the story was quite muddly"
3,Huh?????????!!!!!!!!!!,Personally I despesze Harry Potter!I like watching movies but god it didn't make much sense to me.This movie left out stuff in the book and ohh!The thought of watching this movie was bad.It was really confusing and I couldn't figure out what was going on.I wouldn't mind seeing any of the other movies but as long as they don't have the extras.The extras were bogus and even though they were thought to be funny they weren't.Don't buy it.
3,"The Books Are Better, But Still Good","OK, I have see the movie, but I must say that it's very much a kids movie, very entertaining & I did enjoy it, but I really like the books better. They did change a few things, from the book, but I can't really compare the two, that's not fair! But I do have to pick at 1 thing & that was, did they even name his owl? Because I can't even remember Harry calling her Hedwig!!!!I am more a LOTR fan, But I did enjoy both (LOTR more) & won't compare them too each other :)All I have to say is, I hope the DVD version is much more longer!!!!Still all the best to the kids :)"
2,Harry Potter,"I've never been a fan of Harry Potter. I made attempts at reading the 1st, and 2nd books, and stopped barely to the middle of each. Still, I went to see this movie in theaters with my friends. Although the movie really pulled you in, and the world of Hogwarts was so creative and entertaining, I hated this movie! It scared me so bad that I was afraid every night for about a month. I would not recommend this movie for younger kids. I also have a question for Harry Potter fans: Doesn't it ever make you feel depressed? Harry Potter always makes me feel a little depressed, for some obvious reason."
3,Mediocre,"This movie is perfect for most Harry Potter fans, who were delightled to see their visions of Hogwarts and the Magical World come to life on the big screen. However, for me, this movie was more of an exercise in frustration than anything else, as I beleive the adaption from the book is not as faithful as it could be (see Lord of the Rings for an incredibly faithful book-to-movie transition.)"
4,Great Movie - Frustrating Special Features,"Like the director, Chris Columbus, I believe that since the book was so well done, the movie shouldn't change anything significant. I needn't go on about the actors, scenery, music, etc. It's all very well done and extremely entertaining.The movie itself gets 5 stars from me.My review subtracts a star for the second disk which I found extremely frustrating. There is some very nice material included but it's so difficult to find while wading through the inconsequential filler material that it almost isn't worth it.BTW - if you have a search function on your DVD player (on my remote, it is accessed through the 'Display' button) the deleted scene access screen is #77"
2,Only Ok,The Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is only ok because it fails to capture the magic of the book. In addition important elements were left out while some casting decisions are terrible.For example:Hermione (Emma Watson): They chose cuteness over accuracy so she isn't as bossy or intimidating as she should be. She does not look the part..too cutesy.DumbleDore (Richard Harris): Harris didn't want to do this part but his grandaughter made him and it shows. He is too subdued and there is no twinkle in his eye. Very bad compared to his performance in Gladiator.Ron (Rupert Grint): Only makes weird expressions throughout the movie..you call this acting?As for leaving out important stuff..wasn't it important for Harry to know why Snape hates him? Leaving out the Snape's poision obstacle was very wrong too. The DVD should have given us the full 4 hour version.Anyways I have high hopes for the next installment..I heard it is Chris Columbus' last. Yay!
1,GAG ME!!!!,"Ugh, this movie takes everything away from Harry Potter! First of all, wasn't it ""so exciting"" that all these kids were reading instead of watching TV, and now they go and make a MOVIE. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Furthermore, I am not only disgusted that J.K. Rowling would let the book be made into a movie, but also that she would APPROVE of this one! It had very little of the plot in it, and the children were terrible actors. The one reason I had gone to see it was to watch the Quiddich, which was just plain awful! The people looked like SIMS! You know, from the computer game? All in all, a waste of time and money!"
1,one of the worst movies i've ever watched,"The first 20 minutes were ok and kept me entertained, but once Harry gets to the school, there ia a whole hour of dreamy, pointless nothingness that left me empty and asleep. Following that there is a whole sequence where Harry plays some game where he has to catch some gold bug thing, and that is followed by about 30 minutes of plot development, which was ok. I'll let you be the judge and not give away the exciting ending."
4,Minimum DVD bonuses,"No question that the book is great, and the movie itself is excellent. This being said, the DVD is extremely disappointing. No extended scenes, no ""making of"", a bunch of worthless cheap, CD-ROM style features, and one - ONE! - interview. Very, very disappointing.I know that the lord of the Rings has spoiled all of us, but that's not even average."
3,To tell anyone how much I avoid movies like this...,"On its Disney Channel premiere last Friday, I only watched the opening studio logo and the opening shot at Privet Drive. Then I turned on the news instead--and that was it. (The same thing happened whenever HBO had it.)Everything in the Potter franchise is so full of witchcraft that it is only enough for Christians like me to turn on something else. If morals are what you're looking for when it comes to good family entertainment, then please settle down with Care Bears, Lord of the Rings or Finding Nemo wherever you can find them!I didn't even bother watching the Chamber of Secrets--and hence, nor will I watch Azkaban, nor read any of the Rowling books in my lifetime again.***/5 stars"
2,Oversold product of an overactive imagination,"Not much of a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genre, an overseas flight offered me the opportunity to see what I had understood to be a delicious, imaginative story of an orphan finding himself. Instead, I found the creative elements to be more boring and mundane than exciting, the kids to be overly stereotyped, and the plot more banal than bodacious.The story blends recycled elements of Dickens with Star Wars and Ben Hur only with tens of millions spent on 'special' effects. Expecting colorful characters, I found only silly characters dressed extravagantly drawn by aging if not ancient English thespians. Fighting off sleep was more of a challenge than the twists of the tale. And the bits of terror are inappropriate for any child under age thirteen, unless you accept that young people need to have nightmares.Thank goodness they didn't charge me for the headphones on the flight!"
1,"Children should watch ""The Chronicles of Narnia Instead""","Having seen Lord Of The Rings & Harry Potter Movies, I was mystified how it has such a large following. I thought it was a bunch of purple-prosed jibberish with a fragmented, weak plot. Not to mention the other detrimental negative apects of the questionable handling of the magic/occult.Having seen The Chronicles of Narnia; I think I can understand why the world would play up LOTR & Harry.Narnia is such a magnificent work with thematic purpose that the prince of this world would attempt to overshadow it as an inferior comtemporary work compared to Tolkien's LOTR jibberish or Harry Potter confusing nonsense.C.S. Lewis was a Christian and his work ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is powerful.Children should see Narnia - especially ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"". Parents will be accountable to what they expose their children to."
2,"Cheesy, dull, unmagical. Read the book-- or play outside","Thuddingly literal adaptation which races so hard to get every famous incident into the movie that it has no time for characterization, magic, humor, any of the qualities that made the books charming. The kids are relatively colorless and adults who seem perfectly cast (from Alan Rickman to John Cleese) are given next to nothing to do. A more joyless example of how British wit can be turned into expensive American product can hardly be imagined-- this is the kind of movie that, given a choice between showing us a magnificently designed set for Gringott's Bank or a pile of phony gold, encourages us to ooh and ahh over the pile. Well, don't add to this movie's pile."
1,I would rather watch my dog puke.,"The characters, the story, everything is stupid in this movie. I wasn't to impressed by the eye candy either. This movie makes me sick."
1,HAROLD POTTER MOVIES ARE THE WORST EVER!!!,0 stars is how it should be ranked! Why are people so foolish in watching & buying this garbage? What is so great on watching these dweeby little Harold Potter movies??? A bunch of stupid wizardy crap that makes absolutely no sense at all! You really have to be gullable to believe this nonsense! That Radcliffe character must no have no talent to do other motion pictures besides Harold Potter movies! There is a part 4 H. potter movie out now...When are these dumb movies ever going to end? They should have never started in the first place anyway! Like I said it before if you are buying into this junk then you must not have anything better to do..What a waste of time!!!
2,Dissapointing,"I had read the book before I watched the movie, and actually didn't like it. So I decided, well... maybe the movie and their little cubbie pop star Radcliff could fix the story line and all a bit up so that it would make a tad of senseI watched the movie, and was utterly dissapointed. If you have a child with you, its a great movie, but when you really think of all the unrealities Harry Potter and his frends could have taken i.e Ron as a Knight and not dying?? To me, Ron not dying is like in the Lord of the Rings FOTR, except its Boromir, and it made 1000's of times more sense.For childish minds and children, great movie. For people who love happy endings or want a family movie.For Lord of the Rings realists, and people that like good movies, a dissapointment."
2,"Good, but disappointing","This was a good movie in general. However, I have to disagree with people who thought that it stayed pretty true to the book. It did in some parts, but I felt that it changed or left out stuff that would have been just as easy to leave in. Such as, Professor Snape's potions charm that is an obstacle to the Sorcerer's Stone was left out. Also, in that same scene Harry not playing the flute that Hagrid gave him to soothe Fluffy. On that thought, the role of Hagrid was terrible! They made him seem so stupid. I hope that the next movie stays truer to the book."
2,peeves!,did peeves the poltergiest make this movie?.cause hes not in the film.i was so dissapointed with harry potter.i almost fell asleep during the forbidden forest bit even though its my faivourite chapter in the book.snape is a bit dull.dumbledore is dull and mcgonnagall dull.why doe s flitwick look like a gargoyle.ron and hermione are ok but i hope the next one is better.
2,not what i expected,"from what i was expecting this movie NOT impressing. they left out key parts ex.- potions during the quest to the stone. the only good thing about the dvd is that the ""extra things"" at the end were really fun"
3,"great movie, stupid ending","The ending really needed to be different. I wasted 23 dollars for this movie. I wouldn't be that sad about if they had a alternative ending but this ending licks eggs. Don't see the second movie until it comes on video. Rent it, don't see it in theathers or buy it."
1,Outraged,"I am a huge fan of the books, and I suggest that if you are too, don't see the movie! The movie takes out so many details and scenes that should be there! Take my word for it, it's not worth the money, just read the books!"
2,What happened??,"I have not read the books so I am rating this as a new viewer.This movie started out great and had a touch of class few movies have anymore. It was catchy and entertaining. However, it takes a twist into a D&D; segment and totally throws you for a loop. I lost interest as my kids who were dying to see it. The ending was really weak, as well. We all know that Harry is the hero, but come on! They could've done something a bit better than that TOTALLY EXPECTED end sequence when the different houses were being awarded for their points. YAWN.All I suggest is you rent it before you buy it... I'm glad I did!"
2,BORING MOVIE,THE WORST KIDS MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING IT MADE ME FALL ASLEEP. THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE. READ THE BOOK
4,As good as the book? Not really......,"Let me be honest. When the fourth book of the series was released and people went wild, I had no idea who Harry Potter was. I did my research, saw the trailers for the film, then actually went and saw it a few days after it was released. I was less than impressed with the film.(Take into account I had not read the books up to this point.) Don't get me wrong, the idea, the whole concept behind the film was great, but it the whole movie to me was, well, boring. After seeing the movie I decided to read the books. The sorcerer's stone is a fantastic book. Very enjoyable reading, and as I was reading it, I could picture the scenes of the movie in my mind. I have just about finished the second book, having started it only yesterday, and am actually looking forward to the Chamber of secrets in theaters. I'm going to give the movie a second chance when it comes out on DVD, because now I understand more about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon."
5,POTTER ROCKS!,"Although doesn't go with the book so well it is a Great DVD.First of all they cut out Peeves completly wich was really dumb and they skipped the potions thing with harry and hermonie down in the trapdoor place. Hagrid isn't that big like he's mentioned in all the books AND poffessor Q-Querial in the forrbiden forest looks like a Dementor. Other than that this movie ROCKS!I really have to say I loved the quidditch match even though they only showed 1. Uncle Vernon is very fat very much like his son Dudley (Dudders as his Aunt calls him). His Aunt very skinnyand Mean. DUN DUN BOOM. Voldemort looks OK but not perfect.Now to my complementsThe DVD is very long which I like because I like long Movies. I love the special walk through Hogwarts thing on the DVD. THe Movie is so full of exeitment and action. There are 4 houses in Hogwarts Griffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. My Favorate is Ravenclaw! I hate Griffindor! Any way if you want a good DVD this is it."
4,Good but not that Great,"I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. When I first saw the movie in theaters I was very excited. The special effects were great. the actors were magnificent but movie is not that faithful to the first book. If you have not read Harry Potter you will probably give this 5 stars. It did twist some of the scenes to make the movie shorter but as a fan when I saw it I thought ""that's not how it happened..."" The music by John Williams is definitely the best. The special features on the second disc are not worth it though. If you are a Potter fan this DVD is a must have and the soundtrack too!"
4,Four Stars for Kids,"HPSS is definitely worth seeing once for an adult and probably thirty times for a youngster. The effects are very nice, and the story as everyone knows, is fun and intriguing. Do not recommend a buy for adults, but if you have kids it is a must."
4,Great for all ages,Wonderfully done movie for all ages and the cast is well put together! We recently bought this movie and really enjoyed it. Not much to say about the second disc though as it didn't live up to our expectations. Not only is it slow to manuver through but the interviews were short and rather dull. Definetly look for the deleted scenes on the second disc though as they are worth finding.
2,Boring,I saw this movie to see what the Harry Potter hysteria was all about. Fifteen minutes into the show I was bored. There was one interesting part where a character we thought was a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. I think the three kids with the starring roles are good actors and cute kids though. I just didn't think this was a very good movie. I couldn't wait for it to end.
1,What a disapointment!,"While the HP books were outstanding, the movie had so much potential that it's very dissapointing to actually see the result. The acting was bad, the effects poor, and the direction seemed to think this is a starwars movie. The Quidditch scene was almost exactly the same as the Pod Racing scene on SW-EP1!Waste of time, this is 2 hours of my life I want back!"
2,More energy than a tub of dead fish,"I think this movie sucked. I'm a fan of the books, and I say Mr. Columbus worried too much about being too faithfull. It had no life of it's own. One example; John Hurt is normally a good character on screen, and he should have been in this, also, especially as the fun character that the wand-seller in the book was. He wasn't. It was one of the most boring scenes in the movie. I only give it two stars because of the Quidditch match.Thanks Chris, for putting Harry Potter images into my head which are far less stimulating than my own imagination."
4,Just the Beginning,"This was a wonderful adaptation of Rowling's Harry Potter - the 1st in a series. Very faithful to the book - although I must admit the text was much more 'complete'. You don't have to read the book to enjoy the movie. While some may view the story line as lacking, this is just the 1st in the series and serves as the basis of all that is to come. It's your introduction to Harry and friends at Hogwarts. What follows is even more creative."
4,Great DVD the interface isn't the best,"There is no need is describing what a wonderful movie this is. The DVD quality is excellent, but the interface for the special features is difficult at best. They advertise never before scenes on TV, but it must take a wave of the Nimbus 2000 to find just those scenes on the DVD. It took my family 2 nights to try to find these before we gave up. Very frustrating. Excellent movie though :) My feelings are this, this is a children's related movie, but it takes magic to work your way around the DVD."
3,The Movie--With Tons Of Lame Extras!,"Good Lord. Now, I liked the Harry Potter movie, so this is mainly a rant on the inaccessibility of the DVD version: Disc 2 is loaded with a bunch of useless stuff, and it's nigh-on impossible to get to the deleted scenes (which I was dying to see). If you get this turkey and want the nice extras, be prepared to jump through hoops just to find them."
3,Good Movie Marred by Mediocre DVD,"The movie is good, widescreen is always nice, the bitrate is high, and enough other reviews have been written for content. But the DVD presentation drags the whole rating down. There appears to be a layer transition problem around 28:42. There is no director's commentary. The menu loads are overly long. Most of the extras really aren't that great. And, what is probably the best part of the extras, the deleted scenes, aren't even easily accessible without wasting twenty-five minutes of your life playing mini-games. Get the movie, but don't expect a good DVD design."
5,Just great wordds cant describe it,"Wow, wow and wow what a movie. Being a fan of the books I could not wait to see this movie and when I did I was just blown away. One of the best films ever it's jsut great. You will be sucked into the world from start to finish. the acting is great the story is great it's jsut a great film. It's one movie you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. The best film of the year."
2,Full blown letdown,"I finally bought the movie. I can't believe what a shallow story line it had. This was a slow movie. I suggest that whatever few haven't seen it yet; to wait for it to play on TV, or just keep a close eye at garage sales, ..., for this.I was really disappointed by the degree of hype associated to this movie. I wished I would have read 'my' review before buying it.... :("
4,Harry Potter And The Reviewer's Stone,"If you like Lord Of The Rings and the book series Everworld, you will LOVE this movie. According to the title, it is the first movie of the Harry Potter book series, however it is a little bit different. I hate spoilers, so I am not going to tell you what is going to happen.The rating does make it's effect in this movie.Violence: Just a bit. The rating PG. I dont think kids under 10 would understand it.Sex: None.I give it a 7/10 because it really is a very good movie."
5,Intelligent Fantasy for a New Age,"Harry Potter on DVD brings the excitement home. It makes the perfect gift for children and adults alike. Harry Potter is intelligent reading and viewing, guaranteed to keep the children enthralled for hours and he's a good role model, not like the slaughterhouse-style anime which is popular these days.The DVD provides lots of extras and combined with reading the books with it, it comes across well. There's enough action and story to keep the adults interested as well. Once you think the story is told, another twist comes up. Excellent movie (and by the way, The Chamber of Secrets -in Theaters now- was/is just as good.)Combined with the books, the tale turns out beautifully on and off screen.Robert Eldridge (...)"
3,"Good movie, but the DVD was dissappointing","What was the point of 2 DVDs? I find the 2nd DVD kinda pointless. All there really is to see is drawings and some deleted scenes, the rest is just a whole game. I think this DVD was just made to make more money for the WB, because everyone will want to buy this, and then they'll release a specail edition or director's cut DVD later, and everyone will go buy that one too. I'm not saying it'll happen, it's just my theory. I only reccomend you buy this if you really, really liked this movie."
4,This movie was wonderful!!!,"I found this movie to be exciting . It has to be my 2nd favorite movie by far . First is Titanic of course . This movie almost made 1 Billion in movie sales . Unbealevable? just try Titanic that was the best selling movie in Theaters right now that made 1.8 Billion Dollars .(Clears his throut)Now back to the subject . For all the Harry Potter fans...Just go ahead and buy the video , I'm possitive that u'll enjoy it . These are my ratings for the movie....Graphics:9/10Tiny parts of the movie could've done better.Sound:10/10The music is wonderful . Fully orchestrated music .Replay Value:10/10I'm sure that u'll want to see it again and again."
3,DVD disappointing for MAC users,"For those of us who own a Mac, we will not be able to view the extra scenes. I found this very disappointing. To buy a DVD which states there will extra scenes on the DVD and to not have the opportunity to enjoy them. This is a fairy tale. I rate the actual movie 4 1/2 stars, the DVD 2 stars."
3,Doesn't match the book but still up there.,The scorcerers stone has been stolen! that's what the book said and that's what this movie said. I really didn't actually enjoy this movie but it was still quite entertaining. It is a fantasy about a boy wizard who goes to school to learn magic. Based on Rowlings bestselling books Harry potter's first adventure reaches sky high. When I had read the book but hadn't seen the movie I didn't know how Warner bothers were going to create an actual Quiddich match but they still did it with prestige effort. the movie had no romanical aspects and the comedy was escruciatingly dry. I think Warner bros. should have put even more effort into the acting in the movie but the special effects were pleasing. Luxembugh ratings believes this movie deserves three stars for the poor acting but all other flaws are miniscule.
2,"Not bad, but nowhere near as good as The Lord of the Rings!","Okay, I have to admit, I have never read any of the Harry Potter books and the only reason why I agreed to see this movie was for my niece who is a huge fan of the books. Now while the film has some nifty special effects, the storyline is too slow and the film is aimed for a smaller audience. I wasn't a fan of the books and this film won't make me buy one anytime soon. If your children must see this video then watch it only if the books are interesting for you. If you havn't read any of the books, simply let your children watch it while you pick up a good book to read, like The Lord of the Rings!"
4,Wonderful but missing the finer aspects of the book,"I absolutly loved the movie! People are saying it is a horrible movie and I totally disagree. While it was missing the best parts of the book, it is truly a great movie. The Quidditch scene is exactly as I imagined it. I heard someone say it was too computer generated... yeah, seeing as it WAS computer generated it would be pretty hard not to be! The sets are beautiful and the actors, even the kids, are outstanding! Two out of the three times I saw it, everyone clapped afterwards! I have never seen that happen before! Far better than Lord of the Rings, which, to put it frankly, put me to sleep, this is a movie that everyone, ages 6 - 106 can appreciate and enjoy. I am greatly anticipating the release of the DVD! It will no doubt be great! ...."
4,Magical Beginning,This movie was a great adaptation of the novel. The characters are wonderfully brought to life by the actors. A perfect introduction to Rowling's wizard world and Harry Potter.
5,Great!,This is a great movie! It is just like all the other great Harry Potter movies. Widescreen is a great choice.
5,Harry Potter...the Snow White for Boys!,From the beginning Harry Potter takes you to a different world. The world of a great imagination where anything can happen and does. It takes you through a full range of emotions...happiness and sadness and everything else inbetween. What can I say! I probably loved it more than my children. I've watched over 10 times and I still get over the greatest mystery at the end of the story. I am also a mystery fan and I was totally fooled to the very end of the movie. It's a treasure. If you haven't seen it you should.
4,I enjoyed the special features more,"Having read all HP books & having watched the film in the theatres, I regret to say that I was sort of disappointed with the film. I agree that with the millions of readers & viewers of the HP series, it would be difficult for the cast/crew to satisfy each & everyone's expectations. So, when I got hold of the DVD, I skipped the film & proceeded to see the speacial features.I would say the idea of coming up with 2 discs, one for the film itself + theatrical/teaser trailers & one specially for its added features is a great marketing concept. Going through the 2nd disc made the film seem more interesting & erased all my qualms --- so I ended up watching the film again --- but only after going through the 2nd disc."
1,Wha...,"Don't waste your money on this, I saw the movie in the theater and it was terrible. They tried to introduce all the characters, or as many as possible, bad choice. There were scenes that appeared to have no relevance at all. (can anyone say Nobert?). Finally, for such a high budget movie, you'd think they would make some good special effects."
2,Blue Screen Blues,"Loved the books, loved the audio books even more, but despite the stellar cast, this movie came across as inept. It's a prime example of how blue screen digital derring-do can fall flat on its face. The computer backgrounds were uneven, at times almost cartoonish, and the special effects weren't always that special, from the first look at the outside of Hogwarts to the fake-n-bake Quidditch match. Not seeing some of the best parts of the book was a bit disappointing, but that wasn't the main problem with the movie. It's almost always necessary to eliminate some book episodes to keep the cinema pace moving. What grated the most was the ineptness of the not-so-special effects crew. Truly grade C."
4,Good but important details left out.,"I thought that the movie itself was in fact quite enjoyable but they left out a few scenes and some important details. Being as big of a Harry Potter fan as I am, I was surprised to find that they even changed the way he looked in the movie. In the books it said Harry had jet black hair and green eyes. Well in the movie they gave him dark brown hair and blue eyes. It made me mad to find they changed the main character. But other than that and the fact that they left a few scenes out it was a spectacular movie. I suggest all who love movies to go see this one.It honestly was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile that I've been able to forget the outside world and enjoy what i was seeing. To all that haven't seen this I suggest you do."
3,Not Another Based On a Book Movie!,"This movie was great for the kids, and it whetted an appetite to see some of J.K. Rowling's magic in ""the works,"" but as far as it being better than the books, that couldn't be farther from the truth. I think it would be better off to leave Harry Potter to the imagination, but still... it was kind of cool to see the spells and enchantments of the stories. Take it or leave it."
3,A good movie... But not always..!,"This is a good movie with a little less of action than i hoped... Its not a movie who take you out of the chear and just tearing tou apart! Thats a clear thing... I have seen it a few times, and i got sick of it about the 3. time i watched it... Its no action, and that stuff..! But a still have a feeling abaout that this movie gonna be a classic..! :) But its not a movie i by my self will have in my head all my life..! That is my review... I think i will give it 3 stars..! But i suddently know that this is a good movie for other persons who like adventures in magic..."
2,TIME FOR SELF-SATISFIED HARRY TO RETIRE,"The fourth HARRY film, (following ""The Trouble With Harry Potter,"" ""When Harry Potter Met Sally,"" and the series' high-water-mark, ""Dirty Harry Potter""), is a mostly hollow exercise that does little to enliven a once-lucrative franchise. Smugness and in-your-face special effects are no substitute for interesting characters and genuine inspiration. Desperate."
2,Not as good as the book!,"This movie did not turn out as good as it was said to be. The movie left out out so many parts from the book it was unbelivable. I truly think the book was alot beter.But I Did like the Quidich games, because of the graphics and it'speciel effects."
4,Great fun for Adults who are still kids inside!,The DVD was very entertaining even though we saw the movie twice in the theaters (once with our 4 yr old granddaughter). What was even more fun was the second DVD. My husband and I had a great time searching for things on the DVD and can't wait to try the 'extra credit' on the CD-ROM.
3,DVD Extras Leave Something to be Desired...,"My children loved this movie just as much on DVD as in the theater, we did not notice that some of the sorting hat scene was cut, as stated by other reviewers. Our frustration came with the special features, the software was hard for our computer to run ( there were 3 or 4 different software programs to install ) To see deleted scenes you have to go through the paces, but our computer crashed every time we tried to use the software on the DVD. We DO meet the system requirements and don't usually have trouble with new software. So we feel like we really didn't get the extras, hence the 3 star rating. We are curious if others had trouble with the software. Small children would probably not be able to navigate this DVD on their own at all. Bummer. Still a good movie for the kids."
3,Succeeds in being not lousy...but is boring in parts.,"Sometimes promotional hype takes on a life of it's own and the actual merits of a film can be difficult to determine.If you knew nothing of Harry Potter books or the author and were grading this movie as simply that...a movie, it really doesn't stand up so well.What bugged me the most were the recycled ideas. None of this material is in the least bit original. It's just given a new hair cut and presented to an audience of children who are unaware of how much is borrowed from C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien and a slew of other authors.The film is overly long and doggedly loyal to the book, which offers up no surprises. I had hoped that more children would have looked at this movie and realized it could have been much, much better. As it is, there are some fun scenes, but they are hidden among more boring scenes. I felt as though the movie was always building up to something that never arrived and then the credits rolled."
3,2nd disk DEFECTIVELY printed or designed.,"The DVD movie is as expected, good all around and complete. The 2nd DVD in the set - the one with the extra features, hidden scenes, etc is seriously defective. It WILL LOCK UP your home dvd player every single time if you have one of a group of dvd player makes. All Aiwa and Zenith at a minimum are affected by this. More models out there as well. So far, Warner Brothers has done NOTHING in the US though they have replaced the 2nd disk in the United Kingdom for some reason. If you enter Olivanders wand shoppe and select any of the wand boxes, the dvd locks up and only a power off will allow you to exit and restart. If you want it for the movie only and don't care about the 2nd disk, get it. If you want to enjoy the added features, make sure you test someone elses copy on your DVD player BEFORE YOU BUY or wait to purchase the rental copies for less than full price later this year (2002)."
3,"3 1/2 stars, more faithful to book than most movies","I'm one of those adults who's read the books but missed seeing the movie in the theatres and tried the DVD instead. I found the casting to be very good, although Emma Watson as Hermione is too pretty. The story was amazingly faithful to the book, which is very unusual for any book/ movie adaptation with just a few things edited out or rearranged (I believe Hagrid's gift of the photo album to Harry was a Christmas present, not a going home from school gift). It was certainly close enough that a movie viewer could probably get away with claiming to have read the book. I found the 2nd disc to be infuriatingly difficult to get through, most kids won't like to try that stuff. If , as at least one reviewer says, the seven deleted scenes are that hard to find (why doesn't something tell you they exist and how to look for them?)they'd better be good to put up with that run around."
2,No Deleted Scenes,I read the books - they were a 10Saw the movie - it was about an 8Bought the DVD - it is a 2why a 2 - Never before seen footage does not exist!the box clearly states - See Never before seen footage
5,One little difference between the movie an the book,"I loved Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone! It was absolutely wonderful to read as well as to watch. One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the GryffindorQuidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroon Professor McGonagall enterred was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie."
5,This is a great movie that will be loved for years and years,This movie is simply amazing! Watching it brings me so much joy because i know all the hard work and the effort they put in thi movie payed off they got so much money! The #1 movie of 2001! And probably going to be The #1 selling DVD/VIDEO of 2002! Kudos goes out to everyone who is in it and who made it! And i cant wait for Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secret's!!!!!
4,Pretty good,"I know alot of people weren't very pleased with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone,but I thought it was pretty good. I know they might have changed some parts or cut them out, but the movie makes up for it. It was humorous, and adventurous, not to mention a pretty talented cast. As long as they do their best I'm pretty sure the next one will be great, especially since the second book was one of my favorites. Just because the movie wasn't exactly like the book, doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie, I thought it was cool, because they stayed pretty faithful to the book, so yes, I think I'd reccomend Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone for anyone who likes adventure and likes to have fun."
2,Frustrating DVD,"Okay, call me a muggle, but this DVD just ain't my cup of tea. I suppose I'm used to normal, comprehensible DVDs where if I want to see deleted scenes, I can get them without even thinking. As for this thing? Heavens! My brain practically blew up trying to find the darn things! Okay, so I have to buy a magic wand, enroll in potions class, mix the right potions, select the right bat...AUGH! IF I WANTED A COMPUTER GAME I'D HAVE BOUGHT ONE! Frankly, the deleted scenes weren't even worth looking for anyway.On to disc one, the movie (which is okay) looks exactly as you'd expect it to look: pristine. The bright, widescreen (2.35:1) image makes even that awful Quidditch match look watchable.Among the easy to find extras are trailers and interviews."
2,Poorly put together DVD,"Being a big fan of Harry Potter books I really did not enjoy the movie. There were several casting errors (Maggie Smith comes to mind) but the reason for the low review is this..My 30ish sister rented the DVD to see the extra scenes. After spending an hour an a half trying to figure out where they were on the DVD she asked me to try to figure it out. After I couldn't do it (I'm the technowiz in our house) I went online to discover she had to play the game to view them. Needless to say, after all the packaging and ads screaming ""deleted scenes"" she was very disappointed. She was too burned out at this point to play the game so we returned it."
3,Nothing special.,"This movie start fairly good, but once they get to the castle it stalls out. Nothing big really happen, only isolated events. The game part of the movie just doesn't do it for me. Overall: Fair."
5,Simply Amazing,"I was never a Harry Potter fan and I never understood the craze but Ive always been one to give things the benefit of the doubt so I rented this movie...and all I could say was WOW! Two days later I bought it on VHS and have since watched it over five times. The cast was convincing, the story kept you intrested all the way until the end, the costumes and settings where incredible. Makes one wish Hogwarts really did exist. I havent read the books yet but I know Ill eventually get to reading them. Its a fantastic movie for all ages, Im 20 years old and Ill probably watch it a dozen times more. Cant wait until the next Harry Potter movie is released because this time I wont wait for it to come out on video, Ill be the first in line at the movies...besides who can resist that adorable british accent :)"
3,"Great film, difficulty in accessing the extras mar the DVD","You can read the rest of the reviews here regarding the film itself, which I found to be quite a bit of fun. However, the DVD extras leave something to be desired, since there is no way to quickly view the behind-the-scenes portions of the DVD. Instead, you are forced to play the games included on the DVD in order to view the deleted or extra material. It ends up to be incredibly clumsy and cumbersome. Why the makers of this DVD did not separate the games from the extras is beyond me. In frustration I never got to see the additional materials, which I feel are one of the main reasons for purchasing a DVD copy over a VHS one.However, the DVD version will always have better picture and sound, and from that alone I reccomend the DVD."
4,Happy Harry,"Wonderful DVD for almost all ages. This is a charming tale beautifully told. The characters are endearing and well crafted. My wife and I surprisingly watch it again and again. If it has any weaknesses it has to be the special features section. The pulsed video effect and clunky interface was disappointing. Take my advice and just skip the ""tours""."
4,"When they said ""hours of extra footage""...","When they said that there was going to be about 2 hours of extra footage...I thought that they meant that there was going ot be about 2 hours of extra scenes. The extra scenes were too short, and I KNOW that there are still more scenes that they just didn't show. This really got me angry. But I also think that this was a really good DVD. The other extra features that they had were a little boring, and some of them were un-needed. But the movie was just like it was in theaters. AWESOME!"
3,DVD is something of a ripoff,"I had high hopes for this DVD. But alas, it is lacking in most of what I expect from a good DVD version of a movie. The extra scenes require the viewer to solve a complicated ""puzzle"" in order to see them. There's no director commentary available, and very little in the way of those ""extras"" (info on special effects, for instance) that make DVDs a must. The DVD-ROM portion won't operate properly on my 2-year-old computer. In short, this DVD is pretty much a rip-off. And to top it all off, you have to buy a separate DVD to get the widescreen version. The only thing good about this DVD is that you get to see the movie on your TV set--and amazingly, it's better than in the theater. I felt a little overwhelmed by the theatrical version, but seeing it this way is just right."
3,"Entertaining, but the book is better","The Harry Potter movie is not as good as the book. Daniel Radcliffe plays a good Harry Potter, but he's too cute to be as dorky as Harry Potter is supposed to be! Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) is well-played and she suits the part. Rupert Grint does an amazing job as Ron Weasley, looking and acting the part perfectly. Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also looks and acts the part well. Most of the characters are well-played, but the book is something else and the movie is something else. You just can't get the magic of the book with the movie. My advice is see it once at the movie theatre, but don't buy the DVD. Watch it for Harry's sake only."
4,Harry Potter the Movie,I think that this movie is great!!! Except for that some of the ideas and settings in the book don't happen in the movie. But other than that I thought that it was an excellent movie. I would recamened this movie to anyone who likes mistery and whole lot of fun!!!
2,Desappointing,"It was hard at times to understand what was being said, not because of the actors' British accent, but more because of the quality of the sound.Moreover, this movie was too long, and wasn't able to substain the viewer's interest.I enjoyed the ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" movie much more."
2,Back to the Books,"If you want thrills, read the Harry Potter series. The movie did not capture my attention the way the books did. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job when she wrote the books. The movie was too dark. There was no brightness, and it seemed dull. Half of the adventure in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was lost in the creation of the movie."
1,Kindle down load error,It wasnt the movies fault it was the kindle. Download error!?! Very frustrating since we were counting on it for a road trip
2,Cheesy!,"My friends--all adults, whose intelligence I respect--really liked the movie. I thought it was so cheesy that I won't ever watch another Harry Potter film. Blech."
4,Must have for HP fans,"I may already have had the movies on their deluxe editions but this pakage blows them away, and the blu-ray is outstanding!"
5,Potter,"I purchased this for a huge potter fan. She has all the movies, plus back ups but loves this collection with the extended version and the interviews with the actors and how they did certain scenes. She watches it so much I'm afraid she will wear it out!!!!"
4,Good clean and pristine Blu Ray picture,I have both HD DVD and Blu Ray player and I chose the Blu because I liked the load times offered by the PS3. By all means the new HD encoding does wonders with the movie and is worth your investment for hours of fun.
3,Good but not great.,Well lets see here I thought it was a rather interesting movie having never read the book I probably didn't get half the stuff in it. I thought id see it to see what all the hype was about and I guess I was indifferent. It didn't blow my socks off. The effects were good. My favorite part was when they played chess against the human sized pieces. I can't help to compare it to the Lord of the Rings which was a superb movie and even better book. I find that more interesting because it is darker in nature and magic seems to be used as a means to an end not just to have for the matter of having it like it seemed to be in Potter. I Have to compare the 2 because; A) they came out very close to each other. B) Tolkien basically took fantasy to a new level and every thing after it is just trying to come close to matching it.I liked it but it did npt leave me thirsting for the sequel unlike a few other movies I saw in the past year.
4,[review],"I had read the HARRY POTTER books several times, so when I found out that a movie was coming out, I was eager to see it. I was not dissapointed at all, since it followed the book almost exactly! The plot (if you have not already read the book) is this: ... I won't tell you the rest of the plt, as it may ruin the story for you. I'd suggest reading the book first, as it helps to give some extra background information not totally clarified in the movie. The actors, a"
4,suprising,"i went to this movie at the urging of my fiance'. i took her to see it, sat back thinking this was just going to be an over-hyped kiddie flick. i was surprised to find that i actually found myself liking the movie. it wasnt as childish as i thought. Harry's fat-slob Uncle and Alan Rickman as the potions teacher made the movie. im glad i gave it a fair chance. good FX too."
3,"Great Movie, Lousy Packaging","This movie has gorgeous cinemetography. The script is light and fluffy, much like the first book of the series (like The Hobbit vs. The Lord of the Rings trilogy). I found the movie very enjoyable (4 stars).The dvd's were packaged in a cheap, cheezy paper box slipped into an even cheezier paper box (1 star). The package wasn't sealed... You have to be careful how you hold the box or the disks can fall out onto the ground. I only got the movie to add to my collection, and was very disappointed to see it come in such cheap packaging. .."
5,fantasy for children of all ages,what a great series of movies. Everything in these movies is well done even the more childish parts are watchable.
4,Hmmm,"What to say about Harry Potter? I was a critic, until I read the books, and now I love him. I liked this movie, it sticked close to the book."
4,A Somewhat Dark Family Film,"I love dark movies, or those with a dark tone to them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a PG movie that manages to deliver dark elements throughout while not compromising its rating. The result is a balanced film that reaches deep into the senses and psyche. The whole school of wizardry thing really captivates, and the story is best told through the deep British accents that were used. If I have one criticism of this film, it would be the length. At over two and a half hours, it's a tad lengthy, especially when there's some overindulgence in the length of some scenes. A two hour movie probably would've been better, though I'm not complaining too much. This film sets the stage for the rest of the series; it's a series that has at least one movie that's sure to appeal to someone. A good opening act that I recommend."
2,STINKER!,"Boy, this movie's dissapointing! The story's not good at all! the one thing about this movie that I like is the acting! Everyone says this is so cool. I got bored too easily. The Fellowship of the Rings is so much better, mainly because of its realisim. Harry Potter was FAR from serious! What a disgrace!"
3,LORD of the RINGS is far better,"Although there were moments in this film that I thought were inspired, I never really felt moved by it, whether it was sympathy for the characters, or suspense. Not a whole lot of emotion.I just read a review of LOTR and the reviewer strongly stated that ""Harry Potter"" is a better film, so I came over to ""Harry Potter"" to say, ""NO WAY! LOTR is a FAR better movie."
2,My one question- why did Jo let something like this happen?,"As much as I appreciate the *hard work* of the three stars (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint)their first time on a movie screen is not their most brilliant. Add that to a director who probably should've been someone else, and the poor author who was too busy having a life to completely take over the project, and this movie falls short. The one redeming quality is Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who is excellent in every way shape and form! Then subtract two for the two worst things: Richard Harris, who looked like he was going to die on the set; and Warner Borthers, who should die a fiery death for killing everything sacred. With a lame Quidditch scene (there ARE fouls in Quidditch) and tons of plot holes (how did Draco get detention too? Wait, where were they...? Oh never mind!) This might be something you'd rather rent, or not see at all."
1,Escape Real Life? Please!!!,"To that last kid reviewer who thinks that by watching these stupid HP movies will help you escape real life...GIVE ME A BLEEPIN'BREAK! This is sure not my idea of escaping real life, in fact getting into to these HP movies and HP books will lead you into a sheltered life. Maybe you should watch ""Everybody Loves Raymond""... Now that is great realistic entertainment, not these ridiculous Harry Potter ""Fantasized"" movies. This not a so-called hateful statement but just the truth!!! HOW 'BOUT THAT?"
1,Beware of new packaging,"This product was purchased in March, 2009 and it must hve been repackaged by the manufacturer because there is only one disc in it and there are crucial deleted scenes on the disc. Another copy was purchased from a differnet seller and the product was the same as Amazon's version. Very disappointed."
1,cheesy and corny,I don't get how they would let Hermione run off like that. Aren't they supposed to take care of her? And why couldn't they just magicly wish all muggles and bad stuff a way! And I have to say the movie was horrible! It sepperates from the book millions of miles!
1,Ok movie for kids but adults will be bored,"I was disappointed with the movie. Granted the movie wasn't made for adults, but a good movie should be able to hold the interest of both adults and children. My first problem with the movie was the stiff acting by the three leads. I especially wanted to hit the fast forward button everytime the read-headed kid tried to emote. My second problem was the direction, or lack thereof. When I heard that Chris Columbus was chosen as the director, I was skeptical that the movie would be any good. I was right. The directions had no sense of excitement to them. Given the high publicity that the movie received during the pre-production process, it was disappointing that the producers didn't come up with more talented director, screen writer and actors."
2,"Not bad, but i expected more!","Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a mixture of the book and the director's thought. When i read J.K. Rowling's biography, she said about the movie being a bit child like and that she couldn't believe what had been on the screen. the graphic's were terrible and the lighting was simply dispicable, and the actors and actresses talents went to waste. I gave this movie 2 stars because it was horrible. If i were J.K. Rowling i would be insulted by this movie. It was almost the worst movie i have ever seen. The DVD which is full of extras (including the deleted scenes) were more childish than the movie and hopefully the cosmos read this so they can realize how much of a inconcivible movie this. If i were to rate this movie in a 1-10 scale, Harry Potter will get a -1. Just one more thing to say about this oblivious movie that the computer affects were incompetent. On the VHS the ""Sorting Hat"" doesn't sing like in the theatre. -- Talyn O'Donnell (Missy)"
2,harry potter chamber of secrets,"Rented video from amazon.com because my girlfriend had never seen it. She was actually showing interest in the story when in the middle it stopped. No idea why and couldn't be fixed. Pretty sure no one is going to read this and provide a refund so I'll also ask for a personal stimulus package that will pay off my student loans, a rickenbacker 360 blue burst 6 string, and a monkey. And a case of Sierra Nevada pale ale. Go Pens."
1,problem with dvd,"I have not been able to view the entire movie...There is something wrong with the DVD. It will only play up to chapter 9 and then it stops. I have tried cleaning the machine and DVD and tried playing it in another DVD player and it still does not work>>>I would like to know how the DVD can be replaced by Amazon with one that does work.Sincerely,Lsalmon."
3,"Movie Excellent, Special Features Complicated","WARNING: the three is for the hassle of special features..not the movie itselfIf you liked the movie...Good. I assume most of you know about it, and I am not going to give you details. What I will say it that the extra features are time consuming and complicated. The deleted scenes require you to find hidden ""eastereggs"", such as clicking the key in Diagon Ally's Gingotts bank, buying a wand, going back to menu, through all sorts of hidden tasks to finally see the deleted scenes. And if you hit the wrong button...you have to start all over again. AND you must do this every time you put the DVD in to see most of the extra features. Go to dvdeastereggs.com and they will give you more explict instructions on how to accomplish these tasks. The very interactive DVD is well and good for children, but if you'e an adult, until you remember the sequeces and orders you must go through to see anything, expect to be frustrated."
1,Horrible!,All this Harry Potter jazz flat out sucks! I think we are all getting really sick and tired of hearing about Harry Potter all the time. I do agree with the other kid reviewers that depise this H. Potter stuff as well...Kudos to you!
1,boring,the movies were boring a stupid because ron looks at hermoney and she looks a him a that makes me mad because i like hermoney.i wish i was ron in the movie because so she can look at me i know it 's all acting but when i was a little kid like he kids on harry potter all the kids where my age they all hit me and beet me up.that why i hate harry potter moviesthe books get an B++++
2,extended?,"I am huge on extended versions of movies and that is one reason why I got this. About 30 minutes into it, the only ""extended"" scenes there has been are deleted scenes from the bonus feature. Why show the same thing in two sections of this release? I am disappointed with this version of the film. They should have done never before seen extended scenes."
3,disappointing compared to the books,"I was quite disappointed when I saw this movie. I saw it after The Fellowship of the Ring, which was about as close to the book as movies get, and so all of the plot changing annoyed me. And while I guess the computer animated effects couldn't be too realistic or they'd scare the smallest kiddies, I found the three-headed dog laughable.There were some positive things. I love the books, and I did find the characters and their dialogue similar. I was entertained throughout, and found the magic amazing.So the movie was entertaining and fun, though not of the highest quality."
5,Excellent.Not else to say.,I have seen the Movie in Theater as well as in DVD.It is excellent.The features provided in DVD is really good.Tour is beautiful.
4,great movie!,this movie was great! but it has deleted some parts of the book like the midnight duel and some other things but otherwise it is a great movie for the family
4,The Book is Better than the Movie,"It's a great movie for fans, even though it leaves out some important stuff from the book. I would go buy it right now if i were you."
3,mistakes,ok............... but they cut some parts out the book is way better than the movie.......sorry kids
4,And thats a slam for the adults in this fandom,"The movie - the movie is great. Chances are you've experianced Harry Potter in some way or another. The video has a few flaws here and there with the transfer - but overall it's minimal. The sound is superb.As for the extras, the box describes all the many features, but fails to mention that you can only do things once you've completed others. The dvd contains 6 extra scenes - but in order to do so - you have to play a game that is as fun as pushing blocks through a hole in the wall. Boredom and frustration sets in from the first momment. Pardon me for felling peeved that I have to WORK for my extras. As for the rest of the extras - they're boring. The wand thing is stupid and it's always the third wand. The transfigure feature is no existant. And the tour of hogwarts couldn't go any slower."
2,waste of great material and talent,"I am astounded that somebody can take such great material as Rowlings books and fabulous collection of actors and make just lie there! The special effects were adequate, and I KNOW what the actors were capable of, so who else to blame but the director? This is a film that could have really come alive, been an exciting and spectacular adventure, but instead it is wooden and dull. It is as if the director read crib notes and told everyone ""okay, this is the scene where this happens, take your positions, say these lines and for gods sake, don't act, don't so much as modulate your voice or show a facial expression, we will paste it all in later with the animation"". What a pity the rest are all being done at the same time, in the same way. If somebody took a good look at this one they would run to find a decent director/producer who had imagination and style and appreciation for the quality of the finished product."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,This movie is awesome! As for the special edition 2nd disc it is alright. It's cool to explore hogwarts but the menu is very confusing. Besides that I'd highly recommend this movie. It's mixed with comedy and fantasy. An all around great movie for the whole family.
1,Languages ERROR,"The one they send to me is not ENGLISH 5.1 EX and SPANISH 5.1 EX, it is ENGLISH and FRENCH 5.1 EX!!!!!!!!!!!NO Spanish SUBTITLES........"
3,Review,"I likd this movie. It was a little morbid for little children, but nonetheless. I think it JUST hit the point of the book. It's nice to put a face to a name, but thats really all this film did. Aside from the nice settings, this movie wasn't that great. I also have all the books and the other movie. I'm not like this avid fan of Harry Potter but I just have this thing where if I have a part of a collection, I have to have it all, for my life to be complete."
3,One of the Greatest Adaptations Ever!!,"Although one of the greatest movie adaptions ever filmed, this film is a little non-professional. Great visual effects, impressive debut from Radcliffe and intense action scenes complement this film adaptation from one of the most popular book series of all time. Despite all this however, the film also contains an absolutely terrible, worthless, in the gutter performance from Rupert Grint as Ron ( you'd think they'd be a bit more selective with the kids ) and a rather impressive but obnoxious performance from Hermione(Emma Watson). It also seemed that the filmmakers didnt know what to do with the visual effects (flying, wizardry) and were just trying to figure out where all of them went. The most significant factors from this film however are Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, the 2 most charming actors I have ever seen in a childrens flick, and anyone of any age should enjoy this film thoroughly."
2,"Great book, the movie falls short","As stated, the book is outstanding. However, the movie falls far short of the high standards of it's namesake. Instead of trying to create a movie, the director devided instead to try to film the book. The result is a movie that is very choppy, akward, and in some places seems altogether too long.Had the filmmakers attmepted to pull the main story elements from the book and create a movie surrounding them, this could have been one of the best movies of the year. Instead this movie can be hard to follow for those who've not read the book (although, by this point who hasn't read the book?).Watching this movie for the first time was an interesting experience. Watching it for the second time almost put me to sleep. This movie is great for kids and for huge fans of teh books, but it won't be gracing my collection."
5,Finally I Watched the first movie,"My mom bought me the first Harry Potter book when it first came out, I loved it and continued to read everybook since then. But I never started watching the movies until ""Goblet of Fire"" came out, I'm big on reading but not so much on movies coming from books. That being sad, I enjoyed this movie a great deal and it stayed very true to the book in my opinion. At this point everyone knows the story of Harry Potter and his beginnings so I'll skip on that. Luckily the movie jumped right into the plot, they didn't spend too much time on the his life with the Dursley's and touched on the more important scenes. The casting was done well, each of the kids were able to grasp and portray the personalities we've all read in the books, as well as the Hogwarts professors.Reading all of the books before even watching the first movie didn't take away from the excitement of watching Sorcerer's Stone. I think this movie is a great intro into a fun and exciting series of books."
1,Would you like some pablum with your treacle tart?,"This movie is a pastiche of cliches right out of almost every British childhood story from ""Tom Brown's School Days"" on. The special effects for the most part look as though they were done in the 1960s or 70s, and I've seen better make-up in old Dr. Who reruns. The muzak is worthy of the most derivative drivel by John Williams, swelling to clue the audience to the heroic bits and cloying to signal the sweeter nougat. The only sadder sign of massive cultural collapse than the popularity of this sort of cobbled together candyfloss is the number of people who think that the Harry Potter books are ""manuals for the Religion of Witchcraft.""No wonder Spam is making a comeback in Ms. Rowland's homeland. If you want some good childhood fantasy stuff, try some of Roald Dahl's old classics; he at least had some imagination, and there have been better movie adaptions from some of his books."
1,Harry Potter blu ray,I ordered Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Ultimate Edition on Blu Ray and i got a regular disc for the film not a blu ray!
1,TERRIBLE,YOU JUST CANT TELL THE STORY IN 2 HOURS READ THE BOOKS INSTEAD THE MOVIE IS AWFUL WOULNDT KILL YOU TO READ ONCE IN A WHILE
3,Just A Tad Disappointed,I have just watched The Sorcerer's Stone on ABC Family channel and there are additional scenes that are not included in this DVD. Those scenes cut from the DVD actually make the film version more closely follow the book and are important to the context of the whole story. I am so disappointed. I thought I had purchased the theatrical release of the movie. Any ideas on how to tell which is the complete movie and not just a cut-up version?
5,Harry Potter is greatness.,"I don't know what the other fellow is on about but there is nothing wrong with a special edition of Harry Potter, especially if you don't already have a copy of the Sorcerer's Stone. There's not really much that the studio can do to this movie to change it one way or another. If it is a two-sided single disc, so what? I have other movies on a two-sided disc and I find it to be very convenient. If you don't already own this movie then I suggest you buy it. Unless you desire heavy themes and truly terrible scenes then perhaps Harry Potter is for you. Most kids will love the show."
2,This movie suxored,"This movie was about as empty and plastic as a Harry Potter action figure from Burger King.The digital stunt doubles weren't convincing in the least, and the broomstick match looked like a scene from a PS2 game.Everything else looked nice, but the storyline was about as engaging as a stripped clutch. I think this movie would insult the intelligence of a fetus. They must have said the name ""Harry Potter"" with awe and reverence 6,000 times in this movie. I left the theater at about the time he was putting on the invisible cloak. It was too boring.If I have to saw something good, I'd say there were some pretty places and faces, and the invisible cloak effect was good.-- JJT"
2,Good Special Effects But Its Still Greasy Kid's Stuff,"This movie is not bad, the special effects are good and the acting is very good, kids will love it, adults will be mildly entertained. I found it to be very uninteresting and predictable in spots, not worth the money for a purchase. I hope that the books are more interesting than this movie."
2,If I wanted a child's video game . . .,"I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A CHILD'S VIDEO GAME!!!!DISK 1: 5 stars. My entire family, from 8 yr old to 46 yr old parents, loved this movie.DISK 2: ZERO STARS. When we heard this would be a 2-disk set, we had visions of behind the scenes documentaries, pieces on special effects, make up, locations used, etc. WE GET NONE OF THIS!!! JUST A FRUSTRATING, STUPID GAME!!Look at Star Wars I, Planet of the Apes: they appealed to a wide audience, and the 2 disk DVD gives us gobs of good stuff.I am horribly disappointed by this release."
5,The wonders of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"I am 12 years old, and When I first read the books I was like the bigest fan of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. My favrote book is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I hoped there would be a Movie to that? If there was I real wanted to be one of the actors. I have read all the books and have been wating for the 5th book to come out and the 2nd movie to come out. The person I thought was the best is Hermine Granger(Emma Waston.) Because, she was the smartest and cutest. If any of the actors of this movie or dractors that are reading this PLEASE try to give me a part in the seconed movie or any of the movies"
4,Surprisingly good,"First of all, my 3 year old loves this movie. The first time he saw it, he was scared a little. The monster that looks like shrek is fascinating to him and ofcourse quidditch is exactly what all little boys want to see. Flying in brooms playing sports and being a hero on the field. I read the books and I expected the movie to fall short and I was very surprised that it was good."
2,Missing Scenes,"I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the movies. I bought the DVD as soon as it was released and watched it a couple of times before loaning it out. The DVD was lost so I ordered one from Amazon. I looked forward to receiving it and was anxious to sit down and watch this much-enjoyed movie. I was sadly disappointed to note that several scenes were missing. It became apparent that the video I got from Amazon was an edited version. The Amazon description of the movie did indicate that it was an edited version. If so, I wouldn't have purchased it. I have since researched other stores and found the full length movie.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)"
4,"Despite being handled by Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves, this emerges a winner","Considering what accomplished hacks director Chris Columbus and writer Steve Kloves are, it's amazing that the first entry in the Harry Potter film adaptation is as good as it is, despite shoddy special effects.In their debuts, Daniel Radcliffe is the affable, earnest Harry, Rupert Grint is the cynical Ron, and Emma Watson is the bookish Hermione. Sadly, this is the ONLY film in the series that made any kind of effort to portray Hermione and Ron as they were meant to be, while the sequels either butchered or overblew them.Old pros like the late Richard Harris and Maggie Smith add to the charm of this engaging fantasy."
5,"Harry Potter, when is the fame going to end?","That answer may be difficult to answer. All material things have a end, and for Harry Potter I do not see it's end any time soon. I am deeply awaiting the arrival of this DVD because I am a great fan and have been waiting forever to enjoy this movie. It kept faithfull to J.K. Rowling and for that I rate it 5 stars. The production might not have been very good to everyone's eyes, but I held it accounted because the movie was faithfull to the book, if it was made into a 'Hollywood Version' perhaps the production would have been better, but fans everywhere including myself would have left disappointed. So over all I think that the movie was great, gave fans a in depth look at the Magival World of Harry Potter for the many years that we have been dreaming about."
4,Special features--ho hum,"I was disappointed by the special features bonus dvd in this set. The games are overly simple once you can figure out how to navigate by selecting the item covered by sparkles. The tour of Hogwarts seemed distorted, slow and choppy. The seven bonus scenes were mildly interesting, certainly not worth all the effort to get to them. [Hint: Go to classrooms, click on podium supporting the fire. Continue through a few more obstacles, you'll then be taken to hallway with portraits that include the scenes.]I would have also liked to have seen interviews with the cast in addition to the 15 minutes with the directors. The packaging is flimsy. I don't think the cardboard will hold up to the use it will be getting.All that said, I loved the movie almost as much as I love the books."
2,OK... but disapointing,"When I went to the Movie theater on the first day of opening I was expecting to have just the amazing-est 2hours and a half of my life. Instead, I stood up few times, got myself coke and hotdogs, (which are expensive) and impatient that nothing in ME moved. When I came home, I re-read the book, and discovered what was lacking-- the display of emotions and humor that packs the pages in the book. Like when Harry invisions himself as the game-keeper assistance after being expelled from Hogwarts. Like when Hermione flings herself to Harry, and says ""You're a great wizard."" Not to mention all the songs and funny verses that was in the book. I believe if they did an arousing ""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy, warty, Hogwarts"" Like in the book, with a charming tune to it, it would have been so much better. No songs to remember, no place to really laugh, and no place to really cry, makes a not-so-good movie, in my opinion. Yes, the picture was great, but I value the content, not the outside."
4,Great Adaptation of the Book!,"I thought that this movie did a great job bringing the novel to life. Actually seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts was great! However, as I have found in the past, books are almost always better than the movie, and this is no exception. Although the movie was great...the book was so much better. There are just so many more intricate details in the book that you just don't get in the movie...hence the 4 stars. All together a great movie, and a must see for any Harry Potter fan!"
5,I Was not a Harry Potter Fan.................At first,"I was not interested in becoming a Harry Potter fan. I fought hard against it! A friend of mine badgered me into seeing it. All she could talk about was Harry this and Harry that. So to shut her up I agreed to see it. I LOVED IT!!!!!!! From the moment the movie started to the end credits, I was engrossed in what adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione would have next! (I did not care for the Dursley's at all!!)After seeing this movie, ALL I could talk about was Harry this and Harry that! Talk about a change of heart! Rush out and buy the DVD version today!!! Play the game to see the deleted scenes. Have a ball with Harry and his friends! To anyone who has not read the books, I would recommend those also!"
3,My view on the Harry Potter Movie,I thought the movie of Harry Potter was great... BUT not anywhere near as great as the book!! The movie had a character that wasn't even in the book and a lot of the text in the book was left out of the movie. I would recommend the watching the movie AFTER reading the book.
3,It's Ok....,"I saw ""Harry Potter"" the first day it was out. Yes, I thought it was good, mm-hmm, everything was good, yadda yadda...That is, until I saw Lord of the Rings. (LOTR)With the fantastic job that Peter Jackson did on LOTR, I began to realize just how disappointed I was with Harry Potter. I thought there were lovely little touches and some good acting in HP, but the scene with Quirrel and Voldemort, the climax, was slightly disapointing. Wasn't Quirrel supposed to be burning, and not crumbling? Yeah, I know; ""the burning would scare the little kids."" I would know as well as anybody: after all, I have a friend in second grade who would be scared by it. But still... Well, that wasn't the main problem ( I s'pose I'm just complaining). The troll DID NOT FIT. He was just a bit too unreaistic (but, hey, I guess that would be too scary for the little kids too! But don't get me wrong: I woulda been scared by somethin' like that if I was little.) Well it's OK: entertaining, but not entralling."
3,"Visually cool, but the book is better","This is a visually beautiful movie, even though I thought the book was much better. That's what your imagination can do for you."
3,"Ok, but...","The movie wasn't bad, but the book was so much better. I realize they had to cut a lot out to even get the movie to how long it is now, but it lost a lot in the translation. Especially with character development. Take Dumbledore: in the book, he comes across as a very wise, but eccentric, colorful old man. In the movie, he just comes across as a boring old man. Also, I think the movie was in some places a little more scary and graphic than it needed to be (like the scene of Harry's parents' deaths.) The movie stuck very closely with the particulars of the book, but it kind of lost the spirit. On the good side, the casting was excellent (the Dursleys, Ron, and Hermione, in particular), the Quidditch match was awesome, and the special effects were, for the most part, really good (except for the centaur. He was AWFUL!!) So this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. But for all those who saw the movie but haven't read the book: Don't judge a book by its movie!!"
2,Not what they made it out to be....,"This particular movie was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year,along with Wet Hot American Summer, and The Princess Diaries. Now, im not the biggest Harry Potter fan, though I have read all of J.K.'s books (but only half of the fourth, snore!), but I still expected better. It just wasn't that great, neither was the acting. People are writing these five star reviews not out of opinon, but rather out of deniel.Im not saying it was the worst movie ever, I just wouldint go out buying it, or claming it was one of the years ""best films""...I dont know if I would have liked it more or less if I hadnt read the book first, because the fact that they cut out scenes really didnt bother me as much as it did with others. It's more like a ""Thumbs Up"" film rather than a ""Two Thumbs Up"" one..."
2,Disappointment...The book was much better,"I a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and really looked forward to seeing the first book on the big screen. Unfortunately, as is true with most movies based on a book, it didn't live up to what I expected. It was fun to see a few things that I had imaged in my minds eye while reading on the big screen, but I guess I just expected SOOO much more. Maybe the next one will be better. I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
3,OK,"Because this movie was made while the book was still being widely read, it had to stay true to the original. Where the special effects were amazing, it stayed true to the original to a T and failed to add anything to the story. It lost the magic of the prose because it was too afraid to add any of the magic of movies besides special effects."
2,BUY THE BOOKS INSTEAD,"The book is 100000 times better. The movie cut or modified over 75% of the plotline(Snapes Questions, Peeves, having a wands, midnight duel, second Quiddich Match, conversation between hagrid...)THE BOOKS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!(I am a harry potter fan)I hope Chris Culumbus would do better next time.Lord of the Ring fans,DO NOT dismiss the book because of this junk, HARRY POTTER BOOK IS MUCH BETTER(a thousand times better)THAN THE MOVIE!!from a Harry Potter Fan"
2,"Disc is fine up until the 2 hour point, then it skips and does not finish",The disc is defective and does not finish. It will not work after the 2 hour point. We just tried to watch this after purchasing it in December and are very disappointed we didn't do it sooner so we could return it. This is a defective product after it was guaranteed it would work.
5,Great,I bought this used which is what I buy all the time and never have any trouble. Good quality. I would buy again.
2,Nice try.....,"I loved the books, but this movie totally ruined them. While I liked the plot and characters, the acting was horrible! It looked like they just picked any kid off the street and offered them a job....no doubt they actually did that. I went to the movie opening day and paid... to see it, what a mistake!..."
3,Let down by the animations,"The film is great, the actors fantastic but I feel given the budget of this movie that it was let down by the animations of the Quidditch game and the troll scene. Given the technology we have seen in the matrix, Star Wars and Lord of The Rings I think they could have done a lot better.Sticks close to the book, which is unusally good to screenHaving said all that it is still well worth watching, and I will be getting a DVD for my HP mad girlfriend."
3,Buyers Beware! This is good for one time only!,"I watched this movie for once and I couldn't watch it anymore. When I tried to watch the 2nd time, it just got so boring and I almost felt asleep. Sure this movie was interesting at first and especially appealing to children but the story is just too strange and childish. Maybe the Harry Potter diehard fan and children might enjoy it more, but certainly any adult with some senses would agree with me. I would only recommend it to people who might be interested to get to know what this popular wizard Harry Potter is all about without reading the books. This movie might give them some ideas. But I certainly would suggest to rent it on video only, don't waste your money and anymore time with this one. So buyers beware!"
2,Disappointing,Why O Why cant hollywood just leave a good book alone. Finally kids were starting to read again. Old and young alike love the Harry Potter series. Many fans are awaiting the 5th book. But no it has been delaying pending the 2nd Harry Potter movie. Not only did this movie leave out characters (peeves) and changed the ending of the movie completely (i wont go into details) it also took a book and turned it into another movie for youngsters to watch instead of reading the book. The book is definately better. Tolken goes into such good detail it could never be made as good in Hollywood and i was dissappoined they even tried. However if you never read the book and never will (a very bad choice in my opinion) is this movie is fine it has a good plot and characters and some of the special effects are cool (I like the candles floating). BUT READ THE BOOK INSTEAD ITS MUCH BETTER.
2,compared to the book.. .,"this was a good movie. however if you are looking for an excellent companion for the book, this is not it. the book is so much better than this adaption of the movie, that it makes the movie look terrible in comparison. too much of important character elements were left out in order for certain jokes to make sense to anybody other than those that had read the book. when i walked out of the theater i was thoroughly disapointed by the fact that if you hadnt read the book, there wouldve been no way to understand the movie. this movie in itself had good special effects but when compared to the masterful effects written by j.k. rowling, they look pathetic. if you are a die hard fan of the book, i do not reccommend the movie"
2,not that great,This movie is very good if you haven't read the book. While staying somewhat true to the book i was disappointed.i felt it left out or changed some of the best parts of the book and leaves out some major details from the book.
3,A disappointment,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and needless to say I was eagerly waiting for the movie to come out. When I finally saw it, I thought it was great. The second time I saw it, I was disappointed. I understood why they had altered the book so they could produce it easier, but some of the scenes I didn't understand why they took them out. For example; Snape's spell(?I don't know what to call it). Why was that taken out?The actors were very good, and I think they did a wonderful job, so I'm not taking anything away from them, but I think overall the movie does not have the charm the book does. I will still be seeing the second movie, but I will not be hoping for as much. Some times people make mistakes in turning a book into a film, and I think this was one of those times."
4,Potter DVD disappoints (grownups),"The fact that my seven year old son sat stone still, staring at the screen for two and a half hours is testimony to this movie. Truly a very good adaptation of the novel (for my money, a little too true to the book).The DVD brings Harry Potter home, and while the transfer is very good (I bought, and can only recommend, the widescreen version), I found the second disc frustrating. I still haven't reached the hidden deleted scenes, and their just isn't enough stuff for movie buffs or, for that matter, grown up fans of the books.Even my son, who was so caught up in the movie in the theatre, doesn't seem to have the patience or desire to wade through all this. I'm disappointed that a movie that was so popular with adults as well as children would aim the DVD squarely at the younger set (who don't seem to care anyway)."
4,"Okay, I'll admit it - I wish there was really a Hogwart's.","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible - but I was instantly whisked away into the fantasy world of Harry Potter. After seeing the movie, I read all the books, and am, whether I like it or not, a fan of the HP series.The DVD is great - there's lots of extras that you'll enjoy finding. I'm still discovering new bits myself!If you liked the books, this is a very good representation - very true to the story. And, it's great for adults and kids, though it might be a bit scary for very young children."
5,A great story,"Finally a movie that shows in a great way the story of a so sold book....I like very much the whole saga so that I waited for this movie since i began reading: well i'm waiting for the second now.I advise the DVD not to the kids only(you can also read the books to your kids etc) , cause it's a story that makes you dream and it's, in my opinion, a very nice escape to everyday's life...."
1,It really deserves 2 stars but...,"...I felt I had to balance out all the 5 star ratings. I admit the movie has some appeal because of the charming concept as well as the atmosphere established by the sets and the score. However, the movie pretty much fails in most other aspects. None of the jokes are funny. The editing and camera-work seem choppy and the delivery of the plot is often corny. Many scenes are overdone, especially the quiditch scenes. Worst of all, Harry seemed to me a totally unsympathetic character. He smiled at all the wrong moments and generally uninspired."
1,Wiener,Harry Potter is such a wiener. If he wasn't so talented he wouldn't have a girlfriend.I give this movie a 1 out of a possible 5 stars. I wouldn't give him any stars but he's so damn talented.
1,One craze that makes no sense to me,"My nephew has this and I can't for the life of me understand this craze. The film isn't as good as Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, or even Bedknobs and Broomsticks, for that matter."
1,"If not for the heckling, I would have snored.","What should have been a light hearted, whimiscal children's movie becomes an over drawn tale of boredom and eye candy. The major problem is that the director treats his material like Lord of the Rings when it is much closer to Cat in the Hat. Instead of telling a story and giving children a new idea for playtime, every little detail of is spelled out for us. This is not a rich and fully developed world, however, and the more we're shown, the less it is believable. Two and a half hours of film wasted."
1,Completely Awful.,"This was a very terrible movie.After a bunch of horrible books,out comes a horrible movie from the Harry Potter series.I will not watch this junk,will not support this junk,and will not stand this junk.If you like to watch good movies,then this movie is definitely not for you.However,if you enjoy completely awful movies,then be sure to add Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to your DVD(or video)collection.Peace Out."
3,blows goats,I aint really into magic and wonds moving around..doesnt really pump my nands alot....to much of a kid movie....only got 3 stars becuase of the speacil affects were really good
4,Great movie! Tedious Special Features.,"The movie adaptation of JK Rowling's wonderful Harry Potter books was wonderful. Yes, there were some deleted scenes, but overall, their absence did not detract from the plot. Books will always be better than their movie adaptations, regardless of who wrote them. I have yet to see a 100% true adaptation that was entertaining.One of my favorite parts of owning a DVD player is seeing the deleted scenes. In order to get the scenes for the Sorcerer's stone, though, you had to go through a series of ""visits"" to Diagon Alley, Hogwarts grounds, & classrooms. While, theoretically, this would be fun, in reality, it was way too much to go through in order to get a paltry extra 10 minutes of footage.It was a worthwhile buy, though, and I'll watch & rewatch it for years to come."
2,DVD missing scenes!!!,"I am most distressed to find that the ""Widescreen Special Edition"" DVD I purchased is missing numerous small scenes-scenes that are integral to understanding the story!!I have also noticed missing scenes in both the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which are ""Special Editions"" as well.I, for one, will purchase no more Harry Potter DVD's until this practice stops. I am quite disgusted with the Harry Potter marketers and producers--I feel that I have been cheated out of my money.When JK Rowling et al begin selling unabridged products, I will consider purchasing her movies again.The movies themselves are good; the DVD's are an outright rip-off.BUYER BEWARE!!!Disappointed fan"
1,dissappointed,The movie took way too long to arrive at my residence. when they say it might take as long as a month it will! I honestly dont know why something getting shipped normal mail takes an entire month!! I have ordered things from other sellers on here and it only took 3 to five days. I will never order through media thrill again!!!!!!!
2,yeah,"Yeah, when I was watching this movie I fell asleep, I woke up 10 minutes later and fell asleep again and just to think that before watching this movie I had a really good night sleep, I guess with this movie it doesn't matter. Works better than a sleeping pills, don't watch it more than once, danger of not waking up. No wonder they included toy with the movie, so you won't get bored watching it, at least something exiting. The reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because when I fell asleep I had a nice erotic dream..."
5,Classic for a new generation,"My 11-year old daughter and I both have been reading the series of Harry Potter books. We saw this movie in the theaters and we both loved it. It was one of those movies that we just had to keep talking about long after it was over. Of course, as soon as the DVD came out, we had to have it!It is, in my opinion, one of the very few movies that actually holds true to the book. The cast and movie direction - it's look and feel - are right on! Everything in the movie is how we imagined it while reading the book. An excellent movie for kids and adults alike."
4,Nice DVD,My daughter complained about this movie because it wasn't EXACTLY like the book. I found it to be a fun movie from start to finish. Nice DVD package with lots to do.
4,GREAT FUN FOR THE READER/VIEWER,"This was great fun for the viewer who has read the books. Can't wait for the remainder of the movies to be released. For those who say that HARRY POTTER is evil, I say: get a life, get a grip, get an education, hide your ignorance and quit spreading your religio-cult fanatic fantasies around to simply scare others because you are too terrified to live life in the actual real world."
5,Simply Magical !,"What can one say about one of the biggest BlockBuster of 2001 ?Let me tell you this.........Spellbound, simply Magical, and always refreshing."
4,I Enjoyed Harry Potter,"I was real reluctant to go see this movie. My husband sort of made me but in the end I was really suprised and glad that I seen it. It was a harmless adventuress kind of movie. I have heard many things about this film. It was said that this movie is filled with witchcraft and it is true that magic and witches are in this film, but nothing too suggestive or eerie. My son is 7months but I think he may enjoy this film when he turn 3 or so. Its cute and Harry Potter is a cutie too. One Love"
4,Harry Potter 1 on HD DVD,"Good Movie, The transfer is not perfect like I hoped. It is good but you do see video noise in dark scenes and even in bright scenes on a large HDTV. in comparison, Phantom of the opera was mostly night scenes and indoors but had a perfect picture"
2,Stick with the books,"I, like most other people who have read the Harry Potter books loved them, their imagination, their unpredictability and their originality. This film however, with the exeption of one or two scenes (such as the very well done quidditch scene), is nowhere near the quality of any of the books, even though some of the actors do in fact look as their characters are meant to, not many of the actors can actually act very well in my opinion and often seem false. Mind you with books like the Harry Potter series, your imagination and the picture you have in your mind will always be much better than what they can show on the screen, therefore stick with the books!"
2,Not as expected,"I have waited for ths for a long time. I thought that the DVD would be much more advanced in flavor than expected. They made such a big deal and it didn't even have a special look at the second movie. I paid extra money just to get it on the ""Special"" DVD."
3,Not my favorite.,"I really wanted to like this, I really did. I didn't. It just seemed too easy and simple, both in plot and in general. I know it is a pin-stone for this generation, but that only proves me more to be a dinosaur. (Extra added bonus if you can tell me where that metaphor came from. Hint: from the author who wrote the books which trained me to like fantasy fiction.)"
4,Not the books...,"Do yourself a favour and see the movies before the books.They are not bad in their own right, but if you see the movie first, you'll be impressed twice because the ante is upped."
1,Special features were not worth the effort!,"I looked forward to this DVD being released ever since the movie was released in theaters because I could not wait to see the deleted scenes. When I first got the DVD and tried to find them, lo and behold I couldn't. Ater fooling around for more than 2 hours on the second disc, I had to cheat and go to the Harry Potter website to find the key. How disappointing! I am an adult who is a huge fan of the books, and I loved the movie. However, having to go through that rigamorole, made me furious and frustrated, and it was just for 7 scenes, come on! I hope Warner Bros does a more satisfactory job with the next movie and keeps in mind that most adults do not have the patience for this kind of nonsense. They need to remember that adults are the ones who normally DO the buying."
2,Poor version,"This is a poor quality reproduction, not much better than DVD quality. Really disappointing I thought. I hope they've improved it since I bought my copy."
5,Wonderful Story and Wonderful Actors,"Can't believe I had to wait until now the watch the best entertainment in history. The story line, actors, screen play is just fantastic. Haven't been this entertained in years."
3,Doesn't live up to the book...,"I thought the movie was a bit disappointing. The only reason I knew what the plot was is because I read the book. However, my friends who have not read the book didn't have any idea what was going on in the movie. I gave it three stars because the intricate scenery and the awesome magical effects. All in all, if you're looking for really intricate scenery and a sleepy plot, this is for you."
3,Nice show wasted.,"I have never read the novel and don't know what to expect when I first watched it. When the show ended, the first thing came to my mind is:""that is it?"". I am quite disappointed with the whole story especially the ending. But a friend of my said this movie followed exactly after the story of the novel. No wonder. This show has what the novel readers want, but loses the cinematic effect."
2,"You're kidding me, right?","I love these books...I can read them in a night, and I have done so at least 5 times with each. But seriously, this movie [disappointed]! The choice of actors was very agreeable, but the movie was too condensed. Humor, depth and spirit was lost as the director tried to stick play by play to the plot. It is not the plot of Harry Potter that makes it so good...its the interactions between the characters, their dialogue and friendship. The movie ignored that. Special effects just made me laugh; the troll was so bad. The movie actually bored me to death. This is no masterpiece!"
4,good flick,I thought this was a good beginning to the Potter series. Here you are introduced to Harry and his life and how he ended up in magic school. It not a movie for younger kids but for older kids it's entertaining and fun.
3,"not up my alley, but very true to the book!","I just don't personally care for the harry potter series. but my sister a die hard harry potter fan, says this movie is true! i thought the acting was horrible... but, as far as following the series, this movie hits it on the nose. brings all those cool things from the book and makes them a reality, i just couldn't bring myself to give the 4th star..."
5,A Great Film!,"I remember when the Harry Potter craze first broke out. I couldn't understand why everyone was going so wild over the books. It wasn't until I watched ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" that I became a Harry Potter fan. After watching this fun and whimsical movie, I immediately went out and bought the books. I fell in love with the books just as much as I loved the movie! It made me realize that you don't have to be a child to love this series.I loved everything about this movie, especially the casting. I don't think the characters could have been cast any better. Even though the movie is close to three hours long, it doesn't feel like it because you truly get caught up in the story and the characters.Anyone who wants to watch a film full of fantasy and fun, watch this movie! You will not be disappointed!!!!"
3,"LOVE the book, movie was OK","I saw the movie before ever reading a single book. I liked it I supposed, but it was just OK. After reading the book, I did find that the movie was pretty much spot on in regards to translating it from book to screen. The characters were perfectly cast I thought and I loved the score. I am still a huge HP fan regardless so I will watch this movie again and again if I happened to catch it on TV."
5,This is my FAVORITE Harry Potter film!,"I love all the mystery and wonder of the FIRST YEAR at Hogwart's, all the introductions of the characters in this new world, and seeing Harry's reactions to the magic he can do! After all the films (so far up to the Order of the Phoenix) this one is STILL my favorite! Wonderful!"
1,Warning! Digital Copy Expired - can't renew!,"Please be warned - the digital copy for this Harry Potter bluray set expired on Dec 8th 2010. The digital copy apparently was only a promotional feature with a limited offering. I only found this out after purchasing this item. It is displayed in the package insert's fine print. I contacted customer service for both Amazon and Warner Brothers, but they will not or cannot renew the code for the digital copy. I now have to go through the hassle to return this item. I was very disappointed with this purchase!"
2,THE MOVIE IS OK. THE BOOK IS GREAT!!,"THE MOVIE SOUNDS REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT IT OR SEE THE PREVIEW BUT IT'S NOT THAT GOOD.THE BOY WHO PLAYED HARRY POTTER IS A REALLY BAD ACTOR. IT SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T TRY VERY HARD.THEY CUT ALOT OUT OF THE BOOK TO MAKE THE MOVIE AND THAT'S ADISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME:)IN THE MOVIE THEY TOOK LINES FROM THE BOOK AND PUT THEM IN THE WRONG PLACES BECAUSE THEY CUT SO MUCH OUT.THIS MOVIE IS NOT BAD, BUT NOT REALLY GOOD EITHER, SO YOU LIKE IT OR YOU HATE IT.RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!!!I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEBODY!..."
3,Lord of The Rings was better (sorry Columbus),"Well, over two huge movies that I have viewed over the late-fall-early winter time, which were this and Lord of the Rings, I would have to say Lord of the Rings was better: More action and thrills than this movie (and the time they spend in classes are so boring in HP.) So, even though this movie was better than The Road to El Dorado (I warn you) I think that you should not go see it even if you are handling extreme urgency.... But back to the subject of Harry Potter. This movie is one I recommend skipping. I was waiting for the end in the boring parts, and the end wasn't even that satisfactory! A great scene, though, with ample amounts of detail, was the Quidditch match. Otherwise..."
2,A Kid's Movie,"I found it very difficult to get through this movie in one sitting. The plot and dialogue are substantially watered down to the point where my guess is that the movie only truly appeals to those under 14. Nice special effcts, virtually no plot, and a script written on an elementary school level."
2,FAN - TASY............,"TWO [marginal] stars! Yet another misplaced Luke Skywalker clone-type saga - will it never end? AND just where is the originality? A totally unrealistic fantasy about 'boarding-school'!Some of the 'effects' throw us straight into Great George Pal territory! Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.Maggie Smith, Richard Harris [Camelot's misplaced Merlin?] could have phoned their performances in!The best thing of all? ALAN RICKMAN! Says more with just a glance.....Only IF you must....."
5,Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,I think the dvd was amazing. i loved the special features and the actual dvd was wonderful. it capured the magical spirit better than the theater did. i loved the surprises and adventures. i can't wait for the second movie to come out on dvd. i saw it in theaters and it was even better than the first one.
4,Too Long!,"I really did not like the book. I did, however, enjoy the film. There is something to be said for a film that stays true to the material on which it is based, and this film is very faithful to the book. There is also something to be said for a film that manages to be as good or better than the material on which it is based. So why only 4 stars out of 5? The film is simply too long ... it could have been cut by 15-30min. Other than that, no complaints whatsoever, and that is coming from someone who did not like the book."
4,I Can Stand To Watch It A Few Times.,"This is a miracle. I can watch a movie four times without getting bored. The book to script conversion is masterfully done, with the right changes needed. The special features don't go overboard, either, but they have enough to fulfill Potter's legions of fans.Is there a downside? Maybe the movie drags on at times and seems a little outside of even magical reality, but Rowling can push the envelope and still pull it off.The acting is decent enough, the effects are well done, the plot is incredible, and the entire thing is well carried out. ""We expect great things from you, Harry Potter"". Don't blow it come Chamber of Secrets.B+"
5,One of my Favorite Movies,"I had never read any of the Harry Potter books before seeing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I was enchanted by the story and the film in general. I bought and read all the Harry Potter books within the next week.I have seen the movie eleven times. The movie follows the book fairly well. There are some minor differences between the book and the movie and some things in the book just didn't make it into the film. Peeves the Poltergist is probably the biggest thing missing from the movie. However, the spirit of the book shines through.I thought the movie was cast very well. The special effects are wonderful and not overdone."
5,Coooooooooooool Movie,this movie is great for everyone all over the world!this movie is especially great for BIG harry potter fans like me! this movie is the first out of 7 movies. the movie is so much alike the book. it's the beginning of harry's wizard training. the actors are great! very much alike the characters of the book. the movie starts with the beating of lord voldemort. he the lives with his aunt and uncle. then he finds out he's a wizard from Hagrid. he then begins his training sorted into gryfindor. he then finds himself face-to-face to lord voldemort is a great movie and we should all see it
3,Okay,I never read the book but as a movie there are promblems with its translation to screen. While the story is basically good the exposition takes a really long time. By the time you get to the main conflict it feels somewhat thrown in and resolved quickly. Unfortunately the movie was marketed to fans of the book who are mostly too young to sit through a movie longer than 2 hours. Harry Potter probably needed about 3 hours or a more efficiant filmaker. It seems like they wanted to include everything from the books opening but ran out of alotted time or money when the conflict arose.
5,Superior FAMILY Movie,"I am a 41 year mother of a 9 year old son and we both loved this movie!!! I can personally say that I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out. We saw it at the movies ""3"" times!!! Yes, it is that good!!! I read the book along with my son and I can honestly say this, the movie was EXACTLY like the book. The actors all did a fantastic job! I wish that I could say who was the best but they really were all that good. I was surprised that it didn't get any Oscar nominations. It is definitely a warm hearted movie with supsense and drama mixed in. Buy the movie, get some popcorn, your family and friends and enjoy a great family evening together."
3,New or old?,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: An amazing book! Most of the country, and a large percent of the world has read it. Perhaps thats what took away from the movie, that I knew what was around every corner. Oh, its not that the actual movie is bad, its just that so many people are familiar with the story already that it doesn't really have the same affect as if you had never heard the plot before. Using actual places, and incredible graphics to illistrate the story in a realistic way doesn't even begin to compare to our imagination. If you haven't already seen it i suggest that you rent it first, because by the second time you see it there is no surprise."
5,Harry Potter ande the Sorcerer's stone,this movie goes with my starting collection of umd movies and was delivered as promised
2,No Features Here Folks,"The long awaited Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone movie was well worth the wait. Sad to say, however, that the long awaited DVD was not. The Special Features amount to ""theatrical trailers."" Which is sad for a 2 disk set. I personally found the 2nd disk's ""game"" (which is what Disk 2 is) annoying. Unless you did everything right, you would not be allowed to advance. I can understand that the filmakers wanted to ""expand"" the harry potter world, and let kids roam freely. In which case why not make a PC game instead? why waste your money on making a DVD game, instead of providing the special features we have all come to expect and enjoy from DVD's? The only good thing about it is a 15min Interview with the filmakers which provides very little into the making of the movie. If you ask me, you're better off buying the Widescreen VHS or something than to waste your money on a 2 disk set with no features."
5,"Excellent, A sure classic.","This movie was entertaining, exciting, and just plain wonderful. Of special note; my grandson, who is a Harry Potter expert, could only find two or three deviations from the book. We went to the film as a family, Granddad, Grandmother, Dad, Mom, Son, Daughter, and Aunt. All 7 of us were delighted. It rate at the top, along with classics such as Wizard of OZ, Tales of Narnia, and Lord of the Rings. Hooray for such a delightful family film."
3,forget the digital copy...,"The movie isn't really that much different from the extended version. The box is kind of nice, but unless you have it out where people can see, what does that matter?I got this for two reasons: 1) It was supposed to have lots of new scenes, and 2) the digital copy.The ""new scenes"" are okay. Most seem to be the deleted scenes and such from other versions of the movie I already had.The digital copy is a bust. I received the DVDs on the very day they expired, but the system still would not let me download them. I emailed customer service, and got a completely unsatisfactory answer. Basically, if you want their digital copy, don't count on them to give it to you. I now had a useless DVD in a pretty box sitting on a shelf where nobody can see it unless they to looking for it.Was it worth the money? Probably not. Unless, that is, you feel like you have to collect everything. But don't think you are getting a ""deal"" when you get it."
2,Did the writers even read the book?,There are so many differences between the movie and book that the movie doesn't follow the book. It would be nice if some of the film followed the storyline of the book. They changed the book around so much that I'm not even sure that the movie is based on the same book I read so many times and enjoyed reading. The graphics were wonderfull but it doesn't diminish the fact that they couldn't bother to follow the book and the actions of the characters involved.
3,stupid people,"this is for all the people who wrote really bad reviews for Harry Potter. a lot of you had appalling spelling mistakes in your reviews, and i think rather than criticizing Harry Potter you should go and learn to spell. as for the movie it was pretty good. it could definitely have been better, and funnier, and i am mad at Harry for having blue eyes rather than green, but it was still OK."
1,A very annoying DVD set - Harry deserved better!,"I loved the books. I loved the movie. My kid was rivited to the seat during the entire thing. Then we tried to find the Never-Before-Seen footage that's supposed to be part of the package. Let me warn you - thus far I've been unable to find any trace of the Never-Before-Seen footage on either of the DVD's in the set. It's just not there. There's no menu item pointing to it, and there's no indication of that content being on CD2 either. If your hopes are up on seeing that extra footage, this DVD is not for you. My son is very disappointed. This disc contains no movie previews for other features and strangely enough, it lacks the FBI copyright message as well. If you like to collect movies and want to add Harry to your collection, I'd advise waiting until WB updates the disk menus and includes the features they've left out."
2,If you read the book dont watch the movie,I am a big fan of Harry Potter books. I read them at least 4 times ( each book). I was very disapponted when I watched the movie. It didnt have the same magic as the book. First of all the important events were not in the movie. They made mistakes while transferring the scenes from the book to the movie. I went to see it with my friend who also is a big fan and she also didnt like the movie. The book is for evryone for all ages but the movie is just for kids. I can recommened the movie if you didnt read the book but if you know the book you will not like the movie.
4,Great movie.,"I am a fan of the books and enjoyed this movie a lot. Few things were left out of the book and I thought the casting was all dead on.The movie part of the DVD is spectacular. Great crisp video and audio. The only complaint I have is that the special features on the DVD are for kids only. I didn't get any real enjoyment out of them, but I guess being 26 years old I wasn't the target audience and it's only a minor inconvience.Would have absolutely loved a commentary with the actors that played Harry, Ron and Hemione but still the DVD was a great value."
4,Good Movie...,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan!! Being 21 years old, I never thought I would write those words! I really love these books and the movie is great too. My only advice is...I loved the books so much that the movie wasn't all that I wanted it to be (altough it is still wonderful).Surely a movie that you should watch. Try the books too! YOU WILL LOVE THEM!"
4,Can I see it again,i love this movie the reason though i give it 4 stars is becausethey left two main parts at the ending and the middle but it was great ps read the books their also great. First when Harry didnt know he was a wizard he had a horrible life but soon he was in the spell of magic AS always expected Harry was so magical. Youngest wizard soccer player and other things make Harry great if the added one part at the end that they took off i could gladly give it a 100 stars (5 stars now!) but from two left out sceans i must give it four but it should be 5 a wonderful movie you can't not miss it if you do your missing a year a wizardry!
2,Could have been a lot better,I have read the book at least ten times so I know most of the sayings. Let me tell you there were probaly 5 sayings identical to the book. It had half edited scenes which became annoying and it added goofy scenes which made no point. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because some of the scenes were pretty cool.
3,Good but not Great,"This movie was great! The only problem was it wasn't as good as the books. I think the books are better than the movie. I think the books were fantastic, marvelous, ect... One thing I noticed was they didn't include snapes task in the movie. I thought that was wierd.I loved this movie! Pre-order it today!"
3,Well I read the book of Harry Potter 1 and well I was dieing to see the movie,This movie was filled with magic wow. It was cool but weird.
2,""" turn this stupid fat rat yellow""","I first heard of Harry Potter when I was in class one day when I heard about H.P. My dad ordered the 1st 4 books and I said (at first by the way!) that i didn't want them. I hate turning down gifts though... Then that faithful day happened, I heard about Harry Potter and the Sorseror's Stone. Then I read all of the books out so far. Then I was hooked. Then They said a movie about the first book was in production. I saw the trailers, didn't need spoilers, I read the book. I couldn't see it in theatures. It came out on video and I saw it. I was thouroghly disappointed that they left Peeves out, and made Hermione a smart-@$$ know-it-all. But don't let that remark fool you, I was making a statment. Anyway Quiddich was awesome, Snapes acting sucked, he sounded like some 60's hippe who just discovered crack... The end was also a downer when there was only 2 things protecting the stone, not 4. Well maybe the rest won't be not-so-good. Avereage movie, not aweful."
2,U N E N G A G I N G,"I usually get caught up in fantasy-style children's fare but this one just didn't have me caring one bit. All the parts are there ... maybe everything just has too much Hollywood ""shine"" to it. I probably shouldn't even offer an attempt at an objective review since Lord of the Rings made me completely forget I ever wanted to experience Potter in the first place."
3,The lost explaination.,"There is a line included in the cable version of this movie that explains why the know-it-all Hermione is bonded to the male pair of protagonists. I have searched, bought and thrown away more of this movie than any other I have ever bought. In spite of your boast that you included seven new scenes in this movie, the simple line, after the troll incident, was not included."
1,forget the digital copy,"The one star rating isn't for the movie - it's for the packaging. Just bought this for Christmas for my 9 year old. One of the main reasons for investing in a second copy was the digital versio n for her laptop. Well, you can't tell from the box or the web page, but that expired Dec. 8th so it is completely worthless."
3,harry Potter intro,Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is a pleasant introduction to the team of actors who have grown up in this series of films. This isn't one of the better films in this series because Chris Columbus has done a pedestrian job as the director - he created a film about magic that simply lacks the magic of later entries in this series. The best thing about this film is the cast.
1,DVD [is bad] - Buy the Video,"I got the DVD for the special features. But you have to spend close to 45 minutes jumping through hoops to see them. Who's idea was this? What's wrong with the way everyone else does it? Just make a button titled ""Deleted Scenes"". I'm planning on returning the DVD to the store I purchased it from and getting the video. Unless you have 45 minutes to waste on stuff, get the video."
1,BAd DVD design,"You have to play the games to see the deleted scenes. If you are wanting to see the deleted scenes hers how.to get tothe stone, you have to get your wand from diagon alley, go to the classrooms, highlight the owls and the H on the middle brazier, then head into the room with fluffyfrom there is the steps to get to the stone from the book ... you have to select the right 'key' fairy, then select the right bottle, then you have the stoneits the middle key fairy, and the yellow bottle"
1,The movie was okay... but the DVD...,"For me the Harry Potter movie was pretty good, but the DVD was horriblE! The only good special features were deleted scenes, which took me a long time to find. The rest is just games and activities. It might be nice to put in featurettes on how the movie was made, but no. THIS MOVIE DVD= BAD BARGAIN!"
2,Not for people who dislike witchcraft,"The theme of this movie re-enforces a magic/witchcraft theme. It is not for a Christian to really show there children since it is contrary to a Christian belief. It has alot of good special effects, but I found my young nieces would be too impressionable with this. Caution."
2,Hogwarts? Hogwash!,"Someday, when the Harry Potter fad is back in perspective and adults no longer wet themselves with excitement about the impending release of every children's book, this movie will be remembered as an inocuous kid flick -- nothing more. I admit the casting seems to have been excellent, but then I never bothered with the book, so I had no preconceptions regarding how the characters should look. The special effects were all right -- especially the flying sequences. As for the story, any comparisons to Cinderella were purely intentional. Listening to 50-year-olds go on and on about how magical this film is stimulates my gag reflex. If you're looking for an ""adult"" fairytale, buy a Lord of the Rings DVD. Any grownup who spends his/her allowance on this Harry Potter silliness should be spanked and sent to his/her room without supper."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen!!,"This movie was great!! Okay, I admit that to me it was a bit boring because I have read the books and I already knew what was gonna happen. This movie shoud be seen by people who haven't read the books, because you'll enjoy it much more and it'll be more exiting. But I bought the DVD and I loved it! It took me a while to find the deleted scenes and I think that they woud have looked very good in the movie, but then again, it woud have been WAY too long. Anyway, I loved the movie and to those people who think this movie is not for kids, it is. I think that you need to imaginate and this movie makes you imaginate. And besides, in case you haven't noticed, the rating's PG, not R!!!"
4,"Movie is 5 stars, extra disc...no...","Of course the movie itself is great on DVD. The extra disc is no big deal. It is difficult to navigate the ""special"" features and very frustrating that there is not more there. I missed full bios on the cast, as I have been enjoying that on other DVDs. But, this DVD set is worth the price any day!! Harry Potter is alive again in my living room!"
2,Time for Self-Satisfied Harry to Retire,"The fourth HARRY film, (following ""The Trouble With Harry Potter,"" ""When Harry Potter Met Sally,"" and the series' high-water-mark, ""Dirty Harry Potter""), is a mostly hollow exercise that does little to enliven a once-lucrative franchise. Smugness and in-your-face special effects are no substitute for interesting characters and genuine inspiration. Desperate."
1,Harry Potter Is A Joke!!!,"Why would anyone waste their time watching this crap! Whoop-De-Do It's Harry Potter...Who Really cares anyway! Some nerdy kid with magical powers, I'd rather see The Incredible Hulk instead at least that's interesting. C'mon people this Harry Potter phase is really getting old! Stop making these stupid movies. I wish I could have ranked all of these dumb Harry Potter movies with 0 stars be they wouldn't let me go lower than 1 star...too bad because all of these movies are simply horrible!!!"
1,Totally disappointed...,"They surely knew how to advertise this movie. There were less special effects than I expected. The movie is incredibly slow and long. It is easy to get bored. I expected Harry to do more spells and ""witchy"" work, but it was Hermione who did just few spells. Since Harry was a ""natural"" I expected more action but it was more like a quest for something movie. It was like if you were watching Zelda made in a movie. I was truly disappointed."
1,Special Effects,"Everybody loves special effects in the movies, but these Harry Potter films have one special effect parents are missing. When the movie is over the seeds of witchcraft are planted into the mind of their child and a wicked life will result. What evil goes in, will come out. Repackaged witchcraft for children, that's all it is. For example; many convicts in prison practice witchcraft with many wizard tatoos and demonic symbols. There is no such thing as good witchcraft as this movie tries to portray. The special effect is yet to be an unpleasant surprise upon the next generation having grown up with witchcraft firmly implanted and recognized as harmless fun. The crime level is going to rise. Just look at the evil spells the Harry Potter movie uses to propel the plot; drinking blood and other witchcraft evils. Hardly innocent and harmless! Is this what you want your children to watch? Woe to those who call evil good and good evil."
5,Great New World,"This movie was a lot of fun to watch for the first time in theaters and has been fun every time I have watched it since. The introduction of the wizarding world in conjunction with the ""normal"" world was well done. The characters, their interaction and development, and the great world of majic we've all dreamed of as kids has been brilliantly brought to life in this movie."
5,Its good but...,Delivery was quicker then I excepted. The only problem was I was sent the UK ultimate edition (HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE) and I ordered the American ultimate edition (HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE). There is no real difference but anyone with kids knows what I'm talking about.
5,So fun!,"I thought this movie was going to be an overhyped little kids movie, but it really isn't. I had refused to read the books and watch the movie until my mom became hooked on the books. Then, I gave in...and now I'm glad I did.This movie is a spectacular ride through a young wizard's (Harry) introduction to the magic that was always in his blood. He and his friends go on an adventurous journey to stop the madman who killed Harry's parents, and show that they are all brave, true, and loyal.The special effects are incredible. Of course, sometimes, you can tell that they're using animitronics instead of the actors. (I think that might be on purpose, though.)I definitely recommend that you watch this movie...no matter how old you are because you will definitely enjoy it!"
5,As was the book...,"The movie edition of this wonderful first installment in the Harry Potter series finally brings the imagined word pictures to life. Wonderfully directed, artistically put together, this great movie is good for everyone. One suggestion- always read the book before you watch any movie. Reading is knowledge."
3,A nice looking film but.....,"This film is a case of if you don't know the story, you will have questions all through the film and or miss some points.I was one of those rare people who hadn't read any of the books till this year.Now that I read the books, the film could have been much better!I thought Dumbledore was a guy that you wondered if he was either insane or the supreame genious. Richard Harris(God rest him) came off as a little too grandfatherly for my vision of the character.I thought Snape was right on as was Mcgonical(sp) and somewhat Hagrid.The children were almost there. I kind of thought Harry had a bit of the smart A-- to him which Danial did not portray.Hermione was supposed to be the busybody knowitall and that almost came across.Ron and the twins were good!Overall if you read the books, it is a fun film."
2,Magical but also disappointing,"I have enjoyed it but only so far. Imagination reigns and you expect unrealistic scenes, but there is a limit. At some stage Harry is given an 'invisibility cloak' left to him by his deceased parents. Soon after he has to hide from the badies. The invisibility cloak would have come in handy there but he appears to forget all about it. My five-year old son commented: why is he not hiding under the magic coat? When flaws are spotted by five-year olds, then there must be something wrong. In this Harry Potter madness are we losing our sense of criticism?"
2,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD","First off, please note that this is a review of the DVD itself; not the movie. The movie is good, and might as well have been a few bucks cheaper and sold as one disk. Why? Because the second disk was apparently designed by some sadistic idiot. The box promises seven deleted scenes, something everyone that buys a DVD wants to see. Trouble is, you can't just click on a ""Deleted Scenes"" menu; you have to play some silly game! Rather like playing Myst or some puzzle game, and only when you're done do you get to see the deleted scenes. I didn't even bother to finish trying; I just put the 2nd disk back in the box, and there it will stay until I tire of this DVD and sell it. All in all, a staggeringly poor way to format bonus features; shame on WB for doing this."
2,"4-Star Film, 2-Star DVD Set!","""Harry Potter"" is a decent movie with good acting, good visual effects and weak-but-interesting storytelling. My concern HERE is the DVD packaging. Having the opportunity to release some fine behind-the-scenes material, Warner Bros. has really messed up this time. Instead, they've released a stupid kiddie-Video Disc. The only safe-havens on this disc are an interview featurette (With the filmakers commenting on this film as well as the sequel, which will also star Kenneth Branagh), theatrical trailers, and deleted scenes that I can't even find yet! Take a hint, and get your kids the VHS. Trust me, you'll save some money for a good reason! Movie Grade: B+; DVD Grade: D+"
2,"Great movie, horrid DVD","This DVD is a huge disappointment. The movie is wonderful, but the ""special features"" that they lean so heavily on as a selling point don't even exist for all viewers. You can't watch the special features unless you jump through a bunch of contrived hoops, .... On top of this, the contrived hoops don't function, and lock up both my DVD player and the DVD drive on my computer. If they wanted to slip something unadvertised in for those people willing to play their silly games, that would be one thing. It seems dishonest, though, to lean on a special features as a selling point and not put them in a format that can be accessed by everyone. I could have bought the VHS format and not lost anything."
2,Screwy Special Features,"The movie itself gets 5 stars for me. However, the special features get negative stars. Either I'm an idiot, or they are extremely hard to figure out. When I go to Diagon Alley,I can't select any bricks. I press my arrow keys and nothing happens. When I tke the self-guided tour of Hogwarts, I press my arrow keys to move me around and nothing happens. Now I know my remote isn't broken because I can navigate through the main menu just fine with my arrow keys..."
2,Stick in the mud,"Okay, so I'm a spoilsport. This movie wasn't awful. It also wasn't good. It was more or less completely forgettable. I think children would like it, but I suspect the books are vastly superior. I have not read the Harry Potter books (although I will one day), but I am a great lover of children's literature. From Madeline L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, through Roald Dahl's magnificent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, to Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, I loved them all. If the Harry Potter books have that quality, it somehow failed to translate to the film. For the record, I wasn't that thrilled with the Willy Wonka movie either (although it would get 3 stars from me)."
3,Harry Potter,My son is in the second grade. He enjoys reading the Harry Potter books. I have read the 1st one and am enjoying the second one. I have enjoy the inspiring story as it unfolds. It's magical and very funny. There is also mystery & action. I enjoy the 3 children who played the parts. There is also love and friendship. The characters are so imanganative. The sound effects were done very well. My husband also thought is was inspiring to be so creative. I liked being able to not guess what was happening next.
2,"Interesting, But Not the Book","The movie is a well-done attempt to condense the book into a watchable, visual version. However, much of the magic is convoluted and the many of the characters are made stale and wooden, partly because it is so difficult to condense this huge and irreplaceable book into a movie. One associate of mine described the acting as ""psychotic."" I give the girl who played Hermione Granger a thumbs-up and if you need to know the story for class, watching the movie is a good way to get it fast. But it won't be nearly as enjoyable as reading the book itself."
5,Who says Harry Potter's not a good movie?,Well i didn't see the dvd but i saw it on the big screen.Who says Harry Potter's not a good movie? Who cares if they took out a lot of stuff? Would you want to sit there watching the movie for 10 hours? No. I didn't think so.
4,standards,"I am a sixteen year old girl and in my opinion, the movie was good but it was not fully true to the book. I went to see the movie two days after it appeared in the theater with some fellow fans and we saw everything that was not there and that was changed. We noticed that there were some characters that were missing from the movie. also, neville longbottom was supposed to be in detention with Harry potter, fang, Hagrid, hermione and malFoy.For the most part, the movie held true to the book but for the minor mistakes, I think j.K Rowling could have done something to help. after all, she is very talented and I admire her for what she writes and the fact that she struggled before she became famous. Keep writing Rowling and if possible, will there be another book after all seven just to explain what harry does after his years at hogwarts? I hope so because I enjoy her writing."
3,Bonnie's great -- shoot the producers.,"Has there ever so wonderful a singer who has been so poorly served by her producers? It shouldn't take a genius to figure out that what makes a Bonnie Tyler song is just that stunning voice, that voice that is both destroyed and destroying, it's rough, harsh beauty lacerating her heart and ours. The sad bit here is that virtually every track here is wildly overproduced. The effect can be truly awful, sounding like some unholy collision of ELO, Nelson Riddle, and a rhythm machine. Please, someone record this amazing lady right --just give us that voice."
5,great cd,this is a great cd with all her hits.i'm glad i own this cd.i grew up listening to her.she's pretty and has a great singing voice.
2,Ho Hum rehash of previous written material,"Bob Arnot is a friendly an interesting newsperson but not a great writer.Provides nothing new from the original, gold-standard book ""The Arthritis Cure.""Basically, this book is a thinly veiled attempt to sell a second-rate glucosamine product, Move Free. This is made by Schiff, the Weider company associated with all of those silly body-building magazines, potions and pills. Schiff's website gives us the clue to this association. Move Free has an unproven mixture of glucosamine forms."
4,"great, but....","This is an amazing score (my personal favorite is the ""The Untouchables - End Title"") but it suffers from a problem plaguing many film score CDs, it is just too short (39 min). But, it is still good."
5,Excellence book of knowledge,"this book strength lies in its broad scope and in the blending of institutional history whith theological development and historical fact. Unlike many books of this kind, this one devotes considerable attention to the development of early Christianity. msujanto10@hotmail.com"
4,Informative for me,"I had purchased this book when it first came out, but just now got around to reading it. I thought it was going to be a rehash of Catholic apologetics that I pretty much have a handle on. This book would more appropriately be placed in the history section of your library. I already had a rudimentary knowledge of Church Councils and the various heresies, but after reading this book I am now more knowledgeable of how and why the Councils came about and why the heresies were so dangerous. Whitehead goes into quite a bit of detail on the Arian heresy and just how close Christianity came in denying Christ's divinity.Only if your mind is closed or you have axes to grind with the Catholic Church will you NOT come away reading this with a better understanding of what the early Christian Church was and give you a better appreciation of what the Church is now."
3,interesting read,"it was very in depth...but rather boring at the end. informative and educational, learned a lot about where American wealth went during that time."
3,Price was right,"I downloaded this to my kindle and read it last night. It was not the best regency I have ever read, but was entertaining and distracting."
4,Great book,"Awesome book. Excellent writing. This is a very interesting book. Although what others said, the flow is not si good."
3,Another take on history,This is not a frivolous book and it isn't an easy read but it gives a different view of the historical alliances between the American heiresses and the impecunious British nobility.
3,Interesting Information,After watchng Downton Abbey I wondered how many American married Englishmen so thisbook helped answer that question. The history was well documented but the writing got a bit tediousand repetitive so I did scan parts of the book as it was long and had too many details for a generalreading.
4,"Very interesting view of England and her former colony, America","To Marry an English Lord held my interest while helping me understand many of the traditions of both America and England. I loved the many pictures and the writing was not boring. I did find that I did not want to read it alone from cover to cover. I would read a few chapters and then read other books for a few days, then back to it."
5,A Fascinating History Lesson,"""To Marry An English Lord"" is a must-have for any lover of Victorian/Edwardian biographies. This book follows the lives, loves, and regrets of several young ""dollar princesses"" who move from American to English high society. Some of these young women find romantic love and social acceptence among the English aristocracy, others come to less happy endings. An excellent read."
5,Fascinating view into a world gone by...,"Every time I read this book it becomes more and more interesting. Meticulously researched, with great little anecdotes and etiquette tips.This book is a lot of fun! I especially liked the many photographs of the designer gowns (most by Worth, if you please!) that are liberally scattered throughout.If you're ananglophile you'll want to get this one!"
2,Not an easy read.,This book reads like a documentary. It is long and is written without any obvious order. It is a good book to read if you have trouble falling asleep!
4,To Marry an English Lord,"Almost all history books are attractive to me - I just love reading history! WhileI thought this book would be a little ""lightweight"", it seemed like a gooddiversion from the Plantagenets, Romanovs and George Washington.Talk about life on a different level - and through the looking glass - thisbook was an eye-opener and fun!! Good insight into what American-made moneywas able to buy on the European Nobility Market for the enterprising ingenue and her family during the Gilded Age!Who bought who, how much those titles cost and was it worth it?Nothing earth-shattering here - just a delicious, gossipy view of a past world few of us will ever experience."
5,A lot of fun to read and very informative,"Even if you're not a fan of Edith Wharton or Henry James novels, there is something for everyone in this book. Almost of all of the book is about American and English society during the Victorian period. The authors went out of their way to make the vast amount of material easy to read and very entertaining.The differences in the upper class of both countries are contrasted in life styles, art, architecture, travel, marriage and courting customs.This book is wonderfully presented with sidebar articles, minibiographies, drawings and photographs. It was a pleasure to read."
4,Tremendous amount of trivia....thoroughly entertaining..loved it!,"Highly recommended by a cohort who is also a Downton Abbey devotee, this enormous collection of highly entertaining trivia re: Anglomania proved to be a winner! No need to try to read in one sitting! One can easily digest it in small bites or large hunks. The photography and illustrations are delightful and certainly enlightening! Once the reader perceives the well-executed ""diversions"" from many of the narrative sections, he can moved more easily through the adventure. Overall, an interesting glance into our past during the tumultuous late 19th and early 20th century in both America and England. Recommended for hearty Anglophiles!"
2,Not what I had expected,This is kind of a dumb book which I was embarrassed to give to my sister-in-law along with Lady Almina.
2,boring,I found this book boring. It seemed to repeat over and over the same stories about people. Its written as if my great aunt sylvia is relating family history to me.
2,Boring,"Unlike Downton Abbey, this was a bore. It was just names pieced together with no real essence. I fell asleep reading it over and over again."
1,Boring!,I would give this less than one star if I could. Very dry reading - I finally gave up trying to finish this book.
2,Disappointed...,"I thought this was going to be more of a storyline, but it is more like a documentary. Some of the information is interesting but I really wanted a story more like ""Downton Abby"".......Not really glad I bought this!"
2,Not what I expected,"This book definitely was not what I thought it would be. I expected a novel, with a plot. This was a strange, disjointed account of mid-19th to early 20th century girls from wealthy New York families who couldn't fit into New York society because they were nouveau riche, moving to Europe in order to buy husbands with titles.And the accounts of these women weren't presented in any particular order - there was no flow to this book. It was as if paragraphs were plopped down on the page randomly."
2,More Information Than I Desired,"The first quarter of this book did deal with marrying an English Lord. It is interesting. The author does a good job informing us about the elite social set in New York that ostracized the newly rich Americans. These rich, but outsiders, created their own social set by marrying land rich but hard cash poor English gentry. But then MacColl goes into excessive detail of weddings, the Prince of Wales and his attraction to the rich young ladies from America, the excesses of the rich in their entertaining and on and on. The books ends with endless lists of who married whom."
3,A movement of money,This is an interesting account of the ambitions of American self made people who sought to marry their daughters off to English aristocracy. The aristocracy were largely broke and the Americans were rich. They sought to improve the social standing of their families by marrying their girls into the aristocracy and financing the lords and ladies back into the black. There are some interesting tales and an amazing number of cross Atlantic couplings.
4,Pulls it all together,This book has helped me understand better many of my favorite books and movies from Jane Austin to Downton Abbey. It answers the question of what is a lord? Who is a barron? It also describes the economics of those beautiful large manors. This book also has many wonderful pictures of lords and ladies at the turn of the 19th century. Also are renderings inside and out of these grand estates. For this reason I wish that I had the paper version of this book so that I could see the pictures better. Some of the drawings can be viewed larger at the book's website. If you love English literature and period movies you will really enjoy this book. I plan to buy a copy for my grandma for Christmas.
3,I couldn't finish it,"At first I really enjoyed this book. It was a fascinating look into a really interesting time and place. However, I couldn't finish it. It devolved into something extremely boring about how many dressed the heiresses wore and how outlandish their parties were. That's all fine but it added nothing to my insight of the time and place. If it had stopped after giving a few examples, I would have enjoyed it more."
