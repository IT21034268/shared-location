1,The Count Deserves to go to Prison,"In this unbelievable movie distortion of a classic novel, our ""hero,"" Edmond Dantes, visits the Island of Elba and meetsface-to-face with the most notorious and dangerous prisoner of his day: Napoleon Bonaparte. With full knowledge that he is, in effect, committing high treason against his native country of France, Edmond Dantes agrees to take a secret letter from Bonaparte and deliver it to one of his loyal conspirators on French soil. With this indisputable evidence, prosecutor Villefort would obviously be quite justified in sentencing Dantes to a lengthy prison term. So, other than the miserable prison conditions (suffered by all the convicts), why would the movie viewer have any sympathy for someone who has committed high treason?!"
2,Pret-ty stupid,"If you read the book or have, indeed, ever read ANYTHING by Dumas, don't insult yourself by watching this movie. What's especially amusing is the bonus interview they have with the screenwriter, who truly believes he's improving Dumas.Hollywood really knows how to mess up a classic. It's well-acted and has great costumes, but the rest is pretty ridiculous."
1,Pan & Scan... Forget it!!!,"I've been itching to buy this movie since I saw it in the theatre. Now I'm going to have to wait until they release a widescreen version because there's no way I'm paying for pan&scan.;A beautifully crafted film both in visuals and acting, not to mention the masterful story telling. The only letdown is not having widescreen, which is unforgivable and therefore this DVD release gets one star, for what would otherwise be a five star rating."
2,Missing essential information,"I have purchased the book because I wanted to re-install Linux on my Dell laptop.There are a few specific areas that should be covered in a good book about Linux laptop:PCMCIA, Advanced Power Manager, video card issues (especially nVidia), hd tuning, and,last but not least, hibernation.The first few issues are mentioned with more or less success. The most important one, the most specific one,sleep and hibernation, is superficial and insufficient. Bill Ball's advice is: if you got it with yourMS-DOS installed on the disk, there is a hibernation partition and it's better not to touch it.This is of zero value for someone seeking to install everything."
2,Great movie--BAD DVD!!,"Swordsman II is one of my all time favorite martial arts movies--the movie itself I'd give 5 stars. HOWEVER...this DVD edition is TERRIBLE! The picture quality isn't bad, hence my 2 stars, but the english translation is just AWFUL! Not only are there typos in the subtitles (example: two characters are galloping along on horses, one says, ""just keep RIDDING!""), but there are many other blatant errors. Brigitte Lin's great Asia the Invincible is called ""Invinvible Dawn"" on this DVD. Take a look at the title on the DVD cover here, it's SWORD-MAN not Swordsman--they didn't even get the cover right! As a film, this is fantastic though, and not to be missed. So, unless you can understand Mandarin and/or Cantonese and don't need the English subtitles, please buy the VHS version, you'll be much happier! Don't miss this great movie, just don't try the DVD."
1,Legend of Swordsman = butchered Dimension DVD,"Legend of Swordsman dvd review - dreadful, dubbed, cut, americanised, renamed, new dreadful audio track, poor disc = do not buy this version! (buy Swordsman 2)film review - Swordsman 2 was Jet Li's largest grossing domestic film in Hong Kong in the early 90's, even outperforming Fist of Legend and the Once Upon a Time in China Series. Although the cast is very similar to the Once Upon a Time in China series due to the Tsui Hark influence (Jet Li, Yen Shi Kwan, etc). The only cast member from the original Swordsman (King Hu classic 90) is the gorgeous Fannie Yuen (Blue Phoenix).The wire-fu fighting and fantastical set make this an enchanting film, and the costumes are award-winning. This is not Jet's best film in my opinion, but is right up there with his best.Conclusion - get Swordsman 2 (Megastar), get an HK import - do anything but buy this butchered version that pays no respect to the culture or ethos from which this movie emerged."
3,"Pretty good, make sure to watch the first Swordsman",This movie is crazy. Lots of stringwork and crazy fighting and blood. I liked it except for the fact the subtitles didnt translate well. I had to watch it a couple of times to figure out what was going on (I didnt watch the first one).
2,Blech.,"I love Bridget Lin as much as the next person, but she was the only interesting thing in this movie. Fine, it was cute to see Jet Li boozing it up every other minute...I totally returned this DVD..the picture is not enhanced at all. While I thought the plot of Lin being a man turned woman was cute (We know how the HK films love to play with gender), the story was completely fantastical...the sword fighting wasn't that clear, absolutely no martial arts. And mostly unlikeable characters. I'm sure the only reason it made so much money in HK is that Bridget Lin was in it...her movies always make tons of money."
2,Buena Vista Home Vid DVD ruined it!,"Im here rating ""The legend of The Swordsman"" wich is actually ""Buena Vista Home Vid"" DVD version of a great movie called ""SwordsmanII""...First of all, A LOT of dialogues just disappeared, scenes were cut and combat sounds effects RUINED ! ! ! I guess thats what happens when u ask a spanish comapny to re-do a HK classical movie.Anyway dont just buy the ""Buena Vista Home Vid DVD"" Called The Legend of the Swordsman, aka Jet Li collection... yeah good job ruinning Jet Li classics Buena Vista Home Vid .... grr"
1,"Cool Movie, [awful] DVD","The Legend of the Swordsman (aka Swordsman 2) is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. This version (The Legend of Swordsman) is missing 8 minutes of film--they cut 8 minutes of FREAKING FILM from the original movie. Also, these guys were sooo lazy, they didn't even bother to include the original language track on the DVD. Instead, you can only listen to a HORRIBLE dubbed version of this movie. The video transfer is on the mediocre side too."
5,One of the best of its era,"I watched this movie years ago and remembered it being one of the best Hong Kong fantasy/martial arts film. There were a bunch coming out around the same time, but this one stood out. It had the standard martial arts but the story line and the chemistry between the stars was what elevated this movie above the rest. Hong Kong fantasy/martial arts film tend to be incoherent to people because it tries to condense too massive of a story line into a 2 hour movie. Generally, these tales are filmed in a serial format for prime time television broadcasting. When watching this movie, don't try to understand all the detailed story line. You won't. The translation is atrocious. Just go with the flow of the film. Suspend your rational brain because a lot of the movie's actions are outrageous. Watch Swordman II like it's a period/fantasy epic instead of a Jackie Chan movie and you will enjoy it much more. You won't regret it. It's one of the best."
1,LOL~!!!!,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
2,"unless you like old Bruce Lee movies, this isn't for you","It is decent, but somewhat ruined by the english voice-overs. If the original Cantonese or whatever had been subtitled, it would be better, but there is no subtitle option with the original audio. The feel of the movie seems tainted by this, along with 70's kung-fu style camera shots and quality. The average Westerner wouldn't like this and I only write for those expecting an earlier version of Crouching Tiger. These reviews seem a little too kind. It's basically cheese, something you'll watch and laugh at."
4,Great jet li movie but not his best,"Jet LI plays young swordsman Ling in this epic tale. He loves wine and woman and through out the film he wants to find the strongest wine. Besides being a drunk in this movie he does pull off some super fast swordplay. This movie will have you rewinding fight scenes to see what exactly happened. Even in slow motion it's hard to follow. I think they sped the film up too fast in some areas, but besides that it's a decent movie..."
1,"Oh my god, what a terrible movie!","I almost think everyone else must be reviewing another movie. 38 reviewers, average of 4 stars? That is the reason I bought it. I assumed that this was a little known gem. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I really like Jet li a lot but this was worse than lame. The Arch villan never does anything but wave his/her arms invoking supernatural forces, making people explode etc. and fling some sewing needles...really! ... I usually do not review movies but this was sooo bad and almost everyone else cannot say enough good things about it, I felt obliged to at least put some doubt in the minds of a prospective buyer. I wish I had read a review like this before I made the mistake of getting it."
1,"Oh my god, what a terrible movie!","I guess I have been lucky. I have enjoyed every Jet Li movie I have seen till this one. The villan never does more than move his/her arms around invoking the forces of nature and throwing some sewing needles...really. I would have given it no stars if possible. I received this movie yesterday, thinking it to be some not well known gem. I mean 38 reviews, average 4 stars. I listed mine for sale today. I do not want it befouling my collection. I am sure some people will think I am full of it but for god sakes buy it used and don't waste your money."
2,Bad subtitles/wonky audio.,"It's great that they decided to redo the subtitles in bright white w/black borders so that they could actually be read, unlike in the VHS print. It's too bad, however, that they didn't find somebody who spoke English to do the translation. The redone subtitles are grammatically worse than the original, to the point that they are completely nonsensical; even if you try to deduce what they might have meant from prior knowledge of the movie, they are still incomprehensible.It's almost insulting that they care so little of their English speaking viewers, and worse, it is very distracting.I also experienced weird doubling/echoing artifacts with some of the music tracks near the end of the film (not sure if this was my player or not, but I kind of doubt it).Combine the two and you end up with a pretty good film on a crappy DVD."
5,Fantastic,This is great kung fu fantasy action. The non stop action will keep you grounded to your seat wanting to find out what's next! The story tells about a young swordsman Ling (Jet Li) who wants to get away from all the fighting taking place between two sects but how he and his clan gets pulled back into it. In his hurry to get away from it all he starts falling in love with the enemy who is really a man but has the power to change into a beautiful woman who likes drinking wine as much as Ling does.
2,Note nearly as good as my memory of it...,"I had fond, but vague memories of this movie from years back... then watched it again in this dubbed version and was apalled. Even beyond the dubbing, the movie itself is just so cheesily directed and cut that even the martial arts don't play well. It just doesn't hold up to the best of the genre, especially now that it's been taken to such a higher level with recent films like House of the Flying Daggers."
2,Not close to the best,"This movie had so much potential, with a great cast and promising story. Problem is the action was shot as if the person holding the camera was drunk. Quick cuts only work as long as the viewer has a frame of reference to know what is going on. This movie has no frame of reference shots. Jet Li and Brigitte Lin are two of the best, but this movie wastes them."
5,Musical Instrument to Announce Visitors,"Conceived as a musical instrument? Made almost entirely of birch wood its two tone chime is the familiar xylophone we are all used to from the now very distant '50s. Im reminded of chimes I heard in department stores of that era as well. Loud enough and very attractive in appearance in never looks out of place if its somewhat out of past. Not what I expected, its a pleasant reminder of the past without connecting wires. A 'striking'(pun intended)anomaly if ever there was. It cannot connect you to Facebook,Netlix or Utube, It only connects to 1952, world without end, etc.,etc."
4,Worth the sale price,"I paid $5.85 for this mirror, and Amazon has now dropped the price to $5.02. This is about what the mirror is worth. I had it in mind for travelling for my makeup bag. It will work, but it is a little big because the flat length is 9 and 1/2 inches, and the diameter of the mirror is 5 inches. It gets only four stars because there is a little silvering missing on the edge of one side, so the quality is not the best it could be. This is the first time that I have had a mirror with 10X magnification. Be aware that you have to put the mirror fairly close to use that side, and you could scare yourself, as I did."
2,Cheap,"This tea is cheap for a reason. It is probably 1/4 twigs and the rest cheap tea. It tastes ok, but you can find much better. The amount is huge for the price, but I wish I had spent my money on something better. I will not buy this again."
5,Excellent Product,This tea is flavorful and tastes fresh. It brews up a little slow but any green tea that doesn't isn't areal green tea. Be sure to use a tea ball that has a little room in it as this tea's leaves expand and unfurl.
1,Bad brand??,"I was told to try this tea from a friend who claimed it was the best tea she's ever had. I lived in Japan for 2 1/2 years and can tell the difference between real excellent quality green tea and the crappy american stuff they put on the shelves in our grocery stores. This tea tasted like crap and smelled like something charred and burnt.Now, I don't know if I just don't like this tea or I bought a bad brand, but when I shared it with my friend who claimed gunpowder tea was the best tea she'd ever had, she took one sniff and look at this brand and said this wasn't the good stuff. She wouldn't even try it. I don't know what to look for with gunpowder tea if there is a good brand out there, but this brand is definitely not it."
1,Big Fella Gets Worse With Age,"This release from Seattles' dead horse beaters ""Easy Big Fella"" is more of the unremarkable material that has been the standard since the original line-up fell apart after their first cd release. With the departure of songwriter Steve Mandl and horn master Colin Shroy, Easy Big Fella have lost whatever it was that made them such a great Seattle secret. With their first album out of print, any of their other releases are a poor example of what was once a really great band."
4,A First Hand Account of Quiet Life on the Plantation,"An aging woman documents her memories of life on a plantation as a girl to counter post Civil War accounts of plantation life she feels to be unfair. A must read for anyone studying life on plantations or slavery in Virginia as it is a first hand account from perspectives of the period. The perspective of a young girl, and what events survive in her memories from childhood, is especially interesting. An easy read except for some of the phonetic spelling."
3,No Tip,"So based on information from Kensington's site, I buy this adapter. Unfortunately both tips I need (kyocera phone and compaq nc8230) don't actually work with the device. Otherwise, it looks really slick and I'm sure I'd love it if I could actually plug it into anything."
1,Functionally good but poor design,"This is a good universal by all accounts in terms of size, available adaptors, split charge, etc. The biggest design flaw is the short power cable that causes the brick to dangle from the wall. This can result in it falling out of the wall or causing stress on the cable / connection. Ultimately mine failed and is now in the trash as Kensington won't stand behind their poor design."
3,not enough power,I own a Dell M90 which takes a 130W power supply. The inverter shuts off if i connect it to my computer while running. I have to power down and shut off the computer to recharge it. not exactly what i wanted. should work okay for lower power consuming computers.
1,2 of these have died on me,"I bought the Kensington model #33917 notebook power adapter when I was on a trip and had left my normal ThinkPad power supply at home. The power supply worked great for 35 days and then just died.Kensington technical support was great to work with - they sent me a replacement immediately. Unfortunately, that replacement died a couple of months later after only 6 days of usage. Again, their tech support was very courteous and helpful and sent me another one.If I had been traveling when the 1st and 2nd power supplies died on me, that would have seriously inconvenienced and possibly crippled my ability to do my job - even more so if there wasn't an electronics store around to buy a replacement. At this point, I can't rely on this particular model of power supply so this latest replacement will stay at home for use only in emergencies."
1,Died quickly & silently,"Worked fine when it arrived, charged an HP Envy15 notebook, which was rated to require a 120 watt power supply. Within a month, it stopped working. I was traveling on business at the time and found myself with a dead battery and no way to charge it. For a premium product this was very disapointing! On the plus side, the charger did not burn up my hotel room or fry my laptop. I have not tried to return it yet... We shall see if amazon has decent customer service or not."
4,Great! Except no right angle tips,This product is great. Except for: 1) no right angle tips are provided make use almost impossible on planes 2) Power cord too short. but standard cords can be used after minor modification to adapter.
5,Works great with HP pavilion laptop,"I got my unit today (a refurbished one). It works great with my HpPavilion laptop and even keeps charging battery during multitasking works. It come with 8 different tips for Toshiba, HP, Compaq, Sony and Dell laptops. As I understand for other brads of laptops you need to buy a suitable tip. It has enough power for my hungry HP laptop. It has car charger adapter and AIR? adapter too. I have not tried these adapters so I have no idea about them.The power cord is too short and Kensington should improve this one."
4,Good to Have on the Road,"This works very well and has replaced two other chargers I used to travel with me. The only drawback is that a tip is not available for my LG cell phone, which is a two year old model. That's pretty lame. Besides that, I would have to recommend the adapter to anyone who needs to lighten their load on the road."
2,Poor plug design,"I've broken three tips for this adapter in the last few months. The problem? The tip and the part it plugs into stick straight out from the laptop for a total of a good two inches or so, providing a nice long lever arm with which to shatter the tip. All it takes is a fall off the bed onto the carpeted floor, or a few twists of the laptop against the top of my leg (right by where the power adapater plugs in to the laptop), and *crunch*.I'd been wondering why almost all the *other* universal A/C adapters on the market have plugs that turn 90 degrees right where they connect to the laptop. Now I know."
4,"Looking for ""The Power of Love""",Me: technophile that has way too many devices and even more power cords. You: slim sexy supply that will clean house and fulfill all my needs. Let's get it ON!!!This device is good for those that travel and or use their laptops between the office and the home. It is thin and light and w/ the range of tips available it will allow me to eliminate 90% of my power adapters. The short wall cord can be annoying but w/ a small extension this can become tolerable. The main problem that I do have is that they have yet to provide a plug for the Lenovo T60. As soon as this becomes available I will gladly upgrade my review from 4 to 5 stars.
3,Kensington is too stupid to make computer accessories,"I have been asking them for over a year to simply publish a large ""smart tip"" compatibility chart or table, showing ALL their smart tips and ALL the known compatible devices. They just refer me to their stupid smart tip ""finder"" where you enter in your device/mfg/model# and it tries to find the right tip. What if you have 10 different devices? 100? Too impossibly cumbersome. As others have said, Kensington tech support has no clue. The power adapter does seem to work, IF you are GOD/omniscient and can figure out which tip you need. Knowing the correct tip is essential, since that controls not only the fit of plug into socket, but also voltage. Random guessing, which is what Kensington reduces its customers to, will surely fry your equipment."
3,"quiet for first year, now it's loud","I liked this product just fine for the first year of use, but now the fan is so loud it's really annoying. When we're in the car we try to hide it under the seat because it's so loud. Too bad the warranty expired so I can't send it in to be fixed."
2,Not what it shold be,Although this adapter works as described it is poorly executed. The tips fall apart requiring you to order new 2 packs at $9.95. I also agree with the other comments about the short power cord and lack of documentation. For this amount of money they could do a lot better.
1,Destroyed my Dell Inspiron battery charger,"When I plugged this Kensington power adapter in to my Dell Inspiron, it could not charge the battery. When I unplugged it, I could no longer charge the battery with my Dell power adapter."
1,Non existent customer service and poor plug availability,"I wasted a whole bunch of time trying to get a plug for my Lenovo. When I finally got through to them, they didn't even know Lenovo was a laptop maker. They don't answer eMail, either.I would advise anyone contemplating the purchase of this to buy the plug first and have it in their hand. Their claim of fitting most laptops is borderline false advertizing."
2,The fan is just too loud,"The product is a nice size and weight, is well designed, and works as advertised. But the cooling fan is just too loud. It was audible in my car at freeway speeds, I would hate to sit next to me on an airplane and have to listen to it for a transcon flight. I'll have to research another one."
2,Very poor parts availability,"Love this product, but if you ever need to replace a part or find a new tip, good luck!Six months ago I lost the car adapter and tried to buy a replacement. Guess what, they don't sell one. I ended up buying a whole used unit from eBay just to get the part. This month I upgraded to an new HP dv series laptop. Went to the Kensington site and googled around. They do not make the tip, and their web site is totally useless in helping you find anything.If you want a truly ""universal"" power supply with good availability of replacement parts, stay away from this. Try iGo instead."
3,"charges good, but hums for audio","this charges my 15"" macbook pro. its charges wonderfully, but when i use the headphone jack, a terrible hum in emitted. im guessing it has something to do with the charge not being grounded? anyways, i hoping its inevitable? if someone knows different, please comment."
1,Amazingly bad design,"Kensington in all their wisdom markets an engineered product without a hint of engineering!!! Specifically - what are the input and output numbers? I see something about 120 Volts input.Then I see ""any wall outlet."" Are these rubes so far out in the potato patch that they havent heard of offshore voltages - and frequencies?My VAIO power works automatically at 120 to 220 Volts, 50 or 60 cycles. The Kensington product seems to be geared only for US 110 volts.Oh, then put a short power cord. That cord wont work in European trains - the transformer's weight just unplugs when hanging from the high-up ""wall"" plug.I wonder if we could give a product a ""0"" star rating!"
2,This cannot seem to support a 65W laptop power suppy,We purchased this Kensington power inverter just before we drove from Oregon to Québec. It worked for the first hour with an Apple 65W power supply (for iBook) and then the red warning light came on and power was cut. Our cell phone charger worked just fine so I will assume the inverter could not handle the load from the laptop power supply.Later on our trip we purchased a Jensen 160-watt inverter and that works just fine with our laptop.A shame because the Kensington had a sleek profile which was easy to store and fit well under the bucket seat with plenty of room for adequate ventilation.
1,Bring a book just in case,"I purchased this item to power my MacBook on airplanes. I had four long haul flights this month. Two 7 hour flights, and two 10 hour flights on United Boeing 777s. I could only get the Kensington Ultra Portable Inverter to work on the first flight out. On the others, as soon as I plugged the Inverter into the Empower recepticle, the Empower light would go off. When I pulled the Inverter out, the Empower light came back on. For what I bought it for, this product did not do its job."
3,Does not work well with my Gateway,"My Gateway convertable has problems with this. It is not necessarily the fault of Kensington, but Gateway user should beware. When first plugged in the computer switches repeatedly between the battery and the power adapter."
3,Nice t-shirt,"I took my chance in ordering this shirt based on what the other reviewer said. Sure enough, the words are not the same typeface as the picture shows, which to my knowledge is the official Don't Mess With Texas style. Other than that, the shirt is good quality and for what I'm going to use it for (tshirt quilt), it will work just fine. But, the seller should use a picture of the 'actual' tshirt so that customers know exactly what they are getting."
2,Is there an official Don't Mess with Texas shirt? It's not this one.,"Long story short, the shirt doesn't quite match the picture as the font is off. It may be me being overly anal, but I picked this item/vendor based upon the product picture to keep it from looking like a homemade knockoff. Shipping to Australia went without a hitch and at least my friend isn't familiar enough with the logo to feel gypped. I'm going to try to include a pic of the actual shirt. She says it's comfy."
2,it never download,it never download for me to watch it so i paid for something i cant watch. now i have wasted more money
3,Note to Self,I love Christian Keyes as an actor and have seen him in many plays and movies. This just wasn't his best play and I can't put my finger on why.
5,Great Movie,I really enjoyed this heartwarming movie. it was good from beginning to the end and i didn't want it to end. Besides the leading male of the movie is so dang FINE...Christian Keyes is the man. i try to watch everything he's in. when i frist seen him in a Tyler Perry play. i want to thank Tyler for giving him to us.
5,God Movie,"Enjoyed the movie, it was a bit slow at times but overall it is a worth watching and learning about the power of love and forgiveness."
5,love love love it,i love this movie very much . christian keyes is so fine ......... love any movie or play he is in.
5,About Time,"Glad to see a wholesome depiction of African American Love. Nice to see so overly sexual pictures of women, little to no cursing and goal oriented African Americans. Support this movie everyone."
2,Nady WA-120LT/E does not perform well,"Bought system with lavalier mic and it did not pick up very well at all. Had to hold mic in front of my mouth, so what is the value of a lavalier mic. Ordered a headset mic at extra cost. This mic did pick up to some extent, but had a very hard time positioning the Portable system so that the signal picked up. Standing across the room in front of system did work ?OK?. Tried to use in a small room presentation, but eventually shut it down and spoke without the system."
4,Snow in July,"I really enjoyed this heart-wrenching tale of a love / hate relationship between two sisters. Erin Mulcahy is the younger sister who is faced with the overwhelming responisbility of rescuing her older, drug-addicted sister and her sister's two young daughters. Although there are some dark moments in this story, Montana really comes alive with Ms. Barbieri's colorful description of a small mining town way past it's heyday. Snow in July is a quick, easy read that'll draw you in from the first page to the last!"
2,Morality Beyond Ethics,"Berkowitz does a good job undermining (a) the ""new Nietzsche"" of recent French theory and the postmodern politics of identity and difference; and (b) the ""old Nietzsche"" cavalierly dismissed as a nihilist and relativist. Where Berkowitz falls way short is in failing to understand how and why Nietzsche ""relies"" on traditional notions he allegedly ""repudiates"" (e.g., nature, reason, morality). Nietzsche is not interested in repudiation but transfiguration. You can't transfigure what isn't first ""figured"" (life and values as they have been). What Berkowitz calls the ""contest of [irreconcilable] extremes"" at the heart of Nietzsche's thought is actually the context in which Nietzsche argues for a life-affirming morality beyond the life-denying ethics of what we would call ""traditional values."" One may like the venerable truths Berkowitz favors. But how ironic to turn Nietzsche, of all thinkers, into a virtual pretext for arguing traditional values!"
3,Great Value - Bad Fit,"I was very impressed with the quality of the clubs and the bag.However there are a couple of negitives. The set is advertised to be for girls aged 4-8,I think it should have been rated for girls 8-10 or by height (48""-54"") or both. I bought the set for my 7 year old grandaughter who is 44"" tall and she has to choke-up 4"" to get the club to set on the ground properly. She is also challenged with the club head weight,I thought the iron heads (specificly) would have been proportionately sized but they're not,in fact the 9 iron head is slightly larger then my Ping G-5 9 iron. This makes it very difficult for her to break her wrist properly on the back-swing. I will propablely end up putting this set in the closet until she grows a little bit more and shopping localy to find a junior set that is more proportionate."
1,Useless,My roommate and I tried to use these and they did not highlight the things you should really know. You're better off making your own flashcards off of your MCAT books.
2,works but not sure if this is 50W,"My wife took it to Europe and she was going to use it with battery chargers for camera and for her hair staightener which is 35W. With battery chargers it worked fine, but while using it with hair straightener there was smoke comming out of this transformer so i'm not sure if this is 50W transformer, be carefull."
5,Police Cat is a Winner,"This book is a must for children and cat lovers of all ages. Police Cat combines an action packed yet heart warming story, with absolutely beautiful and expressive illustrations. I will treasure this book always."
1,This is NOT LOVE ME DEADLY!,"This is DEAD RIOT, and not the classic necrophile love story LOVE ME DEADLY! It has been misfiled and people looking for this specific title have been sent this instead!"
3,WW2 Espionage in Ankara...,"An interesting look at a little known chapter of WW2 espionage. Moyzisch was a German attache in Ankara. He was approached by a man claiming to be the British Ambassador's valet, who offered to sell classified British documents. The Germans bought the documents with forged money. Curiously, they wondered if the documents were forgeries. They weren't. Former Ambassador Franz von Papen has written an introduction in which he urges the reader to take Moyzisch's account seriously."
5,Got pagemaker 7.0?,"If you are a small shop and are tight on money.. forget it. it you have some extra cash, pagemaker 7 tackles a few of those bugs that 6.5 has.I love pagemaker and if you want a great program, do not pass this up!"
5,gui programming on the go,"Before I picked up this book I knew nothing about GUI programming, but a good bit about Python. This book let me jump right into writing useful GUI's. Typical programming text books build on concepts sequentially, which is great for classrooms but not for learning on the fly. This book just jumps right into applications and teaches through examples. I was so impressed by this method that I plan on buying more books from the in action series whenever I need to learn another programming language. This book has been my #2 resource right behind Google, which is saying a lot."
4,"The only ""one stop"" source for wxPython information.","This is the best book you can get for wxPython programming. The alternative is to jump around the Internet on a scavenger hunt, picking up little bits here and there, all out of sequence - you can do it, but it's not worth the time.The price is typical for programming books, and easily worth it for a professional programmer like me. I used an on-line version for about three days, at which point I realized that it was available as a paper book. I ordered it right away. The paper book is easier to use, and includes good illustrations and examples.""WxPython in Action"" is suitable for beginners and old pros. The examples are detailed and progress step by step. Full source code is available for download from the publisher's web site.""WxPython in Action"" covers the wxWidgets GUI system as implemented in Python. It is not a Python tutorial. If you are new to Python, I recommend also purchasing ""Learning Python"" by Lutz."
3,Not many choices for WxPython books,This book is hard to use as a reference but it is better than nothing.
2,Encore un autre moraliste...,"Ok, the book must be praised for its lucidity. The style too is not bad - it accomplishes something that is most difficult while dealing with philosophical subjects: to be clear whithout being shallow. I could even call it a great book (and give it more stars) wasn't for the hypocritical conclusion that ruins everything that was written before.""Il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux"" Yeah, right."
1,hard to follow,"I loved the Stranger and the Fall, and so I bought this book. However, it is hard to follow and does not have good organization (arguments, conclusions, ...)."
2,Enough to Push You over the Edge...,"To use a euphemism, intellectual masturbation. Did the writer really expect this essay to actually connect with and help anyone? According to Camus, the world is nonsensical, we all die, dead is dead, no afterlife, and we leave no lasting impressions when we go. But if you live life ""to the fullest"" spending your time like an actor playing different roles, or, if you get a bird's eye view of your daily grind, and realize how pointless your life is, you will then be happy and content. A complete non sequitur. From what i've read Camus lived anything but a cloistered life, but this ""cure"" to suicidal ideation is written from the perch of a study or a library, not of real concrete life. I used to work in the mental health profession, and if a client came in to me as a threat to him or herself, and i gave them this essay, i would soon be out of a job."
3,Hard on the Head,This book may be brilliant but I had a hard time understanding the essays. I found Camus' ideas more clearly expressed in The Stranger and The Plague and would recommend readers obtain these works first. One positive of the book was that it pointed me to the works of Kafka - which helped me understand this work better.
3,"Just a few thoughts, not an actual review","...First of all, coming off of THE STRANGER, the incredible generalities spewed in this book are pretty thick and tough to comprehend. Camus uses the term ""lucid"" over and over, but his book is anything but. The titular essay, spanning roughly a 100 pages, has its moments and flashes of brilliance, but much of it, in the opinion of this public-school jackass, could be easily excised with no loss to anybody. The sentiments, and Camus' philosophy, emerge loud and clear, but they are covered up in unnecessary dross.The other essays do not elucidate anything in particular, and they can be even hazier. Overall, it becomes increasingly more and more frustrating...especially when we reach the point when Camus begins pining for Greek sculpture, which fits in with no other part of the essays. It's a useful explicit statement of beliefs, but it's not much as writing."
3,Review of The Myth of Sisyphous by Albert Camus,"This essay was a struggle to read at times (hence, the three star rating), but I hung in there and was glad I did."
3,disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the obscure passages that lack clarity. If you purchase this book I suggest also getting a study guide that translates what Camus is trying to convey in The Myth of Sisyphus. I did experience moments of deep understanding and enlightenment; unfortunately, these moment were rare. I gave this book three stars because I have read Camus' work in the past and I really respect what he has to say when he's not being vague. I also appreciate those rare moments of enlightenment."
3,Deep thoughts,"I've read this before in high school, and this was a present. Presents interesting ideas without the dryness of Sartre."
4,"Fun, Spanish sensory book...watch out for the sticky pages!","This short book is entirely in Spanish. It is a lot of fun as your little one can touch the faces of each of the animals to feel different textures...""los besitos rasposos de los gatos"" (scratchy cat kisses) feels like sandpaper and ""besos peludos de los osos"" (furry bear kisses) has a fuzzy fabric feel.I'd give it five stars except that the ""besos pegajosos de los perros"" (sticky dog kisses) unfortunately makes that page stick shut. It's not a big deal. I'd still buy the book again, but it is a minor inconvenience.Overall, a short, fun book that lets your child really interact with each page."
3,this bakeware is NOT leakproof,"I thought the construction of this pan is very nice, however I attempted to make a cheesecake with a recipe that recommended baking it in a water bath to avoid cracking. I had my doubts about ""leakproof"" and it proved true. I even wrapped the pan in one seamless sheet of heavy duty foil. The crust and the cheesecake were a soggy mess as water seeped into the pan. I had to throw it out. I would recommend the pan but the claim of being leakproof is not valid."
5,"""M""pire","I ordered these fun guys as I have collected all the rest of the ""M""pire M&M characters. I was glad to finish the collection with new ones, they came in just a few days with ground shipping and in excellent condition."
3,This is what I get for buying the cheaper product...,"I chose this one because it was the only one that said that the drinks didn't leak and it was more modestly priced. I certainly got what I paid for... The Bar Butler came with two of it's dispensers broken beyond repair (because if fixed one would leak and the other wouldn't hold the bottle's weight), the pieces were of a cheap plastic... It came halfway assembled but with no instructions to assemble the rest. It looks cheaper than it does in the picture and to make matters even worse I was dumb enough to buy two of them... at least I can make one whole bar butler mixing and matching the pieces from both butlers, to make a whole one that kinda works."
3,Leaking,"I read lots of good reviews about this product, so I bought 3 of them. However, the result wasnt good as i expected, after one week usage, one of the dispensers began to leak, so I cannot use one of the stations."
1,Arrived broken,Got this as a gift to a friend. Had it shipped right to his house. It arrive broken in several places. I was gonna replace it for him but he said not to bother - it seemed of cheap construction and he predicted it'd break eventually anyway.
4,Liquor Carousel,The seller was fast and efficient. The product came in less than a week and was packaged nicely so nothing broke. I recommend this seller and product.
2,Bland in the historical department,"For a book advertised as being historical fiction, I found it truly bland in the historical department. Little cultural details are mostly absent. Common terms are often used (such as rice wine, instead of sake), which when combined with dubious details (such as large amounts of ""fruity"" wine being drunk, modern-ish character traits, etc.) makes the novel seem like it could be set in just about any generic ""historical"" time period or place. To me the story seemed almost completely devoid of a specific cultural setting.If you are looking for a decent mystery story, give the book a try. If you are looking for good historical fiction of ancient Japan, look elsewhere."
1,The CD does not work!,This CD stopped working after running it the first time on my laptop. Since there is no way to get a replacement I am forces to have a useless CD.
2,some data wrong,"There are errors in data, for example the vin breakdown on 1970 Camaro incorrectly states that the six digit is the assembly plant. There are others as well. The previous edition was more accurate."
5,finally find a wallet I wanted,"Before I bought this wallet, I had been looking for months for one that I liked. I wanted something to which I could attach a chain, but which wasn't some lame ""biker wallet"" with ridiculous graphics. This fit the bill perfectly. I wouldn't recommend it if your wallet looks like George Costanza's, but you can easily fit 6 cards, an ID, and several bills, which is about how much I have. It's got a clean appearance and the material is high quality. The buttons are solid, and make a satisfying snap when you close them. The retractor, I wasn't so fond of. I attached my own low-profile chain instead with a belt clip that also holds my keys ($1.19 at Lowe's, I highly recommend it)."
4,ALMOST Perfect Wallet,"I bought this wallet for my husband since he needed something durable, lightweight and something he could attach to his belt and not loose.. It was ALL Of those and he loves this wallet.. the only thing that needs improvement is they need to design it to where it will hold just a little bit more and still close well.. once you get your license, credit cards and money inside, it better be limited or your wallet will NOT close well.. my only complaint"
5,Awesome product....,Purchased this for my nephew. So far he loves this wallet. I have the kevlar version with the clip. Civilian has a great line of high quality products. My wallets usually don't last and wear out. So far the civilian lab wallet is still holding out. What is cool about this wallet is that it has two magnets to keep your wallet closed. The kevlar version has velcro and the noise can get annoying at times. Overall great products from Civilian.
1,poor quality,"The material scratches cc so bad they only last 2-3 months before unreadable. The magnet catch has already torn off. The retractable device is more of nuicesnace than anything elese, it is bulky and makes grabing your wallet even harder.Customer service ??????????????? where are you. Do not buy."
3,Build is good but quality control needs to be addressed.,"Purchased this for an upcoming trip to Asia. I like it's build, size, looks, materials and functionality. It would have been perfect if a stricter quality control is made before packaging. The lower right corner where you place the credit cards is badly deformed from the stitching. It was pretty bad and I would have returned it for an exchange but my trip is coming up in a few days. I was hoping that it'll straighten when used but it's not. Here's a picture of what I'm talking about... [...]Like I said... I like the wallet alot and will not hesitate to recommend it to friends."
2,Needs a non-leather option,"Many people object to wearing leather, and I am one of them. I will buy this product when it's full plant or synthetic materials."
3,old-fashioned anthology ignores integrity,"No anthology can be complete, but Untermeyer provides a good overview of English language poetry. However, I cannot trust the accuracy of the anthology. Untermeyer uses the altered versions of Dickenson's poems. It is difficult to say what else he may have changed."
5,Art of Colonial Latin America,Great book for a really broad overview of Latin American art. Gives a brief introduction to Pre-Colonial Latin American art as well.
4,A more realistic account of the Border War,From most things written about the border partisans from Missouri you would think that one day they just decided out of now where to kill innocent men and boys and burn Lawrence to the ground. This book shows how Lincoln created the tinder box by giving legitimate jobs in the Army to the thieves and murderers from Kansas who used abolition as a premise for wholesale pillaging of the western missouri countryside. The actions of the jayhawkers and redlegs did more recruiting for the southern cause than could have been done by any other method. Giving legitimacy to outlaws who only followed the rule of law when it suited them set this part of the nation to flame. Neither side was innocent by any means - and this book provides a more realistic and historically contextual account of this unfortunate and violent period.
3,An apologist for the secessionists...,"Gilmore's book rightly covers the time period before 1861, as well as after, and he notes that history is written by the victors. But instead of offering a more balanced view of both sides of the border war, he becomes an apologist for the secessionists and rides the pendulum in swinging too far the other way. Of course, since I live in Lawrence, Kansas, I have a hard time feeling sorry for Quantrill! Gilmore's references to other conflicts in history don't always work, either. Instead of comparing Missouri bushwackers to U.S. troops in Vietnam, he should have referenced the VC and NVA. Gilmore's own ancestors may have worn blue, but he sees everything through gray eyes. This actually obvious in the title of the book, since it says the Missouri-Kansas border, instead of the more common and alphabetical Kansas-Missouri. Which came first - the border ruffians or the Jayhawkers?"
1,Defense of the Slavocracy,"A preposterous defense of the slaveocracy and apology for the actions of the armed thugs of the latter in Kansas. Fortunately for our nation there was a John Brown, a Garrison, a Frederick Douglas and others who defeated these backward slaveholding wanna be lords with their English and French allies and strengthened the American nation. These things helped to keep all the Americas free from European colonialism by the way."
4,Geography in Civil War On the Missouri-Kansas Border,"On p.268, Gilmore has Wellington in Johnson CO. It is, in fact, in Lafayette CO., west of Lexington.On p. 283, Gilmore has the location of Bill Anderson's death in Albany, MO. That is true, but this Albany is a small unincorporated community. It is not on any modern maps.(The Albany in the far North part of the state is a different Albany.) Anderson was killed just west of Richmond, MO. where he was taken to be buried. Anderson's grave is just north of the square in Richmond, the county seat of Ray CO. Ray CO is not near St. Joseph, in the extreme NW part of the state where Gilmore places it. Richmond and Ray CO are just north of Lexington across the Missouri River, way SE of St. Joseph."
2,didn't work!,"My daughter, for whom the watch was purchased for, liked it but it didn't work. I took it to purchase a new battery but the old battery tested fine. I was able to return the watch with no problem whatsoever with no shipping costs. Fortunately, I hadn't adjusted the band. Personally I thought the watch was bulky."
3,helloooooooooooooooooo!!!!,"look, i'm all about [tracks]......BUT THIS CD IS UNMIXED. WHY DO REVIEWERS SAY STUFF LIKE--> ""banging from beginning to end"" ???the [tracks] are pretty good and all, but I want something that is MIXED(!!!!) from ""beginning to end"". sheeesh!~oidfopvgija"
2,Video is too different than the original story.,I thought the video should have portrayed the original storyline. It gets drawn out in parts and isn't suited for very young children (2-4 years). Some parts are pretty scary. I really didn't like the video and wouldn't recommend it.
3,Not much different from all of the other books,"There isn't much to say about this book. If you've read other management/leadership books, you won't find anything different or remarkable in this one. If this is the only management book you read, I suppose it might help you some."
4,leadership,"this is a great book from both a leadership and a suboordinate perspective. Obviously more from a leader mentoring lesson, but there are so many good lessons from someone that seem to have been there."
5,sledgehammers: strengths & flaws of tiger battalions,"great book, this is second one i got. first one i lost after barely reading it. love it. good stories about how individual units lived & fought"
5,Good Product for my uses,I only purchased this to clean my drains on my 2008 Mazda Miata. I have no clue how it cleans a trombone or any other musical instrument. For cleaning my drains this tool did a great job and I would recommend it to anyone who ones a Miata as the drains do tend to get clogged rather easily and this product makes the job substantially easier. Image was a bit misleading as I thought the coil was going to me metallic in nature and when it was arrived it was covered in black vinyl and the spine was metallic. Obviously this discrepancy wasn't an issue given my use for the product so I give it 5 stars.
1,Trombone slide flex brush,"In looking at the picture of this brush set, it looks very long. When I got it I was so very disappointed. It only reached down to the bottom of the outer slide and wasn't long enough to make the curve and come back through the other side. And the brushes weren't very big so it didn't scrape the tube slide for a good cleaning. I would not invest in this."
5,schoolhouse Brides,"This was a very good book,I wasn't familiar with this writer,but she makes an impression in this book"
1,"""Picture-Rolling"" Problem","Bought Director's Cut Take 2 in 2004. The problem is that about 10 minutes into capturing analog video the picture starts to roll, like VHS with tracking problem.Support response time is excellent, but after over a year of correspondence and 2 free firmware updates, the problem ramains.I do not see any more need to buy capture devices now. The newer versions of video cameras have ""pass-through"" utility that can be used to capture analog videos."
3,"great pans, cheaper elsewhere","The pans themselves are great, if you are a cook who knows why they want stainless rather than non-stick, this is a good choice, and nobody else offers a sauce pot at 4.5 quart capacity, that item alone is worth getting the set for. BUT: you can get this set for $320 at bed bath beyond if you have one near you. Amazon is usually $400 (or $350 for marketplace)."
3,This is nice cookware but you can do better.,"In purchasing my cookware, I tried several brands. I have an All-clad sauce pan and also tried out a Calphalon Try-ply skillet (along with a few others including copper). Well the Calphalon is good and if you got it as a gift you should be pleased. However if your out looking to buy a nice set, get the Cuisinart Multiclad - this is not the more common Classic Chef series. I got the Cuisinart Multiclad 12-pc set on sale at Dillards and I couldn't be more happy. The Cuisinart Multiclad is built the same way as the Calphalon Try-ply and All-Clad stainless. It has a nicer inside finish than the Calphalon, which means it cleans up better and sticks less. They all cook great but the Calphaon did discolor a bit. I'm just not impressed with Calphalon's products. If you want to go all out get All-Clad, But if you want a great set that cooks great, looks great and will last a very long time, get the Cuisinart Multiclad. The Calphalon isn't worth the extra money."
5,Stainless steel,I think these pans are great. If you follow the instructions in the pampflit to make foods to not stick it really works. And the clean-up is really simple an little warm water and a doby pad and some bar keepers friend you've got it made. They are great.I have never been more happy with a set of pans than these ones.
5,Great set of pans,One of the best set of pans i ever owened got tired of nonstick coated pans always peeling off after time only resulting in having to buy new ones. Stainless Steel pans are just as nonstick aslong as you use them as recomended buy the manufactor as far as amazon saying they go for 800 plus well 399 is the recomended price for the set of the manufactors web page if you shop around like i did i got them for 328.00 including shipping but a 5 star recommendatation for people thay are tired of the same old peeling coated nonstick pans that need to be replaced after a couple of years time after time.
1,Way overrated - Had this set for about a year,"The stainless steel is hard to cook in but as a warning beware of those lids. Two of them have already exploded on me for no apparent reason at all. I mean they literally exploded! I just don't get it. First time was a while back with one of the two large glass lids it comes with cracked on me, well kinda exploded into this large webbed glass. I thought it was a fluke until recently when I spent nearly 3 hours on some gumbo and the lid was not even completely covered! It exploded in front of my eyes, I could not believe it happened again. Pisser is that I spent all that prep time and it was gone to waste, had to order in. The lids are really terrible and this time a couple pieces of glass literally flew out hitting my kitchen wall and hitting me as well. I will upload a few pictures of the exploded lid. I am not even that upset at the fact that the lid broke, just that I spent all that time on food preparation.Calphalon graciously replaced my lids."
1,You need Cinderella to clean this cookware,"For 30 years I used a great set of Wear-ever All-Clad cookware. Last month I thought it was time to update so I read on line and visited the store to see quality first-hand.I purchased the Calphalon stainless steel Tri-ply 13-piece cookware set.Pots are very difficult to clean even with the recommended Bar Keepers and Dobie Pad. Lids are very difficult to clean due to pieced design. Everything spots these pans--oatmeal, tea, steamed vegetables.The lid handles and pot handles get very hot. You must always use a pot holder. The pot handles slip and twist in your hand (potholder) when you are pouring anything weighty, like three cups of popcorn. Handles are poorly designed, style and composition.One star because the food does cook and the pots were pretty."
2,Not what we expected,"We did a lot of research before buying these. We like how they heated evenly, were pretty and were super solid and heavy. However, all the food sticks to it! The worst part (why we are sending them back to the store today) is that after ONE washing (one by hand AND one in dishwasher)they have become ""rainbow"" looking inside. The one put in the dishwasher has gotten pitted and looks like its totally ruined.We are sad about this.. however the brand is a good brand so we'll prob switch to the non stick ones"
3,Should have been better,"Bought a set for myself and my daughter. Very difficult to keep clean and bright. Things stick, pots discolor. For that amount of money, THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Yes, read the directions! Yes, followed the directions for cleaning and correct cooking methods. Yes, read all the reviews and followed their advice...but, am really sorry I bought them. Too much time and effort to maintain and use. (My daughter has had the same experience)...Thanks, but no thanks."
3,Calphalon Tri-Ply stainless steel 13 piece cookware set,"Looks great, cooks great. However, you CANNOT use any metal utensil stirring these stainless steel pots! They become visibly scratched! The pamphlet included DOES NOT state to use wood or plastic utensils. I called the warrantee people and was told that ""the scratches do not affect the cooking"", well, that's good, but they don't look as attractive as they first did. The scratches are there permanently now. If the pamphlet stated such before hand or if stated in the advertisement, I would have thought twice before spending a small fortune on these pots. Disappointed with deception"
2,Misleading title,Just so you all know the 4.2 oz is not cologne. It's an aftershave lotion and did not see this until I actually purchased it. Just be careful.
3,Picture is incorrect,"In the picture, this is a spray bottle, but when it arrived, it's actually a ""shake it on"" type bottle. I much prefer the spray.Smell is good... lavender and vanilla, but if you haven't already bought it, I can't imagine trying it ""for the first time"" on Amazon... for re-orders if you don't care about having the spray, this is a good option."
1,Mislead,"I was mislead. This is a lotion, not a spray as shown. I had previously purchased this product(it was an aerosol spray) and simply re-ordered it.Rathar than purchase it at Amazon,I will purchase this product at retail store in the future."
4,Excellent and concise,"I've found this book a valuable resource in developing a growth and strategic plan for my architectural firm. It is a short book and doesn't waste time in getting right to the point. However, I would like it to elaborate on a few items since my firm is young and I'm inexperienced in business. For those firm principals of small firms that have been in business for many years and are experiencing any trouble with the A/E business, this is a must read. My only complaint is that the section on Information Technology is not current enough. However, any hard copy of a book of this type would have trouble keeping up with the changing technology environment. Take time over a weekend or holiday to read this book!"
4,Best- seller book,"This book could be a best-seller because its written perfecly by the author and its about the 11-12 ages in a science classroom and just when bob goes to pour the chemical into the glass something goes horribly wrong. it is so good i wanted to read it twice. If you liked this book you would defenetly want to read the novel by: s.e hinton ""The Outsiders"". Anyway, This book should be made into a movie."
5,I love this book!,This is a great book!I have read it a least a dozen times and I'm gonna read it a dozen more!I never tire of the slapstick comedy this book contains!Louis Sachar is a genius and I hope he writes more Wayside school books.I highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes crazy books and kids that hate school and would like a view of it upside down without order just pure sweet chaos!And once you read one of the series you will be hooked and want to read more and more of the great Wayside series.So if you like books that are funny and give you a break from your bleak everyday life this is your book!
5,Totally funny!,I highly recommend this book ... great! If you don't like it you don't know what a real book is. It is a totally funny book! If you like action you should read the last chapter.
3,Laughing All The Way,This book is so funny! i would read it over and over again. However some parts were confusing. The stories are creative. I really wish i was in Mrs. Jewels's class. That would be so amazing. I wish there are more chapters so the book could be longer. Mrs. Jewel is a very weird teacher because she does not do any normal things a normal teacher would do.
3,A funny book!,This is a very funny book. There's lots of riddles. I think you should read this book because you'd laugh alot (Joie Converse age 8
3,Uhh...,"So I decided to go ahead and buy the book for pure nostalgic purposes as it was one of my favorite books when I was a kid. But to my dismay when I got the book I realized that they had changed it completely! The illustrations are all re-done and the book is literally half the size of the original, it's so tiny that it's uncomfortable to hold. The stories are all still there, and that's the most important part but I don't know why they had to re-vise it, the original artwork is how I remembered most of the stories. Oh well..."
4,A funny and weird story about school,"This book is about a school with a teacher who is not very smart at all. She says things like ""It matters what is on the inside"" but what she means is wearing expensive underwear. The kids love her because class is very easy. One teacher is on the 19th floor, but there is no 19th floor. This book made me laugh because school is usually serious and this was just really funny. I would recommmend this book to kids who don't like school because it might make them relax and see that school can be funny too. JG"
5,Student Review,I like all the books by my favorite author Louis Sachar and I think you will like books by him too. I think you will jump right into the book called WaySide School is Falling Down. Mrs. Jewls (is a teacher) and she has a real funny class. You will think it is so funny that it will make you fall right out of bed (if you are reading in bed). But if you read this book you will really love it. It is really funny so read it . Myron is a boy in Mrs. Jewel's class. He is the main character. He had a bird named Oddly. It was a bird that lived outside of the school. Myron would stay in for recess and feed the bird from his hand. It was funny because birds don't normally come into a classroom and eat out of someone's hand. So read WaySide School Is Falling Down it is really hilarious.By:Kayla N
4,the best,This book was funny and i'm the kid that loves these kind of books. I get so caught in the book that I start to imagine that im in the book and when its time for me to put the book down I wish that I had a school like wayside. This was the kind of book that you can enjoy this funny kid book. Thats why I love some of Louis Sachar books.
3,The strangest book ever!,Wayside school has the most weirdest kids you ever read about. One is Mac who likes to talk about himself and his life instead of the lesson. Paul was so crazy about Leslie's pigtails which makes no sence because it is just hair split in two.Why Kathy have to make D.J so misereble? Is she misereble herself and spred it. Paul was eating some food.....BUT WHY EVEREYBODY HAS TO STARE AT HIM WHILE HE'S EATING IT. STARE AT THEMSELVES EATING IT FOR CRUD'S SAKE! But still I like this book is best book in the world!
1,It's more weird Wayside School.,"This is the worst book i""ve ever read. I recommend it to everyone I dislike. If you read this book you must have brain damage (I know I do.)"
5,This book is cool,I think it was a good book because it had a lot of humor in it. I also liked it because every paragragh is a different story. I also think it was cool because of the magic parts. I think all people who are funny should read this book. I think this is a good book for all children
3,dumb shcools,In this book there are a lot of kids in this book that do the opposite of what anyone says. In this book there is a teacher that turns kids into apples. Should this teacher be trusted with children because she's crazy. I don't know why people are so dumb in this book but with dumb people it makes it funny.I liked this book because it did not make sense. And there was no such thing as a 19 story. I also liked it because I've read the series backwards I really recommend.
5,Wayside School Stories,Wayside School is the weirdest school it is thirtys stories high.It has one clssroom on each story. There is this teacher named Mrs.Gorf she is the meanest in wayside school.And who ever did something bad she would turn them into apples cause she loves apples. An Mrs.Gorf turned everybody into an apple.Then Louis picked up an apple that was really Mrs.Gorf and ate her.Then another teacher came into the classroom the next day her name was Mrs.Jewls. She was their new teacher since louis ate Mrs.Gorf.And you should read this book too.***
1,PESIMO,"Nunca espere encontrar un producto de tan pesima calidad en AMAZON. este CD esta probablemente grabado en una grabadora de cassttes viejisima. La voz del que habla es muy tediosa y los efectos sobre la voz son extemadamente amateurs. El sonido de background esta por completo fuera de contexto. Suena como si lo hubiera grabado alguien que no tiene nada que hacer en su casa. Probablemente el mensaje de este CD sea positivo, y la intencion de Carlos Gonzalez sea buena, pero la calidad del audio y la manera de expresarse esta muy por debajo de los standares de un paquete de motivacion que impide poner atencion al mensaje. Tuve que regresarlo. Lo siento. Pero por favor, cuando hagamos las cosas, hagamoslas bien."
4,nice and simple,"nice and simple. I got my product in a timely manner at a good price. I will say the wrist part is small and the wrist cover comes off frequently, would be nice if it would stay on. But its not really a big deal."
3,bad-okay,pretty good slingshot for the price.when i got it the rubber hose was dried and ripped so i had to buy an all new one.but i only had to pay 5 bucks so wasnt expecting much
1,The slingshot broke the first time,"I bought this slingshot as a sales gimmick combination purchase to go a high limb chain saw. It was not for a toy. It was a good idea to make the combination offering. The slingshot could have made it easier to get the rope over the high limb.However, the slingshot was not adequate for the task. It is indeed built as a toy. It broke into four pieces on the first shot! I was frustrated. I used a weight on the end of a string and slung it around and over the limb. Yes, it did take more then a few tries, not having a working slingshot."
1,beware and boycott,This piece of crap broke after the first use. The manufacturer ought to stand in front of it and be a target -- and he'd never get hurt because it would break first.
3,slingshots,I ordered 10 slingshots. Two of the slingshots were broken and unusable when they were received and had to be returned for a refund. The other 8 slingshots were fine and worked well.
3,Too Small,"Make sure you have skinny wrists when trying to wear. Bracket is very small, hand grip as well. Still very fun to play with!"
2,Get what you pay for,It's only 5 bucks so you can't have high expectations. Too small for anyone but a small child to fit their arm through. Elastic ripped after 10th pull. Spend the extra bucks if you want something reliable.
3,not wide enough!,"I like everything about this thing, except that it's not wide enough across the ""Y"", messes up the aim completely!!!"
1,came broken in box,This toy didn't even arrive in one piece so I would have to say that it is not durable in the least.
2,"Fun, but fragile","My husband was excited to receive this, but after using it only twice, the wrist support broke. Dealing with that, he used it only twice more, until the rubber sling broke free from the frame. Fun, but breaks way too easily."
1,its a rip off,when i got it the sling was ripped and i had to get a new one and after that the rubber part broke i wouldent recomend it.
2,Breaks easily,"When I used it the appropriate way by sliding my hind thru, it instantly broke in my hands as i was pulling back lol, luckily it was cheap. i just glued it back together"
1,Garbage!,These are Terrible! I bought these as gifts for afew close friends of mine expecting them to be half of the one i have. I purchased 3 of these. All 3 of there bands broke the First time they were pulled and the handles werent even together all the way. DO NOT PURCHASE!
4,Not Bad,"Was looking for a near professional slingshot, I got more of a child's toy but still not bad for a little over 4 bucks. Slight damage on the elastic but overall not too bad for a rather cheap thrill."
1,A piece of JUNK!,"This slingshot is a piece of JUNK! - It broke 3 times, the first ~3 uses. The handle broke twice and then the rubber strap broke, rendering it useless. Thankfully, Amazon has an awesome return policy."
2,Rubber band split before using,I noticed that the rubber band has split where it attachs to the metal - I have only test pulled it a few times - and didn't think any were excessive.
2,"Broke the very first use, then broke again in a way in which it was useless","I bought this not realizing how poorly made it is. The quality is really low.When I first opened it I tested it using the wrist brace, and it literally shattered into hundreds of pieces, the plastic holding the screws in broke. It was still functional for it's intended purpose, but I had to duct tape it. I then used it for maybe 20 or so times, and the piece holding the rubber band on completely snapped, and almost hit me in the face.I want my hard earned money back."
3,"better than ""leonard pt.6"", but what does that mean?","i bought this on a whim, after seeing it spurred a nostalgic daydream of how much fun i had with my old slingshot when i was a kid. as it was less than renting a movie, i bought it.thank god it was cheap.it was a lot of fun, and i enjoyed re-learning to shoot, but it broke after maybe 2 dozen launches. the tension from the strap being pulled back split the slingshot along the seam. bummer.but, it was enough to let me know that maybe i wanted to invest a little more money in a higher-quality model. and i suppose that's good.i've had less fun activities cost much more money and last an even shorter time.i'm looking at you, jim jarmusch."
1,Does not last long,"This Sling shot did not last a month!It's a poor design. Especially the rubber and the way it is mounted...( it broke in 3 weeks)! The ""Arm Rest"" is useless.This is the first item I purchased from Amazon That was Useless.I simply threw it out.Thank YouW.A.Nicholas"
1,broke :(,This is an awesome toy for a great price but it broke the first time we used it. Sent it back for a refund. Still waiting to receive.
1,Pure Junk,Don't waste your time. This is complete junk. My 8 year old grandson tried it and it broke on the 3rd pull. The rubber snapped. Cheap is the only attribute of this item. I just tossed it in the trash.
2,cheap slingshot,"Price is ok, but the slingshot is very cheaply made. It wouldd make a nice gift for a small child!"
2,Just a kid's toy,"It's apparent from the photos, but I overlooked how narrow the wrist armature is. To grasp it I have to rotate my wrist sideways to slip it between the metal arms then straighten so the strap is over top of wrist. Definitely designed for a child's hand not an adult's.The rubber tubing is soft and flimsy so it is not possible to pull really hard for much power. Even a child can probably pull hard enough to break it over time, sort of a designed-in power governor for older children tempted to shoot far or hard. For an adult this is only marginally useful for target practice and not much good for dealing with problem birds as I had hoped."
4,Great beginner book!,"Jan Foulke knows her dolls and provides interesting information about chinas. A great variety of chinas are presented, broken down by decades, from 1840's through 1930's. Photos provide side-views of fancy china heads for comparison of hairstyles. Basic information about manufacture, characteristics to look for when collecting and things to watch out for. A section is devoted to frozen charlottes. She also mentions Clear dolls and Ruth Gibbs dolls. Most photos are close-ups of the face/head, not full-view with clothing for those who are looking for costuming ideas. The only complaint is that the book is just too short!! Nice basic beginner book for the new china doll enthusiast."
5,A Must for Every China Doll Lover,"What a wonderful book! Jan Foulke has outdone herself in this guide to china dolls. As a collector who is just tip-toeing into the world of these beautiful dolls, I was delighted to come across this helpful book. Ms. Foulke's book is filled with loads of details on identifying and dating your chinas, as well the most incredible photographs. The close-ups and comparisons of hairstyles of the various periods are invaluable to the new as well as the experienced collector. Having collected antique dolls for over 20 years, I was very familiar with the basics of china doll collecting. This book however, educates the collector in the fine art of collecting the china doll. If you don't absolutely love these dolls when you open the book, you will definitely want at least one for your collection by the time you finish!"
4,good hose reel,"I've owned this hose reel for about 10 years now. I use it frequently during my shop usage time which is usually three or four days a week. It works well and has been smooth in operation both extending and retracting the hose. I replaced the hose after about five years as it was starting to crack. I've replaced a small external spring that helps lock the hose into a set position and I just replaced the an internal o ring that had dried out and cracked,causing an air leak. These were fairly minor fixes so I'm hoping now that we will be up and running now for another ten years. Considering that I purchased this reel at Costco for under $50.00 I'd say I got my moneys worth."
3,Good for the price,"I bought this as sort of gag gift for my sister. It works fine, no batteries or money required. My only complaint is that I thought it was a little bigger. It is a bit small but overall, good product."
1,Slot machine,"This was a last minute ""just for fun"" Christmas gift. It was really fun for the short time it worked. It broke after a couple days. Would not recommend."
3,Good but drags a bit,"This works best if you are a fan of all or most of the stars of the Golden Age. If you are only interested in one or two, you will probably get bored. It's a little sad to see the stars older and heavier than in their heyday, although the worst problem for me was having them do their segments in the MGM graveyard. This undercuts the film's nostalgic intent, because it's depressing to see those shabby abandoned sets. But it still has its good moments. I liked having Liza Minelli do the tribute to her mom and dad, and Fred and Gene introducing each other's films."
5,Greatest Galaxy Of Stars In A Film,"Well not so strange really, since it i s a compilation film. But it is produced with delicate taste by Jack Haley and it is insanely inspired. It`s(almost always)better to see this film than sleeping through some horrible storylines in order to see great musical numbers. Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Esther Williams are the true stars of the film."
5,They don't make 'em like this any more!,"When MGM decided to celebrate its past with a star studded documentary no one could conceive that the film would ultimately become the biggest box office draw of that year. With ""more stars than there are in heaven"", That's Entertainment! is the first and the best of the self-congratulatory tributes to the great MGM musical. Featuring clips from nearly 100 movies this is definitely a must have for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Featuring cameo co-hosting turns from everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Bing Crosby and with charming, if scripted, tales of ""the good ol' days"" in the words of George and Ira Gershwin, ""Who could ask for anything more!"" Enjoy this blindingly all star treck into a land over the rainbow that sadly, is very much a part of the past. One only hopes that Warner DVD will consider giving us this wonderful cornicopia in a newly remastered digital transfer very soon."
5,Expand the Mac!,"Virtual Game system is one of the best things to come to the Mac and Playstation. It works well with most American Playstation games and provides better quality than the Playstation overall. Worst part: will RARLEY lag on high perfomance games. But, this never really interferes with the game. It's a whole lot cheaper than buying a Playstation and it's worth the money with out a doubt!"
4,For people who can't buy the PS,Great! It plays playstation games. Oops! Only works on AMERICAN iMacs.
4,Awesome nu/alternative metal from Fates Warning Singer,"I haven't listened to the other albums before this from Engine, but my understanding is that this is an attempt to expand into alternative/nu-metal territory, compared to the progessive metal Fates Warning is famous for. Its very melodic and similar to some of the best modern nu-metal albums.If you are looking for classic Fates Warning - look elsewhere. Otherwise open your mind and prepare for a treat!"
3,Too small.,"We've had other ones like this before, and they're fun to play with. but these are a lot smaller and not quite as strong. I was a little disappointed."
2,Too Simple,"I was expecting this to be more complex than what it actually is, you can do some curious noises with it and no much more"
2,what is this,i wanted to buy the kid magnets for his birthday. but these were pretty boring. they are solid chunks and its a good thing because they are gonna get dropped when you try to do something cool like the picture and toss them in the air. I might have been using them wrong but these aren't that neat.
5,BuzzMagnets,"Bought this gift with a view of budget. Yet, it turned out to be one of the best purchases this season. Enjoyed each minute of watching the siblings bond through this experiment!"
5,Fun for everyone,"They are great to use as a de-stresser or to take your mind off of things, or even if you are bored! They buzz when you let them slide back together from the magnetism which is neat."
2,Buzz Magnets,These were supposed to be stocking stuffers for Christmas. They did not come in a package. They were loose in a box.
1,"If swallowed by sibling, they kill.","Before bringing these into your home, consider the following: The Consumer Product Safety Commission then reported 22 incidents involving the magnets from 2009 through October. ""Of the reported incidents, 17 involved magnet ingestion and 11 required surgical removal of the magnets. When a magnet has to be removed surgically, it often requires the repair of the child's damaged stomach and intestines,"" the commission statement said.Surgery was what was needed in the two most recent cases, both reported this month."
3,Did not meet expectations,"I first saw these magnets in Mexico when stopping there on a cruise. The magnets I bought online are not nearly as powerful as the ones I saw in MX. They look identical, just not as strong magnets. With magnets its all about the strength ,the magnetic force reigns. I can fairly say these magnets did not meet my expectations."
1,1 broke the first try!,I just received this today & 1 magnet broke the very first time I used it! I know it's only a $3 purchase but I expected to get at least some use out of it....what a bummer....
3,THE BUZZ MAGNETS ARE OUTSTANDING,"MY NEPHEW LOVED THE MAGNETS AND LOVE TO HEAR THEM BUZZ LIKE BEES.THE MAGNETS ARE REALLY EXCELLENT AND FOR ALOT OF FUN,THANKS!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I feel like an idiot for having bought these.,"They're supposed to do something, make noise? I don't remember. They're pretty useless really. They have served no purpose so far other than being cumbersome in that my nail clipper and cigar cutter keep sticking to them and I have to yank at them to get them separated when I want to use either. The magnets do have a strong, powerful magnetic field. What they can be used for may never be revealed. On the bright side, they weren't expensive, the financial loss was minimal to negligible but I still feel stupid having them. I might throw them away, I don't know."
4,Nice buzz,Kids having fun playing with it. Not a bad toy for such a small price. Will recommend. Can be a party favor.
2,Cheap version of good idea,"We have bought similar magnets in the past which proved to be fun and sturdy. Guess you get what you pay for. These took a little longer than expected to ship. I bought 2 sets thinking good ""filler"" gifts. Came bubble wrapped together (all 4 pieces of the two sets) so not presentable as a gift. I looked at my kids and said, well, looks like these are yours. My daughter was excited because she's seen her brother play with his (bought from different source, better quality) and wanted some. Upon first drop on floor, one of them split in half. Conclusion: Cheap version of a good magnet idea that is pretty entertaining and addictive to play with, just don't buy as a gift and ... don't DROP."
3,One magnet was dented.,"Recieved it today. One of them were dented though. Other than that, it's fine. If by ""maintains hold through hand"" means if you put one on the top of your hand and one on the palm, it'll stay, then it doesn't work. Other than that, all features stated worked. Satisfied!"
4,Brown rice fettuccini,"I am allergic to wheat so I purchase gluten-free products regularly. Rice pasta is sometimes hard to work with because it overcooks so easily and turns to mush. This brand holds its shape better than most but I still don't cook it as long as the directions say, and if there are leftovers, I wouldn't store them in the sauce. It tastes good and holds its shape better than others."
5,"My favorite GF ""long"" pasta","I am so pleased with this product. Unlike some GF spaghetti noodles I have tried, this noodle does not disappear into mush when I cook it. Has a nice flavor too! I use this noodle for spaghetti, carbonara, and fettuccini! Buonissimo!!"
3,"worth the money, even in low def","these games were great, especially since i was 5 and 9 years when the giants made their first two superbowl runs. but i am surprised how the nfl didn't clean up the video quality. otherwise, full 5 star rating."
4,Worth owning,"I've been a Giants fan for 50 years. That being said, I can't really complain about most of this set, however it would have been nice to have a game from both the Y.A. Tittle era and the Fran Tarkenton era. Perhaps nothing survives, but the Giants during Fran's time were a 7-7 team, but they sure were exciting. It would have been nice to have seen Tittle's game against the Redskins where he threw about a billion td passes. All in all a good set though. I especially love the Kerry Collins thrashing of the Vikings 41-0."
4,missing a few,Why not put the 2007 NFC Championship on here? Or the divisional win vs the Cowboys? Ok those are on another set.
4,football fan must,I'm not even Giants fan but any die hard NFL fan needs this set because of the history these games represent. They sould be called Giant killers--this set has the game that kept 49ers from being only team to 3-peat as well as the game that kept the '72 Dolphins happy (beating 16-0 Patriots). The price I paid thru Amazon was way more than worth it.
3,Only 500 minutes?,Road to SB XLII 5-disc set is 614 minutes--Either this is a typo or they really cutthese games down. Description says 10-discset is total of 500 minutes?!?!?!
3,"Non Fiction ? Eh; Maybe, maybe not","I read this when it first came out.I thought it was pretty good.But I've recently reread it and some other Luciano ""bios"" and I think I'm going to reassess it as semi-non fiction.Fun to read but accurate;? Of course most of the info in this book came from 'Charlie Lucky',sooooo-- Quien Sabe ?"
4,A tightly written work on how current reading pedagogy shortchanges students,"A taut, clearly written 'expose' of current methods for teaching reading (as well as teaching to the test strategies). Hirsch is compelling as he discusses how children actually learn language, oral and written and how we need to change the methods currently used to teach them.He does focus a great deal on his Core Knowledge foundation and its goals. However, as his arguments are so compelling, that is not a distraction."
2,Coverage is not standard for a discrete text,"I teach a discrete mathematics course at the college level and have examined many discrete mathematics books looking for a suitable textbook. Quite frankly, this one is at the bottom of my list of selections as a text. Set theory, logic and functions are not given separate chapters. The book starts with chapters on election theory and fair division, topics that are not generally considered within the venue of discrete mathematics.The chapters are:*) Election theory.*) Fair division.*) Matrix operations and applications.*) Graphs and their applications.*) More graphs, subgraphs and trees.*) Counting and probability.*) Matrices revisited.*) Recursion.While the material on matrices and graphs is suitable, the emphasis is too great. In my opinion, spending time on the applications in this book is not a suitable use of time. There are so many other, more critical topics that students need to be exposed to."
2,Not OS X Native,"Adobe has done very well with the OS X Native Photoshop and Golive applications. What were they thinking of when they released PM7? Personally, I'll never by another non-OS X native application."
1,The Age of Pagemaker is over,"When I first used (Aldus) Pagemaker, it was version 2. At that time I thought it was the best.A year later, I discovered QuarkXpress and nevered look back till now.Later when Aldus was bought out by Adobe, I thought it was going to get better for PM. It has and it hasn't.PM for years has always been second to Quark and when Adobe released InDesign 1.0, I knew it was the death knell for PM.Professionally, I'm now using InDesign v2.0 and have jumped on the Adobe band wagon aside its bugs.I do own a PM v 7.0 at home. It is an improvement, but a tactical mistake.Save your money for the upgrade and use it to upgrade to InDesign CS Pagemaker version. You will be pleasantly surprised."
3,Not for the intermediate student,"I've been painting a few years -- enough to know not to trust anyone who keeps using Alizarine Crimson! There were some basics covered (although apparently fugitive pigments don't bother her), but not covered as well as they are in other books. In any case, I'm beyond most of them. Could it work for a beginner? Maybe, but like I said, there are other books that cover the ""beginner"" questions better.At this stage in my painting, I'm trying to experiment with techniques to stretch myself and to help myself develop my own style. This book did nothing to move me along. The author's art is beautiful, but there are no lessons on how to try her techniques. Some of her work is mixed media, which is fine with me, but if you are a watercolor purist you won't want that either."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews I purchased one of these reels for our farm shop. I figured with the low price if it wasn't what most people claimed it wasn't a big loss. Overall the product seems to be well made but I found three things that I was disappointed in. 1. It's rated for 100' of 3/8"" air hose. Evidently that's not the heavy duy hose we use as I could only get about 85' of hose on the reel no matter how careful I was in winding it. Arms need to be about 2"" longer to give enough clearance for 100' of hose. 2. As mentioned in other reviews, it takes an adapter to screw the 1/4"" fitting common on 3/8"" hose into the 3/8"" fitting on the reel. Not a big deal for us as we have a larger supply of fitting on hand but would be an inconvenience for most. 3. The screw that holds the handle on backs out when winding up the hose. A left handed bolt would have eliminated this problem or do as I did & put ""Lock-tite"" on the bolt threads but don't ever plan on taking it apart."
5,GREAT ITEM BUILT LIKE A TANK. WILL LAST YEARS.,THIS GUY IS TOP NOTCH WORKS LIKE A CHAMP. BUILT LIKE A TANK. REAL HAPPY WITH IT FAST DELIVERY.IF YOU NEED ONE NO WORRIES BUY THIS GUY.
3,"Great for library media specialists, however...","I've used this book for the past 4 years with my K and 1st graders. It is very useful for teaching at the beginning of the year about bookcare. My ""however"" refers to the binding. Pages started to fall out my 2nd year using this book. That was after aproximately 10 readings. I am now on my second tape job, after another 10 readings or so. I was hoping that I'd find this library bound at this point, but it doesn't look that I way. I'll have to check into one of the re-binding companies (Turtleback, Permabound, etc) for it, I guess."
4,Real Life Story Hits Home,"This is a chronicle of the early years of WW2 as experienced by a Polish teenager. His arrest, torture and deportation to Siberia is followed by another major adventure in trying to reach the Polish Army in Uzbekistan.Aleksander Topolski's detailed, thorough descriptions of the people he encountered, the places he passed through and the experiences he endured bring this account alive.Personally, this book has allowed me to gain a tremendous insight into the experiences of my own father whose story is mirrored by this one.A highly recommended read for anyone interested in learning about the unbelievable Soviet regime of days gone by."
2,A Pain Beyond All Pain Unless You're Fluent in Latin,"I did not realize that aside from the English language, one would also need a Latin language background. Add to that the way Victorian/Edwardians translated stuff and you get problems when things like translating names add to the complications. For instance: when is a name not a name? Well, instead of translating a proper name such as ""Robert"" to ""Robert"", ""Robert"" is translated to ""Bright Fame."" Tack on other descriptiveness and you get a headache - ""His August Mighty Brightness met with Her Supreme Lovely Brightness"" and you get the idea. Two stars for effort but for the average ""Joe"" (or the meaning of Joseph is ""God shall add (another son)"") I'd pass this on by."
4,Like the copy pages,"I love the copy pages and maps in this book. Also, the suggested reading lists are very helpful as are the chapter questions and review. However, I find about 70% of the activities are too complicated for a child to complete, maybe even for an adult to complete. Even if you want to do the activities you need much planning time to gather supplies. Otherwise it's an excellent buy."
5,Great homeschooling tool....,We love this book! It has everything I could ask for in activities for our history studies (except someone else to teach it!) My daughter loves to do the map work and make crafts that correspond with her lessons!
5,Great shopping guide,"This book is great as a shopping guide and a shopping list for a new baby. It strikes just the right balance between not wasting money on useless products and spending money on useful products that go beyond the most basic things to make life easier. It also tells you how to allocate the money - when the cheapest product will do and when it is worth the extra dollars to buy the more expensive but also more functional product. In the latter cases the book offers brand or even specific product recommendations most of the time. As a bonus, the book is funny and enjoyable to read."
5,loved this book,"I have read sooooooooooo mnay baby books and this was one of my favorites-I learned so many tips. The book ""Baby Bargains"" is a must too-and I read that first-but all the ""gear"" I picked from that book she recommended also -so you can get buy with reading just this book-. I think a must for new moms."
4,"Fun to read, but short on info","In typical irreverant fashion, The Girlfriend's Guide was good for bunch of laughs and smiles preparing for a baby's arrival (always a good thing!), but I found the information a bit more skimpy than I had hoped. There are so many more products and categories out there that could have been discussed - and no, I'm not talking about ratings. What was there was good, there just could have been more."
3,Baby Bargains is a better buy,"This is a cute book with the typical Iovine charm, however, I think Fields' Baby Bargains, and now, Toddler Bargains are better purchases if you're really interested in what to buy."
2,Not great,"I read the Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy and thought this would be similar, but it came across as too stiff to me. It wasn't helpful either, a lot of the information is dated. Just not the entertaining, humorous read I was looking for. A disappointment."
4,Great purchasing guide.,I bought this book before my baby was born and referenced it many times while deciding what to purchase and register for. It has a great list of what you really need for your baby. It also suggest where to register and where to purchase things for your baby. As a first time mom I had no idea what a newborn really needed. The only reason that I gave this book four stars instead of five was because it was somewhat outdated. I would highly recommend this book to first time moms.
3,The Girlfriend's Gudie to Baby Gear,"Book was listed as ""like new,"" but was clearly an old copy with a worn cover with a bent corner. I purchased it as a gift and was embarrassed to give it."
5,"Fun, easy, informative read.","This is a great book for first time mom's. Its easy to read, short and to the point, entertaining and full of information and what you need, how much you will need and what you dont need.There are great overviews of different baby necessities and safety devices. As well as what you want to splurge on and what you can get away with skimping on.I would definately reccomend this to anyone who is about to venture into a baby superstore for the first time."
4,Amusing & useful,"I love reading her books, they're so entertaining. I bought this one a couple of weeks ago, along with the Baby Bargains book and Consumer Reports for baby gear. I thought it was a pretty good overview of what all you need and don't need. She doesn't go much into specifics of brands and items, which is where I find the Baby Bargains book useful. However, when she does, it's interesting to see what Baby Bargains and CR thinks of the same items. Overall, I'd recommend it as a quick read for getting an idea of what you need. But for specifics as to what to add to your registry, I'd depend more on Baby Bargains."
4,Very good book for a new parent!,"I am due in December and I wanted to get a headstart on researching baby products. I am a new parent, fresh out of college and married, and I was very apprehensive about what products to buy on a limited budget. This book is very helpful and categorized very well and loaded with major educational websites and emergency numbers every parent should have. Very thorough on how to baby-proof and prepare your home as well. If anything, take this book with you when you go to register!"
2,Good if you have lots of money,I found that Baby Bargains was a much better guide... a lot more prducts to choose from.
4,The Girlfriend's Guide to Baby Gear,"I loved it! It was so helpful, I was able to decide on things that were necessary, instead of getting bogged down by all the things that are out there."
1,save your money....,"application was for a 99 Toyota Tacoma V6; the mileage didn't change a bit (it's been steady at 19.7mpg -combined city/highway- since new, 135K ago... with or without the K&N;).The biggest disappointment was the supposed ""10% increase in HP"". Unlike the mileage, I have no way to measure HP increase, other than to say it feels absolutely no different than it did before. The only difference at all to my truck is the sound of the air intake... which I suspect is all that my $321 bought.I'm afraid I wasted my $$$, but -as they say- ""live and learn""."
2,Expectations not realized,"I had hoped for 1 to 2 MPG improvement. Increased power was not what I was looking for. My MPG stayed the same. FYI, we log all fill ups into a spreadsheet which calculates the MPG. Basically wasted my $."
1,Terribly misleading publication,"I have never seen a book on the subject of questioned documents with this many errors. The pathetic grammar is bad enough but not dangerous. The technical errors in this book, and there are dozens, are dangerous for novices who might not know any different. Avoid this book like a contagious disease. There are valid, professional books on this topic by Ordway Hilton, Wilson Harrison, Roy Huber, Albert S. Osborn and others. I wish you allowed negative ratings, because 1 star is not nearly low enough for this book."
1,"This book contains many spelling, grammar and content errors","There is useful information in this book, but there are also many errors. Someone new to the field would have no way to know which information was reliable and which was not. ..."
1,Caveat Emptor! Errors rampant.,"This book is so full of errors and unintelligible passages that it should be avoided by the naive and curious (in case you believe the information) or the experienced (who probably already know not to waste their money). Occasionally, the book is unintentionally funny. After all, how often can you find a book that provides erroneous information AND is badly written? Both thumbs down. Unfortunately, there is no choice in the field for minus 5 stars."
2,ok. just ok.,"i agree with the other reviewer...it's not worth the price. i wasn't impressed with it, although i would prefer it over cheapie drugstore brands. but this doesnt stand out."
2,Overpriced,"For someone with chronic dry/chapped lips I decided to shell out the extra money to see if it was really worth it. If it were to work, I'd gladly continue to pay more if it satisfies my need. This product fell way short of expectation. It worked no better than my $1.97 product. Something else that was a little annoying was that the letters on the tube would peel off and stick to my hands. The product had a pleasant smell and did not taste bad, it did what it was supposed to do but no better than what I can get at my local super store. Save your money. However, if you're the type that enjoys spending extra for the name, this product is for you. Just don't really use the product as the name will quickly come off."
2,just barely okay,The product is not much more than menthol-infused vaseline. Must be reapplied frequently. Waste of time and money.
3,decent,"I'm not a a huge paintball person but i decided that my marker deserved a solid case to protect it and that looked cool to carry with. This case has tough outer material that will protect it from pretty much anything you keep in your trunk along like tire irons and other random crap. The handles are flimsy but durable. The interior is very basic. It has extra strong Velcro strips of different sizes that stick to the cushioning. but these make putting the marker back a task. you place the strips around the gun in whatever design will work best. aside from the Velcro its padded very well. but there's no place to fit an extra barrel or any kind of accessories. its alright for an old gun to store for a friend i guess but for your main expensive, accessorized gun, this cases lack of a customizable interior doesn't cut it"
4,Small gift size breads,The right size for gifts in the form of banana breads or......... You do have to scrub them a little bit before the dishwasher.
1,Really a waste of money.,"Beware of authors who cannot spell ""degradation"" and beware of programmers who cannot write 6 lines of code that return what they say it will. There must be something better out there."
2,Not for the introductory user or the eager do-er,"This book is a good read for managers who want to know what ecommerce entails, not for the grunts who have to get the job done. The author offers a clear overview of all the issues you will encounter in tackling today's ecommerce systems. It does not give you a how-to and it will not get your store online in 12 easy steps. Don't be misled by advertising: there is no quick and easy way to get a credit-card enabled web-store up and running in the blink of an eye. It is a complicated process that requires considerable setup, management, programming and banking."
1,A carelessly published and aimless book!,"As I'm buying books to learn about the web technologies I intend to participate in, I have come across many excellent texts. This book, however, is chock full of typos, truncated graphics, and topics that don't add up to teaching me how to implement an eCommerce web site.After buying some other reference books, I needed a '2nd' reference and pulled out this one. I was even more dismayed than the first time I tried it after having sampled professionally handled texts.Don't waste your money. I am now leery of Wiley Publishing (if THIS could get past them....)"
2,Essentially a book of programming code and typos galore!,"This book claims to appeal to both novice and expert, but any novice wouldn't get past the first chapter. It is simply too complicated to understand or hold interest. It also doesn't give you a positive outlook on finding a host for your Web pages. And the typos in this book are innumerable! Good thing I know something about computers or I would be really lost!"
3,"A lot of fluff, some substance","Bought this on a whim. Like many business books, it offers a tantalizing insight into a successful person's life. But like many business books, it is long on broad, overarching concepts but short on actual reccomendations. I too can be a pundit and sagacious by saying, "" To make money, all one has to do is pick the correct stock and buy it."" - but without reccomendations on what that one might be, it is less useful advice.I think this is a useful book for someone who is in their mid 20's and is beginning to make their way in the world. The advice it offers about a constant state of change in the future is valid, but it doesn't offer much concrete information on exactly what to do with that information. An enjoyable read, but not a must-read or a first line book."
5,More than Investment Advice,"If you're looking for a ""how-to"" book to help you find your way in the new economy, there are countless insights in ""The New Normal"" that will help you understand the major issues facing investors today. If you are looking for an honest account of how an individual in his twenties with good instincts and a willingness to do research, created his own place in the world, this book is for you. What was valuable to me in reading ""The New Normal"" were McNamee's strategies for thinking outside the box, and his suggestions about how to develop a sound approach to entrepreneurship. The book also gives the clear message that technology IS the future. No matter what field you are in, there are ideas and points of reference here that will enhance your career and heighten your success. In this book, you will find no-nonsense, sound advice based on experience, intelligence and a genuine desire to help others achieve their goals."
3,Just OK,"Good insights, but you can get the same info from following Wired or Google News. The book just seems forced to me, as if the author had something to say in about a chapter or two and then just extended it several more chapters. Why spend $$...check it out from the library."
1,Waste of Money,"This product is a piece of junk!! Mine too fell apart. I didnt even have heavy cloths hanging on it. The plastic screw caps snap off and break just with standing. Even hanging socks is enough weight to break these caps off. Husband had to fix, renforcing them with screws. Today, thought I would give it a try. Only moments of hanging the cloths,it fell over and broke. The parts that my husband fixed, they remained in tack."
1,junk,"This product is even less than substandard. I tried to give it no stars. The plastic caps cracked and broke while we were assembling it-and there were three people holding it steady and level as we did so.Since I bought it at a home ""superstore"" that has declared bankruptcy, I am unable to return it. I would like to dump it on the company's front doorstep. I would still be out the money, but then I would feel like I made a point."
1,Listen to these reviews...this thing stinks!,"Not sturdy, broke within 2 minutes of putting clothes on it, took awhile to put together...I think that sums it up. This is not a good product; look elsewhere."
1,WORTHLESS JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this drying rack at a Linen's N Things and it was broken before my husband and I could finish building it. I brought the pieces back to the store and because they were going out of business, they wouldn't return the item. So now I am stuck with a $35.00 drying rack that ended up in my garbage can. Whoever designed the product needs to be fired. Using cheap, weak plastic screws to hold a steel frame is a fundamental design flaw. This product needs to be discontinued and stores should take it off their racks. I'm horrified to find it on Amazon."
1,History or Fiction ?,"Reynolds attempts to anchor the development of Dzogchen in history rather than myth and he fails. His style reminds me of a Christian fundamentalist - and I would bet that is his background - trying to prove the historical accuracy of Genesis. He has an answer for every issue critics and objective historians have raised regarding the origins of Dzogchen, its early documents and their authors, but almost all of those answers are unsupported by anything but conjecture and the pronouncements of lamas. If you are a true believer, this is probably the book for you. But if you would like something of substance that trys to separate history from fiction and partisan conjecture, I(...)"
2,Too thin for even cooking,"Bottoms are much too thin for even cooking. Even on lowest heat setting, things will burn in center. Copper bottom is nothing more than thin electroplate which flakes off after first use, as seen in my pictures. Other than that, the sizes are convenient, they stack nicely, and are handy in a pinch."
2,Cookset,"I returned this item for a refund. If you are looking to save weight than this is your item. Otherwise, far too thin and light weight for ""car"" camping"
5,Sooo cute,"I bought these shoes in brown, black and red...they are super HOT and look great too - they go perfect with skinny jeans, skirts or dresses, pants - anything. The only thing - if you are planning to purchase these shoes, make sure you are a professional heal-wearer because these babies are HIGH...and sometimes hard to walk in...I had no problem, danced in them all night - but I do wear heals on a daily basis! They are true to size, I wear a 8.5 and the 8.5 fits like a glove, however the toes are narrow and if you have wide feet- I don't recommend these. Overall, I LOVED THE SHOES and they look exactly as pictured."
3,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the 9th printing Daw November 1991 paperback editionCover art by Richard HescoxReturn once again to Darkover, the magnificent world of the Bloody Sun, with Marion Zimmer Bradley and the many writers devoted to expanding the Darkover universe as, in these all-new stories, they reveal legendry and lore about some of the most fascinating dwellers on Darkover, those gifted with laran, the magical powers of the mind which enable the leroni to raise and control natural forces, to communicate over vast distances, and to exercise countless other special abilities.From the founding of the Comyn Council to a Terran's first encounter with laran, here are spell-binding tales that will take you from the Guild House to Dry Town, from the Terran spaceport settlement to the heart of Hastur's Domain in this exciting new exploration of Darkover and its mysteries."
4,Essential Part of American History,"Best one volume history of American agriculture by dean of American agricultural historians; much superior to Danbom, Born in the County, which attempts a similar brief summary.Good bibliographies of additional readings. Although America was primarily an agricultual county for 250 years, most conventional histories ignore this fact. This book supply an essential missing dimentsion, although the reader still has to do a good deal of work to relate it to political,cultural, and economic history that was going on at the same time."
1,An irritating piece of software,"Frankly, it's very surprising that Adobe, a company that typically produces such powerful and elegant software, actually released something as bad as Pagemaker. There are so many things wrong with Pagemaker that it's very difficult to point out what's right. The biggest problem, of course, is that there are very few features, and the ones it has are clunky and frustrating to use. Designing something on Pagemaker is really an exercise in patience and irritation, because odds are if you want to do something to your page, Pagemaker can't do it. It is not surprising that Adobe chose to abandon Pagemaker upon the release of InDesign, which is a far more capable piece of software even at version 4 (CS2) than Pagemaker is at version 7."
4,Missing the dictionary,I have used pagemaker in the past and have enjoyed it. I was able to do a layout of the book I am writing plus it had spell check built in the one I just purchased does not.Its a lot easier than endisgn to use.
1,Return Product,"I have used PageMaker for many years. I love this program but since I installed this used disk, keep getting error messages. I think there is something wrong with the disk. I would like to return it and get my money back. Please tell me how to do this.B. Powell"
1,"Hey, what about Macs?","Apparently Adobe (whose products, I understand, were originally designed for Macs, or Apples), does not have a version of PageMaker for MOS X. Since I have used PageMaker for more than 10 years, and like it, I'm a little ticked!Unswerving MacWoman"
1,I would like to be able to do a review--but can't!,"I ordered this item on August 7th, today is Sept. 8th, my credit card has been billed, but I still do not have the product. I was eager to obtain this item since I've previously (and very happily) used an older version of Pagemaker on my Mac, and have lamented not having this software for my PC. My estimated 4 to 14 days cited in the order info has long passed, but I'm still patiently (?) waiting."
2,What a shame!,"I love Adobe products, and I use them for the vast majority of my work. This was the first time I've ever been dissapointed with a product from them.As other reviewers have mentioned, PM7 is very buggy and crashes often. One of the major reasons I purchased it was for its conversion abilities from QuarkXpress and Publisher. When it didn't crash (which was almost always) the results were not spectacular, and it was almost better to redo the projects by hand in PM7. What a waste of time.If you're a pro publisher, stick to Quark (especially since a new version will be out soon with merging and conversion capability). If you're a novice, go and buy the latest version of MS Publisher. You'll be better off!"
3,Quark Is Still Better,"I learned graphic design and layout on PageMaker, and wished Adobe would take the product seriously. Instead, PageMaker seems to be falling into the ranks of Microsoft Publisher as a program people use believing it'll do the job right.While many service bureaus still offer PageMaker services, it is by far better to go with Quark. It can do more, has more flexibility with printers and publishing houses, and will cause fewer problems regarding bugs and crashes.If you have PageMaker, don't upgrade. Do a little homework on Quark, and figure out how to convert your files with the newest version. It the short run, you'll spend a few more bucks, but in the long-run, you'll save time and frustration.I cautiously recommend PageMaker 7.0, but only as a tool for users intending to publish newsletters from their desktops.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
1,Can't get the product to load twice in a row.,"Add-ins won't load, too many typefaces on the computer. I have been trying to use this program for two months. Customer support is clueless, forums are like taking a problem to a committee. I am going back to version 6.5, and if I can prevent anyone else from wasting their money, all is good."
1,Cups burn your hands..DON'T BUY,I was very disappointed in this product. The tea strainer didn't go all the way to the bottom of the pot so you had to steep 3 cups at minimum. And the cups got so hot you literally couldn't hold them. By the time the cups were cool enough the tea was cold also. Contacted seller and they said they couldn't return it because it was used. Thanks for nothing. Spend your money wisely and buy a more expensive set. Total waste of money!
1,LASTED SIX DAYS,"I should be able to sue the company that manufactures this crap. After six days of use, the crutch went right through the rubber tip."
5,Good quality tip,These are a good quality crutch tip that wears well in out door conditions.Also good on slippery surfaces. Service was great.
1,Do Not Buy - They wore out in one week.,"I've been on crutches for more than 3 months, and it was time to replace my original crutch tips. The originals were still working, but much of the ""spring"" was gone from them.When these replacement tips arrived, I installed them and was impressed. They had a good spring, and I told my co-workers ""It feels like I'm walking on air! :)""But after 7 days of walking on these things, one of the tips had completely wore out! The metal end of the crutch had poked through the tip! The other crutch tip is almost as bad and will likely wear out in short order.I just hope I can get get new tips before I fall."
1,Why I hated my new crutch tips,I'm already using the second pair. The first pair came apart at the bottom and my crutchs came through and marred the floors. I will never buy products from Invacare again.
4,Color,I had ordered the gray crutch tips but instead received the beige color. Was disappointed but will not return - not worth the expense!
2,Not last long.,I used these tips and they wore out in a week. Not sure why because I've had ordered before and they would last months. I may have gotten a bad batch.
4,GOOD PIECE OF NOSTALGIA,"IF YOU ARE A NOSTALGIC FLYERS FAN, THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS BOOK BY STAN FISCHLER MOSTLY COVERS THE PLAYERS ON THE 2 STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIP SEASONS. IT GIVES US A SHORT BUT DETAILED LOOK AT MANY OF THE PLAYERS WHO HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN. TO ENJOY THIS BOOK THOROUGHLY I SUGGEST THIS MORE FOR OLDER FANS SINCE MOST OF THE STORIES AND PLAYERS COVERED ARE FROM THE 1970'S AND 80'S. A VERY NICE BOOK ABOUT THE BROAD STREET BULLIES."
2,Propaganda,"This so-called momentous book is nothing but a mouthpiece for more Flyers propaganda. The employees and fans of this franchise have a maddening (and misplaced) smugness about them, and this tome does nothing to dispell that. Considering that the team hasn't won squat since 1975, the book leads you to believe that the Flyers are the Yankees or Cowboys of hockey. The book does not dwell on the disastrous effect the Bullies had on the sport, inspiring the classic movie ""Slapshot"". It also leaves out the fact that 99 percent of the fans are pie-eyed zombies who would follow Bob Clarke off a cliff if he led them there. Someone needs to do a true expose of this vastly overrated franchise, which has managed to milk 2 lousy Cups for 25 years now."
1,Optecka 650-2600mm,"This lens is an extremely limited lens in that it has a single working fstop, changing magnification is accomplished by pulling the front of the lens out, mechanical connection is unacceptable.It is impossible to produce an image of acceptably sharp quality. I was very disapointed with the results that I achieved, If you are at all serious about your images don't consider this lens - it is a waste of your money."
1,?,"We picked this up in a thrift store. It is from 1984, Australian and absoutely awful! Waste of time. Horrible movie.Story line vague at best."
1,Cobra Crossbow,"The crossbow has plenty of power, but I needed both hands to fire it. The trigger pull is so hard that the weapon cannot be aimed accurately.I ended up throwing it away."
4,bullseye,"This is a very nice package. It is well suited to indoor shooting and will penetrate a typical phone directory to a depth of one inch at a range of @ 12 feet.For a price of fifty dollars you won't be disappointed!The self cocking ratchet is a simple lever designed as the short stock which adds a nice medieval look, and facilitates shooting from the hip."
3,I was premature in my earlier review.,"Yes the ""China"" arrows still suck. I've also discovered that the design of the bow is lacking. The string rubs too hard on the arrow guide. I waxed the string and the guide as advised but I only got about 3 dozen shots before the first string broke. The second string broke 2 strands after the first shot. I don't expect it to last as long as the first string. Between breaking arrows and breaking strings this is very expensive shot per dollar."
2,This book is way too light for this exam,"The methodology of the troubleshooting process is the easy part. This book would have been much better if it had broken down the troubleshooting sections for each layer and given you some concrete ideas about the most common things you might see. Definitely, an extensive treatment of debug output with explanations of what to look for would have been good. Bottom line, read the book so you know the methodology, but get another source because this one won't do it."
1,Look somewhere else,This book is lacking in technical instruction. I depended on this book and failed the test.
5,Excellent coverage on exam topics.,Enough to pass the exam. Go get it and pass the exam.Cisco other CIT book has more detail. I will have that instead of support book as a reference book.Happy Reading
4,Failed the test but because I rushed it.,"Good book on the subject and great for reference at work.Amazon was great though, the shipping was fast and at the door when promised which meant a lot because I was under pressure."
3,"a good book, but not a good book for the test","I bought this book and read it all the way through. It is very well written, and easy to understand. However, this book was written for the Cisco support exam #640-506. Cisco has updated the exams and the new support exam is #640-606. It is my opinion that this is not the best book to prepare for the new 640-606 exam. Cisco Press has another book written for the support exam called ""Cisco Internetwork Troubleshooting"". While this book was also written before the new exam, I believe it will better prepare people for it. I used both books to study for the new exam (which I passed and am now a CCNP), and I believe the questions for the new 640-606 exam were taken from the Cisco Internetwork Troubleshooting book. Could you use the Support Certification Guide book to pass the new exam? Sure, but the test is already hard enough, why make it harder."
1,C I T seems to be the best for the Support Exam,"I'll suggest you for the C I T preperation guide from Cisco Press,by Laura Chappell,Dan Farkas,Thomas Kelly and Daniel Farkas To write technical matter in an understandable way without losing the technical aspects is really appreciatable."
2,Not the book for CIT 642-831,"I Read the book and took the exam. While it may show you trouble shooting methodologies, it does not even come close to preparing you for the CIT exam. The CIT exam requires technical expertise and skills in frame-relay, ISDN and router configurations. This book only explains terminology and the ""show"" command. Bottom line is if your using this book to study for the exam, think again it's not worth the purchase price."
1,Previous reviews are not for THIS book!!,"How can this book get such high reviews (from years 2001 and 2002) when it was published in November 2003? People are saying it is a good book for the 640-60x series exam! Wasn't this book written for the 642-831 exam? If the 642-831 exam covers troubleshooting for frame-relay, ISDN, switching, and routing, then this is NOT the book to buy to prepare for the exam because it doesn't describe how to troubleshoot these technologies!"
4,2 For 2!,"Yet another great item from Classic Sport! We love foosball in our house, but don't have room for the full size so this was a great addition! We play it on the coffee table, on the dining table, or even sitting on the floor!We have the Arcade Hoops from Classic Sports also and are beginning to have the attraction of a real game room! Thanks for keeping my kids active!p.s....the light-up feature on this table is pretty cool..."
1,Does Not Work - A Danger to your cats,"Length:: 1:43 MinsHere I document as a long time cat owner the fact that I have multiple cats and they all refuse to use this product, and that it can be potentially unsafe for your pet, who can be harmed by the sharp corners. I also document that I myself was hurt simply handling the product. I blame this on cheap production of a product that doesn't work for my cats."
1,1 star is giving this too much credit,"I was so excited to get this. Came in the mail and went in the garbage. Unless you have a 1 lb kitten, your cat is going to fall into the tiolet the second they step onto this thing. Too flimsy to even try. Perferations would not hold and cat would not feel safe/stable enough standing on this to try. You'd have better luck making your own with directions from the internet. Save your money."
4,Good Product Overall-Almost Worked!,"So I have three cats, ages 6 months, 2 years and 8 years. I got the 6month old and the 8 year old to enagage in toilet elimination, however, after the 2 year old had her 2nd accident on the carpet, I gave in and let them have the box back. I can not afford to have my place smell like pee and be cleaning carpet all the time. Especially kitty tinkle-it smells pretty potent. Overall, though it is a good product, ingenious design and it did work for two out three, so really that wasn't bad. In fact my baby cat still uses the toilet when given no other choice, like if he accidently gets locked in a room or what not. The only complaint that I had was by no fault of the manufacturer, but it smells awful for the first step and it is a bit messy. There is no avoiding this, that is just part of the process."
2,Great Potential,"I was so excited to find this product. We have 3 cats ranging from 4yrs - 6 months. We spend a small fortune on cat litter and strain our backs each day to clean out the 2 boxes that we have.The product didn't work for us. Our cats wanted to dig ""deeper"" than what the tray would allow. Therefore - they wouldn't use it at all!If only the insert was made about 3 inches deeper - I believe that this product WOULD HAVE worked for us.I was really looking forward to this working!!! Bummer that it didn't."
2,What a mess!,"Didn't work for my cat! Thank goodness we had a separate bathroom we used for the cat. I can't imagine anyone sharing a bathroom while using this product. The rings are shallow and two brands of scoopable, flushable litter stuck in the ridges like cement. Cat poop gets all over the toilet seat. When we started removing the very first section, Kitty Bitty said NO and started pooping on the floor beside the toilet. She even started peeing in the bathtub. Gotta give her credit for keeping it in the bathroom but we are back to the litter box and cat is back in heaven."
2,Wish it would have worked...,"Followed the instructions to a ""T"" but our cat did not take to it. I wish he would've but what can you do. GREAT CONCEPT!!"
3,Many Accidents So Far,"I've been using this product for about three weeks no. It was going okay until one day, my cat refused to poop into it. He was fine. I don't know why he stopped using it. I clean it everyday and make sure all the spaces around the area are also clean. No luck.Going to give it another go, but I'm not holding my breath."
4,It works.,"I would say there is nothing wrong with this product really. It has taken my cat longer than what they suggest, but that's just because she fights change. It is a great alternative to the more expensive version from another company. The only thing I don't like about it is when you start cutting the rings out the lip doesn't hold the kitty litter in the pan. You lose a lot of your litter in the toilet. So, if you're going to do this flush-able litter is a must. But be prepared...it's a little on the expensive side. If you live close to a nice pet store, get the biggest bag of flush-able litter that you can, it's the cheaper way to go."
3,only problem,the material feels a little bit unsecure. if you have a heavy cat and if you think that your cat might be scared I say dont buy.
1,way to messy,This product might be good if you have an extra bathroom. If you are using this product in the same place where you go to the bathroom then it is no good. You will find litter scattered everywhere in your bathroom. I don't recommend using this product. You can make your own seat with a few materials for about the the same price.
3,All depends on the cat!,"I have 2 cats, one grasped the concept immediately, but one just would not do it. You are relying on a variety of factors if this product is to work, two major ones being the intelligence level of your cat, and the willingness of your cat! For me, one of my cats just would NOT use it and it was not worth the battle as she searched for places anywhere except the toilet to go!! However I will say I do not regret at least trying it. Would have been great if both my cats were agreeable to this!!"
1,Kitti Citi Not Good,"At first we were very successful until step 3. Seems my two kitties didn't like this ring gone and there's no way to put it back. In fact it's not easy punching out the rings. Mine cracked,so that's not helping. They now poop on the side of the toilet. So darn close. Going to try Kitty Kwitter, because I know they will catch on eventually, plus you can always go back a step. It seems to be a more sturdy product and i Like that I can reuse it. I found Kitty City's tray to be cheap in weight for the price you pay, $30 was not worth it! PS this is my first bad review I've ever written, so trust me spend the extra and try the other product!"
2,not ideal,"My cat is pretty smart and she understood that the citykitty was her new kittty litter. But she hated it. Shes not picky about the type of litter box she uses but it was too small and shallow for her to cover her poop and after a few days she stopped using it. She peed in it and then pooped right next to the toilet. If you're cat doesnt mind the size and the fact that he cant cover his poop easily, it might work. But it didnt work for us."
1,He would rather pee in the tub...and did so often.,"He used it once then went back to where is litter box was. When it was not there he peed anyway. Also chose the tub as a favorite voiding spot. Great idea, I hope it works for others."
1,too small,the concept is great but i ordered the citikitty and it was sent to me but it is too small for any of my toilets (I have 3 standard size toilets) under the seat and too bit for on top of the toilet seat. I am not happy.
1,Useless - it doesn t work,"It worked at the very beginning, but since I started whith the whole, my cat stopped peeing and finally used any dress in the floor as a litter!"
3,"Good product, but had to give up","This cause our 3 month old kitten so much stress that she developed stress colitis (diahrrea w/ blood). And it was due to the CitiKitty, her fecal came back normal. She only had two accidents in a month and that was when we moved up a step but we couldn't stand seeing her so upset all the time. We gave up after a month and went back to the litter box. The product was fine but this just didn't work for our sensitive kitty's tummy!"
2,Bad quality,"Its not a simple piece to work with. First the perforations aren't easy to cut through. The plastic is hard to support the weight, and because of that it also cracks through easy when cutting to enlarge the hole. You cant go back in hole size at all either. Seems to be a cheap item. Great idea to go with though."
3,hopeful for future use,"we have two cats 6yrs and 2years. they struggled with using the first step on the toilet because the plastic material gives under there weight...I don't think they felt secure. one had an accident on the bathroom floor. we only have one bathroom, so needless to say it was trying for us maneuvering around it and the mess it creates. (lots of litter all over)once we have a place with a second bathroom we are interested in trying again."
4,CVM,"Fantastic product! The insert is sturdy and easy to clean. My two kittens (barn cat rescues) are learning quickly. We have punched out two rings so far and they now know to aim for the hole. If they miss the hole, then they push whatever landed on the tray into the hole/water. It's fantastic! We have moved a little more slowly than suggested, but that is because I want to be sure they are confident before moving to a larger opening. So far so good!! Thanks City Kitty!"
1,not all that great,"I bought the kitty training kit so excited that it would work and I did everything the directions said, but my two cats have never learned to use it. Now they poop and pee all over the floor and I get so upset I want to cry. This is the worse thing ever and it's a waste of money!"
5,My two cats are now flush & go,"I trained my two cats using the Citi Kitty system. It took about 8 weeks, as we went slow and I had to back up with the training a couple times when I could tell I was progressing to fast, but we did it!Most recently I installed an auto flusher on my toilet and now I don't even have to flush for them. No smelly litter box, plus you save money not having to buy litter.I would urge anyone who has a cat on the smaller side (under 10 lbs) to use this system. Cats over 10 lbs might find it to be a bit unstable.Happy toilet training!!"
2,Practical Problems,"I will not comment on whether or not it is possible to teach your cat, with or without a tool, to use the toilet. That is between you and your cat.As regards the Citi Kitty product I have these comments.1. The ""pan"" in only about 2 inches deep so litter gets everywhere. My kitties like to wallow in the litter a little. This was a problem with the 6 inch traditional pan to a lesser extent. Which leads to the second comment.2. Because they like to enjoy the litter a bit, they like the box really clean. I am cleaning it about 3 times a day, which is a small price to pay short-term for a long-term goal. But this pan has concentric ridges all around. Theses are to help you cut out the middle. But it needs to be cleaned more often than it needs to be cut, so I think it was a poor choice.Another time, I would opt for a deeper tray with a smooth bottom."
2,Nice idea but my cats didn't accept it,Nice idea but my cats didn't accept it. I think I would have had to devote days to monitoring my cats to ensure compliance and acceptance. Even my kids didn't require that kind of effort. I switched to flushable litter & it makes cleaning up after cats a bit easier.
3,lightweight but does the job.,"Over price for what you get but does the job. My Maine Coon is a large cat and it used it ok. My Bombay was not to happy, and now I have two Savannahs so I have to start all over again."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,"I followed the directions and my cats would go to the bathroom on the toilet before I took out any of the sections. Then I took out the first section, there were a couple accidents but then none for a week so I took out the 2nd section. That is when it all went to hell, my male cat refused to pee on it with two sections removed and my female cat refused to poo in it, which meant we had accidents all over the house, it was disgusting. So we went back to having only one section gone and the bad behavior continued, the male cat still refused to pee in it and my female cat refused to poo. We tried to train them for 3 more months and could never get them past the 2nd ring without one of them refusing to do one or both bathroom actions on the toilet. And my cats are only 2 years old so its not like they're too old or young to use it. We had to go back to a regular litter box. This is nowhere near as easy as they claim it is and flat out didn't work with our cats."
1,Great for #1 But #2 she found a better place,"I got this for my one cat and used it just as the directions said, my cat took to it immediatly, I was thrilled but after the 2nd week she was still using it but I couldnt not figure why there were no clumps of poo. Well I was later to see that she refused to go poo in the trays, she chose my fire place. I cleaned it out bleached it, the whole nine yards. Finally after 2 months of fighting and cleaning up cat poo all over my house I caved and went to the treditional box. Still to this day I am having issues with her pooing outside her box, but mind you when she was a kitten and up until I got the Citti Kitty she never has an accident before. I highly do not recommend this."
1,Didn't work,I was very encouraged when I was buying this product from all the great reviews but unfortunately it didn't work on my cat.
4,It Takes Time,"I tried out the CitiKitty. Although I think that it would work, you need a lot of time and patience to work with your cat so that they can figure it out. It is really useful to have a second bathroom as well that is just for the cat. I had to give up because I had two cats and one chose to use the bathtub instead of the toilet tray, and the roommates did not enjoy that. I will try again someday when I only have the one cat."
2,it did not work for my cat....,"I think it is depending on your cat, and mine just does not want to poop on the plate with a hole where she can see the water beneath. So that she chose to use my trash can instead....poor me. She always pushed all of the litter on the plate into the toilet. I gave up! It is such a mess."
3,"Wishing this would work, but am losing hope","My cats had zero problem with me moving the litter box into the bathroom, and switching their litter to a flushable kitty litter (I use Feline Pine). However, they have not taken to step one of the CitiKitty system. One problem is that my toilets are not standard and have very wide sides. I had to cut off the sides of the CitiKitty tray to get it to sit in the toilet. I've taped it on to the toilet now, which makes it much more difficult to remove and clean. However, my cats still won't use it. They have taken to peeing on a rug and/or going outside. I'm thinking about getting a deeper aluminum bowl and trying that instead. I don't know if it's the flimsiness (from having to cut off the sides of the tray) or the lack of depth that makes it difficult to bury their stuff. I've been stuck at this stage for a month now and have not gotten my two cats to use the tray consistently. There have been one or two instances but that's all."
1,It almost worked...,"My 6 months old kitten had no problems at all peeing and pooing in the toilet until the very last ring. We stayed on the last stage longer than the other ones (about 2-3 weeks). Then it seemed like he was using it perfectly so I took the kit off completely.About a week later he started pooping on the floor. Usually the carpet right outside the bathroom. If I locked him in the bathroom (when I knew he had to go), he'd poop on the bathroom floor. Even if I sat there with him, he'd start pooping on the floor in front of me. He just has an issue with # 2 and I have no idea what it is. He pees in the toilet 100 % of the time.I'm moving into a new apartment in a couple of weeks and going back to the litter box. I don't want him to poop on the carpet somewhere in the new apartment and then go there all the time. It sucks, cause we were so close... :("
1,CittiKitty Kit,"You're paying for the idea, as the materials in the kit are pretty marginal. The toilet insert is flimsy, and the written material is skimpy. There are better resources on the internet which tell you how to toilet train your cat using readily available and reusable materials."
2,Customer service is horrible!,"I used this product for about a month and a half now and my cats haven't even got to the point of punching out the first ring. I have e-mailed CitiKitty several times for suggestions and their only response was to check the FAQ's, which I told them I had already done with no success. I got no response after this. They want to sell the product but don't want to help or offer suggestions when it's not working. My cats peed in it every time, but usually won't poop in it. I have recently switched to a $5 metal salad bowl from WalMart and it is working much better in just one week!**My advice... save your $30! You can rig up something for much less that will work just as good and probably better. And if it doesn't work for your cats, you will have only wasted $5 instead of $30!"
2,Great idea but too flimsy,"I have a fat cat, and this is not sturdy enough to handle her. Also not sturdy enough to handle a multiple cat household and the extra time it takes, nor the frequent on/off routine in a one bathroom household. I recommend buying a better quality version, the concept works even if this one leaves you aggravated."
2,So far it sucks...,"The commercials look great... easy to do. I first saw it on TV. But it isn't that easy, and its messy. I started working my cat towards the bathroom months ago. He's been using a cat box right next to the toilet for weeks, but remove the cat box and just use the CitiKitty and he won't make the jump. He just goes on the carpet or somewhere else. YUK!!! So now I got him to use his cat box right ON the toilet with the CitiKitty under the cat box. In another few days I'm gonna take the cat box away and see if he'll make the jump to the CitiKitty. If it works I'll be a happy camper... If not I guess I wasted my money... or is there a return for this thing?"
1,did not work at all,"3 cats, hours, days, weeks , months wasted and all my kittens hate it!!I tried everything possible and it did not work! It taught my cats to drink water from the toilet bowl, now I have to be sure that all toilet bowls in the house are closed otherwise the cats want to drink from them."
2,Didn't work for out cats but may work if you have smart cats and start young and are home all the time.,"These didn't work for out cats but may work if you have smart cats and start young and are home all the time. One of my cats was using it but as the other did not, we gave up before we got to stage where the cat went in the toilet without the devise."
2,Didn't work for us,"The product and assembly are easy enough. But that's about the only good thing about this product.My cat absolutely hated it and refused to use it and instead decided to pee in front of the toilet. That said, maybe it was a fear of falling in the toilet because the plastic is so incredibly cheap and flimsy.Back to the litter box we go."
1,very cheap product,"This product is not designed for multiple cats. It is made very cheaply and can not be used in another bathroom. Its didn't work for me at all, I was training two cats on it. If you have more then one bathroom its will cost $30 for each. I didn't realize it would be like a cheap flimsy cut out. Once you cut out the middle there is no going back so if the cat isn't ready for that step then you are out of luck and out of $30. Very poorly made and a very big disappointment. I felt there was not enough info on multiple cat training and the product was badly made."
2,Flimsy,"This potty trainer is not as ""high quality"" as it looks in the pictures. Its thin plastic, unlike other brands out there."
1,Update - DID NOT WORK,So i posted a review about this product a few months ago and now that i'm a few months in i can officialy say this DID NOT WORK. After cleaning cat piss and poo off the ground for 2 months i did not get passed the first ring!!! failed miserably and i didn't even return it since its been used and gross. unhappy customer!
1,not legal in California...,"It is not legal to flush cat droppings in California.Somthing about it killing the sea otters.I wish I had known that before I bought it...And even if you dont care about the sea otters or breaking the law, good luck finding flushable cat litter in California. You would have to have it shipped in.A WARNING WOULD BE NICE!"
1,It's a no go,"Saw this product on Shark Tank and thought it was a great idea. Turned out --- not so much. The process is SO messy that it is not even worth it. If you want to never use your bathroom again, and love cleaning litter off every crevice, then by all means try it out. Also, be warned that sometimes after cats use this they cant actually go back to using a regular litter box and have serious issues with it. I stopped after about four days because I couldnt take it any more. Product is also very difficult to clean etc."
1,Cat is now evil,"If you are not willing to risk your relationship with your cat, this product may not be for you.I know every cat is different. But, we got our cat as a kitten and after 3 years of lovingness from him, we gave the CitiKitty a try. He started using it with the new flushable litter wonderfully. However once the first ring was removed, he hated it and now goes on our carpet. I taped the ring back on, but he still refuses to use it and goes on our carpet. We tried showing him the litter ""yes!"" and the carpet spot ""no."" Yet he only hisses at us now.Right now, our relationship is horrible. He's almost like a stray cat in our home. I hope it goes back to the way things were. Thanks a lot, CitiKitty. You've divided us. Then again, it's different with every cat. So good luck.UPDATE******I put the old litter box back and things are back to normal. I guess my CitiKitty is going on Craigslist now."
1,"Not happy, 7-months latter!","7-months latter and my cat still refuse's to consistently poop in the toilet. I did everything the products says to do, and took my time letting my cat learn to use the toilet. I didn't expect miracles overnight, but I defiantly bought this product with the intention of it working in at least double the time advertised. It is a very messy clean up also. To never buy litter again, I was willing to do what it took to keep it very clean, but its a 30-minute clean up every night trying to sanitize everything and pick up all the litter he paws out of the contraption. He will go a few days straight of pooping in the toilet then most recently all together refuses to poop in the toilet. He will pee in there just fine, but will not poop. Im not at all happy with the product. Too many sleepless nights waking up because of the smell of poop in my bathroom on the FLOOR ! Iv never written a review before, but I felt it necessary."
2,Missing parts,"I got this and opened it and wondered why they would sell this cat toilet seat with no directions and why they would charge what they did for this piece of plasitc. Then, I looked on the back and realized that it was supposed to also come with a little book with directions but mine did not. Luckily I bought a cat training book separately as well."
1,broke in 3 weeks,"It was going great for almost three weeks when I decided my cat was ready to get rid of a ring, after I took it off as soon as he jumped up, he fell in the toilet along with all the litter.....funny watching him jump out but now he's probably terrified of the toilet!"
2,Finally giving up on the City Kitty.,"It makes me sad to have to write this review, but after weeks of 'training' with the City Kitty we are finally throwing in the towel. We bought the CK after seeing it on Shark Tank and had really high hopes for the product. Everything went perfectly through the first few weeks, but when it came down to the last ring our cat wouldn't have it anymore. So, we put in the insert and gave it another try - this time moving up to a larger ring size after 20 days instead of one week. Same story. All is well until we get down to that last ring and, once again, our cat wouldn't have it. So today, sadly, we went back to the old box and threw the CK in the trash. Too bad, because the product idea is great, but ultimately success will depend on your animal and how they decide to cooperate."
1,Poor results,I was very excited when I found this product. I have 5 cats and so any way I can save a bit on cat products I'm excited. First the plastic is very flimsy which I didn't think was worth $15. Had it on my toilet for 3 days and 1 cat used it. However most of the urine went on the floor and under the small liftable tray which was a mess to clean up. I know it's not the product's fault that my kittie sprays all over. I stopped using it because I do NOT want cat urine collecting around the base of my toilet. Great idea just not for my cats. Maybe if there was a wider extension on the sides to account for a kitty who doesn't pee straight down.
2,too flimsy to work,"THE GOOD:It's relatively cheap. Unlike some other designs, it fits most American toilets.THE BAD:It's made out of cheap, thin, flimsy, plastic. When loaded with litter, it bends and warps with every move my cat makes (and he only weighs ~10 lb). It's clear that my cat does not trust the thing to support him, and so a month into the training it's been an uphill battle with many accidents all over the bathroom floor. Also, the bin for the litter is very shallow. It can only be filled with about 1/2 inch layer of litter. This might be ok for later training stages, but initially the cat feels cheated when he's used to digging around in a big litter box. Long story short, this kit is going in the trash and I'm placing an order for a more expensive, solidly-built one."
3,you have to buy flushable kitty litter,You have to buy flushable kitty litter why not bundle it with it so i had to wait because I didn't know u need to buy flushable kitty litter should of put it on the box I am not a mind reader
1,DOES NOT WORK!,I have two cats both less than 5 months old. I bought CitiKitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box. It turned out a piece of flimsy junk that's way over priced. My cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic. Save your money and use it on something more useful.
1,A complete rip off,"This ""kit"" is one extremely flimsy piece of plastic. That is it. Nothing else. It is being returned immediately. Please do not waste your money."
2,needs improvement,"Item good idea but needs deeper toilet pan. cats like to dig & burry aftr their business. The pan is way too shallow. Cat not comfortable & makes huge mess on toilet & floor. Also, people should be advised to start cat on flushable litter in their litter box b4 using kit. Found cat did not like change in litter either. Jury still out but product needs to deepen pan."
3,Not bad,"My cat refused once the litter was gone, however, she was an outdoor kitty with needs to cover the poop. The idea was there, so I think it should work for others. My cat just refused."
1,Waste of Money,"Save yourself the time and frustration and just buy the Litter Kwitter. I know what you are thinking, CitiKitty is half the price of the Litter Kwitter, but there is a very good reason for that.-CitiKitty is made of thin plastic that is not sturdy enough to support my normal 10lb cat without moving around and therefore freaking out the cat who is already scared of the toilet water.-Taking out a ring is difficult, frustrating, and the resulting edges are sharp!-Once you take out a ring there is no going back. If your cat is not ready you are stuck or need to buy a new CitiKitty. At this point it would have cost the same to buy a Litter Kwitter.-The ridges that are designed to keep litter on the pan are very shallow. The result is wasted litter being scratched into the toilet and an empty CitiKitty that your cat won't want to relieve itself on.Don't waste your time or money. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers who didn't like this product either."
1,not happy,"The packaging was damaged, the box was open and crushed, also it was incomplete. In the package states that includes some bonus items, but only the toilet trainer was inside. Not happy with the shipping. Very long delivery time"
2,Failure so far...,"I started out with a cat that was already mostly potty-trained. he had been going in a bowl that dropped into the toilet bowl, but I needed some way to go through the rest of the ""steps"", so I purchased this product. I was originally looking at the Kitty Litter Quitter, but this one was cheaper and seemed to have better reviews.It's been a mixed bag so far. He's urinating in the CitiKitty just fine, but he refuses to poop in it. I think the CitiKitty is too shallow."
3,Didn't work for us,"Our very bright but suspicious two-year-old female cat was unwilling to complete the training with this item. I really believe she had more of an aversion to the flushable wheat cat litter than the toilet training itself. She kept waiting longer and longer before she would use the litter pan (not a good sign). It was, however, the appearance of the first hole in the middle of the contraption that made her completely reject the idea and start using our sofas as litter boxes. The instructions say to replace the missing piece and start over, but that didn't work - she was through.When calculating how much you're going to save on cat litter if this works, take into consideration how much you'll be out if your cat decides against it and ruins your furniture. That being said, I am glad it works for some cats. It's a cool idea. It just depends on the personality of the cat whether it will work or not."
1,Was hopeful but just didn't work out,I was super excited to toilet train my two young cats. I soon found out that it was very difficult and eventually gave up. One of my cats just couldn't get the hang of it. After about 1 month I went back to a litter box.
2,Not good for more than three cats.,"In theory the product would work. It says it works for multiple cats, but I think that they think that multiple cats would be one or two cats. I have six cats and could not get past the second step. If you had one or two cats and could keep them in a small part of your house with the litter box it would possibly work better"
1,Does not work,"Both of my cats used it once because I had removed their litter boxes. After both pissing and defecating in the toilet tray, they never used it again as it was too uncomfortable for them. They pissed and defecated all over the house including the bathtub, sink, closet, and countertops."
2,Not good for feces,I was really excited to train my two cats. I followed the instructions exactly as given in the kit. Both of my cats adapted to urinating in the toilet but when it came to defecating it was another story. I caught both of them scratching the flushable litter onto the floor and creating a pile to go in and then covering it up. Needless to say scrubbing the bathroom several times a day is tiring. I think this is a good concept if you start your cats out when they are kittens. After two days of scrubbing the bathroom floor I went back to the litter box. (:CitiKitty Cat Toilet Training Kit
2,More work than they say,I was very patient with this product. I gave a month per step. Instead of the recommended 2 weeks. I have 2 cats and they caught on to peeing in the kit very quickly. But when it came to pooping they would just do that outside the box. I tried blocking their path or scolding them if they pooped but I couldn't figure out how to get them to feel comfortable pooping on the toliet. I spent 2 months on step 1 and then just decided the constant cleaning of poop off the ground was more work than i wanted.
2,Cloak and dagger,"The product is probably good, but, they DON'T tell you you need to buy ""flushable kitty litter"" which is next to impossible to buy unless you want to buy it from them and they charge an arm and a leg for the product and shipping and handling, nor do they tell you until you get it they expect you to put the cat litter box in your bathroom to get the cat used to it. My apartment bathroom has absolutely no room for anything on the floor like a cat box! Had I known all of these things ahead of time, I would not have bought! As it is, it sits in its box in storage."
3,Okay,"This product in theory is good, it would be best for kittens and not adult cats, my cat is highly intelligent and rejected this product. He used it for 2 weeks although he complained allot, as soon as the first hole went in he pee'd in the shower, that same night he shat in my bed, all bets were off, he had won, he's back to the clever cat box. Again this will probably work good if you have a kitten, also it is to small for an adult cat. I will keep it for my next kitten or if someone i know gets a kitten, but bear in mind it does not work on adult cats."
2,It didn't work,"We tried it with our cat, and it might be because the first hole or two were too big, but he refused to use it. He used it before we cut the hole, but refused to use it after we cut the first hole. On top of that, the hole we cut was only half the size of the first hole they have marked on the plastic and it still didn't work. The plastic itself is very flimsey. This item is completely overpriced as all you get is a sheet of plastic molded to the toilet. It shouldn't cost more than $10, $15 at the most. Not what it is currently priced at."
2,...for me to poop on...,"Honestly, I have two very active (shall we say) kitties and neither one of them like this thing. I' tried the instructions in the manual, then I bought the $7 book from Amazon on how to train your cats, and I tell you, mine just don't like this thing. I don't think it's much to do about the thought of using the toilet (they jump up there enough, but the problem might be in the somewhat flimsy nature of the trainer. even with the lid down for extra stability, my cats just are too wary to step on it, let alone use it...sigh...looks like I'm going back to the littermaid for now, but it's only been four weeks now...maybe they'll come around..."
1,3 Weeks Worth of Upset Cats,"I wanted to like this product. I wanted it to work. But after 3 weeks of very upset cats, who found many other places besides this litter box to poop on, we decided to call it quits.If your cat has ANY fear of water, do NOT buy this. Good test--pick up your cat and hold him over the toilet. Does it freak out? Our cats are super afraid of the toilet, so there was no way they were going to poop in it."
3,"Good for small cat, very hard for older cat","Will try to share pictures and video. I started my 12 year old cat Oct 6 and after three months of mainly cleaning up the (greatest Am litter) in the 2nd stage, just went back to regular litter last week and set it in the shower so it's not trampled through the house. he made his best effort, possibly some pee did go in the toilet on rare occasion; not sure; maybe there was too much going on here with construction replacing carpet to laminate floors, they didn't warn on instructions that I had to switch him midstream to biodegradable litter which was a big set back. I had a really hard time getting any technical support. He was jumping up for pee and poop but eventually started peeing on the rug in front and poop as well and with new laminate floors, just couldn't put up with more accidents. I think this is great idea but for cat's under 5 years of age. Pet Supermarket was great and even credited my card as I had the receipt and box."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was looking forward to the success of this system but after 7 weeks gave up. I have two cats and am around most of the day. I tried everything but one cat would occasionally use the toilet with much encouragement and praise. Most of the time she would do anything to avoid using the toilet. The flower pots, the floor, etc. Even with cayenne pepper in the flower pots she would prefer that over the toilet. The second cat was less resistant but not by much. I cleaned the litter after each use, lavished much praise, gave treats, sprinkled the catnip on the liter, but, nothing worked. As soon as I gave up all was well, no longer cleaning up messes or watching as the cats resisted doing their business."
2,You can't teach my old cat new tricks,"I have two adult cats, and they did not take to this at all. They are accustomed to their covered box with about 3"" of cat litter in it. The instructions tell you to put a thin layer of cat layer in the repository. I did everything the instructions did, but when my cats threw up that first night I did away with the system. They throw up when they don't urinate or poop. I am keeping the system in hopes that when its time to get a kitten I can start when she's young. This might work for you and your cat and it is worth a try to liberate your home from cat litter."
3,Citikitty Cat toilet training kit,Unfortunately this did not work for us. I was really looking forward to getting by without litter cost but my cat wouldn't have anything to do with the flushable litter. She held it for over 24 hours before I finally had to give in. She used the kit when we were in the first stages with the scoopable litter but when the flushable litter started it was NO WAY!
1,Not that great...,"Ok so I bought this product because I saw it on the tv show Shark Tank and thought I would give it a try. Well, it has been over 4 days and I've done everything by the book but my kitty will not have anything to do with the CitiKitty. Instead of going where she should she found a place in the house to relieve herself instead. So, I'm back to the traditional box. I'm hoping to give this another run because for the money that I paid for it I really had high hopes especially after reading all of the great reviews. It looked promising but I'm really disappointed. Maybe it is because it's so flimsy. It's very thin and seems very cheaply made. It really resembles a punch out card template. I will give an update if anything changes but as of now the CitiKitty is a No-No."
1,Doesn't work for 2 cats,"One cat started using the toilet like he should. When I saw the other one drinking out of it I knew this would never work for both of them. If I'm cleaning the litter box for one, I might as well clean it out for both."
2,"no ""sitty"" kitty",It's pretty flimsy for the price. One of my cats took to it just fine while the other completely freaked out. She couldn't stand to sit on it because it was flimsy. We just got her back to where she will use the cat box again instead of the floor. I might try it again some other time and tweak the method a little so she can ease into it better.
4,Great idea,"You're buying into an idea to never use litter anymore, and never have to mess with a stinky litter box. You can only do so much to train your cat, it will either go through the training or refuse to use it. At some point in the training your cat has to use the bathroom in the water; and it is this point whether your cat will take to the toilet training or not.My cat got to the last step before I had to get her declawed. She would no longer use the toilet, so I started the training over again with a new kit. She got to the step where she was suppose to go into the water, and did it one day but would not do it again after that.I can't blame the product for not being successful. There are many cats that go through the training, but unfortunately mine isn't one of them any longer."
1,Horrible,"Once we took out the first insert our cats completely stopped using the CitiKitty! We even tried to add a little more litter to see if that would help, but almost all the litter falls into the toilet. We kept to the first step for 2 weeks as it recommended, before we took out the fist insert. After that, our cat's have pooped on the floor, but what worries us the most is they have not peed in over a day now. We are highly considering going back to litter boxes!!I find this product useless if you have more then one cat....unless you want to buy two of the products and train in two bathrooms!"
2,Bad Kitty,"Didn't work for my 5 year old cat...pure bread american shorthair. He started going in it when there was no holes in it but after the first 2 weeks, when I removed the first ring, he no longer used it and started pooping and peeing everywhere in the basement. I tried putting the other pan in to close the hole cause I thought he might need more time but nope...still wouldn't use it. He was over it. THEN, when I gave up and put the regular litter box back in use, and threw out city kitty alltogether, he wouldn't use it either and pretty soon the house started smelling like cat pee. All of this could be my fault however...I skipped the first step which was to move the litter box into the bathroom first and have the city kitty up and running too. I figured he'd be fine, and he was, but like I said, once that hole was removed, it was over. GOOD LUCK"
2,Did not work!,"I started training my kitten when she was about 5 months old, and gave up about 3 months later. She got to the 2nd ring before her paw fell into the hole and got wet, and then after that she was too traumatized to use it for anything more than urinating. After she began defecating behind the toilet and once right in front of the door, on the door mat, I decided that was enough training. My family trained two other cats using another kitty training kit that wasn't as flimsy as CitiKitty, and that has worked. I will probably buy the other kit and try again with my cat."
4,"Worked for one, not for the other","I used CitiKitty a couple years ago for two cats. One was always fussy when it came to using the restroom anyway, so he didn't take well to being toilet-trained, but I'll never forget the first time I heard my other cat peeing directly into toilet water. It was the only time I'd hear it, though, since both cats soon moved out to my parents' ranch. Now the trainable cat is moving back in with me and I'm excited to toilet-train her again. I know CitiKitty worked once for her (she was trained within one week), but as other reviewers have said, if you cut out a ring, there's no going back, and the edges are very sharp. Otherwise, this method is tried and true. I just might try the cheaper alternative of a metal bowl first."
4,Does its job for its price,"At first look it appeared too thin and unstable, but after using it for few days I realized that it does its job anyway. You might want to tape it to the toilet to insure the stability but it held by toilet cover good enough..."
2,Not great,"I bought this item for two kitten. Kitten 1 got used to it right away for urine, but refused to use it for feces. Kitten 2 climbed in, ate some of the special $30 flush-able litter you have to buy for this item, and never went back. We ended up with a messy bathroom, some urine-stained cushions and fairly unhappy cats.Both cats were 5 months when we started this and 7 months when we gave up."
2,Didn't work for me :(,"I have 2 rescued cats, Tiger, a 1 year old, and Butch, a 3 year old. Tiger used the Citi Kitty and I think he would've gotten trained eventually, however Butch refused. Instead of using the Citi Kitty, Butch would hold in his poop all day and overnight would leave us ""gifts"" in the family room. I tried it for about 3 weeks and it wasn't worth the mess, so I had to give up. My biggest issue with the Citi Kitty is that it is very shallow. My two cats fill up a large litter box overnight. There's no way the Citi Kitty would've been able to hold all their poop overnight."
5,Great service,"While the Calphalon lids are rugged, they can be broken. This lid was purchased to replace one which shattered from thermal shock. Amazon offered the best price and the lid was delivered in 2 days. I couldn't ask for better service."
4,Solid,This lid feels very solid. You can see your food when the lid is used. Only negative is that it's heavy. Besides that I'm satisfied with it.
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL AMERICANS OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS,"There has been much talk of restoring the republic, and following the Constitution. Reading this book is the blue print of our working government. The explanations of what each section means is well written and easy to understand. The reader will be more informed of what it means to be American. S/he will also understand how far we have gone away from the Constitution in today's modern government. Decide for yourself. Read this book."
3,Review,I find a little difficult to understand and it is not as bi-partisan as I expected. It does answer some questions I had regarding the Constitution.
2,bad intro,i did not appreciate the introduction by Caroline Kennedy. had I known she did he intro I would not have bought the book.
1,don't purchase kindle version,the print is too small to read on the kindle and no way to enlarge. very disappointing. do not purchase for kindle
5,The best thing about this RAW,"Finally, some classic Raw matches on a dvd set. The ""Best of Raw"" dvd sets thus far have been pretty good. However, THE best thing about this dvd set is: NO JOHN flippin' CENA. I mean, how great is that?!"
2,is this a doink the FN clown dvd????,"Let me start by saying any time you can get a 3 DVD set with so many matches it's a great buy, but hold on just a minute.... there are far too many Doink the Clown matches !Are u kidding me?Of all the great Raw matches in history,the WWE round table picks Doin the Clown matches to add to this DVD?????And were not talking about 1 or 2 or even 3 matches....there are over 10 damn Doink matches!!!!!!!!!!! Astonishingly Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Really WWE !!!!!,"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS POSTER.10 DOINK THE CLOWN MATCHES REALLY WWE?WHY NOT GIVE HIM A 3 DISK DVD ALL TO HIMSELF LOL ""THE DOINK THE CLOWN STORY SEX DRUGS AND CLOWN MAKEUP""COMING SOON IAM SURE..."
4,Talking Timer,"I use this for flying electric RC airplanes & helicopters. You set the amount of time you want to fly and get an audible warning.The minute count is a little loud and annoying, but can be muted. It is great for Lipo battery life. It was designed to be mounted on a ViewLoader Hopper, so it is a little larger than I would like and oddly shaped, but still is the best I have found for timing flights."
1,FILM QUALITY IS BAD!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I have all these Super Bowls on VHS and when I saw them on DVD, I thought great! But to my disappointment, the film quality is so bad they make the copies I have on VHS look great! I wouldn't of paid 1 dollar for this load of crap, had I know the quality would be so bad. NFL films should be ashamed for putting out something so poor!!!"
2,S.F. v. Dallas 1981 Championship Game Missing?,"I am not a fan of the Forty-Niners. I am a Dallas fan. Being an objective Dallas fan, I have to saythe Forty-Niners are our great historic rival for championships. Dallas won 4 in the '70s and '90s,and S.F. won 1 in the '90s and then there was the 1981 Championship game: won by the 49ers- the greatestgame they ever won. How on earth can that game be missing in this DVD collection? Who thought of that? The greatVin Scully called the game for CBS another reason that game is a treasure to own for 49er fans.As much as I hate the 49ers, I like the fact we have a rival that brings it when it counts. That's what makescompetition fun....The game I will always remember? How 'bout them Cowboys!"
3,"""Not So"" Super 49er's","This is a great DVD set, with the exception of the first half audio for Super Bowl XIX all of them are very good quality. However this is the team of the 80's and all you have is the Super Bowls. Yes the first three were great, XXIV & XXIX not so much (no competition), but what about some of the other great games this team has had. I know other people have put their input in on other games so I won't do the same, but please either make a second volume or rerelease it with some more games"
3,Great Super Bowls but only 1 qualifies as a Greatest Game,"I loved seeing these Super Bowls, but there were so many games that should be here. If Dallas and the Giants have games beyond the Super Bowl why not the Niners? The Catch Game against Dallas, Catch 2 against the Packers, 2002 Wild Card game against the Giants, 1994 NFC Championship Game, Young's last second run against the Vikings, Montana destroys the Eagles in 1989. 1988 & 1989 championship games. All those should have been there too. Hopefully they will come out with a second volume"
3,missing some stuff,"Why do teams like the Giants, Eagles and Cowboys have bigger sets. Where is the 1981 NFC Championship? 1994 NFC Championship? 1998 wildcard win vs Green Bay?I mean it's not a bad set, but I think teams like the Steelers, Raiders, 49ers and Redskins got snubbed just because they won alot of SB's. They have way better histories than the Eagles. And they had alot of other great games outside of the Super Bowls."
3,"Good, but incomplete","Good to have the full super bowls together, but this set is shortchanged by not having other key playoff games included, like some of the other team sets. If they ever do a version 2, my choices for additional games would be:1) 1981 NFC Championship game vs Dallas (actually played Jan 82)2) 1994 NFC Championship game vs Dallas (Jan 95)3) 1994 regular season win vs Dallas4) 1988 NFC Championship game vs Chicago (Jan 89)5) 1998 Playoff win vs Packers (TO TD on final play)"
1,Beware! This disc is a rip-off!!,These are NOT the original Paper Lace recordings. This is an extremely cheesy compilation of re-recorded versions of songs that were on the two Paper Lace LPs. It really stinks and I recommend that you stay away from this rip-off!
1,Don't Buy,"This product is not what I expected, Paperlace had better quality music. It seemed that these were not the original band members or the original songs. I found only 3 songs that I remembered and the sound quality was not that great."
2,yawn,"I gave Is Kissing a Girl Who Smokes Like Licking an Ash Tray two stars because is like so many romance stories of its kind, boring and fluffy and it is highly predictable. It is a very basic because like I said it is like every other love story i.e. nerdy guy meets wild girl, he isn't sure he likes this girl because she is so wild, he spends some time with her and learns that she is actually a smart girl and not as wild as he thought. He likes her, and then like turns to love, then in the end he kisses her. A very simple pimple and blah and bland book."
3,"Good series, poor packaging","This series is very fun and reccomended for any anime fan. The english dub is also done well fo those who dont like subtitles. The main problem with this release is the packaging. All the DVD's are mounted on a single spindle so you must remove the upper DVDs to get to the DVD you want to watch. Also the slip in jacket that goes on the outside of the case was cut too large so that it formed a large crease through it when it was inserted into the DVD case.If you dont already own the Genshiken series I would still reccomend to buy this release because of the great price. If you already have part of the series, I would reccomend to try and purchase the missing pieces seperately."
3,Not really worth my time.,"Genshiken is a story about a college anime and manga club. It's just a slice of life anime about mega Otaku. The production quality of this series is pretty good, but the story is just kinda boring. I'm an Otaku, so you would think this anime would be right up my alley. However, there's just not enough substance to it. The only reason I didn't give it 2 stars is b/c it made me laugh a few times. Definitely try to watch some of it on you-tube or something before you spend money on it."
4,Decent collection but not put together well,"This is the complete collection of the entire series and the DVD quality (playability, menu, languages, episode selection, etc.) is decent. I'm not a fan, however, of how its put together. They're not kidding when they say the DVDs are stacked into one big pile together. This is the first time I've seen a series of DVDs stacked together this way in one case.....very annoying. Aside from the stacking, its pretty good at a decent price."
4,good ink! two pack,matched the printer as listed on the box/site and worked fine. could be a lot cheaper though - but as always amazon deal beats all.
1,Leaking Ink,"Two weeks after receiving the ink, I opened the sealed package it came in and found a small pool of ink. I cleaned up the cartridge and put it in the printer and it is working,"
2,Took way to long to receive it 19 days,"I will not order my ink this way again from Amazon called and got replacment very nice about sending another one 1 day delivery, then first one shows up. Now I have to Pay to return it. Bad experience! The product seems to be fine."
3,Evaluation Models (J-B PE Single Issue,"The issue has only comentary about the work the professor Stufflebean, it no has nothing new about. I, expected some avance on evaluation theme.thanks by your interes about my opinion.Dr. Octavio Castillo MD, FICS."
3,A little thin,"While I found these to be thinner than I expected, they have not torn under my conditions of use. I wanted brown, and these are nice in having green on one side and brown on the other. I bought numerous sizes, good to have around."
2,Not that great,"This tarp is cheap and pretty much a one use item. I bought it to cover some stuff in my truck bed while I drove from Seattle to Minneapolis, it lasted half a one way trip and I ended up buying a much more durable tarp about half way through the drive. The wind just shredded this thing."
5,"Perhaps the best book on Lincoln, ever","Bennett does and excellent job of unmasking the real Lincoln - a racist, power hungry, hate monger.Well written, well researched and backed up with facts."
4,Think About It,"I found the book very good. A Art Hunter missed the whole point of the book. He says Black Americans are living better than any in the whole world. This is true NOW, back when Lincoln were living Black Americans were at the bottom of the world's totem pole being enslaved. This enslavement brought along rapes and murders. If Africans were never forced here than the present America wouldn't have received the benefits of slaves or people whose ancestors were slaves. These benefits include Washington D.C and the traffic light. Washington D.C design was from a black man and so was the invention of the traffic light. Yes Black Americans are living good but whose to say those inventions wouldn't have helped advance Africa rather than America."
2,A Book that does not look at historical context,"When we look at historical figures we often put them on today's pedistal. Lincoln could easily be called a racist in today's sense of the word. In the 1800's sense he was far from a racist- he was a ""black lover"" according to many. I respect Bennett's conclusions but he is wrong. Lincoln had no white dream- he wanted blacks free but did not think they were the equal of the white man. This view was held by nearly all the abolitionists of the 1800's. Today we could easily call 9 in 10 of them racist. TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL CONTEXT. The idea of revisionist gets a bad rap because of its horrific failure in this area. DO NOT READ REVISIONIST HISTORY- it is meant only to destroy historical figures. I enjoyed what I read of the book but was angered by the conclusions. I did not finish it because I thought it was not worth it. If you enjoy revisionist history it is a great read."
1,Grinding a Politcal Axe,"This book is...an insult to the intelligence of all those former slaves who were wise enough to judge Lincoln by the actual results he brougth rather than measuring him against some perfect set of ideals that had no relation to political reality.True, Frederick Douglas has his doubts about Lincoln right up until the end. But in the end he appreciated the role Lincoln had played as an emancipator and judged his efforts to be ""sublime"".Lincon's gift lay in his capacity to grow. In the final analysis he achieved greatness whatever the flaws he may have started with. Douglass recognized this and Lincoln in turn cane to recognize the greatness of Douglas and of all the former slaves who stood and contributed to the creation of a more just society.Lincoln and the slaves overcame their limitations together. They each worked in their own ways to achieve a more just society. It is a shame the author of this work refused to recognize this obvious truth."
3,In the middle,"I feel that this book is miss based. hile I understand Bennett is fighting the emancipator myth of Lincoln, I do not believe that that part of Lincoln, or the lack there of, was his defining characteristic. Lincoln himself said that his main cause was to save the union, and without the union, what good would have emancipation been? The book opens new avenues of thought and should be read even though the referencing of this book is truely aweful. I found myself severly doubting many of Bennett's quotes becasue of the way he breaks them up and inserts his own words. While acceptable once in a while, it is not acceptable on every page. This book will make you a better read person, but take everything with an extra grain of salt, and beware the Lincoln bashing."
1,revisionist stuff,"did this guy vote for mcclellan? the book is nothing but axe grinding. ok, lincoln wasn't perfect. but if he had lost the election to either douglas or mcclellan things would have been a lot worse. the man was trying to save a country from being torn apart at the seams. the author cites a wide range of ""historical evidence"". he forgets that when you quote sources its usually smart to leave them in context. i may be no scholar on the president, but i have read a lot about him. lincoln was a man of his times, as we are men of our times. a lot of revisionist historians employ the tactic of deleting this fact. the book is nothing but copperhead propoganda in an election year. far superior works are out there. the author will make friends among the liberal ""culture police"" that have been on patrol for the last eight years. for a better book on the sixteenth president read mr. oates work ""with malice towards none."" it is far more balanced and correctly researched."
1,The Death of Critical Thought in America,"I have read the previous positive reviews of this book but still cannot believe what I have seen. In the end, actions speak louder than words. Whatever some author may want to speculate about Lincoln, his actions are part of historical fact. He did author the proclaimation of emancipation, he did commit to a war against states that practiced slavery, and he did set the slaves free. No misinformed book, no matter how popularly reconstructionist it is, can change this, and at the end of the day Lincoln's actions are what mattered. Read this book with a critical, questioning eye and demand more of the author than just sensationalism."
1,what nonsense,"Lincoln was a racist. What a shock. Try to find five white Americans in the mid-1800s who weren't, at least according to today's overused meaning of the term. Civil rights activists toss around the word 'racist' like white supremacists toss the n-word, as a slur that shuts down all conversation, and that nothing else the person says or does can remotely be considered positive. Bennett has one good point in that by holding Lincoln as the emancipator we perpetuate a great man image of history and overlook the work of thousands of blacks (and whites) who forced an end to slavery. Beyond that, this is a piece of historical garbage, lacking in context, misreading of quotes, full of anachronisms. The fact that traditional historians have done the same by presenting a lily-white version of our past does not excuse it. Shame on you, Mr. Bennett."
1,Stuff and Nonsense,"""Forced into Glory"" is reverse racist nonsense.Bennett doesn't even try to look into the extremely valid reasons why Abraham Lincoln couldn't or wouldn't go straight for Emancipation the moment he stepped foot in the White House.Oh yeah, President Lincoln might have cracked a ""racist"" joke,so Lerone says the man is a racist no matter how many times he expressed horror as a young man when seeing a Slave Market, or interceding on behalf of Black Americans,or pushing the Emancipation policies when the time was right, or opening the doors of the White House to Frederick Douglass.I just wonder how many times Lerone Bennett has cracked a racist joke or made derogatory remarks about White folks???This book is an insult to memory of Abraham Lincoln, and not very historically valid. Not worth a star."
4,I'm glad I read this book,"Abraham Lincoln was definitely a man influenced from the times he lived in. Why does that surprise anyone? I've been reading a lot of negative things about this book, and I find it very interesting that those critics choose to ignore the documentation that Bennett includes in Forced into Glory. The documentation is actually there and anyone can check it out for themselves. Given to us by Lincoln himself and the diaries of some of his cabinet members. It was common knowledge during that time that Lincoln held racists views. Yet all you hear are screams of inaccurate revisionist history. For crying out loud, even when you bring them the evidence they're still in denial. Lincoln was simply not the great emancipator that history has made him out to be. Get over it!"
4,"A necessary read for the truth about the tyrant, Lincoln","While the authors conclusions about reparations for slavery are wrong, his depiction of Lincoln as racist tyrant are very accurate. A more fulsome book on Lincoln; statist politician, deadly tyrant, and scource of freedom see ""The Real Lincoln : A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an Unnecessary War"" by Thomas DiLorenzo.Both are must reads for every American."
1,Give me a break,"Wow, another black man with a chip on his shoulder. One does wish that he were better versed in historical context and brought an open mind to his pen rather than a pre-conceived notion meant to shock. It is clear he intends to perpetuate the ho-hum, way-too-old ""I'm a victim"" stance, wherever and however he can. People scholarly enough to create trash that others buy into to could better use their scholarship to promote healthy, forward-looking thoughts and spirits instead of negative ones."
1,True Rubbish,"This book is a disgrace,id like to give it -10 trashing one of the greatest presidents our Country has ever known. There are many reasons Lincoln could not go straight for Emancipation, reasons he could not come out and say the war was about freeing people. What a disgrace to Ab's memory and hopefully the majority of people don't by this rubbish. The author clearly has a grudge, people need to let slavery go its in the past, it was a bad past but it's the Past. There are far more books telling of Lincoln's disgust of slavery and how he felt when he saw slaves etc. Just because the man made a racist joke, dosent make him racist. Just look at all the racist jokes comedians make today, does that make them racist just because they are wanting to get a laugh, I think not."
2,This version is made in China,"Not that it is a piece of junk, but it isn't the SOG that people are expecting. I held one today, and for $40+ it is ok, but to make people think that this is a $100+ knife marked down to $40-ish without saying why (because it is now made in China) is deceiving."
4,Sog SEAL PUP ELITE,"This is an adequate field knife. The AUS 8 steel is fairly easy to sharpen, holds an edge well enough. A higher carbon steel would be better but you trade that quality for the corrosion resistance of stainless steel. It is light weight and well balanced. It is the right size for doing alot of finer utility work where a larger knife would become awkward, however I find it too small for heavy chopping and splitting wood. This is not a problem for me as I always keep a small machete in my bugout bag. Overall as a field knife I would say that it is more than adequate and due to it's construction should last a long time, and be capable of any task that you would need from a "" FIELD KNIFE"", when partnered with a good machete or hatchet. If you want a do it all ""SURVIVAL KNIFE"" then I would recommend a larger heavier bladed knife."
5,Great knife!,"This is a great improvement over the regular Seal Pup, a thicker blade and longer knife edge. The price is also a knockout!"
5,Perfect Knife!,I have to say this knife took my breath away. What a weapon/tool this baby is. SHARP as a razor!
5,Sog Seal Pup Elite,"I personally think that this is one of the best products I have ever ordered online or any where for that matter! The Sog Seal Pup Elite knife is great! I noticed right out of the box it was razor sharp with clean lines and appearance with alot of improved features over the older Seal Pup. Dont be fooled tho just because it's made in Taiwan it dosnt mean the quality has diminished one bit if anything it has improved greatly. The steel and the quality are grade A and for the price, you simply cant beat it any where. I would more than highly recommend this product to anyone that is a Soldier, an Outdoorsman, Bushcrafter,Fisherman, Professional etc.This is the knife that you need to be a dependable friend in what ever situation you might find yourself in and know it wont let you down!"
4,Go Johnny Go,The stupid plot had me laughing. The music was worth the price. It brought back memories of my teen years.Go Johnny Go [VHS]
3,"A ""fair and balanced"" treatment that can cure insomnia","I've read several Enron books, from Cruver's poor product to Lynn Brewer's silly treatise, and I have to say that this one is probably more accurate and balanced than any of the others, but..... it's a real snorefest. Any author that can take a fascinating story like this and put a reader to sleep with it is not really overachieving in my view.I guess Fox couldn't get anyone significant to talk to him and maybe that held him back some, but it didn't keep Cruver and Brewer and Swartz from producing more entertaining stuff in their efforts which were similarly unencumbered by input from people who were really making it happen. Oh well, he produced a ""fair and balanced"" treatment that just might help you with that insomnia thing."
5,The Nuclear Solution,"In the year 2047, earth has been ravaged by a limited nuclear war and is now divided between Pan America and the Sino Soviet power bloc.But in space there is a tyrant with the power to overcome both or shift the balance of power in either direction. On earth there is an ancient anit-war leader with psi vision of a planet linked to ours.But full scale nuclear war could destroy both before the path to human salvation is found.A thought provoking book that looks at human politics and human folly that could be our future."
5,This A great book about more than just coaching baseball.,"Lopez does an excellent job of explaining the complexities involved with coaching high-level baseball, that alone makes his book a success. What makes this book stand out is that he goes beyond coaching baseball, to coaching life. He talks about attitudes and ideas that will carry over from the field to the ""real world"" and that is what many high level coaching books leave out. The baseball instruction in this book is second to none. A must have for any serious coach."
5,A Good Blend...,"This book is a useful tool for all interested in working with children and families. It is a good mix of technicality and simplicity; incorporating practical, research and theories as relates to therapy with children. It is easy to comprehend by both the professional and lay person alike. I have found it very useful as a student and cannot recommend it highly enough."
3,"Number 3 is okay, but....","I've played this one a couple of times, and I personally don't feel it is up to par with volumes one and two. For me, the cd didn't hit its stride until I got to #6 Distant Plateau and #7 Awakening. I wished the cd was more on the plain of the superb mixing of these two songs, but I'm a bit disappointed. Other people may disagree with me and that's okay. It's my opinion."
1,Best to avoid this album,"This is a poor album with very few highlights. The mixing itself is good, however the track selection is awful - literally nothing worth putting the album on for a second listen and even remixes of decent tunes like 'Fade' are poor.Its not in the same league as Volumes 1 and 2. Don't buy this album on the reputation of its predecessors."
5,great cd,"a great cd about peace . it's good to see a bunch of artist come together and record these songs . My favorite song on this cd is ""knockin on heaven's door"" , by avril lavigne . I highly reccomend this cd for anyone"
4,This a CD worth buying but...,"Avril Lavigne singing ""Knockin' on Heavens Door"" was Great and so was many of the other songs. But some of the songs were kinda boring and have no meaning too. Well that's all."
1,Horrible,"I had a Hard Time Keeping Myself awake while listening to this CD, not only do all the songs sound the same, but there aren't any upbeat ones on it at all, its a shame i wasted $26.99, on this crap, i recommend you don't buy it, unless your an insomniac and need something to help you to fall asleep"
2,Didn't work for my flan,"I was disappointed with this pan. It is too small to accommodate my cuban flan recipe. The indentation around the perimeter caused the flan to cook unevenly, and it drooped in the middle. The quality is good, so I will use it for other recipes."
3,Flan Pan,"I recently bought this flan pan from Amazon because I was having no luck finding it in stores. Seemed a little pricey, but I still bought it having no other choice of where to buy it. After receiving it, I did find flan pans in a couple stores, for 1/3 of the price!! So, I returned the one I bought from Amazon, and bought one in a local store. Shocking that the new one I got was still less than the Amazon one even after having to pay for two shipping charges (the original shipment to me, and then my shipping charge to return to them. Makes me think, what else am I spending too much for on Amazon?!?!"
5,WOW!,"This was truly one of the best books I have ever read. At times I couldn't put the book down! I even went so far as to laugh out loud from time to time. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who has struggled to ""keep it real."" MUST READ TO BELIEVE!!"
5,"Real for me, real for anyone","This was a good read. I purchased a copy for my sister-n-law and once I read it I was glad to know that it was a great gift to give. The book was easy to read and kept my interest peaked as that is sometimes difficult due to my schedule. The fact that there were things that I learned as well as things I was familiar with made it seem ""real for me"" for sure!A great ending to a great story. This author has great potential and I look forward to reading more from him."
5,He kept it Real!!!!,"For the record I this is my first book reading in 20 years plus.Reading a book was one of my New Years Resolutions.I start reading this book early in the day and finish it late that night.I didn't want to put it down!!The characters were easy to connect too.As I was reading I became a part of the book.The book made me feel like I was watching a movie that kept it real.Eric,maybe Denzel or Spike should give you a call about putting ""Real for Me"" on the big screen."
1,A lame self-help book .. no relation to Marley and Me,"This book is just a lame, and very christian book of anecdotes by a Tennessean who hopes to do lectures and sell books.It has absolutely nothing to do with John Grogan (the columnists) absolutely brilliant book, Marley and Me ...I really wish Amazon would not relate the two books ...I am planning to return this tomorrow ...This book is going to be returned tomorrow .. I found it awful and in many places distasteful.Read Marley and Me and not the other work by this other John Grogan.Thank you."
1,"Is this the author of"" Marley and me""?!?","I am really confused this book or booklet was like a bad version of a Guidepost. It wasn't all that witty and the tales weren't that good. I bought this book figuring--It would charming and funny like the book ""Marley and me"".It was lame, dull, religious and preachy.I feel like I should charge Amazon a fee for wasting my time money and energies! What a RIP OFF! Below 1 star if that is viable!"
1,Help I've Fallen & Need a Good Laugh,Not worth the paper it's printed on. I was very disappointed in this book and for what I paid for it was a terrible waste of time.
5,Good book - Ignore the one star reviews!,This is a great book...funny and light-hearted. It does not deserve the one star ratings from people who thought it was written by another author of the same name.Definitely worth it....
3,It is worth the price,"As is typical with long lists of just about anything, many of the 365 suggested activities are not overly creative or new. However, I did find several that are interesting and doable. Even a few great ideas makes the book worth the price!"
4,I recomend to buy this book,"If you are a e-teaching or you are in the e-learning business, you must buy and read this book. This book explain the e-teaching work, how to moderate a online class without lose the control, how to train and monitoring a e-moderator,... talk about the important things in the success of the work of a e-teacher/e-moderator. I found this book very informative, I recomend it!."
4,Super cool looking watch!,"This watch just arrived and I already love it. The face is thicker than my previous watch, so I hope I won't hit it on anything. I like the low-profile watches so that I can wear it all the time with the least discomfort and fewer scratches and scrapes.The photo shows the numbers in red, WRONG! The numbers are black but the light illuminates them in pinkish-purple.The buckle on the band seems cheap but the watch wasn't expensive so I predicted that. Overall, I am excited to have it.. It makes me feel like a rockstar or a rapper!"
1,No nectar for birds,"I was very excited about getting feeders that would feed our large number of birds. I ordered two of these 48 oz feeders. They both leaked out their contents drip by drip. I tried jiggling to get the air out, twisting to make sure they were tight - all to no avail. If there's a secret to getting them to work right, I never discovered it."
5,Great Feeder,"My husband, the hummingbirds and I were thrilled with the feeder. It is easy to fill and I love the six perches. We have been feeding hummingbirds for twelve years and I was filling feeders every day. Now I will get to wait for a couple of days.I thought the feeder was great."
2,A nightmare to reassemble,"Like the wide mouth--easy to fill, but a nightmare to reassemble. The clear plastic bottle doesn't fit properly into the opening. It takes me several minutes of struggling (and splashing) to get it together.on the plus side, the hummingbirds definitely like this feeder, and they drain it pretty darn quickly. During the summer, between this feeder and my other (a Best-1), I use over 1/2 gallon a week--1 c sugar for every 4 c simmering water.I'm getting rid of this one and getting another Best-1, even though I have to use a funnel to fill the Best-1."
1,Cheap and Disappointing,"I've owned several Perky Pet feeders over the years, wish I'd read all of the poor reviews before purchasing 2 of these to replace my old ones! First of all the container for the nectar is plastic, not glass like my previous feeders. When I went to assemble it, the perches and ""flowers"" are so cheap and poorly constructed they kept popping off! Disappointed for sure! :("
1,Disappointed and ripped off!,"After a week's use they became ""warped"" for lack of a better termand did not fit easily together. I exhausted my patience which I honestly have alot of,not to mention that one arrived with a crack located at the bottom of the cylinder. I threw them both away because it would be a pain to send them back. I will stick with the 30 oz. glass feeders as they do not warp and last forever even though the capacity is less. They are probably healthier as they are not plastic reservoirs."
1,Perky Pet 220 is a leaker,"This feeder is a leaker. I have owned 5 of them and 4 leaked. Perky Pet did, however, replace two of them - with two more that leaked as well. They all leak where the flower attaches to the base."
1,Does not last long!!,Good luck getting the base attached after the 1st time you use it. We have a lot of Hummingbirds on our property and the 48 ounce was the way to go except that after the 1st time you use it the plastic tank and base got warped and we ended up cracking the plastic tank. Ordered the glass 40 ounce model instead. We hope it works better.
2,Manufacturing defects in hummingbirds feeders,"I have used hummingbirds feeders for over 10 years. This time I ordered two hummingbirds feeders Perky-Pet Master 48 ounces and both had problems with leaks in the bottom part of feeder. It seems that the plastic seal which joins the two parts of the bottom had defects, in both feeders.As it is very difficult to return them, I had to repair them with epoxy glue."
2,Feeder Leaker,"The 48-ounce ""Grand Master"" feeder developed a leak around the periphery of the base within a few days. We had a larger version for years, but they no longer make it. This was the largest one we could find, but we are disappointed in the leaking. Unusable."
2,Leaky hummingbird feeder,"Received as promised, set it up and it leaked from the bottom. I found the pin-hole sized leak and applied epoxy sealant. Had it up for a few days now and it seems to work without leaking."
1,Leaky piece of trash,"This item leaks from the top when upside down so you have to turn it upright before going outside. Then ever so slight of a wiggle causes the liquid to drip from the flower holes.WORST DESIGN I HAVE EVER SEEN IN HUMMINGBIRD FEEDERS.Go to walmart they have a nice feeder for $10, this feeder should not be sold."
3,Good sturdy feeder,"This is a well made feeder. Easy to clean, but after filling it with sugar and water (no food coloring because I feel it isn't good for the hummers, they don't come to it. I have other feeders that are colored red on the cylinder and the birds love them."
2,Unsatisfied,The birdfeeder arrived brocken and barely usable. You would think the company would Q.A. these items before sending them to customers even if it is used. They are probably hoping I will not react to such a low priced item. They are right as it is too much of a hassle.
2,very disappointed,"We live in southeastern Arizona & keep 10 feeders going that we have to fill every other day. I purchased 4 of these 48 oz. feeders & even though the canister is easily cleaned, the reservoir takes an engineer to getit back on. They came with NO instructions & the first time we filled them, 2 of them broke at the base, they are so flimsy. We do like the fact that they are made in the USA, but the frustration isn't worth it when cleaning/refilling them. Perky Pets need to go back to the drawing board on these feeders. They just aren't worth what you have to pay for them."
2,Leaking bird feeder. I'am upset I don't know how to contact anyone.,I just bought the hummingbird feeder in June. Was so happy! Now it's leaking at a formed seam. Amazon makes it hard to contact anyone with a problem. All I want is to have it replaced.
3,Leaks Liquids,"Perky-Pet 220 The Grand Master 48-Ounce Hummingbird FeederThis feeder was bought because it was so big and could save us time filling so much during the day. As long as the birds are feeding, there is no problem, but once they go to bed or the feeder is brought inside, it leaks its contents all over the counter top or onto the ground. I give it one star for quick delivery, one star for ease of cleaning and one star for holding a lot."
5,"Great Product, really like the ease of refilling.","We have lots of humming birds. Refilling feeders daily. This feeder has a large bottle with a wide open top, where most feeders have a bottle neck that makes it hard to clean and fill. The bowl at the bottom is also easy to clean. The plastic is a little flimsy. However it is inexpensive enough to replace often. We love it and are going to order more."
2,They leak,"I purchased two of these to avoid filling everyday...I have a bunch of activity each summer. The problem is..... these feeders leak sugar water all over my patio. During hot weather the amount can be significant, up to a 1/4 of the capacity. Very messy"
2,hard to handle,The top is hard to put back on after filling and you have to wait for it to be tottaly empty to refill or you get the food all over.
2,Problems,"It is hard to get the feeder part on to the plastic feed holder. Makes a big mess with sugar water all over me, floor and sink drainboard. I had this feeder in the past and liked it, however, the last two I purchased I rarely use now."
5,great feeder,"This is a large hummingbird feeder that doesn't have a small neck on the bottle, so it is very easy to clean. I have 4 of these around my home for the summer hummingbirds."
1,A Case Study in Poor Design,"This feeder could have been the best ever. But product engineers at Perky Pets obviously have no clue about hummingbirds, or at least don't care. The capacity is fantastic, filling is simple, but the base is a haven for nastiness. There are so many nooks and crannies that are impossible to clean, that they just fester with bacteria after a few days. To design a base that is easy to clean surely isn't rocket science, and if you are as big as Perky Pets, one would think they would have animal welfare in mind. Let alone customer convenience. Apparently not, and I for one, refuse to purchase any more of their products."
1,FIRST DISPOINTMENT WITH PERKY-PET PRODUCTS,I have bought perky pet glass feeders for many years always felt they were the best. BUT because this size uses plastic tubes they do not fit well and are hard to put together plus of the 3 I bought 2 leak out. Should have sent them back but did not find out the problem until to late for a refund.
5,The BEST hummingbird feeder!,"This style of feeder is the easiest to clean, fill, clean, enjoy, and....did I mention CLEAN?? Through the years, I have tried nearly every style of hummingbird feeder, and though some may be more attractive, if you have several feeders to maintain, convenience is important! Plop these into hot soapy water. You can get your sponge inside the whole feeder, and within all of 60 seconds, it is clean, rinsed and ready to fill. (Tip: despite warnings, you CAN use a little bleach with hot water to clean the black mildew around the feeder ports. Just rinse well and allow to air dry.) For those of you who think this feeder is too large for your needs......you don't have to completely fill it! But with the six feeding ports, you will probably find that this feeder attracts many more hummers. Get one and enjoy!!"
1,NOT MY FAVORITE FEEDER,"For a feeder to be this size, it needs to be more sturdily constructed. Perky Pet has some fine products. This is not one of them. The container is easy to clean, but it's made of plastic that does not hold up over time. The ""connectors"" which hold the resovoir to the base become brittle and crack, or break off, rendering the product useless. The little feeder perches are a real joke. They broke off before one season was over. What is the point of the larger container? Despite its size, there are still only 6 feeder ports. For just a little more than price of this one feeder, you can purchase 2 30-oz feeders, double the number of ports, and increase the liquid offering by about 20%.I do not recommend this feeder. However the Perky Pet's 30-oz glass feeder is a very good product."
1,48-ounce feeder,"I have been feeding hummingbirds for 34 years. I use Perky-Pets # 209 and # 210-P. I have never had one leak. I have about 50 feeders up now. I had an increase of hummers and needed larger feeders. I ordered 6 220's. Since I have never had one leak I disposed of all package and packing material. The next day I loaded 6 feeders and 3 leaked. I crazy glued them, put them back up and then the other sides (underneath) started to leak. I would have returned them but I needed them for at once use. I have had them for 8 days now and another has started to leak. I can not send them back as they have glue all over the bottom. I understand how one could leak, but not this many. All of them are leaking in the same 5 slots on the bottom."
1,Very Bad,"I wouldn't really call this book gothic, as it is not scary in any way. Set in New York in 1864, it concerns a 22 year old woman whose father has died, leaving a bad reputation. She tries to repair it, with no success. The dialogue is extremely tiresome, the heroine has zero sense of humor and bends over backward to please an annoying little brat who persists in calling her a witch. By the end of the book a man with narrow eyes and no discernible eye brows is suddenly the possessor of a ""handsome face.""And that the young lady was able to purchase five ready made dresses (with hoopskirts)at the General Store, in her size, and the mention that the house had closets with ample space, doesn't seem at all likely in 1864."
5,This guy is my muse!,"I read Harrod's first book after seeing some art cars at The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. After that, the seeds were planted! In a few months I had made my first art car. I finally got to meet Harrod and get a copy of Art Cars when he appeared with several of us exhibiting our creations at Artscape. It was fun to ooh and aah over pictures of many other art car folks in this book who have become good friends of mine in the past few years. Art Cars will inspire you to go out RIGHT NOW and start decorating your vehicle!"
5,"Art Cars: The Cars, the Artists, the Obsession, the Craft","All that have seen my copy have loved it. Hardly anyone could view this book and not smile. Too bad it's now gone out of print, but there are other wonderful books and a brand new movie by Harrod Blank."
2,Hole in the seam,"It is probably random, but this little guy came with a hole in his seam. Wish I had time to sew him up. He was cute though."
3,A different take on Vietnam veterans.,"I really liked this book. It is true, as one reviewer stated, that it is not a novel, per se. It is a series of character portraits that hang together based on similar situations. One of the things I do love about this book is the title. To me, it is two-fold: it is what we, the veteran, do to make it home from the war and it is also what we, the wife, child, parent, friend do to make ""home"" home again. The dialogue is very believable in this book and the characters are too. It is important to keep in mind that this is one writer's take on a very emotionally charged subject and also not to lose sight that this is a work of fiction. Some people will not like the way in which the Vietnam vets are portrayed; others may simply look at it as a story where some character traits are viable and others are not. I still think that some vet wives or partners might find this book interesting and maybe even helpful."
2,Misleading Marketing Ploy,"To call this book a novel does a disservice to the book and the author. This is a collection of linked stories, and the publisher's attempt to market it as a novel is misleading and infuriating. While a novel can be many things, several elements characterize it as such: pacing, narrative arc, character development, plot development, resolution. Beverly Gologorsky is a talented writer with a lean, taut prose style that pierces the heart of an image or mood. But in this book, she has not made the leap from story-writer to novelist. In fact, she may not even want to: story-writing is as equally challenging and compelling a craft as novel-writing. But simply calling this book a novel to increase sales, prestige or market share doesn't make it one. I was very excited to purchase this book, and walked away very disappointed."
2,Could not finish it!!,"BORING....PREDICITABLE...that is what I would call this movie! I really thought that I was going to be laughing the whole time...guess what...just a few chuckles..that is it...I really tried to give this one a chance, and watched over an hour of it...and I just could not bring myself to watch anymore! Chemistry between the stars was obsolete!I would not recommend this movie to anyone! Sorry!!"
2,Sends Poor Messages to Kids,"While my 7 year old daughter likes this show, I cannot say the same for myself. The most annoying aspect is that the characters are largely ugly, self-centered, and annoying. Even the horses are this way. I don't think this show sends a very good message to children and particularly young girls. And if it is every remotely similar to what the people in the equestrian world are like, I will do everything to keep my daughter away from that world."
4,My daughter loves horses so this was perfect.,"My only ""complaint"" about this is that the dvds come in little packages within the case. Meaning: I have to remove all of the dvds from the dvd case in order to get to the last dvd. It's annoying and I wish that they would have found an alternative, especially for a children's dvd, since my kids like to do it themselves. The actual dvd series is great."
5,Great Series,"My daughter loves this series. It has good morals, all my family that have seen it think it's great also"
3,Talking horses,"Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter who loves the show. Her comment was ""Horses don't really talk- But it's good"".We had not seen the show on TV before.Thought some might want to know that. Also the price went down 9 dollars after I bought it so was unhappy with that, but not fault of manufacturer.All in all, a good buy and lots of entertainment for the kiddies."
3,Gift,I bought Horseland as a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter who loves horses and lives in an area that doesn't provide cable TV. I've never seen any episodes from the series.
3,Do you need a week's worth of kids' cartoons?,"Vapid and silly. The stories are preachy and the ""ethnic"" horses (i.e. ridden by people of color) have accents.Well, I remembered that the kids really liked this cartoon when it was on network tv. Bought it and the kids still like it (surprisingly the three year old is more interested than the 7 year old). It's every episode plus some other cartoons and is 16 plus hours. Worked out very well for the week the kids were both sick. I tried to watch a few episodes with them and wound up reading next to them on the couch while they watched instead. As far as length of cartoon versus cost, this is a winner."
3,"ok, but","This DVD CAN NOT BE VIEWED on Europe's typical DVD player! I have ordered it to EU. The warning was there, although not as clear. However, we were able to play it on computer ( with some hickcaps.) Otherwise --- good that all stories are in one place."
5,Great Movie!!!,Horseland: The Complete Series is such a great movie. It was a birthday present and my niece loves it. Very entertaining. It is worth every penny and shipping was quick. Thank you so much!
5,Great Deal AND kids love it,"After my kids have watched season 2 on TV over and over via an online video provider, I got this complete series for an amazing price. Both my 6 year old girl and 3 year old boy love watching it. Its entertaining and wholesome. No crass language [words like stupid and hate] or mean behavior. I feel completely at ease letting them watch it. The Amazon price for all 39 episodes is fantastic, and any young girl would love it."
5,Horeseland,"I bought this DVD collection for my daughter. She has recently found the show Horseland and has fallen in love with it. It is too bad they are not making it anymore. This is a complete collection of 39 shows on 5 discs. Again, my daughter absolutely loves them and she is 6. The DVDs are way cheaper than buying her a pony!"
5,My girls love it!,"Cute show, my children 6&3 both love it. Has decent messages, and the graphics are great. I would recommend for title who love horses."
5,Great gift,My horse crazy niece will love this as a Christmas present. It will be something that we can watch together.
5,Great Teaching Lessons,"My daughter LOVES horses, so this was a gift to her. It's has awesome teaching lessons on ""rights and wrongs"", how to treat others, etc. She definitely could watch this for hours. I would highly recommend this series."
5,The whole series for a good deal!,I bought this series for my nieces 4th birthday she absolutely loved Horseland! I am so glad I bought it for her! She loves horses and this was the perfect gift. I would recommend this for anyone who has a little girl who is a horse lover! Great price for a ton of episodes!
1,Not role models for my daughter,"I was so excited about this show because my daughter is very into horses. Yes, the final lesson is probably a good one but the viewer (and anyone within earshot) must watch or listen to an entire episode of TERRIBLE behavior and dialogue just to finally get to the final quick-learned lesson. Seriously, my daughter just sits there watching kids (and horses) act horribly for the whole show and then the closing lesson learned is maybe 30 seconds long. The voices of these characters alone are totally grating. I got rid of it and my husband said, ""Thank God""."
4,Good Value!,"DVD set was new, unopened and in excellent condition. Great value to get all the episodes for under $10... There are several hours of viewing, so definitely a good purchase."
5,Great buy!,My daughter loved this show from netflix. As soon as I saw this online it hit the wishlist for her birthday. We've watched it over and over. It's ALL of the horseland episodes.
5,It's worth a 2nd and 3rd look.,"I have read Prodigal Journey, by Linda Paulson Adams, three times now, and enjoy it more each time I read it. The pace is fast, and the story is gripping. This is one book you may want to stay up all night to read."
4,Must read for all,This books brings Sci-Fi and the LDS religion together. This is not an easy task but Linda Paulson Adams is able to successfully accomplish it. I felt Alyssa's pain and cried when Alyssa couldn't due to losing the love of her life.I had an extremely hard time putting this book down and hope to see many more books from this rising new author. Hurry up and complete another book!!
2,Disappointing,"This book surprised me, but not in a good way. The storyline is sometimes hard to swallow, the writing stalls in places, and the little bit of romance seems stilted and false. [SPOILER WARNING] The main character still has not found religion by the end of this 517-page book and we've had to follow her through graphic child abuse, sexual assault, drug addiction, and the sexual excesses and addictions of others. I had an unplesant feeling the entire time I was reading this book, and I will not be reading any more in this series."
4,For the cyberfreaks.,"OK. I guess there's a point to using some of the items, like the eyewares, and it clears up some stuff about dermal armor, but a big part of the book is set aside for something you only to to characters if you don't like them very much-- cybermancy. Man, it's one nasty thing to do! It costs loads of nuyen, can't be purchased without completing a nasty run, and even if the chummer doesn't get killed by cancer or a bullet that manages to wound (not kill, just wound), no one trusts him because they know something's wrong. So I'd have to say the book's okay, but if you have any common sense you'll wind up skipping past about a third of the book."
4,too much focus on cybermancy,"This book is great, with some good gear, but a whole lot of this stuff depends on one's knowledge of the stuff in the Street Sam catalog, Fields of Fire, and Shadowtech"
3,"Some interesting new gadgets, but an outlandish ending.","The entire section on Cybermancy, and everything to do with it, is complete and total nonsense. Without any apologies, borgs and cyberware pretty much work out like Appleseed in my campaign (try getting any Bri-type character in Shadowrun's crippled Essence-Loss/Cyberware mechanic; HAH!). Borgs and cyberpunk go together, and that's the final say on the matter.The coverage of the various pieces of equipment by a single ""shadowrunner"", giving his opinions, lends a sort of unified flavor the beginning of the book, which I did like.Be prepared to spend money for sections you'll never use, though (specfically, Cybermancy)."
4,Game Masters BEWARE!!!,"As always we find that we have access to yet another Sourcebook that is going to stir up a lot of trouble between Runners and Game Masters. So that is why I give Cybermancy a rating of ""R"" (Game Master discretion is advised.) Sure there are some wiz gadgets and some excellent reading in here but come on, CYBERMANCY?!? If any GM were to incorporate this in a mission as anything other than here-say or armagedon, then I think we all have to sit down and re-evaluate why we began playing this game. Not to take away from another of Tom Dowd's well written and emmensely entertaining books but if this book is not used properly it could contribute to the breakdown of the very game play we struggle to preserve.H.A.V.O.C."
4,Excellent enterprise calendar,"The interface is easy to work with and is clear and straight forward. Except for a few glitches when upgrading from version 3.0 this has been a stable program. Palm sync feature is nice, overall the software is almost as good as Entourage from Microsoft, but this app allows for network calendaring over the internet and within your LAN, Entourage does not."
2,Finished reading out of curiosity,"Not really a vampire book and could've done completely without them as characters. I finished the book mostly out of curiosity as to what could possbily come out of the ending. As it turns out, nothing. It seems like the author ran into a deadline and rapidly rapped up the book as fast as possible, without any complete build-up or any real feeling of conlcusion.A quick read for an airplane flight or for the bathroom."
3,Strange book,"I'm not at all certain what Fred Saberhagen had in mind here. I fear that he had a fantasy novel in mind that he simply tried to squeeze into his Dracula franchise. Interesting, but not a good fit into the Dracula series."
1,"Old fashioned ""You are under my power"" hypnosis","The only good thing about this book is the hypnotic discs that come with it. Other than that, this book is a joke. May as well have been written 100 years ago. Typical voodoo witch doctor hypnosis wherein the client doesn't have a clue what's being done to them. Don't waste your money. If you want to learn hypnosis, there's a few good books out there. This is not one of them."
4,Good book! It's a bit too detailed for just reading it!,Tepperwein brings in a lot of techniques for beginners as well as for professionals. It's worth reading for everybody interested in hypnosis
1,Stanley Goes for a Drive????,"As a graphic design student, the illustrations were very blocky and modern looking, and I could deal with that part of the book. Maybe it is just me, but the story of the book was very hard to follow. How could Stanley just be driving along the dry countryside and decide all of a sudden to stop and milk a spotted cow. If you think this is strange, I haven't gotten to the best part yet. Once he is finished with the milking apparently something ""strange happens"" and then...it gets stranger! Oooo...He throws the milk into the air, which turns into clouds and rains all over the land changing the scenery! Then he gets back into his truck and drives off. Woo hoo! The end. I don't know about you, but I am not sure kids are going to understand what is going on. Save your $16 because this isn't really worth checking out of the library."
5,Stanley Goes for a Drive,My 3 year old grandson loves this book! We read it at least 4 times a day. He is almost to the point that he can read it by heart. Every good book for early learners.
1,Stanley,"I read this book before I read it to my grandsons who are 6 and 3. After reading it, I had a feeling it wouldn't be a fun book for them, but I went ahead and read it to them. As much as I could tell, they didn't enjoy the book either."
2,poor collection,"This compilation is a poor review of Dangerous Toys' legacy. While it contains the grungy sound of Better to Die and Share the Kill from the R*tist 4*Merly Known as Dangerous Toys, it only has live versions of masterpieces such as Teas'n, Pleas'n, Scared, and Sport'n a Woody. It is also lacking the boogie juggernaut that is Ten Boots (Stompin'). In other words, an absolute waste of money. I wouldn't suggest buying it. But a fan of grunge might. Not a way to start your collection."
4,Nice Blanket,"I wouldn't call this a ""bed"", it's more like a blanket a dog can burrow in. It is very thick and heavy but still doesn't provide enough cushion as a bed - I use it on top of my dog's bed. It will most definitely keep a dog warm, even a hairless dog, if the dog knows how to go in it. I have a 10 pounder and he lies on his side with his legs stretched out (comfortably) inside the blanket and sticks his head out because he is no longer cold. I washed it twice so far and it washed perfectly but there is some shedding still."
5,Loving It!,I'm loving this tea. The product was shipped quickly. Though the tea doesn't have a deep color the flavor is a nice mild flavor. What I love about this tea is that you can brew three cups with the same tbsp of tea leaves. While the color may get lighter the flavor is still there. This makes it an even more money saving. This tea is good hot or cold.
4,Favorite tea,"This is my favorite type of Chinese tea. I had previously purchased some during a trip to China. In comparison to the Grade A tea I had, this one has good flavor, whole leaves, and was beautifully packaged in a lovely keepsake tin, similar to many I saw in China. I would rate it A-."
2,Not great,I am very much into Oolongs and this did not taste like Iron Goddess of Mercy.The tea does not look clean (there were some sticks in it) and tastes grassy to me.I guess you get what you pay for. You can't get a true Iron Goddess of Mercy for so little.Shipping was fast and the tin is cute.
3,First step into oolong,"Earthy, sour flavor... but not very aromatic. I don't know how indicative this is of Tikuanyin though!I do enjoy it more every time that I have a cup of it though, and it goes very well with light lunch foods."
5,My son's favorite toy in the car!,"While searching for toys to keep in the car, I came across this Busy Driver. My son absolutely loves it! I highly recommend the toy as it is durable and engaging without being too annoying."
1,Too noisy and the key has broken off!,"My son has some fun with this toy. However, there are some important issues you should take into consideration while planning to buy it.First of all, it's VERY noisy. It's still too loud even in the running car. The key is mounted on the rope and my son managed to solve the not. Fortunately this element isn't that small to be swallowed, but anyway it can get lost easier. The sounds are nice and quite true, if only they were more silent..."
4,Solid Fundamental principes,"This is a long DVD, so be patient. I watched the whole DVD and found it helpful for myself and my children.It goes over the basic steps and correct form of how to shoot a basketball. It has drills that allow you to repeat the steps so that it becomes second nature.Rick does a good job explaining things - sometimes too much so. He can sometimes be a bit long winded.Overall a helpful and effective DVD for teaching and improving the right shooting form."
5,Gift,This was a gift for my Mother who was looking for a Flan Pan. She was very happy with the item. She said it was well made and of good quality and would last for a long time.
3,Good for discrete drill-practices only,"It is designed as workbooks to help learners practice with discrete grammar points. These books claim to be structural and communicative and to provide contextualized exercises. However, all those exercises are controlled exercises, and there is no chance for problem-solving and opinion-negotiation in those exercises. Learners have no control over those fixed dialogues and fill-in-blank exercises. The exercises are actually designed for drills practice of discrete grammar structures, but there is no real communicative value embedded in these exercises. Still, the formate is pleasant. Each unit usually has only two pages, so it does not take much time to finish exercises in one unit."
3,Blind lash Primer,"This product does what it states, however, it comes out very thick and when you apply to lashes it feels very wet"
3,"Dated, but not useless","Although this text is almost 20 years old, it remains a useful resource for basic background information on Marxist ideas and their development throughout the 20th century. A second hand copy of this text at the right price is certainy worth having for anyone studying topics related to Marxist thinking in the cold war era of the 20th century. More useful, of course, for historical background than contemporary thinking"
3,An incredibly cheesy 60's SF story,"The characters were wooden, the plot thin, the sociology questionable. But you know what? I don't care! I read this for the first time 20 yrs ago, and just re-read it last week. It is entertaining, and I never expected more..."
5,The best concert I have ever seen!,"I have been going to concerts 38 years, this one is a ""must see"" and I havent found one that comes close. Why this isnt available on DVD is beyond me. This was a special treat that comes around far to little but you will remember the rest of your life. Doug"
5,"""I'd Rather Go Blind"" is the best song I've ever heard!","I love the song ""I'd Rather Go Blind"" by Etta & Dr. John. You don't have to love the blues to be deeply moved by this song. And the rest of the video is great too."
4,Forward to Fallback,Although publsihed in 1982 Fallback tells a story that could easily have been written today. Peter Niesewand: A truly great writer and man with a vision!
2,I know why this book is out of print!,"Fallback is an entertaining read for about 200 pages. As soon as I understood what the ""fallback"" scenario was, I was sickened by the change in the story line. What started as an engaging, engrossing and believable cold war/espionage thriller quickly turned, in the span of two pages, into unbelievable sci-fi junk.The ""fallback"" scenario had me laughing! The primary character, a likeable DIA agent, is ""sanctioned"", his brain intentionally destroyed so that his body can be used as a vessel for the brain of the other primary character, a dying computer consultant with the knowledge to save the world from a Soviet first-strike nuclear attack. Are you kidding me? A brain transplant?I finished the next 200 pages, but the book didn't impress me and I certainly won't go out of my way to find Peter Neisewand's other book."
4,A Special Place,"I thought this would be a fun read and I was not dissapointed. First of all you need to own an Island, not be able to live on it and be a dangerous place to visit. The makings of a great story by a masterful story teller.The ""how"" of how he got the Island is as interesting as his view of them. Of all the places in the world to earn a living, why would you choose this. Visit and enjoy but not try to live and earn a living. Wonderful tale."
4,The Ultimate Island Getaway,A compelling book about the realities of life in the Scottish Islands. Adam has done an excellent job of blending historical details with his descriptions of this area. Well worth a read!
1,Was not what it said it was,"Was not as specified wrong brand ,wrong size.Did not fit properly was not thick enought to fit service tech said it would not take water correctly"
5,Humidifier Filter,This filter fit my humidifier perfectly. I took the original out of the filter holder and placed the new one in. I received the product as scheduled.
5,Carrier Humidifier Replacement Filter Pad,"The package was received in a timely manner, with a complete shipment, well packaged, and for a competitive price. I was able to easily replace the old one in my humidifier very easily."
5,Perfect Fit!,This was a perfect replacement water pad for my Carrier Furnace Humidifier. Fit without any modifications andwas very easy to change.
3,Why are they thinner than OEM product,"These pads are about 1/4"" thinner than OEM product. Was expecting them to be a direct replacement. Other dimensions are identical to OEM."
3,"size 1/4 is does not trim hair to 1/4""","I was confused by the wording of the advertisement. Be aware that size 1/4 indicates the number of the comb. It really trims the hair to 11/16""."
5,good drill,"when i became tile setter several years ago,there are no many brand drill used in mixing thinset mortar,dewalt is one.i like the durability this drill,so do many other tile setters."
5,DEWALT DW 130V DRILL,I purchased this drill to mix thinset after burning up an older half inch drill. The DEWALT 130 works great. I have no problem mixing a full bag of thinset with this drill. It was a great drill at a great price.
2,"Drill works well for mixing, but handle won't stay screwed in","I bought this to use to mix mortar for a DIY tile job. It did a good job of mixing the mortar, but the single handle grip would not stay screwed into any of the three optional locations for the round grip handle. The female screw threads on the drill were at least 1/2 deep, but the male threads exposed beyond the plastic handle grip were only about 3/16 from the plastic backer. No matter how tight I tried to screw the handle in, it would pop out because the male threaded bolt was not long enough to catch properly. Another example of DeWalt quality going downhill. I won't be buying any more Dewalt tools.Delivery from Amazon was quick as always."
5,Life Changing BUY THIS MOVIE!,This movie is the best documentary on Cannabis ever. I formally believe that everyone on this earth needs to see this movie. Getting the package overall was perfect. No complaints. JUst watch the movie to open your eyes on our lying government.
5,Had An Epiphany,"After years of listening to most everything negative that has ever been said about cannabis, this documentary completely and forever changed my view on the subject. I am not going to quote the documentary or rant and rave about the topic of cannabis legalization here in this review. I instead would like to let people know that this is a very well made documentary. For myself it shattered myths about cannabis and got me interested in the topic. I have since read many books by various authors and various views on cannabis. If someone is interested in this topic this video is excellent. It in no ways puts out a message that everyone should smoke cannabis. It just lays out the facts on the table leaving the viewer to decide for him or herself."
4,One Bad*** Documentary,"The Union, is one MUST SEE experience of the business involved with the ""devil's herb"". It provides realistic views on both sides of the Drug War and laws in the United States. Smoker or non-smoker, this documentary has a contagious effect to be very eye-opening, even to the one-sided, closed-minded public. I myself, am a fan of the classic ""Reefer Madness"" tell your children escapade of 1936 but The Union proves worthy to defeat most common and reasonable myths of medicinal and recreational marijuana use."
5,Best Canabis Documentary Ever Made,"One of the best documentaries I have seen in years. The best Canabis documentary to date. It approaches every subject on the revolutionary plant. I think it is necessary to say I do not use canabis, but I do support it's legalization after watching..."
5,The light at the end of the tunnel,"It is amazing how hypocritical the government is there is no power like the power of the people because the power of the people wont stop. This movie will show the light to everybody on why Marijuana is the almighty plant whether you consider it a drug, pain reliever, way to get and appetite for anybody who disagrees with Cannabis or LOVES it you should not only see this movie you should own it and show it to the world."
5,WOW,A documentary I really enjoyed! This was very well done and I really recommend everyone see it. Nice!!!
4,ARRrrrrr!!!,"The first 3 books in the series were by far the best (the betrayal the secret and the burning) then the next 1- 10 were great........but after that it just kinda goes downhill, like off the original subject... but the book itself was good"
5,a Look at a life of a Novel by the only man that could do it,"James Michener once again uses his craft to tell a story that he knows best: the story of a Novel. An interesting note about this book is that it is divided into four parts, and each part is narrarated by a different person, each a different part of the writing process. First, the Writer tells of his life in Dutch Pennsylavania and the trials of writing his final novel. Next, his Editor tells of her past and how she came to be one of the best in her business and her battle to keep her writer from being dropped. Third, a Critic, who teaches a a near-by college, tells of his own struggle to be a writer and his envy of the Writer's fame. Finally, the Reader becomes involved with the other three to solve a mystery that affects them all. As always, Michener both entertains and educates. This is a must-read for anyone who is a writer, wants to be a writer, or just likes to read."
2,Lecture and speculation,"The Novel is a decent work, which tries at times to emulate both models of the American novel it brings into conflict. So far, so good. But the characters were all too similar, often in background, always in broad intersests. Each section ends hanging, supposedly brought together at the end, but it doesn't work. Minor characters take over, until the fourth narrator becomes expendible. The book reads like a lecture, complete with reading list. Michener's typical blend of tolerance and judgement is not dramatic here, but a wash, slices of life without the meaning essential in literature."
3,Not his best writing,"James Michener has not done his best writing here. Gone is the almost anthropologist-like view of an exotic culture which this reader delights in when sunk deep into greats like Centennial, The Source, The Covenant etc. He does his best work when writing about places other than his own--eastern Pennsylvania. Was it autobiographical? I hope not!"
3,Makes you want to write The Novel,"This book is great in openning up the sphere of writing and the process of bringing the book into fruition and see it become a success. The one disillusioning fact about the book is that the mystery which is promised on the back does not happen until the very last part of the book and is rushed through to the end -- more concerned with the message it tries to send than with the plot development. The most rewarding thing about ""The Novel"" is that it makes you want to writing a book. No other book propelled in me such desire."
1,The only book I've ever been unable to finish,"Well, there was one other book, a trashy novel, but I barely even strated that one. I gave this a very fair shake, read more than 1/2 of it and found it unbearable. Just so dull. I later learned that many Michener diehards did not like it either, so I was relieved that I'm not a total dolt who just didn't get it. A friend told me it's very slow starting but gets good later. I may have to try again someday, if only because I can't stand not finishing something!"
2,Maybe I'll try him again later ? ?,"I was surprised that I wasn't able to finish ""The Novel"" . After hearing about Michener as one of America's more talented writers I leaped at the chance to purchase ""The Novel"" when I happened upon it while thrift shopping. After reading the jacket and skimming a few pages I thought for sure this would be a great read. ""The Novel"" is actually a series of short stories whose theme centers on the writing and publication of a novel. The story is told from the perspectives of the writer, editor, critic, and reader. As an aspiring writer I was immediately intrigued by the theme. As a reader I was slowly disappointed in the book's inability to maintain my interest. The writing was fine but the story moved along a bit too slow for me. With over 450 pages a quicker pace is needed. While I can't recommend ""The Novel"", I will give Michener another opportunity to live up to his reputation."
5,The best Lego Star Wars creation yet,"I was amazed by the beauty of Lego's X-Wing Fighter. This ship is truly the most faithful adaptation of a Star Wars craft, and is a sight to behold. In terms of realism, it easily surpasses any other spaceship in the Lego collection. The techs at Lego are also to be praised for the ship's functionality. The wings open and close using standard Lego ratchet-hinges, which allows them to lock in either position. The hatch opens easily and gives easy access. R2-D2 is also present and fits snugly in his compartment, right where he should be. There are even two cargo spaces, to store lightsabers, etc.I suppose my judgment is biased by that fact that I think the X-Wing Fighter is the most attractive spacecraft in the entire Star Wars movie series (with the possible exception of Queen Amidala's transport), but I cannot imagine a Lego enthusiast passing this up. And, hey! -- your kids will like it, too!"
5,Won my Heart!!,"I read about 4 to 5 books a week, but this one really touched my heart! The minute I started reading, I was in the story.The story is so real and the author describes everything as if you can see it in front of you. Tom and Angee have the sweetest love, I wanted to be Angee just reading it! I hated Tom's mother, but Angee won her over. Everyone that meets her, can't help but love her, they all understand how Tom is so inlove with her and their devotion to each other. Even Tom's friend couldn't break them up, he saw how beautiful Angee was inside and out and wanted her for himself. Everything that these two go through to be together and then tragedy hits!Oh My God, I was completely crushed and my husband was laughing at me for crying over a book.I went to the authors website and emailed her regarding the ending. She wrote back theres a sequel coming and my broken heart will be mended. I can't wait! Best I read in a long time."
3,BY FAR FROM BEING A BIBLE,"This book will give a general overview on the different labors inside the corporate communications job.It contains some really interesting interviews made to certain experts in the field but don't expect to get the secret to success.It would have been a really good book if less space for the interviews would have been used and more information on the different aspects of corporate communications.At the begining of chapter 1 there is a phrase that says ""Normally the press is neither friendly nor hostile. They are just after the stiry""; Any public relations expert knows that some stories will always recive hostile treatment from the press.Maybe in the future I will use this book to do some research but at the present time I will keep it in my book shelf."
1,"description needs to ""tell all""",The Fagor Ten-Quart pressure cooker information should include the fact that the cooker does not contain a canning rack and does not have a complete range of pressures available to can with.I could not use it for my canning.Fagor Splendid 10-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner
5,Pressure cooker,I use this quite a bit. I bought it so I could can/bottle food from my garden but I have never used it for that. I usually use it for dinner when I didn't start it in time. I love it. It seems very safe. I have had it for about 3 years now. Still happy with it!I do with I had a smaller one since most of the time I am using it I am making dinner for a family of 4 and I don't need it to be this big. It has come in handy for when I cook larger meals for other people or left overs.
5,Fagor 10 qt. pressure cooker/canner,I received the Fagor 10 qt pressure cooker/cannerBUT YOU DID NOT SEND WITH THE CANNER THE BASKET JAR LIFTER I ONLY RECEIVED THE RACK TO SIT THE JARS ON WHEN I ORDERED THE CANNER THE BASKET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDEDWHICH I DO NEED THE BASKET JAR HOLDERLINDA KING
2,Disappointed,"This Fagor was very well made and I'm sure would do the job if you only needed to pressure cook/can on HIGH.There is no way to adjust the cooking from 5psi, 10psi...only 15psi. Was not explained fully in the description."
5,Foodie son in law proclaims this the single best piece of cooking equipment of his life,"Since they live in Denver at altitude, I thought this would be a great addition to their newly renovated kitchen--with an induction cooktop. Daughter reported in January that it had been used every single day since unwrapping at Christmas. They are both involved in the high end restaurant business and intense foodies/cooks/gardeners. With work schedules, it isn't always possible to have long cooking times for food.The larger size of this one was chosen in order to accomodate the possibility of cooking short ribs, lamb shanks, and larger pieces of meat. It has more than met expectations.I wish that more product specifications would say whether it was induction cooking useable."
5,"Great product, but poor shipping","We have the 10 quart splendind model, and wanted to get one for my mom as a present because we like it so much. The first one arrived damaged (long handle on the pot was broken off), and now the second one arrived damaged (support handle on the pot was broken off). I have no complaints about the product, just the condition of the product upon arrival."
3,False advertising of product,"I received my very pertty Fagor 10 qt. Pressure Cooker/Canner yesterday and had planned to can green beans today. Looks like the fresh beans will go to waste. The problem... Fagor did not tell me when I ordered my CANNER that it was incomplete and required that I buy additional parts inorder to use it. You can't can without the required,but not included,jar rack. When I contacted Fagor America they told me I would have to buy a rack but did not offer any information as to where to buy such a item. I had also asked them to why in one place of the instructions it said you put 2 to 3 inches of water in the canner and yet the examples given in the book said to cover jars with water.Their answer was it was a type O. I think they need to get their act together. It is sure a pertty thing but useless without a rack."
3,Not dishwasher safe,"I am a huge fan of pressure cookers (this is my fourth or fifth, of various sizes). This one works fine and is a great size, but I managed to ruin part of it by washing it in the dishwasher. This was written clearly in the instructions (I discovered this after the fact), but it didn't occur to me that something without any sort of special coating that is intended for such heavy use would not be dishwasher-friendly.The truth is, it wasn't the best even before I wrecked it, but it was perfectly adequate, even if I had to adjust it multiple times."
1,Do not buy,This pressure cooker is the poorest quality I have ever seen. The lid fits so loose that it can not build up any pressure. I had the stove on high fo 40 minutes and it never built up any pressure at all. The steams leaked out from all around the edges of the lid. I would not recommend this at all.
1,False Advertising,"I received my order today and don't believe the product description. There's NO stainless-steel steamer basket included and the instruction manual states that this pressure cooker is NOT dish-washer safe. While I plan to keep my order, I'll be more cautious ordering from Amazon again; if I order from them again. Don't believe everything you read. Caveat emptor."
2,Blue-Ray That's Less Than DVD,"What a disappointment. I specifically purchased this set because I wanted to revisit That's Entertainment in Hi-fidelity, but the quality turned out to be that of a poorly performing DVD. What's the matter with Warner Bros.? It can turn out marvelously reproduced copies of old Warners films in either DVD or Blu-ray, but does not spend the extra capital on MGM classics."
3,"Great Content, Dubious Mastering","Since this boxed set has already been critiqued extensively and in detail by others, my aim here is simply to echo the comments of those who praised the rich array of both original and supplemental material made available in the collection, while at the same time, concurring with those few brave contrarians who slammed the quality of the transfers. Indeed, the individual who emphasized the particularly woeful job done on Part 2 is right on the money; and the pan-and-scan side of the disc is even worse than the widescreen (those who rave about the great digital transfers should have either their eyes or their heads examined -- preferably both). The other volumes are substantially better, but considering the value of this footage, re-releasing it in the age of DVD without a thorough digital restoration represents a degree of parsimony and shoddiness that can only be termed disgraceful."
3,We Deserve Better,"It's high time these films were brought to us in DVD, but the quick-and-dirty (often very dirty) transfers really take the bloom off the rose. The aspect ratio issue was handled well, but that's about the best we can say for these third-rate transfers.Material like this deserves proper restoration for its DVD release. Instead, we get color shifts, heavy grain, overwhelming amounts of negative dirt, mars, and scratches. We are even treated to scribed cue marks on the transfer print of show #2. To see changeover cues on a 2004 digital transfer represents the height of ""who cares"" sloppiness.Perhaps some day down the road, this material will be given the ""Criterion treatment"" that it deserves. Meanwhile, we'll have to enjoy it through all the obvious deficiencies of this carelessly-made edition."
5,Priceless Classics,Originally bought this for my mother but I ended up watching it with her and enjoying as much as she did. Its a must have for any collection!!
2,"Entertainment,yes--enhanced,no","If you DON'T previously own these marvelous films at all--spring for the BLURAY--If,like myself, you were hoping to be amazed with MGM bluray splendor over and above the previous DVD set--don't waste the money.That about sums it up--the films are 5stars, the 2 stars if the rating of the necessity of re-purchasing for bluray quality"
5,That's Entertainment (3-box DVD set),"A great trilogy for older folks who remember the great MGM musicals. Has snippets and scenes that will bring back fond memories of great musicals. Younger people will find these ""documentaries"" an interesting and enjoyable introduction to some of the finest musical films produced in the past.... in these days of CGI, there's a lot more to offer with real people."
1,ripped off,I received the 3 DVD boxed set of That's Entertainment and it doesn't work! We've tried these DVD's in many players and they do not work! Disappointed to say the least!
2,classic films would be nice,"this is not really worth owning i for one am no musical fanatic but i own enough of the greats on dvd already and this is just samples and documentaries why would this be released on blu ray before say the actual musicals depicted in this set? who knows what they are thinking! their are yet to be any real classics in musical, drama, thriller, noir, gangster, silents etc. released on blu ray aside from a few war and john wayne westerns there is nothing(and im not a john wayne fan) recently a myrna loy, william powell set and a garland and rooney set have been released on regular dvd and a barbara stanwyk set coming to dvd next month why not to blu ray with these sets? id recommend not buying this its really not worth owning. lets hope some classic ""films"" will be released soon"
5,That's Entertainment is everything as promised.,The product I ordered came to me on schedule and was exactly asadvertised. I'm very happy with this transaction and would not hesitate to make a purchase through Amazon again.
5,THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!,This DVD is the most beautifull thing of the golden age of movies.I love it !!
5,A musical extravaganza,"I have always loved the Hollywood musical and this compilation of all the great movies and inimitable performers that graced the silver screen for the greater part of three decades, certainly brings back so many wonderful memories of a genre that has all but disappeared.If,like me, you're a fan of musicals, then I promise you that you won't be disappointed if you decide to add this box set to your movie collection."
5,Classic Moments !!,Excellent collection of memorable musical moments. The finest artists of the time at their best. Delightful for an audience of any age.
5,THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT MY FRIENDS!!!!,"An amazing compilation of the best musicals produced by the american studio system. Certainly the best collection for musical lovers, students or people who want to dive into this magical world as we can't find it anymore."
3,Interesting but draggy at times.,"I bought this set with the understanding that it is of more historical than entertainment value. The first installment of the series is excellent and entertaining all the way through, but subsequent installments tend to drag at times. I felt that Judy Garland got a little too much screen time in the later installments, as well as some of Gene Kelly's modern dance numbers in the later installments. This sort of entertainment is still far superior to 99% of what passes as family entertainment today, and it is excellent for showcasing the superior talents of yesteryear compared to the less than stellar attitudes and behavior exhibited by so many of today's ""stars"", both on and off screen. These are the kind of shows that you may only watch once a year, unless you are a big musical or MGM buff, but they are worth having in your collection even on that basis."
5,You want Musicals - You Got Musicals!,"The best collection of scenes from various MGM musicals over the years available without a doubt. This first ""That's Entertainment"" is much longer than I thought but features many favorites scenes from a wide variety of MGM musicals. It is hosted by a wide variety of stars (including Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.) And a great part is it was shot on the now non-existent MGM Back Lot (most of what you see in the wraps no longer exists.) Parts 2 and 3 include more scenes from various films and a few different perspectives - part 3 shows how well rehearsed Fred Astaire would be with his dances.) If you like movie musicals, this collection is a MUST!"
5,That's Entertainment Trilogy CD's,Great complilation of some of the great moments in musical history. All generations can enjoy looking back at some of the greats!!
1,That's Entertainment It Is But On Blu Ray It's Also Grainy Entertainment,"Good movie set botched on blu ray, though I do love these films.I'm starting to wonder if these films even though they were theatrical releases were originally shot with video tape because the blu rays higher quality seems to betray the low video quality.However I may downgrade this and get the DVD set instead and give this box set to an enemy because you sure wouldn't offload this on a friend.Oh by the way, why did I purchase this you may ask, after so many previous warnings here, well I was in hope that Warner had recalled and fixed it by now, alas no such luck, maybe they can't fix it because it was shot with video tape.Anyway buy the DVD set, I'm going to."
3,fun but flawed,"It is fun to see a lot of these great Hollywood (that is, MGM) musicals and the stars performing. The main annoyance is that thenarrators frequently speak while the sequences are beginning and they end up being clips rather than the whole performance as seen in the original film. At some point I wish they'd just show the performances and not have any narrators."
1,Video Quality much less than expected,Most of the earlier video especially the black and white ones look very grainy. The regular DVDs appear to look more natural than this. This needs several rounds of refactoring before it is ready for prime-time. Hold off for now.
4,Poor Transfers Lots of BW Grain,"That's Entertainment in Blu-Ray 1080p. Should be wonderful. Should be sharp.But it actually is an immense dissapointment on Blu-Ray. Most BW clips are incredibley grainy. There are several audio drop-outs. People have argued with me that it's because it is supposed to be there. Baloney. In this day of Blu-Ray, there shouldn't be any distraction from the art, because of technical problems. The same with the last release of Wizard of Oz, which was also incredibly grainy. I therefore watch the 1999 release, which has a sharp, but not grainy picuture. It is too bad because I expected ""That's Entertainment"", in Blu-ray to be altogether better than the DVD collection. This is my fourth version. (1984 Single TE Laserdisc,VHS, DVD) And the last. The DVD version is actually better over-all. But I will always love the content of ""That's Entertainment."""
3,Very Disappointing Video Quality!,"Like a past reviewer I also have the same package on standard DVD. Any improvement is barely discernable if at all. Even the interviews specific to the documentary have that worn '70s' look. This must be a transfer from the original film, and there doesn't seem to be any signs of 'digital restoration'. Idealy, what would unfortunatly prove too costly, some one should 'snip out' the the documentary's clips of ""Singing In The Rain"", ""Wizard Of Oz"", and all of the hundred or so original movie clips and insert the new remastered clips from the digitaly restored movies. I have many of these and they are certainly much better, cleaner and vibrant than the documentary's clips, and that's on standard DVD! Maybe some day.If you have 'That's Entertainment' on standard DVD, don't bother upgrading! Three stars though because it still is an excellent documentary."
1,The company changed the number of tablets from 90 to 60,"When I bought this item, it was advertised as having 90 tablets per bottle. Tao of Herbs refused to send me the missing number of tablets and blamed Amazon for the error. Amazon opened an investigation into the matter. Be careful buying products here: you may get something totally unexpected."
4,Two funny Star Wars spoofs in one attractive package,"Whether you are a Family Guy or Star Wars fan, there is a lot to like about these movies. Knowledge of one or the other is necessary to enjoy most of the jokes, but it is still funny even if some references go over your head. (This is no different than an average episode of Family Guy, where the average person may miss a handful of pop-culture jokes and still enjoy the humor overall.)Both movies are short. I ordered this set to watch with a friend and we watched both in one sitting, along with some of the extras.If you haven't seen either movie yet, and can't wait for them to eventually release the third movie (and the inevitable box set), this is a great deal."
5,Best Family Guy Yet,"For the die hard FG fans, both segments are hysterical. Being a big star wars fan, I can totally appreciate the amazing attention to detail in the episodes from the music all the way to explosions.I only wish there was an edited version that I could show my kids. My kids love Star Wars and they have caught me watching FG and they have seen some of the shows accidentally and they love it too. I dont let them hear or see anything adult.I really enjoyed the commentary feature while watching. I like to hear all the behind the scenes stuff. There is some good info to be had here (e.g. Mark Hamill did NOT like the line where Han Solo says his is the only career not completely destroyed by the movie)"
3,Good for Star Wars fans but...,"The second edition of this series was not nearly as funny as the first. I might be mad I bought this if I had not used a gift card. But then, it's Family Guys, so it's always at least a little bit funny"
3,"Good, but strongly rated.","It is a good book, but it is a little strong. More suitable for older readers."
3,It's Cool and Crisps at the Same Time,"This product does what it advertises to do. My frozen pizza (thin crust from Trader Joe's) comes out crispy and cooked all the way through.Only 3 stars because even though the pan is sturdy -- should last for years -- and will support a typically loaded pizza (medium/large or smaller) it will flex. Because of this, IMHO, the pan will not support a deep dish pie without the help of both hands."
2,Union Troops of the American Civil War (Europa Militaria) (Paperback),The book is almost a re-make of Union Troops of the American Civil War (Europa Militaria) (Paperback. I appears that the reenactors are the same as the Union book with jackets changed. Again this was clearly photograghed in Europe and the authenticity standards are not as high as in the US. There are a number of authenticity problems. Using the wrong colors and wrong breeds for the horses used in the cavalry photos is an example of the inaccuracies that hurt the book.
2,Blah,Very unsatisfied. The sweaters I dyed turned black..kinda.. the jeans I dyed turned a dark greenish blue. Now I get to wear these weird tinted jeans around. Totally wrecked them. Thanks a lot.
4,"Sexy , Deep- rich and memorable scent",This sultry scent is one that lingers but does not cloy. I first found DG in a Neiman Marcus in St. Louis while whiling away another boring evening on a business trip in a strange city. This has become my personal favorite evening scent- rich and elegant- it works well with my personal chemistry. My other favorite scents tend toward the citrusy day scents like Dior Dolce Vita or the spicy Red Door by Arden- I am not a Poison or Giorgio girl- too heavy for me. If you prefer a lighter but rich scent DG is one to try- and very hard to find! Prices here on Amazon are great and convenient as NM does not take Visa/MC.
3,In Silence There Are Ghosts--A Small Town Reverie,"In Silence There are Ghosts is an example of Small Town USA's inhibititions gone exhibitionist. The book deals with a divorcee returning home after many years and discovering the underlying secrets of a town she realizes that she never really knew. This includes her parents and the secrets surrounding her older sister's death. The book's undercurrent deals with the psuedochristain attitudes displayed by the town members and how the overlaying Christain layer, once scraped away, reveals a decaying sense of immorality amoung its members. The book gives a good sketch of the protagonist and her unwitting discovery of the true nature of the town and her family."
4,An excellent and broad review of the life of Sig Olson.,"Anyone who has enjoyed the incredible beauty of Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area owes a debt to Sigurd Olson, subject of David Backe's ""A Wilderness Within"". This well-written book helps us understand Sig and how his intense passion to become a significant writer intertwined with his deep spiritual need for wilderness. The book may go a bit overboard in emphasizing some of his shortcomings: his temper, his need to be important, his occasional mistakes, but it also makes clear how much those close to him loved him. It is painful to consider how much the northern Minnesota wilderness would have been developed and decimated but for his efforts. TH Bracken MD Onamia MN"
3,"Functional, but lethal","This is a good, sturdy tart pan. While the coating is pretty good, it doesn't cover the edges, thereby exposing the underlying metal, and it's starting to rust there already, even with meticulous hand washing.And, along those lines, this pan cut the LIFE out of my hand when washing it. That top, uncoated edge is razor sharp, and when all lubed up with soap and applying pressure to wash the bits of tart out of the nooks and crannies, the pan slipped and sliced 3 fingers. I was bleeding for days; the cuts were deep. Usually, I'd chalk this up to idiocy, but I have no idea what I would have done differently. I think from now on, I will actually hold it in a padded oven mitt, wash thoroughly, and then toss the mitt in the wash. I'm not kidding, it WILL happen again."
3,Not as good as part one or three but the most unique!,"There are some gems in this 1976 edition of ""That's Entertainment"", but seeing Fred and Gene trying to dance and clown was hard for me to watch. Although they were energetic and supreme in their craft in their heyday, they are obviously trying too hard to be entertaining within the context of introducing the clips. It was heartwarming, but somehow painful to watch them TRYING to be great again. I would have much preferred them to simply introduce the clips in dignified fashion... and surprise... that's exactly what the producers did in ""That's Entertainment part 3"" in 1994. It worked as beautifully as it did in the first edition. Both 1 and 3 also concentrated on MUSICAL numbers, and part 2 does not... it seemed to mock the old musical style more than present it. Having said that, there are some real gems here... so I gave it only 3 stars. Part 1 and 3 are 5 star movies."
4,Astaire and Kelly's MGM History Tour,"Admittedly not in the same league as its illustrious predecessor, ""That's Entertainment, Part II"" (1976) manages to dig up more treasures from the MGM vault. Hosts Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly provide some fancy footwork in the new segments (their effortless rapport makes you wish they collaborated more often). The comedy tributes are a nice touch while the best musical numbers put a smile on your face. Esther Williams' spectacular waterskiing sequence from ""Easy to Love"" is worth the price of admission. Special kudos to Saul Bass' opening titles. The double-sided DVD includes widescreen and full-screen versions plus the original theatrical trailer."
3,very infomative,showed alot of clips from MGM vault and they were good.I am not a big fan but my mom melane grew up with these movies and i'm sure she loves them
3,second place,"I enjoyed That's Entertainment PT. 1 a great deal. Part 2 was disappointing in that it was too much like part 1, but not as good, and had little new to commend it. Few new stars, few new ideas."
4,This book is very good,"The author has done a very good work, like other exam cram books. However, I will advise the author to review and issue a new edition that will include NLS and Audit. In summary, I would like to commend the author for a good job. I will send some useful comments/corrections to the author/ publisher that could be useful for new edition of the book. With other reference materials(Couchman's book - though not very good for inexperience DBAs because of some errrors, cramsession review notes and Oracle manuals, STS Practice test) I was able to score 62/63."
3,Beware if you are going for the 8i version..,"This probably was a good book for 8.0.x but for 8i this book is far too easy! The questions in the book are highly similar to (or same as) those in the Self-Test software (from Oracle). However, I found the exam to be lot more complex. For example, the actual exam questions try very hard to confuse you with similar sounding names for views - viz. V$TRANSACTIONS, DBA_TRANSACTIONS, ALL_TRANSACTIONS, USER_TRANSACTIONS as choice for an answer! It is important to know the ""exact"" name of the view - this is hardly challenged in any of the questions in this book.Overall, the questions in the book helped me answer about 25% of the exam. For the rest I had to rely on reading the actual manuals and experience. Phew, glad to get over it! Good luck!! Off to the next exam.."
3,"Not bad, but...","Overall, it's not a bad book. It covers some topics very well, but other topics are covered in reference-style. What's worse is that there are 3 or 4 topics not covered at all. There are some mistakes too, but the explained questions are good. Considering the fact that there are not many OCP DBA training materials, you should read this book and try to use it in combination with other OCP stuff."
4,Indeed a Good Cram Book,"This book as the name indicates is a good book to cram for the exam after you understand the material from other more detailed books and experience. It is very organized and to the point (the point being the exam). I suggest every one who wants to sit for the OCP exam should read it. If you have used the Cram book for the SQL & PL/SQL exam and was disappointed with it(like I was) you won't be disappointed with this one. The only thing that was missing from this book is NLS. There is no mention of the subject. However, there were three questions on my exam regarding this subject."
1,Bad book for exam preparation,"A lot of mistakes. Important commands like CREATE TABLE, are described only with a syntax diagram, like those in the Oracle documentation, and a very little description of each option. Save your money and print the Administrator's Guide from Oracle documentation."
4,really ver helpfull in DBA certification,this book gives the summarised view of all the DBA admintration and very helpfull for DBA certification and in real life.
1,nice story bad print,"this is a very good sci-fi story. you can google some reviews. i want comment on books quality only.the publisher used low contrast print for this deluxe hardcover... beautiful black and white pictures are now gray and white, the colored bonus pages are dull, the book looks like a 50 years old copy stored in high temperature.not exactly what i call ""deluxe"" hardcover.most of IDW books are great quality. i dunno what happened here."
1,waste of time,"First of all, no where on the cover does it say this is part 3 of a series. I didn't know that and was confused at who some of the characters were. Second, books should come with ratings like movies do. This one deserves an R rating. It is rather raunchy and foul.The ending is weak and predictable, the characters under-developed. The paranormal stuff made things worse. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Read the prequels first,"I didn't realize that this novel is a sequel to two others: Thicker Than Ice and Colder Than Ice. Since I read Maggie Shayne for the paranormal romance, not for mysteries, I hadn't read either of those and was, well, not completely lost, but quite confused at points. Shayne assumes that her readers know who Beth, Josh, Dawn and dead Mordecai are. Because of that assumption, she doesn't explain enough about them, how the protagonist Jax was associated with them, or what was wrong with Mordecai--until the end. The basic plotline is solid and interesting, and Shayne does create sympathy for her central couple: cop Cassandra ""Jax"" Jackson and former cop and convicted murderer/mental patient Michael ""River"" Corbett. Of course, from the beginning of the novel, it was rather obvious that the bad guy had to be one of two people. All in all, interesting, but I think I'd rate it higher if I had read the previous novels first."
3,Left me torn,"The story and suspense are good. Character development is good. The editing is poor and leaves a lot of really obvious and basic mistakes. As with the two other novels of Ms. Shayne's I've read, all the characters respond with a lot of sighing, licking their lips, slow blinks and slow head shakes. It's a whole lot of the same old thing, but manages to be compelling anyway. Once again, the love scenes seem to be cut and pasted from book to book. The sexual tension involved works well though.This was the third novel of Ms. Shayne's I've read and I will read one more. Thicker Than Water is the first installment of the Mordecai Young trilogy and I have to play catch up and go back to the beginning. After that, I believe I'm done with Ms. Shayne, but I thank her for the entertainment she provided me.Shelley Dawn, author of,Sweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
2,Academic: bla bla bla,"I bought this book hoping to get learn how to design a step up transformer ( a lower voltage to a higher one). The information in this book can be divided into two categories:1) things you already know 2) things that you are not interested inNo attempt is made to present material in an intuitive format. Another weakness of the book is that several fromulas are presented with variables that are neither defined or explained. If you are interested in building you're own transformers don't waste your money on this book. The only value it has is as a reference for few formulas. There is little practical, useful information if you are looking to construct a specialty transformer for a design project."
2,Not practical - very disappointing,"I've read through this book and I can's say I'm any closer to understanding how to design a transformer than when I started. There are very view practical examples. The text is vague on nearly every subject it discusses. There is no discussion on how how to select a core size, or transformers for switching power supplies. There is a lot of discussion about things no-one cares about such as procurement practice, and quality assurance."
3,HDBK of Transformer Design,"The book seems somewhat out-dated and lacks a complete mathematical approach, however, is has been a very useful text as a companion to other texts that I have on this and related subjects. When I first perused the book I was dissapointed in the seemingly lack of mathematical analysis, but on closer examination and actual use of the book, I have found it to be quite useful and would recommend it to those who not particularly interested in a highly rigorous text."
4,MTS LAB,Good amount of theory and practical construction data.Includes good thermal considerations.Includes high frequency inductors and transformers.Very useful as a reference for design.
1,Please Stop,"Someone please stop this woman from mass-producing such rubbish. All of her books are a waste of trees. It's not so much that she is a former Playboy bunny and stripper, it's that without any degree or training in child development, or any related field, she has no intelligent basis for her ""advice."" She needs to take a simple parenting class and go from there."
1,very dissapointing,"i am a card-carrying girlfiend ... loved iovine's previous books (i have all the guides from pregnancy to getting your grrove back and LOVE them all!). i really wanted to love this book.instead, it was a huge dissapointment. it had none of the chatty, witty dialougue or cute anecdotes that made iovine's earlier books fun to read, and so different from every other parenting book.this book read like a very tedious magazine article. the author occasionally tried to sprinkle in some vicki-like humor or language but it was sporatic, awkward and always fell painfully short. and as far as the content -- even the slightly experienced mom will find the ideas redundant."
2,Unsatisfying,"This is the first book I bought on my shiny new Kindle, and it was very disappointing. Can you say self absorbed? Because Mr Dyer certainly can't. The inane ramblings of a middle aged man. Well written ramblings, but ramblings none the less. I found myself switching over to reading Kant for an essay to save myself from the tedium."
1,Another burnout,"It's sad that Geoff Dyer admits his awareness of his sickness and, like so many addicts, glibly laughs it off as if he has nothing to do with the emptiness he keeps finding inside himself. How this book ever received great reviews anywhere is beyond me. I've received more interesting, humorous and intellectual letters from friends who travel - stoned and not. I did like the cover photo. Hope Geoff gets a grip and gets over himself someday. How many times can you call yourself an ""intellectual"" - who are you trying to convince? Burning Man in your 40's - please!"
2,"A collection of LiveJournal entries for lazy, smart adults","I read this book while I was in India, and I did not like it at all (the book, not the country). The author's tone made me feel angry. He sounded so lazy and boring. One of his stories in Paris talked about smoking marijuana on a date and walking around downtown. That was the crux of the story - he got stoned in Paris on a first date with a younger girl. That's cool if you are one of my college buddies, but not cool if you're a 40-something author who I paid good money to read."
5,A favorite!,This is one of my favorite books of all time. The story about Amsterdam is hilarious. I always try to read it aloud to friends but end up laughing so hard I can't read. DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!
4,Handy set of advice,"I like to say that this book helped me get through all those awkward teenage years. It has all sorts of been-there-done-that advise on everything from spirituality to dating to after-school jobs. Bytheway writes simply and forward, and it's a quick and handy reference guides for all the times advice is needed."
1,Very forgettable,"If you're looking for a good war story, this isn't it. One would expect a major publisher to come out with a somewhat serious and retrospective look at a flyer's personal remembrances of WWII. Instead, most of the stories have some connection to a sexual act; the author catches two superior officers in the 69 position; the author has sex with a partisan after he's shot down. Meanwhile, partisans force the author to shoot three Germans in cold blood, an act which barely gets a paragraph, and about which the author expresses no angst, regret, or other emotion. And, while this book totals 143 pages, every chapter ends with 4 blank pages before the next begins -- in truth there's less than 100 pages here...certainly not worth the price tag. If you must read it, wait for the paperback or even better, get it from the library like I did!"
2,Fiction sprinkled with a few facts,"Rochlin's ""Old Man and a Baseball Cap"" is just too outrageous to be taken as a work of non-fiction. The author says as much in an ambiguous last chapter that states(in a round-about way) that some of the information in the book may have never actually happened. While I don't challenge his record as an aviator in the war, I found the stories of detailed homosexual trysts between his Air Corps Colonel and another prominent pilot as well as his fantasy of a sexual encounter with his Uncle's wife to be questionable at the very least! Moreover, I profoundly disagree with the published reviews that found something profound in his decription of imaginary sexual escapades during the war. The guy wrote a lively and ribald piece of historical fiction - don't be confused."
1,a major letdown .,"I was prepared to like this book before I read it but it was a major letdown. I like the memoir form,WWII stories and anything having to do with flying but this one seemed unnecessarily crude, witless and the writing was sophomoric. I am surprised that a major publisher would put out something like this but even more surprised and saddened that some writers whose work I admire would blurb this book on the back cover. God knows what prompted them to do it...they couldn't have read it. This is a bad book and for the first time in a very long time I felt cheated. Usually, even with a bad book one can take away something but not from this one. I can't think of a single good thing to say about this book."
2,Rewrite this book and tell us the *real* story!,"The author is a funny guy and tells a riotous story. However, this book is a bit brash and irreverant for my taste. There are some things in life, such as friendship and death, that I find somewhat offensive to belittle with humor. There's a much more powerful story underneath the author's amusing anecdotes of his life during World War II. I'd love to hear the more serious side of his story. It's good of the author, even in the humorous way that he does, to share his war experiences with others who were not yet born at that time in history ."
1,Not really a war flying book.,"Liking war flying memoirs, I picked up this slender volume based in part on the jacket blurbs. I was really disappointed. Not much flying here and when you factor in the fact that the stories may not be true, then the whole thing just kind of lays there. I realize that this was a compilation of stage monologues, but really it was just poorly done. Maybe the printed word detracted from it. Anyway, this was a great chance to find out more about a really brutal air war in Italy and Yugoslavia, but instead it's a series of sexual escapades -- gay and hetero, so there's something for everyone -- loosely connected to the aviators. This could've been something worthwhile but instead it's shabby and not worth the time it took to read it. Maybe Fred did all that he claims and maybe it would have been better if he kept it to himself."
5,"Proud, profane - and absolutely genuine","Profane and proud, Fred Rochlin's told-late-in-life stories of his WWII experiences ring true and absolutely genuine. He makes no excuses for any of his youthful behavior as he makes good on his own personal mantra - before it's too late, ""tell your story."" This is a terrific little book that I read in just a few hours. Wish I coulda met this guy. Rochlin died of leukemia in 2002. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"
5,"A book to read, and reread a few times over.","I simply love this book. It's fantastic. The way it is writtten -in letters- makes this book exciting to read. The two heroines; Cecy and Kate, are witty and charming. They somehow find themselves sucked into a whirlwind of events that circles around an enchanted Chocolate pot.Needless to say, I really enjoyed this book, and think you would too. Therefore... read this book!"
5,"Magic and Chocolate, what more could you ask for?","*aMaZiNg* book!! I really loved this, and can't wait for the sequel (The Grand Tour). It's starts out kinda slow... seems boring and weird. But after the first few letters, you really get into the story!! The things that cousins Katherine Talgarth and Cecelia Rushton (aka Kate and Cecy) do, it's a surprise that they're allowed to do ANYTHING! Wish they explained more about living circumstances though, and what happened to both girls' mothers... but I loved the characters, especially Kate and Cecy (obviously) and Thomas and Sylvia!! This is a GREAT book; definitely read it!"
5,Simply the best,"This is simply the best Regency romance and the best fantasy book I've ever read. In spite of the fact that it is entirely in letter form, the action moves on briskly, and the two romances are excellent. If you get a chance, grab a copy and don't lend it to anyone or you won't get it back."
5,An Elusive book,"I first read S&C when I found it at the library. I reread it about a month later. It has since disappeared from the library-in fact the computers there claim it never existed! No, I am not the one who took it. But it is one of the few books I have contemplated buying from the library. This book is very hard to put down, and is great!"
4,Perfect on the beach summer read,"This is a great book - light, and better than anyromance novel. I couldn't wait to finish so I couldread it again."
2,Where's the plot????!!!!,"This short volume isn't worthy enough to be called a tale, book, or even a novel...it was so trite and simple. That this book came to be when two writers were writing joke letters back and forth greatly emphasises this books low reading and that it's an ideal book for simple minds. Where was the plot? Not in this book, that's for sure..."
3,Not to mention the original Ministry of Magic,"Before JK Rowling created her Ministry of Magic, before Suzanna Clarke created a Regency Era with magicians, Wrede and Stevermer did both.Written as an exchange of letters between cousins, Sorcery and Cecelia is typical Regency romance fare set amidst the London season with one cousin missing it all in the country... only add some intrigue plus a large dose of magic. It is entertaining, but there are problems. It reads like two completely different stories pushed together. And when you learn how it was written, that makes perfect sense. While some readers might like that aspect of it--essentially two parallel stories in one book-- I thought it detracted from the world the authors had created.That said, I still plan to read the sequel."
5,Hurrayyy! It's BACK!,"This is a delightful and ejoyable exchange of letters between two cousins, one at home in the country, and one in London for her first Season. The usual mix of gossip, family news, parties, and clothes included in these letters are spiced with magic."
4,What's not to love?,"Magic! Humor! Romance! The affair with the goat...?Jane Austen fans should enjoy this epistolary romp with cousins Kate and Cecelia, one on her first London ""season,"" the other wishing she was there. The only thing better would've been to see Cecy and Kate rampaging through polite society together. The romances between the girls and their respective love interests was fun and tantalizing against a backdrop of evil nemises and nefarious plots.The only complaint I have, and it isn't a huge one, is that the epistolary format tends to distance the reader from the action and emotion. The action is something that already happened, and the writer of the letter obviously came through it more or less in one piece. But again, this isn't enough of a problem to ruin the story.If you like fantasy, Regency romance and a light, fun read, you should enjoy this book."
4,Funny & Well written!,Very witty and clever. I can't even tell the two main characters were written separately by two different authors. The book is very cohesive and flows along smoothly.
5,Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Corespondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality,"My husband and I read this aloud to each other. It is very much in the style of Jane Austin but a series of letters between two cousins, one in the country at home and one having her London season. It read aloud easily and kept both of our interest throughout. I do highly recommend it to those who enjoy Jane Austin and fantasy. Very Good Fun."
4,magic and mayhem,"This is an epistolary novel between to cousins. I've never read an epistolary novel before and I had no idea it was one when I started reading! I was a bit weary at first but then began to enjoy what Kate and Cecy had to say to one another and how the plot continued to thicken! They're both strong female heroines and I love how they subconsciously fall in love! It's pretty hilarious...I mean, you know it's going to happen and with whom, but it's all about the journey!It's cute and romantic and there's even magic and mayhem!They wrote a couple of more sequels recently and am looking forward to them!"
4,Charming and fanciful,"This is a charming, fanciful tale of magic and intrigue, told through the correspondence of two young cousins, Cecelia and Kate. Soon after Kate leaves for a Season in London, both girls find themselves involved in a mystery concerning an enchanted chocolate pot. There is something about the writing style that I would almost describe as ""delicate."" It is a fun story in a magical alternate reality that the reader would almost like to step into."
3,Whimisical but overall boring,"I don't remember why I bought this book - maybe it was an Amazon promotion. The story is fairly predictable, except for the magic which is presented in a matter of fact way that I enjoyed. I think Cecy was much more interesting than Kate, which made me cranky when I had to read the Kate chapters. I don't know who the intended reader is supposed to be, except definitely female. Don't waste your money."
3,Nice Style,I really enjoyed the two writing styles of the letters back and forth. It really provided good character insight. The book kept my attention. It was whimsical and entertaining.
4,A Light and Funny Fantasy,"""Dearest Kate, It is dreadfully flat here since you have been gone, and it only makes it worse to imagine all the things I shall be missing.""Thus begins an enchanting fantasy story told in letters between two cousins, Kate and Cecilia. Many strange things are happening in London. Magical things. This was a great book, especially as I love Patricia Wrede's other books. And, the two authors wrote this as letters between each other, so they didn't really know where the book was going. They find out new developments as soon as their characters do. The two girls might fear for their lives- if they weren't having such fun! This is a wonderful lighthearted fantasy with a cute title too. And it also had a really whimsical and enjoyable writing style.*You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, [...]*"
4,interesting period piece,"Action-wise it is not in the league of Harry Potter, but for anyone who is also interested in atmosphere, and Old English Atmosphere, a highly recommended book"
1,I bought these and am very sorry that I did,"These DVDs are sold as a set when they could have put four or five episodes on a single DVD. They are cheesy and not very well done. Most of the time they are not actual footage -- when footage is available -- and they show cheesy less than cutting edge animation even when they could have shown the real thing. We bought all three sets, watched one and sent the other two back unopened to Amazon. Don't bother unless you have $89 a set to throw away. We are stuck with the opened set and don't have the heart to put it up for sale as we would feel like we are ripping the buyer off."
4,Author's reply,"There used to be a place for authors to respond to reviews by readers, and I am not sure what happened to that link. I responded to your queries, and did not go overboard with praise for my book. I can tell you that unlike the other authors we checked our facts out at our cost and time. You are being unfair in your comparisons, and it sounds as if you have a personal problem with the book.Again, our facts were checked out. Others were not. Had not Amazon taken that link, I would be able to respond as an author.Chei Mi Lane"
3,In answer to shang,This book has correct information. The others are full of errors.See their information on the Danger Man episode. Anna May Wong is not in that episode.Is there any information on radio appearances in the other books?You cannot compare a bio to a filmography. How much did you say it 'costed'?
5,Worth reading.,"This is an impressive collection of sermons that even someone who does not share the author's religious beliefs will find worthwhile to read. It provides an insightful view of the author's Christian beliefs far beyond the shallow fire and brimstone message that is too common with today's televangelists. Through the author's use of personal experiences I also learned a little about a remarkable individual named George W. Evans, Jr. I learned a lot about the application of a seemingly simple principal to our some times complicated lives. I think no matter what one believes it is beneficial to understand how this Christian believer approaches life and applies his religious beliefs. Highly recommended."
2,Descent,Diffucult to understand and the layout could be a lot better. To complicated needs to be simplified.
1,Not what I thought,"I was dissapointed in this product.While it had a ""slick"" look, the depth was lacking.It turned into a info-mercial for her business.Not what I was looking for."
5,Very pleased,I highly recommend this product to anyone who is ready to take responsibility for the life they create! Very uplifting and a joy to use.
2,Copy was not as expected,"What can I say, but that the words of Gone With the Wind will never change. So imagine my surprise that after ordering a copy of the book advertised with photos of a nice leatherbound version, I received instead a hideous and worn library edition, complete with barcode. Not pleased."
5,My favorite book,"Gone With the Wind is an amazing book. It is long, but there are very few truly dry moments in it. Some parts make you want to cry, some to laugh, and in a book written in the 30's I find that to be rare."
1,Very Disappointing,"Although this collection of photographs is very comprehensive, there is very little practical use for it. It does not opperate using Windows functions. It is not user-friendly. The manual doesn't provide any helpful insight. There is no text and the database is not searchable. Furthermore, its organization seems haphazard, i.e. Acer spp. images are disk #4? It appears as though a first year computer science student organized and wrote the program and I would have given him a D.Save yourself the money and buy his books, they are an excellent investment."
3,Not a bad gift,"It was a bit difficult getting the picture in, but the locket's appearance is simple yet elegant. I would look for something larger though."
4,Very Nice Product,"Very nice and exactly as described. Looks expensive. But beware, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get a picture into the locket portion of this locket. Took almost 2 hours and still doesn't fit exactly. They give you no room to wiggle or help"
3,"Great Pendant, But...",My wife LOVED it! This pendant was great for my wife and I was even thinking about getting one for my daughter for her birthday. But the clasp broke within 3 weeks and is not usable. I will be getting a little better chain with clasp that will hold a lot better than it did. But don't let this 'clasp' issue prevent you from buying one. The locket itself is really nice. Good product for the price.
1,very small,"if the purpose of this purchase is to put a picture in the locket (as I would assume anyone buying a locket is hoping to do) than you will need the ability to shrink to a very....very small size and really good vision in order to see once the picture is inserted into the locket via microscope and tweezers. in short, the locket is small"
4,Good Value,"The locket was exactly as promised. I was unable to have it engraved at our local jewelers, because they said being hollow inside, it might ""cave in"" during the pressure. I was able to find the wonderful world of computer engraving at ""Things Remembered"" at the mall, so it worked out beautifully.I can hardly wait for my great granddaughter to open it on Christmas morning."
2,don't buy it,"It's at the jewelers now getting engraved, but I don't think it's 3/4 inch in diameter and the chain is tacky looking. I would return it if my grand daughter's birthday wasn't so soon. Throwing good money after bad by having it engraved locally for $35.00 and buying another chain from another company."
2,Clasp on locket very poor,"People complain about the chain being poor quality, but I have had problems with the clasp for the locket. I even exchanged the first locket I bought (thank you Amazon for your wonderful return and exchange policy!) because the locket would not stay closed. Basically, there is just a flimsy tab of metal (or silver, I guess) that goes into a little hole on the other side of the locket. This system is either faulty or the metal is just poor quality because after opening the locket a couple of times it would not stay shut anymore. The metal tab had moved.As I said, I exchanged it for another one and I've basically had the same problem.The other reviews don't seem to mention this so maybe I've just been unlucky, but it really does seem like the product itself is just poor quality. Well, what do you expect for $40?"
5,Great Quality forthe money,"I gave this to my 16 year old daughter, and she loved it! I loved it too. It's made well. The chain is not flemsy. The heart locket is precious in an elegant way. Money well spent."
2,Poor quality,This looks like something you would buy in a .99 store. Cheap looking and weights less then 1 ounce. I returned it immediately. I would never give this to someone as a gift.
3,"18"" locket","The locket was to small so I returned it. It was a well made and very nice just to small. Still locking for a larger one that will hold a 1"" picture."
3,you get what you pay for,"Honestly there is nothing special about this pendant. If you're buying a heart locket for a special person, then save up and buy something nicer because this one isn't that great."
5,Looks nicer than expected...,"Yea this locket looks a lot nicer than I expected it to be. I'm soon gonna take some photos to kinkos to shrink them down to size, fit them in the locket and give it to my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. I'm sure shes gonna love it. You should buy this if you're looking for a nice gift for a loved one."
4,She loved it!,"Bought this for my Mom for Christmas, and put her grandson's picture in it. She loved it! The gift box was very nice."
4,granddaughter loved it,I bought this for my granddaughters 7th birthday. She loved it. My only complaint in the chain is very flimsy. The locket itself is very nice.
2,Great pot..except for lid,"Its a shame...a great porcelain covered iron pot with wonderful handles, but the lid (which is SO necessary in nabe cooking) DOES NOT FIT. I finally had my husband make me a new one....That is the only drawback of this item."
3,"Eh, get what you pay for",Cheap so I figured I'd throw it in with another order. Not as many points of articulation as I hoped for. Head tends to pop off very easily. Otherwise ok.
2,Disappointing Patchwork,I was somewat disappointed by this patchwork as it has no complete story at all. While the Moonbase and the Crusade offer Audio for the missing episodes there is no commentary so you are left to wonder what is happening in the silences.I expected more from the BBCThe episodes that are shown are captivating and do give an insight into the quality and occasional lack of quality that makes up Doctor Who.The Underwater Menace with its string transported Fish People and exaggerated evil madman was quite amusing.Yes the Show was great what a shame the DVD production is not.
4,"Good game, a little short.","This is a good game with a very interesting premise. The game play is good and the graphics are great. John is constantly talking to himself, which gets really annoying really fast; and the game is too short; I am not that good a player, and I beat it in just over 9 hours. But overall, this is a fun game."
4,"Highly recommended if you enjoy games, overall!","I liked this game a lot and that's saying something. I rented it on the PS2 and although I usually prefer the GameCube the controls for it on the PS2 are really nice to adapt to. <br /><br />This is one of those games that once you get bored with the main mission, you can run around just abusing your powers on things. It was one of the few to actually hold my attention for quite some time. <br /><br />The main character Vattic, is rather likeable and the story is somewhat intense.<br /><br />Downfalls were: <br /><br />Although I got stuck on a level, it seemed as if it were ending soon. <br /><br />Also, for some that have played FPS games plenty of time, you might be wishing for something more...<br />However, this isn't really a FPS, it just has some life of one. It is basically adventure."
5,One of the best GC games ever!,"This is an awesome game and 4 6 bucks u'd be an absoloute fool not 2 by this! stealth, squad combat, and even paranormal it has it all! Buy this game!"
2,Union Troops of the American Civil War (Europa Militaria) (Paperback),"Book was interesting but for the European market. The uniform, equipment and presentation authenticity was not up to American standards. For example a number of the horses used in the cavalry shots were multi-colored and breeds not common to the Civil War. Clearly the photos were of reenactments in Europe."
2,Nice but...,"Don't understand me wrong, I actually liked the book for the same reasons as the other reviewers but only up to a certain point. When the hero sodomized the heroine in a fit of jealousy and there were NO repercussions whatsoever the book lost it for me.Your choice if you like something like that, just be warned."
4,Pretty good (maybe 4.5 stars).,"As with the author's other two books, TRESPASS OF THE HEART and CHERISHED INVADER, I really liked SAVIOR IN TIME, but I cannot give it 5 stars. Ms. Gail always seems to introduce a subplot or character that never goes anywhere. In this book (since it travels back and forth in time) I can understand the changing sets of characters and plots, but it does get a little confusing.For example, there was a whole page put in about two little village girls who had absolutely no bearing on the story and made you think you had two more characters to keep up with. Don't get me wrong--I LIKED the book and DO recommend it. I just think the author has this idiosyncrasy in her books."
5,Words cannot describe it!,"I've got all of ASKA's CD's. I've seen them live countless times and I can't get enough of it. Everytime I listen to Avenger I hear something new, something I hadn't expected. ""Hail""! To ASKA! Keep Rockin' hard and steady! Can't wait for the next CD!"
3,"Glad I downloaded ""Crown of Thorns"" before buying the CD!","Ok...I know that I am starting to sound like a broken record. But, this is the 3rd time I have had to come in and correct reviews that may misleed the educated ear.Let's start with the composition. Lacks originality and is clearly piece-mealed from other metal bands like Priest, Maiden, Queensryche and Dio.Vocals? This guy cannot hold a candle to any of the veteran metal vocalists mentioned by the other reviewers.Please...if you want to hear the new generation of musicians/vocalists who are giving the veterans a run for their money, listen to the following; Spiral Architect, Magnitude 9, Jacob's Dream, Pain of Salvation, Labyrinth & Dali's Dilemma. Their are many others out there, however, these are a few to start with."
2,An error that cost me five hours,"On page 390, Figure 11.15 shows the order of blocks within an MPEG macroblock as Y Cr Cb. This is wrong; the correct order is Y Cb Cr. That error cost me five hours on a very time-critical project.That's not to say the book is completely useless. But that's a pretty serious error in a book that's supposed to help programmers."
5,Well-designed model. An ideal gift.,"Despite being a licenced set, this is still a throwback to the golden age of Lego space sets. In these days of simplistic designs, the Snowspeeder is refreshingly complex, and marvellous attention is paid to detail - from a distance you could almost swear you were looking at one of the real models used in 'Empire Strikes Back', and there's even a little computer screen showing an approaching AT-AT, so full marks for accuracy on all counts. By way of a cherry on the cake, this set comes with one of those little radar-dish guns used against the giant walking machines. Whether you're a Star Wars fan or not, this is well worth adding to any Lego collection."
3,Been There Done That,"The book gives a good overview of some of the more popular dive sites listing type of entry, depth & current information. It also rates the dives as Novice, Intermediate, or Advanced. The photography is good as are the dive descriptions. However, the book is dated and the map of the dive sites is not numbered correctly and doesn't list the names of many of the sites on the southwest beaches. Also, two of the most popular dive sites, the Town Pier & Salt Pier now have some restrictions on them that are not listed in this book. Overall, I think it's a good general overview of the sites and attractions of Bonaire."
2,Diving and Snorkeling Guide to Bonaire,"This guide is quite dated, whereby most information is no longer current. I'd recommend saving your money and purchasing the Dive Guide by Jack Jackson, unless you enjoy periodicals that are a decade+ old. In its day, I'm sure it was adequate..."
5,A real Heart Felt book about Cuban Family Life,A must read for any Cuban who came to this country after the revolution started in Cuba or anyone who has had difficult strugles in life and wants to remmeber the good things and the things that were really important during all the caios. Can't wait to see what this author come out with next!
5,"A Magnificent Treasure FILLED with Precious, Sacred Thoughts of Family and Family Life","This book has so many profound and inpiring truths in it. This book is certainly one of the best I have found. It has helped me to remember many of my own family qualities. It has also helped me to let go of a lot of old grudge patterns toward some family members.The books offers outstanding tools for all kinds of people, including: people looking to experience God in their life; people who want to remember their family's good qualities, people who are looking for ways to forgive other family members and themselves; people seeking to develop inner peace, joy and gain clarity; on family issues and much more.Cuba, I Remember You/Cuba, te recuerdo: A magnificent treasure FILLED with precious, sacred thoughts of family and family life. I strongly recommend this book."
1,Don't bother buying this book,"I am a high-tech marketing manager and an adjunct professor. From both the real-world business side as well as the academic side, I found this book to have little value. It spends page after page on general issues regarding Internet Marketing, and never gets to anything that could be used or implemented in the business world. Topics are explained without giving specific details as to how to implement the Internet Marketing idea. A very specific example is a description of viral marketing which the author refers to as ""Creating a Wave."" The short section goes on to say that free media, publicity and word of mouth are important. Of course they are. But how do you get them? I feel sorry for the students that are required to purchase this book. I guess they'll have to learn Internet Marketing on the job. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this book used instead of the $90+ list price."
2,Outdated,"Well intentioned, and a good overview.... for 1999. The web and the world have changed substantially since the book was published."
3,A second edition is urgently needed,I used the first edition in one of my e-commerce courses. While the book migth still deserve 3 stars it is very much dated and my students had to do much additional research in the net to round most of the topics.
2,"Great product, but can't see the display too well","This is a great item, but they put a black grid into the screen. This grid makes it impossible to read the display at night unless you are less than a foot away and directly at eye level. This was so irritating I returned the product back to Amazon. The alarm clock feature had no volume control. This was also very annoying. So sad since everything else was so perfect."
1,a complete waste of videotape,"blurry HORRIBLE amateur video quality of anonymous minor league footage, (don't expect any actual NHL action here) intelligence-insulting narration, terrible 'hijinx' music, you can tell this company (if it still exists) made it to try and make a couple of fly-by-night bucks at Amazon's expense. The footage is incredibly inane, with clips that do the forward-reverse-forward-reverse-forward thing WAY past the point of you getting sick of it. Like, ""can we fill the spaces on the tape up where we have no actual entertainment"" while the anonymous narrator repeats moronic phrases like, ""do you believe these guys?"" I'm not kidding when I say it makes 'America's funniest home videos' look like Emmy material. Use this video to record over if you're stuck for blank tape. Oh, also, any ""blooper"" tape made by this same company, there's another under the title of ""fights and bloopers,"" same thing. It's awful."
1,Awful,"Nothing more than a random series of videotaped replays of shots and plays covered by a cheesy soundtrack. Not specifically ""bloopers,"" it is merely a string of video lowlights from minor league hockey. Poor quality tape. Completely worthless."
2,Not worth the price.,"These cards are not terrible. They do have pictures that are bright and easy for children to recognize, but the part that actually shows them how their mouth is supposed to move does not really work that well. Which is fine, my son learns it all better by watching my mouth anyway, but then why spend the extra money on flash cards with the mouth? You can teach your child the mouth movements just as well,( if not better), with a cheaper set of flash cards,( you can even find them at the dollar store). It is just not worth the money to buy these special ones"
2,Get it from the library...,"There are a few, very roughly sketched ideas in this book that might be helpful, though most of it is fluff, as another reviewer pointed out. One of the ideas that is helpful is to measure your marketing efforts: You want to know what works and what doesn't! However, this isn't as easy as Sugars makes it sound because most people don't remember how they heard of a business (unless they actually looked for it). This is especially the case with advertising, one of the method that Sugars recommends...While his list of strategies can provide some ideas, they are outlined at such a high-level, they're almost useless unless you already have some marketing sense.So, get the book from the library to get your idea-juices flowing. It's a quick read (it's high-level, after all) and you might find a few useful nuggets."
5,Small changes to make Huge Profits...,Blown away by the busines chassis concept... and how small changes in the chassis parts can make a huge difference to the bottom-line... Simple tips to make those changes...A must read...
1,oldpilot,"Brad Sugars hypes himself as a business guru. His books are mostly simplistic generalities with some sound principles ""lifted"" from other writers. Mr. Sugars has conducted ""market research"" from leading writers such as: Anthony Robbins, Tad James, Brian Tracy et al. If you have read any of these authors you will find that Brad simply has regurgitated their material. Don't waste your money on his books or the consulting services he is really trying to promote."
2,Limited value,"This book has three short chapters on theory which are reasonably good. The parable-like stories in Chapter 3 are probably my favorites. Then there are 282 ideas on 150 pages--the bulk of the book. Then six very short and almost useless chapters including one on how you can contact the author to get consulting help.The ideas are ""fluffy""... for each one that I thought was good there are several (even dozens) that were silly, commen-sense, illegal (you cannot legally trade comp time for overtime for non-exempt position in the US), or otherwise unusable.So the ultimate value of this book is how to make a lot of money writing some very thin material and a monument to Sugars' salesmanship."
5,You can't be in business without this book,I have recommended this book to all my clients. It is full of great ideas for businesses to implement. It gets you thinking outside the box. Every business owner should have this book.
3,Not much new here - just a quick rehash of his marketing advice,I was disappointed - from the title I thought there would be advice on managing cash flow and instead it's the same advice on increasing sales. Just read the Business Coach book instead.
5,Is your business strapped for cash?,"Instant Cashflow outlines specific methods that entrepreneurs can use to achieve business success, focusing primarily on Sugars' innovative marketing and sales strategies. In his conversational, matter-of-fact tone, Sugars explains how entrepreneurs of any level can implement his sales and marketing strategies to dramatically increase their company's cashflow.You are able to follow any of the ""282 Tips to Make it Happen"" in order to turn your business into a mechanism that allows you to live the type of life you always dreamt of living.Instant Cashflow doesn't just teach professionals how to succeed; it redefines success and puts it within the reach of global small business owners.This book is a must read for any business owner."
2,lame,"Very entry level lame information in this book. If you just dug yourself out of a cave, you might find this book full of useful information for you."
2,A disappointing tribute to Jacob Do Bandolim,As with so many musical tributes no matter how well meaning this one leaves very much to be desired. The Mandolin (Bandolim)parts manage to get out the melody but without the fantastic flourishes and technique and artistry that Jacob is so revered for. If you like the Choro style of music and the Jacob Do Bandolim style of playing I would point you to Ronaldo Do Bandolim who is still active as far as I know and has made some very fine recordings and television appearances of which you can see some on You tube to get an idea of how Ronaldo carries on Jacob's tradition of incredibly adept Bandolim playing. If you just want to immerse yourself in the master Jacob then try to find copies of the two Acoustic Disc CDs that are US reissues of some of Jacob Do Bandolim's South American LPs. Amazon has them as either downloads or used CDs by various sellers. You will not be disappointed.
1,Not a good recording.,I was not happy with this recording because it did not sound like Jacob do Bandolim. The art-work was also disappointing.
4,Great set of movies plot line could have been better,Thes are great movies and I am glad they put them together in a collection. Although some of the plot lines and ending could have been better. I wont disclose info but overall I was happy with this purchase
2,Remember the 70's?,"Now that we have HD, the analog feature films look so fuzzy. But for the price, they provide a good scare for adults. NOT for children."
3,Good Ol Black,Yeah DC is doin it wit thes Top Flight dudes. They be handling they business on this album. Wit guest vocals by my man Ivan T helps alot. The 1st song is what got me on the bammas from the start. They flow fast like Doe or Die wit them same pimp-like beats which is real tight.
2,Great Show...Poor DVD,"I am a ""One Step Beyond"" fan for sure, but I was disappointed by this release. There are 12 episodes on a two-sided disc, but the quality of the DVD content is poor. The source material appears to be transferred from an old VHS tape. The opening and closing credits are incomplete as well. In the middle of the ending credits, it pauses and jumps to the next episode. True classic television purists will find this unacceptable. However, the Miracle Pictures release of ""The Veil"" is not like this."
1,These DVDs are barely viewable,These DVDs are absolutely terrible! I can't believe they are being sold with such poor quality. I can barely see the picture or make out images. Disgraceful!!
4,similar to Unsolved Mysteries,This program reminds me of Unsolved Mysteries which aired two or three decades later and was a documentary with a narrator speaking to the viewer and showing them pictures. This program takes unsolved mysteries of the early 1900s and adds fictional filler to make a dramatization of what the characters might have done. I am giving it four stars because the script writing is not as good as in Twilight Zone.
1,Not as Advertised!,"Picture is very deceiving. You only receive ONE strainer, NOT three, as the picture and the word ""strainers"" clearly implies. The strainer is very poor quality. Would not purchase from this company again."
4,This is an OVAL mirror,"Looked more rounded to me on the pix, but oh well. OMG one would think there are tons of choices on such a simple item but I looked over a day and can't find a lighted one, which I would prefer, to match my requirement: Well lit, but running battery powered LED (no hot regular bulbs on my face), no there is none. The well-lit ones have to be plugged into the wall, limiting its portability and adding clutter in your bathroom. I also wanted a MANLY one, seems most mirrors are made for women? Hey men too want to look at our best. I would had also prefer a 10x, but after a full day enough was enough and I settled on this 7x, at least it's thin enough to sit on my narrow shelf."
3,I returned it,"I'm afraid this didn't stay with me long. I was expecting an actual steamer. I'm sure this would have steamed crab legs and other seafood brilliantly, but I do not live on the coast and therefore don't cook a lot of seafood. Then I imagined that I could use it for a pasta cooker, but I don't want to have a lot of ""one hit wonder"" kitchen tools in my very small kitchen. So, overall, nice product, but wasn't what I was expecting, which was a vegetable steamer that's not plastic and doesn't have to be plugged up."
5,What a GREAT beginning!,Fans will understand. The beginning had the the flavor of the show we have loved for 48 years. Mint condition jewel!!
5,"William Hartnell One of THE Best Dr. Who ""Examples""","No matter which Actor you most-closely associate with Dr. Who, William Hartnell is certainly one you should take a look at. Episodes from this period are truly sparse & give viewers who discovered Dr. Who far later, and excellent historical perspective. Not to mention the Daleks!"
2,no good even for a hardcore fan,"I love Hartnell. I own 8 other dvds that are first Doctor, but this one was very disapointing. The special features were no good not to mention that you only get fragments of a few episodes. As much as I love Doctor Who I couldn't get into it."
2,Disappointing patchwork,I was somewat disappointed by this patchwork as it has no complete story at all. While the Moonbase and the Crusade offer Audio for the missing episodes there is no commentary so you are left to wonder what is happening in the silences.I expected more from the BBCThe episodes that are shown are captivating and do give an insight into the quality and occasional lack of quality that makes up Doctor Who.The Underwater Menace with its string transported Fish People and exaggerated evil madman was quite amusing.Yes the Show was great what a shame the DVD production is not.
3,Not the best Dirk Pitt book!,"I am a fan of Clive Cussler and the Dirk Pitt series written by him only. ""Night Probe"" was good, but this book is really boring compared to his others. Dirk was hardly in the novel. JMC"
2,Weakest of the Pitt Novels,"I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest. It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways....."
5,Excellent!,"This was a most fascinating book! From page 1 until the end, Clive Cussler keeps you turning those pages - I could not put this book down and read it in 3 days. Every chapter ending pushed you right into the next until you just could not keep your eyes open anymore or you experienced double vision from constant reading! Clive Cussler takes you into Dirk Pitt's world and doesn't let go! A must read for the fiction addicted!"
4,Pitt & Giordiano,"Still reading this novel, but it is still enthralling like all of Cussler's books.I now have all off Clive cussler's books, a pity that at this point of time that there are no more"
4,best if read with the entier series,"Cussler's writing style realy establishes it's self well. From involving a historical mystery to a political struggle, he is the master. I would suggest reading it with all the other novels in the series."
3,A little too weird for me,"Night Probe! by Clive Cussler is a Dirk Pitt novel that was a very readable story. However the book was just a little too weird for me. The storyline involved several conspiracies that were just not plausable.The story involves Dirk Pitt looking for the North American Treaty. Only 3 copies existed in the world and they were lost. One on a sunken ship, one on a missing train and one that was destroyed. Dirk Pitt must find this treaty in this book.To make matters a little more interesting this treaty sold Canada to the US.The book is a nice relaxing novel to read, but certainly not Cussler's best."
1,Worst of Cussler's Work,"Can't believe that Dirk Pitt lets off a former lady love who betrays her country for the sake of her love with Pitt's British spy adversary. As a Naval officer, her inability to keep her mouth shut while in the sack with the Brit spy should have been grounds for a court martial for treason. Totally wrecks the story for me. I tossed the book when I was done."
3,"Entertaining read, but lacking typical Cussler action","Dirk Pitt fans will enjoy this adventure even though their hero is a bit more bookish and reflective than he typically is in other adventures. The book could have benefited from a little more Al Giordino.Cussler's use of a naval officer's historical research as part of her doctoral program to provide some backstory information was well done (but she was a friend of Dirk's). Learning the importance of the North American Treaty and the implications it could have for a long-hatched plot between Canadian and American politicians through this mechanism seemed to work even though it seems a stretch. Cussler made us believe it.The primary disappointment was the lack of action in this book compared to previous Cussler works. I enjoyed it and it's still worth reading, but be prepared for a different Cussler experience than you typically find."
3,Night Probe was ok,I thought that this book was a little dragged out in parts. Also in several parts of the book the events jumped around more than usual to the point of being confusing.
3,Dirk Pitt saves North America,"Once again, Clive Cussler has re-written history and predicted a future that has not happened. The major issue is the fate of Canada, when a secret treaty from Woodrow Wilson is discovered. Dirk must find the actual treaty before some of the other nations' best spies find it. Political intrigue abounds as English and French speaking Canadians work behind the scenes. Sometimes its hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Indeed, when the Canadian Prime Minister's wife has her climatic scene, I was surprised at who was behind the manipulations. I was also dissappointed in the US President's actions."
5,"Oh, North America! My home and native land!","Ok while the basis of this North America Treaty (spoiler------>) of the United States being ""sold"" Canada by the United Kingdom (not quite sure that's possible since Canada was not really a ""colony"" per se, it was long since federated by 1914) was a little far-fetched, it was still a good and amusing novel. Good intrigue with the Russians (the Russians supporting a communist inspired secession movement in Quebec at the time to gain a toe hold in North America and break up America's biggest trade partner is probably a little more plausible), however, even if the spy Britain sends to bust up the party is a bit too much like James Bond. I still give Night Probe 5 stars. Not as good as ""Atlantis Found"" but still a good one."
4,Review on 3 libras,"This cd-single import of the song 3 Libras by A Perfect Cirlce is very good. 1 because 3 libras is one of my favorite songs by them and 2 because the band has great talent. Now this cd is nto as good as the complete album Mer De Noms, but it is good. Manyard has really came through with his new band, and I hope ths was just not a little side project of his, I hope A Perfect Circle makes another album and I hope he still keeps going with TOOL, and I can't wait until the new album hits the shelves later this spring. Overall this is a good cd by the band and anyone who enjoys listening to them, TOOL, Deftones, Incubus, Soulfly, or any other bands in that category of music and wants to hear rare songs by A Perfect Cirlce, should go pick it up"
2,Fair Read,I got bogged down in this one. It wasn't the best read in the world for me.That's why I rate it just fair
5,"If you can sit on the sofa, you can get fit with this book!","I am not even a TV addict, but I figured if someone can get fit during commercials I could certainly spend the same time using the same techniques from this book! For those of us who can't bear to think of a 20 minute walk or the drive to the YMCA, this book gives easy to maintain, achievable exercises. Well written, easy to understand and follow, and fun to boot!! This one is a winner!Here's to more commercials and less flab!"
1,Not Good,"I suppose if you already know the everyday verbs like to be, to listen, to make, to go etc and now want to know the French for verbs like to purr (as in a cat) then this book is for you. Otherwise it is completely useless! It is also a bit misleading to call it flashcards when it is in fact a book and so very hard to use as flashcards. If you can buy something else"
5,Oh Wonder,The Hank Dogs sre special. I don't want to be specific about any particular song or melody. The voices are charmed. The songs are simple and compelling. Half Smile is as fine as BareBack.
4,Neal & Carlos,"This disc as a whole is average, but Fire at Night features Carlos Santana and Neal Schon dueling guitar solo's. This one song makes the this CD priceless."
1,Disappointed,"I usually don't do reviews but I felt the need to do this when I got the invite from amazon.... I must say that I am disappointed with this album...Gregg's work with Santana was great as was his work on his solo ""roots' from 2001 and Abraxas Pool but ""gringo"" to me didn't do it!!.. It was very ""80's"" sounding with no real ""solid"" beats.. it all sounded ""mushy"".. I was expecting ""latin rock"" but this doesn't have it!!"
3,rolie,This CD is ok. His newer stuff is alot better. Has the fake drums witch I really don't care for.
3,"""Gregg Rolie"" part II","(read my review of ""Gregg Rolie"") ""Gringo"" picks up where his first solo album left off. It is truly a product of the 80's of which I am not a huge fan. That said, it IS well produced, well thought out, and supported by top-shelf muscians. If you like a lot of the music that came out during that period then I believe ""Gringo"" is an album well worth owning. In spite of my distaste for the era's genre I still find myself re-playing this and ""Gregg Rolie"" several times over; ah well....."
4,Beautiful little charm!,"I received this little charm today and immediately put in on a chain to wear in honor of my beautiful little granddaughter. It is a lovely little piece. My only regret is that it is a little thinner than expected. Overall, it is very nice and I am very happy that I ordered it."
5,Beautiful!,"I received this the other day, and while I haven't yet baked in it (hope to do this soon), I have to say that this is one very beautiful piece of stoneware. It will look gorgeous on the table, and I look forward to many years of use baking not only pies but quiches and tarts. A gorgeous addition to my cookware collection!"
2,Mainly porno,"I read this on the recommendation of an aquaintance. The author's idea is to explore what might happen if everyone's sexual inhibitions were eliminated by ""the gas"". I didn't find it very interesting. Mostly it's just porno. I wasn't offended, just bored. Platt has matured since he wrote this - his later stuff is much better."
4,Read at Your Own Risk,"Incredibly perverse, absurd and blackly funny at times. There's something to offend everyone here, though whether a book filled with scathing, over-the-top social commentary is reducible to ""porno"" is another issue. Honestly, I'm happy that such works occasionally test the boundaries of free speech (U.K. fails, U.S. passes). The wild reactions in reviews of this book are explained in a quote from Octavio Paz,""I don't believe that there are dangerous writers: the danger of certain books is not in the books themselves but in the passions of their readers."" There is much that is disturbing in The Gas, as can be seen from some of the troubled and disingenuous reviews here. This is a book that pushes the outer limits. It's my understanding that its author won't comment on this book."
3,Ok,Not really what I needed but I think with a larger tank it would work better. I have a 20 gallon so this was a miss for me.
2,Gravel cleaner,"I noticed I bought a lot of Marina product lately. I guess it's cheaper than most brand. Oh well, you get what you paid. I can't say anything nice about this brand. Poorly designed and cheaply built."
2,Not easy!,"I should have listened to the other reviews complaining about the lack of power.What it really boils down to (IMO) is that the valve is poorly designed. It relies on the grate to be perfectly tight in order to prevent backflow. Gotta check that grate before every water change!! Even when the valve is working, it is very difficult to start via any of the three common methods.Another major flaw is the lack of an angle at the input end. I find there is no effective suction until the entire oval is pressed against the gravel surface, which is difficult when there is no angle.Lastly, the large diameter hose pulls water way too quickly. The combination of no angle with large hose turns this is a rapid siphon. This leaves me rushing to clean what I can before the bucket is full.Perhaps I got spoiled with my old Fluval vac, but its smaller hose gave me plenty of time to dig around and loosen detris. Too bad they don't make a longer one. My hunt for a good 24"" gravel vac continues."
2,either this thing is too hard to work or i'm an idiot,I can't get it to work. I got a trickle going out once and the only reason my gravel looked cleaner was because it got so stirred about. directions were so vague but in many languages. i even watched youtube videos!
4,I wish I liked it more,"All the gravel cleaners I have ever used have had a little of a learning curve and this one is no different. So far whenever I try to use it, I have had to slosh around a significant amount of water. I am hoping that as I become more proficient with using it, I will get a little less wet when I attempt to clean my tank. Overall, the price was good and the product arrived very quickly. The product itself is rather large, so cleaning a larger tank can go much quicker with this item."
2,Doesn't work,I don't know if I m doing anything wrong but this really doesn't work as I hoped. Got some nasty fish water in my mouth trying to get the flow going
1,"Terrible, terrible product.","I had high hopes for this gravel vac...however, it fails miserably.I have a 55 gallon aquarium, and this vac does not generate nearly enough suction to adequately clean it. There isn't even enough suction to lift the feces from the gravel to the top of the wand.My water changes now take twice as long due to the low flow of the vac, and the gravel remains full of stool.This will be going into the trashcan where it belongs."
3,Basically Still True,I am a professor. I have students who want to be professors. They need to read this book.
5,A GREAT book for any NASCAR race-fan!,"This book was a nice change from the typical ""behind the scenes"" books you usually find about Nascar. The author tells it like it is from a fan's point of view. He describes his trips to several different NASCAR events. His stories are amusing, and entertaining, and his information is accurate. I used this book to show a friend of mine why I go to so many races and why I am such a big NASCAR fan. Next thing you know, she was begging me to take her to Rockingham,NC. She's a NASCAR fan now too, so I guess that says something for the book. I highly recommend it to any true NASCAR fan or anyone who doesn't understand why NASCAR is America's fastest growing sport. Read ""Fixin' to git"" and just maybe you'll become a fan too......"
3,stereo bluetooth?,"The connection to the headset with the mobile phone was great, even when the battery was dying the MP3 player sound only went down, never lost a connection. The battery lasts for about 2 hours. The sound is just an even tone, I would hardly call it a stereo headset. phone calls are great they sound decent & all the features on the headset work. For music, NO...For a wireless phone, Yes."
2,Poaching cups are not replaceable??,"I've had this pan for about six months, but the cups which have never been ""non-stick"" are scratched and our eggs are infiltrated with pieces of the egg cups coating. I emailed Fagor to try to get replacement cups since the pan itself is in great shape. They DON'T sell replacement cups! I cannot believe it really. I'm sending the pan to Goodwill and buying a Calphalon. $31.99 for a pan that lasts for six months is too much."
5,Wonderful Poacher,Works like a charm. Well made. High quality. I purchased a cheaper one before this and it simply didn't last. This one will.
1,Horrible Egg Pocher,"I just got the update on this xmass present gift. This product is a waste.... I am finding it hard to believe that 19 other people gave this product ""5"" stars. I am sure that they are sending out different models or versions. The version that was sent on my behalf is a piece of junk. I am told by the recepient that the egg(s) sticks to the sides & the telfon is useless....even after sprying oil/pam in the cups. Would not purchase this item again!"
5,Great Product!,I finally found the WINNER! As have most people I spent a great deal of time looking for and purchasing various egg poachers. My search has ended.
5,Great tailoring ideas,"Have purchased two more copied, one for each of my daughters. There is no other book I've found that so easily explains how to proceed, and why, when it comes to couture approaches to making great, tailored garments! The illustrations and manner in which Zapp explains things is so simple and easy to follow. She read my questions and answered them!"
3,Not exactly a method,"This book has a lot of good information about sewing tailored garments for women. However, the title suggests that there is some unique ""method"" to be revealed in the text. It was disappointing to find that this was not the case. Really, it's more like reading a series of somewhat related articles by a knowledgeable tailor. The technical information is good, but it might be hard for a complete beginner to find what they need here. On the other hand, very experienced women's tailors or dressmakers will have already learned most of this, or will probably own other reference books that cover the same ground. Perhaps the best use for this book would be for intermediate level home sewers who want to expand their skills in making structured women's wear."
5,One of my favorites from childhood,"This book was a gift to me when I turned 5 years old and began loosing things. I lost my tooth, lost my shoes, lost lots of stuff; I could really identify with Lucy. I was so very happy to find this book on Amazon for my own daughter and the grandchildren of my heart. I loved Eloise, but Lucy's life and problems were much more like my own."
5,A Miraculous Accident,"This is a recording of the one and only time Kleiber conducted this symphony. Kleiber's son asked a friend to tape the performance on a little cassette recorder. He also knew that every performance was recorded by the orchestra. Well, the orchestra recording disintegrated in storage and if it weren't for the friend's cassette we would never hear this absolutely spectacular performance. A brilliant engineer cleaned up the sound and although a bit below modern standards one doesn't care. The sense of being out in the open country is palpable and the audience was so mesmerized that they didn't clap when it was over. Kleiber had to have the orchestra stand up to indicate the end. Then there is almost 4 minutes of pandemonium from the audience. Add this to your collection. Sometimes I think Kleiber is Beethoven!"
4,Kleiber conducted on the safe side,"This cd was sourced from taped live recording. It was played fast compared to its competitors, in particular in the first movement. According to liner notes, Kleiber thought this work should be played at brisk. The sound quality is actually pretty good. I picked it up in local music store for $5.99. I could not imagine why amazon marketplace is so outrageous while you can purchase it from UK for $12.99. Be aware, this CD cannot be played on computer."
2,Here it's a miss. - 3/4 Beethoven,"Normally, I love Carlos Kleiber. But here he does not take the repeats and his pace is, ah, rapid. So rather than a stroll through the countryside, poor Beethoven is trotted along. Your heart bleeds for him by the end. You worry about his health. You think, oh this can't be good. Heart attack any moment? Why are they abusing the man? Stop for a breath! No repeats are taken. No one is allowed to enjoy the view. No. Only between the movements when some souls dare to clap. Is it over? Is it bow time, was it really that short? On to the next run, the next lap.Listening to the end, the audience doesn't know what to think. Did he end it? Did he chop it up, was this Beethoven? Oh, Carlos, what were you thinking?And no cheers for Orfeo. An abbreviated 6th and that is it on a full price disk? Grrrr."
2,Poor recording of an eccentric interpretation,"This recording sounds like it was taped before WWII, although it is only a decade or so old. The tempis are too fast, the playing unprecise. An eccentric approach which misses so many points. Not recommended. The Beethoven ""Gold Standard"" is still Karajan (1962 as well as 1977) with the Berliners, or, if you will, Abbado with the Berliners."
5,Well Satisfied,"This clock is quite a bargain! Looks like a more expensive clock, easy to set up, does what it is supposed to do and looks great in a kitchen-dining area. Especially with other copper pieces in the room."
3,Chaney clock,"We got this item for work because our other clock broke. Even though all of us in the office have the time on our computers, we really missed the old wall clock. When the clock arrived, we didn't care what it looked like. It worked, and it is still working. The only problem with it is that when it arrived, the plastic was all scratched up. We had missed having a clock up on the wall so much that we didn't care about the scratches."
1,Horowitz or Horror Wits?,"I want to try and keep this simple. Somewhere over the last several years, Mr. Horowitz lost his literary skills. He is now just a shill for the right, the extreme right, which is fine, but if you're going to be an author, a little research and editing might be in order.A very poorly written book that should have been reduced to an essay."
1,What???,"I am a member of the far left and the thesis of this book is extremely offensive to me. Why did the left abandon the War on Terror? The very notion confuses me. The left perceives Bush as abandoning the War on Terror, diverting resources from the fight against Al-Qaeda to randomly go off and fight Al-Qaeda's enemy, Saddam Hussein. I have never met anyone on the left that thinks that America is wholly evil. I recognize the rare individual freedoms this country provides, but that does not mean that we should not criticize foreign policy misadventures that make the rest of the world hate us and give terrorists grounds for better recruiting. It is a tired and childish criticism that because the left criticizes US foreign policy that the left necessarily hates America."
1,Presidential Campaign Propaganda,"Once again, I made the mistake of buying a ""political"" book during the final months of a presidential campaign.When you start reading the book, it looks like it might give a thoughtful analysis of the subject. The further one goes along, the more it simply becomes election time propaganda. This derates whatever good points there might have been in the first part of the book.Do not read it, a waste of time!"
5,History revisited,"One of most valuable -- and disturbing -- insights in Unholy Alliance is just how closely the contemporary left's anti-Americanism resembles their anti-anti-communism of the sixties. Pure Marxist/Leninism may be dead but, the poisonous residue it left in the minds of adherents ( consisting mostly of a childish, Rousseauan primitivism that romanticizes the non-existant virtues of the as-yet-unspoiled-by-capitalism ""noble savages"" in the third world) has, as Horowitz makes clear, completely warped their moral faculties.This is an important book.--Craig Maxwell"
5,Horowitz knows and tells the truth,"David Horowitz' new book, Unholy Alliance, clearly explains the nexus between the Left and the radical extremist elements in the middle east and around the world. Although disturbing, this book speaks the truth. I never realized that Horowitz who is now a conservative, was a member of the radical left for many years. Thus he has first hand knowledge of how the Left operates and why they have alligned themselves with those we are now at war with."
5,DAVID HOROWITZ IS A GENIUS,"David Horowitz knows the LEFT Intimately cause his parents were communists and he, too, a radical leftist during the 60s. But he SAW THE LIGHT and every since then has written in-dept books about the LEFT and how they view the world in general. He is right on about how the left mollycoddles and emboldens the enemy; always have, always will. Proof is in the pudding: Arafat and other terrorists endorse Kerry as do most muslims all over the world. This is a must read for every American."
1,Mindless Drivel from a hateful man,"Save your money. This is more mindless hate speech from a pseudo-academic, pretending to even know what the truth is or to even care."
1,trash,"this book was wrote by a right wing neophite who in his insanity, portrait any person that oposse the actual administration as anti-american or traitor.what's next? concentration camps and massive deportation of the un-american?"
5,A real eye opener,This is a crucial book for those who want to understand what is happening in our nation and world.I have always wondered why our leftist and news media parroted Islamic terrorist propaganda. I had not noticed that the USSR had been teaching and supporting terrorist groups for decades. I assumed their ideologies would conflict.This is a crucial book for understanding how these two ideologies have united in their common goals of world domination to distroy on their common enemy the USA.
2,"Denunciation, Not Analysis","A poor effort, by a man capable of insightful analysis. I read this after reading ""Hating Whitey"", the first 2/3 of which I found compelling and informative. This book is a pure denunciation of the supposedly monolithic Left. I expected a book about the dangers of radical Islam, but half way into the book very little had been said on the title topic. Horowitz loves to use the word screed to refer to Leftist writings, and this word lept to mind continually as I read. Not a book for the open-minded thinker, but for the ""in the trenches"" mudslinger!"
5,Great tome. Intellectually honest.,"From the outset, David Horowitz' book makes the case, aligning the left with radical islamofascism. I found this book to be a great read and it's main premise seems to be constantly bouyed by world events from current declarations by Vladimir Putin to support for Kerry by the world's foremost terrorist. I highly recommend this book for those not afraid of the truth."
5,Kill the Jews!,"""Write"" on the mark. If anyone has any doubt as to the validity of assertions behind ""Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left"", they should have been with me on the University of Michigan's campus for the Palestine Solidarity Movement conference, when the crowd of Islamic students and African-American faculty cheering them on, broke into a lathered screaming mantra of ""Kill the Jews! Kill the Jews! Kill the Jews!"" I honest-to-God thought I was back in Algeria or Chad in the 1970s. To this day, the heavily African-American steered University of Michigan faculty has refused to apologize for the conduct of students and faculty screaming for genocide at the Palestine Solidarity Movement conference. Read this book! It'll convince you of David's hypothesis more than I can with this single anecdotal reference. Besides, any book the left loathes this much, has got to be pretty important stuff."
5,Great,A very well written book. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the other side of the religion of peace and the ties to liberal Americans. This book is a great expression of the 1st amendment & free speech everywhere.
2,Deeply Disappointed,"I read his very well-written autobiography last summer, and was highly impressed with his erudition and reasonableness. Thinking he's an interesting writer, it is a quite shocking letdown to see this book even in print; it should have stayed as a thought in his head. Perhaps I was taken in by what may actually have been an act, a cleverly designed portrayal of a critically minded man with an intellectual journey but, in actuality, the same ideologue he was when he helped flack for Stalinist Russia. Maybe, and maybe not. What is certain is that this particular book is nothing more than a hysterical diatribe with little basis in fact, if any. I'll give it two stars to be charitable, since I pity this guy."
1,worthless,This is a great book if you are a knee-jerk conservative who wants confirmation that conservatives are great and liberals are evil.This book is worthless if you want to gain any insight or do any critical thinking.
1,Disappointing Read,"Sorry to be the bad news boy, but this is by far the weakest DH book yet. I've read most of his and he seems to be repeating himself. Take a pass on this one or wait for it to come to your library, but don't spend a dime on it."
4,Invaluable: A Death Cult Interventionist,"That's exactly the service David Horowitz is providing to those of us with enough remaining objectivity to recognize it.Having spent too many years lost in the quasi-religious Marxist miasma I can attest that this book NEEDS to be read widely.Mr. Horowitz simply presents all the facts, free of rant and cant, respecting a reader's common sense and willingness to be deprogrammed from all the Fifth Column propaganda that subtly or with a ludicrous obviousness saturates our culture.But judge for yourself!The Kool-Aid drinkers' mindlessly vituperative reaction to this well argued and clearly written book are abundantly on display amongst the other reviews.We are at war on two fronts, my friends. From much experience David Horowitz completely understands that fact. And all he needs to do is quote the great secular prophet of one death cultto prove it:""Everything that exists deserves to perish"" - Karl Marx, Eighteenth Brumaire"
5,Fantastic Book,"Horowitz has done it again. This bruising indictment of the American and European left's involvement and cultivation of the radical Islamic theories that are a basic tenant for terrorist attacks is quite scary. Horowitz's well-researched and thought out book clearly highlights the problems organizations such as the ACLU, CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) as well as others such as the NAACP not only have with America, but all that we stand for. They clearly hate our government, our way of life, capitalism and the principles on which our great nation was founded. Eventually, what this boils down to a support for the groups that hate America most, and in many case, they are radical Islamic terrorist groups. Horowitz's book should be required reading during this turbulent and sometimes scary time."
5,"Great book, great author","Who better than an ex-leftish himself to view and explain what is happening inside the left nowadays. Quite revealing, specially for current socialist Spain I live in."
1,There is no conspiracy!,"Horowitz demolishes a man of straw, but he is wrong in thinking that there is some sinister conspiracy. Reactionaries like Horowitz or Glen Beck can't deal with the fact that other people have different perspectives than them. The tag line says it all - the people who didn't want the US to invade Iraq didn't want the US to ""fail in the Middle East"", they just didn't think that the invasion was a wise foreign policy. There is no Unholy Alliance, the (essentially American!) liberal values that Horowitz misrepresents here are not compatible with Osama Bin Laden and his ilk, those who imagine a different foreign policy for the US are not traitors, and talking to people about what upsets them (also known as ""diplomacy"" or ""foreign policy"") does not make you a co-conspirator with them."
2,"It's like that movie ""Conspiracy Theory""...","...except in the movie, the conspiracy actually happened. Look, I'm a Republican, and I try to support my party. But give me a break: this book is embarrassing, and it makes us look like right-wing nutjobs. Most of the claims made in the book are demonstrably false, and most of the ""sources"" the author cites are opinion editorials... in other words, he takes one person's opinion, calls it a ""fact"" and uses it to back up his own opinion.If you want legitimate reading on foreign policy, read the National Journal or something. Bottom line is, this book is basically a sleazy attack that does the conservative cause a disservice."
5,David Nails it again...,What socialists and islamists share is their hatred for the freedom of the individual. David once again sheds light on things he knows so well.
1,You have got to be kidding me!,"A toy that is a baby with a tanning bed, what are we teaching young girls?"
1,does not work for newer computers (vista) do not buy,"as the caption applies it does not work for vista, and i got screwed over by this because it says nothing about it."
3,Unable to play on my Windows 7,"After installing, i got an error message saying a file needed to run Doom was missing. Think it was play.dll or something like that...i don't remember. Anyway, after searching online and finding a way to create the file through a copy-and-paste method, i was able to bring up the game. However, my display was reduced to a very scratchy view in the upper left corner of the screen. Unable to make the view larger, or to make the display clearer, i gave up and uninstalled Doom Collector's Edition. I was gonna return this item, but the seller only takes refunds if the post office damages the package, which they did not. Guess i'll either pawn it off or throw it in the trash...I've only given it as high a rating as i have, because i've owned it before, and enjoyed it quite a bit on my Windows XP computer, which i no longer own."
5,I've been hooked by 2 songs.,"I've only heard two songs of his - (Slow Bombing the World and Let's get lost, off the 'Blue Note Festival' 2000 & 2002 cd's (great cd's by the way)), and I love them. He has a beautiful mellow voice. I know I'll love the rest of his cd, if only I could find my Visa..."
2,This averages out to 2 stars...,"...4 stars for the album, and less than one for the cost! Almost $100? Please. If you really need to have this in CD format, then by all means shell out 10 times what iTunes is charging for MP3s."
5,Comphy!,"This is a really nice sweatshirt if you ask me. Its really soft and a little big just how i like it! I really liked the seller they got it to me fast, reccomended to any Eastern Michigan fan!"
5,Converted me to organic foods...sorta,I really hate that I bought this stuff. I originally bought it to try the Master Cleansing diet. After I read the book it sounded like a bad idea so I put it on some pancakes instead. It was so good I'm not sure I can ever go back to that flavored corn syrup they sell in the stores. Now my pancake habit is sure to cost me both extra dollars and extra pounds. I'm not sure why anyone would buy grade A...grade B tastes incredible.
5,Great Tasting Maple Syrup,"I buy this maple syrup every time I do a Master Cleanse. I love that it is organic and the taste, to me, is perfect. Some grade B syrups are very disappointing by being too dark and on the molassas side, not this one. I might also add that my kids love this and always steal it for their pancakes. Of course that makes me happy because I hate for them to use processed fake syrups since they are so bad for them."
4,"product good, beware of seller","I got this order in good time and the syrup is good, but when I got the package the bottle wasn't wrapped up and the lid had come open and some of the syrup had leaked out(just about a Tablespoon full)inside the box. This is the only problem I have with this seller, but the product is excellent. If the seller had wrapped the bottle before shipping I would have given five stars instead."
4,very good product,This product was very good; but I don't see any difference between grade A and Grade B. [...].
5,Grade B Maple Syrup is the Best,"This order arrived in a timely fashion and in one piece and not broken due to being packed improperly (as has happened in the past). It is delicious maple syrup and has a deep maple flavor. Grade B has more flavor than Grade A. If I could order grade C with an even deeper maple flavor, I would order that, if possible! I am very happy with this syrup. The local stores has 32-oz of maple syrup for the same price, but they only carry Grade A."
3,The Tenth Good Thing About Barney,"As a true pet lover, it is hard to read that tenth good thing - fertilizer! Children know how bad fertilizer smells - is this a good way to remember of loyal, loving friend? It is great to have the special memories of that special pet, but the 10th thing really STINKS! It may be appropriate for your individual beliefs, but review this book before sharing it with your special little one."
5,Childhood memories,"When I was a young girl in public school, the warm women who read to us always liked to give away 1 book to someone who... well, I frankly can't recall, but I believe it was for the student who read the most or something along those lines. As that was no challenge for me, I quickly came to my turn to choose the book. Without looking at the other choices, I chose this book, The Tenth Good Thing About Barney. I remembered this book years later when my precious kitten died and now, as I sit here an 18 year old woman sure of the mortality of my own aging cat, I remember it, and it is easier to bear. Praise be to books, and to Barney."
3,"Nice, but didn't fit our family",This is a nice story about a boy grieving the loss of his cat. I was recommended this book by my daughters' pediatrician to talk about death to my young daughters. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that the idea of Heaven was questioned. It just didn't work for our family's beliefs.
3,good--with important caveat,"When our third child died, my husband and I looked for books to help us talk with our older children, then 5 and 4, about death, and this book was recommended to us. It's a really nice book if a pet has died, but since the tenth good thing is that as Barney rots he helps the flowers grow, it's not the best for dealing with the death of a person--the thought of a loved one rotting can be really disturbing for a child."
4,Works well,"This winter I purchased a 10lb bag of bird seed and a 10lb bag of black oil sunflower seeds and fill the bird feeder with half and half mixture. I also got a few cakes and put them out. This cage holds a single cake of suet. The cage is made of sturdy vinyl coated wire.. This one sat out all winter and there is no sign of rust. The suet cake is being eaten, but I have never seen any birds eating it. If you look to purchase bulk suet cakes at Amazon, make sure to get the 12 oz ones."
3,Not very accurate,"I purchased two of these;one for the spa and one for the pool. I questioned the accuracy so put them side by side in the pool. One registers 76 degrees the other 81 degrees. I just have to figure out which, if either, is accurate."
5,Great little thermometer for your spa,It's a basic thermometer for your pool or spa. What else is there to say?
3,Works pretty well,"It does chill the bottle faster than putting it in the freezer, but it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, more like 10. It slips easily around every wine bottle I have used it on."
5,Great for baby bottles & sippy cups!!,"Though I haven't tried this with wine yet, this is a great product to keep your baby's bottle or sippy cup cool in the summer, without taking up a lot of space in the diaper bag. It could also be used to keep breast milk chilled. So much better than bulky ice packs--and it covers more of the bottle's surface area too. It doesn't leave any wet condensation on your diaper bag contents. No zippers to open; you can quickly slide the bottle in and out of the sleeve without taking it out of the bag. Great for mom & dad's water bottles too!"
1,IntroductionTo Fortran 90 For Engineers and Scientists,"I just receive the bookIntroduction to FORTRAN 90 for Engineers and Scientists, I bought it for $61 and I am very disappointed with the edition. It seems to be a low quality photocopy, there are some pages that I can hardly read."
1,very bad,It was pretty older than I thought. I don't like the quality. I am not gonna buy anything from this seller.
1,"Looks great, drives terrible!","I agree with the previous poster. We spent a lot of time finding the perfect looking stroller. While there are some nice features- namely the colors and fabric- you will kick yourself in the end when you are rolling this thing around the mall zigagging like a maniac trying to get the wheels to straighten out and actually drive in a straight line! This stroller makes me crazy. It also has a cupholder that falls off before you get the cup in it, a basket that you literally cannot use or else it rubs the wheels, and no tray for a child's snack or cup, etc. It is easy to collapse, but harder to open and is pretty bulky for storage (although it is nice and spacious inside.) But again, none of this really matters, because the thing doesn't move!!!"
2,ARGH!,"I hate this stroller. I researched strollers forever and KNEW this was the stroller for me. What I didn't realize (as a first time parent) was how huge it was and how much that would impact my daily life. If I was only using this stroller for going on bike paths and hiking trails, it might be great, but for getting around in day-to-day life, it is awful. The back two wheels are so wide that there are literally stores that I cannot walk through. The storage underneath is a little lacking, but that didn't bother me so much. I also had a wobble in the stroller that bothered me a lot. I wrote to the customer service department and they told me how to tighten a nut under the front tire and that they hoped that would fix the problem. I'll give it a try and see if that works, but if I had known what I was doing in the first place, I would never have gotten this stroller. :( Live and learn..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have to say, I did a lot of research when I was buying a stroller during my first pregnancy. I loved the look of the BumbleRide and the reviews at that time were great, but I soon realized how hard it was to push. Both my husband and I were very disappointed. Further, neither set of Grandparents could push the stroller in a straight line because it was always pulling or the wheels were getting turned around. Even after we figured out the correct wheel settings/locks we often got 'stuck' and couldn't maneuver well. I was envious of the strollers that could turn on a dime. The handle bar doesn't seem strong and I was unable to push down hard on it to get over bumps or turn myself around. I'll be looking for a new stroller for Baby #2."
3,could be better,"PROS:~ easily reversible so child can look out or at youCONS:~ Not easy to fold or open: when folding it scrapes on the ground wearing on theplastic, the plastic latch is difficult to manuver while opening it, the plasticlatch doesn't catch easily when folding it, need 2 hands to open and fold, bulkywhen folded...~ Car seat adapter bar isn't very sturdy, car seat (Britax Chaperone) just barelyfits width wise~ Not a very sturdy stroller. When pushing down to go over bumps/curbs the wholestroller flexes.~ Wheels get ""stuck"" easily on bumps, curbs, etc~ Material is ""slippery"". I have to frequently reposition my daughter because she slides down while in it."
5,Best stroller ever!,"I bought this stroller because I didn't want to buy a conventional stroller AND a jogging stroller. It seems that I would always be using the ""wrong"" stroller and wishing I were using the other. For a jogging stroller, it is extremely compact and fits into the trunk of my 3-series BMW (which isn't a large trunk). I love the fact that the footrest raises and lowers as well as the back--it goes completely flat like a bed. There's also loads of handy options. I highly recommend the ""carrycot"" (bassinet) attachment for newborns. You'll only need it for two months, but it is nice to have. Detach it and it serves as an extra baby bed at home. And the stroller looks cool :) I always get asked about my stroller! It's the gadget freak's best friend. Oh, and my baby loves it, too. My neighbors have a BOB and that thing is HUGE! This is definitely the way to go."
1,Dangerous,"I purchased this stroller last year and used it for about five months. It was unstable, improperly balanced and dangerous. Towards the end of the time I used it, the wheels started falling off. Needless to say, it nearly caused an accident with my newborn. Additionally, the ride was bumpy and would nearly tip over when going over a curb. I purchased a Bugaboo Frog when the wheels started falling off and love it. If I had the option, I would not give it any stars."
5,I love this stroller!,I just received my BumbleRide Flyer stroller and I love it! It is super easy to reverse the handle to look at baby and it was very easy to snap together. It looks very nice in person and we can't wait to try it out with our new baby.
1,Terrible Stroller,I have been through about 10 strollers with my 3 children and this is by far the worst and most expensive stroller I have purchased. Driving poorly is only the beginning of it's many design flaws. Don't buy it!
4,Super and thought-Provoking,"I saw bits and prices of this on television ad I liked it. It makes you rack your brain and really think outsider the box to try and figure out "" Who Done It.""I like that! Its quite raunchy!, but enjoyed it!"
5,Great,Considering this show was only made this 3-4 seasons I wanted to get all the seasons for my DVD and for my family.
1,"received only season one with ""seasons one and two"" dvd case cover","ordered this (seasons one and two on 8 dvd's), received only season one on 4 dvd's in dvd case with seasons one and two cover"
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!,What an amazing journey you take with this show. Everyone should watch it and learn the true meaning of life and how it can unfold! LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!!
2,Just ok luckily they were inexpensive,I ordered these for Christmas and when the package came it was empty. When we called they sent new ones out but they took almost two weeks and long after Christmas. From the picture the sticks looked like they were ribbed like the ones in our music class but they weren't so my son doesn't really like them. For less than $2 not really worth the hassle.
4,Jeff Crook Rawks!,":D I really enjoyed this book. As always, I wanted to hear more about the gullydwarves, but otherwise it was a fun read. I hadn't read much about the Dragonlance dwarves before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I liked Crook's _Conundrum_ much much better."
1,Short humans?,"Maybe i'm expecting something else but I expect some clear guidelines between humans,dwarves and elves. there is some grey in the differences between humans and elves but to me dwarves were always different.In this book Jeff crook has made the dwarves out to be conniving and subject to mass hysteria and in almost every other dragonlance book I have read the dwarves are mostly level headed and have are always willing to band together in times of crisis..From an interview of Jeff Crook's i read that he wanted to create a feeling similar to 9/11 however if 9/11 had happened to the dwarves by their very nature they would have built back from the rubble united as never beforeThe dwarves in this book are well.........short humans..No thanks!!!"
2,"The Worst of the Best . . . well, Second Best","Jeff Crook is my favorite Dragonlance author--after Richard Knaak, anyway--but I have yet to understand why he wrote this the way he did. One event in Thorbardin's history, an event which never proves significant to the plot of the novel, is described in excruciating detail no fewer than seven times! Other than that, this novel mostly seems dull, unlike Crook's other, funnier works."
2,not as much as i hoped for,"taking a basic german class, and i was hoping this would be a good supplement for all the online dictionaries and translations. unfortunately, its not detailed enough."
1,Real letdown,"This slingshot looks really rugged in the pictures. So, I couldn't resist. But, when I received it and inspected it, I really don't feel confident in it. Not only do I feel that it is poorly manufactured. I think it's downright unsafe. I've also tried the Marksman and Daisy wrist rockets. I would recommend either of those over this one any day."
3,A decent slingshot with a couple of design issues,"Overall this is a good slingshot but I have a couple of design related issues to report. First, the folding handle is hard to work. Its easy enough to open but hard to close so concealing it in a hurry problematic. Second, storing ammo in the handle is a great idea until you hear how much it rattles while you walk. If you ever plan on sneaking up on anything, you're better off carrying your ammo in your pocket.Of course, no one I know would need an easily concealable slingshot that doesn't rattle, I just thought I'd point those things out..."
2,Not like the older ones,Was dissapointed in the band. Feels VERY VERY weak relative to the older version of 10 years ago. shot the steel balls and they have no speed. I would rather shoot rocks out of the slingshot.
4,I'M HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE,"I'VE ONLY SHOT IT A FEW TIMES, IT SHOOTS OK AND FEELS OK. I ORDERED IT BECAUSE IT FOLDED UP AND I BELIEVE IT WILL BE OK AS A SURVIVAL SLINGSHOT. IF I BUY ANOTHER I'LL TRY AND FIND ONE A LITTLE MORE CONFORMABLE AND WITH STRONGER TUBING. OVERALL I'M HAPPY WITH IT FOR THE PRICE."
1,The Worst ... I've Ever Read,"Evan Hunter has written some good books but not this time. You have to ask yourself why anyone would write a book about characters that no one would never want to spend a moment with, let alone read about...in a so-called plot that is depressing and irrelevant to most ordinary readers. This sad, dull book is replete with a lot of flashbacks of earlier years in the lives of the first-person ""writer"" and his sister, who is mentally and emotionally [messed] up. A lot of dialogue but nothing happens. In the end nothing happens. It takes a whole book for the so-called characters to decide to get help for the sister. Do not waste your time on this drivel. Wish I could have given it a minus-stars revue. Blah!"
1,Poorly written and a... disappointment to a real fan,"A rotten non-story with no beginning, no end and no plot. This is the first con job by this author!"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I'd been after this book for ages, and I finally got my hands on it (on honeymoon, no less), I found it almost impossible to put down. As a confirmed Ed McBain fan, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but unlike what one of the other reviewers says below, this book is filled with characters that seem more 'real' and 'human' - I defy anyone with a shred of emotion or empathy not to care about what happens to the characters Mr Hunter creates here.I've read most McBain novels, and a lot of Hunter novels. To my mind, this is the best Hunter novel...ever - I found it more affecting and much harder to put down than ""The Blackboard Jungle"", which is the book Hunter is most well known for to most people.I simply can't recommend this book highly enough. Isn't there a ranking better than 5 stars??"
5,Evan Hunter Scores Again,"Evan Hunter has an immaculate sense of plot and character development. Books written under his name are always different, intriguing and exciting. His command of the English language is second to none. His deft story lines are compelling. From the moment I picked up this book, I was under his spell and found it hard to put it down. ""The Moment She Was Gone"" focuses on the twin sister of the narrator and their history over the years. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys suspense and good writing."
4,Bangle,"I purchased this bracelet for my two year old granddaughter. I am satisfied with the weight of the bracelet and have had it engraved.My granddaughter thinks ""it's pretty"".The only issue I have with it is it is difficult to open the latch."
4,Really Cute,"I bought this as a gift. Ironically- it fit nice on a 12 year old, but not the 9 year old(larger wrist) that i bought it for. I had to send it back because it didnt fit. It doesnt 'completely' open. there is like a metal extender in the inside. Still Gorgeous."
2,not worth the money.,"Not what I thought doesn't stay cool long, needs to be a full sized pillow not a little pad. The little pad tends to slide off the pillow and again does not stay cool"
2,Loved the idea.... but it's a pipe dream..,"It's too easy to get scrunched up or pushed to the top of the pillow. I used it for a week.. then it went into the closet. The idea is great... and as far as cooling goes, it works OK.. but does get warm after a while just like you would expect. It might work better if it had some way to attach it to the pillow to keep it in place."
2,Returned this,This didn't work for me...it ends up being your body temperature once the chill has worn off. Cumbersome and I ended up returning it.
3,Pros and Cons,"I bought this Chillow for my wife who is illl and needs comfort. She is sleeping in a hospital bed which has the head raised. The Chillow is not good for this application. It is very heavy when it is filled with the water which activates it. It weighs as much as two quarts of water. It could not stay in place on the bed in the pillow case or not.I use the Chillow on my bed. My bed is flat; I use one pillow. I use the Chillow inside my pillowcase. If I need a cool pillow I flip the pillow Chillow side up. If I don't need the Chillow I flip the pillow Chillow side down. It is really COOL, sometimes too cool. I will really appreciate it in the summer.I am concerned about punctures. It is not guaranteed against punctures. If punctured I loose my Chillow."
5,Chillow brought relief for chemo induced menopause in young woman with breast cancer,The chillow has changed my daughter's life. She is suffering from chemo induced menopause and this has made sleeping at night possible. A research trial nurse suggested it and we are so grateful. This product should be marketed for this group of women and carried in the shops located at treatment centers.
3,Mixed Feelings for Chillow,"I have regular fevers and occasional night sweats...so I was really looking forward to this. The coolness is really soothing and nice when falling off to sleep...I've even thought how great it would be to have a whole body-sized chillow. But by morning, Chillow has snuck off the pillow, curled over to reveal it's pool-toy esque plastic side, and stuck to my upper back and neck. Not only that, but it absorbs so much heat from me, that it feels more like a heating pad by morning. It is so warm that my boyfriend rolled over on it and thought it was a hot water bottle. This makes me sad because I really like it when I'm trying to fall asleep...if only I could heave it off my bed in my sleep."
1,Don't buy a Chillow,"""This is the WORST item ever. DO NOT BUY IT!!! It doesn't work!!! I returned the first one, and they sent me a second to try, in case it was defective. It wasn't, it just doesn't work. It slips down if you turn over at night, to between your shoulder and your pillow. It also doesn't stay cold at all. The second one didn't work either, and they made me pay to ship that one back."""
2,mold issue,"I purchased this last year for my tween daughter. She has itchy skin, eczema and allergies. It has helped somewhat with her overheating at night. She sleeps on 100% cotton sheets to reduce skin irritation also. We've had a problem since the beginning with the plastic smell, but tried to deal with it, and air out her room during the day. We've had to add water twice this past year, and have used filtered water both times. Just the other day I put my head on her pillow and noticed an odor. It wasn't plastic this time, it was musty. I opened it up and there were tiny black mold specks all over the foam inside. Use caution as the product says not to drain the chillow or add any other liquid other than water."
1,Does not stay cold. Does not stay flat.,"I have to put mine in the refrigerator every single day to get it cold for the night, and then before morning it is warm again. And the foam pad (or whatever it is) inside of it is bunching up toward the middle of the case, so now there is only about 50% cold surface. It will not straighten out and there is no way to open the case or work the pad to straighten it out. You have to put it inside of a pillow case, because the thing feels awful to the direct touch, and even putting it inside the pillow case, it slips around the pillow, and doesn't stay just on one side. Really stupid implementation for the amount of money they charge for this thing."
1,Chillow is in the trash,"This product not worth the packaging it came in. Didn't even make it through one night. I don't know where the great reviews came from, but it didn't satisfy this customer. It didn't stay cool through the night and was leaking by morning. It was a disaster and promptly went in the trash. I am back to turning over my pillow all night. A waste of my money and time. Don't bother. Makes me wonder if Dr. Oz tried this prouct out himself before giving it a glowing recommendation! Ha!"
1,Save Your Money!,"I can't believe they are still selling these things! I felt like a real sucker after buying one. I tried it as directed and what a joke. The directions say that when the spot becomes warm to move your head. DUH! Same thing you'd do with a regular pillow, only a regular pillow doesn't smell funny or feel crinkly-plastic. Buy a small fan and stick a bowl of ice cubes in front of it. It makes more sense then this thing."
3,Helps you fall asleep but wakes you up,It's absolutely cool and helps me fall asleep. But one thing that drives me nuts is about 4 hours into sleep it feels incredibly warm and forces me to flip the pillow (which is much heavier with this in the pillowcase). I wish they could at least have it warm only to room temp instead of what feels like about 110 degrees somewhere around 3am.
1,Disappointing,"I really did not like the dampness it left on me or my bed. I tried to give it a few days of getting used to, but I found that it jus made me wake up with more sweat. I finally switched to another ""hot flash pillow"" and it works the way I need it to without the damp residue the chillow always left behind. Best of luck to all having night sweats out there."
3,Great until the seams split,"I bought two Chillows at the same time. The seam was split on the first one and leaked as I put the water in the first time. The second was great for the 4 nights I used it - really cool and it helped me sleep. However, the 4th night, the seam split and I awoke with a soaked bed.I hope the company that manufactures the Chillow and the Canine Cooler pet bed will increase the quality."
4,Fantastic product with a few flaws,"I love the Chillow! I am preparing to buy my 8th one; I have been through 3 and given others as gifts to other ""hot sleepers"" of my acquaintance. That said -- and the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 -- I wish they provided a deluxe version that was just FILLED already - and permanently sealed. I would be willing to pay the extra for shipping, packaging, etc. Setting the thing up is awkward and challenging, and I have experienced leaks. The last one even got mildew-y at some point. In spite of its challenges, though, this is a wonderful product -- being able to slap it on my pillow and sink down onto its blessed coolness has saved many a night's sleep in spite of hot flashes and night sweats."
3,COOL PILLOW,WORKS BUT IT HAS A SMELL THAT HAS TAKEN QUITE A LONG TIME TO DISAPATE. BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT AND MY FRIEND COULD NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF THE ODOR.
3,not as good as it once was,"I have had chillow's before and they have been a life saver, this one that I bought just doesn't seem to have what it takes this time. It doesn't feel as cooling or as comfortable as the last ones I had."
2,Has to be the most garbage product I've bought on Amazon.,"This Chillow has to be the most garbage product I have ever bought on Amazon, and I've bought a lot of stuff on Amazon. I would probably return this if I could. I followed every single direction for this Chillow and it does feel cool. Initially. But the Cool feeling does not last and goes away in less than an hour. I guess the bodyheat my head produces overwhelms even this Chillow. Now it's just sitting on the side of my bed like the five pound bag of water that it is."
5,Chillow is the BEST!!!,"I have had my Chillow for about 4 years now and I love it! My son heard about it and suggested I try it for my terrible (menopause) night sweats & hot flashes. I think my Chillow practically saved my quality of life. Before the Chillow - almost no sleep. After - blissful, wonderful rest.I put mine into its own pillowcase cover and put it on top of my regular pillow. For me, this works the best. I also have to turn it around to the cold side once during the night (because my head makes it warm up where I've been laying on it) but I always go right back to sleep with my cool Chillow. I bought a second one as a ""backup"" because I could never stand to sleep without it. I recommended the Chillow to a friend who was also having hot flashes during the night and she tells me all the time how she loves it and is so thankful I suggested it to her."
4,Love my Chillow,The Chillow really helps keep you cool at night.The only negative is that it slips around on top of another pillow - but putting it in a snugly fitting pillowcase with another pillow helps keep it in place.
3,"Great idea, could be better","We were so excited at the thought of the chillow that we bought three. It's great when you first lay down on it but the ""chill"" doesn't last all that long and it's not as cool as you had hoped. We debated returning them but it does feel nice when you are falling asleep."
2,chillow not so chilled,I requested the chillow for Xmas. It was cool but did not remain cool. The reviews were accurate. This is NOT a four star or more product. I even put it in the freezer! The chiller was not so cool after all.Save your money and get a gel pack that you can keep in the freezer. You can always make it less cool with towels.
3,Keeps the temp down but it moves and rolls in to a little long tube!,"I have purchased a few of these and everyone is happy with with the cooling effect, however, if you don't secure it in a tight pillow case/cover, it will move and eventually turns into a gel tube that is hard to reshape to its original. My son is 3 and a 1/2 so his doesn't move as much but it is a different story for my husband. I have to make sure that moving the pillow or his head will not move the chillow!"
3,The Chillow sounded like a cool item but ...,"The Chillow's coolness doesn't last as long as I thought it would ... not much better than turning a pillow over to the cooler side. Once it is warm, you have to remove it from the pillow slip and let it cool down again - but you have to lay it flat, so it usually ends up on the floor beside my bed so I don't have to get out of bed to place it on the surface of a dresser across the room. It is also not particularly comfortable to sleep on since it is flat, semi firm, and slips off any pillow on which you place it.It sounded like a terrific idea, but it didn't live up to my expectations."
2,don't bother to purchase,This pillow leaked after a few times of use. When I checked I noticed a small tear in the pillow - how can you get a small tear on a pillow in bed?I do not recommend it because the quality is inferior and did not last long enough. Another problem is that it crinkled up all the time and I was forever flattening it out during it's short life in my bed.
1,Leaks,"I was very excited to use this product. I filled it to the recommended amount and used it successfully for a few weeks.This morning, around 2 AM, I woke to find the bed soaked with water that smelled as one would expect it would after being in a plastic bag for a couple of weeks. Not pleasant.I would urge anyone considering this purchase to think about what it really is... a plastic bag filled with water that you bring into bed with you. After I say that, I realize how silly it was to think it would work w/out leaks... Oh well. Lesson learned."
4,Sleeping through the night....finally!,"I would have liked to have known that you have to fill it with water. Other than that, I love it! I can use it with or without a pillow. It keeps my head cool throughout the night and prevents the pillow flipping. I would recommend this product."
2,Hard to Cozy Up To Vinyl,"Followed instructions and have been using the chillow more about 2 mos. I can't put the chillow in the pillow case as it slides around and bunches up (it's heavy!). I am a very hot and rough sleeper (side sleeper who tosses a lot) and the chillow would scrunch up and slide off the pillow when used on top of the pillow. Sometimes it's hard to straighten it out again in the morning. It does begin cool, but does heat up after a while, but you cna flip it to find a cool spot. It's hard to cozy up to latex-it's cool but not very comfy. Sadly, the chillow was not the solution for me, but as noted, I am a challenge!"
3,Chillow,"I use Chillow on my back at night and it works well for about an hour and then gets warm. I was hoping for a product that stayed cool longer. For short relief from aches and night sweats, it is ok but didn't fill my expectations exactly as promised."
2,To Heavy,"This pillow is way too heavy and does not stay cool all night. The inside rolls up. Hurts my arms just rotating it. I prefer the small light one with the gel pods now that stays COLD, so cold that you have to move it away for a while and no rotating."
3,Item works as descibed but still needs a little design work,"The Chillow pillow does what it purports to do. It makes my head more cooler and comfortable when sleeping. The only flaw is that the interior fill tends to bunch up in a corner of the pillow, requiring a special procedure to correct. Perhaps the speed in which this occurred, (several days) is because I tend to toss and turn a lot when I sleep. A more placid sleeper may not experience this problem. Nonetheless, it basically solves a problem I have long had when sleeping, especially during the warm summer months and I recommend it to anyone who experiences uncomfortable warmth in the head area when sleeping."
5,The Chillow Really Works!,"Place a chillow inside your regular pillow case, and feel the cool memory foam wick heat away from your head, neck and shoulders. A friend told me about this product, and I ordered it from Amazon when I couldn't find it in local health and beauty retailers. It's a sealed waterproof rectangular case with about a half inch thick slab of memory foam inside. You add about 9 cups of water to the envelope and reseal the watertight valve after squeezing out all the air bubbles. Then the foam works to cool you when your skin comes into contact. It has helped me get much better sleep, and I don't think I could sleep at all without it now. I highly recommend it."
4,A great night's sleep,"This is the second Chillow I'm ordering. My first one did develop a leak only because I've used it every night for a year and a half. I am addicted to this device. It's real cool when you first lay your head down, but then throughout the night it never goes above your body temperature so you do sleep really sound. Since I've been without mine, I've been waking up and flipping the pillow again. It does take a little getting used to but once you do, oh boy."
3,Kind of disappointing,"I have to admit that it's easier to use than I was led to believe. And at first it really does seem to keep cool in spite of proximity to your body. But after a few hours of sleeping on it, I found that I woke up with my face and hair damp with sweat.Perhaps this was because the night was so humid, I don't know. All I know is that several times during the night, I was forced to pull the Chillow out of my pillowcase and move it away from my body. After a few minutes, I could put my head back down on it and it would be cool again. I will continue to work with it, but my first response to it was not as favorable as I would have hoped."
1,Beware The Chillow,"The Chillow underperformed its' claims. First, I couldn't discern any difference between the Chillow and a regular down pillow when it came to keeping me cooler.Second, the vinyl material has a distinct and strong odor emission. If you are allergic to the chemical smell of vinyl, this is a product to avoid like the plague.Third. with most sellers of this product, there is a ""No Return, No Refund"" policy. If you find it doesn't perform or you can't stand the vinyl odor, tough. You're stuck with it.And, lastly, don't waste any time contacting the developer company, Soothsoft Comfort Technology, with product complaints. They do not respond.If I had this purchase to do over, I wouldn't. And, if it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would."
2,"Great for a few hours, but after that back to warm and clammy","I sleep very warm. While my wife loves this, with any regular pillow I wake up with a sweaty warm pillow. I flip it over and that side proceeds to do the same thing. I bought the chillow in hopes that it would help with this and keep my head cool all night. WHat I quickly found out is that it kept my head cool for the first few hours, but half way through the night I woke up to a warm clammy plasticy even more unpleasant feel against my face. I tried cooling it before going to bed, that just made it too cold to start, but eventually it got warm again too. What would be ideal is a chillow with a water cooling system like my old gaming PC had. something where the water is continually cooled. This is not that product and I have quit using my chillow. For as much as it cost, I really expected a better way for it to dissipate the heat."
4,My son loves it,Bought it for my son. He would sweat a lot at night. He loves it. Would have rated it 5 stars but it does have a certain smell to it.
4,Great but 1 problem,VERY NEAT!!!! It stays cool throughout the night and into the morning. Very cool invention!!! :)One problem is that is bulges up in one spot by morning time. Any suggestions would be great!
4,chillo,"Excellent to help me stay cool in the night.Has lessened the hot flushes, but but where I lay gets very warm and we do need to cool it for 30 minutes each day in the fridge."
2,Not worth it,It is cool when you lie down at first but then it turns to your own body temperature. No help for me in the middle of the night!!
4,Keeps her cool,"This thing works in that it helps cool my wifes head naturally. It is important to understand that it doesn't have any ""active"" cooling features. It does it's magic using the wet foam pad inside to help draw heat away from the head area."
2,Don't do it....................,"I used this pillow twice and both times it only stayed cool for about two hours. Then it got warm and never got cold again. I called the co. but there answer was to make sure the air was out. It is, and it didn't.............. so beware."
2,Good until it molds,"I bought the chillow to help me sleep due to hot flashes. It worked quite well all summer. Sometimes the foam inside did get all balled up, and it was hard to straighten it out, but overall it helped me sleep all summer.When the temperatures cooled down, I wasn't needing the chillow,so I put it up.I know the directions said to keep the water in it and lay it flat with nothing on top. This I did. When temperatures started changing again,I got it out. Problem-it looked like patches of mold on the outside. Anyway, I threw it away. Now I'm looking for something that worked like the chillow, that I can clean inside and out."
2,"a great idea, but overall a waste of money","I had been waiting for something like the chillow for years, as I get very hot at night. After filling the chillow, I was excitedthat both the texture of the pillow, and the dispersion of temperature throughout the pillow's surface were even. I am always looking for a cool corner of my pillow at night, so this was key. However, as the night wore on, the chillow lost all of its coolness, and really seemed like it was absorbing my body heat. By morning, my head was hotter than if I had used a regular pillow.Throughout the month that I used it, I regularly chucked it off my bed (no mean feat, as it does weigh around ten pounds filled with water). This of course caused the chillow to deform, and like another reviewer, I had an impossible time trying to get it to reform its original shape.The chillow is a great idea, and I hope there is an improved version at some point. But overall, this piece is a waste of money."
1,it just balls up! what a mess1,"It just turns into a wrinkled up mess! and it heats back up half way thru the night, I hate it!"
1,Chillow leaked within 60 days,It's probably a great concept but needs to be made by someone who can keep it from leaking. My Chillow has a leak in under 60 days. Don't spend your money on this brand.
3,Chillow review,"It's a good product only if you follow the directions to the ""T"", get all excess air out after you pour the water in the chillow, (when using) move the product around if it becomes too warm for you, the edges need to be stronger because that's where my Chillow eventually cracked AND LEAKED out!!!! Add a half a cup of water maybe each month or it will evaporate (eventually), don't treat it like a kickball and it will last 10-12 mos. The edges definitely need to be strengthened for longer life."
3,Great for migraines,"This product is great for people that have migraines. I know that I am always looking for an ice pack when I get my daily migraine. The only drawback to this product is that the pad inside does not stay flat, and there is no way to get the wrinkles out to keep the product flat to press out the wrinkles."
4,Good product.,"The Chillow is definitely keeping me cooler at night than flipping the pillow ever did. It is soft and easy to use. I think I need two, however. I want another one to keep in reserve. I will recommend this product to anyone who is having trouble sleeping because of hot flashes. It is relaxing to feel that cool on my face and neck, and it is much better than turning a fan on my head."
5,Awesome for hot sleepers,"I am a person that wakes up several times at night because I get too hot and the Chillow has been awesome! I have slept 3 nights straight with the Chillow and it has really improved my sleep quality and comfort. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is a ""hot sleeper"""
5,Cool sleep heaven,"I have really enjoyed my chillow. Many people complained that it eventually gets hot as the night progresses. So I came up with an idea and it works. When I go to bed, my regular pillow is cool and it starts getting warm little by little and by around 4 o'clock am, when I get up to go to the bathroom, it is hot all over. So, I put my chillow inside a pillow underneath my regular pillow and go to sleep like that. Then when I wake up early in the AM, I remove the pillow with the chillow from underneath and put it on top of my regular pillow.Problem solved. I then have a fresh cool chillow and I am able to fall asleep without burning up. I really recommend it.Chillow Comfort DeviceBeatriz V. Austin, Kinston, NC"
2,Would return if it wasn't filled with water,"If you leave your head in one place for a long time--when you're sleeping--it doesn't work. It's actually hotter than a regular pillow. It works okay by moving it around when you're awake. But I got it to use underneath my pillowcase when I'm sleeping, and it doesn't work well for that."
5,Sleeping cool!!,"I love my new chillow. I am sleeping much better now. The rest of my family thinks I am crazy because this pillow is so cold, but I am in heaven!"
1,smells moldy,The pillow is way too heavy. It crushes the pillow you put under it. After a few months it smelled awful!
3,not so great,"While this item does keep your head cool it is not so comfy, it could us a cushion of some sort. The plastic that you lay on even in a pillow cover is not that comfy"
3,Chillow,"The product does keep you cool for awhile but then does warm up, for me it happened fairly quickly- less than an hour"
1,Stinks and Sucks,"These two words are what come to mind when I think about this Chillow Cool Comfort pillow I recently purchased. I've tried wiping it off with cleaner, Clorox wipes and then finally spraying it with perfume...NOTHING WORKED....Also once the coolness dies on the area your laying on you have to constantly rotate it to keep it cool if not you'll be sweating big time!!"
4,"Great for hotflashes, but developed leak after 1 year","I absolutely love my chillow during a hotflashes when I'm in bed. I just drape it over my chest for instant relief. It cools me down quickly enough that the heat doesn't rise all the way up to my face and head. I am so disappointed that after 1 year it has developed pinhole leaks. I've become dependent on it, so if the duct tape and packing tape patches don't work, I will probably replace it."
1,Too Hard to Use,It takes a lot of work to use this product. I thought it would be easier - so if you are invested - it might be good -but be prepared to use a lot of your time!
3,"It's okay, but I won't be purchasing another.","I bought this primarily to go inside my pillow but after the first two nights I HAD to move it. It bunches up during sleep and is very difficult to get back to regular form. Plus, moving it around inside the pillow is a hassle. However, I now use it at my feet and it is relaxing."
4,Cools when I need it,"I have severe hot flashes, approximately 1-2 an hour. I'm going crazy with them & trying to get cool. The chillow does cool me down, but within 10 minutes, it is more like a heating pad than a cooling device... that's how hot I get. I let it re-cool & use it again when needed. It is pretty heavy & flattens my pillow so I usually just lay on it and it cools my back & upper neck, for that purpose it works well."
1,Smells like a hospital bed,"This product works but I'm sorry to say, it smells like a hospital bed. It smells like plastic and bad chemicals."
2,"Starts Cool, Ends Very Hot","The Chillow, like many other reviewers have pointed out, feels great at first. But it only takes an hour or so for it to warm up past your own body temperature. I ended up putting it in a seperate pillow case on top of my pillow so I could shove it off in the middle of the night."
4,The cure for night sweats!!,"Mine arrived yesterday and last night was the first ""night sweat free"" sleep I've had in weeks!! I also found that it's wonderful for the cool/heat therapy for my aching joints.My only qualm is trying to get all the air out while keep the water in. /c:"
1,Chillow does NOT deliver on its promise!,"Bought the chillow for my hubby who sweats all night long even with the fan and AC going.It was a pain in the butt to fill the first time and we had water leakage everywhere when trying to get out the air bubbles despite letting it sit for a full 4 hours as recommended.He finally started using it to dismal results. It is cool at first but then fades away unless you constantly keep moving it around. (same thing you can do with a regular pillow when you're trying to find a cool spot)Problem with moving it is that it weighs approx 3-5lbs and slides all over the place in the pillow sack! The product also smells like rubber...yuck! Not pleasant.I would NOT recommend this to a friend and if I was not so stubborn, I wouldv'e listened to the negative comments before I purchased it and saved my money.I took a chance and regret it. Don;t be foolish like I was. Don;t bother with the Chillow.PS- Sorry OPRAH, this is NOT a ""favorite thing""."
2,Disappointed,"I was sooo looking forward to receiving this device. I have hot flashes as night and hoped for a good night of ""cool"" sleep. The Chillow I received leaked! and instead of a ""cool"" nights sleep I got a ""wet, cold"" night of little sleep. But, I returned the Chillow and Amazon promptly refunded my money."
1,Chillow doesn't stay cool,I purchased the Chillow for a friend. She said that it is cool initally when going to bed but warms up with body heat. Not worth the money
1,Suck-o,The chillo stays cool for abt 5 min then it actually becomes overly warm. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's a tip off
2,Chillow Pillow,A friend of mine loved this product & said it saved her marriage! I was not impressed with it at all. The chillow only stayed cool for about 20 minutes. I was very disappointed in my purchase.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed! It IS cool--but only for 10-15 minutes. Then it tends to just be a ""hot mess"". Sleeping on wrinkled, warm vinyl--not pleasant."
1,Don't waste your money,"A complete waste of money! This is like sleeping on a metal slab or plank of wood. VERY uncomfortable, stiff and heavy. A total rip-off."
4,I have no idea how it works but it does.,I have no idea how this works but it is still cool and I use it every night. My only complaint is it takes a while to get used to it because it is very firm so not as comfortable as a soft fluffy pillow but the trade off when you're premenopausal and it's 100 degrees? It's worth it :)
4,Cillow review,Nice product. Can get a little messy if you dont let the water absorb. Stays cool for a long time.
5,Great cooling pillow!,"My wife gave me this wonderful gift and I absolutely love it! Some nights I sweat a lot (!!!), so this is actually pretty helpful and definitely has a nice cooling effect! Much better than waking up with a little ""lake"" on my pillow. :)"
2,Son't waste your money,"I purchased this chillow and was hoping it was worth the $$$. However, I used it only two times before it started leaking. It feels cool for only a few minutes after you lay your head down. Save your $$ and buy a water bottle instead."
4,Chillow,"I have been a pillow flipper all my life, always looking for the cool side.I have found the chillow to be comfortable and helpful.It has ""scrunched"" up on me a couple of times, but the fix (which they explain) is quick and easy. I kept the receipt because if I didn't like it I would definitely return it, but I do like it. p.s. I was really surprised how heavy it is 4.5 lbs with the water added. It doesn't matter because you are laying on it and not flipping. It probably actually helps to keep it in place over the pillow."
3,"Great product, not all companies deliver to APO address","The Chillow is a great product, I have had one before. If you are someone who flips there pillow at night to get the ""cool side"" you will love it. However I ordered this from Smarthome to send to my husband who is on a military deployment, and though the website says they will ship to APO/ FPO addresses - they could not. I was informed by telephone and email, and the purchase was refunded. Excellent customer service, but unfortunately couldn't ship the product."
4,Glad I purchased the Chillow!,"The Chillow works well at the beginning of the night, but the cooling sensation wears off. The Chillow is heavy and it's hard to move around during the night. However, I like it and I am glad I purchased it."
4,good book for a good price,I had to read this book for my latin american history class. I was totally satisfied i got the book for $5.00 cheaper than our college bookstore. It was in great shape and arrived within three days of me ordering. very satisfied
5,"Great for the gray age group, too.",This is a delightful book. I read it to about 30 nursing home patients and they really loved it. There are lots of children's books that are enjoyable to all age groups and this one was perfect. I read a book every month as part of a 1 hour volunteer activity time.
4,Who wrote this?,"I can tell that whoever wrote the scripts did not write the book. Actually I have read Assault on Lake Casitas by Brad Alan Lewis. Rescued from Prime Time definitely exhibits his intelligent writing style. What is he doing associating himself with Baywatch? I guess this is one way to bring a little class to this old, cliched TV series. By the way, the Baywatch book is pretty interesting."
4,Great introduction to the art of journaling,"This quick read is a wonderful way to introduce non-journalists to the art and purpose of journaling. It teaches why journaling is so important and helpful in an individual's spiritual growth. Looking back over the past to see growth in your life is a great encouragement! Reviewing past needs and prayers means witnessing God's answers and provision from the fresh perspective of the present! It's a perfect addition to tuck in with the gift of a journal to your prayer partner, best friend, or bible study group. Also, a great stocking stuffer."
5,Heart-rending portraits,"If you're a serious photographer or photography enthusiast, it cannot be not in your library. It should be on your shelf along with ""The Americans"" of Robert Frank and other photographers' photographers' opus. Toni Morrison's introduction essay prepares the reader perfectly for what's to come."
5,Courage,"First, I commend National Geographic for it's active role in distributing a probably money losing movie that has as it's core storyline a topic that is uncomfortable to discuss and even more difficult to rectify. Second, the practice is extremely common affecting the majority of females throughout western and eastern northern equatorial Africa; parts of the Middle East and to a much smaller extent the rest of the world. Third, through political, economic and educational empowerment for females the practice is beginning to decline - slowly, gradually.The story of Waris Dirie whether correctly embellished or not is still remarkable, however the core storyline is circumcision (mutilation) and sparking that first step - discussion, is this movie."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This product is junk. I bought 2 of them thinking ""What a nice Xmas gift"". Instead, I tried to install their software and the device and it doesn't work. I called the manufacturer Royal and they said ""It won't work on 64 bit operating system just 32-bit. Probably defective, return it to where you bought it"". I told him I was on a 32-bit and asked him, what are the odds that both are defective? Thanks for the no help service."""
4,Royal 39103T PF141 Digital Travel Clock and Photo Frame,"I received the Royal 39103T PF141 Digital Travel Clock and Photo Frameas a gift. It's a clever little gadget that works as advertised. It has one limitation - the photos must be loaded into this photo travel clock from a Windows PC (I used the PhotoViewer software with Windows XP). The Macintosh PhotoViewer software from the Royal support site does not work with this photo travel clock. However, the Mac PhotoViewer software works very well with the Nextar N1-501 keychain photo frame and the Neutrano Photo Watch. It's really nice of Royal to help their competitors!"
1,Disappointed,"Given this Royal Digital Picture Album Travel Clock as a gift PF141.Clock works, but that is all. Loaded software, my PC with Windows Vista couldn't see the device. Uninstalled, reinstalled,unhooked, rehooked, etc., but no go. Then I read these reviews and realized I am not alone. Thought about using it as a travel clock, but the battery is recharged through your PC when it is hooked up and there is no way I can find to tell if the battery is low, so you couldn't depend on it as an alarm on the road. Can't return it as I don't know where the gifter bought it, so it is a total loss."
5,wonderful bellydance music,"The various songs in this traditional Middle Eastern cabaret Dance album are wonderful for the bellydancer who is looking for music with many transitions and a longer routine. Most songs are over 5-9 minutes long, with one drum routine that is over 16 minutes! I highly recommend it for the dancer who is looking for more then the latest pop music for her dance options."
2,Pretty Pictures,"This is a average book, lots of pretty pictures no real meat. As they indicate, if you don't have Lightwave experience you will have problems since half of the controls shown in the book have changed in the final version of Lightwave 6.5. When they offer a updated information page on Dan's web site, it may be then worth half the price they currently charge. Even the example avi files that come with the book are low grade. Buy inside lightwave 6"
2,"Effects yes, Magic No",I was rather disappointed with this book. It was easy enough to follow but the final results were still pretty amateurish looking. Surely Lightwave 6.5 can do better than this!
1,What A Waste!,"I was all excited about this book because it was suppose to be for 6.5, but the controls are not for 6.5 in this book!The tutorials also don't work right. I tried several of the methods and they never work right. This book will just become a dust collector now :(Don't waste your money on this book!"
3,Lightwave 6.5 Magic,"After reading this book , I discovered I hadn't learned a whole lot. Probably a better book for beginners to help them explore new possibilities, but for someone a little more familiar with LW it isn't worth. Just discusses examples of basic expressions, lighting and some animation."
3,"Great intro, but magic?","Being new to Lightwave, I found this book full of helpful tutorials and good, if sometimes light, discussion on how to apply the lessons in your own work. I recommend this book if you are looking for that, if you don't already know Lightwave, or are intimidated by Mr. Ablan's giant indepth LW book. If you are looking for help with cutting edge, Matrix or Gladiator (the Colussuem is LW) level work, this isn't for you. I know what other programs are capable of, and LW seems to make that type of work easier to achieve. This book does not attempt to give you that skill. While this is a decent work for a beginner, I have to question the term ""magic""."
4,good book,"i liked this book. the only problem is that it is not basic reading, is is somewhat complex. but, it is worth the money."
1,Thank God,"Thank my lucky stars I [...] got it at the library instead. Your tax dollars put to good use. This book is little more than a collection of exercises in the creation of poor results. The ""fur ball"" tutorial is laughable! Motion blur? Why would you put motion blur on a stationary ball of fur? Don't waste your time and money."
4,Great addition to Inside Lightwave 6,"I have to disagree with the negative reviews. This book delivers what it promises. It is a cookbook for some neat effects that goes beyond Inside Lightwave 6. The interface concerns are moot as you can easily switch from L6.5 to L6 to L5.6 interface layouts in L6.5, that is stated clearly in the opening of the book. This book is a launchpad for ideas and exploration, not a ticket to Lightwave mastery. It never claims to be anything else. The example scenes on the book are great for tinkering, they can take you beyond the tutorials if you invest some time."
3,correction of review,"In addition of my first review i have to correct my ""totally useless"". This book seems to be quite useful for beginners in the 3d world and i think it also will give this group some experience of magic. My first review was the sound of highend operators critics which is appropriate in a matrix like production environment, but not in public - sorry."
4,Insightful review of Raschenberg's life and work,"I had just read Tomkins exhaustive and excellent biography of Duchamp when I picked up this book to read. This book is very entertaining and eye opening yet not quite the detailed book that he wrote of Duchamp.That said, I would highly recommend you read this book, not just for the insight into Raschenberg's life and art, but also for the detail that Tompkins exercises about the Abstract Expressionist movement among others, and the contemporary artists whom Raschenberg interacted with during his time in New York."
5,Highly Recommended!,"H. James Harrington, Glen D. Hoffherr and Robert P. Reid argue that creativity is not reserved for the few. Rather, it is a skill all humans can develop - if they are willing to step back from their day-to-day routines and focus on their inner lives. This book is a mind-altering system. It is packed with quotes, cartoons, graphs, and exercises to help individuals and organizations realize their creative potential. If the writing seems redundant at times, it is only because the authors want you to be able to open the book anywhere and learn something quickly - and you can. We [...] recommend this book and its CD-ROM package to high-level managers looking to shake things up in the office or in their personal lives. But lower-level employees who want to move up in the world will benefit from it as well."
2,Wrong Gasket!,"I have the Fagor pressure fryer model and mistakenly ordered this gasket. The correct gasket for the pressure fryer (Pro-Selections, Pressure Magic and Magic Chef models) is NOT a hoop but rather an open ended length of silicon tubing. I was not able to find it on Amazon. Amazon of course handled the return without hassle."
4,Quality pressure cooker seal/ but.....,This is a great seal for your Fagor pressure cooker but after reading numerous feedbacks about how to properly fit your pressure cooker seal this item was the one to fit my out of business Ultrex Innova 8 qt pressure cooker but to my dismay it did not. Sadly I have been unable to use my pressure cooker but the seal looked strong and well made.
2,Wrong Size,"Package is good but what I need is 9"". Can't do the replacement on web. Have to return and make a new deal."
1,Wrong part number!,It was the wrong part number for my pressure cooker. I called customer service and told them what I had and was told that was the correct number to which I replied it was too big. The rep then told me to call Fagor customer service which I did and got the correct part number. I called Goodmans again and a second rep told me they did not have the gasket in stock and to send the wrong 1 back. When I asked for a return authorization I was told to just write on the receipt that it was the wrong part and send it back. I took it to the post office and paid to have it sent back and my account has still not been credited for the purchase.Fagor America is the only company I will deal with from now on as when I called them back I got the correct part and got it quicker and the customer rep was very helpful.
2,pressure cooker gasket,"My Fagor pressure cooker lid measures 10 inches in diameter. I ordered this gasket, which states it is for 10"" diameter lids. However, the gasket itself measures 10 3/4"". It is too big for the 10"" lid."
3,Measure before you buy.,"Not all Fagor Splendid models use a 10"" gasket. I bought this based on that review statement and it is entirely incorrect. My 6 Quart Splendid model uses a 9 inch gasket, not 10"".Turn you lid upside down and measure the outside diameter of the metal, not the gasket. If it's about 9 3/4"", then a 10"" gasket WILL NOT FIT. You need the 9"" gasket instead."
2,Wrong size for me,"It looked to me like this size gasket would work on all Fagor pressure cookers smaller than 8-10 quarts, but not so. Mine turned out to use a NINE inch gasket, which isn't available here. I wound up getting one from another source."
3,Disapointed,"Had to send the first one back. After a short time, it developed several pits on the cooking surface. Nothing we did could account for them. It's as if there were voids in the metal. Contacted Calphalon and they sent me a DHL shipping label for product return.I expected the best of both worlds .... non-stick and a hard surface, but food sticks on this pan like other non-teflon pans. My wife managed to scratch the surface of the first one trying to free sticking corned beef hash."
5,Love this activity book,"This activity book is equally matched to the narrative book. The hands-on activities are exciting, easy, fun, appropriate to the portion of history they represent. I'm so glad the author/editor did this work for me/us."
4,Great History for Children!,This is a great basic history for children. I really like how it starts at the beginning of the world instead of starting somewhere in the middle.
3,Not sold on this volume,"I'm surprised that this gets such great reviews, honestly. The coloring pages really are poorly done -- they sincerely do look sloppily traced. And the maps... ay, ay, ay, the maps are confusing. For example, the child is told to color Egypt light red, but there's no delineation to show Egypt's boundary lines. I had to find other maps online to show my daughter what the area covers. The regions being studied should be obvious and not a, ""Well, maybe it goes this far over?""The activities do tend to be busy work, sadly. I had so many high hopes for this, and I had a daughter who was shouting, ""I love history!!!"" But now I'm seeing that enthusiasm seriously fade. :/ I'll likely be going another route for history in the very near future."
2,Unnecessary.,"The only thing we've gotten from the additional workbook that is not in the textbook are review questions. The coloring pages are a little lame and if you know somebody to borrow the workbook from then you can read about the hands-on crafts (which are good.)It's too bad there are not the review questions at the end of the chapters in the textbook.The textbook is great, though. My kid loves the reading, review questions and hands-on crafts from this great homeschooling history curriculum."
5,AWESOME!!! I can't imagine doing histroy without it!!,"The Activity Guide compliments SOTW beautifully!! My first graders can't wait to do history. And I love the review questions and the example narrations. They love the coloring pages and the map work. Mostly they look forward to the projects. Most of the projects are easy, and do not take much prep time. Being in the grammar stage, it is a great way to do hands-on work while introducing them to new material. They truly understand what a 'cuneiform tablets' is after making their own. I am so thankful for this book. I believe this book is a start of a life-long interest in history. Thank you Susan Wise Bauer."
5,Great for our family,"Great book, a must if you are using the Story of the World Book. Comes with lists of other books to read for more in depth study, hands on crafts and projects for kids of all ages. We just did the first activity of a mock archeological dig and my kids loved it (ages 6, 4, and 2). Having fun while learning at the same time? Who would've thought it was possible!"
1,I should havedone more research before I bought this book,"I ordered this book based on reviews and because my daughters were taking the class at co op. I should have read through the entire book before I decided to have it incorporated into our schooling. There is some very through and interesting history in this book. however this book has ALOT of legends. If you are concerned about your children developing a biblical world view I would be extremely cautious with this style of teaching. Older children who have formed a solid biblical worldview can understand and discern much better then younger children. Teaching truth one week and legends the next is mixing two things I don't think are meant to be mixed. What stood out to my children was not the history of the Isreal, which is woven into the book, but the legends of a man who was have man half bull who ate children. so needless to say it is not for us."
4,Must Have,You must have the Activity Book if you are going to use SoTW. There are some fun activity's that we did - like build the pyramid - a must and easy too.There are also tons of extra books recommend to read. Most of them were at our local library so it is not like you will have to spend any extra money on purchasing extra books.
3,Good ideas but they should have hired an artist,"I really liked the ""Story of the World"" volume and eagerly ordered this activity book to go with it. There are good activity ideas in this volume but the coloring pages and other graphics could have been drawn by a 3 year old. For the price, which is more than I would have paid if I had seen it, I expected a quality product. I guess if you are using it for an older child and don't care about the graphics it is a good resource for someone who just wants quick ideas and doesn't want to research their own. However, I don't think the original volume ""Story of the World"" would be that great for an older child so you end up with activities for one age group and text for another. If I wouldn't be out shipping both ways I would return this book. I highly recommend that you view it somewhere before purchasing."
2,Curriculum is a disappointment...,"This series is sadly lacking in Biblical content, and we were left wondering to whom Ms. Bauer is marketing it? It's our opinion that Jesus is presented as a good person and other religions as a semi-valid option. If you are searching for solid Biblical curriculum that intertwines Biblical and World History I would advise you to look elsewhere."
4,Incredible voice,I always loved Marie-Denise since her start. This album shows how different she is from all the other Quebec artists. She has a pure voice and a sense of doing things differently... Doing what she wants to do. If you like classical music and want to really hear someone sing like an angel... This is the album for you.
5,Tasty collection of spices,This is a very robust spice mix. It's excellent with virtually any vegetable(s). My wife who is a vegetarian loves this stuff. It has a very strong flavor (spicy) that might take some getting used to unless you enjoy Indian food already. I've added some fresh garlic when frying with vegetables for an even tastier mix.
5,Ligion rocks!,"The moment I put the CD in my car I couldn't take it out. Every song on this album rocks and will get stuck in your head in a matter of minutes. If you're looking for a fresh new sound in the rock scene, look no further than Ligion."
5,Favorite Papercrafting Book,This has been the best papercrafting book I have found. I am getting a copy for my mother as I can not part with mine. It is well organized and has Tons of ispiring ideas. A must have in my paper crafting library!
3,good looking!,"I was really excited to get this book because it has great, great ideas, but it is not for someone who doesn't have a good background in crafting. You have to know the techniques that they use because it isn't listed out for you. However, the pictures are great and there are some really neat cards, etc. in the book."
4,Card making and Stamping Book,"This book I found when I search for the book the Joy of Card Making. This is a nice supplement and goes by themes like Birthday, Holidays etc. Good ideas and information on how to create the cards. Another book I frequently use to get ideas."
3,Gorgeous Art Deco atmosphere almost makes up for tepid comedy,"Dated but fun film - this was the kind of Hollywood hokum produced to appeal to the Depression-weary audience. This is a lightweight version of Norma Shearer's ""The Divorcee"" (in addressing the infidelity of the male character), dressed up in MGM Art Deco deluxe, with the gorgeously attired Joan Crawford and suave Robert Montgomery. No depth here, but just sit back and enjoy the atmosphere."
2,This is only half of the movie,"This is a fairly well done movie that shows just how hard Charlie Chaplin's growing up years were. The movie shows his family falling apart and him nearly living on the street most of the time. The acting is well done and there are some humorous parts in it.One odd thing about this movie is that the package says it is 60 minutes long when it is actually at least an hour and a half. The movie is suddenly cut off at the end with the words ""To be continued"". As the words disappear and the tape stops you feel like you spent an hour and a half watching only half of the movie. They apparently were planning to make a part two. As far as I can tell they never did. Because of this fact I would not recommend this movie to most people."
5,No Modern Romance,"One thing you have to take into consideration when reading this book is the time it was written in - when you take your head out of the modern day way of thinking and let yourself go back to a time when you didn't outwardly speak about occluded designs, yet Dion did so more than many people would have liked. She was also very good at superimposing that which is only seen to those who wish to see or whom are seeking it. It may seem like a sappy romance novel by the title but it's nothing of the sort. Actually, I've read some sappy romance novels, albeit very few as they are not my style, and this book has nothing of a formulae to compare to those ""types"" of books. It's obvious to me why this book was written with the title it was given, it catches your attention.I enjoyed picking out the details."
4,Very cute,This coaster is adorable. Comes with a nice bow and positive sayings written on the outside of the frame. Love it.
4,Great little gift,"The coasters are a good size, come with a pretty bow and are good quality. I plan to put my daughters pictures in them and give them as little gifts to grandmas."
4,Excellent cookbook!,"If you're looking for easy to make, delicious vietnamese dishes, this is it. The recipes are easy to follow and the results are surprisingly good. Excellent book for those who like experimenting in their kitchen and who enjoy the taste of authentic vietnamese cuisine."
5,Looks & fits awesomely well!,"So beautiful! You would (almost) not know if faux fur! It fits so well and is so warm! I would buy another one if there were another color! Can't beat the price, too!"
4,Does Acorn have another girl he likes?,"Anna loves Acorn more than anything in the world, but when another girl with celebral pasly is in Wiggins is afraid of all horses exept Acorn she doesn't know what to do. First Acorn does a new trick for her, then she comes up better ideas for a face painting booth. What will happen? Read the book."
4,I loved the book!,Anna loves her pony Acorn and always spends time with him. Then a new girl with cerebral palsy comes into Wiggins and she's going to take riding lessons on Acorn. Anna feels like Acorn is not her pony anymore. And Pam and Lulu like the girl. Also the girl is a great artist. Anna thinks that the girl is better at drawing than her. Do the Pony Pals think that the girl is a better artist than Anna? And does Acorn like the girl more than Anna? Read this book and find out! Highly recommended!
3,Interesting Stories,Functional Recipes! Some of them are very unique to the region and hard to find elsewhere.
5,Dishes from the Wild Horse Desert,"Love this book for its recipes and short stories. My great-grandparents, grand-parents and father were from this part of Texas, so many of the recipes are a slight variation from what my Mom would cook for my dad. How did she know how to cooks this way? I never asked and I should have. This is my third copy of the book. I send it to my kids when they ask me for a receipe. I live in South West Texas now and the Mexican food here on the border is entirely differnt. Thank for the fast shipping! Jayne"
4,"Great pan, but ...","I looked at several paella pans and their reviews before buying this one. Most were inordinately expensive. I have a carbon steel paella pan, but it is just too much hassle to take care of; last time I pulled it out it was completely rusted and unuseable, although I had seasoned it well and it had a protective coat on it. This Fagor pan requires no extra care other than what you would provide any nonstick pan. I have made many, many paellas by now, and the pan has held up well. I have also used it for many other cooking tasks. My only advise is to note that because it is nonstick, it cannot tolerate oven heat in excess of ~450 degress, and no way can it be used in a grill as is called for in a truly authentic paella. I also think the nonstick surface gets in the way of getting a truly authentic crusted bottom. However, for the price, this is a great pan for starters."
2,Not same pan as in the picture!!,"The paella pan in the picture has thick handles. If you click on the picture to zoom in you will notice that the picture changes to a different paella pan with thinner handles (look closely) - that's the one I got. The pan in the main picture seems thicker than the one I received. The one I got is not ultra thin but it certainly isn't super sturdy. If I didn't have to pay for shipping (again) I'd return it.... I guess the people that wrote good reviews got a different [and better] pan than I did. On another note, there are two small circles where the non-stick coating is worn out - as in I can see the metal underneath the coating. The pan doesn't look used, I think it was damaged/scratched before it was packaged. I hope others aren't as unlucky as I was and receive something of better quality."
3,Nontraditional paella pan,"While this is a fine looking pan and well sized, the nonstick coating is not trustworthy, it easily scratches using conventional utensils and isn't traditionally Spanish. Paella is properlly made in pottery or iron pans."
1,"pompous, reactionary and clumsy",This exceedingly pompous critic is no match for the classics of the genre. Stick to Kobbe or Grove.
5,the best all round camino book?,"This was the first book I read about the Camino and it remains, more than a decade and 40 similar texts later, still one of the very best such. If one is to read a single straightforward journal account I can think of no better introduction to the subject.For my recent compilation of pilgrimage quotations (""Ultreia! Onward! Progress of the Pilgrim"") I read all 40 or so contemporary English journal accounts available about the various routes. Stanton's is clearly within the first grouping of 8 or so best such books (i.e. largely those written by established authors and/or academics). And Stanton is immensely quotable; indeed, with 20 such abstracted for my review volume Ultreia!, the Road of Stars to Santiago was the single most quoted text of all."
2,Huh?,I find it interesting that the product description says absolutely nothing about the plum preserves it is supposed to be describing.
1,"Ok phone, but deceptive features","The phone is ok. A little slow actually. Bluetooth is useless unless you plan on forking over $50 for an earpiece. The main reason I got this phone is for third party applications (like ssh, instant messaging, etc.). These were necessary for my job.However, this ""unlimited blackberry plan"" does not cover data access for these applications. See blackberry for more info on this issue. Cingular requires that you purchase an additional plan to get these apps to work! Something not mentioned here. Cingular support regarding this problem is contradicting, ignorant, and outright misleading.Save your time and your money, go with another provider."
1,Cannot Recommend 7290,"I would not recommend this phone. I bought mine used on Ebay because I thought Blackberry was a good product. It worked fine for about 2 weeks and now it chronically drops calls and says there is no service. I don't know if this is the fault of T-Mobile, my carrier, or not. I put my SIM card in another phone and it shows 5 bars.The address book is really clunky. It takes too many steps to get where you want.The web page support does not seem to answer many questions.You need a ""patch"" to fix the Daylight Savings Time problem with the calendar."
1,"Great Phone, Mediocre Customer Service","This is a GREAT device. But I was so unhappy with Cingular Wireless, I decided to send it back during the 30-day return period. I used to be with T-Mobile. The coverage wasn't the greatest for me, but the customer service was 5 star. I will put up with some minor coverage issues to have great customer service. Cingular may have a bigger network, but they need to serve their customers better."
3,Accidental disconnections,"I am still learning all the 'wonderful' things that the Blackberry 7290 can do. For right now, I am using it mostly as a cell phone and to get email.What I find annoying is the design of the trackwheel and side button. The side button -- which disconnects a phone call -- happens to be right where I would normally hold the phone. Result: I often inadvertently disconnect a call. Very maddening!"
3,Feels like a freesbee in your pants,"As a phone it sucks: big, uncomfortable... I remember with nostalgia my little old Nokia, and the fact that I could type a number and make a call with one hand and my eyes closed.As an e-mailer: it has become a necessity for me. The fact that it's synchronized with my Outlook e-mail and calendar makes it indispensable. Super handy in airports and business travel.Just learn to live with it!"
2,Same voice problems,"The same review above. This is my second phone where gradually over time people stopped hearing me even though I had full signal strength. I took out the battery with the power on- waited 30 secs and it seems to work, we'll see..."
2,Arrggggh to Cingular Wireless,"I share the experience of the previous consumer who tried to upgrade phones and switch from AT&T to Cingular. I, too, had to call Cingular more than a dozen times and call both AT&T and Cingular, even though they are purportedly the same company. They could not have made the experience more taxing or less pleasant. Every problem I encountered was my fault, not theirs . . . and I've been an AT&T Wireless subscriber for more than 6 years. I'm switching companies. Great merger, guys."
3,Just sticks,These are fine rhythm sticks. Paint comes off onto anything is gets banged against. So watch out for that with younger kids.
3,"Not bad, but thin","I bought these claves to add to my collection of Puerto Rican musical instruments for my holiday parties. While they are fine- and the fluted one adds some variety- the sticks are thin and so they don't make a deep sound, it's more high-pitched. I also bought the Meini wood claves also through Amazon and much prefer them, but for the price these are a fine addition to my collection."
2,I was not thrill about this at all.,I did not like Grover 3277 Rhythm Stick Pair with One Plain and One Fluted I was not happy with them at all.
5,Need the refills! ;),"Window Arts is great--very creative and fun for the kids. You go through a lot of black ink (to outline), so getting the refills is highly recommended."
2,stale,"My kids love this product. However, it is quite pricey and about half of the plastic bottles were clogged and the paint is fairly dry. It seems that it stayed on a shelf in a warehouse for quite a while. The manufacture should have a production and/or use-by date."
4,Fun,"This is a refill for the window art kit. The whole family has had fun with this. We have made things to go with the theme of each child's room and put them on their dresser mirrors and windows. They come off easily. They are a little messy to make. My children kept forgetting to use ""just a little, but overall worth it."
5,Hours of fun!,"My kids love to make window art.Now I have to get more paints.It's easy, safe, and creative.Doesn't stain and easy to peel off and place on another window."
3,wish it was as good as the originials,"We have had a great time with the Window Art set but have had some problems with the black paint in the refill - runny paint, air bubbles. The other colors are great. Just don't understand why the black isn't true to the original."
5,GREAT COLORS - LOADS OF WINDOW CLINGS,"This is a refill for the Klutz Window Art book. This set has more colors, including white and clear, plus TWO tubes of black outline. You can create more colors and effects with these additional tubes. This craft is a favorite in our home!"
2,Production description is wrong,"It claims the package contains two 40-ml bottles of black outline paint, ten 22-ml of colored paint. When I received the package, it really contains two 20-ml bottles of black outline paint, ten 12-ml of colored paint. Basically I got half of what they are claiming. Otherwise the product is fine just less than what they are advertising."
5,Hours of fun for home or classroom,I bought it for my classroom to use with the after school club. I gave them different patterns to trace over with the black (pattern under a transparency or laminate film) and then color it in. Great window clings or clings for almost anything..even lockers.

3,COMPARED TO HIS OTHER WORKS THIS WAS PASSIVE,"This story was about a young girl that was in an orphange and had to deal with a lot at a young age.

5,Excellent devotional,"I already purchased the book earlier, but bought this one for my mother. It arrived in good condition, timely, and it's an excellent daily devotional."
4,Highly Entertaining!,"If you are looking for a quick read, this book is for you. I finished this book in 2 days! Ofcourse, I had lots of fun reading it! It just shows that life is short and live it to the fullest.Maya is absolutely entertaining and how she falls for Tahir is quite cute. Read this book and you won't be disappointed!"
4,fun fluffy beach read!,"Maya and Tahir ~ matchmade or not? Funny story about finding the goddess within and having Starbucks coffee while you're at it. There's humor, a touch of mystery and matchmaking made fun."
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Read,I thought this book was written by a twelve year old! It was just too easy to read because it was very poorly written. The author had many sad attempts to be funny that only left me sighing in disgusting. It took me about 2 hours to read this book because I couldn't wait for it to end! As soon as I finished the book I threw it in the trash. A complete waste of my $5.99!!
4,What fun,"A terrific adventure. Unlikely and silly as the premise may be it is completely wonderful. Here is a book that embraces all the cliches of chick lit- coffee drinking shopaholic heroine in need of a purpose, a handsome hero who hides his true feelings to the end - and yet isn't made stale by them. This is a very fresh story with a completely engaging set of supporting characters. Loved it."
4,Asma (TX),"I read this book on a 5hr airplane ride - I found myself laughing outloud numerous times! The book is an easy read, and the story line will keep your interest. I found it hard to put the book down - in fact, I didn't. A good read if you're lookin for something light and comedic."
2,Could not get into this one.,"I felt that the writer tried too hard to be hip, cool and funny and because of this, it was difficult to read this book. I found myself searching for the next ""excruciatingly contrived hip, cool phrase""; thereby I wasn't concentrating on the storyline."
4,A good read,"The book, although not very realistic, is a complete hoot. Very witty, charming, and fun. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something light and fun to read. I laughed from beginning to end."
2,"Tries hard, accomplishes little","This author tries hard to be funny, occassionally she succeeds, however, where she really fails is creating a character who is likeable and relatable. As an young Indian American I can't relate to the main character at all. I don't even know anyone like her. She's spoiled, selfish and not very interesting. Her relationship with Tariq isn't even realistic, not that the main premise of the book is either."
1,There's better Indian Chick-Lit Out There,"Ugh, from the beginning I knew this wasn't going to be a deep read, but I didn't expect it to be so flat. The main character is struggling with being single while her family is trying to set her up with eligible men from India, but runs into more trouble when she realizes she's an incarnation of a goddess. Could have been amusing if the main character weren't so unlikeable--she's arrogant, irresponsible, and thinks she's the greatest thing ever. Not to mention spoiled and just boring. The book was pretty forgettable. The storyline was a stretch and wasn't really all that funny. Like another reviewer remarked, maybe if I were a 13 year old it would have been somewhat enjoyable."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This is a terrible book. Poorly written, the unlikable protagonist comes off as a spoiled sixteen-year-old rather than a thirty year old woman. Don't waste your money or your time- look somewhere else for entertainment."
3,Very fun read,"As others have said, this isn't literature, but it sure is fun! It's witty, a bit silly and exciting. I actually ended up liking the main character. Sure, the Indian-American aspects are somewhat exaggerated, but so what - it's fiction. Right? Isn't it? It'd be pretty cool if it wasn't, actually.I've enjoyed her other books, too. She's sassy, ironic and wry - the author, that is. I hope she write more books!"
3,Recomended,"I found this book very interesting. It opened my eyes to a wide gammet of possibilities even though not all of them applied to me personally. At times the content deviated from that implied by the title, but it was always connected in some way. I would would recomend this book to anyone considering improvement of their financial position in life."
5,Makes you think,"I just loved reading Orphaned at 39. It made me think about my parents evolving health situation. Their health is steadily changing, mostly in a negative way, as they age. In the coming years, what will that mean for them? And what will that mean for me?This marvelous book helped me to answer many of the questions that adult children will face as their parents become aged and require some level of adult care. It also assisted me with understanding that there are lots of resources available to people who need help, both the elderly and the care-givers.I think everyone should read this book."
5,A wonderful journey through life's ups and downs.,"I really enjoyed this book.I normally read sports biographies or books on travel. However, my wife gave me Orphaned at 39 after she had finished it, and am I ever glad she did.This book is a true story, and has everything; marvelous friendships, traitors, good times, bad times, and an incredibly devoted son who cares for his dad.This book is a tear-jerker, but I would recommend it to those who love to read about devotion, courage and people doing the ""right thing""."
5,The BIBLE for Star Wars Toy Collectors!,"This is the best Star Wars book I've seen that specifically focuses on collectibles such as action figures, playsets, and dolls. It has so much detail on each and every individual figure, including their weapons, accessories, and all the cards they were released on. The separate photos of their weapons are extremely helpful! Every photo is in color and very accurate. The book contains a lot of history and unique information about the movies and their characters. This is definetly a must have for any collector. Check it out!"
4,It is a very informative book.,"I really think that this book is very informative. It gives you very detailed information about the prices of star wars action figures. It's completely accurate 98% of the time! A very good buy, if you really want good information about collecting the figures."
3,its alright for star wars,"i like the bounty hunter wars better,like the mandalorian armor,and slave ship."
1,Steve Sansweet is selling us out.,"If Amazon allowed me to give this book no stars, I would. Do not be fooled."
1,The Pleasure to Remain so Artless,"You can put this band in line with the rest of the B-rate Warped Tour bands who can't write or sing or play music to a level worthy of having a CD. This is some of the most repetitive guitar playing I have heard in a ""Rock"" band. With some improved lyrics and a decent guitar player, this band may have a chance of surviving more than a couple of years. Either way, whatever Kane Hodder was going to do for the music scene, its arleady been done, which was waste people's time when they could have been listening to real music. Fall Out Boy sucks too."
4,Great Learning Dictionary,"A little hard to navigate the dictionary ,but with time, you do get what word or words you want from it"
