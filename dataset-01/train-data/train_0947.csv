5,Capturing the Spirit of Chinese Brush Painting,"What a delightful treat for painters of all stages!!! Nan Rae's book is a very lively and spiritual work that draws you to her obvious passion for her art. I'm a beginning painter and have bought several brush painting books. The Ch'i of the Brush is a very dedicated book with beautiful illustrations that are easy to follow-her directions and explanations make you feel that she were giving you the lessons right in your own home!! This book gives you an exciting confidence and enthusiasm for the art that makes you want to learn all that you can do. The histories and works included are very appreciating and thorough--very interesting to read. Plus, the most beautiful part--Nan Rae's wonderful illustrations and paintings are displayed page after page and her happy spirit lifts right off of those pages!! If you could pick only one book on Chinese Brush painting, this is definitely the one to have."
1,Weak Painting Techique Misleads Students,"While I admire the author's cheerful energy, I am very disappointed by her attempts at Chinese brush painting. The key to all oriental painting is the power of the strokes. Nan Rae's strokes are weak and lack courage. It is saddening when students are misled by a glossy 'how-to' book. Several of Nan Rae's illustrations are poor copies from books such as the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Chinese Brush Painting, a classical 'how-to' book that has endured for centuries. One of the problems with all 'how-to' books is that students try to imitate the finished result, not understanding that the correct performance and rhythm of the strokes are necessary to achieve their goal. Nan Rae's explanations and encouraging style are well-written; it is a pity that her painting technique does not equal her writing."
2,Not for young children,"I rented this book from the library and my sister read it first to my daughter while babysitting. My daughter informed me the next day that it was quite scary even though it ended ok and that she thought I should read it. I agree with her. The story is about a young child who broke her promise, was almost killed by goblins which led to a new promise which her family had to trick the goblins to get out of. Not a great story and no moral to the story as the 1st broken promise wasn't ever addressed. My daughter is 5 (3 months short of 6) and she felt it was too scary to hear - she asked for it to be returned to the library the next day."
4,Good music for a bad movie,"This is a good set of music from what were largely undiscovered bands at the time. I've never seen the movie, I understand it received terrible ratings. Unlike the movie, the music is good. I got to see Dead Leonard live in the '90s. Good band, though admittedly, not my favorite song by them. Wish I could find more of their stuff."
5,magnifique!,"Very, very good! great view, no straining for clarity - I made the right choice here! Great Value!"
2,Poor Sound,Volume of sound was not high enough. I sold it to one of my friends for 1/2 of what I gave for it. Went back to my old H720. Not happy with it. Ray
1,horrible headset...don't buy,"First one wouldn't charge..sent it back...second one sounded like complete crap and the people on the receiving end could hear themselves echoing back. The echo I discovered, came from the earpiece volume making its way to the mic. Avoid this thing at all costs."
2,Didn't last long,I've had it for less than a month and it's already pooped out and stopped working. I don't know why. It was great for the first couple weeks though!
1,Barely audible,If you are a rhinocerous (with hearing 20X better than a human's) then this product is for you. I found the speaker to be worthlessly insufficient even on it's max setting. The rest is OK and it charges on a standard Motorola 2-prong charger but the speaker makes it basically worthless
1,it worked for 1 week,it worked for 1 week and then stopped charging the battery and now I have a piece of junck
3,Original and eerie,"This is a movie that producers know would not much moolah. It stars small time actors and has little going for it, other than plot. However, Bigas Luna uses this and adds a good dose of stylization that makes this sleeper better than the average flick. A very good movie that does not have you rolling your eyes (like many cheezy slasher flick tend to do) with it's plot holes and non-comical jokes."
5,THE Greatest Movie of All-Time!!!,"Buy or borrow this movie, watch it over and over again until the anguish becomes pure joy. Then make copies and push them down the throats of everyone you come into contact with. Do not accept any payment/reimbursement of any kind except an invitation to watch this masterpiece's hypnotic magic flow through your senses. Compare and contrast this gem of a flick to any ""classic"" and it will blow it away."
3,AN EYE FOR AN EYE,"A middle-aged momma's boy runs rampant in a movie theater cutting out patron's eyeballs, while the movie onscreen depicts the same man as an optometrist who is driven to his evil acts by his overbearing, overweight squeaky-voiced mother. (The film's movie-within-a-movie THE MOMMY).An interesting idea is well played out even if the end result is rather awkward. There is one funny scene of one of the victim's slobbering before having his throat slit with a scalpel. Presumably it's just a matter of taste. All in all, ANGUISH isn't a bad movie, I just expected it to be a lot better."
4,just plain clever,i went into this movie not expecting much and found that it was a clever piece of horror which is best experienced without reading the plot. well worth an experience.
2,Weird,"This movie was definatley weird. To sum it up it is a movie about a guy killing people while they are watching a movie about a guy killing people while they are watching a movie about dinosaurs killing people. Soud strange? Well it is. Just watch it to completly understand. It was in the making of a good B movie, but then it just dragged on. But it was decent"
2,A Bit Different,"This hypnotic horror film from 1986 is for the movie fan with a different taste. The cheap blood and guts scenes are worse off because of the roller coaster movements. The interesting but nauseating movements of the camera are intense if you&#65533;re stuck in the eighties. In my opinion they could have cut the fat and made this a short 30 min. T.V. show. One plus is that it&#65533;s a little freaky which makes it scary to a degree. The other plus is it get boring when you give up trying to understand the movie in a movie concepts they intend to entice you with. I watched this with my girlfriend so when she got bored with the movie or somehow scared by the odd images, I was there to hold."
2,Made in china means a bad thing in this case....,"Don't be fooled by the name and the mark ""Spain"" on the blade. The blade got nicked in two places after I cut a cob of corn. I have two knives for more than 2 years and they were really made in Spain . They don't have a single nick yet ! Next time I'll better spend twice as much and buy original Henckels knife which is made in Germany."
3,It's a nice knife under this price.,I bought this knife for my wife and she's satisfied w/ it as well. a light and sharp knife.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this knife for $35.00 at linens and things. I vacillated between this and the $80 version. I made a mistake. When the knife was finally extricated from it's mega-vinyl prison. I hefted it, felt the edge and examined construction. I got less than I paid for. The feel and look of this knife is similar to those late night TV special knives. ""But wait, there's more... Now how much would you pay?""It is just a cheap feeling product. Also, the tip of the knife had a pronounced burr on it that I had to hone off.I am too old to be re-learning that you get what you pay for."
4,The Monks of War: The Military Religious Orders,"A thorough introduction and considering the amount of substantive content, pretty readable, as most of this author's books tend to be. The main problem is that sometimes he tells of a series of events involving many players over a few pages. The references to the different players are very confusing and often it is unclear who did it what so the sequence of events makes no sense on a first or even second reading. The change in pace between passages which are detailed down to the armour used and passages which gallop through narrative in this very confusing manner is unpredictable and choppy.However the detail, whenever it is provided, is of gripping human interest. Altogether, a book that is well worth the effort required."
4,Highly Readabe,This scholarly and well-documented from original sources book is written in impeccable English by a dignified scholar.
3,if you are a scholar then this may be for you,"There are different types of history book. There are those written for the casual person, and those written for people who are really into the topic. This book is NOT for people who are casually interested in knights, and the crusades, etc. I found the book to be dry, dull and boring. in my mind it is a list of names, dates, and events scrubbed clean of anything that could be ""fun"" to read. If you are like me, and casually interested in the crusades and the holy orders, then skip this book, it is not written for us. But if you are a person who is really into the topic, then i really think you would like this book because it is well researched, comprehensive, and really covers everything a person into the topic would want to know. So whether or not you will enjoy this book depends on how you feel about the crusades."
4,fabulous music,company delivered speedily. album loved ...it's a great version..but not quite as good as original....some of the theatre had been taken away in the sound..for me just a tad clinical the original was better...but I will be listening to this CD for many years to come
5,A new world,War of the world that you should hear. Once again a twist on an old story.First herd this in a trip in Europe years ago.
5,war of the worlds,"Bought this for my Dad's birthday, he loved it. I used to hear it as a kid on record. It is a wonderful adaption of the original war of the worlds on the radio, but had a little modernization and songs. It's just fun if it's your cup of tea."
4,"""Disco Martians"" a classic period piece","""War of the Worlds,"" which my wife and I have called ""Disco Martians"" for decades, is a classic from the ""progressive rock"" school that gave us Yes, Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Supertramp, Queen and David Bowie (among others). It's a late example of the genre, so the beat is disco. But it's got all the pretension, and all of the flash, that this period in rock was famous for, and that punk (as well as disco) rebelled against. More important, it's still listenable 20 years later, even danceable."
4,Interesting,"Fun to listen to, especially if you have seen the original movie of the same title. My favorite song on the album/cd is Forever Autumn. To me, this makes the purchase worth it by itself. The rest of the music is icing on the cake. Overall, a good selection to spend the evening with."
2,What was the point of this project???,"I recieved this album as a gift at Christmas in 1980. I was a fan of UK progressive rock and the person who bestowed this gift upon me thought that this would be right up my alley. Don't get me wrong, some of the music is good, but that disco beat HAS TO GO!!!!. The unfortunate thing about the album is that despite some decent music, the whole concept is utterly stupid!!! HG Wells ""War of the Worlds"" as a rock opera concept album??? I think that calls for a: what the hell were you thinking Jeff Wayne??? When critics look back on the UK prog scene of the 70's and mock it as self indulgent egotistical nonsense, this is the kind of album they are referring to. This is an interesting album to own, and definitley an enigmatic piece of progressive rock history, but the disco beat and the ""ooooo laaaas"" just make me laugh when I hear it now. If Joey Ramone was a spy, and he was captured by the KGB, this is the album they would use to get him to talk."
3,I remembered it better than this,"Like another reviewer, I dug out my vinyl and copied it over to my computer after seeing the Speilberg movie. I remembered how much I liked the album as I heard the opening bars again. But then.....disco hell takes over. The basic musical theme is great, Richard Burton really brings the story to life, but the constant disco beat really dates it. Maybe the remixes get rid of the disco beat??"
5,Too bad I can't give this ten stars,"This album is superb, and just the thing for those who like rock opera and the old-style radio dramas. Each time I play this album (I have a copy on 2 vinyl LPs from way back) the images and the characters come alive in my head. For those who haven't read the book (you HAVE read the book, haven't you?) this makes an excellent introduction. I would love to hear Jeff Wayne's take on some other sci-fi classics."
5,EXCELLENT CD,"This CD is much better, sound-wise, than the audio tape version I purchased many years ago. The sound and production quality is superb.I'm not sure why they added the beginning of Part 1 to the end of Part 2. It is redundant."
4,Had the vinyl,Had the Vinyl wanted CD. First Heard it in Germany in 1978. Waiting to see if DVD ever comes out in US version as my DVD player does not play Pal. Wonder if they will tour the stage Version in US? The extended version 30th added new meaning to Techno.
4,Entertaining,"A treat for the ears! We play it on Halloween! The music is well done, and the narrator does an excellent job. Very outlandish music."
3,Alright abduction,"Sci-prog is about half gimmicky cheese, and two quarters technically proficient/inspired fluidity."
5,War of the Worlds,The music was incredible and Burton's narration gave us indelible mental images! We actually watched the clip on the web and were amazed at the perfection of fitting the music to the action. Fantastic!
4,A great listen,"An old friend of mine introduced me to this album, and it's definitely an awesome experience. I have no way to describe this album other than a fusion of Welles story, Richard Burton's cool english dialog, funky 70's music and creepy sound effects. If you've never heard it it's worth the time: the dialog and music all work perfectly together. I can't imagine Burton's dialog by itself (it would put you to sleep by itself) and the music without the dialog would just have a corny 70's feel after awhile. But all the elements together make for an excellent album well worth listening to."
5,A musical/dramatic masterpiece,"I first heard this while in high school and was mesmorized by it. With Richard Burton's penetrating voice, Jeff Wayne's explosion of musical genius, the touching vocals of Justin Hayward and Julie Covington, and, not to be overlooked, the wonderful adaptation of the Wells classic by Wayne's late wife, Doreen, (who died only 3 years after its release)this is a masterwork to be savored again and again and shared with everyone you know. Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
3,"Great Album, but Dreadful Sound on CD Layer","As I don't (yet) have an SACD player I can't vouch for the SACD layer, but I can say that the stereo remix on the CD layer is dreadful - it sounds terribly artificial and lacking in air. I can't help but wonder if they deliberately did it this way to make the SACD layer sound better. Anyway, if you don't have an SACD player then get the 2000 20-bit remaster while you still can.As for the music, this is IMHO a true classic and one of the top 10 albums of the 70s. It could so easily have been unbearably cheesy, but somehow they pull it off, and the result is a genuine masterpiece."
5,War Of The Worlds,I had searched for this particular CD for years in India and was delighted to find it on Amazon! Amazing clarity of digital sound took me back to when I had first heard it 25 years ago
3,A Million to One,"For a double disc set lasting 2 hours it's a shame that there's only 2 good tracks between them. 'The Eve of the War' (and it's remix) is the track that everybody knows and loves. It's truly great music and both tracks last for quite a while, fully exercising the brilliant theme. Richard Burton's narration works wonderfully well blended into these tracks but on the rest of the tracks the story seems out of order and boring.I got this set for dirt cheap so it wasn't such a big deal forking over the dough for it. Like I said there are only 2 good tracks and even though they are super cool paying full price for them is a little steep."
3,not all i'd hoped for,"i bought this on a verbal recommendation from a guy i hardly know - we were speaking of rick wakemans ""journey to the centre of the earth"" when he mentioned ""war of the worlds"" - i think this would've made for a great single album (disc) - it's a bit 'stretched out' ~ dont get me wrong - it's good - but the drumwork has the indellible mark of disco on it - and there is no orchestration to speak of - all synthesizers - if you're looking for a classic narrative set to progressive rock music ~ try wakemans ""journey to the centre of the earth"" (and overlook the flat vocals on it) at least it has full orchestration and due to that it pulls some serious power that is lacking on ""wars of the worlds""all in all this is enjoyable - but not unforgetablepeace out - space puppy"
1,Not quite what i wanted,It was not the one I thought it was. I actually wanted the audio of the actual movie not the sound track.
1,Worst Paul Van Dyk production,"I hate to be negative when discussing PVD as i have a lot of respect for the guy both as a DJ and as a producer. I have enjoyed some superb nights in clubs where he was DJ-ing and i have some serious classic tunes of his in my collection... Forbidden Fruit, Perfect Day, How Much Can You Take, Avenue etc.I don't wish to offend anyone who likes this tune but it is simply rubbish. The vocal is cheesy but the tune itself is very poor also. The Out There and Back album was disappointing compared to Seven Ways but still contained some great moments ( The Love from Above, Avenue, Travelling, Another Way, The Riddle) but i can't fathom what PVD with his underground roots was thinking when he produced this. A blemish on the cv of a normally exceptional artist"
3,Get the Jennifer Brown single instead,"This song was done before as Jennifer Brown's ""Alive."" The original Paul Van Dyke version of this song is pretty sanitary compared to the previous release. Fans of this song should definately check out the Bleachin Club Mix of ""Alive"" as it is more rockin' than PVD's take."
2,weak single for paul van dyk,Stick to the album. Most of the tracks on this single are repetative and the singing gets to be annoying after all 8 songs. Paul's weakest single in a while. I guess it's still a must for any of his fans though. c-
3,"VE KAN BE HEROES, JUSS FOR VON DAY!","Sepulchral and spectral indeed as a previous reviewer said. Add to that: lugubrious, morbid, depressing, but that's Nico! I do not think this is her best album - that honour belongs to The End, Marble Index or Chelsea Girl. The production here is messy (but that may also be considered an advantage by some of her fans!) and the material not up to standard. Except for Heroes and I'm Waiting For My Man which I love. Her version of Heroes is quite impressive in its teutonic grandeur, while Waiting ... swings & rattles along nicely. This album is only for the really devoted."
1,Wrong Item sent,"This is the article I ordered but received a old green Brewers shirt, I am in the process of sending it back. Please send the right one. I ordered a Milwaukee Brewers Navy Mock Turtleneck by Majestic, size medium with the (M) on the collar. The one I am sending back is from 10 years ago the logo is different and this shirt is green."
5,Incredible Book!,"Being a big fan of Tom Savini's incredible work, it has been my dream to own this book. When it arrived today I was dancing up a storm from excitement and couldn't wait to peer inside. Filled with beautiful and incredibly rare black and white and color photos, Tom breakdowns some of his greatest illusions of all time. Inside there are many interesting illustrations, including the Dick Smith Breakdown Prosthetic method used to create Grandpa in Texas Chainsaw Massacre II. For those interested in animatronics, a few shots of the creature from Monkey shines and Tales from the Darkside are great as well. He even shows how to do hairpunching, a tricky business in creating a realistic hairline for props and creatures. All in all, it is a very good book! An excellent resource for those interested in makeup effects and for those morbidly curious out there. Believe me, this is worth the money!!!! GET IT TODAY!!!"
3,Experienced users need not apply,"The majority of the information in this book is oriented towards beginners and novices. For someone new to graphics development and/or new to PSP, this would be an excellent book, but for someone looking for tips on how to create specific special effects using PSP, like the tutorials on the author's web site, don't waste your time. There are only a few effects tutorials covered in the book, and what there are can easily be found for free on the web, simply by starting from the Jasc Development Center. If that's what you're looking for, the author's web site has more free tutorials than the book does.Again, it's an excellent book for beginners and novices to PSP and/or graphic development, but experienced developers looking for special effects would be better off at the author's website."
5,You make the choice - Web page or the book!,"T. Michael Clark' PSP Web Techniques is a great book for those of us who are relatively new to PSP. His book is a great reference to have readily available, he covers just about everything you might want to create to improve the aesthetic appeal to your page. His web page, equally good, does have more and many different tutorials than does his book, so I feel the two together make for a great balance to get you on your way, or to simply use as a reference when some of those little ""tricks"" slip your mind. You won't be disappointed buying the book, and it won't cut you off like some ISP's!"
5,Star Wars E3BF27Mace Windu,"This was also a gift for a great grandson. He seemed quite pleased when he opened the package, and I noticed him playing with it later."
2,Used for parts,"This is an older figure of Mace Windu and hasn't really held up well. Hasbro tried to incorporate ""action features"" such as having Mace swing his arms and twist his waist, but I find these features almost always never work or destroy the integrity of the figure. His arms are a bit looser than they would otherwise be. As for the paint and sculpt, all I can say is that the Vintage version blows this one out of the water. Having said this, I bought the figure primarily as a source of spare parts for my attempt to make a custom Jolee Bindo figure from KOTOR."
4,Hybrid camcoder at affrodable price,Hitachi hybrid cam coder is good. only thing that it does not give goodpictures in house with less light. Else its ok. easy to use. had 30G hard disk and DVDs so you can store video on both.
1,Very unhappy with DZHS500A...,"I actually tried twice to like this camcorder, both times after only a weekend's worth of use, it would not power on. Thankfully Amazon accepts replacement/returns...glad I bought it here. Anyway, the first one I ran by the Hitachi repair shop, and they told me I was blowing fuses. I thought it a fluke, perhaps not, as the replacement did the identical thing. Hitachi would not work with me, so I am shopping for something different, probably Sony."
4,His most well-rounded record...,"This is the first Syd Barrett solo album that I ever got, and while it's not the import with the bonus tracks, this compilation of outtakes is possibly even more disturbing than his true releases. ""Opel"" has to be one of his most haunting and honest songs; this collection also boasts superior versions of songs like ""Wouldn't YOu Miss Me?(Dark Globe)"", acoustic versions of stuff like ""Rats"", and downright delightful fare like ""Dolly Rocker""."
5,Opel,"If you are unsure about Syd Barrett's solo work, but want to start somewhere this is as good a place as any. If you were a fan of ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" most of Barrett's solo work sounds similar. With all of the fun' and whimsical tunes. I would recommend this if you are any kind of a fan of Syd's."
2,I am a Syd Barrett Fans but...,"Syd Barrett is not for everyone, and this record is not for every Syd Barrett Fans. In fact compare to the ""completed work"" in Madcap and Barrett the demos found there are quite under his standard. Of course, Syd Barrett Fans Like me will love the songs like ""Opel"", ""Swan Lee"" and ""Crowns and Jagglers""(Octopus) as well as the incompleted song ""Let's split"" and ""Milky way"". But the biggest Evil is that the closet classics like ""Vegetable Man"", ""Scream thy last Scream"", ""Two of a kind"".. are NOT included here, make this album not quite worth such price. OH..."
1,Opel........Syd Barrett,I wanted to like this but I didn't. It seems to be out-takes of songs that weren't good enough for Floyd or his other albums. One for the hardcore Floyd fans perhaps? Guess I don't qualify!
4,Interesting odd and ends collection of Syd Barrett's work.,"Opel is a collection of unreleased recordings from Syd Barrett, they're either demos, alternate versions or unfinished tracks. Syd was one strange dude and very unperdictable. He would wander into the studio and start playing and would quit without warning. While he was in the studio, the backing members of Soft Machine would hang around and try to play along. But Syd would change chords or notes so often that it became virtually impossible to keep up with him. A collection of Syd Barrett's material was released a few years ago and it uses tracks from all three albums, a definitive collection of music world's most eccentric individual.Recommended for psychedelic music fans."
2,There is no life after Pink Floyd,This is like a psychodelic Barney sing-a-long. I give it 2 start just because I find it amazing that Syd (bless his acidic little mind) can actually rhyme enough word to make a song (Word Song).
3,nice and easy,"not, great or originalbut easy and nice to listen to as backgroundi was trying itthis artist was recommendedto me by a fiendso i tried it outnot overwhelmingbut ok"
2,As the man said....,"... the drugs don't work.One listen to this and you'll be hesitant about taking an asprin. It's not bad, its simply a bit scary. Be thankful that John Lennon's constitution was a bit more robust."
3,"They could have just revised ""Last Word on First Names"".","This book is a good update on ""Last Word on First Names"", and that is ALL it is. I don't think they should have released it as a whole new book. I mean, there are a few new names but they are wild and crazy and nobody would use them. Like ""Trout"" is listed. I mean, come on!"
3,"trendy, without much substance","I was dissappointed with this book. After reading the reviews I don't really know what I was expecting, but what I got was almost entirely the authors' opinions. There are few entries with containing meanings and true origins, although they all have commentary on 'coolness'. If you just need an additional name resource then it's o.k., although there really aren't that many new names in it. But if you're looking for something with reference to a name's meaning and origins beyond a popular TV character or stars baby, then this books NOT for you."
3,Baby Names Now,"This book is great if you're looking for names for a story or something along those lines. You don't really get much in the way of meanings, and the selection is poor. I'll be purchasing a different name book as my husband and I couldn't find a single one in this book that we both like enough to use for our child."
5,THIS IS A MUST-HAVE NAMING BOOK!,"There are literally thousands more names here than in Last Word -- I counted them! -- including hundreds you won't find ANYWHERE else. Plus these are the only name authors who give you up-to-the-minute info on popularity, trendiness, and popular culture references for EACH name. If you care about finding the very best name for your baby, you MUST have this book!!"
2,Buying this book was a mistake,The selection of names were sparse and unsatisfying to say the least. The authors should have not have lingered on what the stars are naming their babies and concentrated more on a variety of names and derivations. My wife and I expected a lot more from these authors as parenting magazines make them out to be the end-all-be-all in names. Needless to say we will never buy a book from either of these authors again.
3,this book is a rehash of the authors' previous edition,"I glanced at the new edition of Baby Names Now and I discovered the entry for the name Alexandria which states that Keith Richards and Patti Hansen gave that name to their second daughter. That is incorrect-the correct name should have been Alexandra. If the authors had done their research, they should have made the correction in the new edition. I agree with the other reviewer that Jaden is a biblical name and not the invention of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith. I wouldn't waste my money buying this book--choose ""The Oxford Dictionary of First Names"" or ""Everyman's Book of First Names""."
4,It's cool,"I wish it had more history on the names, it's more of a basic overview and more about who is famous with the name"
5,Great Record,i really love this band. wish they would've taken off. does anyone actually have this CD for sale? would love to find it.
2,awful,"If you plan on eating these directly, they are not good. Buying these will make you want to make your own, knowing your own first try will taste better."
4,Good for baking.,I do a fair amount of German baking and several recipes use candied peel. My wife is allergic to corn and these are candied in corn syrup. I get around this by soaking them in warm water then rinsing in cold water thus removing most of the syrup.
3,Barry Farm Candied Orange Peel,"Yes, it is only OK. I was disappointed and will not buy it again.. It just not have the orange taste that was expected/"
2,Very little flavor,I suggest choosing another brand of candied orange peel. This brand is sweet but with a very mild almost unidentifiable orange flavor.
4,Want to know how to turn an egg?,"Great sampling of 32 articles from _Woodturning_ magazine, things like eggs, trays, mallets and handles, mushrooms, threaded lids, music stand, rectangular based vases, etc."
2,Stan said No to a thrid season.,to see Stan bad mouth these people (when he really is the world's nicest guy off camera) was just not him. This show was a joke and I am glad he did not want to do more.
5,i loved this seres,"this is all matter of opinion, mind you, but i really really really really enjoyed this series. i was an avid watcher when it was on sci-fi, and having it on dvd is great. i totally reccommend- best reality series so far!"
3,Lots of info,"Thie book has lots of information on sleep patterns and why/how they are the way they are.However, form what I cn tell its pretty much a slightly more ""humane"" version of the ""cry it out"" method. It DOES have some good tips on other things though, such as nap timing, bedtime routines, and comfort objects, so it really just depends on what you're looking for. :)"
2,"Amateurish, typical","This books seemed to me to be written very amateurishly. It read like a conversation with a friend, unfortunately its content seemed only about that reliable. While the author starts out talking about sleep functions, etc., she then moves on to give gobs of tangentally-related parenting advice...my point being that this ""info"" was merely opinion, and an unprofessional-sounding one at that. She didn't back up what she said in a substantial way, and I found that in fact, she didn't offer any real solutions to people in dire need of a sleeping child. At best this book offers guidelines that would be good to keep in mind before a baby is born, and a bit of info on infant sleep patterns."
1,Sleeping Through the Night,"[....] I must say I was very disappointed with the content. I did not want to resort to the typical ""cry it out"" method. After 12 months of no sleep we pulled the book out again, desperate. Our child did not start to go to sleep on her own until almost 3 weeks after starting Mindell's method. Mindell says that it will only take a week. We are now in our third month of practicing Mindell's method and our daughter still does not sleep through the night consistently. Mindell gives a lot of good info regarding why its important for infants to learn how to sleep on their own but by no means is the book a guarantee that your child will sleep through the night."
5,It has worked for all three children,"If you don't have the guts to let your baby cry some, don't bother. But if you are ready to be the parent and lovingly teach them good sleep habits, then this is the book for you. Though it has been years since I read this book, I have used the methods with all three of my kids, and they are all great sleepers, even my stubborn youngest child. Just like with everything else in our children's lives, we, the parents have to teach them good habits, even sleep habits! I understand some parents are against the cry it out methods, but those of who aren't, are not monsters. This book allows you to use your parental instincts to find a plan that works for you within her guidelines. You don't just stick a baby in a room and leave it till it falls asleep. You do go in and love the child but within reccommended guidelines."
4,Incorporated some of her ideas,"Hoping for a solution to our sleep problems, I read up on Ferber, Weissbluth and Mindell. We had a colicky baby and Weissbluth is the only one who really explained in great detail about the colicky baby. Once we were ready to sleep train, I incorporated all of the ideas from Ferber, Weissbluth and Mindell. I think Mindell is the gentliest out of the bunch so if you want to ease into sleep training, perhaps Mindell is the way to go first. For us, Weissbluth made everything better. He also explained a lot about naps too. My baby is now 7 months old and has slept through the night for a solid month. Her naps are also improving tremendously. She's such a different baby when she has enough sleep!"
5,A MUST baby/shower gift,"Our pediatrician recommended this book when our oldest was 22 months and we were expecting our second. We have read this book cover-to-cover numerous times. Before our second arrived, our first was sleeping like a charm and now our second has never had a sleep problem. All expectant parents should read this book. It will help your baby develop good sleep habits right from the beginning and you'll never have a problem. We now buy it as a gift for everyone having a baby. We cannot say enough good things about it."
2,Good facts - bad approach,"This book has lots of information about sleep, but the approach for correction is a variation of the Ferber cry to sleep method. If you can stomach many nights of crying to get to your goal this may be a book to read. If you want a more gentle approach that works just as fast I'd recommend The No Cry Sleep Solution. Both of these books are written by mothers which make them (in my opinion) better than those by professionals without children."
5,A Great Book for Every Sleep Deprived Parent!,"This book is very easy to read, and the content is excellent. There are simple step by step instructions on how to go about the process of getting your child to sleep through the night. The author gives detailed explanations of the psychology behind the techniques advised. We used the information with our 6 week old son, and after only 3 days, he is falling asleep on his own. We are finally able to get a little rest as a result of this book! We would highly reccommend this book to all sleep deprived parents in desperate need of a little shut-eye!"
1,Sleep book,"This book was recommended by our baby's pediatrician. Its really a ""cry it out"" book. So it depends on if that's a method you're willing to inflict on your child. We're looking for a new pediatrician."
1,Blatant attempt to cash in on sleep deprived parents,"This book is written in a meandering style that tells a lot of random stories but offers few solutions. The solution described is actually the Feberizing method which lets the child cry themselves to sleep, but I haven't seen the name mentioned .... copyright infringment? At any rate this book is not only a waste of time and money the advice it gives you is in my estimation very hard to even gleen and even then it is third rate at best. A much better book which offers ten times the information in one chapter is ""Secrets of the Baby Whisperer"" by Tracy Hogg."
4,Establishing a routine was essential for our little one,"I haven't read the entire book, just skipped to the sections that applied to our 10 month old. Within 1 week of establishing a bed time routine, our little one was sleeping 11 hours in his own crib. I wouldn't say it's a miracle. I think a lot of different methods work for different children when implemented appropriately. But this book seemed to appeal to my common sense and happened to ""work like a charm"" for our baby."
3,"Good falling asleeo, but still not sleeping throught the night","We have been using this method for over a month now and even though first two nights were tough as our son cried for almost an hour, now he goes to bed no problem, no crying. He might fuss for 10-15mins but then just falls asleep, but the reason i gave this 3 stars is that he still does not sleep through the night. He is in bed but 7:30 and still wakes up around 12 and then again around 4 am for a feeding. He is 6 month. He is doing well with naps now too, falling asleep on his own, so i am happy about that."
4,Good Information and it Helped,"This book really helped. Most of the information might be old hat for experienced moms who have established sleeping patterns for lots of kids, but as a first time mom, I learned a bunch. I went from having to hold and rock my baby to sleep for two hours and trying to put her in her crib without her noticing, to laying her in her crib awake and her sleeping through the night. I'm not talking about that ""more than five hours"" sleeping through the night, I am talking about 8 pm to 7 am. I am having a harder time with my second daughter, but I imagine it would be much worse if I wasn't doing the things I learned in this book. The book is heavy on routines and self soothing, and I think it makes sense."
3,Does not solve night wakings due to hunger,"Jodi Mindell's view is that if you can get your child to fall asleep on their own at night, then your baby will sleep through. Well, at least 80% of babies will. Mine is one of the 20% that still wakes at night. She does offer some solutions to night waking, but failed to be our answer, since my child wakes up hungry, and a hungry child needs to be fed at night. So if your child is going to sleep without your help and waking hungry at night, don't bother with this book. It won't have an answer for you."
1,Very Upsetting Book,"If you do not believe in letting your baby cry herself to sleep, do not buy this book. I have read everything from Dr. Sears to this woman, Mindell, and she is the worst. She devotes an entire page to vomiting and explains how the baby does this to manipulate the parents. She even goes on to say that some enjoy vomiting! What kind of helpful information is that? It seems like child abuse to me and hopefully to other parents too. These are babies we are talking about, not dogs, although I wouldn't treat my pets this way either. This book completely pushed me over to attachment parenting. (...) My baby will never have to experience any of this wacky stuff that Mindell pushes."
2,Nothing New Here . . .,"Yawn. The only one this book helped sleep better was me! I couldn't stay awake when I tried to read it. Dr. Mindell's attempt to put scientific research and behavioral theory into layman's terms comes off as condescending. This book does not have anything new to offer. The promised ""practical tips on bedtime"" are the same ones I bet you've read on some parenting website. The author's ""tried and true method"" is nothing more or less than making your children cry themselves to sleep. If you are already familiar with the ""cry-it-out"" method and understand sleep associations and the importance of bedtime routines, don't bother buying this book. There is nothing new here."
3,"Good, but not enough","This was a great book for us. It really helped us with the bedtime portion of sleep training. Within a few nights of being put to bed awake, our son was putting himself to sleep without crying. However, he still dealt with night wakings for another few months. According to Mindell, the night wakings should eventually cease. I read The No Cry Sleep Solution, The Baby Whisperer, and Good Night, Sleep Tight. What finally worked for us was Good Night, Sleep Tight by Kim West. We realized the importance of eliminating night feedings, which our son was using as a crutch, or a negative sleep association. It did involve some tears, but we are all sleeping much better now. His naps have even improved! Good Night, Sleep Tight seems very much the middle ground between crying it out and the no-cry sleep solution."
1,Nothing new,This book did not include any information that I wasn't already aware of. There was nothing insightful and I returned it immediately. I would not recommend it.
1,At ease with my daughter,"My daughter is two years old and this book helped me normalize my child's behavior. My daughter is my only child so i had nothing to compare her sleeping patterns. However, after reading this book, i understand that i am doing the right thing and that she is a unique and special child. I related to several of the stories in the book and it helped me be more patient and understanding of my daughter. Thanks Dr. Jodi MIndell for writing this book."
1,Child Abuse,"The methods prescribed in this book are CHILD ABUSE - plain and simple. If you are desparate and tired - try reading a book that will help you UNDERSTAND infant developmental appropriateness - Dr. Sears and Elizabeth Pantley are good.If you have to harden your heart to let your baby cry until they vomit - you are ignoring nature's gift to you ""Mother's Instinct"".Ask yourself how YOU would want to be treated? Humanely and with respect.All the posters who say it ""worked like a charm"" are fooling themselves about the long-term effects of this type of program. Parenting is a long road - a quick solution may not be the answer!"
3,Not my favorite,"As I am a complete research fiend, I got every book on sleep when trying to figure out how to get my baby to sleep through the night. It seems that most of them are contradictory with each other -- you could never use all the theories, so you have to pick and choose what works for you. I could never do the ""let the baby cry it out"" thing... I didn't particularly agree with the methods outlined in this book..."
4,Great reference...,This book is a great guide; it's a must read for new parents.The book isn't a magic pill but the techniques have helped us establish solid sleep routine for my son!
1,Just the old Cry it Out routine - not for me!,"ARGH. I wish I hadn't wasted my money! I thought this book was supposed to have alternatuves to Crying it Out but it basically says babies will NEVER grow out of bad sleep habits on their own - CIO is the ONLY way. She says babies will cry 40 minutes (or so) the first night. So why did my 10 month old son go 2.5 hours of screaming and the begin puking!?!? And she says if they puke it's no big deal. She says babies think it is FUN????? WHATEVER! This book just depressed me and made me realize I may never get a good night sleep again. Don't waste your money on this book unless you were considering CIO. If you were looking for an alternative to CIO to get your baby to sleep through the night, look somewhere else."
1,Not baby friendly advice!,"I was so offended when I read this book. The author kept referring to infants who don't sleep through the night as having ""sleep problems"", and to eliminate night-time nursings at 3 months! She also advocates letting your child cry, even if they vomit from being so upset, and even then she says you should refrain from picking them up or comforting them. How can that be considered baby-friendly advice? I thought it was disgusting and appalling. She referrs to infants as being pathetic and using it to their advantage to get what they want. There are so many other great books out there if you are frustrated about night waking. ""Nighttime Parenting"" by Dr. William Sears is a much better book that not only helps you find solutions, but has much more accurate information about the needs of infants, toddlers and older children."
1,A Babies Worst Nightmare!,"As a very tired parent, I was looking for insight and advise on how to help our whole family get a good nights sleep. I read feverishly until I got to the sentence that states that children ""enjoy"" vomitting! Are you kidding? I cringed at the thought of me following this woman's dvise and my sweet, trusting, and loving 4 month old son vomitting because he had cried so hard and this woman stating that he was enjoying himself! Shame on her. This ""Ph.d"" lost any bit a credit she ever thought about having in my eyes. This book is a baby's worst nightmare. If you love you child please do not buy this book!"
5,worth every penny,"I purchased this book to learn how to teach our 3 month old how to go to sleep in his crib. I did not want to set a standard for rocking or nursing him to sleep. Very imformative book. It taught me a lot about my baby's needs. Although, nursing him when he woke in the middle of the night did not work for us. Our son was waking three to four times a night. We stopped the middle of the night feedings and within a few days he was sleeping for about 10 1/2 hours every night!"
3,"Not Terrible, not near as good as the original","While, Open Water, had a feel of realistic terror, which was why I liked it so much, ""Open Water 2- Adrift"" is believable, if you take into account how stupid some people are, as everybody dies not because of the initial drunken stupidity of the jumping off the boat without the ladder down, but because they are to stupid to figure obvious solutions to get back on the boat.Very frustrating, and not near as satisfying as the original."
2,Could have been much better,"I enjoyed the ""Open Water"", but this sequel fell flat. It's really a shame, because the film makers had all the right elements in place to create a really good film. The title should have been, ""Open Water 2: Wasted Potential"".The characters were interesting until their IQs were reduced during the film. The concept of the film was great: 6 people may die in spite of being able to touch their muli-million dollar yacht. Safety is inches away, yet they cannot reach it. Wow, that really had my interest.Some reviewers said it was a good movie if you can just overlook the stupidity of the characters. That is probably very true. Unfortunately, I just couldn't do that. Every time they had a chance, they did something stupid. Often, all 6 let something stupid happen without even one speaking up. I watched 100% of the film, just to see what happened, but I was completely disappointed with the film.It wasn't terrible, just very weak."
1,Not as good as the first one.,I had to force myself to finish this but the whole time I felt like I was just waiting for something to happen.
1,really?,"The people in this movie were idiots (perhaps only marginally smarter than the idiots that made this stinker).... If you want to watch a movie about stupid people drowning simply because they're stupid (and I'm not talking about forgetting the ladder), then have at it. I wish I had my 2 hours back."
3,"It's Just ""Ok""","This movie is ok. Unfortunately, that's the best I can say about it. There are many other films with a similar plot (people trapped in water without a rescue in sight). The folks ended up stranded under the most idiotic circumstances, and they didn't really pursue the best means to save themselves until the very end. At that point, it was too late. The ambiguous ending did not help. The beautiful scenery was the best thing about the film."
2,It was entertaining...,"But had one of the worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts? For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around. And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense? These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks! Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers."
3,Not quite as good as the original...,"but not a bad flick, anyway. The film does a good job of conveying the stress and the sense of hopelessness of the characters. I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping for them. Like the original (highly recommended if you haven't seen it. This is not a sequel as much as a common theme), the movie is ""based on actual events"". I preferred the original's stance on using little known actors. It gave it a touch more authenticity. Not a bad film, just a little flat."
3,HOPELESSLY ADRIFT,"The original OPEN WATER captured our interest due to its frightening premise and the terror of two people lost in the ocean and the ever present threat of sharks.Supposedly based on actual events, this OPEN WATER doesn't have the sharks, but it is deeply depressing anyway. Although most of the people aren't that sympathetic, their frustration at being so close to their yacht but their inability to save themselves is disturbing. Eric Dane (GREY'S ANATOMY) plays the deceptive owner of the yacht and the cast is to be admired for having to give their performances while afloat. Ultimately, however, the movie sinks and its nebulous ending is frustrating."
2,it was an okay rental,"I saw the first Open Water and thought it was pretty good .This one was pretty good as well, i didn't expect much from it at all but it wound up being decent. No sharks in this onebut the tension builds up pretty well. The unknown actors were decent, the boat was cool and overall I would say it's worth a rental at least if you get a 3rd one freebie deal going ."
3,A good time waster,"Yes, there are moments in the film that defy logic, but the fun of this one, like its predecessor, is the psychological drama. Thankfully the most annoying character is knocked off first, and it's pretty damn easy to tell who's going to survive, but I found this an engaging way to spend 94 minutes. For those interested, numerous naked male bum shots will enliven the proceedings!"
2,Open Water / Closed Minded 2,"This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies ever to watch. It goes to show that when people are in a life and death situation that 9 out of 10 people will panic, lose faith in each other, and die. I watched it with my wife and we spent most of the movie speaking out loud and asking why won't they do this or that.The ending was really bad and leaves you with a blank feeling.The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the suspense the movie gives you. I, however, would rent it if I were you before deciding whether or not to purchase."
2,Open Water 2 - Adrift with Idiots,"The original Open Water was an interesting independent movie based on true events that had some good moments of suspense and a good ending. Open Water 2 shares none of those qualities.I almost immediately disliked all the characters, some of the scenes were preposterous (as others have mentioned, let's have the heaviest person climb up!), the interpersonal tension was overdone (to hell with trying to figure out a way out, let's just argue some more), and the ending was [multiple expletives deleted] insulting, or should I say endings? And not just the last 2 scenes, the mother's decision/action before them was laughable.I'll give it 2 stars because it was well shot and I have definitely seen worse. If you haven't seen the original, your time will be better spent watching it and skipping this one."
1,They Dont THink,"Okay, thought it was going to be interesting but what I was thinking the entire movie is why didn't one of those 3 strong muscle men just lift up one of those 100lb girls from the start??? Once they couldn't figure that out until the end and all but 2 died, I tuned out.."
4,Realistic and Dramatic,"I think this movie was very heartbreaking. To see a mother go thru this was awful. Those that think this can't happen. Have you ever been on a large boat? Go on one and jump over. Then look up. Try to imagine getting up without a ladder. In life situations panic sets in, you can't think straight. As a mom myself, if your child is stranded, that would put additional worry in.This movie was excellent. It truly showed the fear and the things that can happen. The ocean is a cruel place. It's based on a true story of things that happened, it easily could happen to anyone. All it takes is too much to drink or one moment of fun without thinking. Everyone jumped in to swim, thinking someone else would lower the ladder.We have the video and I'll watch it again. The only bad part is the ending. From reading I've found that Amy and her daughter survive, and speculation says Dan does as well."
3,Not as Good as the First,"This movie sucks you in and holds you even though you know it is stupid and can almost guess what will happen. A group of people go overboard on a yacht and because the ladder is not lowered, they cannot get back in the boat. To top it off one of the couples have left their baby sleeping on the yacht so they need to get back to take care of him.The rest of the movie is based on stupidity and you wonder why they cannot figure out how to get back in the boat. The group starts fighting amongst themselves leading to accidents among the group and to the group foiling a possible rescue. The group is so stupid that when bad things happen to them, the audience takes very little pity on them.The first movie, based on a true event was much better and you really felt the terror of the couple involved."
2,Boooring,"This has got to be one of the dullest films I have rented in a while. The pretty much took the same idea as the original and made another with a slightly different plot line. It would seem that 2007 is the year of sequels, and this is one that probably could have gone without being made. Oh well, thats what rentals are for I guess, try it before you buy it."
2,i hoped for a few things to be diffrnt,"i was disapointed about the ""NO sharks"" it hoguth this woudl be kidn of like how the blair wich series was, th first oen wasjust a cemer like the firs open water th 2nd blair wich not much better bu you see spirits here voices here sounds see afew action things i thought ther be thing like th in this one mosltyt he sharks"
1,some kind of....what?,"I hope Bobby Caldwell wouldn't mind me saying that this isn't one of his greatest efforts. The song 'Once You Give In' is nice, but not more. The rest of the cd is a crossover-mixture between a weak billy joel and ........i don't no. save money folks."
1,All Pop and no Soul,I think that this album is a bust. Bobby Caldwell got away from his jazz roots. I don't hear any soul in this album that's what I'm used to hearing from his music. It's all pop and no punch.
1,PURE POO!,"Ummmm...well, it DID NOT WORK AT ALL! Maybe had a signal for like 2 seconds and then it would cut out. Tried all the troubleshooter advice but it was no use. I couldn't get it to work and I was very disappointed. So buy at your own risk!"
1,What a waste of time,"The album has a poor sound to it and the new guitar parts are spliced in, they are just aweful. Paul Chapman should have stayed around but it did not work out."
1,Such a Wayste,"I agree with DOJO's review below, except that 2 stars is generous. Firstly, I love these guys and although Fin's scratchy voice is an acquired taste, the old stuff was fab. Who knows what the real story is, but Chris George's guitar sound or the production job is/are woeful. It sounds like George just mailed it in from ProTools. Check out Chapman's wesbite for the real sounds. The shame of it all is that this could have been a good/great album. Sigh...."
2,"Nice towel, wrong color","Towel texture and design were great, but I was disappointed the towel was orange and not blue like the item image. The seller needs to change the image so buyers know what color they are buying."
5,Great book...,"I got this book from the library after purchasing another tour guide and wished I would have gotten this one. I found it very useful. Things that I specially liked were the touring guides, the age-based ratings of the attractions and ratings of all the counter-service restaurants. Most guides only talk about the sit-down restaurants, but most people will eat at more of the counter-service ones. I followed their touring plans and they worked very well (we took our trip over Spring Break). The only thing I wished it had was color pictures."
1,Big thumbs down,"I found this book to be a major disappointment. Of the many turnoffs, one being the section titled, ""Types of Parents and Types of Children"" where Mr. Sehlinger goes into way out-of-touch psycho babble. ""In the context of a Disney vacation, it is useful to locate your, your partner's, and your combined parenting type on the parenting continuum and your child's basic personality type on the personality continuum."" Please! However, Kim Wright Wiley's book, ""Walt Disney with Kids 2000"" is much more informative and leaves the parenting to the parents."
1,Horrible book - too many errors!,"We've been to WDW three times with our two small children in the past 2 years. We decided to become Annual Passholders because its cheaper. We have now read 9 books on WDW - hey, saving on the trips if you are going to take them requires planning. Of all the books we own or have borrowed this one just plain reads like an attempt at a fast buck!On a factual level: There are so many errors in here about when things happen, which characters are where, etc that it is a complete waste of money. In addition to the factual errors, the authors arrogance about what they like (as opposed to describing the quality or characteristics of something so the reader can decide for themselves) is just too ever-present.Pass on this one and look elsewhere if you actually want to know what to do with the kids at WDW. We were VERY disappointed in this book on our trip this month! The best choice for us, and MANY of the families we know and work with, has been the PassPorter series!"
5,Packed with useful info,"I thought this book was extremely helpful for our trip with 2 & 4 yo kids. It is full of info that is directly relevant to taking children of various ages (from nursing babies to teenagers) to Disney. I particularly appreciated the detailed descriptions of potential fright-factors of various attractions. We also loved the top 10 snack list, although some of it was out of date. The touring plans are really smart. The chapters on the physical and emotional aspects of Disney family trips were awesome - I really found them helpful in managing expectations and planning our day to day to keep everyone from becoming tired and cranky. The book is small enough that you can carry it with you into the parks, and we referred to it throughout the day. Really added a lot to our trip."
3,"Poor warranty service, otherwise OK","We've purchased about a dozen of these to replace dying Dell batteries for Latitude D620 and D630 laptops. They generally seem to match the Dell OEM in terms of battery life (ranges about 2-2.5 hours with our configuration) and fit and look just like them. They arrive in good condition and don't look cheap like an eBay import from China.On the other hand, we had one battery only keep about 10% of it's life after 6 months or so of use. While Lenmar has agreed to replace it, they want $15 for ""return shipping"" after we pay the cost to ship the defective unit to them (just $5 via UPS.) Very few companies still keep this policy of the user having to pay for return shipping -- in addition, $15 is steep for a 1 pound shipment (and going from Southern to Northern California, no less.) Time to go back to buying Dell batteries where the support from our account team will undoubtedly be better."
1,defective battery,"does not hold charges like the original dell batteries, need to continue to plug in for it to work, should never buy an aftermarket item"
2,Disappointing,I eagerly awaited this DVD because I really enjoyed Tone and Sweat. This was a big disappointment.
3,Not very good value for money,"This is an okay shampoo- it's light, it lathers well enough. The scent is light and clean. I'm not sure exactly what the scent is, perhaps soapwort? It's a very light scent, not at all perfumey. The main problem with this shampoo is that it's runny. It takes quite a bit to lather up one's full head (especially if you have long or thick hair). Given that this shampoo is pretty pricey, it becomes pretty hard to justify given how much gets wasted. For a shampoo that's just okay it's not worth the price."
3,rumble rumble,I bought this after returning a KLH 12 inch subwoofer to Costco. It was the second KLH to quit on me. The KLH has more punch than the Audiosource. The SW10 has a more rumble sounding bass rather than punchy. Great for earthquake movies but not music. I might try packing it with foam to see if that improves it.
4,Notjust a theory but demonstrating how to put it to use,"Recreating Democracy is a book with some answers to a question that is increasingly being asked by citizens across our nation as we drift towards the first presidential election of the new millennium -- can democracy as we now practice it survive? And if we have doubts, as many of us do, what stratagies can we invent to repair its faults and make it work for the benefit of ""we, the people""?Wells and Lemmel not only suggest some new and imaginative strategies for saving democracy but, what may be of equal importance, provide a series of logical steps for engaging citizens in their consideration that could be of use for other new ideas as well."
4,Helpful in night driving,"I installed these lights on my motorhome for use on dirt road night-time driving as the stock headlights from factory are pretty weak. I chose Hella as they appear to be well made and have a decent reputation however the rear housings ARE plastic. The box kit contains everything you need to install the system which is nice, though I didn't use it. Although not recommended by Hella, I used heavier gauge wiring and a heavier relay and then substituted the included 50w bulbs with 100w bulbs. They do get hot but so far in limited use they have not suffered any ill effects. Don't expect to be blown away by the light output, even with 100w bulbs, but they definitely help which is exactly what I needed. They are far better than the cheapy units which I have used in the past and would not waste my money or my time."
1,Heavy on Marxist theory and short on historical knowledge,"While there is a fair amount of interesting historical information in the book, it is spoiled by a very heavy dose of academic Marxism and class resentment, as well as an amazing lack of basic historical knowledge (or perhaps, a denial of anything which contradicts theory -- such as assertions that dress and purchase distinctions based on gender and social class were minimal until the development of capitalism). The sections on the development of radios as consumer items are about the only parts of the book not infused with political theory."
5,What a mind blowing novel!,"This novel was brought to my attention through Diva's Book Club and I must say that it was an eye keeper! As the daughter of a Pastor, I often see these kinds of acts but never in the light that Nicolle has shown them in. From the beginning from the Delta meeting to the point where she found out he had ISSUES I could not stop reading. If you are looking for a book that will keep you on edge wondering what is going to happen next? Then I suggest that you read this book!"
4,CAPTIVATING AND INTRIGUING,"Nicolle Pierce's first offering, The Sacred Sermon, takes the reader into an insightful look into a young woman's search for success, spirituality and love.This novel is an easy read with a smooth-flowing storyline and very believable characters.The pages almost turned by themselve as I followed the journey of Natalie Thomas, the main character, on an emotional roller coaster ride of ambition, joy, sorrow and hope. With her career spiralling upward and her spirituality in question, Natalie's pursuit of love gets caught up in a web of deceit, lies, seduction and betrayal.I applaude Ms Pierce for bringing to light the taboo lifestyle of so-called ministers of God. In many churches this is simply not talked about, swept under the carpet or just tolerated!Kudos to Ms Pierce, a new star on the horizon, for she will have you examining your own issues of spirituality and love. Unfortunately, we all have a past."
3,Christian or Carnal? Christians ARE Carnal,"This was passed down to me to read. It was all too true about the jackleg preacher and members. I personally feel that just because you confess to being a Christian does not exempt you from using profanity, commiting fornication, adultery, having abortions, telling lies and other crimes. Being a Christian just means that you BELIEVE the Bible. It doesn't necessarily mean that you OBEY the scriptures. I know a whole lot of people that tell lies, party all night, drink like sailors, smoke marijuana, snort cocaine, cheat, fornicate, etc. and they dedicatedly sit in the front pews on Sunday mornings, waiting for church to be over so they can get back into their sinful lives. So as you can see, Christians are sinners too! Just check out the book called ""Best Kept Secrets"" by Kimberly Roby and you'll read about some of the biggest Christian sinners around. I didn't make any review/comment on that book because it was just too trifling for me."
4,A Real Page Turner,"The is a great book to read. I enjoyed the book so much I let my friend read it. She finished the book in no time!In the book all of the warning signs were there, but she chose to ignore them. We do that when we love a man.I had the chance of meeting Nicolle Pierce at The Breakfast Klub at her book signing. I loved it so much I called 97.9 the box (Houston) to let the Madd Hatta Morning Show know how great it was.I did notice quite a few typos. Hopefully the sequel will not have so many typos.I can't wait to read the sequel!!!!!!!!!"
4,Truly Sacred!,"I enjoyed this book based on the reality of what can happen within the confines of the church. Pastors, are generally put on a pedstal based on there connection with God and His people; however what many fail to realize is that behind the title lies a fleshly man and his ego. Nicolle, the author does a wonderful job drawing you into the relationship between Natalie Thomas and Pastor Kevin Lewis. What seemed innocent and inviting, unravels the truth of the flesh."
5,Be Careful What You Wish For,"Ladies we've prayed and asked God for a ""Christian"" man. The Sacred Sermon does an excellent job of demonstrating the negative consequences of getting involved with someone who is involved with the church, but whose life is not spiritually based; especially when we are not following God's will. This book shows us that we must follow God's plan for our lives even when it comes to falling in love. As a young adult, I used to wonder why it was a sin to have sex before you were married. The Sacred Sermon shows you why. I loved this book. It was a book of the month selection for my book club and all the members loved it, including our Hispanic members. Our club is diverse, so this novel was able to reach women on all levels regardless of color. Read it...You might see a bit of Natalie in you! Great Read."
3,Fantastic - You Got to Read,"I was very excited about this book and it kept me on edge. Just when I thought the drama would end, it picked upa nd got even more exciting. The author did a great job of keeping the reader interested and guessing what was going to happen next. I can't wait until the follow come out, I hope the sequel is as good as the original book. I met the author and was excited to meet us and to know how excited she is about the upcoming book make me not want to waiting and go ahead and get the manuscript and read it. Good luck and much success inthe future."
4,beautiful photos and wonderul haiku!,when I first saw this little book I read it from cover to cover before I could put it down! the photos were beautiful and combined with clever haiku. they artists were really able to capture the cafe culture. I hope to find other titles soon from this independent publisher from san francisco.
1,Horrible,There was only the sound from the back ground music you could not hear the actual show. The picture quality was real excellent quality.
2,AgreedUponItsAReRun,"This episode is indeed a compilation of clips from previous seasons. Not bad, but I was suprised because this was the ""season premier"" of season four. Usually the first shows are full of the new stuff that will get people to continue watching. This wasn't a bad show, because the series in general is great, but throughout this episode I couldn't help myself from thinking ""stock footage"" with new music."
1,No Inferno,"We purchased season 4 episode 13 because it was described as a trooper in Soldotna saving a disabled man, but that never happened in the episode. Instead it was a bunch of stuff in the valley. I don't think this was the episode it was supposed to be and probably not the one that aired. This was a big disappointment. Also there was no dialog, just back round music. The voice track was completely missing so you couldn't really tell what was going on except for a few subtitles. I think this deserves a refund."
4,Kinda big,"The pendant was much bigger than I was expecting. It's very difficult to find an outfit that this necklace will go with because of the oversized pendent, I haven't been able to wear it much. The quality of the beads is good, the pendant is sort of plastic feeling but you have to touch it to notice. The cord everything is strung on is very cheap.Nice peice if you really want to make a statement and no one's going to look too close."
5,Thanks for the Memory,I was somewhat concerned about the packaging of the product. Other reviewers mentioned these arrive in a cardboard sleeve. That is true but the memory was well protected. Easy to install. Computer recognized the extra memory on boot and the computers (now with 12GB) is running noticeably faster. A good value.
1,Lots of problems,"Worked for a month, then CD died, got another under warranty and CD died after 6 months. It is a design problem, stay away from it!"
3,"Everything works, but worth the price?","Well, everything works on this item. I have not had any problems with the CD player or the time or the radio. The radio and CD quality are what you would expect. My complaint is with the buttons...you need to memorize the manual or keep it by the clock. It may be just because I only need an alarm once in a great while and by that time I have forgotten how the buttons work, but figuring them out by messing with the clock is difficult. The shape of this clock is odd also. And, if light bugs you at night, you'll need to keep this one on the floor or covered with a towel, gads. So, I deduct 2 stars. And I wonder if the [money] I spent on it was worth it."
4,Louie's Downfall,"The book provided a good overview of man who was responsible for creating much of Hollywood and it's legends. Unfortunately, he also held traditional and somewhat antiquated values which were out of touch with those of movie subjects in the 50's and 60's. Then, TV became one of the final nails in his coffin as more people watched the box than went to movies. The book also reflects the business world, who replaced Mayer with Dore Schary at a moment's notice with no remorse whatsoever. Mayer was a bigger man than his bosses were. Of course, all they were concerned about was their money. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Isn't that right Bernie Madoff?"
5,The Golden Age,"Today's Hollywood is releasing tired remakes of bad TV Shows. What happened to writing? What happened to the studio system? While Louis B. Mayer and his empire had its fair share of blemishes, the star power and creative output was extrordinary by any measure. This book takes you inside the ""dream factory."" I'd advise fans of ""classic"" Hollywood to also check out: ""Reel to Real: 25 years of celebrity profiles from vaudeville to movies to TV"" by David Fantle & Tom Johnson. It features rare interviews and photos with such legendary stars as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, James Cagney, Lucille Ball and about 55 others."
4,Easy read,"If you want a little light history about Louis B., this is for you.I prefer a little more insider dirt in bios but this was a nice easy read."
5,Watercolors of beautiful England,"People, places, history, description in this great book of a series of books, from the 50's it appears, called Beautiful England & Scotland. (list of all the books are in this book.) Very attractive watercolors, 12 or 13, are special. Great deal, recommended."
2,beef tendons,"Purchased a couple of these to try out. Were vacuum packed in plastic individually and terribly hard to open. They were very small in size for the price and the dogs ate them within a minute. Usually a regular 8""-10"" lasts them for 10-15 mins. Would not buy again for that price."
1,Not the Real Deal,"Thanks, Rick, for the warning. I bought this item from Amazon five years ago only to discover it was not the classic Republic Studio propaganda film about the development of the B-29 in WWII, with Forrest Tucker and Wendell Cory in a love triangle, and Phil Harris of Jack Benny fame providing musical and comedy relief. I informed Amazon of this oversight, and they said they would fix it. Guess they got too busy..."
4,There is a mix-up here.,"""Wild Blue Yonder"" and ""The Wild Blue Yonder"" are two entirely different things. The former is from the 50's and the later is a documentary. Please correct the descriptions."
1,Another Rip-Off,"Amazon and ""The Cotton Group"" also misled me into paying for the wrong product. I received the Air Force documentary instead of the film advertised by Amazon as starring Wendell Corey and Vera Ralston."
5,"It was educational, but also interesting and fun to read.","I am twelve years old and I love this book. Some books about the saints are VERY boring. They're too long, and give too many facts. But, this book is all in poetry so it's easy to read. It also gives interesting information about the saints. Next to each poem there's an awesome picture of the saint. It gives just enough info. without being boring. I love this book, and I'm sure everyone else will also like it as much as I did."
2,A memoir of the blacklist?,"I thought that ""Inside Out: A memoir of how wonderful myself and my friends were"" would have been a better title. An un-entertaining book with lots of name dropping.I found it informative on neither Hollywood nor the blacklist and got no feel for the era.Why was the author a socialist? He never gives a reason for his idealism , simply seems to have gone along for the gag."
4,Marina es inolvidable,Los personajes enamoran y la trama es de un suspenso electrificante. Carlos Ruiz Zafon se ha convertido en uno de mis escritores favoritos de todos los tiempos.
3,Marina,"This book is what's expected of Mr. Zafon as he keeps the reader in suspence and guessing all the way to the end of the book. Although the book was infieror the the Shadow of the Wind, it is worth reading."
5,Great Novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon,"This is a great novel by a great writer, Carlos Ruiz Zafon. I wish there were translations of his works in English so more people would know his work. Fantastic story & characters! I totally recommend it!"
1,This is a microscope the way a paper tube is a telescope!,"A VERY disappointing Christmas gift for my son the budding scientist. You can't really see through it at all. It is more of a toy than the ""microscope"" it is advertised as. I'd recommend spending $20 on something more substantial and not dashing someone's hopes."
2,soft bristles,"This brush would have everything to be great,unfortunately it's bristles are to soft so they bend a lot when in contact with the hair,but brush's body is great very resistant,I wish they make this brushes like revo stlye used to make."
3,Iron Eagle is great...,"What a soundtrack, though not as good as Top Gun, has its own songs, Queen, especially with One Vision, then a Katrina and the Waves MANIAC House, not as good as Walking on Sunshine, Most of it is a blend between stuff you can rock to, or sappy, Urgent's Love can make you cry, Eric Martin , These are the Good Times, anyway, all around is another 80's soundtrack, either love it, like it or completely hate it..."
4,Classic 80s Rock,"The soundtrack to Iron Eagle adds flavor to an otherwise cheesy story of an 18-year old who steals an F-16B to rescue his father (with his walkman blasting all the way). I really liked this soundtrack, especially ""Hide In The Rainbow"" and ""Road of The Gypsy."" Anyone who likes 80s music or misses the hip-hop, rock n' roll action movies of the era will love this soundtrack."
3,Missing a Few...,"I did like this album, but also wish it was made more complete. Along with the other two songs mentioned in previous reviews I would like ""We're not Gonna Take it"" by Twisted Sister (the moment he decides to take action) to be added. It's the whole feeling of a soundtrack that makes it good, and this soundtrack is incomplete without those three songs."
4,Found the song - Old Enough to Rock and Roll,"For those of you like me, who have been searching for this song since it came out, and now I have found it. The artist, Rainey Hanes, has a website where she has released the song ""Old Enough to Rock & Roll"". The story behind why the song has not been released earlier is interesting. Go to RaineyOnline.com and you can get your copy. I just ordered mine. Hope this was helpful."
2,Great Movie...song track not so great.,"This was one of my son's favorite movies and I liked it as well, but the soundtrack only has about 3 songs I like and listen to. I would have been better off previewing the album on iTunes and just downloading the 3 songs, but for $8.94 cost, it wasn't too bad."
5,I loved it!!!!!!,"From a puppy raiser, this book it very faithful to the puppy raising experience. It describes, perfectly, all the emotions involved with this process."
5,supersweatin is right!,This is a great workout. It is more high intensity than some of his others. I love the music. Keep up the good work Richard!
5,Fantastic!,"Richard Simmons has totally outdone himself with this dvd!!!The music is easy to hear and upbeat and you can hear Richard's cueing and motivational words over the music easily. The outstandingly choreographed routines are challenging enough to really get your heart rate up and keep it up smoothly. There are stretches and a warm up and a cool down seamlessly incorporated into the workout.The sound and picture quality are tops!Every person who was involved with this video loves Richard because only that can make this happen.Richard,God bless you!!!"
4,Good analysis but not good story telling.,"This book provides a good scholarly overview of the old Irish myths. However, if you are looking for a good book with which to learn the myths or to read to your children, this is not it. What it gains in analysis it loses in storytelling. A good book but only to a point."
5,Absolutely excellent!,"Despite the fact that this book is almost a century old, it is a remarkable and exhaustive collection of both Gaelic (Irish) and Cymric (Welsh) legends. I have not even read all of it yet, but I am utterly impressed with the sections that I have. An analysis of how Arthurian legend grew out of (and eventually separate from) Celtic oral tales, the only retelling of the Voyage of Maeldun that I've seen in such a volume as this, and a wide variety of tales from the Ossianic cycle are only a few of this books excellent features. Best of all is the handling of the Irish invasion myths. I had read three accounts of this cycle of Gaelic mythology, but this was the first one where I was able to keep track of who was who among the many characters and groups that walk on and off the stage. The book is a must-read for anyone interested in Celtic mythology, whether they are whetting their curiosity for the first time or are already familiar with that body of remarkable literature."
4,Excellent,"It is difficult to write a review of this piece, without being redundant, my apoligies if I am.It is an excellent primer in Celtic mythology, and I'd recommend it to anyone delving into such.The Aryan undertones are not as pronounced as some other point out,they are there. I must confess being totally oblivious to them until it was pointed out in one of the other reviews. It is in the right of every author to put their own spin to their work, even one that might be used as reference. I do believe in a mythological reference one has literary license to do so, as long as the readers have the intellect to take any of it with a grain of salt, and move on with their own research for a more ecclectic view.The back cover splash nails it with this statement, ""With over forty delightful illustrations, Celtic Mtyhs and Legends provides and immensely readable introduction to Celtic Tales."""
4,Out of date but excellent,"For the holed stone Dolmens I had to give it a high rating, butfor Celtic history is seems dated from an archaeological point of view.This book isn't the first book I've read in this area and I've done extensive web searches.A lot was old hat but some was new.I like the old fashioned pictures.This book is again one of Dover books' classic revivals.And as usual dated material is going to go out of date.In recent times we have gotten a better idea of who the "" Megalithic People"" wereand they don't appear to be Aryan, but pre- Aryan , maybe more related tothe Basque. Yet the book brings a lot of the tales of these early peopleinto the light."
4,Gold standard,"This may not be the platonic ideal of Gioconda, but it is more than good enough for the connoisseur or first-time listener. The cast is all big-name (if you don't have such a lineup, the piece ins't worth listening to) and on their best behavior; one would be hard-pressed to bring together a cast this strong today. The fine orchestra lacks the proper italianità spirit, but you can't have everything."
1,Poor Product,"I was very disappointed in this product. Its performance was very poor. The signal was lost repeatedly and so you had to constantly fiddle with the reciever and headphone to hear anything. Even when you were able to tune in, the reception was scratchy. However the worse part of this purchase is that it cannot be returned because it has been opened."
1,A Terrible Irresponsible Film,"Except for the quote about politicians taking Viagra, I found this film depressing.I wonder how films like this get made. How do people who work on them get up in the morning and go to work? The sodden predictability of the humor and the so-called plot left me wanting to bail out after the first half hour.I liked the nudity. It relived the boredom for a few seconds.However, the film portrays the worst aspects of human character. It also makes fun of crooked cops, makes fun of any authority, and generally promotes the idea that driving in an extremely unsafe manner is just good clean fun.Too many people die on the roads each year, and authority in this country is breaking down. So, the idea that this film is funny is, in my humble opinion, incredible."
2,Sorry Jessica,"I used to love watching the original show each Friday night. I'd look forward to it each week. Often when you hear that a remake is going to be made of either a good movie or a classic TV show, you somehow instinctively know that it's never going to compare to the original. This is the case here. It's been totally ruined. Now younger viewers have some false idea of how the show probably used to be. I normally love Jessica Simpson but she was enough to make me throw up here. And as for Stiffler? I didn't expect much from Johnny Knoxville but I would have hoped for something better from Stiffler. There were hardly any funny parts (I cringed during them all) and the acting (needless to say) was shocking. If filmmakers have no new fresh ideas, then when you remake a movie - do it right. True fans of Dukes of Hazzard, stay clear."
5,Loved this Movie,"I absolutely Love this movie. Even though I was a HUGE Fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV Show, I love Johnny Knoxville in this Movie and Jessica Simpson. My All time Favorite Scene is where Luke is trying to get the Safe unstuck from the telephone pole and Bo takes off with Luke riding the Safe. I love when Luke gets up to the side of the truck and says ""I said No Bo....NO!!"" I just love this movie and It makes me laugh every time I watch it."
3,Good Movie But...,"I absolutely love this movie but I think Jessica is a bad actress, they should've choose Jessica Biel instead, shes a good actress.Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilairous...Jessica not so much."
2,Such a Disappointment,"OMG... what a mess. While I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as the original series I certainly didn't expect it to be as badly done as it was. Other than Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, the casting (in my opinion) was all wrong. This movie was sleazy and stupid. They made Jessica Simpson look and act like trash as Daisy Duke -- Catherine Bach never seemed so sleazy... she was innocent and cute/pretty. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville were totally bafoonish...just awful! The original Bo and Luke Duke (John Schneider and Tom Wopat) were smart, sweet and mischeivious in an innocent way. The only thing original about this movie was the General Lee...Sleazy and stupid. So not worth the price of admission or the price of a DVD. Watch this on cable and call it a day. You are missing nothing!"
1,unrated?,"I'm confused. This is the ""unrated"" release... and it's rated PG-13? My little cousin could watch this legally. The movie was ok, but this flat out lie of ""unrated"" makes me want to do anything but buy it."
4,What were you expecting?,"I'm sick of all the haters reviewing this movie. Most of them were fans of the show, and that explains a lot. Did you SERIOUSLY expect a remake of Dukes with Jessica Simpson, Johnny Knoxville, and Seann William Scott to be anything like the original show? It's a completely different time now, and the movie is going to be a lot different from the show you remember. If it's so bad and you expected it to be, why did you see it in the first place?I was never a fan of the show, I only went to see the movie because of Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson, who I'm big fans of (both). Simpson wasn't horrible, but she wasn't a reason in herself to see the movie. Scott, however, was hilarious! The best and funniest parts of the movie were all him.I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't expect this to be like the original show. It was a great movie, but if you were a fan and don't want a rude shock, don't see it."
4,The Dukes of Hazzard (Unrated Widescreen Edition),"I loved the movie,Willie Nelson is fabulous as Uncle Jessie !!"
2,Some funny parts but mostly junk,"I didn't expect much when i went to see this film and i got what i expected. Pros- Some funny moments, Knoxville was funny, Jessica Simpson is hot.Cons- Lame Jokes, god-awful plot, talentless Jessica Simpson, pointless everything.Overall not much to be desired and i regretted wasting my money seeing it."
2,Don't go if you are a Dukes of Hazard fan,"If you were a Dukes of Hazard fan of the TV Series, you will not enjoy this movie. The Dukes really play stupid roles. Jessica Simpson doesn't do much at all but she is cute. She worked really hard to get in shape and it shows. If you do decide to watch this movie, check out Jessica and Willie Nelson's music video. Jessica looks great in those shorts! Willie is cool as always in this movie and in the video. Willie is Willie. There are a lot of car jumps. In fact, it seems that is all this movie is about."
1,Nothing like the original,If you are a fan of the original movie - DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The only thing similar between this movie and the tv show are the character names.
1,Horrible,This movie doesn't even remotely run along the same lines as the classic Dukes Of Hazzard. We turned it off after 30 minutes and it's now sitting in the trash. Way too much cussing and since when does Jessie Duke smoke pot?
2,Terrible Movie with Good Car Chases!,"Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville star as Luke and Bo Duke who are in a race to save Uncle Jesse's Farm from the evil developer Boss Hogg and Sheriff Bosco.There is hardly any funny moments in this movie. There is a cheap cameo of the ""supertroopers"" character and this felt like a Broken Lizard movie with all the actors; after all, the director is one of the Broken Lizard guys. Unfortunately, this movie was beginning to bore me and it's only 95 minutes. The only good scenes were the chases as you see some fantastic stunt driving and drifting.This time I agree with the critics, this is a terrible TV remake!!"
2,Jessica Simpson,Not that impressed. The movie was a gift for my stepsons and it was broke on the bottom of case. Luckily they haven't seen it. Thank you anyway. The movie plays great.
1,Just an all-around bad movie.,"Poorly done on many counts. Bad acting, thin plotline, and characters that weren't true to the original characters in the TV show."
2,This movie sucks!,"okay i admit, this movie isnt insanely horrible, its just not good. I havent seen the originals though. Ive seen the unrated and rated cuts (im 15) and i can honestly say the rated version is better. I may be a guy and i like seeing naked girls and everything... but the cussing and nudity take away the family and dating value of this movie. If my girlfriend and I were to go see a movie at the theatre, it definately wouldn't be like this unrated version. It just seems very immorral and cuts down on the enjoyability. The acting isn't horrible, but not great. The scenes are somewhat funny, but other movies are way better. If you're a fan of the old one, you won't want to buy this. And get the rated version if you rent it. The unrated version is just too much."
2,Didn't Pay For This!,"Thank God I didn't pay to see this movie! I paid to see ""Red Eye,"" sat through it, and loved it. After that, I sneaked in to the theater for the Dukes, and I shouldn't have wasted my time. In the first scene, the General Lee is shown, but why is ""Bo"" opening and closing the door to get in and out??? If you think about the series, once the General Lee becomes a race car, the doors are WELDED SHUT, for that reason. Not because Cooter couldn't repair the doors after an accident, as what the movie explains. Cooter was the best mechanic in Hazzard -- he could fix ANYTHING. Don't waste your time with this film."
2,Too long and boring,"I really liked the original TV show-that was must-see TV when I was in high school! But I was disappointed with this movie. It felt like one long car chase with a couple of fights thrown in. Oh and Jessica Simpson is not that hot, but at least she didn't embarass herself. I usually like Sean William Sciott, but he was just OK. I loved Johnny Knoxville in MTV's Jackass and he did OK in this as well. I had to hit the fast forward bitton several times just to get through this one. Although the HD DVD transfer is really good, this is not even worth renting."
2,"they ruined a good show with the movie, and made it worse with unrated","I loved the show. the PG 13 version is ok, a decent tribute to the original. but then they completely messed it up with the unrated version. the Dukes would never use the explicit language, and women do not just hang around naked (at least not in America.) Unrated just goes too far."
1,Review of Dukes of Harrard,This movie was a joke. Being a Dukes of Hazzard fan since I was a little boy this was not what i expected. Save your money people and buy something else. This movie was the worst I have seen in a long time.
1,"bad retailer, bad movie","movie was sent unformatted!!! had to pay shipping both ways. bad retailer, don't buy from this place!!!!!!!!! retailer was mango64"
3,Crazy story,"The movie for me had some funny moments but I had to abandon all notion that this movie could be based in the real world to get through it. The two main characters commit so many felonies, it's unbelievable that they are pardoned for everything they've done by the end. Seeing their car fishtail for the 200th time kind of drove me nuts too. Overall, worth a rent, but that's it. :)"
2,Eh.,"Stupid and boring.Thats all there is to it really.I've never seen the tv show version,but hopefully it is a lot better than this remake.It gets two stars because the boys are good looking."
1,NOTHING LIKE THE TV SHOW EXCEPT FOR THE STUNTS,"The stunts were cool. That is the only good thing that could be said about this movie. The movie was garabage and not worth watching. All of the characters need their mouths washed out with soap. Nobody in the original series would have used God's name in vain. This movie had unneccessary filthy language throughout. Not suitable for children. An extremely bad excuse for what could and should have been an awesome movie. I was embarrassed and wish I had not wasted my money on something I will never watch again or let anyone borrow. Are there any decent people in Hollywood anymore that make good, clean, fun-loving, silly shows without being filthy? The Dukes of Hazzard TV series was successful because it was mostly clean fun!!!!! This movie should have been the same but sadly was not!!!!!"
5,dukes of hazard unrated,Absolutely amazing! I have no idea how the did the car stunts!I would recomend it to anyone who likes a good.
1,I foresaw this,"As soon as this piece of crap was released in theaters, I knew the dvd would come out with a ""unrated"" version. Why are dvds always releasing ""unrated"" wild versions of crappy movies? Too see more boobs and cuss words? WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Johnny Knoxville is the worst actor since Tom Green, but it seems everyone loves to see this guy, Sean Williams Scott 15 minutes are past, and Jessica Simpson just wants the attention. The tv show was wholesome, but like the world today, nothing is left sacred."
3,Stick to PG-13!,"This review is meant for the unrated DVD release. I purchased this because I thoroughly enjoyed the TV show and went to the theater two or three times to see this movie. However, this UNRATED edition is terrible.It took what was a fairly descent film, and turned it into a Solid R flick. It contains a lot more instances of the ""F"" word and a lot of nudity. (None of which involving Jessica Simpson). There are also several scenes that were changed that the PG-13 version was much better at sticking to the story.However, there were some good qualities with this version. there is one additional scene that helped the story. This scene is with Uncle Jesse going to Boss Hogg and asking questions and he punches Boss Hogg Out! Other than this scene it was not as good as the original cut!"
2,This is comedy???,"OMG!! What a waste of time this movie is...no talent between these actors at all...I can see that Burt Renyolds is really trying to make a comeback from the 70's but it just is not going to happen if he continues to select these kind of pictures to star in...cameo or not!! Terrible...this movie was not the least bit funny...and yeah there is the eye candy of Jessica Simpson, the one that cannot decide if Chicken of the Sea tuna is Chicken or Tuna!!! I wonder where in the hang comedy has gone...this is not comedy in the least...just another hyped up movie that lost steam really fast...."
2,"A ""Parental Version"" might have been fun to watch.","Seann William Scott is starting to grow on me as an actor. He is the one of the shinning lights in this movie that could have been 3 or 3 1/2 stars with out the nudity and foul langauge. He was fun in the ROCK movie RUNDOWN where he did where he did a semi-imitation of the ""ROY"" chareacter from SHANGHAI NOON.We rented this movie because my eight year daughter likes Jessica Simpson. Good call Jessie S appearing in a movie like this so my daughter can get exposed to the F bombs and topless nudity... unless her target market is being switched to young men who like swearing and bare naked ladys.Those non-minor complaints asside, the rest of the movie is fun. I liked well done driving scenes and stunts, and the General Lee was lookin good.Not a family movie."
2,A pointless movie where the trailer gives all the good parts,I have never watched the show but seen the movie becouse of Jessica Simpson and I think almost everyone else did the same. I found the movie to be very pointless and went to where fast. The begging was good but it went down hill fast. The acting was ok I liked Wille Nelson and Burt Reynolds. All the good parts where on the trailer. The movie I found was boring and had a few laughs. It was not good and wast of time.
1,The Real Dukes Would Have Run Away............,"This movie was nothing like the tv show. It was totally disrespectfully to all the dukes and especially boss hogg. Am I really supposed to believe that after all this time Boss Hogg grew? I mean they couldn't find someone to match the size of the original Boss. And Rosco in this movie was just creppy and not funny at all. In all of hollywood they couldn't find a funny guy to play Rosco. Jessica's portrayal of Daisy was horrible; and to tell you the truth she did not fill out the shorts that well either, SHE HAS NO BUTT!!! Do not waste your money to buy this movie. Rent it if you like, but don't buy!"
2,Nothing really like the original,"This movie version is really nothing like Dukes TV show. Its ok for what it is but the TV show was better. I like Johnny Knoxville so Id say its more for a Jackass fan than Dukes fan. The Fifth Season of the REAL Dukes DVD set is due out next week buy it instead! Or buy a set of Seasons one through Four out now. But if you really want to seee it this is the ""unrated"" version and if you don't want a kid under 13 to see it buy the rated version which was at the theater which is out too."
2,"IT'S FUNNY, BUT IT'S ALSO CRUDE AND STUPID","I wanted desperately to like this movie, so I would have put up with a whole lot of senseless stupidity but what I got was so incredibly dumb it cost me millions of brain cells. There are laughs to be had though only mixed in between gratuitous naked bodies, muddled storylines and performances that were more parody than anything. The movie version has precious little to do with the original show except an orange car and characters who share the same names as players on the CBS series. The Duke cousins are hardly recognizable and Uncle Jesse is turned into a raging hippie hick with nary an ounce of the level headed wisdom he had on television. This is pure bologna. I loathe myself for ever buying this load of trash. My money would have been better spent on Kenny G cassette tapes."
1,PUT OUT YOUR DUKES,"LET'S FACE IT...THE DUKES OF HAZZARD wasn't the best tv show ever aired, and I was always surprised it lasted five seasons. But the tv series had John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Catherine Bach, Sorrell Booke, James Best and Denver Pyle---who no matter how bad the script, they infused it with life and a certain love for their characters.Not so in this unnecessary transfer to the big screen. Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott have little or no chemistry; Jessica Simpson merely fills the babe factor; and Burt Reynolds and Willie Nelson should be ashamed of themselves for even participating. The General Lee as always steals the show but even the frequent car histrionics can't save this really bad film."
2,Good Old Boys NOT!!!!,"If it were not for the ""star car"" and some of the wild stunts it did, espcailly it taking a dive on the highway in Atlanta, it be the only thing the film has going for it. I could not stand Johnny Knoxville as Bo Duke, he looked more like a jerk in the whole film, and to have him that obsessed over the General Lee. Oh please the original Dukes were not that stupid, or that horny for that matter , and don't get me started on Dasiy Duke who by the way looked like a cheap tart in scanties cut even shroter than the original Dasiy Duke whom was more of a lady than Jessica whats her face. The whole film was really badly miscast, and was more graphic than the series that it was based on. I did recall that Ben Jones did not like the Dukes movie due to it being far from the orginal, and i would say the same."
5,Lets Put Another Shrimp on the Barbie!,"This is so far the best time I have had at the movies this year. It is funny and has lots of action. Sean William Scott has some great lines as does Johnny Knoxville from Jackass. They are equally funny as most of the movie follows them and what they do to save the Duke Family. Jessica Simpson is hot. Her talent shown in the movie is at the max. Her acting talent is another story. She almost manages to use ""Hey Yall"" correctly. The cast also includes Willie Nelson and Burt Reynolds.Aside from actors, the action scenes vary from car chases to fight scenes at a bar. Very entertaining. The Dukes are in constant trouble with the Sheriff. Somehow they always manage to outsmart him. I won't say much more of the plot. The Dukes of Hazzard is awesome. Yeehaw"
4,UNRATED? LANGUAGE? NUDITY? Not sure bout that but i noe theres HILLBILLYS,"This is coming out in unrated version like american wedding and road trip. I saw this movie with my little brother, he thought it was stupid so did I. The racing scenes were really long and it wasnt really funny. So since it wasnt that great they decide to release it in unrated version to make more money of it."
4,Eye Candy,"Why did Jay Chandrasekar (spelled so wrongly) make a PG-13 movie? Broken Lizard makes excellent movies...period. This movie is hilarious, but you have to suspend reality. Seeing Stifler fly across the bar with that ridiculous helmet on, and Johnny Knoxvilles pig nosed snout curled up in redneck delight is so fitting. And the fact that Cooter is named Cooter because we all know what a cooter is, is awesome. So sit back, drink a six pack, and enjoy watching Nicks wife walk around showing Cooter, her backside."
3,Not bad - General Lee steals the movie,I never watched the TV show which is probably why I liked the movie. It seems fans of the show were unimpressed by the movie. Anything with Seann William Scott in it is usually a good movie and this is no exception. There are enough funny moments in here to keep you entertained and Johnny Knoxville proves he is a competent actor while not being great. Burt Reynolds is perfect as Boss Hogg and there isa couple of funny performances by Michael Weston and M.C Gainey. But the star of the movie is the General Lee. What a nice a car and excellent car chase scenes. And I must say I think Jessica Simpson is highly overated. All she proves in this movie is she is completely untalented. Although I am aware she wasn't cast as Daisy Duke for her acting.
2,Terrible,"Ruining a classic show, that was what they were trying to do? Well, they did. The jack-ass guy is funny, as is the other. I used to like Jessica, but she can't act. She's a singer. Celebrities should stay within their realm and not vtry other things because it makes them look dumb. People put them on a pedestal and they should act within the pedestal they are put upon.On a personal note, celebrities should not be allowed to be married w/o major psych counseling. Tom Cruise would not have passed. Jessica & Nick looked happy, but now they are just ruining their lives and their careers. I don't think Jess will bounce back from this. It will be the end. Who wants to trust people who cannot even be married? The whole marriage system in the U.S. is now ruined due to these celebrities. There are some..Tom Hanks/Rita Wilson that are examples of classic marriage. Others..well enough said."
2,Nothing like the show,It was one of those movies that you can shut off your mind and just watch. It wasn't bad yet it wasn't good either. Johnny Knoxville seems he should have been Jack Nicholson's goofy son (just in general because of the way he looks)...that's not a good thing. And Jessica Simpson is very pretty but lacking any real personality. I can't help but think talking to her would be boring. Seann William Scott was the bright spot in this lackluster film (the car crashes were the stars).
1,should be avoided at all costs!,"This is the dumbest movie I have seen in a long time. Nothing like the series. The plot is stupid. Bo and Luke are portrayed as a couple of bumbling idiots - in the series that were actually pretty smart guys.Roscoe is just evil. Boss Hog would have been better if they cast Danny DeVito. Burt Reynolds is good though. Enos is the only character that was pretty close to the original. Uncle Jesse is portrayed as a crass, drug smoking moonshine runner with no morals. Still, he is probably the funniest character in the movie. Willie Nelson was good for this role. Jessica is super sexy, of course - some say the movie is worth watching just for her, the jury is still out on that one.The General Lee is an awesome car for muscle car owners, but most of the movie is hellbent on destroying it. What a waste!Lots of nudity thrown in for some reason.It is no wonder none of the original cast wanted anything to do with this movie.I'd take a pass on this one."
1,no stars if i could,This movie is not available in PG-13 widescreen so I bought the unrated widescreen thinking if I didn't watch the unrated extras it would be ok. I was wrong. It ended up being a rated R version with Nudity and lots of swearing. Do not buy if you haved kids and do not buy because it plain sucks. I will never give my money to an unrated film again. I grew up on the Dukes of Hazzard and love all the seasons and could not wait for the movie. But now I can't wait to burn my DVD.
1,The Worst Movie of 2005,Dukes of Hazzard was the single worst movie of 2005. It was absolutely horrible in practically every respect. Worst of all was the presence of Jessica Simpson who was the worst actress in a starring role in all of 2005. Dukes of Hazzard is proof that some things from the decade of the 1970's do not deserve a comeback.
1,Complete Waste of Brain Cells and Time,Run Away!Run Away Now!Save Yourself from the Worst Ever Made!No Joke!Run!
1,ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!,"As a fan of the original series, I never once planned to see this film. Not for the poor casting (the only one who resembled anyone from the original was the General Lee), the rehashed plot, or the fact that Hollywood has taken a once good and decent show and added alot of sex and profanity to it, but for the simple fact that Jessica Simpson should never be allowed in front of a movie camera. Joe Simpson, if you're reading this review, please stop bombarding your idiot daughter upon our society!!!"
1,Horrible Film,"I use to like the Tv show back in the day,but this film was straight up garbage. nothing seem to work or fit. no chemistry&this film seems to have gotten it's cues in places from Larry ""The Cable Guy"". the Tv show was so well paced&everything on there fit like a glove. the writing&overall direction of this film is a Mess. I finally got to see this film the other night&I see why i had avoided it for as long as I did."
2,Not So Good,"This movie isnt so good. It dosent share anything with the DUKES OF HAZZARD seires. The only thing thats kool about this movie is the GENERAL LEE speeding, drifting, and jumping. the rest is isnt so hot. In the seires Bo and Luke never cursed and Uncle Jesse would never call Rosco a fat sack of [...]. Thats another thing. Rosco was stupid and funny in the seires but in this movie hes mean. And Boss Hogg isnt fat. And Bo and Luke look more like city boys instead of country boys. Theres lots of things wrong with this movie. So who ever is about to buy this movie I sugust you rent it first."
5,This book brought back the exciting memories of early rap,"I saw this book at my chiropractor's office and wanted to slip it in my bag. So glad Ricky put these sincerely taken photos out in the public. The subjects never seem tricked into posing they seem more spontaneous and free , just like the mood of the music at that time . I miss that."
1,BIG LET DOWN- THIS BOOK SUCKS,"It's really kinda sad since we all know ricky powell is an amazing character (just maybe not really a photographer) and been in some amazing places when it was important to be there, but this book is WACK, the photos and layout suck. I feel bad for the rickster , he must have better shots than these he's saving for another project."
3,"Homeboy, throw in the towel........","Not a bad book. Some cool Beastie Boys photos and a few Run DMC pics as well. Sure, there are other 80's rappers in here, but it is mainly comprised of Beastie/DMC shots. Ricky was one lucky dude. I remember him during the Check Your Head tour soundcheck in '92 (in Mesa, Az). He asked all lesbian girls to meet him at the side of the stage after the show. He also ran around the Beasties with a camcorder during the show. Lucky man.....Good book for the price."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!! COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!!,"I can't beleive I spent over 43.00 for an item that was completely FALSE ADVERTISED!!!! I opened the package and saw that the FM TransCharger was a COMPLETE DIFFERENT item than that pictured on Amazon. I've must've been the unluncky one that received a GENERIC VERSION of this item. Even the package was generic. I tried to be optimistic but was only disappointed to find out the transmitter was staticky and had very poor sound quality on all stations!! I learned my lesson with this one.....Unless you want to be RIPPED OFF, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Very Very Bad,Pathetic quality of the pictures.This is a really poor work.Don't waiste your time and money.
4,Heat Exchanger Design Handbook - Part 5- Physical Properties,I acquired the present book to complement information that I need to teach Heat Transmission in Mauá Engineering School (So Paulo-Brazil). The content of the book is excellent presenting technical information that allow us to estimate physical properties of having pure fluids or Hydrocarbons and Nonhydrocarbons mixture of fluids. At the end of the book it is presented physical properties of a series of very frequent fluids used in heating and refrigerating processes. I will classify this book as very good book. I will indicate it as professional reference to my students and to other fiends that work with Heat Transmission..
2,"Outdated, some useful fundamentals","While the book contains tried-and-true tactics that will always work, it is outdated and not thorough enough. No mention, for example, on dropshot, splitshot, or swimbait techniques. Very brief mention of casting techniques, and nothing about pitching. All of the B&W photos look like the fishermen were going to a screening of ""Saturday Night Fever"" once they got off the lake. The book was ""updated"" by Mark Hicks, who never hesitates to include photos and stories of himself, a no-no in the unwritten rules of authors. I should have spent my money on Roland Martin's or Van Dam's books."
3,Read all this before.,"This book is well written and would do the newbie well as it covers the basics and some advanced. Not as well written as anything ""Uncle Homer"" would say, but it has solid info."
4,A must for the digital artist,"Painter is *the* tool for creating the look and feel of natural media in a digital environment. Having upgraded from Painter classic, the new features at my disposal were breathtaking.A tablet is practically a prerequisite to take full advantage of the program. I'm using the cheap $100 6x8 Graphire, but I understand a Wacom Intuos will add the program's ability to determine which way your pen is tilted and whether you swivel the pen or not.I've made the switch from working in natural media to working 100% digital a couple of years back - but the switch would not have been possible without Painter."
3,"Beautifully written, bad philosophy","Sartre seems to have made a point in his life obscuring his philosophical standpoints by giving sparse and rather farfetched metaphorical argumentation.I kept on thinking Antoine Roquentin was having a crazy, paranoid trip; not that he was realizing absurdity of life. This is accentuated by hallucinatory descriptions of the world. When he finally realizes, I was inclined to slap him around, scream 'DUH'. He's whiny all the way through, though I still found him rather likeable. Yet I hated his criticism of other people, like he was saying ""nothing matters, but I still thoroughly hate everyone who I think disagrees like it does matter"", unconvincingly portraying realists or idealists like infantile fats. But I guess those were different times.There's not much of a plot in here, but I enjoyed the Autodidact's character and the pure literary aspect of it. By way of philosophy it's rather weak. It makes me glad analytic philosophy happened."
2,"nice idea, but he obivously wasn't concerned with readiblity","The whole existentialist angst thing is great, it really is, and this novel is a very effective presentation of existential ideas. However, it has to be the most boring thing ever written. Driest prose I ever did read, though I assume it was partly the translastion."
5,Lean and trim existentialism by sartre,One of the books that Ive read more than once. Its a book I read out of boredom and found it being better than anything I had read before that. Great book.
4,I'm Speachless.,"I was recommended this book by a my highschool teacher. I came into the book a bit intimidated and unsure of the intellectual capacity needed. Surprisingly I picked it up immediately and understood everything that Roquentin felt. It's the same feeling as if when you repeat a word over and over again to the point that it no longer sounds like a word. Existentialism is a strange feeling of confusion and loneliness. You begin to question everything around you actually experience a nauseating pit in your stomach. On any level, the book, regardless of literary criticism, moved me deeply. I found myself, every ten pages or so, underlining Sartre's mind-boggling descriptions. Read it."
3,"Interesting, but frustrating","Although I would not say that I am uninterested in philosophy, it is not a subject to which I have given a great deal of attention. Therefore, I may not be the best audience for this literary explication of existentialism. Having said that, I found Satre's prose frequently evocative, but his hero, Roquentin, was extremely frustrating. Indeed, his bouts of existentialist horror triggered by such everyday realia as chairs, trees, and hands made me wonder whether he was mentally disturbed. Of course, I don't believe that all existentialists are insane, but I do wonder which came first, the chicken or the egg--is this philosophy a clear-eyed look at reality that naturally leads to ennui, or is it a rationale for inaction and fear constructed by highly intelligent depressives? Perhaps Woody Allen said it best: ""The mind is the most over-rated organ in the body."" If it makes us catatonic with horror at the sight of a tree, then ignorance really is bliss."
3,Eh...,"If you've read Sartre, then I don't think there are any surprises to be found here. Similar motifs at work, it's just I thought this would be a little more interesting than what it ended up being. Again, if you are a Sartre fan, then you will probably enjoy this book, but I don't know if you will learn anything new from it. If you haven't ever read Sartre, then don't start here. Maybe try No Exit."
2,There's a reason why we remember him for his plays...,"There is a very good reason why we adore Sarte for his plays, simply: they are better. This 'novel' or treatise, or manifesto, or journal, or however you choose to classify this work...is well boring. Very boring. I don't understand people...I mean, if you want to share your thoughts, ideas, theories maybe even an answer to the quiz that is life with your fellow man. isn't simplicity the best answer?I believe ulitmately this work derailed Sarte's purpose."
3,Solitude drives you crazy.,"I doubt that's what Sartre intended as the moral of his book, but that's what I got out of it. Anyone would go crazy after living without meaningful relationships for 4 years. People who are totally alone don't have a clearer conception of the world than other people - they have a distorted understanding. Objects are grotesque and absurd when they exist in isolation ; they become meaningful through relationships with other objects."
2,Just too boring,It is difficult to call this a novel as the plot seems non-existent. I must confess I was too bored after 50 pages or so to finish the book. It does present important philosophical ideas but you might be better off either reading the philosophy of existentialism or reading novels by authors like Camus or Kafka.
2,what was the point?,"do you exist simply because you live or because of what you do? i found the main character to be utterly hopeless and bleak...he had goals and he just couldn't complete them...he had a meaningless relationship. sartre seems to delight in seeing just how much he can gross people out...i finished the book only because it was like watching a train wreck. no matter how gauche it was, i couldn't turn away.yet, i wonder if picking up his book was worth the trouble...i have read camus and had only a mild interest in exstitentialism. i'll probably read no exit.. but its unlikely i'll read this one again...."
2,"Don't know about the cakes, but the customer service sucks","I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15. As of January 5, they still did not receive the card noticing them of the gift. When I called flying noodle, they gave me the brush off, saying that they could resend a notice to me (not doing me any good being 3000 miles away) or could resend them the card for a $5 fee. I told them that was unacceptable and had to actually ask for a manager to get anything straightened out. It almost doesn't matter how good the cakes or other products are if the company is unreliable."
1,Missing a lot,"I have had to contact Haynes to get additional information that we needed that isn't in the book. Yes, they can provide it. But a complete book would have had it in it."
3,saomewhat helpful,I find that all the Haynes manuals are somewhat helpful but leave out much detail that would be needed in a true repair manual.they waste space telling how to remove a door for example and don't have room to tell much more important info such as location of replacement items on the engine and other such items.Also the index is very skimpy leaving it up to the user to hunt for sections that contain info (and often very little info.) about the item you are looking for!.
3,"Great mechanical advice, could include more electrical and body instructions","As many books of this series the mechanical portion about engine, drivetrain and wheel assemblies is great. It could contain a more comprehensive body and electrical content."
3,A useful fix and repair guide that covers a lot of models,"A good general guide that is spoiled by trying to cover as many models as possible in as few pages as possible.One section may cover your van but be wary of moving from say cooling to transmission. The text does indicate differences but if you are not careful you could be checking the wrong tolerance or looking at a photo of a part belonging to a different model. The assumption and recommendation is also that you buy quite a few ""one use"" tools that the average home mechanic does not need and would not own. I have used this guide once to help me figure out how to work on the power steering and that has already more than paid for it."
2,Book condition,"The condition of the book was way less than advertised. It was said to be in good condition, but it has torn pages, water spots and oil on many of the pages. I would rate as fair condition at best. I have purchased several other books of this nature and they were in far better condition the this one even if used."
5,Resuce Me Review,"Item was as advertised. The only negative was the case the series came in. Instead of individual sleeves the disks come in a box stacked on top of each other. So, when you want a certain disk you have to sort through all of them to find the disk you want. Small inconvenience though. Would definitely use seller again."
5,Love it!,Denis Leary at his best. Watched the series on television and had to have it for my library. Thank you Denis!
3,"Finally, released as an entire boxset....","......but, what a crappy way to package it! Two spindles with no scratch protection for a pile of disks? Seems like they could have done a way better job of packaging this....maybe something clever like a fire engine or fire hydrant with the disks in individual sleeves or something, just seems like a weak way to package the entire set of such a good show."
2,"MISSING ONE DISC, SUB-STANDARD PACKAGING","Sadly, the discs are simply stacked on a spool without any protective covering between the DVD discs. Season One Disc Two was missing completely. Labeling of seasons and episodes is inconsistent. I am seeking to return this entire shipment. Very inadequate for so wonderful a series. I concur fully with other customers about so superb a show being packaged so poorly! UPDATE- I am pleased to report that all the DVDs thus far are undamaged despite the packaging. Yes, the price was great, but its a superb series and it deserved more protection."
1,Great series. Horrible Packaging,Set came with CDs all stacked on top of one another with nothing in between them. Have to unstack them to find the disc you want. No details sheet to tell you what's on the discs. Just CHEAP CHEAP substandard joke of a package.
1,"LOVE this show, but the way this was handled is just wrong","If you're considering this, you've already seen the show, or you're a fan. It's a great show, of that there is no doubt.The problem with this is the packaging. It is so horrible that the entire thing is just unprotected.Would you just throw your discs together somewhere, leaving them unprotected? That's exactly what the individuals behind this product expect you to do. Two separate 'halves' of the box, each have a spindle to put your disc in, collecting them in a group. Talk about a huge, huge mess, and massive problems when it comes to keeping discs protected.A+++++ for the showF----- for the packaging!"
3,3* overall,"I must agree with what J. Sohl, another reviewer, said about the packaging, it has a nice outer shell, but the discs stacked on top of one another, & what they're contained it...extremely cheap. At least I got it on sale, so thanks Amazon. Also, there are no Setup options for sound, language, or subtitles that I found. Thankfully closed captioning is, but I still see the lack of the Setup options as a downer.Anyway, I adore the first three seasons, so fun, dramatic, raw...& continued watching even when I felt there was no progress to the life of Tommy Gavin, or felt the humor became slapstickish. I'm hoping to enjoy the entire series more without having to deal with any commercials, or waits between seasons!All in all, 3 to 3.5 stars is what I give!"
2,Good product but size is totally off...,"Your sizes are totally screwed up. I thought size small is supposed to be small, not huge. the one (size s) i got was a little bigger even for me, and i am 6 feet tall and I weight 180 pounds. put there on the website actual measurements of sizes not s m or xl. i don't even wanna know how big the XL is... maybe for a couple of people to fit in... :) . anyway... Good product but size is totally off..."
5,Great book,Tom Christenson's book is a wonderful resource for philosophy novices as well as seasoned students who are looking for an overview of their studies.
2,Mediocre,"Yet another book that resulted out of Class Notes ! Don't waste your money buying this book if you want to learn applied functional analysis. This book is meant solely for those students who have registered for Leszek's Class at UT, Austin."
5,A fun and helpful read for every hunter,"Of all the hunting books I've collected this is one of my favorites and a great read. There is history, but also what to use for what game. I even bought my first chronograph after reading this book so I could test my bullet speed. If you are a hunter the section on zeroing in your gun (i.e. how far you want the bullet to fall if you shoot further than your zero point where the gun is right on) is important. Overall a knowledge of ballistics will help not only your hunting skills, but your enjoyment of hunting. Check outThe ABC's of Reloadingtoo."
5,"The EMPRESS is alive and well -- in WASHINGTON, D.C. and ABROAD","This is a tremendous ""fictional"" book, deep with insight, political savvy, and is a very accurate parallel to specific characters in real life.The characterizations are excellent. Hillary Clinton is clearly and accurately depicted, as well as Bill (""Slick Willy"" and ""Teflon Bill"" as he was known) Clinton. China's relationship, and behind the scenes control, are evident, and my friends, they still are a major player liberals, staunchly behind Hillary to this day.""THE EMPRESS PROJECT"" should be Political Science 101. Get a copy or several copies, and see that people in your realm of influence READ this book.These are definitely characters you DO know. It's one of the very best ""fiction"" novels I have ever read in 70 years."
3,coil spring booster,this item is use to bring up my front end of my car.which it did a little. im happy with it thanks again.will do business again.
5,Russian Nesting Dolls in all their glory,"If you are a serious collector of dolls, especially the Russian nesting dolls called ""Matryoshka"", then this book is for you. This slim volume makes up for its size by being filled with wonderful color photos of incredible, one-of-a-kind art dolls. The painted doll styles are varied and amazing. These are not the typical Russian nesting dolls found in souvenir shops, but truly works of art created by really talented artists."
4,"Designed for developers, not just DBAs ...","I noticed someone bought it for Oracle installation, and then gave it 1 star because _he_ failed to read the front cover. This book is not an installation guide to a single database. Oracle has some excellent documentation that covers the installation of its products.This is an ""all-in-one book"" for sysadmins, DBAs _and_ developers who wish to deplay MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle 8i. As such, not only does it cover installation, but SQL, various front-ends like ODBC and JDBC as well as securing databases on Linux. It's not going to go into vendor-specific development tools and administration, but general SQL administration, and Linux-centric capabilities.If you want a book on Oracle on Linux, go buy an Oracle manual. If you want a general, ""all-in-one book"" for databases on Linux, from DBA to development, this is a fairly good one."
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping for some guidelines to help with the installation of Oracle on Linux but found very little useful information in this book.Unfortunately the authors chose to spend much of their time instead on SQL and relational basics -- which, whatever their strengths may be, is clearly their weakness. For example, while discussing ""relationship theory"" (surely meaning ""Relational Theory"") the author of chapter 9 incorrectly defined 1st Normal Form as a ""one-to-many relationship"" and 2nd Normal Form as a ""one-to-one relationship"" between tables.The rest of what I read -- I didn't have the patience to read much more -- wasn't much better."
3,Way too much conjecture and post conquest Mexico History,"Unlike his book ""Mysteries of the Egyptian Pyramids"" Tompkins spends the first half of this book reviewing Conquest and Post Conquest history of Mexico without giving more information on the subject matter. The first half of the book hardly mentions Teotihuacan at all. Only chapters 16 and 17 get into Teotihuacan proper and then the rest of the book goes to speculation in the remaining chapters about the mathematical significance of measurements taken at Teotihuacan and tries to weave the city into Tompkins personal theories of Atlantis. I love history and read the first half of the book without a problem while waiting for any information on Teotihuacan. The last half of the book I couldn't finish as it got bogged down trying to link the builders of Teotihuacan with Atlantis. If you want information on Teotihuacan then this is not the book for you"
3,most underated Mac software,"Most underated Mac software, and I know why: it's bloody difficult, and I've yet to meet ANyone that actually can use it well. Sure, lots of keyboard shortcuts, but it's a powerful program without any books that explain what it does. Truly, I wouldn't use my Mac without it. But CE Software is missing the boat."
2,Disappointing,"The biography of Ivan Q. Spencer, founder of Elim Fellowship and as one of the few Pentecostal fathers to cross over to the Latter rain, a significant person. Unfortunately the writing style of the book leaves something to be desired. Rather than paint a warm and lifelike picture, we see Spencer as a hard man with an occasional lapse into being human. Moreover there is very little detail in areas that would be of historical significance such as Spencer's involvement in the Latter Rain and the path that Elim later took in the Charismatic movement."
4,It's a favorite,I took a chance and bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a coach and likes a watch wth a digital reading. He really likes the features it has and also received a exta battery with it.The only minor problem the band needs to be a tad bit longer for an adult mans wrist. I was impressed with the fast delivery too.
5,If you are a chemist you need this book!,"This is the definitive reference textbook on the subject. If you are a chemist, or if you run a chemistry lab, you need this book. By no means casual reading, but this book contains lots of information difficult to find anywhere else. It is all conveniently, centrally located in one book."
4,"Decent for the ""Not-so-Dedicated""","This book is a good collection of short stories for the aspiring SF reader. However, for the more serious that read such books as the Foundation series or Dune, it is in all respects, a book that grasped me for a select few stories."
1,Worst fax software on the market,"Our MCSE consultant spent 77 hours installing and dealing with their inept tech support. The final solution was a complete re-write of 5 of their program files (he'd already installed 5 separate and worthless patches). At the end, when we complained, they blamed our consultant and their lawyers sent us a nasty letter and a copy of their license agreement stating they were not to blame no matter what.If you buy this product please send us a check too, since we seemed to have been an intricate part of their R & D (costing us thousands of dollars).In all seriousness, stay away from this product.-Joe"
1,Really really horrible tasting,"This is my first (and I assure you last) experience with a liquid SJW extraction, but I've tried two different capsules in the past. those sometimes gave a funny ""hay-like"" aftertaste.I decided to try this extract instead because supposedly the pharmacological effects are more predictable with a liquid extract. I think I get less effect from it than the tablets and choking it down is very difficult because of the really terrible taste. I've tried mixing it with water (per the instructions) and also just dripping it straight down my throat, but either way its really a horrible awful terrible experience.Once again, this is the only liquid extract I've tried so I don't know how it compares to others, but compared to capsules and tablets I found the experience horrifying (after three days I've ordered capsules again)."
4,Great Cover,"This cover is very good , it's stylish and the phone from getting scratches and in my case when i had dropped a few times and the phone just bounces and leaves no marks or scratches. although, it covers the volume strip , but 90 % of people that i knew or know that has this phone don't even use the volume strip. I would definitly recommend this cover to anyone who has a Dash."
4,Black Silicon case for T-mobile Dash,The Case is wonderful except that for some reason it was made with the touchstrip covered. Further research showed that all of them are. Makes no sense why but a 10 minute operation and it worked perfectly.
3,T-Mobile Dash HTC s620 Excalibur rubber sleeve,It does what it needs to do but starts to wear and move around and the microphone gets covered giving the recipient a hard time listening.
2,Cingular sucks whatever it is called!,"This is my second contract with Cingular/now-AT&T.; When I had Cingular 4 years ago I was very dissatisfied with my connection in NYC. Then I went to T-Mobile and it was perfectly fine.Now I went to AT&T; for a good deal on the phone and I regret! Besides all that agressive advertisement the truth is AT&T; sucks! I feel upset when my friends talk on their phones in-doors, in evevator, etc. and I have to go outside and search for signal.I tried different AT&T; phones - the overall quality of the connection is low!"
5,Love this little pouch!,"I have been wearing this pouch every day for the last 9 months and couldn't be happier!I do not wear a duty belt, this goes right on my regular belt. The fit is a little tight at first, but it doesn't slide around and does exactly what it's supposed to do.I can keep 2 pairs of exam gloves with me at all times, and the snap is secure enough to hold without popping off all the time, but also easy enough to open when I need to get to the gloves in a hurry.Great product, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to carry gloves with them!"
3,"Decent, but not flexible","Got this item to hold nitrile gloves on me for my work in hospital security.The pouch holds firm, but unfortunately a bit too firm.I can fit comfortably 2 pairs of gloves in here, any more than that and it becomes bulky and difficult to snap shutThe main cause seems to be the material, it is synthetic and unfortunately lacks any give.There is a plastic bit on the back to hold to your belt, it works, but I find I actually have to loop my belt behind it because the plastic is flat and you can't (or at least I can't) fit a belt through the loops provided on it.Ovall the pouch does what it's supposed to, but for my job I find that 2 pairs of gloves often leaves me short."
4,"great for beginners, maybe not for advanced",I'm a beginner and I think pilates deck is really good. I have friends who are far more advanced with pilates and they weren't so impressed.I like to mix in the exercises fromThe 5-Second Flat Belly Secret - Lose 2-3 Inches from Your Belly in Less Than 1 Monthwith these pilates positions to get more focused work on losing my belly and that's been working out superb.
3,"For learners, this slow-as-mud method is not the solution.","Pros: Nice box, looks neat, clean, easy to stack. Few exercise accessories needed.Cons: Wordy, & it's in a tiny font size. Many/All strange-new exercises makes it difficult to follow along & get your exercise session done. I spent 5 minutes to learn and do each exercise, and you never really master each exercise. You try and try, but either your breathing isn't right, or you'll find something to make you stop & read each card each time you do that card's exercise. This is not the way to keep your body warm and your heart rate up during an exercise session. Amazon sent me a box that had its bar code striked out with a magic marker. Usually that is done at bookstores if the product was returned."
2,a little hard to follow,Too hard to try to follow instructions on the cards while performing the exercises. Won't be using this. Don't waste your money.
1,Terrible - Doesn't work,This is a terrible product that should be taken off the market. The digital image comes through as chicken scratch.
4,"quality writing on theatre, acting, and Shakespeare","Hazlitt's an early 19th century (Regency) writer and theatre critic. This book collects his reviews and descriptions of thetop actors of his day (Kean, Kemble, Siddons, ...) in Shakespearean and other roles. Frankly, he doesn't go into as much detail as I'd like, but what details he gives us of these classic performances, while not revolutionary are fun to envision, and give us an idea of the state of theatre at the time. He tends to drift off into raptures about a play or actor (or Shakespeare in general), but his enthusiasm is catching, and his language beautiful.Note that if you've read Hazlitt's ""Characters in Shakespeare's Plays"" some of the material will not be new to you, but enough is that I think if you enjoyed that, you'll want to read this too."
3,A Weak Option,"I purchased this book as a supplemental overview for a course. I found it to be vague and unclear. The style was surprisingly conversational for technical material and the fairly freeform structure of the text made it difficult to pick out relevant sections.If you are looking for a clarifying study guide, I would suggest that you continue with your search."
1,waste of money,"its a good book in all, but there are better books out there if you are looking to use it as a supplement for another text. check out schaum's outlines for signals and systems. it cost less and it has a lot of problems worked out at the end of the chapter. much more helpful than Signals and Systems Made Ridiculously Simple."
5,Young Lloyd is Off Da Chain!,"I just love this CD. I have only owned it one day and already have played it like 100 times! I was introduced to Lloyd only recently and have not been disappointed! Like a previous poster said he is definitely ""eye candy"" with his exotic looks and ""country boy"" charm. Hopefully he will have a very long career. This is the best CD I have purchased in years. I luv Lloyd's sexy smooth vocals and his body is bangin too!"
5,LOVE Street Love Shawty,"Lloyd, this is soooo hot! From front to back-beginning to end, love it! I am @ work & have played it over & over for hours."
4,Get It Lloyd,"I like this one. The beats are hot, the songs/lyrics are hot. It doesn't sound monotonous."
4,Dictionary Geotechnical Engineering,"As a geotechnical engineer from Germany, working for a US company, I fairly often use the above mentioned dictionary (actually i use the cd-rom version). It covers most of the geotechnical expressions to mining, earthwork,hydrology, foundation engineering, etc. The included database can be expanded as you want."
4,Great resource and inspirational too!,"Great concept and good execution, and decent range of artists/styles. Vector elements can be broken down/ungrouped so lots of versatility, and photos are good too. Fonts are just OK - not as helful as I'd hoped.Generally a good value-for-money clip art resource."
4,Glad this was a library book,"I borrowed this from the library. Glad I never read it to my own children way back when they were young. This is what I thought of this book:Deceit. The word that came to mind the most while reading this. Good try. But boring. And the womyn most often represented themselves as men to get to the prize which was most often to marry a man. Like I said, good try.Happily after leaves happy til later. Make your happiness and follow it. There isn't a someone to complete you. There might be someone to walk with. Walk in honesty. Those are the values I would love to see in all books not just in making the girls feel more equal books.On Free to Be You and Me the video (remember those?) there was the story of the girl who raced, but not to marry. Those were the staples of my children's input diets. Race to feel the wind. Race to meet others who like to race. Make friends. But remain yourself and stay honest."
1,Way too violent,"This book has a great title, but that's about it. My 10 year old daughter thought the stories were boring. We were very surprised by the amount of violence in these stories, and cannot recommend the book for that reason."
1,Who was this written for?,The writing style was VERY dry and the page layout made the stories seem much too long. I found myself losing interest and not following the story; there was no way I could give this to a 8 year old.
3,I loved this bbook,"I loved reading this book when I was a kid. If you think it doesn't have enough life in the heroes, or the boys are shown as week, you should try Young Warriors, a collection of short stories by different people and edited by Tamora Pierce- but be warned, this is a teen book!"
1,"After just 9 months, this espresso machine is trashed.","For first six months, the machine worked great. I liked its ease of use, great crema and fast steam, even though it is too short for standard espresso cup or steamer pitcher [I use a small measuring cup]. A few months ago, the machine started 'binding up' and did not steam through in less than 20 minutes, much less produce crema, and now it also pours hot water over the top of the portable filter and down the handle -- I cannot make espresso without surrounding the machine with towels! Have cleaned the machine according to the instructions and dismantled the filters to clean by hand. To replace it, Delonghi's 'warranty' requires the customer to cut the power cord and mail it to them with a $15 check for shipping the new machine. Will do it this time but if new machine fails like this one did, I'm putting Delonghi at the bottom of my respect list and not buying another of their espresso machines."
4,it works,"this model makes decent expresso. it is simple to use, and so far, has worked well. i have had a small problem with the steam wand. it will not take a proper small pitcher. Other small problems are propably mine rather than the machine"
4,Great value!,This is the best value for an espresso machine.Cons:1) The steam arm is a pain and pull towards you instead of staying out like it should - and nothing but a 8oz frothing mug will fit underneath it to swirl2) Nothing fits under the spouts except teeny espresso cups (unless...see below)Pros:1) Very good quality espresso2) Simple to use3) Relatively easy to clean4) Very low priceTips:1) take out the metal plate and put a single measuring cup in there to catch your double shot2) make sure to empty the water out the steam pipe for a few seconds before frothing3) use an instant read thermometer for your frothing as this machine gets the milk very hot very quickly (which is good)
3,Workable.,"Sturdy enough machine. Produces a workable cup of Espresso. Perhaps not the best, but unbeatable at this price. Would be a good compromise between cost and quality for the occasional user. If you want multiple shots of Espresso per day, perhaps a larger investment would be a good idea. Also buy a ""free standing"" tamper, the attached one is difficult to use in a consistent manner."
4,Very nice product....,It was hard to figure out the directions at first....usually one can just plug it in and figure it out....but not this time...make sure to read the directions before use! It makes a great cup of joe!
4,"Decent espresso maker, excellent value","I purchased this unit to fill in for a very expensive larger espresso maker I have that needs repair. I agree with most reviews that this little DeLonghi makes a very good cup of espresso, especially considering how inexpensive it is. The frothing wand is very easy to use and clean. The water container is easy to fill and remove.I have a couple of significant design complaints. First, the machine is so light weight that I can barely turn the espresso basket and handle without holding down the machine. It slips all over the counter. It sits so low on the counter that I have to practically stand on my head to see in order to thread the grounds holder onto the machine. There is barely enough room to place a large cappuccino cup under the brew area.Overall though, it is an excellent value and makes a decent cup of espresso."
3,Machine started leaking after 1.5 years,"Got this via amazon. Coffey quality is ok, machine is easy to operate and small enough to fit under my cabinet.After around a year and a half it started leaking from the bottom. Not sure why but it leaves peddles wherever it stands."
3,Bought 2 Delonghi Cappuccino,"Works, but noisy. Bought one for my sister and me. Frother works sometimes, but turns cold milk hot regardless if not foamy. My sister was experienced with this and other brands and liked this one best, even though it has a vibration noise."
4,Do I need to know when to stop?,"I just got the product and made my first espresso. The overall quality was OK. Reading the reviews I realize I need to experiment with a few things in order to make good espresso.But one thing I am not clear about - Will it stop on its own after a ""double shot"" when I put the bigger basket, or am I supposed to hang around and manually turn it off? If I have to hang around, when do I know a double shot is ready? Will it work if I put just the amount of water needed for a double shot? Or will not having water while it is still ""on"" cause some problems?Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer my question."
2,Too complicated,"I'm a die hard espresso addict who WANTED to love this machine, but neither my mother nor I could figure out how in the world to use it. It seems it only spewed out weak coffee, plus it leaked everywhere. Maybe someone else can learn to use it, but not us."
4,Nice & economical,"My very old machine died so I chose this one as a birthday gift in October. The handle doesn't turn to center like the photo shows, but seems to work fine. The coffee is good and fast (doesn't take 15 minutes to heat up like the instructions say.) I like that I can make more than one latte because of the water reservoir for steaming the milk. As in the reviews I read before purchase, the steam spout is short and low, but I can deal with that for the price."
4,great value,"As a beginner barista, having switched from paying for daily lattes at Starbucks, this machine has paid for itself in no time. We bought this machine after reading a lot of reviews...and we also liked the look of it compared to other models in its price range. Now that we've had it for a couple months, I can say that I do really like a lot of things about it. My only gripes: I am not a huge fan of the frothing wand, as it is hard to clean, and is an awkward height from the counter top, but it too works great. Overall, I would recommend this machine."
1,Leaks; cust. support non-responsive,"I have owned this unit for 5 months. After turning off the flow of espresso, the unit continues to leak, and will drip about 6 ounces of water (over night) into the drip pan.Customer support has been impossible to get through to. I have phoned, no humans to speak with. Left return call #, but no one called me. Emailed, again, no reply."
4,Great Espresso Machine for the Price..,"Owning this for the pas 2 months. Bought this in Amazon, arrived on time !Excellent machine for the price. Easy to clean and maintain, makes great espressos. I like the dark roasts, tried this machine with Illy Dark roast Coffee, turns out to be an awesome coffee...Only problem is the Milk Frother/Steamer, I don't use this feature very much so not bothered about it. The stem of the Steamer/Frother is not easily accessible by the frothing cup, and the stem is too short."
4,1 month with the DeLongi EC155,"Good value for the price, but you have to experiment to get that perfect espresso from this machine. Two areas to focus on are; 1) the grind (fine, but not too fine) and 2) the length of time you allow to ""pull"" the espresso. Found that no more than 22 seconds from the time the first drop hits the cup until you shut it off. Your mileage may vary.As others have stated the steamer wand is short, but with a small container it works very well."
1,Not enough pressure,"I tried it all, finer grinds, coarser grinds, packing lighter, cleaning etc.It still did not give a good clean push through both outlet holes. As I said before, when you see this many low ratings compared to 5, you better think twice. Nespresso here I come!"
4,I bough as a present - I think it did the job,I dont know - I bough as a present...I am not sure yo guys why you need 19 word in this review to require review....I just think I dont know
3,Sharron's critique!,"Not really what I was expecting. I do mochas every morning. All that would fit under the drip is a small cup or espresso cup. Didn't come with a small pot as you would expect, and I had to remove the metal tray it sits on to make my cup fit. I like the water compartment and the fact that you can make multiple cups at a time. Steamer is ok. Takes a little longer to heat up than my old coffee maker and it's kind of noisy, maybe because I removed the tray. It's just ok and I'm making it work."
3,"it's okay, but the price makes it better.","I have been using this machine for 11 months now. I bought it because of the price. Despite my enthusiasm for having an espresso machine, the DeLonghi EC155 is a bit of a disappointment. After 11 months of moderate use (8 espressos per week), the machine is now working improperly; fortunately, dealing with DeLonghi's customer service has not been a bad experience.The pros:-price-makes decent espresso/cappuccino in a reasonable amount of time-small sizeThe cons:-water leaks from milk frother whenever machine is on-the tamper is oddly located-made out of cheap plastic-water is constantly dripping when the machine is onDespite the cons, I liked the machine because of its price. I could have bought a much better espresso machine if I had spent a more money. In all, I would recommend this machine to someone on a budget. It is affordable, but it might be better to save some money (keep using that french press!) and get a better machine."
2,Lots of room for improvement.,This little machine does have it's advantages. Not having to fill it with water each time is a big one. It does look nice with the other black/silver appliances in my kitchen. Beyond that it has greatly disappointed me. When I read the review about it being short I didn't think it was THAT short. It is nearly impossible to steam enough milk for a small latte much less wanting a large one. Unless I want to go through the process 3 times. I currently do not own any espresso cups so I am using a short bowl to catch the shots. I have to hold it in place because the vibration of the machine shakes it right off. I'm thinking this will make a nice gift to someone who likes just straight espresso shots.
1,WORKS GREAT FOR ONLY A FEW MONTHS!,"I purchased this espresso maker for my husband's birthday and we were thrilled that it worked so well. That is for about four months. After the winter, we stored it away, when we took it out again and plugged it in, water was leaking out EVERY surface on the machine. I immediately contacted DeLonghi and they informed me that it had been just over a year since I had purchased the machine and there was nothing they could do. They recommended I take it to a DeLonghi service center and I explained that their website says there are none in my entire state. They sent back an email basically telling me tough cookies. So, here I am with an expensive espresso maker that was used less than 20 times and it doesn't work. Save your money, people! Find a brand that really stands behind their equipment. I wish people would write these reviews then update them a year or so later. I think that would affect the overall rating this machine received!"
2,Felix,"Coffee is pretty decent, but:1.When using 2 cups filter the coffee is dripping very slowly, can't go through the filter,using tamper makes it worse,2.The distance between the filter holder and cup tray is very short, even small cup hardly fits there, makes coffee machine usage very inconvenient. To make coffee I remove the coffee tray cover and put the cup on the bottom of the tray which is just ridiculous.3.If I knew about this before I wouldn't buy it."
4,Remember to get espresso cups!,"I love the small size of this machine, pretty space efficient for a small apartment like ours. What I have over looked is that small machine needs small cups to fit! Our mugs are all too big for the machine, and we have to settle with Japanese tea cups in the end. I will surely get fitting cups to complete the experience next time. Personally I find it a chore to clean up, which is the main reason for a 4 instead of 5. Maybe I will try espresso pods soon."
3,"makes good coffee, broke after a week","I bought the Delonghi EC155 due to the raves of a few friends and family members. It made great espresso, lots of crema, frothed the milk just fine, froth was thick and firm and lasted hours. Alas after only 2 weeks ,DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Makert he frother stopped working. Amazon makes it easy to return which I did and a replacement arrived immediately. Amazons service is fantastic!!I am having morning cappuccinno and very happy with it. Hope this machine lasts awhile. The people I know who also got this machine are also happy with the ease of use and coffee"
5,Love it!,"This machine makes fabulous espresso. It's easy to use, it doesn't burn the coffee and creates a great crema. I'm really glad I bought it. There are 2 small design flaws though: as other people have noted the steam wand is very close to the surface so would be hard to use. I only drink espresso, so this hasn't been an issue for me, but if you do want cappucinos, it may be. The other thing is that because you can change the coffee holder in the filter it can be hard to get the coffee out afterwards as the holder falls out even when you use the little plastic flap designed to hold it down. It's a minor annoyance that doesn't stop me giving this 5 stars as it makes fantastic coffee and that's what counts!"
4,Great purchase,"I did a lot of research on which small espresso maker to buy. At first I was really frustrated with the machine. The single espresso ground holder was getting gummed up and the crema was coming out too dark with such bitter espresso. So I switched espresso beans, ground my own, and used the double espresso holder. These changes made a world of difference. For the money, I think this is a wonderful machine. I make myself a latte every morning, and it's definitely paid for itself. I agree with other reviews that the steamer is oddly placed and low to the counter. I was struggling with that until I cleared a spot on the side of my counter so it leaves room to froth."
2,Great machine but 2 were cracked inside,"I purchased this for my parents as a gift. They loved it. However, they discovered that the inside of the compartment that holds the water tank was cracked. We returned it for an exchange, which Amazon was so good about, and the second one was cracked in the same place. Amazon suggested we return it for a refund, but I would still like to find another that is not damaged."
4,Terrific - it delivers!,"I ordered this after much research and have been delighted with it. It's simple enough to work and makes a terrific cup of espresso with a beautiful foam head. For 2 people, it's perfect. I would echo what many others have complained about: the length (or lack thereof) of the wand, which will require you to get a very small jug to foam your milk. Also, remember to ""bleed"" the wand before foaming the milk. But once I figured out the quirks of the machine, I've been having a fantastic cup every morning!"
2,Lowsy for making cappucino,"Making decent espresso but not dark enough. Easy to use. If you're buying this machine for making cappucino, find something else. It can't froth the milk properly. No forms!!"
4,making great espresso,"I love this machine, I used steamed expresso machine before this one and there is no comparison. it is the best buy with this kind price. the only thing that might be a problem for some people is that you have to get the right sized shot glass because it is a little bit short for a small mug. It is a great product."
3,"Great, but Doesn't Last","Bought it a year ago. The pump just faded out; intensely cleaned it a few times, but still takes 5 minutes to produce a shot.. Was great at the beginning. You get what you pay for, I guess.."
3,pretty good,"sorry that the water container is plastic! Also, there isn't room for a regular sized cup under the spicket...just a tiny espresso cup...makes good coffee, easy to operate...just started with it, so we'll see!"
3,not bad for the price,this is not a bad machine for the price. the foamer nozzle is kind of a pain to keep clean. it would be difficult if you wanted to serve a large group - but for one or two servings works well. the espresso could be a bit richer/stronger....still trying to fine tune that. in trying to make an americano it is a bit weak....but makes good cappucinos and lattes. the key is to definitely let it warm up as long as possible before making the shot.
4,Fine machine for the money,"I read a lot about this machine before I bought it so I was somewhat prepared for its shortcomings, but I have to say they didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected they would. The steam wand is a little close to the counter, but not to the point that I even notice it. It is a relatively small machine overall, but that is to be expected in this price range. I think for the price, it makes awesome coffee. I had a Starbucks machine that cost around $200 that never made coffee as well as this machine. The coffee itself has a great crema and the milk tastes like it has been frothed in a cafe. I am really happy with my purchase."
2,Not up to expectations,Let's start of with some good points. It can hold lots of water if you want to serve to many people and the temperature output of the drink is decent. The milk frothing is above average.Drawbacks of this purchase: 1) Only has enough room to get the espresso or coffee inside a small espresso cup. My old machine had enough space so that I could use a mug. 2) The largest drawback was that it did not make a strong cup of espresso compared to my last Melitta machine which was half the price.
2,Bad design,"The machine vibrates severely and makes loud noise during the coffee making process. The rubber feet do nothing to damp the vibration. If I don't hold the cup on the platform, the cup will drop to the ground. I've never seen such a poorly working coffee machine!It is almost unusable at home. I'll return the machine for refund."
4,DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker,I've used this machine daily for about a month. I like it better than my previous Krups machine. It froths milk much faster (about 30 seconds). You can add water at any time without worrying about the pressure in the water chamber. The drip tray can be removed for cleaning. I only wish the filter can hold more ground coffee to simultaneouly make for 3 or 4 espresso shots.
5,Nice machine,"I am not an espresso afficianado or anything but wanted to save the $4.00 each time I wanted a coffee. This machine is easy to put together, intuitive to use and really makes very good coffee. There is nothing confusing about this espresso maker and that is great for lay espresso folks such as myself. It seems really sturdy and will probably last a long time. Once the water heats up, it is pretty well insulated, as three hours later I went to make another one and had left it off. It took maybe three minutes and the machine was ready to go. Even the first time, the book told me to wait 10-15 minutes and it was actually ready in probably 7 minutes. It takes a little longer to warm the milk than I was expecting but made it nice and frothy with just enough foam to be dreamy."
5,"Good Value, Works Great",This is a nice little machine. When I lived in Europe I had a similar DeLonghi. No complaints at all.
2,coffee very weak,"I have been very disappointed in this machine. It seems well built enough, it does froth the milk quite well, but even the best roasted beans ground to perfection end up being a tasteless brew in this machine. The basket is smaller than expected so need to brew twice, but still the coffee is tasteless. It is very disappointing. I give a two star for the froth, but a zero for the taste of the coffee."
4,"Solid, easy to use","No complaints, haven't used the steamer yet since I bought it but it does the trick nicely for my two espressos in the morning."
4,Great Product,Everyone in my family has one of these. It is very reliable and easy to use. I would highly recommend it for the price.
1,Sent back twice.,"Would not pull shots. They just dripped out and burned each time. Tried Delonghi customer service, but to no avail."
3,Broken in 5 months,"This machine worked great. We did find ceratin milk produced better froth. After a few months there were some issues with the steamer producing a lot of dripping hot water. At 5 months of ownership, the machine will no longer pump water through the system, therefor no longer making any expresso. It was a good machine for the money while it worked but I expected it to last longer than 5 months."
4,Would buy again,My ONLY complaint about the EC155 is the sizing. The space between the drip output and the drip tray barley lets the shot glasses in. And the frothing nozzle is the same thing I have to lift the machine up to get my 12oz frothing pitcher out. and the way the nozzle is bent makes it hard to move the nozzle around while your frothing milk. these things wouldn't stop me from buying it again but made it a 4 star in my opinion. I'll try to get some 3d video next month with my Evo 3d when it comes out and will post it
2,DeLonghi,This was a replacement for my Krups XP4030 which stopped working. Disappointed in its performance. Creme was thin. Returned it. Went looking to buy another XP4030 and discovered they are not made any more and could not find any new ones. So I ended up buying a used one. It works as good as my old one. Delonghi EC155 had a lot of good ratings but could not stand up to the expectations that the XP4030 had set.
5,Wonderful espresso maker,"My parents bought me a cheap espresso maker in 1995 & it lasted me for about 8 years. I bought another cheap replacement with terrible results; it barely lasted 2 months. I was trying to decide between a Keurig & espresso maker and I chose the De'Longhi. I liked the versitility of an espresso/cappuccino maker & I also didn't care for the small quanity produced by the Keurig (I drink LARGE amounts of coffee). I've had this product for 6 months & I've used it nearly every day. It makes a great coffee/espresso, very flavorful. Be sure to purchase shot glasses or espresso cups as they do not come with the product."
3,Great except for the frothing wand,"I love this little machine for the price and for the amazing espresso it puts out. But right from the start, I worried about that dumb little frother. I used the machine 2 to 3 times per day for the last 6 weeks. One month ago, it was spraying steam and hot water out the top part of the plastic frothing unit. I clean it every time I use it and I'm diligent about running it to remove water from the line before steaming milk. But that problem got worse and one week ago, began spraying milk all over my kitchen. It was funny for the first 2.6 seconds, then it was just annoying and the problem would no go away after taking all steps to clean, tighten, loosen, etc. So, it's back to the store now and I'm looking for a better frothing system to match the decent espresso maker they've got here."
5,worth the money,"I did lots of research and bought this one. At this price range, I have no complaint. It does good job making good espresso and pretty quickly actually."
1,Disappointed,"Only after three uses, the bottom plastic part broke! The material is very cheap. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying this machine. I immediately returned."
5,Excellent little machine,"This is a wonderful little machine. I've used it every day for the past six months and have found it to be reliable, easy to use, and easy to clean -- and very able to make both a perfect shot and perfectly steamed milk. We have a lot of great cafes in our neighborhood, but the absolutely best lattes are happening right here in our kitchen!We buy high-quality, organic espresso beans and use a Capresso burr grinder and the beautiful Bodum shot glasses. We also have a 20-ounce Krups frothing pitcher and the Taylor thermometer, which are perfect accessories.This is a great machine, and the value cannot be beat."
4,Nice espresso machine for a very fair price,"I'm very happy with the Espresso maker, though as I read in one review the plastic tamper is completely useless."
2,Destined for Landfill,"I purchased this Delonghi EC155 espresso machine over 1 year ago. It has died. I have cleaned it w/vinegar, but the pump is just no longer working. Ug. Although the price is right, I will look into purchasing a different replacement machine, given the environmental impact of inevitable annual trips to the dump."
1,Milk Frother is Terrible,"They should call the milk frother a milk vibrator because it didn't actually froth milk. The frother was terrible to begin with, but after about a week it just stopped working altogether. Luckily, I did not want it for the cappuccino so I did not bother to return it. If you want an espresso machine... this one is good for the money. If you want it to do more than that, get something else."
2,Great until it fails...,"I bought this about 10 months ago, and used it daily. It has now failed, unable to deliver water, the same problem as many others have reported. I have maintained it as instructed, cleaning out with vinegar every 2 months or so. This is an unacceptable life for any kind of commercial product. I liked the great espresso, with good crema. It easily makes frothed milk, and the steamer is very easy to clean (just wipe it and let steam for half a second). It has height limitations for cups but espresso cups and shorter cups all fit fine. If you can accept that this thing will last about year, go ahead. If not take my advice, don't buy one. Build quality has to be suspect (cheap materials in the pump construction?)."
2,Poor quality parts and assembly,"Though designed in Italy, this is made in China, and it shows. The machine makes decent espresso, but you have to be very careful with the parts. The motor shakes the whole machine, so the cups shake out of position on the stand. Connecting the handle/holder to the machine requires a bit of force--while holding the machine steady. Then there's the plastic water tank. It got knocked off the counter accidentally and cracked. I tried to order a replacement from DeLonghi online, but their site doesn't have a traditionally secure payment page, so that's the last straw."
3,Good value,"Heats quickly and makes great crema. The steamer nozzle is a bit tricky because it's so close to the counter - not a lot of room to move the pitcher around. Also, I can't figure out how to get the steamer nozzle off for cleaning. But for the price, I'm glad I bought this."
3,Too New to Rate; Parts Missing??,"I was just given a new ec155 for Christmas. The box did not contain a user's manual or a coffee measuring spoon. Did each of yours come with these two items? If so, what would you make of their absence from the box of a ""new"" unit? Thanks."
4,Delonghi EC155 Espresso maker,"I am a novice espresso maker so I watched videos on how to make good espresso on u-tube....then it took about 2-3 tries to get my latte just right. The tamper is a pain, but the rest works great. It would have helped to have a bit more instructions with the unit....key is that it does not shut off so figuring things out takes practice and patience. The small space below where the espresso is delivered is a pain, but I bought espresso cups and they work fine."
3,Disappointed with design,"After reading countless reviews, I thought this would be the espresso maker for me. Sadly, even after removing the drip tray, there just wasn't enough room for a normal sized (or smaller) coffee cup. There wasn't much room under the steam wand, but I probably could've lived with it. I wasn't impressed with the button in the middle of the cup warmer on top either. For a less expensive machine, the quality wasn't bad. But, I just couldn't live with a few of its faults. I returned it."
2,2nd one died too,"We bought this espresso maker based on the great reviews it got in several places. The first one died after 9 months - the pump stopped working. After some more searching we decided to risk buying the DeLonghi again because it made great espresso for the price. Now after 3 months this second unit has also died. The heating unit failed. Fortunately, I saved all the packing, etc. this time so I hope to get a replacement or refund.Bottom line: great espresso, poor longevity. If you buy this machine save all the packaging so you can return it if needed. It has a one year warranty.BTW I don't think we did anything to cause the failure. We read the manual and used it as directed. If we did cause both problems then the machine is too fragile for use in a normal household."
4,Better than the more expensive Krups machine I replaced,"Very nice very simple espresso machine. Produces good foam and crema, and I use it on a daily basis for over a year. Only problem I have ran into is it does not work well with very fine grounds. Couldn't be happier otherwise with the price and performance."
3,"good machine, not superb","i used it for like 8 months now, then it became too much work for every day cappuccino, so i stopped using it..most of the time it works good, but sometimes the espresso comes without the crema, and the milk doesn't get frothed right.. but for the price, don't complain. it had also a $20 rebate when i bought it.."
5,Very cool,"I absolutely love this product. It is the first time that I have ever made cappuccino and it took me a little while to master, but in the end I am very pleased. I use this now every day and love it so much better than regular coffee. Thank you."
1,Be preparded to spend more to get a good cappuccino maker,"Cappuccino remained tasteless, even after 20 uses. Very disappointing; happy can return to Amazon without paying shipping. I realize,as I love cappuccino, I will have to spend more to get a very good machine which can produce a very good cappuccino. Back to the research. Save your money and the disappoint of what this machine produces and having to return it."
4,Amazing for the price,"Great creama for $80!!!!I'm very impressed.Only complaint: Amazon says this machine is made in Italy....it's made in China, designed in Italy."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this espresso machine based on the other reviews. It worked for two months and then the coffee started coming out very slow and does not have the creamy look but just watery like the regular coffee, finally, it is just dripping and takes forever to make a cup. It was such a hassel to send to their service center to have it fixed. It took literally a whole month to get it back from the service center, and it still does not work. I am calling Delonghni now to see if there are other options."
3,Meh,"You get what you pay for. If you want a real espresso machine that makes real espresso, you don't want this DeLonghi. But I bought it for an office, and I'm using pods in it (because of the mess factor); for this use, it's ok. The water temp seems about right, but the pump has barely enough power to get the water through the pod. It's more like ""quick drip"" than true espresso.The good: it was cheap, it's relatively quiet, it has a small footprint, and it makes hot coffee.The not-so-good: it appears to be underpowered and it doesn't really make espresso."
4,"Great quality for the price, some learning curve required","This was a great ""beginner"" espresso machine for my family. It is messy if you don't use it right, so you have to learn, for instance, that it ""likes"" a fine grind and will leak if you try to pack a courser grind. The steamer nozzle also is set a bit low, so you have to either elevate the unit or use a smaller steamer container than you might otherwise want to use, otherwise you will be tilting the container a lot and making a mess. It does not have a separate steam chamber, so you do have to wait for it heat from ""brew"" to ""steam"" levels, but it doesn't take long. But once you figure out the idiosyncracies, it works like a charm."
3,Does a good job but leaks.,"We have had this just under a couple of years. We use it all the time! It does a great job but has a tendency to leak from both the frother nozzle and the coffee drip. Seems to have gotten worse over time. Might have to replace it soon. It's too biggest issues is leaking and maybe durability. So if you use it a lot and want it to last more than a couple of years, might want to keep looking. Otherwise it's great for the price."
4,Like it but...,"I think for the price it's a good machine for home use. HOWEVER, it vibrates something terrible! It sounds like a tool grinder that you would have in your garage. It vibrates so much, you have to stand there holding the cup underneath it to keep it from vibrating off the stand."
4,great value for price,Unless you are willing to spend $300 I don't think you will find a better machine than this one. You do have to warm up the machine for at least 15-30 minutes before using. A little difficult/confusing to warm it down after using the steamer.....
3,Coffee maker clogs up,Been great for a few months now its clogged up and running vinegar or water through it doesn't make any difference.Needs a better way of getting into the tap area where the coffee comes out.
2,WAS NOT ABLE TO EVEN PUT BASKET IN PROPERLY,"I TRIED TO USE IT , I DID NOT WANT TO RETURN IT. BUT I HAVE RA AND I COULD NOT BUT THE BASKET ON IT. PLUS WAITING 20 MINUTES FOR THE WATER TO HEAT WAS RIDICULOUS., I WANTED TO GET THIS COFFEE POT BECAUSE I LOVE ESPRESSO AND I WANTED A SPECIAL COFFEE MAKER.. SORRY IT DIDNT WORK FOR ME"
4,Excellent espresso maker for the money!,"I have owned three of these espresso makers. If you use it 2-3 times daily, it will last 1-2 years before it breaks, which is why I give it 4 stars, but is not a problem for me given the price of this product. I never use the milk wand, as I primarily drink straight espresso, americanos (I heat water in microwave), or ice coffees. The espresso is very rich and tastes comparable to more expensive espresso makers. When making a shot you almost always develop the three layers. The filter will clog eventually as indicated by a slower draw. Use a safety pin or the like to clear each tiny hole in the filter. Enjoy your espresso!"
4,I bought 2nd machine,I'm using my second EC155. The first one lasted 2 years. I can't go back to coffee maker. Because it delivers such a fine espresso I don't mind taking extra labor. I did look at more expensive machines after the first one died but it's hard to beat the value of EC155 for the money.
4,Pretty awesome,"This little thing is great. It makes little bit of espresso foam, steams milk, heats water to right temperature, easy to be cleaned. Couldn't ask for more at this price point. Great for small apartments."
1,"Does not work, returning",Total bummer that this item doesn't even work! We tried so many times and this just plain doesn't brew properly.
4,As Good or Better Than More Expensive Machines,"I've had this machine for several years now and it is still making very decent espresso. I don't make many capuccinos, but when I do it works well. I have taken this machine to work and purchased a (considerably more expensive) Gaggia for the house, and the Gaggia has been something of a disappointment after a year - it started well but now takes much too long to make a double. The DeLonghi hasn't lost a step in the same period and is an older machine."
3,Works well but has one (for me) critical design flaw,"Took a while to get the machine to work, but once it did it seems to work okay.Big problem for me is they designed the machine without enough clearance to be able to actually use a coffee cup, even a small one.What we're they thinking?So, if you're only going to make espresso in one of those tiny little toy cups you will be fine.If you want to use it to make anything else then I suggest the similar Hamilton Beach product for half the price."
3,Pretty good for the money,"Pros: Cheap, easy, compactCons: Low powerThus keep in mind- Dont try and heat the milk using steamer. Just foam using steamer.- Too fine a powder => better packing => More required pressure => Large coffee shot pull time => More bitter coffee"
5,works as promised,"Classic espresso machine, 15 Bar pressure. Works great so far, like our old $300 Gaggia espresso machine we had when we lived in Europe. Beautiful crema. Have not tried milk steamer. Needs a short espresso cup to receive the coffee. Handle has rubber gasket which seems to tighten firmly."
1,Really liked this machine...when it worked,"Received this item as a Christmas gift and by Jan 10th it wasn't working properly (no pump pressure). After troubleshooting with a Delonghi rep, to no avail, I had to send the unit back (2 inches of the cord). They told me to expect a turnaround of about 5-10 days. After two weeks of waiting, I'm told there's a back order of 3-5 additional weeks, which puts me out of the amazon return period. I should have just dealt with amazon directly and exchanged the unit for a Mr.Coffee or a Breville. Lesson learned.Pros:-Great tasting espresso when it works-Great latte's when it worksCons:-No pump pressure after 2 weeks of use (cleaned it, primed it, purged it, tried different tamping pressures, etc)-Durability-Customer service"
3,Good while it lasted,"I bought the De'Longhi from Amazon in October 2010, a year and three months ago. It made great espresso during that time, but yesterday I noticed the green light came on as soon as I turned it on. The heating element seems to have died three months after the warranty expired. This machine was used in a household with only one coffee drinker who made one double-espresso a day for a bit over a year. Not nearly good enough for more than three stars."
1,Wouldn't produce decent espresso no matter what I tried...,"After much research, I ordered this because of all of the great reviews I've read here and elsewhere...didn't work for me. I tried 3 different espressos from 3 different sources--all ground for espresso--one even ground extra fine and the espresso pulled came out weak every time, with just a little crema. I don't know if I got a jinxed machine or what, but it just wouldn't work. And Amazon just keeps raising the price on the little wonder. It's gone from $79.99 to over 100.00 over the past month alone. I sent mine back for a refund. I might try one from a department store to see if the problem was just the one I got from Amazon."
5,The Real Deal,"This thing works as advertised, as I've read with others, the built-in tamper isn't very good-- but besides that... this thing is full featured and gets the job done flawlessly. I've been enjoying espresso practically every morning since the day after I got it! I highly recommend this fine piece of machinery to everyone looking for an espresso machine."
4,Does the job and wasn't expensive,"It works nicely, both with loose coffee and the ESE pods, and was very affordably priced. There were some minor drawbacks, using the built-in tamper is rather difficult due the lightness of the machine, and it can vibrate disturbingly (probably once again due to the lightness of the machine.)However, I use mine all the time and couldn't be happier."
5,Great Little Machine.. You won't be sorry!!,"After a lot of research on which Espresso machine to buy, I came up with the DeLonghi EC702 being a great machine at a great price, but could not find it in stock anywhere, including DeLonghi's website.So I went with the smaller EC155, and I couldn't be happier it's a great espresso machine and so far every cup gets better and better.I followed the directions and other comments about running several cups of hot water through the machine before my first real cup of espresso, so the first cup I made tasted great and had beautiful crema on top. You can't go wrong with this machine.Pros:- Great price- Great performance so far- Heats up quickly- nice size water chamberCons:- It's size, the steam wand is low and a bit tricky- it is a bit loud, but maybe they all are (my first machine)"
1,Died after 2 months,This machine made very good espresso and steamed milk - until it died after 2 months of gentle use. Don't buy this product unless you are looking for an expensive doorstop.
4,Pretty standard espresso machine,"I think this machine works well, but is a bit overpriced. The only thing that really bothers me about this model is that it shakes when it's making espresso, causing my espresso cup to dance all over the stand! I have to hold it in place when the liquid comes out. The machine does look very sleek though."
4,great,i use this daily and have no issues with it. if you keep it clean you can get many years of use out of this unit. good product thanks.
3,I found a 3 cm scar on the surface,The machine is OK.I just made a espresso with the StarBucks Dark espresso roast. But it didn`t as bitter as I think.Then I find a 3 cm scar on the surface in the left side of the maker. Very disappoint. Ask for a compensating
4,"Poor build quality, but gets the job done!","Ok, as a avid espresso fan, I was very eager to get an espresso machine that fits my budget.While it produces good espresso, you definitely gets what you paid for: flimsy handle that does not fit perfectly, cheap plastic body, a steamer that doesn't really work.Again, the espresso does come out. But I would not bet that this product can last."
2,my month's experience,"I don't particularly like the machine. It's not a month old and I can see it is not likely to last very long :(The way it heats up is already inconsistent, and one of the filters lets the espresso come through, but for some reason after the 5th or 6th use, it no longer produces the creama. I've done all I can to insure it's perfectly clean but still it's worthless to me ."
1,Don't buy it,This is probably one of the worst things I've ever purchased. The filter didn't fit and the machine almost vibrated off the counter when I turned it on. It never produced one drop of coffee and had to be returned. DON'T BUY IT!! It's not worth the headache of having to return it. I won't purchase another product from De'Longhi.
4,"Good, reliable machine","I would definitely reccomend this machine to people who pull their own esspresso shots. If you know how to grind the coffee and how to pull the shot properly, this machine performs very well for the money. It is an affordable price for the 15 BARs of pressure and pretty good quality. I feel that my husband and I are able to pull shots that are comparable to local coffee shops on this home machine. De'Longhi is a great brand and we also own two space heaters by this brand and are happy with their products."
4,Great inexpensive espresso maker,Read all the reviews before purchasing this unit. For the price it makes great espresso with the crema and all. I did buy the tamper as some suggested as the built in one does not work well. The frother works great also making thick hot cream for capucchinos. It did not take long to learn how to work it. I do think it is important to preheat at least 15 minutes.
1,Broke just one year after purchase,"I liked it because it was ""DeLonghi"" and was cheap compared to other pump espresso makers. It broke just one year after I purchased it. The key take-away here is ""you get what you pay for""."
5,Repeat DeLonghi purchase,"Baristas expect espresso ""cream"" with top rated machines, and you get it with DeLonghi! This is our second DeLonghi machine. (The first one worked for about 5 years or more.) We're very satisfied, you won't be disappointed."
2,Not Good coffee,"I am not particularly happy with this product. The espresso ""discharged"" by this machine is not watery and has no strength what-so-ever. I have experimented enough with different amounts of coffee and water but looks like light espresso is the best this machine can do. The krupps espresso machine I had earlier was much better.."
1,why bother ?,"impatiently waiting 30 + minutes to get the dark fluid out is so annoying that i'll be sending mine back. the process to get a second cup is messy, then the coffee is nothing special, and the steam wand ejects more water than air. how can so many reviewers be so off the mark?"
1,Worst customer experience EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,The machine is great when it works but Delonghi has the worst customer service EVER!!!!!!!!!!! Our machine broke after 3 months and then told us they would replace once we cut the cord and sent it in. 3 months later and they still have not sent us a new one and every time we call they have a different story. If you buy a machine just hope it works properly so you dont have to deal with them
2,Very dissapointed,"After using the Krups Bravo type 871 for ten years we decided to get a new espresso machine for a change. We order the De'Longhi EC155 because of the great reviews it had at Amazon. We made a BIG mistake. After two days of using it we're going back to our old Krups machine. The De'Longhi does not make espresso. It's lazy, the parts don't fit right and the coffee is extremely mild for my taste."
2,"good while it lasted, warranty replacement slow","The unit made decent espresso while it worked. It broke down within 4 months, warranty service is very slow.Time to replace unit after it failed (from first contact to actually receiving replacement unit): 46 daysUnit does make good espresso, and the replacement unit does froth milk much better than the original.Decent for the price, but not sure about dependability... especially when you have to wait over a month when one fails."
3,Great machine but poor customer service,"Actually I had it for more than 4 month and I still love it so much.I drink coffee for years and use lots of way to make coffee.But this is my first time to buy a espresso.I have to say ""This is really easy and make great quality""First I use my coffee bean which is blend for moka.The coffee taste different then I cook it on stove.Always has a nice Crema. (Of course also depend on coffee beans)The only complain is that u can't use a mug cuz it is to short for it.and the steam pipe is also to low.When I buy it, it has a mail in rebate for 20 dollars.I fill out all they need and make a copy for the bar code.Because I can't tear the bar code down and think it is stupid to mail back the whole box.2 month later, they ask me to provide a bar code which is on the box.I tell them the situation and provide the bar code copy with the order number from amazon.No thing has get back to me so far.I guess they just give me hard time to get my 20 dollars."
1,2 Now and both defective,DO NOT BUY this DeLonghi EC155I have gotten 2 now and BOTH did not work.What a bunch of crap...make that 3 now that DO NOT WORK ... DEAD On ARRIVALTAKE THIS PIECE of Crap off your website Amazon
5,Excellent Machine!,"We purchased this machine 6 months ago. I wanted to wait to write the review to see how it is still doing at 6 months; we are still in love with this machine!! It makes EXCELLENT espresso! I was a long time Starbucks fan, but since owning this machine, I definitely prefer our homemade espresso lattes over Starbucks. We have not experienced any problems and feel that we received a great value for the money."
1,Weak espresso !,"If you know what a good espresso is and need a deep, rich, and strong caramel-cherry deliciousness double shot that makes you happy for half a day then this machine is NOT for you!Yes the creme is there but that's it. And now I can't return my machine because it's used:( I have returned to my $10.00 thrift store espresso maker that my mom picked up for me. Thanks again mom!!Laura B.BostonDe'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker"
3,Decent machine,"(NOTE: I have only used the machine a couple times to date.)Not sure I would have paid full price (i bought it when it was on sale and DeLonghi was doing a rebate).The milk frother is frustratingly close to the machine. (maybe consider buying a separate one?)The tamper is plastic and attached to the machine. So, bought a separate one for a few dollars on amazon."
2,Good Espresso but short life,"Initially I was very excited to use this machine. It made decent espresso with ease and despite the short stem, the steamer made good foamy froth. But in less than 4 months, the machine stopped working. I guess it has to do with the lack of a self cleaning system but after trying out every cleaning tip suggested on this review/board, the machine is still not working. It makes hopt water but doesn't generate sufficient pressure to extract coffee.We are past our return window.... What a waste of money!!! stay away from this machine. It is cheap for a reason."
2,"Delonghi EC155. It's real espresso, Just not good espresso.","I bought the EC155 machine to make espresso shots, not any milk based drinks. Unfortunately this machinemakes espresso that is a little watery, lacking complex flavor notes, and a little bitter.I tried all different grinds (I have a Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder), different tamping forces.I also removed the valve in the portafilter, turning it into an unpressurized portafilter.That didn't help. It does produce great crema, so it looks like top notch espresso, but it doesn't taste like it. I believe that all good espresso has crema, but not all espresso with crema is good.All I want is a shot as good as Starbucks, or Panera Bread etc.If anyone knows how to make this machine produce such a shot, let me know how. If not, how high end of a machine do I need to produce such a shot? Gaggia Classic for $400? Rancilio Silvia $650? Higher end?"
1,Worked...for about a year,Bought this unit because of the reviews and because I love to drink cappuccinos on the weekend. Unit worked great for a year...now the pressure isn't strong enough to push the water through. I've DE-calcified the unit three different times and there still isn't enough pressure. I really don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews...my guess is the reviews weren't updated after the first year. You get what you pay for.
4,Works like a charm,"Works. Don't really use the steamer since easier just to microwave the milk; however, it's worked to spec and relatively easy to work."
5,My girlfriend loves it!,"This is my first Espresso machine, and it works great. Its very easy to use. I use it everyday for 4 months now with no problems. I recommend it for anyone who loves coffee."
1,Worked great for a year then stopped working,"I hadn't bothered to check other reviews until today. My machineworked beautifully for about a year and then the problems began.Drip too slow, coffee tastes subpar, etc. I tried cleaning andall the other ""remedies"" suggested in the manual, but nothinghelped. Going to try another espresso maker. I guess you getwhat you pay for."
2,Good idea but does not work with ESE pods,"I purchased it with hopes that it would make great espressos with the Illy espresso pods at a great price. Unfortunately, it did not work. It may be a good option if you want to grind your own beans. The issue is 1. you really need to preheat the espressomaker for 30 minutes. 2. The podholder leaks the water when you insert the pod so the espresso is watery.I tried it for 3 weeks and it did not work no matter how much I tightened the podholder. Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy for defective items and I was able to return it. It seems like others who purchased this item had similar problems. It costs more however, I plan to try the Nespresso Citiz next. It's on my wishlist."
5,First Time Espresso user ... Love it,"It was as promised ... still learning how to use it properly, but loving it so far!"
4,Good basic machine,"I have been using home Espresso machines for 5 years now. I bought the DeLonghi EC155 to replace the 5-6 year old machine I had that reached ""maturity"". The EC155 is a basic machine, a good value for $100. The only complaint I have is that the water tank is too small, so it requires frequent fill ups."
3,is okay,"for the price I paid, I was disappointed in the expresso maker. After only 1 month the green 'ready' light went out. Also the distance between where the coffee drips and the base of the machine is very very short. An espresso cup hardly fits. I have had DeLonghi in the past and had great machines, but this one is not up to DeLonghi quality."
5,Excellent little machine..,"I really liked this espresso maker and milk frother. It's pump driven so it doesn't take any effort to make perfect milk foam for your capuccino, and it's fast and easy to clean. We figure after three weeks of use it's paid for itself...."
5,Saving me plenty at Starbucks!,"I bought this on sale for $99 and LOVE IT! I read mixed reviews but I have been very happy. I love a latte each morning and can't afford daily Starbucks trips. It is easy to brew a double espresso, a breeze to steam a little low fat milk and presto, my morning latte! Easy to clean. Even the cheesy plastic stamper works in a pinch. I think the key is to let it get hot enough, have the right grind of coffee, and always clean the machine immediately. I have had it for a couple weeks and make myself a latte every morning and an occasional afternoon. I can't say enough about how wonderful this little guy is!"
1,Wanted to like it so bad,"I wanted to like it so bad. It got great reviews. the ergonomics of the whole layout is terrible.it leaks. everytime I use it, it makes me mad and felt like i wasted 100 bucks"
2,Not what I expected,"I think I'm being too critical and I may change my rating to more stars in the future, however this is an average espresso machine in my opinion. It replaces my old Cusinart espresso machine that was sooo much easier to use. And the coffee was just as good. With this one, just reading the manual is a 4 credit course! Aside from the complexity, I also can't fully tighten the handle. It will only close about 3/4 of the way, so there's not enough space for 2 cups."
5,Use it for 3 years now and still works great,"I got it for $74 when it's on sale on Amazon. If you are a regular coffee drinker or Starbucks visitor. Get one and the value and the quality is so much better than visiting Starbucks. Assume $5 a starbucks cappuccino, after 30 cups you make it so worth."
4,"Overall, a great machine","Over all, the Espresso machine works well and is easy to use. The frothing wand is very short, but You can still make it work. The espresso filter and holder are junk. If you are using ground, loose espresso, (not pods) it is near impossible to empty the used espresso into the garbage, with out the filter coming loose and falling into the garbage with the espresso. There is no way to secure the filter. It lays very loose in the holder. Other then that, the machine works great and makes excellent tasting espresso shots. No different then your average coffee shop. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a great machine at a bargain price."
3,Good for one year and then pump pressure falls low,"I got this machine and the De'Longhi BAR32 Retro, one for the office and one for at home. Both were working great for one year, and then the pump lost the ability to generate sufficient pressure, so that now the coffee drips quite slowly, rather than flows from the dispenser. Lime residue (calcium carbonate) is not an issue, as we live in an area with soft water, and as I descaled the machines regularly. I also use the same ground coffee in these machines as when I bought them, so a coffee that is ground too fine is not an issue either. If you want something that lasts, don't buy these."
4,Good coffee maker,"Good choice for a real home-made espresso ""a la Italiana... or a la Europea""...;-)Being eclectic is to select and use what I consider the best elements of a system. And this coffee maker, along with a grinder and a good coffee, was my selection."
3,it is ok,not to bad i expected more out of it takes awhile to heat the milk and steam does not always come out a small stream of water but its just ok
5,The little engine that could,"This little guy makes a legitimate espresso with crema and produces frothy milk with only a little practice. For the money that achievement is amazing. I've only had it a couple weeks so I have no idea how (or if) it will hold up over time. But at this point, it's a winner! (Not a bad idea to pop for the stand alone tamper and the milk pitcher, which is the perfect size given the wand doesn't give you much room.)"
5,Awesome,"I bought one for a Christmas present, and loved it so much that I bought my own! Very easy to use."
4,"happy with it, but buy a handheld tamper","the built-in tamper is just silly. I paid somewhere near $100 for this thing. it wasn't until I got a $7 tamper to go with it that the espresso it produced started tasting like actual espresso.that being said, this is a very convenient machine, works like a charm so far, and once you have a tamper for it, the espresso's great."
1,Arrived missing parts!,"How disappointing it was to receive this highly rated and researched machine only to find that the plug, spring, and other vital parts for the water reservoir were missing! There wasn't even a parts list so we didn't know what we were missing until we went online to look it up. Rather than try another we chose to return this for a refund. I have no faith that another would be shipped to us with all necessary pieces or, that it would stand up to daily use seeing what kind of sloppy work they seem to do."
2,"Great for 18 months, now leaks badly","This was a great product for about 18 months, then it started leaking - badly. It is not possible to get inside of the machine to figure out what seals are gone, or where the leak is, so the solution is lots of towels. Probably would cost more to repair than replace."
5,Great value for the price!,"I ordered this espresso machine after my Krups machine died. I had another machine in mind, but it was $800 and a bit out of what we could spend at the time. After reading the reviews of this machine, I decided it was worth a try, it was rated better than the Krups machine we made work for us for 3 years, so it couldn't be a total waste. I was very pleased once I started using it.It is a very short machine, so only small shot glasses or something of similar height can fit under to catch the espresso, but so far that is the only drawback I have run into. It heats milk quickly, it warms up much more quickly than the directions say as well. The espresso tastes pretty decent as well :)I am sure this machine isn't perfection, but for the price it is an awesome deal!!"
1,I hate this thing!,"I got this espresso maker in December 2009. By April 2010 it was leaking out of the where the steamer wand enters the machine. I could deal with that, but now it's started to pour water out of the steamer wand whenver I attempt to make a shot of espresso. I would think it would last longer than eight months! What a total piece of junk. I'm going to buy a Saeco and toss this DeLonghi in the trash."
1,De'Longhi EC155 Pump Espresso Maker,This coffee maker was noisy and didn't make coffee. I have had several pump machines and De'Longhi was the worst. I returned this piece of crap and will never purchase a De'Longhi product again. I would have given this Zero Stars but this review Forces you to rate this crap.
1,Misleading information,Country of manufacture: ItalyThat is a lie;the product is manufactured in China.I returned the product but considering the cost oftransport is uneconomical to do so. I just feel cheated.Moral: be wary of the origin of the products advertised.
1,Terrible product,"This product was a waste of money. I guess you do have to spend several hundred dollars at least to get a decent machine. My main problem is the espresso function - it takes about 20 minutes to make one espresso. Turn it on, and out of the filter it comes, drip by drip, for ages. Seriously, a water droplet at a time, for almost 20 minutes. By the time you have enough coffee, it's luke warm, and you have to mix it with foamed milk if you want it hot. If you just want espresso, it's cold - what kind of an ""espresso machine"" is that?I am going to throw this in the trash and bite the bullet and probably spend $400 on something that can make an espresso in a more reasonable amount of time.I suggest you do the same unless you want to find out for yourself."
4,Great Little Expresso Machine,"I bought this machine so that I could make real expresso with crema. I have discovered that it needs time to process the expresso, so it has become a weekend machine, when I have the time and patience.I have been using the Krups, Type 963 for many years and still use it for a strong cup of coffee. The Krups gives me instant gratification since it makes 4 oz. in about 3- minutes. The DeLonghi makes me wait for an oz. of its delicious brew. First the water has to warm up before turning on the pump (I have found that 15-minutes is plenty of time for this warm up), then pump the water. It is a pleasure to see the dark liquid come out and to smell the rich aromatic aromas. I have not used the steamer since I do not use it for steaming milk. The resulting expresso is worth waitng for and now I associate the making and experience the sipping as part of my downtime.The price for this machine was unbeliveably low from Amazon and on top had a $20 manufacturer's rebate. Thank you."
5,Great!,"Espresso machine works great!!!! Easy to clean, easy to use... It is small enough to fit any kitchen counter if you have a small kitchen. I would recommend this item to my coffee drinker friends in a blink."
4,A true money saver!,"This little machine packs a punch! It's noisier than I would prefer, and the pump priming can get a bit fussy if you don't give it ample time to heat up (give it about 30 seconds longer than when the green ""ok"" light comes on), but it has performed consistently. One down side is that you have to stand there the whole time and manually shut the machine off at the end of the pull and you have to measure out the water if you don't want overflows or diluted shots, but that's a small price to pay for the quality."
1,Leaks water after one week,I bought this because of the decent reviews....WOW I was fooled. The espresso is weak and after one week the machine is leaking water. It's junk!
3,No Auto Shut-Off!,"Did a lot of research prior to purchasing this unit; generally speaking it makes good espresso, but it is very frustrating not to have an auto shut off - we have to sit and watch it or it will keep on brewing and you will either have a mess on your hands or some very weak coffee. It is finicky - it stopped working after a few months so we did a thorough cleaning - when reassembling the filter cap, be sure to screw on with sufficient tension or the filter will not work."
3,"Perfect espresso, wishing for a better steamer/foamer attachment","The espresso lives up to the wonderful reviews I read before purchasing this espresso maker. In fact, it makes better espresso than my Breville did! Howevere, the milk steamer setting is very loud compared to my Breville. I do wish I could get my milk to foam...this steam wand and the funny little attachment at the end just doesn't do it. I don't see in the mini catalog that came with my unit that there is a replacement want available, but would love to find one if there is!! All in all, a great little machine!"
4,Damn good espresso,Damn good espresso. I have not tried to make a latte so I can't comment on that part of it. It does not come with a cup to make the latte though so you'll need to order one if you plan using it for that. They are around $13-$20 on amazon.
2,Difficult to use,"It made a great cup of coffee for about a month but has a lot of problems now. It water starts dripping as soon as the machine is turns on for warming up, before the dial is on brew. The handle needs increasingly more push to the right to get in place. It doesn't stop brewing when it's brewed a cup. The steamer starts by spewing water before steam, watering the drink. The steamer is difficult to clean. The filter holder in the machine is impossible to screw lose and clean, like the manual instructs. I gradually went back to my stove top espresso maker. I wish I had bought a Keurig instead"
2,Great at first - Pooped out Quickly,"I purchased this product a little more than a year ago. At first, it seemed a great upgrade to the Mr. Coffee espresso maker I had, which never really produced crema. The Delonghi was hot enough, had plenty of pressure, and created a beautiful crema. However, within 6 months, the performance of this machine went from a perfect stream of espresso, to coming out in drips. I cleaned everything meticulously. I sought support from Delonghi, primed the pump as instructed, etc. No improvement in pressure, so they determined the pump went bad. They replaced the unit, and I was up and running again. Almost. This replacement, which I believe was used/reconditioned, never had the performance of the original one when it was new, and now we're at a dribble again. My $20 Mr. Coffee lasted 3 times as long as this $80 Delonghi. Very disappointed."
4,Good espresso maker,"Easy but a little tedious to use. When I use two cups, I believe that the left cup for some reason, makes a weaker espresso. The coffee flavor is rich and aromatic. The milk steamer works very good. For paying under a $100, this is a great buy."
3,Works great,"We've owned this machine for over a year, and it still works ok. Within the first couple weeks we thought the steamer broke (it wouldn't function at all), but it turned out we weren't cleaning it properly and it was clogged. (Gross, I know). The espresso doesn't seem to drip as quickly as when it was first purchased, and we can't seem to find the cause."
5,Very good for the price,"I just use espresso coffee ground fine, and I love the thick, foamy espresso it makes. I don't use the frother--just put regular milk in, so can't comment on that."
2,Ok to start with...,We have had 3 of these machines. The first one was wonderful and lasted for over a year. The second one was OK however played out after less than a year. Got the 3rd one and not even 3 months later the pump is going. Soooo on to the Nespesso which is a bit more pricey however the reviews are excellent and to be honest with you we are done with this brand. I feel we gave it ample chances and are moving on.
2,Did Get everything,"I put this espresso Machine on my wedding registry. And So I got it as a gift and it didn't come with the Filter holder,frother,or measuring spoon.."
2,disappointing espresso machine,"this machine did not deliver quality espresso. I tried different coffees and all the tips included. weak, coffee with no crema.. the steamer worked adequately but a Mr coffee espresso macine is better.. sadly returning"
3,"worked well, for awhile","We really liked this machine for a couple of months, then all of a sudden we could not get 2 shots at a time and were limited to using the one shot holder. Now, after 10 months it sounds like the motor is giving out. We have used espresso machine cleaner regularly and read the manual and can not find a solution to these problems. Have never been able to actually tamp the grounds and get the water through. Always had to have them in there very loosely or pump would not force water through. Overall, hard to decide if it was worth the money. Great price, but definitely didn't last long. Looking for a better machine now to replace it."
2,Worked decent for just a year ...,"and then stopped producing enough pressure to make espresso. Contacted customer support a few day after the end of the warranty period and was summarily dismissed with the following responseDear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting us regarding the concerns you are having with your Delonghi product.

3,Espresso machine,To noisy and steamer does not work.I plan on returning asap.Hopefully new machine will work correctly.If new machine works correctly it will be good value .If not I will return for credit.
5,Excellent quality,"I did not expect this good a product for the price. The espressos and cappucinos I make with this machine are as good as those I get at good restaurants. I bought a metal tamper to use with it. For a frothing cup I suggest using a thick walled cup as I found the stainless steel cups were too tall. To clean the forther I just fill a cup with warm water and use the steamer. I was delighted with how easy and quickly I can make a restaurant quality espresso. I have made over 100 cups now and I checked the filters (they suggest cleaning at 200 cups) and they were still clear. The parts are easy to dissemble and reassemble for cleaning and the instructions (which you should read) are clear. I accidentally left the machine on all day (thankfully with water in it) and it's no worse for the wear. One tip, steam your milk first and then make the coffee; this is the most efficient way."
4,I'm impressed for the price,"I've only used the machine a few times so far, but I'm impressed. The machine makes great coffee with excellent crema. At first I was a bit worried as I turned the pump on and noting seemed to come out, but it seems you have to run it for a while to get all the air out of the pump. As others have noted, the cup outlet and the steam valve are a bit low, so you are a bit restricted as to what vessels you can use. I haven't had too many problems with the tamper, and I understand that this was probably a necessary cost saving to achieve the price. All in all a good machine for the cost conscious coffee drinker.Update: About three weeks after purchasing this, it stopped producing coffee. I am not sure if it just needs cleaning, but I'll report back when I've tried."
1,Too small to be useful,"Ok, first off it's SMALL, did I say smallDue to its size, getting the handle to sit properly is really tough and there are a lot of hot spots on the unit if you try and use the other hand to keep the unit from sliding around while trying to attach the handle.Due to the size a Cappucino cup will not fitEspresso is fine.If you have a space issue, then this would be ok. Otherwise look at another brand."
5,Great coffee,"The machine arrived quickly and in great shape.It makes a great espresso, without even considering the fact that it is so cheap. I love this machine.It works a lot faster than what the instructions suggest, but this is a plus not a minus.No complaints so far, everything works just fine."
1,VALVE MISSING FOR WATER TANK.,I ordered this machine with my prime with my free 2 day shipping and actually recieved it the next day so I was excited to try it out. I proceeded to read the instructions and got everything ready. I then poured water into the tank and a minute later all of the water had leaked out all over the counter and onto the floor drenching the paperwork I had set down among other things. I fiddled with it and pushed down down on the tank while pouring in water with no success and finally realized there must not be any valve sealing the flow as described. Amazon is taking care of me though and sending a new one right now so my gripe is with De'Longhi for not having good quality control on their manufacturing. Will update if I ever recieve a functioning unit.Thanks to Amazon for great cooperation!
1,Not Good for Everyday Use!,"I purchased this product recently and was not happy with it at all. Water must be pre-heated for 15 minutes before making espresso. It just took too long! After 6 days of everyday use, it broke. I returned it and purchased the Breville Cafe Roma Espresso Machine instead. The Breville machine was 100% better. It takes absolutely no time pre-heating the water. Once you turn the power on, almost instantly it's ready to go. The Breville makes the perfect espresso and milk foam. It was more money but worth it. It will save you a lot of time!!"
5,excellent espresso for a correct price,I've bought this machine because of its relatively low price and since it is pump-driven (those machines are usually much more expensive).I cannot distinguish the quality of the espresso produced by this machine from the one you get in a good restaurant and this is all that counts for me. Moreover it is easy to handle and I didn't have any technical problems so far (as is often the case with espresso machines).
5,Awesome espresso machine!,"Gave this espresso machine to my daughter for a Christmas gift. In her own words below.....I love this espresso machine. I was previously using a basic Krups prior to getting this machine for Christmas. It was an easy set up & very user friendly after reading through the directions for use. Had a tough time in the begining getting used to the frother, which thanks to reading a review here on Amazon from someone else w/ the same problem... don't follow the directions, just keep the tip barely under the spout, just enough to get the swirling motion & froth will come. The frothing spout has only one down side; it is a little too close to the counter & I have to tip the machine to get the frothing pitcher in & out from under the spout. Which doesn't bother me. I highly recommend buying this espresso machine if you already have a smaller one that you have figured out/ practiced on to make espresso & are looking for a good intermediate machine."
5,Great value for money!,"Is this a professional espresso maker? NO. Is this a good home espresso machine? YES Great value for the money, pump not steam. Cannot go wrong for less than $150"
5,Surprisingly great espresso -- can't do better for the $$,"Tiny, convenient machine delivers a nice cup. The Easy-Serve Pods are super-convenient -- I recommend the Lavazza Grand Crema. If you need to turn out a lot of coffee/froth, you'll probably want something with a bit more heft. But for typical home or small office, this is a great deal."
4,Good Value,I purchased the DeLonghi EC155 Espresso maker Oct/09. My old (steam driven) system had died... I wanted a good value espresso maker without spending a ton of money. As I researched products it became evident that a 'pump' action maker was the most preferable. This product seemed to have good reviews and a great price.After using the product for several weeks I am recommending it. It is clearly the best value for the money and makes EXCELLENT espresso! On the downside there is not enough room between the spout and my espresso cups which caused me to buy new 'shorter' espresso cups... a small price to pay for a great cup of espresso.
3,Great Espresso Maker for < 1 year,"I bought this espresso maker < 1 year ago and it has already broke. It makes excellent espresso and was amazing for the price, I just did not realize it was a disposable and that is why it is so cheap."
4,tiramisu,"This machine is awesome. I love this.The other inconvenient thing for me is the machine itself is not very tall,sometimes it's not very convenient when you're boiling the milk/making frost using thesteam pipe. Other than that, it's an awesome machine."
2,not ok,This machine could only make one shot at a time/ can't deal with that. For us it would have taken all morning to make 2 lattes. RETURNED THE MACHINE!!!
1,It was used,I ordered this from the super saver deal from amazon. It arrived in a box that was unsealed and obviously had been opened before it got to me. When I removed it the plastic bag had obviously been opened and replaced. the cord was just wrapped around the center and the silver had scratches and fingerprints on it. It looked used. Or it was a return item from someone else.Now I am trying to return it to Amazon and printed out the forms and put it back in the box. Except UPS has not shown up to pick it up. So it sits in a box in my hallway waiting for a refund. I am disappointed to say the least.
1,Do NOT buy this machine!,"I wouldn't even have given it one star, but the system wouldn't allow me to put ZERO! This machine broke after TWO weeks. Week two the heating element refused to heat up enough to work properly. Green light never came on...after leaving the unit on for hours. Even with ""pre-heating"" techniques...it STILL would not heat up to maximum. Could not have been overuse. Used it once, perhaps twice a day. Pay more for a higher quality machine. The adage ""you get what you pay for"" most definitely applies here."
4,Expresso machine,"This is the best size, doesn't take up much counter space & makes a great late! I needed to put a piece of tile under it to make the frother fit the cup height better, but all in all it is a great product for the price."
2,Not the best,"Have in the last few years owned several affordable espresso machines. Each took some getting used to and I did. This De'Longhi EC155 was rated favorably by Consumer Guide. The area for a container to sit is so small that even a tea cup would not fit under the spout. I tried 3 different grinds of beans in various amounts but always had grounds in the espresso. Tamping the grind (or not) did not solve this problem. In the end, I returned the product even though there is no guarantee that a full refund will be issued. Am very disappointed."
1,Wait at least 15 monutes????,"I have not even started to use it. I read the instruction and was dumbfounded... With the previous model it took 1 push of a button and ~1 minute to preheat the water, and another push to have your espresso ready in 2 more minutes at most. Now it a cumbersome several-step process, a stupid rotating knob, and a mandatory 15 (say, FIFTEEN) minutes for preheating. Reading about the ""rapid"" option nearly gave me a heart attack :-) Like I have time and desire to do it in the morning... Boy am I glad I didn't threw away the old one yet. I'll try to order parts and fix it. It stopped dispensing water, apparently there is a problem with the pump. Maybe it's be worth it. The old one was perfect and served me for 9 years. Maybe I'll manage to find a new old one."
1,"Loud, shaky, difficult to clean","The espresso was delicious. But we had to return the machine. It sounds like a blender when turned on, and shakes so badly that you have to hold the cups in place as it's brewing. It's very difficult to clean - lots of little parts and gaskets to take apart. It takes a long time to heat up, and there's not a lot of room between the base and the filter - we had to make espresso into a short bowl, as we didn't have espresso cups. No mug could fit under there. Tamper stinks, and no froth cup is included."
1,Dead On Arrival,"After spending more than a little time checking reviews I decided on this model for a Christmas gift based on the many positive reviews. On Christmas morning we were expecting to have a nice hot cup of Cappuccino after shoveling snow but instead all we got was aggravation trying to get this thing to work. I contacted Delonghi support on the next business day and they said that the pump was probably defective and suggested I return it through Amazon. Amazon didn't charge for return shipping but it was still a hassle having to process the return, repackage everything back up and bring it to a UPS drop off location. Luckily I hadn't yet sent in the UPC code off the box for the $20 rebate or else I probably would've been denied the refund. I'll buy my next Cappuccino maker from a local store."
4,Reliable coffee machine,Great coffee maker - frother is a bit tricky to handle as you need to tilt the machine up to fit the cup under it and then tilt it again to get it out but apart from that I was happy with it. That was until I discovered the wonders of hassle free Nespresso! Sorry De'Longhi!
1,disappointing,"I don't know... maybe it's operator error. I read the reviews, I thought I cold get this to operate but after many, many efforts I have abandon it. I've had espresso machines in the past and never had a problem. This is noisy, the ""green"" light that says it's hot enough to use stays on only a few seconds, then, what? I'm suppose to wait again when the cup is only one fifth full??? Just not a well thought out machine... at least for this gal..."
1,Poor Grade Product Made in China,"I purchased this machine and I had high expectations. It is after all a ""DeLonghi"". After testing it for 3 days, I decided to give up. The filter holder won't clip with the shot filter and won't position to the middle as shown in the photo. I will look for another DeLonghi, but only if it's made in Italy."
5,DeLonghi Espresso maker,"We love this espresso maker. Sure saves a lot of money over going to Starbucks and buying theirs. Makes great espresso, even with the foam. Milk steaming works great. Other reviews talk about there not being enough room under the frothing wand. This is true, but I use my system on the right side of our sink, which gives you plenty of room since you can hold your pitcher lower in the sink basin. System vibrates a little when your actually pumping the water through the espresso grinds. Have to keep an eye on your glass, as it tends to walk around on the base a little. Overall, we love it."
4,Great Espresso Maker,My husband has been wanting to get coffee shop quality expresso and this machine has met and exceeded his desires.
3,Not as great as I would have liked for making Cafe Latte,"Works good but here are my complaints: You do have to wait for it to heat up, it's a pain to get a cup under it so if you want latte you can't just use one cup - you have several coffee cups to deal with. The tamper is inefficent and makes a mess - I ordered another one. But, all in all, I'm still happy with it. It makes a good flavored cup of expresso (latte)."
3,Unfortunately Not for the Long Haul,"I upgraded to a pump machine with this unit, and have been very happy with it; however, I do make several cups a day, and often leave it on between them. Apparently it's not made to stand up to this type of regular use: after just about a year, I'm having a problem with intermittent but serious leaking--from various parts of the machine.I'm really sad--it's been great, and the coffee is delicious. But it looks like I'm going to have to replace it, and probably with something more substantial."
3,It's okay...it does the job,"This machine is fine if you just drink espresso. If you're looking for a budget espresso maker and you don't plan to make cappuccinos or lattes, this will probably do just fine. Otherwise, you might want to spend the extra money and get something that will do the job better."
3,Good espresso,Works good I like the fact that it is easy and fast would recommend this to buy for the price
4,Generally happy with product,It makes good espresso with creama and it forths (and heats) the milk nicely. The frothing wand is not long and you have to have the demi cups to fit under the coffee part.
4,I would say I like it,Not a bad espresso machine for the price.pros- It quickly gets ready for espresso shot- Small and lightcons- can't put fine coffee; you don't want to grind the coffee beans too much.
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Purchased for my son for Christmas, He was elated, better than he thought it would be. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great for the price!,"My husband bought this espresso maker for me for christmas this year. I love it! I use it everyday! The maker its self doesnt look cheap. If you know how to use an espresso maker or not this one is really pretty easy to use. I worked at Starbucks for 3 years so this maker was easy to use and fast. It takes about 10 min to heat up. I did notice after making 2 or 4 coffees you have to fill up the water in the back of the maker. That was everyother day for me so its not that bad. I would suggest that you buy espresso shot glasses, a frothing pitcher and frothing thermometer. Those will make it your espresso maker much more better. Dont wast your money on a tamper. The maker has one on the maker and its perfect. No need to buy one. The maker also makes very good foam and very fast. You dont even really need to try to make the foam it does it on it own. So that was nice. This is a great maker for everyday use and if you are looking for something simple and easy."
2,HORRIBLE QUALITY CONTROL,"This is our 3rd (and LAST!) De Longhi expresso maker.The first one broke after a month. The replacement had a cracked water tank, right out of the box and the last one (this one) burned the pump after two months! Even though we cleaned all relevant parts MORE often than the manual even suggests. We are still waiting for a replacement...While it worked, the coffee was good but, 2 months is way too short a life span for a product of this type. And three defective units out of three is too high an average for us to waste out time with De Longhi products again."
2,Disappointed in performance after six months.,"Although it would have been great to have the unit about 2"" taller, the performance at first was great. After about six months, the unit suddenly stopped creation of LaCrema and no longer made the traditional 'whooshing' sound, plus takes four times longer for coffee to drip through filter. Followed instructions on cleaning although could not locate 'citric acid' so used white vinegar. Disassembled and cleaned all of the filters. Still no improvement. Has anyone else had this problem and figured out next step to improve performance?"
3,Very nice,"Makes a great espresso, but the frothing wand is in such an awkward spot. I had this thing for a few years and got use to the issue, but it would seem that DeLonghi would some up with a better design."
2,Leaky...,"I have had mine for almost a year now and up until 4 months ago I would have given it 5 stars except it now leaks from underneath and also out the back. When I turn the knob it will either make an espresso or a floor, it's hit and miss. I had read many great reviews on amazon before buying and no one really mentioned this. Now that it's happening I notice this is a common problem from reviews on other websites such as coffeegeek. It used to make great coffee though and I have got a great deal of use out of it for the price."
1,"Defective, and replacement part unavailable","Bought the espresso machine as a holiday gift. Upon opening, noticed that the valve was missing from the water tank. After multiple emails to customer support and many pings for updates, they finally said that the part was backordered. Now, over 6 weeks later, no part. Returned for refund."
5,love this machine,"As a novice expresso brewer, I read most of the reviews here before purchasing the EC155. I love expresso but I knew what I was getting into before I decided to buy my own machine. If I didn't pay an arm and a leg for an expensive expresso maker, I get what I pay for, right?Wrong. I love this machine. The froth is perfect, the temperature is fine, if you warm your cup first, or if you wait a little while. You don't need to wait a half hour. I haven't used pods yet, so clean-up takes a little while, especially if you want a second cup- as I ALWAYS do.I am very happy with the DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker."
4,Amazing machine for the $$$,"I have had this machine for about a month. No problems so far. It makes a good cup of espresso. The steamer wand is low, but works well. I would suggest getting low profile coffe cups. Overall a great machine for the money."
4,delonghi espresso maker,Functions very well and as advertised. I would recommend it. Cappucino also very good.Instructions clear and helpful. Cleaning and ease of use also very good.
1,NO GOOD,This device only lasted 4 months being used only once a day and that wasn't even every day. Now it is DEAD. No steam. Cold espresso. Called customer service and left a message 2 days ago and still no response. This is a piece of crap machine.
3,Good deal for the price,"This is the first espresso maker we have owned. It was a good deal for the price & it's a good machine for beginners like us. There was a learning curve as far as using the components. In the future, I would like to purchase an automatic machine so all I have to do is push a button. The downfall of this machine is that it's a lot of work & clean up for an espresso."
5,great!,"This espresso maker is great! it makes a real espresso, always creamy through the special device it has, and the price was the same of the 'steam ' machines I had seen in NY before looking on amazon. Moreover I used the free shipping and it has been sent by ups (or some other high speed postal service) and arrived in a few days!"
1,"Too short, bad steamer....",Can I return it? The steamer doesn't work well at all. it just dilutes the milk without heating it well.
5,Love this thing,No need to spend $500 plus dollars on a Espresso maker because this ones great. Great machine with a great price. I bought this for my boyfriend because he loves espresso and he loves it. It also makes cappuccinos which I love so that was quite the bonus. Great product.
5,Espresso Freak,"I love this little espresso machine. I used to run a coffee shop and thought I would never get the same flavor. Well with this little machine I can achieve that at home!! It has saved us so much money! I have owned this little machine since Sept of 09. It has brewed a lot of cups of espresso and it is still chugging away. Some people have given it bad reviews because they can't fit a foaming mug under the spout. I have not had this problem, because the machine is so light I can turn it to the side and steam the milk over the side of the counter. Most of the time I do not need to do this, it depends on how much milk you are heating. So if you are thinking of getting this product please do it is amazing!"
3,Espresso Machine,I needed to fiddle with it for about an hour and disassembled and assembled before I got it to work. This was my first time so I expected to struggle a little. Pretty good results.
4,Good value. Surprisingly good for its size,"I bought one of these for my dorm. It's been great. There are 2 separate temperatures for the steam wand and main unit which produces a high quality final product. I've worked with machines four times this size and I'm still impressed by the ""jet steam"" wand and nice resulting cremas on all my espresso drinks. There is, however, a bit of a lag time while the steam wand heats up after the espresso has been made. I've only ever used commercial machines so this is something I didn't expect. Compared to preparing coffee for larger espresso makers, tamp less firmly and use less coffee and the drip speed should turn out well."
3,Good except design of frothing arm,This espresso maker is easy to use and quickly produces quite good espresso with a good crema if you follow the instructions and tamp the grounds down a bit first. But the milk frothing extension has a significant design flaw -- the way it's designed it's impossible to use anything but a very shallow container - otherwise the frother doesn't go far enough below the surface of the milk. Using such a shallow container means the milk starts spilling over as soon as you have a decent froth going. I've given up and just use it to make espresso -- I use a separate handheld frother for the milk when making capuccino. It's hard to believe the manufacturer didn't spot this problem -- don't they test their products at design stage?
2,only makes one good latte,"This machine spits out too much water when it steams the milk, watering down the steamed milk and once you make a double shot of expresso the moter is not strong enough to make a second double shot, so you have to do single shots to make an extra latte. I will give it to my college daugter becasue she only has to make one latte per morning and I will find another machine that can make more than one latte per session."
1,Not so Great,"I just got this and set it up, all excited to make espresso...Read the instructions, waited the 15 minutes, the green light came on much earlier but I waited...I was only running water through it (it says run 5 cups of water through before you use grounds). Turn the knob, lots of noise! No water! Steam yes, water no. Turn it off, try again, wait 1/2 hour...still nothing but noise. I'm returning it for another one. I hope this doesn't happen with the second one..Has anyone had this kind of problem? The reviews are certainly mixed but mostly positive so I went for it....Wish me luck."
1,Not worth it,"Very small unit, normal cups will not fit under the spout. I had to hold this lightweight with all my strength just to get the filter cup secure. The instructions say it takes a half hour to heat up, although they offer a suggestion for faster heat up by running some water through it. Cheap compared to the low-line Krups I had. It was out of the box for fifteen minutes and I said to myself, nope, it's just not worth it, so back it goes."
2,Too small and doesn't heat up well enough,You have to use a very small container for this machine and the water doesn't heat up enough to get a hot cup of coffee. Would not recommend!
2,De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker.,"Unfortunately when this arrived it blew our house fuses , I then discovered it was 120 v , Australian power source is 240 v . Because the return shipping cost was AU$75 I decided to purchase a voltage step down converter for AU$100 , which I am still waiting forUntil this arrives and i can try the coffee maker I do not know if it has been damaged or not I would like to see International Electrical product sales , including the suppliers, emphasize this information so that willing customers do not have the same problems, as I am sure it will put people off considering these types of sales."
2,Too complicated,This espresso and cappuccino maker may make excellent coffee etc. but I never got beyond the instructions. They made preparation sound like a project which would not work in the am when I'm short of time getting ready for work. What led me to return the item was the cleaning instructions which involved unscrewing parts with a screw driver.
3,Good coffee maker but,I you a person who drinks more than 4 espresso than this machine is not for you It is difficult to clean and you can only use espresso cups which a real problem for me other than that it makes great espresso .
2,a piece of junk,"This machine leaks from every possible place! Leaks from inside the machine, into the tray, all over my counter and the floor. It uses 20 oz. of water to make a double espresso.... most of which is leaking out everywhere! What a piece of junk. I'm returning it as soon as possible."
1,Pretty Good Machine if You Get One That Works,"I've purchased six of these machines. Two of them worked - one for a year or so and the latest for a week or so. One reason I've bought six is because Amazon has such an easy return policy. The other reason is that, based on reviews, I can't seem to find another machine that is trouble free within my price range of $200 + or so."
4,Love it but...,"I've had this machine for about 6 months and use it almost everyday. It was recommended and had good reviews. The price was reasonable, under $100 bucks. I love it but there are a few things that are annoying. I set the machine on a cutting board because the steamer wand is too low to work with. The built-in tamper is useless (I bought a nice metal one). The swivel lock that's built into the handle, to hold the one and two shot measure cup, doesn't. The cup falls out of the handle when I try to empty the coffee grounds. Overall, It works fine, is easy to clean, and holds plenty of water. Also, I can make a one and two shot espresso. Update: 1/21/2013, I've used this machine for over a year now and I haven't had any problems. It make a good shot of espresso and I've found that keeping pressure on the swivel lock while you empty the ground will keep the little cup from falling out with the ground:)"
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this espresso maker as a Christmas gift for my son, who was thrilled to open it on the big day. Unfortunately, when he set it up to make some tasty drinks later that afternoon, we found that the water container inside the machine leaks all over the place. We've read the directions meticulously and followed each one, but as soon as we turn the machine on after filling the container, water flows all over the counter. This espresso machine is definitely going back."
1,Defective :o(,I didn't even try to get a replacement. The filter holder wouldn't fit or turn. No cups! I have had 2 other espresso machines and know how they work so was really surprised when I couldn't get the filter to lock in.
1,It was opened and used one!!!,"I was looking forward to receiving this espresso maker. But when it arrived, I found out there was water inside the water chamber and inside the plastic bag that wrapped the product!!! There was no way water could get inside the plastic bag without leaving any water mark outside the box. The box was clean and outside of the plastic bag was clean. It was definitely opened and used one. How could you AMAZON send a customer a used product for the price of new one?. My experience with Amazon was very good until now. I cannot believe it happened. I am calling the customer service right now....OK...---- I just called the customer service and I only heard that they will resend the item and let me return this already USED product back to them. I wanted to hear Amazon's explanation about ""the water in the water chamber situation"" but there was no person who could reasonably explain this situation. Really angry!!!"
1,Not for espressos.. do not buy,"I purchased this espresso maker after reading many reviews and seeing that at least 500 persons rated it with 5 stars. Big mistake i made. I followed all instructions and even waited the 30 minute preheat instruction that the manual said, used different brands of coffee, grounded coffee myself, and still no creme on my espresso. I re-read reviews, searched google and youtube to see what I am doing wrong and let me warn you: this machine does not make espressos, it makes a soupy mess as several reviews here have stated.I regret having bought this and unfortunately cannot return it since I live outside the US and returning it would cost me as much aas its price."
2,cheaply made,"If you're looking for a cheap plastic lightweight imitation of a real espresso machine, this is for you. I'm sure it works well, but I will stick to my old reliable solid espresso pot for now."
1,NO SPACE,"THE AREA BETWEEN WHERE THE COFFEE COMES OUT IS NOT ENOUGH TO A REGULAR SIZE CUP TO CATCH THE COFFEE. TO HEAT OR WHIP THE MILK IS ALSO NOT LONG ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO DO A LITTLE AT A TIME AND WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THE READY LIGHT TO COME ON.BEFORE DOING THE MILK YOU HAVE TO LET ALL THE WATER OUT BEFORE ANYTHING OR ELSE YOU'LL HAVE WATERY MILK.THE READY GREEN SHUTS DOWN TO FAST. I DON'T BUT THEIR HAS TO BE SOMETHING BETTER EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE MORE. THE COFFEE TURNS OUT ALRIGHT BUT I'M A DISSATISFIED BEGINNER. NOW I KNOW FOR NEXT TIME."
1,Electrical items for use outside USA,Electrical goods for use in Australia are 240v. I need an adapter before I can use this coffee maker. Perhaps buyers need to be warned before ordering
1,lento y no duradero,"Se lo regale a mis padres, estubieron fascinado con el resultado del café, pero se demoraba 1 hora en hacerse el cafe hasta que dejo de funcionar. La dejaron prendida y se quemó, les duro 3 meses."
4,"Great Value, Very Pleased","I have the EC155 at work and the more expensive EC270 at home. The EC155 is definitely superior: It makes good espresso, it's fairly quiet, it's cheaper, and it's easy to use. More importantly, it doesn't have any of the flaws that the EC270 has (leaky water tank, noisy pump, awkward drip tray, etc.). The EC155 isn't as pretty as some other machines, and you can't fit tall cups under the filter, but overall I'm very happy with it and might end up replacing my EC270 with one."
5,Excellent At-Home Espresso Machine,"I'm greatly enjoying the espresso I get from this machine. My Saturday mornings consist of making a latte for the wife and a straight single shot for myself, both of which turn out consistently delicious every time. After using it several times a week for the past four weeks, my only real problem with the machine is how low to the countertop the steam wand is, which isn't too big of a deal to me. The quality of the espresso is excellent and the price on Amazon makes it a very affordable solution for anyone wanting good-quality espresso at home without having to spend over $300. It's even got a relatively small footprint, which is good for people with limited counter space/cabinet storage. I would definitely recommend this product."
2,"OK, but not great",Have been using one of De'Longhi steam powered units for years without problems. Ordered this to upgrade to faster and better results. Found I could make repeat cups faster and easier with my old machine. This required too much cool down/heat up between cups. I found the coffee did not improve with the pump unit as I thought it would. The cup height is a definite issue and can only be attributed to design flaw/lack of testing. I returned it. Still using my old steam unit.
1,huge disappointment,"I tried using different ground coffees still the result was sour tasting watery liquid with barely any foam.I am very disappointed,reading the reviews I expected so much more,I own a Krups esspresso machine and I wasn't happy w the coffee it was making but after purchasing this I started appreciating my Krups.It is definitely going back."
2,Good...For 2 months,"This was a reasonably priced espresso maker. It worked well for 2 months. Then the frother stopped working. Amazon would not replace it free of charge, nor would Delongi. Delongi charges $15 and you must cut the cord off the machine and pay to mail it and the $15 to the company. Amazon offered to charge a ridiculous ""restocking fee"". Be aware that these are your options, should your machine break. Disappointed in Amazon for this one."
2,Plastic Taste,It worked fine but the expresso tasted like the water tank smelled - even after I washed the tank with a mild dish soap and ran several water only cycles through it. Had to send it back to Amazon.
1,Three months of use and poor/no customer service,I received this for my birthday in Nov 07. You need the large filter to get enough espresso for my size lattes. It clogged on 2/11/08. I cleaned and cleaned it per the directions wasting a lot of ground beans trying to get the filter to work. I was told I would be sent a new large filter. Still waiting. Called back 2 weeks ago and still nothing. Requested to return my machine and I got nothing from customer service.DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker
1,Jumpy Mess,"I'm no newbie to espresso machines. This thing was crazy. It vibrated so badly trying to make a simple espresso shot that it would jiggle the cup off the platform. I've never seen anything like it. Either the machine is too light, or I received a lemon. I'm sending it back. Don't waste your time."
3,vibration,"The plate that the cup(s) sit on vibrates to the point that the cups move. I'm working on isolating the plate using surgical tube as ""feet"" but the vertical distance between the plate and the nozzles is minimal allowing the plate to be minimally elevated. Any ideas would be appreciated.Also there has got to be a better way of fixing the coffee ground ""nest"" into the handle, maybe a simple 1/8 or 1/4 twist rather than the ""flip lock"" thing. Would actully be cheaper to make. Makes excellant cappaccino!"
3,"Changed my mind 3 star, still working after a 2+ years","1.) When I first got the machine the housing unit was cracked, but the shipping box looked perfect.2.) email, call the company, they told me to cut of 3"" of the power cord and write a letter, tell them what was wrong. (4-6 weeks)3.) The 2nd unit came under 3 weeks - Good News4.) Ran it with out coffee5.) Had my first Espresso*** it was just ok.*** IN the manual it say you need to let it heat up for 15-30mins. this is way to long.Working unit itself is a 3 star, probs. with the first unit minus one starUpside yes it not a $300 espresso making machine but for $70 it's O.K. avg. at best"
4,great machine for the price,"The DeLonghi EC155 is a sturdy, well built machine that makes great coffees. I have been using for the past month after having a steam Krups (which i loved). the espresso is more authentic (great crema) and the steamer is so easy, even a newbie would be able to make perfect foamed milk. It is super easy to clean. The instructions say to turn on for 30 minutes prior to making coffee. I have never waited this long and usually only wait 6-7 minutes while getting milk, coffee, etc prepared. My one remark is for those who have used steam type machines before such as the Krups, you can only make one or two at a time, not the four you may be used to. Therefore making a large beverage is more time consuming. Happy Espresso making."
4,quick espresso with good crema,"This was a quick replacement for my broken machine and itis a fast, easy and tasty espresso. I have yet to wait the 15-20minutes the manual directs. I like that the frother comes offfor quick cleaning. Machine always has water underneath on thecounter."
2,A De' Longhi Disappointment,"I own an older, smaller De' Longhi that is superior to this. My objections to this machine are numerous: it doesn't produce much crema at all; it rattles so much you have to hold onto the espresso cup to keep if from dancing off the side; not only is the frothing wand too low to the counter, as someone noted, but for the first second or two when it's turned on, a straight, hard stream of water--not steam--comes out, seriously diluting the espresso. I'm going back to my old De' Longhi."
3,Gave it away,"The golden mediocrity. Kept me going to Starbucks for coffee. Nobody wanted it after I decided to give it away, although it was still like new."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I love expresso and I wanted something for my office. Maybe I should have looked or investigated the features before I invest in it.My issue with it are :1. Too much vibration and the cup need to be held down sometimes to avoid bouncing off the platen2. No timer to turn off the brew, I wish it had turns of water when a specified volume had been dispensed.What do I like?The price."
2,Not worth bothering.,"I got this machine because people said it was OK for what it cost. Granted it does not cost a lot. Problem is it makes expresso and it foams milk, but by the time you get the two steps done it has all gone cold. This unit doesn't make the water hot enough and by time you put it all together it is just warm. Seems to take a long time for the water to get hot and doesn't stay that way. If you go to make more than one cup you will be waiting a long time between brews so don't plan on having friends over to get together for expessos unless you like to drink one at a time or have cold expesso. I guess if you want a good expesso you have to pay a lot more for a good machine or just go out."

1,Really a TOY -- AVOID THIS CRAP,"Cheap plastic, too small in stature, uses a FAKE CREMA gimmick handle.If you were happy with a $30.00 steam toy stay with that. And to make REAL espresso you must own a decent ESPRESSO grinder around $300.00 or you can use high priced stale pods, with a very limited selection.PLEASE please don't SOUR yourself or friends on espresso by thinking THIS is an espresso machine. It is NOT."
1,You get what you pay for,"I was hopeful based on some of the reviews, but ultimately disappointed by this machine.I bought this one to replace a 12 year old Starbucks model that finally died. Maybe I am a little spoiled by the old machine, but the first thing I noticed was the long heat and prep time suggested in the manual -15 minutes. Once ready, the steam flow was weak at best and took quite a while to prepare enough milk for one cup. Worse, the espresso pump was barely strong enough to pump out one shot of coffee, minus the crema. In short, underpowered and small. I will continue searching, but I suspect that there may not be a cheap answer to a great at home expresso machine."
5,Best value in coffee creme,"The coffee is excellent if you like espresso or black but foamy americano. I am very satisfied with this machine--very good value. Actually makes better coffee than the expensive machines in my opinion. Easy to use. But, I do not use the milk steamer--these are always messy anyway. I hope this machine lasts.A tip--make sure your cup is hot because the water temperature is not too hot to avoid burning the coffee. Also, do not squeeze the grounds to hard unless you really like very strong flavor."
2,The tremor is so that it makes the cups slide off the plate.,"The machine looked ok when still packaged. Once it was taken out, its tremor was enough to make the cups slide off the plate. It happened the first time that the cleaning, as required by the manual instruction, was started."
4,Ah Good Coffee,We are enjoying really good coffee with the De'Longhi Esspresso maker. I am not so skilled at doing the frothing - perhaps that takes time. But great coffee with good creme on it makes the morning great.I like the reserve water tank size.
4,Good as a starter,"the price point is good and even better with the rebate. BUT,the machine should be turned on to warm for a good 20/30 minutes (as per instruction) otherwise, espresso in not hot. Also the distance from the espresso spout to the stainless steel base is about 3.5 tall, making it difficult to use any old coffee cup. I find the coffee grind reservoir very shallow. I have to brew X2 to make decent latte."
1,Broke after a month of use,"I bought this machine because of the price, after two months of use the pump failed. I used to make a cup a day so it was not overused. I sent it to repair to an authorized shop in Texas and the machine never came back!!! not only Delonghi failed with the machine but also with the service and warranty. I would never ever buy this brand again."
1,Inconvenient,The low power of this machine causes it to delay very long to make espresso. It is poorly made and the one I bought did not work.
2,Works while it lasted,Have tried two. Both worked fine for awhile. But too soon the pumps fade along with the crema. Im trying someone else.
1,Good While It Lasted,"Purchased this item June of 2012, A mear 4 months ago. Should have paid attention to the reviews. Pump stopped working this morning, was so looking forward to a great cup of coffee, which this machine did produce. Very frustrating to pay good money for a product that quits pumping the water. DeLonghi needs to look closely at this item. I'll never buy this type again."
3,Works but has some issues ...,"First of all I like the small size of the unit since it takes up little room on my counter. But that comes at a price. There is very little clearance for anything but the smallest espresso cups (don;t think of trying to fit a normal mug or cup).You would also since they only thing that can fit under it is an espresso cup that the unit would dispense the right amount automatically. Nope, you have to manually turn it off when it reaches the right level.Final quirk is that the flow between the two nozzles is seldom even. One side always seems to get the bulk of the flow. Perhaps it is the way I load pods in it. But I only make a cup at a time so that is okay I guess. Which sums up my review. The unit is okay considering the price."
4,I really like this....... but,"So this machine can do something that my machine at work cannot do (Gaggia Classic); I can get a great pull using Lavazza pre-ground espresso with impressive amounts of creama. That said, I typically use Trader Joe's medium roast ground at the store and really enjoy the taste and overall am very happy with this machine. The issues, as I see it, are the following: steel cover on the catch try doesn't want to stay put, The wand is not high enough and the built in tamper makes a mess. None of these are a deal breaker- so yes I am happy"
1,takes too long!,"I just got this yesterday and have only used it 2x. Coffee is good - nothing extraordinary yet but I've yet to learn the nuances - but it takes too long. The manual suggests 'pre-heating' the machine for half an hour before making coffee. Half an hour! Really????? My stove-stop maker takes far less time.While searching for a good and inexpensive replacement to my old machine, I read hundreds of reviews including many dozens on this particular model and not one ever mentioned such an unreasonable wait time for espresso (in fact, many have indicated how quick the machine was). Either people aren't following manufacturer directions and still getting a great cup or the manufacturer has inexplicably redesigned a great product into something less.In any case, I'll experiment with timing and report back, but I am not pleased at the moment."
4,Great for cappucino lovers,"I use this little espresso maker every morning. It is easy to use, fairly quick and pretty easy to clean. Just like other reviewers said my only complaint is that the steamer arm is so short. And I would buy a tamper seperately because the one on the machine is too low and close to the coffee handle. I also soak the steamer arm weekly in a cup on vinegar and water so milk doesn't build up."
3,"good value for the price, milk steamer unreliable","makes great crema, takes long to heat up (30 - 40 min) and milk frother sometimes works like a charm, and sometimes does not."
2,Lots of design flaws and highly inconsistent,Bought this as a step up toMr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machinewhich sucked. This is truly a step up to that cheap product but still fails to deliver.Pros------1) Pretty good build quality as it has Stainless steel boiler2) Heats up pretty fastCons------1) Ridiculous steam wand. It is extremely short for a decent pitcher2) The steam wand tip is good for cappuccino but not latte3) Good luck trying to get a pitcher in and out of the steam wand. I have placed the machine on the left end of the counter top to make it easy.4) Attached tamper is a joke. Get a decent tamper.5) The result of the extraction/crema is highly inconsistent (My tamping is consistent)My search for a good espresso machine continues. I am sure I will have to spend much more to get that.
4,Great Espresso for The Price,"This is an excellent inexpensive machine that produces consistent espresso pulls and has a powerful steam wand. It heats up in around a minute and is easy to clean. To get the best pull however, I would wait around 20 minutes for everything to heat up properly. After 1 minute you can pull a shot but it won't be of the best quality.There are a couple of downsides but not at all deal breakers. First, the built in tamper is horrendous. It's nearly impossible to get even pressure, or enough of it, because it is attached to the machine. This results in low pressure pulls and a soupy mess of grounds when finished. Buy a 49mm metal tamper for $10. Second, the steam want is short. You really have to angle your frothing pitcher to get a steam head all the way into the milk. Once you get your technique down, it's much less of an issue.I have had this machine for about a month and use it daily. If you'd rather have espresso than drip, this is an inexpensive quality product."
1,What a disappointment!,"Cannot believe paying $34.15 (total) for this 3"" high piece of plastic in a scratched-up package made to hang from a wire at the grocery store. Product description inadequate, and so I am absolutely astounded at this item, which is not worth $3.00, no less $34.15. DO NOT buy this unless the kid in your life can't live without it. I'm shocked at this highway robbery AND at the condition of the packaging on arrival. The USPS packaging was pristeen, so this damaged package was SHIPPED in damaged condition. Thanks a heap, amazon."
4,Nice little intro!,This was a great book to introduce me to really using Quicken. It walked me through it without dumbing it down or making me hunt for a dictionary.
5,Great add on,"If you have windows 2000 server than this is for you. this is added onto windows 2000 server.

I could only tell you that is great for your buesiness. If you have a big company or small business. Trust me this will fit your needs."
1,Movie? What Movie?,"I would have love to see this movie,and provide an honest review, but apparently, I was shipped a blank disk! I tried to view it using three different DVD players and two different computers....NOTHING! NADA!"
2,Among Shleppers,"Pam Logan disappointed me because she never manages to deliver her book's promises. She bikes through China and Tibet, but offers few details about this type of travel; indeed, she spends half of the book on foot. She becomes obsessed by the Kham warrior people, but never actually enters their territory.She is admired by at least two local men, but circumspectly never reveals the outcome of those relationships. She is stopped by police at the Tibetan border, and never reveals the subterfuge by which she successfully crosses.And then, of course, there's all that claptrap about how travel is like performing karate exercises.Real travel books reveal their author's strategy for surviving the awful and the exotic. Logan reveals only her longing to be back in California, kicking and slashing ghosts."
4,Real Southern Soul,"During the mid sixties there was no greater sound in the Carolinas than Bobby Moore and the Rythmn Aces. I saw Bobby Moore at ART""S SEASIDE ( a small beach side club near Charleston SC that also featured groups like the TAMS. This was Southern Soul in its finest hour. Searching For My Love and Try My love Again are the big hits.While most of the songs are listenable, non reach the heights of these two hits."
4,good movie!!!,very funny movie! i very highly recommend. ryan reynolds and jason bateman did a great job!! i recommend this movie if you like to laugh!!!
2,Not for me,"This was different but unfortunately not great. It was predictable, gross and the characters in my opinion where too flawed and almost unbelievable. Mitch Planko (played by the always funny Ryan Reynolds)seemed fake and a man who was so stupid, empty emotional and selfish that you do not feel any type of empathy for him, the growth of his character was almost invisible.You start the movie with a dumb guy, you finish the movie with a dumb guy with a hot girlfriend, a very smart Sabrina McArdle (played by Olivia Wilde). And you know a woman like that will probably never end up with a shell of a man like Mitch Planko (even if it looks like Ryan Reynolds)Some funny jokes, weak story... I give it 2 stars."
4,Another underrated movie,"Yet, another movie that was really good that gets a mere 3 stars on Amazon. The shock!! Basically, morons review movies. If a movie on here gets 2-3 stars, it is usually great. If it gets 4-5 stars, there's a 50/50 it sucks."
5,Hilarious - Not for those who cringe when people curse...,"This is another great Jason Bateman flick for 2011 - I will be owning it along with Horrible Bosses! There is certainly a lot of cursing, nudity and other 'interesting' situations so it is not for those who can't appreciate the context or want to watch a movie with your kids (unless they have already graduated from HS)...As you can see form the reviews here this is a very polarizing movie - you be there judge!"
3,"Eh, it was ok","Was ok. Got it when the price dropped. Laughed a few times, cringed a few others. Definitely not for the kids. Overall, expected better from the two main actors, but I did laugh a few times."
1,Not a good movie,"There is no other way to say it, this is just a bad movie. I expected it to have some level of crude humor, but from the first word everything was about the F word. My wife and I normally like Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman movies, but this was just a bad movie. If you want a movie with a predictable plot, and extremely foul and crude language, you may like this. Save your $ and watch something else."
4,Old concept revisited with parental humor !,"The main idea of the plot has been done many times before with movies like freaky friday, 17 again, and many others. Now that the ovious is out of the way, my wife and I thought this was a funny movie. There were lots of situations you live as a parent show in this movie with a comic twist."
3,just ok,I liked the actors but overall this was a miss for me. Had a couple of laughs in there but nothing truly memorable.
1,Stupid movie,"I could only get through about 40 minutes of this movie before finally turning it off. The language didn't bother me, although it does become tiresome. However, it was very boring and dumb. I didn't see much comedy in it at all. I rented it via Amazon's VOD for 99, so at least it was cheap. That said, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie even if it was free."
1,Too much F word,This movie was not what I saw in the previews. It had nonstop F word this and that. I thought it would be a fun movie to watch with my friends and I am glad I previewed it. The movie was full of nasty frontal nudity. I tossed my copy as I couldn't recommend anyone watch it in good conscience. What a disappointment!
2,Meh...,"This video sucked. I really wanted to believe that this wasn't just another dumb lame switch up movie. But... it was a big letdown. Not the worst movie you'll see but it's so cliche and in line with all of the other terrible change up movies. I am a huge fan of Bateman and Reynolds but this didn't deliver. It had a few funny moments but not really much worth owning. If anything, just rent this or Netflix it. I'd say it's good for one watch then you'll be glad you didn't buy it."
3,Good story but WAY to much nudity,I really liked this story...but when you add innocent babies to ANY movie it kills the story with all that nudity AND cheating. The movie would have been funny and great otherwise. It would have been really fun without all the nudity. Why do we have to have SO MUCH nastiness in the movies we watch now-a-days??????????????? Some things are still unacceptable to a LOT of us so cool it!!! There are a LOT of us that want to laugh without the discomfort of having to watch so much SEX going on!!!!!!!
1,A supreme disappointment,"Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are perhaps two of the most enjoyable actors around. However, I could not have been more disappointed in a movie had I tried. I don't find the F bomb offensive if used for emphasis, however, in this movie, it is used constantly and in the presence of small children. In fact, it is the first word spoken in the movie. This is not funny and not humor. The porno scene with Reynolds was simply foul. One of the reasons why I was so offended is that these two actors don't carry off this behavior. I truly enjoy when an actor tasks a risk but this was the wrong risk for these two actors. The film stinks."
5,Hilarious,"This is such a great movie. At first I was a little skeptical with the whole changing places plot being that it has been done so many times in other movies. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I laughed the entire way through the movie. It is definitely not a family movie for kids. My husband and I love to watch this movie. Would definitely recommend for a good laugh."
2,Horrible,I'm so glad I watched this by myself. It would have been too embarassing to watch with anyone else. So raunchy.
4,A little overtop but good for a laugh.,I found some parts of the movie a little over the top as far as swearing and crude humor. However I would be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh. The storyline of people switching walks of life is a bit old but many of us can relate to one character or the other.
5,AWESOME MOVIE! A++++ SO FUNNY,"I really don't get the negative reviews about this movie! It was so funny from start to finish. I think Jason Bateman is so cute--I love watching him be the sarcastic straight man, and this movie offers him a chance to play a new kind of role. The comparison with the Hangover is pretty accurate, this is a bromance movie with NONSTOP laugh out loud moments and diologue. The first three minutes of the film had a gross out scene that almost made me puke, but the rest of the movie was comedy at its finest. I think everyone should give this a chance, especially if you hate work, obligations, like sarcasm, and extreme funny moments. A+++++++++++"
1,Waste of time,"There are many body-change movies, however, this is the worst I have ever seen.. lot of profanity and disgusting moments. Come on, those F-words occurring in every 5 sec do not make it funny."
1,Sadness,"I feel like I am taking crazy pills. This movie is about as low as it gets. I laughed a few times but really, this movie is about as vulgar, stupid, tasteless and about the biggest waste of time i can think of. Usually you want a movie that makes you feel good or you get a good message, or you at least were able to laugh without feeling manipulated. Not so with this trash. What a disappointment, especially with such great actors."
1,Yecch!,"My fiancee and I had heard good reviews of this movie and rented it through Amazon's streaming.Well, we couldn't stomach it much beyond the opening credits. Bathroom humor, if it was ever actually funny, ceased to be entertaining long, long ago.Maybe it has some good points but it is just so offensive in the beginning that, well, why bother? There are so many good movies out there; don't waste money on this one. Even when they will have it on the free list it will not be worth the price."
1,Morbidly pathetic and waste of acting talent,"Of the same ilk as Bridesmaids and the Hangover series.... appeals to tween to twenties (reality or mentally) who are stoned. Just sad waste of talent and amazing these actors agreed to this debacle of a movie.Oh well, at least I rented it and didn't buy this boondoggle of a cinamatic wretching experience."
3,The Change-Up,"A lot of the humor in this film is potty humor like ass, farts and poo. I can see why some jokes were offensive but I still laughed. Nothing really special here."
1,The Change-Up,"The concept of this film sounded interesting and entertaining, however, the foul language was such that I couldn't even watch the film. It was a waste of my time and money."
1,Wow did not like,"I find both Jason Bateman and Ryan Renolds to be pretty funny actors, so I was really looking forward to this movie.Ugh... did not like it.The plot was weak.... the f-bombs (which I use I'm not prude) were non-stop and after awhile stopped being anything other than annoying....I couldn't care about either character, or the plot or what happened......I wouldn't waste your time...."
1,Very disappointed,"This movie was such a disappointment. With Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman it should have been a no brainer to check out. I was wrong. Lame over used jokes and crappy acting. Just because The Hang over and Bridesmaids have made the R rated comedy come back, they had a good story line. This was a waste of time....."
2,Good Comedy Lost in Bad Language....,"From the time I saw the previews on TV for this movie, I wanted to see it. The movie was funny, and had a good plot line. The problem? The F word is one of the only words the two male characters know...I think that swearing has a place and time in a movie and it can make or break it. For me, it broke it. I would watch the movie again but I would prefer it to be the censored version. The other complaint I had about the movie was all the sex. It was almost like watching a porno...Wow. How many times can Ryan Reynolds get laid????"
1,"""Sing The Dinner Song"" ~ Keep Singing Jason, It's The Only Funny Scene In The Film","I don't think I'm alone when I ask the film industry to please move on from the old reliable body swap plots and find something a little more original, PLEASE...! What makes matters even worse than the use, or misuse (a much better word) of this overused, tried and true plot is that it was not only bad, it was insulting. How accomplished and usually very funny actors such as Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds could co-star in such a monstrosity is beyond me. While there were a few scattered comedic moments here and there worthy of a laugh or two, I found the film overall to be nothing more than bathroom humor run amok, the likes of which one would expect in films such as 'Hangover I & II. It was too long as well."
1,Terrible!,"Don't waste your time. This movie was a dissapointment. Thought it would be great, considering cast, but the movie was weak. Didn't even finish the entire thing."
2,Disappointed,"I love Jason Bateman and I really like Ryan Reynolds. However I was disappointed in this movie. There were some funny moments but some like the ""movie"" scene that Ryan Reynolds shot as Jason Bateman's character were just gross."
3,The Change-Up,"This is the funniest film I've seen since THE HANGOVER. I didn't expect too much of the film, but when I watched it, it was laugh out loud funny. Really good job done by the cast."
2,"Good for ""don't have to think"" movies","As long as you go in expecting nothing, you won't be disappointed. This movie is kind of funny, but don't expect anything serious, meaningful, or profound from it. As long as your expectations are set, then you will enjoy seeing it. Too much gratuitous dirty language, but that goes along with the kind of movie it was."
2,"I had such high hopes, sadly it didn't deliver","After seeing the previews several times I decided this was a movie I looked forward to seeing. Sadly, it wasn't all that great and here's why...1. I usually like this type of movie, but does every other word need to be an ""F"" bomb? I don't mind the occasional use of swears for humor purposes, but they lose all meaning when overused. That was definitely the case here.2. I expected it to be funny. Admittedly, there were a few scenes that made me laugh, but not many. There were several opportunities to poke fun at things, but this movie sadly missed the mark.3. It almost seemed like they tried to go for a bizarre Hangover 'WTF' type of funny at some places. In my opinion it didn't work and should have been either removed altogether or rethought.Would I recommend people watch this movie? If you have an hour and a half to waste or nothing better to do I would say go for it. Otherwise, it probably isn't worth it."
4,I'm not sure why but I laughed out loud,"This movie is raunchy, predictable, crude, and completely unoriginal but it's also hilarious. My wife and both laughed out loud. Maybe we watched this movie in just the right mood or it caught us at just the right time but we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it's certainly worth renting.posted on Amazon and Netflix"
3,Very Crude,"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I needed to for this movie. I loved Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman, and thought the story had a lot of promise. The crude humor and ""F"" word was just a little over the top and not necessary. If they had taken it down a couple notches it would have been even better.If you are ready for over the top situations...it will be funny and you will be fine. Just consider yourself warned."
4,To funny,"Even though it's all been done before so to speak it was the r version, but they just played it up so well."
5,As described,Was exactly as described. As close to new as you can get. Easy payment process and shipment was quick. No complaints.
3,"Some laughs, but just OK.","Two friends inadvertently change bodies, assuming each other's life until they are able to reverse the curse that has been placed. While enduring this, they are able to learn about one another, while also appreciating the lives that they have. This is a storyline that we have seen before, and this film does nothing to improve the concept. This is definitely an adult comedy, and it does contain some funny moments. The characters are likeable and I was laughing out loud at times, but overall this is a movie that does not raise the bar of modern comedy in film. It meets the bar just enough to get a modest recommendation."
4,CHANGE UP REVIEW /RENTED FROM VIDEO ON DEMAND SERVICE,THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE BUT NOT FOR CHILDREN DUE TO THE PROFANITY.THE INSTANT STREAMING MOVIE SERVICE FROM AMAZON IS VERY NICE AND WORKS WELL
5,Hilarious!!!!!!,"Great movie! Extremely funny! At first I was aprehensive because it seemed like it would be like every other movie where the charters ""switch places""...but the plot went above and beyond that."
2,I don't understand,"I love Jason Bateman, but I really don't understand why he made this film???? Obnoxious and gross does not NECESSARILY EQUAL FUNNY. When switching places movies happen, isn't the point for the characters to experience something they've never experienced before??? How much of a stretch would it be for a young married guy to - Oh My Gosh - imagine what it is like to be a single guy?! Wasn't he single not that long ago? They might as well make a movie about a college student who magically becomes a high school senior!!!"
3,Tough it out - the last hour is good,Yet another body-swap Freaky Friday rip-off. I'm never a big fan of R-rated comedies because of the gross-out humor that is way too trendy today. That's great for 11-year olds but this is supposed to be for adults. And this movie starts out with gross humor right out of the gate and flirts with during the first 3/4 of the movie. But the whole movie is redeemed by the last half-hour or so. There is a good message delivered and the actors pull it off very well. I almost shut the movie off several times but toughed it out and enjoyed the last half.
4,Starts off a little slow but ends up being a pretty good comedy,"The movie started out funny, fizzled for about 20 minutes but ended up being pretty funny.Both actors are believable in the portrayal of two guys who switched bodies. This isn't a raunchy comedy it's more of a chick flick. Overall several laughs were had. This movie is much funnier than ""Horrible Bosses"". Not as funny as Cedar Rapids though.I would recommend watching it."
3,good,I rented this movie and thought it was pretty funny. I wouldn't buy it or suggest paying more than a dollar to rent it though.
2,Piling it on,"Piling on the reasons for making this an ""R"" rated film at the very beginning turned me, and my 18-year old son, off before we'd watch 10 minutes. More f-bombs, sexual innuendo and drug use, as well as constant denigration of the main female character...we really didn't like it at all."
2,Wasted potential,"I like body switch movies because life is more interesting when you walk around in someone else's shoes awhile. The problem with this movie, and a few others recently unleashed, is that it seems we've regressed back to the 1980s, when showing boobs was the thing to do, even if we didn't understand why. Now, as then, it's pretty pointless and it doesn't do anything for the story. It made the entire movie difficult to watch, and that's too bad, because there's actually a pretty good movie in there - if you can just dig it out from under the trash."
3,Change-Up,"This movie was very funny, but had a bit too much foul language, nudity & Sexual sense in it for me to really enjoy it. It was very disappointing to find these two actors (Jason Bateman & Ryan Reynolds) would act in a movie with such vulgar content. I really enjoy their movies in the past although Ryan is more likely to act in this movie then Jason. This movie would have been extremely funny if they would have toned it down on Ryan's role (the single guy) with all the sex and language. Basically the two guys (Jason - family man & Ryan - Single pot smoking/womanizer) switch bodies & try to deal with each others lives.I would not recommend this movie for anyone that does not enjoy listening to bad language, nudity & sex senses cause there is at least 50%. If you don't mind all this then it is a very funny movie."
2,Crude and inane,"If you are amused by a totally unbelievable story line combined with bad language and crude behavior, like Borat or Hotel New Hampshire, then this movie is for you. The acting is respectable but my wife and I just couldn't stomach the screenplay; it's simply not possible that a lawyer, soon to be partner, could make decisions like those portrayed in this film. It's not possible that their behaviors would have been tolerated by others. My wife and I enjoy a good slapstick (e.g. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and Home Alone) and/or a comedy with a smidgen of thought and depth, but this film is neither.We turned it off after about 30 minutes and watched The Bachelor with Chris O'Donnell. Itself not a very deep or believable film but we enjoyed it far more."
1,So inappropriate!,"I've seen most of Ryan Reynolds' movies and they are fairly tame, this movie on the other hand, is comparative to the lewdness of The Hangover 2. Do not watch this with anyone you might be embarrased of seeing graphic nudity with or hearing shocking sexual references. The dialogue is so shocking and offensive that I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped. This is not a script I would have expected either main actor to gravitate towards but I guess I was wrong. It really is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I appreciated the first Hangover with all it's graphic content but this is just too much. Do not waste your time, you will feel gross after watching it."
1,Purely Pathetic,"1. Man, this is one of those movies where you actually feel... sorry about the state of humanity or at least Hollywood for putting forth such completely pathetic ""comedy"". The movie is so contrived, the acting is lousy, the characters are so pathetic by their quest to appear so cool.2. The only more concerning about the ""lameness"" of this film is the audience to which it caters to. Please do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to this film; it is really bad material for all humanity."
1,Foul!,"Not what I saw on the previews. Thought it would be a cute comedy.......instead it's the F word in EVERY single sentence and sometimes two or three times. I think the goal was to see how many times they could say it in one movie. Got to the scene that was pretty much pornographic and turned it off, that was about ten minutes into the movie. What a waste of money and two actors that I've always enjoyed. Sad that they resorted to this. In their defense, I should have looked up the rating of the movie and why."
1,Hate it.,I am very disappointed in this movie. It was just curse words for the first 15 minutes I watched. Way over the top. Old story about switching roles. It couldn't keep my attention.
3,review from the other one,"I thought that all of the characters in the book were potentially intresting and might have had ok personalities, but potential was all they had. Only the main character was really defined, and she in a predicatble way. The relationship between her and Greg should have been carried on. It was basically, she freaked and that was it. You'd think that might have some impact on her desision to accept herself, but it was just dropped. Also, the way she and Althea acted. While I can understand them being a little weird, considering one is a witch and the other a hawk, I'd say that it could be better developed. Great description though and the paralell between the way characters look and how they are is cool."
5,omg!!!!!!!!,"wow!!a great book for anyone!the ending is a bit confusing but i'll read it again to clarafy it!!please read this, and other work by jean, she is wonderfull, and i am going to be a life time reader!!i loooovvvvvvveeeeeeee her work, and so will you, start with this book and youll be hooked!!"
4,Excelent,"I loved this book. It was written well, and the characters where neat and alive. Aye it was predictible, but hey people always try to predict what they read anyway, so that gives those who want to predict it a chance~! Tis a well written book"
4,Gourmet baby basmati rice!,"Lotus Food specializes in heirloom rice from all over the world. This particular rice comes from Bangladesh. Kalijira, or gobindovog, is tiny--like a cumin seed when raw. In Bangladesh it is used only on holidays and special occasions, and is known as the Prince of Rice.Kalijira is very easy to cook. One cup raw makes 3 cups cooked. Following the package instructions it took exactly 25 minutes for 1 3/4 cups of water with one cup of rice to cook. Letting it sit for 5-10 minutes is a must to preserve the texture. The grains nearly double in size and are firm, not sticky. The fragrance is aromatic. The flavor is excellent, mild, barely nutty and with a faint hint of sweetness. It performed well served with a spicy stir fry. Kaljira is a versatile rice which would do well either in a dessert, such as a rice pudding or in a pilaf.Though this is an exotic rice, it is a solid contender for an all-around any meal rice to go with many different kinds of dishes. Enjoyable."
1,why in the world dont they give the actual colors??,"How am I supposed to know what color ""aphrodite"" is?? I hate that, at least put in perentheses, ""charcoal grey' or show a bigger swatch! I would like to try this eyeliner but since I have no idea what color the names represent, forget it..."
4,it fits what you would need to mail occasional letters.,Buy these if they are what you need. This box will last you along time. There are some nicer envelopes than these but it all depends on what you need/
3,Good Purchase!,I purchased this item because the price was right. I am almost out of envelopes already. I only wish they would sell more envelopes per package.
2,They don't stick,"The paper itself is fine, but the envelopes sticking ability is not good. I have to use tape to close the envelope I would not buy them again"
5,They do what they're supposed to,"It's hard to be too creative in reviewing envelopes. They hold my mail, the price was great, and they arrived the day after I ordered them!"
3,Not what I expected,"The sai themselves are decent quality. I got them as part of a costume, not to spar with, so I can't say how they would hold up in combat. They were much much heavier and longer than I expected."
4,"creative cookbook, good stuff","I bought this for my brother, a yoga teacher, and his fiance, a pilates instructor for Christmas. Since they fly in, I knew it had to be a small and light enough gift to bring on the plane. They loved this book. I was even tempted to photocopy some of the recipes before handing it over!"
2,Steamed broccoli is not a recipe,"I found the recipes in this book really basic, or odd. One of the recipes is for steamed broccoli, and another for steamed squash. I was hoping for some more interesting and innovative recipes than this. There is also a fairly limited selection of recipes for each body type - Im sure there are many more out there that could have been included."
4,Part of a whole life experience,This book really puts the harmony in eating. I'm not a vegetarian but I combine the pinciples of doshas to create everyday and seasonal meal plans. This book has makes eating part of a whole life experience.
3,Recommended with reservations,"Do not buy this book expecting to be able to use it for anything more than a reference to look up individual characters; it contains no compounds. It is not easy to use when looking up by pronunciation because the index includes no tones. The English definitions are not enough that you can use the word because it does not list whether or not the character is as bound morpheme, that is can it be used by itself or only with another character. In addition, it only gives traditional characters, but simplified characters are at least equally as important for any student of Chinese as a foreign language as the traditional ones. If I were comparing this book to other foreign language books in other languages I would not recomend it, but because of the shortage of Chinese language materials, and the price, it will probably be useful if you cannot afford as big character that would cost around $70."
1,Beware the misprints!,"The shop I work at had this book and it was a great reference. After years of use it fell apart and we had no problem buying another copy as it had be incredibly useful. The new copy we got is wrong. I don't mean that we found a few mistakes, this printing is WRONG. None of the stuff that we used in the old book line up correctly in the new version that we received. It's not like this is something that you can still use and it will just take long Imagine trying to look through a dictionary but none of it was in alphabetical order! I wish we still had the old copy that had fallen apart because at least that could be used even though it was in single page form by the end. So a word of caution, when you get this book, make sure everything lines up right!"
3,cool,"just because I love it. It's cool and clear about Chinese. If you want to know the Chinese, you must read it. I rcommand it to you."
5,useful guide,"It's a nicely laid-out book. Wish there was an audio accompaniment to these series that is packaged with the book. This book and also Understanding Chinese by the same author is, however, not for beginners. It serves as a good supplement."
3,No simplified characters,"I picked up this book to help me with my Mandarin studies. However, the book contains only tradition characters. If this book included both sets it would be priceless for learning to write. Another caveat, characters are only presented one at a time."
1,buy a Sony cassette adaptor.....,"I recently bought a Panasonic CD portable player with carkit for a road trip cross country. After 3 hours of using the cassette adapter, it stopped. I went to the closest circuit city and had them test it, and it didn't work there either. Since I didn't have my receipt, I bought a sony adapter which worked great and has ever since. The Panasonic people were no help and just sent me a generic e-mail. I recommend if you buy A Panasonic CD player, DON'T buy it with a car kit as an accessory. Use Sony, much more reliable and works just as well, despite what Panasonic tells you....."
1,Cannot Be Used With All Systems,From the Instructions for Installation:Car Stereo Cassette Adaptor; It can be used only for a car audio system with the head on the RIGHT. Cannot be used with these types: For a car audio system with the head on the left For a car audio system in which the head is in the center....
5,Panasonic RP-CK455 Adapter for Portable CD Player,The Panasonic RP-CK455 Adapter for Portable CD Player is just to good to be true. It just is A cd player that you would want to own. You just need to buy. The featues on the CD player are amazing.
1,worked great a couple of times,This is a nice looking rack pack but I had it since july and dont do much but ride around my 2 acres I had a (small) tool kit and extra rope in it and 8 months later all the straps broke off that held it to the quad but I guess for the price it I had a good run with it. Go for the more expensive one so this doesnt happen to you
2,The Global Underworld: A Good Primer,"The Global Underworld serves as a good introduction to the problem of transnational crime as it relates to the U.S. It lacks depth, however - it glosses over many topics, and relies primarily on secondary sources. If you are not a sociologist of deviance/criminologist, are not a U.S. citizen or resident, or are an undergraduate student, you'll probably find this book helpful. The book is easy enough to read, but not particularly exciting - it's an OK way to get your feet wet, but that's about it."
2,"Even at the price, you can go wrong","I'd have to disagree with the opinion that the price justifies the quality of these towels. A low quality value isn't a value.I won't be returning them, as it would cost me more than *keeping* them. (That, as it was part of a get twenty-five off one-twenty-five incentive in kitchen and housewares, with the discount void if you return anything.) They'll probably give me a good 3 to 6 months before I have to relegate them to the ""towels for protecting skin from hair dye and other industrial uses"" pile, which is anything but my usual experience with the Martex brand. I'm surprised they'd put their name and their reputation on towels that lose loops and run just with the pressure of (carefully) removing the inspection tag. (Maybe trying to remove the tag should be part of that inspection!)"
4,Palm TX PDA Stylus,These seem to be of good quality and I like the fact that they serve as both a stylus (as is) and a ballpoint pen (tip removed).
4,Joe PDA,The product is everything I thought it would be and was an easy purchase. Everything went well with this purchase I am very satisfied.
5,christmas present for granddaughter,great classic book for christmas. i have bought this book before for some of my other grandchildren and they all have enjoyed it.
1,A Nata Do Braga,Crap.....I expected something very different. I went by a list of music from another company. I can't even give this away
1,Hysteria,"If you want to know all about all sorts of terrible things that will kill you, everyone you know and end civilization as we know it, read this book!You'll be scared and worried and yet you will be powerless to do anything.Complete waste of time."
1,Very dissapointed.,I thought I was buying silicone gel strips like I had bought from my plastic surgeon. These were more like paper not silicone.
3,Un poco repetitivo,"LAs primeras 100 páginas de este libro de relatos son valiosas, después comienzan las repeticiones sin cese del mismo tema.Sin embargo, estas primeras 100 páginas son de una tal calidad que bien vale leer esta colección de artículos.Imprescindible para periodistas."
5,Great for creating outstanding scenery,Having trouble with that woodland scenery? Is your metropolis going crooked with the horizon? Then this book shows the easy tricks of the Manga world to get you going on the right track and in no time you'll be amazed at how easy it is to create those effects that manga fans drool over on the screen!
5,Good quality. Work just fine.,"I haven't used them all yet, but all I've tried have worked perfectly and look nice. I'm using them for scrapbooking projects."
5,Great price!,"If you are a scrapbooker, or mixed-media artist who uses book rings, these are a great value ... especially when compared to what you will pay for them in an art, craft, or scrapbook store. These have worked great for the projects I purchased them for. The box is a little flimsy, but that wasn't an issue for me since I repackage most of my materials anyway."
2,Not the right size.,"This is not 1 inch, it is bigger. It is super sturdy and very good, but it is labelled wrong as far as I can measure, but it is a good product."
3,"Alright for the price, I guess.","The box I received only contained 94 rings instead the 100 stated on the box. The rings are lower quality (thinner and don't snap together as well) than other binder rings I have bought. The metal rubs off on your fingers from handling. Overall, they do their job for the most part and were cheap enough ($9) that I'm not too upset by the quality or missing rings."
3,Purely a binder type ring.,"From the description of ""Heavy Duty"" Nickel plated I thought the rings would be strong enough to use for my patented invention. Unfortunately thay are strong for paper and conventional ring use but not strong enough for my needs. They are not made to be opened and closed a couple of times and still stay tightly latched."
3,Best-Loved Negro Spirituals Complete Lyrics to 178 Songs,"As someone who is learning to play the piano, Nicole and Ronald Herder's compilation, Best-Loved Negro Spirituals Complete Lyrics to 178 Songs of Faith : Complete Lyrics to 178 Songs of Faith, was purchased with the expectation this volume would include both lyrics and musical arrangements. Without some type of musical accompaniment(cassette, CD, scores), having the lyrics is not very beneficial if one doesn't already know how the songs should be sung. The hope was that ""Best Loved"" would be more like the Gwendolyn Sims book, Ev'ry Time I Feel the Spirit, meaning: history, lyrics, and arrangements. ""Best Loved"" is more like a book of gospel poetry and was not returned for that reason. Perhaps I will happen-upon recordings or sheet music or other arrangements for some of the older, non-standards."
3,Truly Subversive Music,"This is the definition of ""challenging music"" that makes serious demands on the listener. This is very uncommercial music, so much so that it makes the Velvet Underground (her former band) sound like Elton John. This is Nico wandering around the frozen tundra looking for roses in the snow. It is drug music, specifically, Heroin music. Is it any good? Yes, it is. John Cale makes sure it is. Between his production, piano, viola, guitar etc., he builds Nico a musical cathedral in which she can bemoan her lamentations to her hearts content. In some alternative universe, this probably outsold Michael Jackson's Thriller and won more Grammy's, but the question is , would we want to live in this alternative universe? Listen to these 2 discs before you answer that seemingly obvious question. R.I.P Nico."
4,J Geils music,This cd doesn't have as many recognizable songs on it as freeze frame but Comeback & Love Stinks are well worth the purchase in my opinion.
4,J. Geils Band - Classic Geils,"Personally, I've always thought J. Geils was under rated. Because I tend to drone on, I'll keep this short. This 'Album' has all the diversity of a classic J.Geils cuts. Remember, some albums tell a story, a some don't. But they all tell about the artist in some way shape or form. This classic is no different. A must have for any fan of rock. (Yeah, I had it in vinyl, so what?) ;-)"
4,Classic from the past!,"Loved this when I was growing up. It does border on Disco on a couple of songs, but includes the classic love song ""Love Stinks"". A must have in the J Geils library."
4,Upbeat and Focused,This is good honest rock n roll music with a lot a bounce and pizazz. Peter Wolf sings with alot of style and emotion while the band lays down all the right riffs. Not quite a clasic but there are enough good songs to make a worthwhile listen every so often.
4,Comfort music that won't disappoint,"This was released right before they completely busted out into the mainstream with Freeze Frame. As a whole, this is a great release, not a lot of strong songs, but all songs are very listenable...you won't find yourself skipping through the songs as you listen to this. Overall, a must for any collection."
3,May not work with all binding machines,"These are the greatest small binders for marketing books that are only a few pages. However, they are so small that they are extremely difficult to use in certain binding machines (mostly older ones I've found.) They seem to work great in newer models."
5,Great value,You get a ton of binders for cheap so you really can't go wrong. There's nothing much more to say.
3,Annoying!,"Great price, and these make neat compact booklets BUT they're fiddly to work with - using with my GBC CombBind C50 these combs spring out of the binder before I can open them sufficiently to insert the pages. Will buy slightly bigger size next time."
3,"Ingenious murder, plodding dialogue","This is strictly for cerebral mystery fans who can live without setting, atmosphere and dialogue as long as the mystery is sufficiently ambiguous. There are red herrings aplenty, including a spurious digression about wife-swapping and lots of genealogy that goes nowhere. Even the many chapters spent peeling away the layers of knowledge about the first murder victim turn out to be totally irrelevant to the resolution, which comes out of left field. An unknown mystery tenant who turns out to be very important -- you won't know anything about the person's existence until the inspector and the investigator sit down to explain it all to us folks. I prefer my mystery books to give me a fighting chance to figure it all out."
5,Probably the best source of Domino reference material around,"Great book, I would look it up at least once day. Having said that, the chapter on Java is a waste of space, and appears to have been added in a hurry. Otherwise this is the best one around (until they bring out a version for Domino 4.6 ?)"
5,Brilliant book.,"I, of course, have no way of verifying the information in this book. The information seems very convincing to me. As such, I consider this to be one of the most powerful and informative books I have ever read about spiritual wisdom. It tells a very plausible story about Anna, the grandmother of Jesus, about the whole supporting cast that appeared to support Jesus' ministry and the incredible history of his times. As a spiritual writer myself, I congratulate the author for the beauty and clarity of the writing and enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the incredible contribution Jesus, Anna and the other characters in this book have made to mankind's spiritual evolution."
3,"Anna, Grandmother of Jesus","Mixed reaction - - some reasonable information, but questionable scholarship. I get the impression that the author is promoting personal beliefs a bit beyond actual factual material."
1,No stars - or only one because I'm pushed to enter something,"I found this to be a badly written book and, as such, difficult to read. The story itself is quite interesting though it's hard to know how much is complete fiction and how much of it is taken from Cayce readings."
2,File Under Fiction???,"I purchased this book as Christmas approached, hoping to gain more insights into Anna and her remarkable life. The ""Cayce Readings"" have great information, also I would highly recommend ""Life of Jesus Christ & Biblical Revalations"" by the Anne Catherine Emmerich which has endless insights into the life of St. Anne. Even the ""Lost Books of The Bible"" offers better insights. This book seems like a Dan Brown novel, fictional history. Contradicting much of the Information already sourced through Emmerich & Cayce it left Me with an empty feeling, not full of knowledge.In My opinion, without being all knowing, this is a work of fiction. New Age/Metaphysical is about a more perfect understanding, not a more stimulating story."
3,I Didn't Get It??,"Ok, I'm a pretty well-read person, but this book really just confused me! I guess I didn't see that ""multidimensional"" or ""cellular rejuvination"" or entering other people's ""souls."" It was very hard to follow, and it could have been written WAY more simply. I felt like I had to keep referencing a dictionary just to get through a chapter.It was interesting how the author set up St. Anna to actually speak to YOU in the book.If you are looking for a historical fiction on the life of St. Anna the Grandmother of Jesus, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a more spiritual, mysrical, and philosophical writing on the life and times of Jesus, this may be the book for you."
5,I Felt and Sense real Energy from the book,It was remarkable the Energy and the feelings that I sense from the begining till the end... Well there is no end... because that is the message. The Energy from the Divine Mother is so strong that I felt her in every words.That is why I recomend this book
2,"Shouldn't have been ""Good""","There were far too many markings in this book for it to be considered ""good"". Many pages had top to bottom highlighting with only a few words left white."
4,L5 - First City in Space,I first saw L5 at the IMAX in 3D. It is set in the late 21st century and is seen through the eyes of a young girl who has always lived in the city in space. She has never been to earth except in a virtual sense. It is interesting in that the scenario is quite possible and shows most of the technologies we might expect to see in a space city. The story centres around the need to find more water and maintain the supply indefinitely. It is like a documentary with a bit of drama.
3,L5 - First City in Space (IMAX) - Poor,"L5 - First City in Space (IMAX) was a poor film rating only 2 to 3 stars with this reviewer. The graphics, music, acting and basic story were very poor and I felt like I was watching a made for TV movie for children. I am very glad my wife was able to talk me out of seeing this one when I noticed it playing at the IMAX in our mall."
2,Meant for young kids...,"First, this was a IMAX film, so the transfer to the small screen seems to have hurt it. The special effects and 3-D images don't look at all realistic on a TV screen and many times some of the voices seemed to get sucked away, so sometimes I can't hear what somebody is saying. Add the weak story, the wooden acting, the fact that there is no real sense of danger and you have something that should really be only one star. Even for the 22nd Century some of the technology seems too far out and unexplained. KIDS may enjoy it but even they may not find it as interesting as they may find the extra to the disc the anime short 'Journey To The Planets'. For a film from 1996, this is really pretty bad.If you want something about living and working in space may I suggest 'Living And Working In Space: The Countdown Has Begun' if you can find it. It has Jaime Escalante, Weird Al Yankovic, Billy Bob Thornton, and Jesse Ventura!"
4,L5 First city in Space,"The first feature on the disc, 'L5 City in Space' is like Star Trek for second graders. There is danger, but it is not as threatening as something that would destroy the entire colony. In fact, the scariest part is like the end of Apollo 13, when there is a fear that the father may be lost when he doesn't radio back immediately after a crucial part of his mission.The other feature is a short film about an alien ark exploring our Solar System. Due to our rapid progress in our explorations, the film is somewhat dated. The ship appears to be huge to its crew members, but there is a 'surprise' twist at the end which can be easily guessed by anyone who has ever looked at a drop of pond water under a microscope."
3,L5-First City in Space,The producers should have decided to make a sci-fi feature or a documentary about the prospects of living in space. It was entertaining although I was curious about why they needed to send someone out to repair the probe when they already showed they have the robotic technology to build a whole colony? Plus the need for additional water on L5 demonstrates poor management of resources so how is it better than living on Earth. Earth is our home if we take good care of it. There is no reason to have space stations with large numbers of people orbiting the Earth. Best when shown with a digital projector on a large screen.
1,juvenile,"Although efforts were made to produce this, it should have clearly been stated by marketing that this was for children 12y and under. As adult and scientist i was not amused being sold to (duped) in this fashion.Amazon's selection engine based on mutual interests needs finetuning!"
4,"Read it for ""A Love Child""","I almost rated this book ""5 stars"" in spite of the fact that the first novella (""The Grandmothers"") is almost unreadable, because ""A Love Child"" is one of the most moving and beautifully-written things I have ever read. I almost missed it because after I read ""The Grandmothers"" I nearly put the book away in disappointment.Buy the book, read ""Victoria and the Staveleys"" and treat yourself to ""A Love Child""."
5,"ideas, ideas, great writing, and more ideas...opens the mind and heart","I had been away from Doris Lessing too long;I had fogotten too much, even or especially about myself. You can read the plot summaries in the other reviews. I'll not repeat them and I didn't get past line 2 of SCI-Fi one...never do. Oh but the others...who has the grace of love? a generous heart? needs? mistakes, consequences...all in prose that seems efortless but is not.a lovely, lovely treat"
4,Instructive first-hand journal of author in early Alz.,"Sad and at times surprising story of author as she enters the first stage(s) of Alzheimer's disease. A quick read, yet quite informative"
1,andrew lloyd webber cd,"This was not the cd I ordered. I have have been busy with Christmas, new year and a divorce to contact you. The cd is just sitting here unplayed."
4,"Okay, but not as good as The Descent","I thought that this book was a pretty good adventure. The characters were interesting, the plot was cool, and all in all it was a pretty cool novel. His later book ""The Descent"" was far, far better, of course, but this one was pretty good."
5,"Clear, straight to the point, essential meditation book","This book is a must read if you are interested in the most simple, yet very challenging and profound, meditation techniques. I have had a good fortune to meet a living teacher, who has taught on the very same subject, but this book accompanies and wraps those teachings perfectly. Roaring Silence provides the stepping stones to start the journey into your very own mind and to the whole phenomenal universe that's dancing in front of our noses, all the time."
5,I'm indebted for your help.,"This book offered me not only a path toward meditation practice, but a personal guide to help me along the way. Its author seemed to step out from the pages -- to recognize and understand the experiences I'd encounter, and to reach out a hand as guide and encouragement. I could meditate in a room by myself, but I was no longer alone. I am indebted to Ngakpa Chogyam. Highly recommended!"
5,Roaringly great book,"This is the best book I've seen/read on the art of meditation. It gives someone who is a complete beginner all of the basics while also providing the flavor of complete path. As someone who has been meditating for nearly 20 years I still consider myself a beginner in most ways. Ngakpa Chogyam paints the picture of the practice so that depending on who is reading/viewing it, they will see what they are ready to see. A beginner will learn the basics with a flavor of where the practice leads. The seasoned meditator may get a stronger sense of the view of the Dzogchen path while at the same time refurbishing the foundation of their practice."
5,Can Anyone Say Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar?,"Franklin White has always shown that us that he can give the good, the bad, and the ugly of relationships with engaging dialogue and realistic settings but now he has brought a new flavor to the urban thriller. White can do it all! This is the kind of book that will have you talking out loud to the characters, anxious to turn the page and will wake you up in the middle of the night worrying about what will happen next. I won't give away the plot but let's just say people will do anything and everything for that money!"
1,Ducane Grill Cover,"I returned the Grill Cover, but have not seen a credit on my credit card.The information on the web site was not sufficient - in that it didn't indicated all the grills it would work with, so the grill cover size I needed - this one did not fit.So, I had to incurr $$$ for something that was an omission on the description.When can I expect my credit?Thanks.David Caccamo"
4,Tight,The fit on my 4200 is tighter than it has to be. The 4 corners of this grill have sharp corners that feel like they want to rip the cover over time. Weber grill have large radiused corners.
2,poor quality,"It fits but its of poor quality, I don't expect it to last long. my previous Ducane cover: 20171501, was at least 3X better quality, wish they still made them like this."
1,Barely 6 months old,"Thought it might last more than 6 months, all 4 corners are ripped through. It seemed too snug when I first put it on, it just wasn't made to last."
1,Broke within a year,"Not made for outdoor (!?). It fit tightly at first but within the first winter, cracks appeared and it became useless unless I duck tape it. I bought a larger cover at Walmart and it is still holding well after more than a year. This product is not Ducane-quality."
2,Doesn't Last,"Extremely disappointed! The cover ripped in the corner after only 6 weeks. It does not hold up to the weather at all. We've had it now for about 9 months and it is falling apart. We will definitely have to replace it this summer. It was too late to return it, and we feel totally ripped off. We didn't expect it to last forever, but it didn't even make it thru one BBQ season."
2,Average Sifter-if looking for high end one keep looking.,Your basic sifter. I like the turn handle models a lot better than the squeeze handle ones. This one is somewhat flimsy. The handle is attached with a cheap bolt and nut that comes off easily so check the handle often and tighten as needed. Mine came off when I was sifting flour into a bowl and the nut fell into my ingredients.The bolt and nut also rust so make sure you dry it thoroughly. I replaced the bolt and nut with ones that are rust proof and sturdier; used a locking nut so it would stay on better. Required a trip to the hardware store but given the price I can't really complain. You get what you pay for.
1,Incorrect package advertising,Supplier promised to remove this product from shelf as the packaging had incorrect information on it.
5,Best Beast movie ive seen,"I saw this movie on dvd at sams club and I just had to have it. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite story. Since I got it Ive watched it over ten times a day. I just went and saw disney's Beauty and the Beast on broadway and it was nothing compared to the costumes, senery, music, and songs that are in this movie. I promise you that all people of all ages will fall in love with the beast just as I did when I was three and a half."
2,What is ENCYCLOPEDIA ?,"This is a useful book only for young students and ignorant people on classical mythology. I was deeply disappointed when I received this book,since I expected a comprehensive encyclopedia about Greek & Roman myths .However the book does not contain Greek alphabet spelling of any Greek proper noun , any source of each item/entry and even genealogical trees . Who can name such an elementay book ""Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology"" on earth ? I wonder for whom this book was written ? If it was written for children , the author should have inserted pictures or illustrations. And if it was written for common readers , the author should have surpassed at least Michael Grant's ""Who's Who in Classical Mythology"" . Only one thing that some place-names are included is the good characteristics of the book. Anyway I did not buy it , if I knew the poverty of its contents."

1,You May Be Smarter Than The Author!,"I am a mind/concept/idea mapper. I acknowledge the contribution Mr. Buzan has made to promoting ""mind maps"" as an important and powerful learning and communications tool.HEAD FIRST is a multi-million copy bestseller, so apparently pure fluff is in demand. HEAD FIRST is chock full of gee-whiz moments and ""Did You Know?"" tidbits for which (the paperback 2003 edition at least) has no citations. While pop-pulp readers may be quite comfortable digesting uncited material, HEAD FIRST just gets some things wrong: GALILEO was the first to see the moons of Jupiter, not DaVinci.DID YOU KNOW? that tidbits without citations may well end up making you look like an idiot even if you are smarter than you think?The purchase of HEAD FIRST will be money well-spent if you're in need of a mental pep talk. But buyer beware if you're expecting cognitive science."
4,Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Genetics,"an excellent way to prepare for exams in Genetics, BICD 100 @ ucsd. I highly recommend this book."
2,Nice concept but not worth the price,"Bought a pair, they look good from a distance but build quality screams CHEAP (rough edges, very light, keeps moving around the bed-stand, tough to clean, the top pops out very easily).I have had them for about 3 years and keep planning to throw them out and replace with something more nicely-made."
5,Don't let the colorization bother you,"I hate colorization, but I think this is a great DVD. The reason is that it actually contains pristine and fully restored color AND black and white versions of the 4 public domain Stooge shorts every second-rate DVD company has released using horrible looking source elements (including Anchor Bay, whose ""Greatest Hits and Rarities"" is a disgrace for a company of their stature). If you are looking to pick up the 4 public domain Stooge titles -- Disorder in the Court (Curly), Malice in the Palace (Shemp), Sing a Song of Six Pants (Shemp) and Brideless Groom (Shemp) -- this is the definitive version."
3,Bought it for the Film Crew,"I don't care for the pedestrian antics of the Stooges. If you're a fan that's cool, but I've never liked their slapstick violence in the least.I purchased this for the Film Crew, and they got me laughing. The Shep skit is merciless and hillarious, but it'll make Stooge fans cry. The Moe skit was a kick as well. The problem is, there's not enough of these bits, so it's really not worth the money."
2,Same old Public Domain stuff already restored on SONY DVDs !,"Beware, this is the same old 4 public domain Stooges titles that appear on dozens of PD videos & DVDs.The real RESTORED copies are on the SONY Three Stooges DVDs in their original glorious B&W.;And who is the Jack White (II) credited as dierctor? The director of colorization? Jules White was the director of most SHEMP shorts."
3,Gets old after track 13,"Wow... i dunno what to say. I love Fear Factory, i think they are one of the best bands from th 90's. But i dont know about this album. After track 13, it becomes annoying. its nuttn but noise! Like, the video game songs in the beginning are okay, nowhere near as good as the stuff on their albums. The remixes, for the most part, were kool enough for a few listens. This is an easy throwaway, and certainly for diehard fans only. One of those cds that u must own to complete your collection."
4,Enclosed booklet makes this disc worth every penny,The absolute best thing about this album is the cd booklet which describes why each of these tracks were included on this album and what makes them unique. A definite must-have for any Fear Factory fan!
2,WTF? boooooo!,"Im going to start off by saying that I have been a dedicated FF fan for many years and I own all of their albums and most of the singles. I dont know if they were contractually obligated but this ""album"" is just a bunch of stuff thrown together as an attempt from Roadrunner Records at making some money. Any hardcore FF fan would already have most of the tracks, and anyone not familiar with them should buy Demanufacture. Pfff....this whole thing just disgusts me. I felt that I had to give them 2 stars because they are Fear Factory. [...]"
4,FOR GROWN-UPS ONLY......,"PHIL PERRY IS SO UNDERRATED! HIS VOCALS ARE BOTH SMOOTH & HAUNTING ALL AT ONE TIME. HIS COVER OF ARETHA FRANKLIN'S ""CALL ME"" IS ONE OF THE BEST REMAKES I HAVE EVER HEARD! ""FOREVER"" GOT SOME SPINS ON THE RADIO, BUT THE ALBUM STEALER HERE IS ""WOMAN"". WHAT A TRACK! YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO THE RANGES THAT HE TAKES THAT SONG! YOU CAN FEEL THE PAIN & LOVE IN THE VOCALS. A MUST BUY FOR MATURE MUSIC LOVERS....."
3,LJL,"This CD was ok, but I thought it would be better - there is only one Hit Song ""Call Me"" on this CD. But after I just listen to all the songs I started to be okay with the hold CD."
3,Full season dvd not great,"I love this show, but I bought the full season new from Amazon. Season 4 dvd was fine until last disk, United Nation and the first baby part 1....dvd was bad and couldn't watch all of United Nation, and none of baby part 1..the dvd was flawed, and just froze up....could not get it to move.....very disappointed, considering all seasons up till 4 had been great..."
4,Satisfied,Product came in good condition. There was a little damage to the plastic wrap that it was in but the product is working fine.
2,Late and flawed,It took four weeks for the DVD set to arrive.then one of the disks in the set did not workthis was a birthday gift for a niece. Of course it arrived a week after the big date.
5,Very good season...,"I would rate this season about even with season three, which makes it excellent! The townfolk are changing even more, as are Michela and Sully, who are now a married couple. This season, like season three, also has some very memorable episodes and it is definitely worth buying and watching over and over again!"
5,Welcome to the Jungle~,"And you are going to enjoy it! I had the opportunity to see this film at the IMAX theater and it was spectacular, I look forward to seeing it on dvd now that it has been released. It combines a sensational visual experience with the interconnected stories of Mark Plotkin, an ethnobotanist, and a fictional shaman. Both are in search of healing plants in the Amazon. Mark Plotkin also wrote Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice, and this movie is a really nice add-on if you've already enjoyed his book."
3,too short,"the music is good, the film is very interesting with both animals and peoples but we don't see enough animals in the deepjungle,the high definition is very succesful with wonderful colors but it could have been used more for our pleasure"
3,"good nature film, great for family viewing.","Enjoyed the scenery in this movie, and was glad I purchased it. Very informative about how we are destroying the coral reefs, and how global warming is affecting the reefs."
2,"All very clear, controlled, British and sort of","The words are there, the songs are sung, the diction clear, the last row will hear but there is nothing much dangerous or New York grit in this one.I imagine this is how the English must think we do Oscar Wilde or Congreve or, God forbid, CATS!. It's all there but just wrong."
3,I really wanted to love it...,"This was one of the first things I got for my baby and I was so excited to try it out. No, it isn't hard to get on, but it is just sooo long to deal with and once baby is in it for an extended period of time, it eventually sags so low that it needs to be re-adusted. It also got very twisted as I put it on. I was hoping this would work out for me, but the Baby Bjorn has been much easier to use."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this carrier after reading all the good reviews. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. It's easy to wear and wrap around your body. But it's inconvenient to get baby in and out of it. I breastfeed so I have to take my baby out of it for burping. When I take him out, the fit of the wrap has changed so I'd have to take it off and re-wrap myself again. There's also the issue of the fabric dangling on the floor while you set it up. Just too much of a hassle for me. It does look stylish though."
4,Great for us city gals,This carrier works for this city gal. I do a ton of walking and I do find that this carrier gets hot in the summer but overall it's the best way to bring my son with me.
5,love this!,"This carrier is as close to perfect as one can get. It works better than a sling because my baby is in there securely, and can face in or out, be on my hip, or, best yet, hands free nursing! It's better than the Snugli/Bjorn carriers because he's right against me versus having fabric and plastic between us and it distributes his weight much better than these types of carriers. The head support on this carrier is better, too, since it conforms to the baby versus the head flopping forward.It does take a few times putting on to get used to, but after a week of use, it's VERY EASY (watch the video). I'll use it a lot when shopping and around the house. It was also GREAT when flying as it's small enough to fit in the diaper bag. I've washed and dried mine in the machines in a pinch with no problems. It's no more hot than the other carriers."
2,It doesn't work for me,"The material is stretchy, so my baby tends to slide down after he's in it for 10 minutes or so. Then, he's not happy because it's not comfortable any more, and he starts to fuss. Then it gets really hot when he fusses. Then I have to take him out and calm him. After taking him out, the fabric and the knot is all screwed up, so I have to re-tie the sling. It just doesn't work. I agree that there's no head support for the newborn."
3,Time and Patience Required,"I'm sure this is a great product. But I already have 2 yr. old, and I got this to use on my newborn. I don't have time for the wrapping and unwrapping this thing requires. Nor the patience. I'm only human.Oh and if you get this for someone's shower, they will only have 30 days to return it if you order it online."
2,Its PR for the Toughlove program,"Lots of stories of badly behaving children and bewildered parents. Objective appears to be to tell parents about how to start or find a toughlove group. Slightly helpful in that it promotes involving your friends, family and community to hold your child accountable."
1,It condones child abuse,"Lies, lies, lies. I know of a case where a woman who is a total and utter verbal abuser, wealthy, has convinced her support group that SHE is the victim. She is a total victimizer. Her children are straight A students, no drugs, clean rooms, no trouble with authorities. But the trouble is her abusiveness...anyhow...the groups claim to not support physical and verbal abusiveness on the part of parents, but none of that has changed with this woman....Never does this book talk about child abuse. Never does it address that end of the coin. It never deals with educational neglect, other sorts of neglect on the part of parents. John Holt, a ten times better writer, parent, educator, PERSON that the folks that got this book ghost written (couldnt even write it themselves), said ""THERE ARE NO PROBLEM CHILDREN WITHOUT PROBLEM PARENTS."""
3,Some good advice,"Although this book does offer some great advice for taking back control of your children's lives, and your own...it's mostly a companion book for people also attending the Toughlove meetings. It's more about the Toughlove network/program, itself, than a teaching tool/self-help/advice kind of book.Since there are no meetings in my area, I thought the book would offer me what I couldn't get at the meetings. Not so much. Which is fine, I get the fact that the networking is a vital part of it all. Just wish I knew that before buying it :) Because pretty much everything in the book depends on your getting to those meetings and building a network.If you can get to the meetings, this is a good book to have. If not, this book doesn't really stand on it's own."
4,Terry-Thomas makes WHO sexy!,"Who would have thought being a germ detective could be so provocative? Terry-Thomas plays a charming infectious disease investigator for the World Health Organization based in London. Women love his flirty suggestive manner and even a chimp is attracted to him. He can't help gazing at a lovely pair of legs, even putting his unique sports car at risk. One gem in this surprise is Honor Blackman who plays the airport nurse. She hasn't yet developped her persona as a Bond girl but the voice is there. I gave this a 4 because during the beginning there is an annoying film stamp, SC, in the middle of the screen. I suppose it is there to stop piracy but it is distracting. It eventually disappears. If you are a TT fan, you may want to see this one. It is not uproarious but it is funny."
2,Satisfactory,Not a bad beginner guide to Access. A bit lacking in the discussion of moderately more sophisticated functions such as building security and understanding the compatibility of Access databases between different versions of Access.
4,Good Book,"I like the 24 hour format of the ""Sams"" books. I did teach myself Access (from scratch) in 24 hours with this book. It's a good book."
1,This is a lousy book,"I was really disappointed with this book. (I wish there was a zero stars option.) They spend time telling you basic Windows things like that the X is the Window close button, but don't give you the menu path for functions they tell you about... Very frustrating and terrible."
1,A Teribble Book,"I rarely take the time to review a book. However, this one was so bad, I had to warn everybody who is thinking about buying it. I read many computer books, but this one is confusing, and never gets to the point."
4,Spider-Man does it again.,"This book is a great collection of Peter Parker issues from the 70's. Awesome stuff! 1976-9 collecting 'Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man' issues 1-31. Spider-Man faces some long forgotten foes such as- Tarantula, Lightmaster, Hitman, and Hate Monger. With guest-stars such as the Fantastic Four, Razorback, Black Bolt, and Daredevil. 18 issues penciled by Sal Buscema. And one of my favorite artists Jim Mooney and two issues penciled by the legendary Frank Miller! Also a bonus appearance by X-men writer Chris Claremont. An excellent addition to any comic book fans collection. All interior pages are black and white which are an excellent resource of reference for aspiring pencilers and inkers."
1,Disappointed,"The original Pears soap was made in the UK, this soap is a product of India. Even though it is advertised as the original, it is not, and I an very disappointed."
4,Green Tea,"I got this so long ago that I can't remember for sure, but must have been okay as I now have a new supply from you on hand!"
5,nice but only complete edition,"not so good, but if you are a true Guns n Roses Fans...this video help you to know more about it...just have fun with it.."
3,Guns N' Roses DVD Collector's Box,"Not What I Expected at all. Just 2 Unauthorised DVDs from UK. One of which I Already own. The Other, I have Already Seen and Chose Not to Purchase. No GN'R Music. Contains... Axl Rose, The Prettiest Star. And. Sex, Drugs and Rock N' Roll. Disappointing."
1,"Poorly Researched, but pretty","The book itself is pretty, but poorly researched, with errors a plenty and a style that doesn't work with the topic.The works of Paul Cerruzzi, Michael Williams or Bill Asprey are much better as an introduction to the concepts, and have at least a bit of accuracy when it comes to the material."
3,Fun for reminiscing,"I first started working on both mainframes and personal computers in the 1970s, and have worked on a wide variety of machines.The book has a number of errors, but is a wonderful buy for those of us who grew up with computers. It generally follows the right flow of creation, but is so superficial that there are errors. Those people looking to learn about the history of computers should avoid this. However, those of you looking to take a walk down memory lane will love the book and its pictures.If you know the real stories, the pictures bring back lots of fun memories. If you don't know the real story, get some other books, you won't understand the pictures and the text isn't good enough."
5,Great book for collecting,"Don't expect much knowledge from this book, but it brilliantly shows the history of computers just through pictures. I love it!"
4,Good Quality Standard D-Ring Binder,Ten years ago most three-ring binders sold in the U.S. (at least in the Midwest) were made in the United States -- not so today. The quality of these Samsill three-ring binders is as good but mostly better than that of their imported competitors. If you can get them at a good price then please do so.
1,Vimy review,"Vimy by Berton is a fabulous book on the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. Lots of fascinating, personal stories of the men who fought and died, and great insight to the suffering that they endured."
4,Critical thinking applied to this program,"Very interesting and informative.However, panelists concur in simplistically using what Roger Sperry has termed ""bottom-up causation (neurology) to the neglect of ""top-down causation"" from cultural, familial, societal forces. The program fails to present critical analyses of the statements and theories by the panelists, nor does it present much about psychological and cultural interventions other than some vague references to psychotherapy. There is a growing body of research on non-medical theories and interventions."
1,Nude Students,"Cheaply made, deceiving description. The video is all in slow motion. There is only one very edited scene.Very un-happy. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO."
3,O.K.,"This book was okay. Brad Steiger isn't my favorite author, and a lot of his books are from the 70's."
5,Great Buy,I was looking for some horses to give my daughter for her 4th birthday and these were a great deal for the price. I saw other toy horses that were just hollow plastic for almost twice as much and these have a nice soft coat. She loves them!
1,Find a sturdier set!,"My daughter received this as a gift and instantly fell in love with it. The saddles do not stay fastened which is frustrating. In less than 24 hours, one of the foal's legs broke and one the horse's tails came out. We returned the set to the store.This is definitely not what I would expect from a Melissa and Doug toy."
3,The hooves need help,"My daughter loves these horses. Wish they came with a barn or something. After having made them trot all over the floor of my house, the hooves are almost stripped! Not the greatest quality in that regard, but my daughter has not noticed this:-)"
2,Tail fell out!!!!!!!,"My daughter got these for Christmas from her grandparents. She is 3 years old and a horse FANATIC. These horses are cute (although I struggle to understand why they made the baby horse look so silly with the way it is standing. I know it's supposed to be 'learning to walk' but it just looks goofy to me.)Anyways, within the first few hours of my daughter having them, the tail on the adult brown horse came out of it! It took a lot of finesse but I was able to get it back in.... all for it to come out again a few days later at home. My daughter is 3 so she can be a little rough with toys but it's not anymore than usual I would think and I would expect something targeted towards kids her age would be a little more durable. She still plays with them but every time she picks up the brown horse, she reminds me that it's 'broken'. LOL.So overall, they are cute but they could have held up a little bit better for my taste."
3,"Excellent test questions, average module outlines.",I find the test questions and explainations after each module are authentic and very helpful in understanding the concepts. However the module outlines are not so well written. I wonder if other buyers have same feeling.
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this as a bonus when I purchased an Aiptek camera. This thing truly is a piece of garbage. The clarity of the audio is horrible. It seems like it is pushing way too much power through a tiny speaker. It sounded broken straight out of the box. The dock on top is useless, because it offers no way to charge your camera. It has a small lead-in, where you can feed the power adapter from your own charging cable, but it is really just a big hassle. I haven't touched it since I first tried it, and I would have returned it if I didn't get it for free. I don't even think it deserves a single star."
1,What a gimick! Totally useless,"I bought these, based on the specs (claim to go down to 15Hz). The vibrating thing might fool you into thinking there's some thumping bass behind your head, but the overall response of the speakers is nowhere near that good. It's like the mid-range is barely audible, and aside from the bass you would normally feel instead of hear, you don't really hear any bass at all. After wearing these things for half an hour, I had a headache. I wouldn't buy a pair like this without a good test-run first."
2,Neat Idea,"These headphones are a great idea but they made me feel like I was going to vomit. Seriously! If you are prone to motion sickness I don't think these are for you, unless you carry barf bags around with you."
2,one size does not fit all..,this product while sometimes providing the bass vibrating on ones neck. thats if your neck is small or med.. in my case the earpods barely fit into my ear canal and that limits the sound im able to hear..the sound if you could hear might be ok.. but i wouldnt know...
1,WORST HEADPHONES EVER,"These headphones bang into your head with the music... I guess that might be cool, but the sound fades in and out and you look like a moron with headphones banging into your head. You can turn off the ""brain shaking"" feature, but the sound quality is still poor and they are really, really uncomfortable."
4,The second Collingswood heirs book,"This is the second (and I think last) book in the series. Definitely a good read, but fast. The romance was sweet and the mystery decent, but I had it figured out long before it was over.There were some real dilemmas in the book, but of course it wrapped up happily. Almost too happily. I would have liked an epilogue but I would recommend it. Make sure to read the first one!"
3,Armenian Wisdom,"This book is the best collection of proverbs about one of the oldest cultures in the history of the world. Read what many famous Armenians had to say about their people. Read what many of the world's leaders, historians, travellers, etc. have discovered about the Armenians. Want to know what President Clinton, Adolf Hitler, or other influencial people think about the Armenians? Then read ""Armenian Wisdom."" It is the greatest collection of what people think of Armenians."
5,Just Time Well Spent,"This book strikes a nice balance - it is a useful reference book, while remaining interesting and entertaining. It takes a practical and innovative approach to addressing the usually stiff topic of math. I can't recall another math book I would characterize as ""fun"" - and you know how engineers could use more fun in our lives!!! It is an excellent refresher on math topics, and an enjoyable read. The included CD-ROM is a nice bonus."
4,ok shoes,these shoes are by no means as good as my dockers but they've stood the test of time and that says alot coming from me...
3,What can i say - it works!,"What can i say - it works! Sorry for the redundancy, but it's true! Strong bristles, firm handle. Maybe there are cheaper ones; can't remember why I chose this one. But I'm very pleased! Maybe if it cleaned my wheels FOR me while I sat on the porch drinking lemonade then it would easily receive 5 stars. But it doesn't. So 3 (average) is where I'm at."
1,Bad product,"This ""treats"" smell so bad, I could barely stand opening them to give some to my cat, and my cat, who is not really finicky could stand them even less. She smelled them, turned away and would not eat for the life or her! I have vowed never to buy from this brand anymore. Unfortunately, since I opened the bag I do not even think I could get reimbursed! And that is a real shame."
1,Cat wouldn't touch them!,"I opened up the product when it arrived. It smells like oily machinery. I thought maybe my sense of smell might have been off and raised the package up to my cat's face. He actually cringed his nose and ran in the other direction. Since opening a package and offering it up to him to see his reaction is usually the solid gold moniker for knowing if he's going to like the new treat, this was definite proof that it wasn't just me. The package wasn't expired and in fact had a long period of time to go before that would happen. Bad batch? I'm not sure... but I won't waste the money on this product ever again."
3,Some Good Some Bad,"This book is very much an academic book. Some of the recommendations are very mainstream that cities are doing already. Many cities are dedensifying the inner cities to spread the poverty around. (I think that is likely a good thing--it has a good chance of reducing spatial mismatch.) However, their plan for diversifying suburbs with minorities and women who will likely vote democratic because more people in the suburbs vote than in inner cities . . . and therefore congress will be predominantly democratic and voting for those policies favorable to cities . . . is not exactly absurd, but it is a bit forced."
2,A Parody,"I love Elizabeth Bevarly's books and have given them great reviews in the past, but this one seems to be a parody of her style.The story is lots of fun. The hero is wonderful. The problem is that she uses her style of interrupting introspection with cute little asides--well, you know what I mean. She does this far too often. Should have used a FIND and cut out at least half of them. All her novels are beginning to sound the same and that gets old after a while--and in this one, just too much.One other problem is that three of her characters have a great deal of unpleasant baggage which Ms. Bevarly handles very well. Unfortunatley, she has to give the secondary male baggage, too. His problem is dropped into the end of the story and completely unneccessary. It would have been nice to have one normal person here.If you haven't read Elizabeth Bevarly before, you'll enjoy this novel. It's just when you've read her most recent ones that you notice she's not fresh anymore."
2,I Couldn't Finish It,"I got to page 106 and had to quit reading. I got so tired of reading the same thing over and over again. In one paragraph she mentions three times about him living in Central America. That got very old, fast!I'm giving it two stars and not one because I hope to pick it back up someday and not find it so monotonous because I did like the main male character and the storyline."
1,Not Good,I am an avid reader of both historical and contemporary romance stories and this book just could not grab me. I didn't make it past the 6th chapter.
4,A Great Read!!!,"This was the first time I've read this author and I have to say I really liked her style. I thought the heroine, Claire was a strong and believable character and I really enjoyed reading about the sparks between Claire and Ramsey. I would recommend this book to my friends!"
1,Breaks prematurely,"Installed the IRRI-TAPE on the side of my home to deter woodpeckers. In the first installation, the tape broke in one week after rubbing the bracket by wind. I replaced the tape and give just enough tension to keep the tape suspended between brackets and not hit my wall and make noise. But the tape broke again after one week.I think the tape will survive longer if I install it very loose, but I couldn't do it because the tape made noise by hitting my wall."
1,Didn't do the trick,Unfortunately this item didn't deter the flock of pigeons that inhabit our barn.They are still here despite the use of this item and other Bird-X deterrents.
1,Doesn't work,"We bought this and the birds be gone hoping to keep purple grackles from flying across our deck, under the roof covering it. Well, it is good for a laugh...they sat on them, under them. Finally bought a net and hung that up. It worked. No more cleaning up after the birds!we have ordered a roll down screen as a permanent solution."
2,guitar rock?,"I first heard Skinny Puppy through Vivisect VI and was completely blown away by the overlays, the constant experiments with timbres, and ingeneous use of samples; shades of musique concrete with a backbeat. Rabies made me give up on Skinny Puppy for a while until someone convinced me to see them live and realize that true creativity wasn't a one time accident for the band. This slag heap of an album was the accident. The songs are more incoherent than innovative, and the lack of a unifying sound is unfortunate. Ranks with Ministry's ""Mind"" album and the entire career of Trent Resnor as the baffling link between truly creative industrial of the early eighties and Kid Rock."
3,Dear bonehead web programmers at Amazon,"This Cd is listed as coming out in 2001.The first review was written in 2000 (so it's not about this particular pressing) but the review talks about a specific pressing, saying it sounds much better.This happens a lot, people write a positive (or negative) review about a specific release of a cd or movie (remastered version much better, directors cut horrible, etc) so their rating and review isn't just for the cd/movie, it's about the specific release they were reviewing.The best example I can think of is the move ""The Warriors Ultimate Directors Cut"". People trashed that version, giving it one star, though they liked the original version. But you've added those negative reviews to the original version as well."
2,Rabies- One of SP's most unfocused,"Look, some people give out stars like water on a hot day. A review above mine states that there are only two good songs here and he still gives it four stars. This is one of the worst and most poorly realised S.P. albums. Skinny Puppy knew it and stated it themselves. There are about four good tracks, and even they are not as good as what is good on Last Rights, Too Dark Park or VIVIsectVI. Try one of those. Of course if your idea of industrial music is Rob Zombie, then this is the Puppy album you'll like most."
4,"One killer album, a pity it's not longer.","At first I was dissapointed, but after playing it several times it grew on me. It realy is one of their best albums; more structured and less chaotic than TOO DARK PARK, but not as 'tuneful' as REMISSION. This is possibly their best release."
1,poorly written book,"I admit I do not write well. But neither does this author. The best part of this book is the first couple chapters when he talks about his life experiences in Haiti, Russia, and Mexico. After that put the book down. The rest of this book isn't really focused. He seems to repeat himself every other chapter. I just didn't get his structure. I didn't really agree with his conclusions... although I don't think he actually had any. He sort of implies what should be done, but I don't think that is the point of this point.To me it seemed like a man who doesn't like what is going on with third world medicine and decided to rant about it. Not really going anywhere with it, just rant. If you agree with his thoughts/conclusions/rants you may love this book, but I don't think it will sway anyone."
3,3.5 stars,"I greatly respect Dr. Farmer's work and have followed Partners In Health's efforts in Haiti over the last several years. While this book has substantive significance in its attempts to discuss several public health and human rights crises in their social, economic, and political contexts; I think it fails to make a cohesive point or tell a cohesive story in the way that a book (rather than a collection of essays) demands. As a public health and human rights worker, I understand where Farmer was trying to go with his writing but I don't think he actually gets there in a coherent way. Perhaps he should have focused only on one health issue or country in order to more fully flesh out his thesis.I do recommend this book as well as a visit to the Partners in Health web site at www.pih.org."
3,Physician Heal Thyself,"Generally an excellent book, except for the Cuban adulation. Speaking of human rights and pathologies of power, why no mention of Oscar Biscet, the Cuban M.D., human rights activist and political prisoner?"
4,Truly a labor of love!,"Featuring the two 'snakes' Bernie Marsden and Mickey Moody,plus legendary Neil Murray and John Lingwood,this Company delivers,aided by the strong and inspired vocals of one Swedish Stefan Berggren.This is a beautiful and long awaited album full of nostalgia and also new blood;for the die-hard Whitesnake/Coverdale fans this album is a special treat:full on smokey blues and rock'n'roll that stands proudly aside ""Ready and Willing""."

2,It smells awful,I put it around the outside perimeter of the house. Upon returning home that day the whole house inside smelled like moth balls. I switched to Snake Stopper and it works just as well.
1,Pretty sure it doesn't work.,"Tried using this for the past year and thought it worked until the last 3 weeks. We have a racer (I'm OK with it...my wife on the other hand...!) in our yard that I don't want to kill. I saw it in the yard and I walked out with the Snake-A-Way and tried to sprinkle it behind the snake trying to chase it out of the yard. I think I bothered it more than the crushed moth-balls! It finally curled up in a hole by a fence so I sprinkled the stuff around leaving a swath open where the snake could escape...I also put some DIRECTLY ON the snake, but it just sat there.One week later, snake was back sunning itself ON the area I'd sprinkled previous (supposed to last 3 months)! Had to chase it out again with a rake! Will have to start looking for some other repellent!"
2,seed not what it used to be for large birds,"The large bird seed is getting to be like mediumbird seed. What happened to the peppers, peanuts,and pellets that used to be in it? The seeds are very small. My birds don't like it."
4,good value,i have been ordering this product for a long time. it does not contain a lot of the premium items that are found in the more expensive parrot food. however it is very good. i mix it with the more expensive stuff and my parrot enjoys the mix.
4,Use as treats,My African grey like some of these seeds and throws out the ones she dislikes. She doesn't like the pellets in this mix I have to buy a different pellet. She is spoiled
4,Good deal for $$,For the price paid it is a great deal. I have been paying more than twice as much for same quality of food at Petsmart.
5,Teacher Writes Intuitive and User Friendly Book,"The ""Build Your Own Web Site"" book by David Karlins is easy to follow. I create web sites in XHTML and so the chapter on Dreamweaver was especially useful. The pictures are very instructive and add to the comprehension of the subject!""Wivianne Runske,Teacher and journalistStockholm, Sweden"
4,Building your website,This book is straight to the point and does not require to be read in any particular sequence aside from the 1st chapter. After that you can bounce around to the sections you need which impact you most. Good reading and a good resource.
3,Overall -- Not too shabby,"Covers fairly extensive areas of HTTP and is useful when usedas a stepping stone for other technologies that utilize this specificprotocol (i.e. JSP). It's one of the few books on this topic and is a nice short reference to get kickstarted into the technologies HTTP really supports. For the price, good buy."
4,great upgrade for my discman!,"I have bought my HT850 for 25DM ($...) almost a give awayit is an excellent choice for upgrading your ""basic"" headphones that comes with most walkmans,mp3 players, discman's e.o.It is not as good as my ($160) Beyerdynamic770pro, but when traveling itis far more practical! and a pleasure to listen to (especialy non classical music)"
3,"Okay, but not Good enough for the price","I am an audio and lighting expert at my local high school. We have some pretty good equipment there. I have used these headphones to test alot of audio signals. Sometimes, though, there will be a pop or too much signal. By the time I saw these headphones as unusable, I had blown out the bass and the highs. I think that the price is too much for how short they last under some not-so-good-conditions."
5,A Solid Effort For A Band Ahead Of Its Time...,"Whatever happened to bands with original numbers and powerful, smart horn sections?!?! Call off the dogs - the search is over! I've followed HLN since its inception with the self-titled album in 1980. These guys come from humble garage band/bar room beginnings and really get back to their roots with this 1991 effort. I really think they hit their sophomore slump with Small World (which wasn't all that bad), but it looks like they're back on track. Can't wait to get my mits on Plan B, their latest installment. Get this album - it's gold!"
5,the album with the lot,"this is the ultimate feel good album, from the opening track to a couple of days of you are on a high . the bands energy and class shine through on this album. Each track is very different from the next but combined you can tell huey was definetly hard at play."
2,A low point,"This is the worst album of HLN's career. They've shucked horn arrangements and rich vocal arrangements -- the two things that made them great and unique. The title track is the only memorable one -- and it's really just a party-song that sounds like it's aiming to become a beer-commercial or sports game crowd-rousing staple. Fortunately the band rebounds somewhat with the next original album, Plan B."
1,Bosch Tankless Water Heater,"This product worked fine for about 10 weeks. It then started shuting down while in the middle of the shower. Turning off the water and then turning the water back on, the unit would then start delivering hot water. I contacted tech support numerous times and they say nothing is wrong with the unit. They want me to send pictures of the installation, have a gas tech come out ($80.00 my expense)and check the gas pressure on thier side of the gas regulator. The last tech I talked to said to turn the gas shut off valve almost off and see if that helped. It does help but did not fix the problem. Think about it, use your gas shout off valve to make it work right. He said that my ground water temp was probaly too warm (71 degrees). They will not tell me in writing what they require of me to get the unit replaced or what they deem wrong enough to replace the unit. Apparently working fine for 10 weeks and then sending cold water during your shower daily is not enough."
1,horrible the worst,Going one 3 years now and yet again another part has broken!I have had to replace the hydro generator the pilot gas limiter and the main limiter. This has been a waste of money. I have now spent more on this water heater than a more expensive reliable unit.I am going to get rid of this pos POS and get a better one.Do not but this water heater unless you got losts of money and don't mind cold showers.
2,my aqulstar dead after 7 years,"I had a aqulstar for about 7 years w/o any problem before.last night when I using hot water I noticed that the fire did not stop after I turn the water off.Then my units get overheated and I found ash coming down (due to copper piper burnt), water pipe leaking (maybe o ring get burnt).It is dangerous. my house may get either burnt or flooded if I did not see this."
2,Wrong Heater,"Ordered this to find out it was not the right one for my application to start. When we received the unit it was missing the controls cover plate and there were screws and the igniter loose in the original box. We shipped it back the next day and had to pay for the return due to we bought the wrong unit, regardless of the missing parts. THat is ok it was my fault for not reading the technical manual better, taught me a lesson."
5,Haynes Automotive Electrical Maunal,"This book is fantastic in explaining how to find and fix a problem with a cars electrical system. Tells you what tools to use, how to use them, and how to go about making repairs. This book is a must for any weekend mechanic who gets anxious at the thought of working on electircal problems."
4,Automotive electrical,"This is a good, fairly comprehensive book on basic automotive wiring. It gives enough information that you can proceed without always having a schematic or a step by step, connect the dots, diagram. Well worth the cost."
5,"Sexy, Powerful, and Original","Wow, this is the most original and sexy book of photos that I have seen in a long time! Here is someone who looks at sexuality in a way that is really fresh and unique, and is not afraid to show all kinds of women and all kinds of moods. It took me a few hours to get through it the first time - I was drawn into the photos like I was entering a new world.The book is nicely done too, with over 300 photographs, on good rich paper with a solid binding. I'm not sure what the last reviewer is talking about - there are far more photos in this book than most photography books. I will treasure this one for years."
3,Uneven...,"Quite a varierty here. Here are some specifics:The girls are variable from punk style to petite to a few voluptuous ones. Too many for me are in a trashy 60-70s retro style. Some female genetalia is shown, mostly shaved (cool;>). some SM shots but mostly bondage and some couples. Alot of "" dramatic"" lighting and alot of out-of-perspective shots where edges of pictures are exaggerated through a wideangle lens I guess. One particular shot features an eyeball appearing larger than the girl's breast in the same shot. Some shots are ruined by printing over two pages. Girls, thank you for not smoking--a gross fetish for me. Still a number or arousing situations--particularly for fans of young, smallish looking women. I'd recommend this over Beauty Parade, but not over Beauty of Fetish."
3,Great shape and color...but.,"I love the unique shape and bold color of this necklace. However, the ""bold color"" bled all over my white shirt the first time I wore it. Ruined the shirt. I suppose that's what I get for buying items on ""limited time blowout""."
3,Pretty and delicate.,"I bought this piece several months ago and have worn it several times, though I am not personally crazy about a ""lariat"" style of necklace. I would have liked it better if it were just a circular choker. In fact, I have decided to take it apart and make a choker using leather cording and the ""poppy"" shells.The only problem I have with it as a necklace is that some of the beading string can be seen in between two of the flowers. I would suggest using a permanent marker in either orange or red to color any part of the exposed string, (which looks dirty, btw...probably from string wax or something). Otherwise, it is rather lovely. The colors remind me of tangerines and blood oranges. It has an extender chain, so I imagine it should be able to fit any size neck."
3,Perfect McFerrin,"Not the type of CD that makes me stop what I'm doing and listen, but the sort that invokes that comfortable ""at peace"" feeling. It's more ""produced"" that other McFerrin CD's that I've heard, but very well done. If you like what Bobby McFerrin has done in the past, I'm sure you'll appreciate this work.I purchased it to study his treatment of the 23rd Psalm which is first rate work.Recorded at Skywalker Ranch so the sound quality is sterling - a real treat to listen to."
5,Traffic stopper,"I happened to catch the last number on the car radio, and was so overwhelmed I had to pull over and compose myself. Which is why I bought the CD, and it is all good."
2,Thought this book would be better,"It wasn't at all what I expected. Author promised it would be ""extremely funny"" but it was only mildly amusing. Too many side jokes, but not really any substance."
3,I liked it,"I thought that the book was funny and being female I focused more on Pastor Hagee's side of the book. I was not to fascinated with the female side of the book because it made it seem almost impossible to be this ""ideal"" person."
3,"1 Book, Not 2","What is essentially 1 books in 1, this appears to be a fairly competent book written by Diana Hagee that the publisher was afraid wouldn't sell. So, they tacked on a series of ramblings by Ms. Hagee's more famous husband, John, and tried to promote the book as a comprehensive treatment of what men and women are looking for in a mate. John's section is really unfocused and does not give much insight for men. However, Diana's section is very organized and provides excellent instruction for both men and women. Using as an outline the top 10 things a woman wants in a man, based on surveys conducted at the Hagee's church, Diana provides practical advice about how women can foster these characteristics in their husbands as well as in themselves. Though feminist will not appreciate the advice and God's promises are at times turned into prosperity thinking, the relational advice is a great reminder to those recently married, as well as those who have been working at marriage for many years."
5,Husband and wife book to read together,"We have a lot of John Hagee books on our book shelf including DVD's of his teachings. He is one of our favorite authors and pastor to watch on T.V. Have not finished reading the book, but this is the book I have given to family as gifts. The truth of the Word of God is spoken from the Hagee family and it is all in love."
5,WAVES AHOY,"This wonderful memoir of a World War II WAVE Gunner's Mate is lively, interesting, and a great 'you were there' story. I met Josette at a National WAVES Reunion in Washington D.C. along with Capt Mildred Macaffee, Adm Gracie Hopper, and other legends of this generation. They truly showed those of us who followed them into the Navy the way to do our job well, take pride in our work, and most of all, 'be a lady' while we were doing so. Well done, Josette! From a Chief Aviation Electronic Tech (Enlisted Air Warfare Specialist/Naval Aircrewman) USNR-RET"
4,Cockpits of the Cold War,Over all the book was found of great intrest. I would have like a little more detail explaing the gauges in the cockpits. Over all good source material.
5,Excellent choice,"This is an excellent watch for lifetime. I'm so glad about its appearance and its mechanism. Definitively you can feel safe and elegant when you put it in your wrist. The book, scale airplane and all the objects in the box are perfect. Please, take note that the case diameter is 44 mm."
2,"Incredibly dense, hard to learn anything","Of all the classes I've taken so far (senior in Computer Science Engineering), this was by far the hardest book to get through. I found it insanely difficult to glean any information at all from it. If you need it for a class, you don't really have a choice, but if you're reading this for fun, I would recommend looking at other books."
1,Amazon's Fault?,"Well, I was looking up my favorite Phantom music when I found this CD. I listened to the samples of music they gave, and was entranced by the lovely Phantom and the voice of Christine. I bought it without a second thought.Though I assumed that it was a mistake that the song 'Memory' from Cats played as 'Music of the Night' I assumed that was simply a mistake and dismissed it.However, I got the CD today, and eagerly put it into my walkman. Out came a Christine and Phantom duet I had never heard before. And was eager to avoid!!!They were horrid singers!! Definetly NOT the Angels I had anticipated....Let the buyer beware... I'm terribly disappointed."
4,Really Great,I know i'm really young but when I first heard the Phantom of the opera i was fasinated. i never really heard the cd but i used to own the tape and it was great
1,wrong artists,"ISBN 056775077723 is not the cd with Charles Hart, John Barrowman and Claire Moore.This isbn is for a terrible version with the Orlando Pops conducted by Andrew Lane with mezzo soprano; Marguerite Krull and baritone; Justin White. This version the singing lacks passion and is grating and the orchestra is disjointed and thoroughly unmelodic.Thank goodness I bought used for only a $1. I still want the one with Barrowman and Moore."
5,"If You Don't Think You Like ""New Age Music"", You Haven't Heard THIS!","I never considered myself a ""fan"" of New Age music until I discovered this album (...as well as Ray Lynch's other excellent releases.) But don't just take MY word for it, I'll give you an example of how good this album is:I used to work at a record store that gave us a rather limited selection of what we could play ""in-store"", so we would play ""defectives"" from the ""returns"" bin. This was one of them. The first time I played it we sold three copies that evening. Need I say more?"
2,Eh...,"This book is very detailed, and is quite humorous and fun the read. However, the acuracy is lacking. He was very cruel in his portrayal of Grissom, implying through the writing that he was at fault for the sinking of the capsule, when there is a good deal of evidence against that. Plus, I read an interview with Shepard where he said that it would have been nice if Wolfe had interviewed teh astronauts themselves before writing it. Yes, that would have been nice. But, like I said before, it is an entertianing book. But if your looking for facts, there are much better sources."
3,"Sometimes ""The Wrong Stuff""","Tom Wolf did a great job with most of his facts. However I believe he made a dreadful mistake when he implied Gus Grissom panicked and blew the hatch on the Liberty Bell 7. The official investigation did not place any blame on Gus. Yet Tom Wolfe would make the reader believe Gus was some kind of fool. If that were the case, would NASA have then given him command of both the first Gemeni and Apollo flights?Obviously Tom Wolfe must have felt the needed to smear the name and reputation of this National Hero -- many years after Gus, Ed White and Roger Chaffee had died in the launch pad fire of Apollo 1 on January 27, 1967. It was certainly too late for Gus to defend himself personally. Others can help by understanding that ""The Right Stuff"" is wrong about Gus Grissom."
4,non-fiction as a novel,"Tom Wolfe who definitely ranks as one of my favourite authors wrote this brilliant book about the Mercury Space Program. He illustrates perfectly how and why these seven astronauts were hailed as heroes, the setting for the story and what made these men tick. It's also very funny and can only really be described as Intellectual Top Gun. The one criticism I have about the book is that Tom Wolfe could have concluded the book by telling us what happened to these men and how the space program developped, even if he does it in a small epilogue. Nonetheless, it's hugely entertaining. You'll enjoy it."
5,Great Book,"As a young kid, I carefully followed the Mercury astronauts, and later the Gemini and Apollo astronauts. I enjoyed this book. Wolfe's admiration for the astronuats' ( as well as test pilot Chuck Yeager's ) courage is clear. But this is not a whitewash, and at least some of the astronauts gave way to the temptations of stardom. The movie is worth seeing too."
2,"Fantastic book, but Kindle edition riddled with errors","I've owned ""The Right Stuff"" for over thirty years in print form. I downloaded the Kindle version from Amazon to take with me on business trips.To my disgust, the Kindle edition is abysmal - clearly, Amazon or whoever came up with it ran the print edition through a character-recognition software program and utterly failed to copy-edit it afterwards. The number of errors is alarming, and it is only because I've read the print version so many times that I was able to recognize what some of the errors meant in the text.It's a shame, because this book is a fine, fine book and one of my all-time favorites. Shame on Amazon or the publisher or both for charging $10.00 for a flawed, poorly-edited copy."
2,"Great book, KINDLE version FULL OF ERRORS","Great book, completely flubbed by Amazon. Is it so hard to run a spell check on a Kindle manuscript before publishing it? This book is filled with ridiculous OCR screwups: letters cl being turned into a nonsensical d, for instance. And there are a lot of them. Amazon needs to fix this book and send us all an updated version that doesn't hurt our eyes or our brains."
2,Wolfe is not in his element,"Wolfe says in the preface that it is a pity that there is no literature to describe the experiences of real fighting men, and so he set out to make some. Wrong. There are excellent books written by the men themselves who have been there--pilots, army men, scouts, you name it. However, these books are not of the sort read by the audience of the New Yorker. Wolfe has created something on the subject that is palatable to those folks, and with that they are impressed."
1,all i know is,"the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book ""fiction"" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story. Especially how Grissom is protrayed in whole ""hatch"" issue."
2,The Wrong Stuff,"I thought I would read this book after seeing a long reference to it in ""Adventures in the Screenwriting Trade"" by William Goldman. Goldman describes writing a screenplay of this book which was never used because of factors beyond his control. Goldman, who wrote Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, gives a synopsis of The Right Stuff that made me interested in reading the novel.I had to put the book down after the first chapter. Wolfe's flippant style is grating. After each fatal crash he mockingly repeats his description of the trainees ritualistic behavoir in donning their bridge coats (their formal uniform) to attend the funeral.The writer relates how worried the young pilots wives are, how they live in fear that their men are going to crash and burn. This is an unusual viewpoint to take in writing about heroic figures. It's as if someone sat down to write a book about Caesar or William the Conqueror written from the perspective of their worried wives..."
2,The Golden Age of Jets or Cliche',"This story made me chuckle. It is full of cliche' and most of it is based on narrow shreds of fact. I only read Wolfe's novel because in my former profession (USAF Pilot), I kind of felt like it was required reading."
2,"Amazon, please fix these mistakes!!!","Actually, I haven't read the Kindle version and thanks to the people who explained about all the mistakes, I'm not going to! I have it in paperback and it's a great book, so Amazon: please fix these mistakes!!!"
5,One of the most entertaining nonfiction books I've read,"Wolfe really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and despite being accused of taking liberties with the literal truth still creates a book that will teach you a great deal about the history of the early days of the American space program. This is one of the only nonfiction books I've read that reads like a well written novel. I will be diving further into the Wolfe cannon because this book was so good."
5,Excellent!!!,"I read this book more than 10 years ago, but it's still one of the books that has made the strongest impression on me. One of the things that really struck me, was the way he describes how the test-pilots (headed by Yeager) are first laughting at the ""astronauts"", and then are mesmerized by the fact that Shepard, Glen & co become heroes. To me, this visualizes the insanity in how the american people put them on a pedestal and considered the astronauts the greatest americans (why be modest? PEOPLE) ever."
5,The Illustrated edition makes it worth buying Again!,"Of course this book has been a classic for more than 25 years. Now the newest edition, with loads of images and documentary material, makes another copy in my library a great purchase.When you read in his story about how the astronauts were Luce's boys, you get to see the ""Life"" magazine covers and spreads. When you read about the hangouts for Drinking & Driving for the jet jockeys, you can see them here. The illustrations make this edition a wonderful record of American pop culture and iconography. Buy it again, and enjoy turning the pages."
4,"Good book, except for smearing Gus Grissom","Very good book that takes you inside the minds of test pilots and astronauts. But Gus Grissom gets a raw deal being portrayed as a screw up. Gus was one of the most careful by the book do it right guys in the entire space program. In all later Mercury missions where the hatch was blown by the astronaut he received a bruse from the recoil of the mechanism. Gus didn't have a mark on him, he could not have paniced and blown the hatch. He did admit that his helmet could possibly have tripped the hatch blow actuator due to the wave action on the capsule. But Wolf did a great disservice by malighing a man who wasn't around to defend himself."
5,Rough and Raw - Just like the Land is,"A short story collection that sure deserve attention. First of all, the writing is absolutely impressive. It takes you to Wyoming, takes you there pretty close, beneath an open sky of all possible colors and hard, sunburned land that turn's into dust, when your boots hit it. The stories are refreshingly weird (in a positive way, understood?!), grabbing the reader by his collor and tearing him out of everyday life .... Her [Annie Proulx's] work is a gift. Reading a pleasure, time spent in a purpose, like ""the path is the destination"". Mighty good read with a literary quality to it that makes your heart pound take up a step and your eyes moving faster over the pages, anxious to devour them. Howdy."
4,brokeback ....and others,"This book was very entertaining, and it was interesting to see the differences between the screenplay and the story of Brokeback Mountain. i really enjoyed all the stories, once i got past the grammar and dialect issues."
1,"Inaccurate, trivial, stupid","Important news item: Not everyone in Wyoming is degenerate and stupid. The author of these stories plain and simple does not know or understand Wyoming. She only wrote what people want to believe. Isn't it interesting everyone in her stories is basically the same,a dissipated bum? Boring after awhile, no?"
5,Written with Heart,"Masterful storytelling about a harsh land and strong characters who inhabit it. I think you have to love a land, and a people, to write about them so honestly and with such heart. As I finished each story, I felt the urge to stomp the mud from my (nonexistent) boots and brush the dust from my pants before surfacing into the light of my city life. Just one title that kept me turning the pages: ""People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water."" I don't keep many books, preferring to pass them along to another life in the hands of other readers, but this one gets a spot on my bookshelf."
3,Brokeback Mountain Stands Out,"Proulx is an intriguing writer as she captures what I am assuming is the language and thinking of Wyoming, a gnarled, telegraphic style that often surrenders into poetry. It's not an easy style and requires work. The characters are as gnarled and orney as their language and thought, and their behavior is odd but realistic. All of these things are true of Brokeback Mountain, my original reason for reading the book, and it's clear why the producers of the movie chose this story for the screen. It economcially, deftly and dramatically portrays the whole life of love fulfilled and lost that the movie makes into a stirring romance."
3,As dense as a piece of cheddar cheese (low fat).,"The writing is so spare there's not an ounce of fat there. Ideas, characters, and stories are densly packed into what must be the minimum workable wordage. Like any rich food it's not to be rushed. As for roughneck stories - I still prefer Steinbeck."
5,wow,"If you want to know what all the fuss is about with Annie Proulx and can't quite make it through her novels, these stories are the place to start. They're beautiful, vivid and brilliant and, like the Wyoming plains and mountains they're set it, sometimes brutal. The collection ends with ""Brokeback Mountain"". If you've seen the movie, you have to read this story - it's all there, a two-hour film in 30 pages. Amazing."
4,Bought it just for Broke Back Mountain,"I bought some signed and first editions for the Broke Back Mountain effects. They were all on sale, and going like hot cakes when the movie came out. Good memorabilia."
3,Tales of Wyoming,A beautifully written collection of stories that captures the isolation and living experience in Wyoming. A lot about horses and ranching.The stories vary in quality -- some are excellent and others I couldn't get into. I skipped through a couple of them. The subject matter is bit depresing at times and not a book to read when you're feeling down. I especially liked Brokeback Mountain which sparked the wonderful movie of the same name.Ms. Proulx is a literary writer of considerable skill and this book is a worthy read if not an outstanding one.
2,annie takes a little time off,"Don't expect anything like previous Annie Proulx works here. This collection of grim/goofy tales has all the staying power of a candy bar. Nowhere is the depth and complexity of her earlier works. ""Close Range"" left me with the feeling that it was written over a couple of weekends (spread far apart), and did not receive the writer's full effort. Her readers deserve better."
4,Vomitous stories well crafted.,"Annie Proulx is a master wordsmith. Her ""Close Range"" abounds with a unique talent for quick-sketched technicolor mind paintings. No other author comes close to her compelling style. Yet the yarns she spins in Close Range describe a Wyoming ranch life totally foreign to this `30s ranch-raised vaquero whose memories are breach-loaded with hard-working, straight-shooting, honorable men and women who wouldn't stoop to the four-letter vocabulary so generously woven throughout this book. Except, perhaps, the single truncated four-letter contraction of ""manure"" which cannot be ignored by ranch hands. The stories range from depressing to disgusting, yet altogether well told."
3,A lot of the same,Proulx's style of writing takes some getting used to. I was hoping to enjoy these stories as much as I had enjoyed Accordian Crimes but after a while the stories all started to sound the same to me. She seems to delight in taking a small moment in time (the six seconds to ride a bull at a rodeo) and expand that moment of time out with lots of internal monologue and flash back. While these techniques can be great tools for character development she just doesn't manage much of that in these stories leaving all the stories to bleed together like one disjointed stream of conciousness account of Wyoming.
2,A difficult read - at best,"Maybe I'm just a simple guy. I don't want to have to concentrate when I read something for pleasure. I just want to... read it. If you skim as you read you'll miss out and have to go back.Also, her subject matters were distasteful, i.e. the first story about a skinned animal and the final story about two hicks who find out they're homosexuals (I didn't just ruin either of these stories for you.)In most of her stores, there's no real `end'. They just sort of go along, and then she gets tired of writing and puts `the end' and goes on to the next one.Not a satisfying read at all."
1,"Sorry Wyoming, we know better.","This sordid, dark, ugly filth is not the Wyoming my grandparents hailed from. I have known many persons from ranches in that state and they are hard working, forthright and resourceful. They may not be saints but they are nothing like this mess. Spend your money on something else, like a nice travel guide to Wyoming and go see for yourself what a rigerous, diverse country this really is. There are fewer people in Wyoming per sq. mile than there are in Alaska as well as a far more diverse wildlife population. The folks there have better things to do than live like this book."
2,.....yawn....,"I bought this book to read the much-lauded ""Brokeback Mountain"" on a dare from my nephew who calls it ""Brokebutt Mountain."" NO we are not anti-gay so don't start! This book is simply not in the same league as ""The Shipping News."" Proulx does not know my neighbors in Wyoming and it shows in this collection; she changes views of us westerners faster than Michael Jackson changed noses! I just hope she leaves Montana alone...."
4,"Quirky, evocative, totally original","As a Wyomingite, I had to suspend my defensiveness about how the state and it's people are portrayed. Most Wyomingites probably don't view their beloved state in as grim, desolate, and lonely a light as the stories describe. However, when Proulx writes about the wind, the cold, the sagebrush, the vast expanses that are Wyoming (all of which have their own beauty, just like the mountains, the meadows and alpine lakes), I recognize it immediately as home. The writing is superb, most especially the ""flights of fancy"". Wyoming is defined by its rugged individualism and lack of patience for greenhorns and liberals (some small pockets of the state aside). Most people here drink coffee, not lattes. ""Flights of fancy"" aren't commonplace. In my opinion, in many ways Proulx has us dead to rights."
3,Home On the Range,"You have to hand it to Larry McMurtry for having seen the potential in this little story which did nothing for me when I read it. It goes to show that reading itself is a talent, not to mention writing. I found this a rather thin read, never anticipating its extraordinary visual or dramatic possibilities. It is a text book case of the art of adaptation. Proulx has expressed her satisfaction with the film version, saying that she felt that it had been translated unchanged to the screen with just a few minor changes. The film, of course, is gorgeous. Here I found the prose as thin as that mid-western air. Still, McMurtry saw it all, bought the rights, and the rest is history."
5,The Best Wyoming writer.,"Having spent the first 18 years of my life in Wyoming, it's rare to come across material that captures the spirit of 'the west' without sugar-coating it, but still coming away with a deep understanding of why Wyoming has such a magnetic pull in spite of its harsh reality."
2,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is the only story worth your time","Bought this after seeing the magnificent film, ""Brokeback Mountain"". As a longtime reader of western fiction and non-fiction, I was disappointed with the other stories in ""Close Range"". How many times can a writer put down the stories of ignorant and/or down-and-out folk in short-story format without becoming repetitive? Proulx does it 10 times in this book, but finishes with the intense and heartbreaking ""Brokeback Mountain"". The reader cares about Ennis and Jack-- a feeling for characters not experienced in the first 250 pages of this story collection. Worth $14? You decide."
2,grisly,"I read and loved Shipping News but was not prepared for this book. I read 3 stories, each more grisly and disturbing than the last, and decided to write a review as a warning."
2,Hard to read,"I wish I could say I loved this book. I admire Annie Proulx's writing, and she writes wonderful discriptives of people and places. But I find the sentence structure and choppiness hard to read. Then again I am not a professional literary critic, I can only say what I like and dislike. Of course I am one of those people who like poetry to rhyme, so what do I know? There are some stories I liked in the book. My favorite was BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, but as much as this story is praised, I find it had some of the same ""choppiness"" I mentioned before. The story it tells, however, is beautiful. Not as ""romantic"" as the movie...the short story has a gritty realism that really grabs hold of you. I also liked the BLOOD MARE...this story made me laugh out loud. A lot the stories force you to read between the lines, and I'm not a fan of this type of writing. I read for pleasure when I'm reading fiction, and I don't like to have to ""work at"" understanding something."
1,Boring,"After reading this book, I have now given this author three chances to ""wow"" me. I know I am in the minority here, but I do not like Ms. Proulx's style. Her characters are unappealing and a waste of time to read about. Her stories are loaded with violence and abnormalities. The only story I liked out of this collection was the last one. For a much better author, and stories, on the same themes, I prefer Larry McMurtry."
1,Not even close,"This poorly written collection of cartoon-esque stories and characters defies the reader to continue. It is a twisted take on ""Western"" writing that could only have come from an Eastern greenhorn."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"These short stories are are tough as the Wyoming land they're set into. Tales of rough lives at the edge of solitude and despair, unforgiving charachters in an unforgiving land, where even rusty abandoned tractors have a soul, and sex comes with no frills attached. Brokeback Mountain is by no means the only noteworty story in the set, and surely one of the mildest in many ways.Buyer beware: living in this Wyoming is not for the faint of heart. Reading these lyrically written stories of despair and vast loneliness is not either."
3,This is Wyoming? Nooooo!,"There is not one likable character in this collection of short stories. Proulx has a great talent for fresh language and graphic descriptions, but these stories are certainly not an HONEST depiction of life in Wyoming. The stories gradually become boring and almost unreadable because they are so skewed: the endless parade of ignorant and brutal ranchers, loveless marriages, abusive parents, scarred and hateful children, tractors that talk and kill, etc. etc. etc. If Proulx's stories were really Wyoming, then God help the state! And if this author can win a Pulitzer prize, then God help American literature!"
2,"Cowboy Cartoons, Nicely Rendered.","It's clear that Proulx is a skillful prose stylist, and some of the stories are surprising in their plots, but her ""cowboys"" seem like paper doll versions of real people--viewed from outside and ultimately stereotypical. I don't care if it's bleak or if it shows Wyoming in a bad light; I just wanted to believe in these folks. But despite her fine sense of detail, the characters make me think that the author's view is mainly that of a tourist--an ethnographer who has the details right, but draws the spirit of the characters from careful study of ""Gunsmoke"" or some such."
3,"Bleak state, bleak book","Like many people, I read this book because of the movie, ""Brokeback Mountain"". That story is at once representative and different than the rest of the book. It's representative because it's about cowboys/ranchers who lead bleak uninteresting lives that are noteworthy only for the violence and misfortune that dog them. It's different because it's actually more hopeful than the rest of the book. At least, these cowboys find love.There are moments of black black humor here, and the writing style is creative and compact, but this is no easy read. If you appreciate literary misery, you may find this an outstanding example of the genre; if you are looking for an enjoyable book with fascinating plot twists, go elsewhere."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I had a hard time finishing this collection. I picked it up because a friend just moved to Wyoming, and I thought I might share it, and because I was intrigued by the excellent watercolors. Although I did finish, it took some work. I did not like the characters I met in these stories, and it does not make me want to visit this state. The desperation, brutality, and sexual violence was disturbing. It is not something I plan to recommend. That said, I felt that the writing itself was good, so perhaps the subject matter was the problem. I don't like to denigrate a book for its content, thereby sounding easy-to-offend, but I was disappointed with and frustrated by the choice of content and the energy that the content, not the writing, gave out. Considering the writing and the paintings, I've tried to find a way to feel comfortable sharing this book but I just can't."
5,Redemptive writing . . .,"I finished Brokeback Mountain last night and wondered what moved me so. Was it just sympathy for the two men? Was it their hard life, there turning away from a love that would have been unthinkable in their day? Was it the soaring prose of Mrs Proulx? Of course, the answer is a bit of all these elements.But is there something more . . . so much more? Something about innocence lost, wasted youth, the tender regrets of middle age, and the inevitable battering by life, leaving us hollow. . . and a bit sentimental for the fading memory of youth . . . when all was possible. This is the transcendent message of Brokeback Mountain."
2,"On second thoughts, maybe skip this one","I wrote a fairly positive review after getting one of these, but shortly thereafter, it permanently stopped playing CDs. Next the alarm became unreliable (not exactly a desired feature in an alarm clock).Finally, the alarm quit altogether. Given the similar reports I'm seeing here..."
1,Horrible Product,"This cd/clock radio could be the poorest quality product I have ever purchased. It lasted for only 3 months - it conventienly outlived its warranty, of course! First the skip function broke on the cd player. That I could live with. Then the cd player broke all together, which was the entire reason I bought it. I figured I would just use it as a radio/alarm only, until a few days later, when the power button broke. Do yourself a favor & do not buy this product."
4,Do you REALLY want to wake up to...,"...a robotic fly head, complete with enormous, multifaceted eyes? If so, this item might be just the thing for you. We chose it to replace our infuriatingly unintuitive Timex ""nature sounds"" clock radio. Setting the alarms is straightforward, the sound is good at low..medium volume, and the display can be clearly read from across the room, which is where I prefer it placed because it looks less malevolent at a distance.I take exception to the ""intuitive layout"" editorial comment above, however. For example, if you insert a CD and hit the ""play"" button, nothing happens. Pressing combinations of buttons and praying to the God of Fly Heads won't bring relief, either, until you pick the thing up, turn it over, and move a little hidden slide switch from ""radio"" to ""CD""."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these players for my kids. Within 3 months the alarm quit working on one unit and within 6 months the CD players quit working on both units. If you plan on using the CD player frequently, buy somethig other than this Memorex"
1,Chinzy CD player,"All I can say is this does not work in any sense of the word. This product's utter failure at what it was designed to do (play cds and tell time) is both amazing and apalling. The top that encloses the cd while its playing (when that works) is horribly mis-aligned. It does not close properly. Also, the digits irritatingly blink on and off. It loses time...up to 40 minutes later than I had set it originally! Right now (after 3 months of tolerating this) it no longer will turn on to play my cds or to turn on the radio tuner. Although the digits still appear (blinking), it doesn't change the time at all. When I try to reset the clock, the digits turn off! Thus NOTHING works right on this thing. It is utterly useless. Don't even think of BUYING this JUNK."
2,Information you can get from the site,These are all taken from Postings/ journals on the IgoUgo.com site. it is only worth buying this if you want the excerpts in pdf format or don't have time to go to the site.
5,An excellent book covering the major ideas of Adler,"The book presents the major works written by Adler himself. The editors give excellent commentary through out the book to help elucidate Adler's main ideas. The editors frequently compare and contrast Adler and Freud, making for very interesting reading. A must for any clinician."
2,Good material buried under inside new age philosophy,"There is probably a good 75-100 page book in here. Unfortunately it is buried in a 400 page rambling discussion of new age philosophy. If you drink new age koolaid by the gallon, this is the book for you; otherwise, look elsewhere."
1,It is pie-in-the-sky,"As long as organizations are primarily run by cold-war management style with modernized command and control via antiquated measurement systems faking empowerment, the entire 'dialogue' is a moot argument. This book is yet another...People are only as good as they are measured and percieved.The architecture of the organization along with its aesthetics, structure and internal/external measurement systems requires open evaluation for any dialog to persist. Rhetoric, game strategy and positioning do not mix with dialogue. They are mutually exclusive, unless 'dialogue' itself is a rhetorical stance -- a hypocritical position.This book is attempting to aesthetize the wrong dialogue."
1,pretty... but that's about it,"I bought this mug a while back, but can honestly say that I've only used it about 3-4 times because it leaks coffee all over my clothes. It doesn't leak where the lid screws on/off but where the stainless steel is connected to the plastic upper. I've tried putting sealant on it, this did not solve the problem, but only made the mug a lot less attractive. I've given up hope for it and for about 10 dollars more, got myself a leak-proof, double walled insulatedThermos Nissan JMW500P6 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottle, Silverthat has a 5 years warranty."
4,A good buy,The mug keeps things hot during a 30-minute commute; the brim is spillproof when closed. I did experience some dripping; it seems that some liquid gets caught under the open lip and drips out the back. The product does not guarantee no leaking so they've covered themselves. The handle is comfortable and fits well in a car's cup holder. It cleans easily.
4,A Must Read,"This book takes readers on a crazy (funny at times), interesting and exciting adventure. I had a hard time putting the book down. I tend to not read many fiction books but this one really wet my palate. I can't wait to read more of Victoria Rose's books. - Cait W."
1,Don't bother,Where's the beef? A very brief travelog with nothing you have not seen before. A total waste of time and money.
5,Truly Amazing Albums.....,"This is Total Perfection..... If u are a fan of Mr. Fagen, this is TRULY an Amazing Package..... A must have......."
4,Donald Fagen is the heart of Steely Dan,If you like Steely Dan you must have this fantastic triple album plus bonos tracks of Donald Fagen because the sound is the same the quality is the same.
5,Outstanding!!!,"This is an absolutely outstanding package. Just the 3 surround 5.1 DVDs are worth the price, the extras included in the MVI package and the extra songs on the CD are just icing on the cake!Listening to the 5.1 versions of the songs is like experiencing the albums in a brand new way. Fagen's obsession with sonic detail has really paid off big time in the surround mixes.Tons of great music and great content on the MVIs for many hours of enjoyment for many years to come.A minor caveat is that none of the disks will play on a DVD-Audio player (unlike the last DVD-Audio version of Morph the Cat and other Steely Dan recent albums), so I can't play the disks in the multi-changer in the car, I have to use the DVD-Video single disk interface. But I wonder these days if DVD-Audio is dead anyway, as both Alan Parsons and Donald Fagen have gone to DVD-Video recently..."
5,Amazing,"First of all, it was no accident that Morph The Cat won a Grammy for best surround sound production. You have literally not heard this album until you've heard it in surround sound - same with the other two. I'm hearing instruments and harmonies I never knew existed in these albums. Sound quality on my home theater (and through good headphones from my computer) is like nothing I've heard before. If these albums aren't already considered reference quality, they should be!I haven't quite made it through all the extras yet, although I was a little annoyed that the interactive computer program hijacks your computer's volume control - I got an email while it was playing and the you've got mail ding about blew me out of my chair! :("
4,"ACURA TL OWNERS, This Will Not Play in Your Car","If you are one of the many Acura TL owners like me who are collecting DVD-Audio disks to use with you ELS Sound system, be advised that these DVDs WILL NOT PLAY. The display gives ""FORMAT ERROR"" and ejects the disk. Which is a damn shame since Trans Island Skyway from Kamakiriad is on the Acura Demo Disk and sounds great. What a shame. Tested in my 2006 Acura TL with Nav.The disks sound great in my home theater, great surround, but I don't want them because that's not what I bought them for."

1,not avery good toy at all,"I've seen many of these reviews and I think this not avery good toy.After I saw the movie didn't think it was worh it, but i would recomend getting a jedi or the clone trooper that hasquick-draw attack."
5,This is the best Emperor figure so far.,"This has to be THE BEST Emperor Palpatine figure EVER. He has ten points of articulation and is very posable. He comes with two lighting projectiles one that can be fired out of his robe and another that is so far totally useless. Emperor Palpatine also comes with a very durable(for once, NOT like the jedi lightsabers) red lightsaber that fits snug in his hand. The most amazing part of this figure though is his head. His head is AMAZING, it is VERY descriptive and looks exactly like his face in ROTJ, PURE EVIL. The hood is removable so you can have a 360 degree view of his face. I recommend this figure for any Star Wars fan."
4,bday surprise,"We looked at every store for the emperor and couldn't find it at xmas time, so when I finally found it online it was great. My 4-year-old son had been looking for it for his collection for a while! He needed to have ""bad guys"" to fight with. This was a bday present and went over very well. He liked the lightening."
4,Post Arrest Attempt Palpatine.,"The only complaint I have is that the feet are not meant to move beyond shifting the angle of their position, this Emperor is not going to do a running pose. The nice features are a launching and pose force lightning in two different pieces. The firing lightning does not have a lock, in short it is spring and hand pulling power that get your distance on it. The detail of the figure is excellent, post arrest attempt for film context. The lightsaber is true to the film and the blade unlike earlier figures is firmly part of the handle so no loosing the blade! Hood is removable while the whole robe is plastic it still creates an excellent effect for any collection."
4,Perfect for Our Situation,"This is the only secondhand book I ever found dealing with the birth of Jesus that is friendly, simple, does not portray Jesus as a blond babydoll, and does not go heavily into the Biblical aspects of Jesus' birth. Perfect for households with people of blended religious beliefs."
5,Must be made into a movie!!,"I loved this book, once i started reading it i couldnt put it down. This is story that must be made into a movie!!"
1,frontline flea,well its a month later and every cat still has fleaswill not buy again with these results i could have tried something a lot cheaper
1,Worked only one season!,"This unit worked for one summer, I stored it indoors and set it up the next spring. It refused to work so I cleaned the lines with a CO2 cartridge. That didn't work so I sent it to the manufacturer. They sent back a rebuilt unit that worked for one day. It seems the lines get clogged and the unit must be dissassembled and cleaned. This appears to be a design flaw with all of these types of mosquito catchers.Fortunately, I purchased this unit from Costco and brought it back for a full refund no questions asked!"
2,Worked for 1 season,"Worked for 1 season, then just stopped catching mosquitoes.Not sure why, was cleaned and stored indoors over the winter, added a brand new propane tank, new attractant, and recleaned in spring."
1,get a can of Off instead!,This was given to us. We set it up. It caught 2 mosquitos overnight. We tried again. We gave it back. We had read all the bad reviews on it. We had to give it a fair shot for a few nights. NOT worth the money if you're planning on buying one.
2,doesn't work,caught two mosquitos in three daysI was getting eaten alive while trying to find out why it didn't work.
3,They fell apart after a year of great sound,"After about a year of owning these, they broke. The earphones fell off the headband, and were dangling there by a tiny cord. Originally I gave these a rating of a 5, but I feel that it is necessary to change that rating to a 3 now that they have broken. I have purchased a new pair of headphones from JVC which look sturdier, but don't have quite as strong of bass. Again, these have incredible sound, but you do have to be very careful with them. I didn't do anything really rough or unusual with them, they just fell apart."
3,Average,"I regret buying these headphones. I think I paid too much for it.Soundwise, it's ok. Nothing spectacular or mind-blowing. There's not enough bass to my liking and the treble seems too high.There's another model that has the volume control on the cable itself and that one costs less!It's comfortable, though. And the cord is pretty long.Other than that, I'd rather get the other models that are cheaper and have more features."
3,"Great sound and comfort, poor sound blockage","When I first got these out of the box I tried them on and plugged them into the stereo and promptly decided they're the best thing since sliced bread. However, after farther use I realized their single flaw... they let every single sound through. I've read that they may have been designed this way on purpose to avoid the effect that it sounds like you're in a tin-can and to avoid pressure problems with the bass when you have a tight seal with your ear. In this case I would strongly recommend them to anyone who will always be listening in a quiet place or wants to hear their surroundings, but they don't cut it for use in a car/bus, or if you're trying to block out surrounding noise as I usually am."
2,Not impressed.,"I purchased these headphones in hopes of finding an adequate replacement for my Klipsch Pro Media 5.1 system during the midnight hours...I was off target with these headphones. The bass is weak, they distort at fairly low volumes in my opinion, and they produce a very inaccurate reproduction of every note I pushed through them.Save your money and buy a higher-end pair of headphones."
3,Tom Jones - When I .... in love,"Not quite the experience I expected after revisiting these songs after 40 years.Some of the recording quality is poor.However, ""The nearness of you"" is still a standout."
4,As Promised,"Our furnace uses an odd size for filters which I couldn't find locally. I was pleased to find Filters-NOW through the Amazon.com website and very pleased to find that they had just the right size filter for our furnace. Delivered on time, as promised. Good job!"
3,Ummmmm,"I expected it to be a little more interesting...this sort of reminded me of that Stephen King mini-series ""Rose Red."" Had some scary parts, but it never really delved into the original history of the house. The first book was the same way...lots of important details missing. Average read...not so scary I couldn't read it at night."
1,Wow! This book stunk....,"Many of the facts were wrong and the photos were what I like to call ""edited for tv"". If you like your nonfiction to have at least a ring of truth(as most people expect)then this book isn't for you. All in all it left a whole lot to be desired."
4,A Dark Glimpse Of Death In Los Angeles,"Unflinching and sometimes disturbing. A focused look into the deadly past of the City of Angels that goes beyond the most famous murders, though the most prominent of those are given some additional exposure."
3,Fascinating book,"This book takes readers behind the scenes with the L.A. County Coroner's Office, revealing the details of some of the most notorious deaths of the twentieth century.Beginning with Wild West-era lynchings and turn-of-the-century mass-homicides in Chinatown, the authors demonstrate how the coroner's job has evolved into a state-of-the-art, multi-million-dollar operation responsible for cleaning up the 200 deaths that occur in L.A. every day. In addition to the science of death, Death in Paradise also examines the cultural and political atmospheres surrounding L.A.'s most infamous murders, suicides, and overdoses: from Barbara La Marr to Bugsy Siegel, the Black Dahlia to Marilyn Monroe, Janis Joplin to Bobby Kennedy.Interesting book but not enough decent picures."
1,Gruesom pictures? What gruesome pictures?,"Nothing in this book would be inappropriate for a 6-year-old to see. All the pictures were in black and white and NONE of them were gory. This book is just recycled stories we've all heard about dead celebs with a portrait of them included. It should be called ""My First Mystery Book"". Very disappointing."
2,Short and weak,"Really short, weak small B&W photos. Not that great. Got it from the library and was disappointed. Imagine if I'd bought it I'd be ticked."
1,False right from the get-go,200 deaths a day? I'm a Lieutenant for the LA County Coroner and I can tell you that there isn't anywhere near 200 deaths a day. Who are these authors? I've never heard of them!!! And how in the world did they get a book deal?
2,what's that saying? never judge a book by it's cover?,"well - you should. ""Death in Paradise"" was definitely not all it was cracked up to be. Some of the pictures were great while others were the same photos that everyone who's into this genre, has seen at one time or another. The factoid stories read like fluff & don't offer anything new or enlightening on those unsolved cases of yesteryear. It looks good on my coffee table though."
2,Factually flawed,"Based solely on the chapter dealing with the 1947 slaying of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, it's clear that the authors have not gained access to L.A. County coroner's office files (at least in this case) but have relied on news accounts and secondary sources. Without going into detailed debunking, it suffices to say that the Black Dahlia chapter is full of errors and is not to be trusted."
5,Amazing photography!! Art in motion,I loved the movie for a lot of reasons mentioned by other reviewers but the best part tis the photography. It is like watching a work of art in motion. I watched it twice for the photography. A must for all camera buffs :-)
4,Geniuses at work; great to share this with live audience,"This is great stuff. The only complaint I have is that Costello got a bit carried away here and there, overextending some frases. I learned to care about details, and these things can negatively affect the shape of the song. On the other hand, these are geniuses at work, and the video is just sensational. Please pay attention to how things fit together in the songs and arrangements -- how something that is alluded to over here appears again but changes into something else over there, and so on. It amazes me that the best music in the world seems to me so obviously as much an intellectual as an artitic project.If on the one hand it is a pitty that God Give Me Srength has not been included, on the other hand it is nice that the final credits come to the sound of Make It Easy On Yourself, and, as another reviewer mentioned, there is still a nice surprise after that."
5,the King scores again!!!,This is a way cool collaboration. Shortly before the taping of this sessions I had the pleasure of seeing EC&BB at Radio City. It was a one night concert and many of his (ECs) fans missed it. The video is a close second to the live show. Do not miss this one if you like cleaver intellegint lyrics and melodic orchestrations by two masters.
3,Good quality,It is good to know you can get this music digitally. We got this for some family members and then burned it onto a CD for them. It came out great.
4,Space Box - self-titled (Captain Trip),"Originally put out in 1981 as this was the short-lived Space Box's first effort. This just might be the former Guru Guru bassist's noisiest record ever. Tunes I dug the most were the noisy (but good) ""Zonk - Machine"", the Avant Garde ""Dapp-Da"", the fourteen-minute ""Tape Talk"", ""Bassomat"" and the jamming ""Ich Bin Suchtig"". Line-up: Uli Trepte - bass & vocals, Julius Golombeck - guitar, Edgar Hofman - harmonica & violin, Winfred Beck - conga & drums and Lotus Schmidt - drums. Really, not a bad CD - but again aimed toward the fan with an acquired taste."
5,Well done,"This is a very well done space video. You actually see the rockets taking off and people up in space. Other videos get distracted and go off into computer simulations or random things only sort of related to space, but this one is focused on the real life good stuff."
3,"OK, but not as good as ""Space Station""","IMAX movies always lose much of their visual impact on the small screen. The better IMAX DVDs make up for this with more substance: ""Space Station"", for instance, includes an extensive documentary and an informal video tour of the station by the astronauts themselves. Unfortunately ""Mission to Mir"" offers nothing along these lines (the brief ""behind the scenes"" feature is really just an extended trailer). Nor is the movie itself technically substantive: instead it harps on the political symbolism of both Russian-American cooperation after the Cold War (and to a lesser extent of the career of Shannon Lucid as a female astronaut). ""Mission to Mir"" isn't bad if you can get it cheap -- but as IMAX space movies go, ""Space Station"" is a much better choice."
4,Nike Triax Speed 10 Worth Buying,"I've had the Nike Triax Speed 10 for a month now and like its interface and performance. The controls took a little getting used to from my Timex Ironman. The digits are nice and large and the watch angle on the wrist makes for easy viewing. It's a cool looking watch (mine's all black). If I could make two changes, I'd make it a lot thinner and have a louder alram. Overall, I'm pleased."
2,"Some Good Ideas, but Repetitive and Long-Winded","There are some good ideas in this book, and a large variety of interesting references and historical anecdotes, but ultimately he is repeating himself over and over, and lacks the philosophical heft to properly reach his best conclusions. He should have applied Occam's Razor, in the same way he might have done as an engineer.May be a more interesting read for a non-engineer, or a passable speed-read skim, or for a reader more enamored with the expansive post-modern style of the ""non-fiction adventure"" that covers every recycled angle of the same concept."
1,wheel cover,Well the wheel cover did not work it came apart the first day that I used it. When I first looked at it on line there was no measurement as to what size of wheel it was actually for. So I got it and put it on unfortunately it tore and I had to get rid of it any way.
1,"Cute, but not usable","I've used multiple steering wheel covers in my 2005 Santa Fe and never have had a problem until now. This cover is adorable, but will not fit. I am incredibly disappointed as I had searched hard for a design I liked and bought seat covers to match as well. Now, I have to go without a matching set. What a great waste of money. I would have gotten a style I liked less just to have a set that worked for my car."
1,Crappy,Need to contact seller. This item is crappy. Cheaply made. Tried to install it on my steering wheel and it ripped. I want my money back.
2,"Cute, but ripped","1) Well, it's sitting on the steering wheel of my 2000 Dodge Neon, but it does have about a half-inch rip on the back of it, which I have tried to hide. I hope it lasts at least a year. 2) If you live in a warm climate, it will still be pretty hot to the touch, unfortunately. It has more of a vinyl-on-velvet feel. My hands feel grimy and dry after using it. Hopefully that will stop with more use."
4,Great product!,"This steering wheel cover is great! It looks exactly like the picture and is a thick, sturdy material. The only problem I have had with it is that it does not fit my steering wheel perfectly, so it slides around a bit. I have a Nissan Versa. But even that isn't much of a problem."
3,Okay but not great,It is a bit informative. It is rather easy to read but doesn't contain enough information on the pros and cons of the therapy and how it could potentially impact a patient.
5,Very Informative,"The book itself came in excellent condition. Although doing this diet would be a challenge, this is a very informative book, and provides an alternative in helping heal yourself through diet, which I believe is the main cause of illness besides the pollution we put into our air and water. I would only do this diet if I were majorly ill though, which I hope to never be."
4,Worth reading,It is so true that a person's diet is a culprit for many health issues of today. This book shows ways to help the body defend itself against these issues. It is worth reading.
1,the gerson therapy,"It seems to me that this Gerson therapy is a bit overboard. One has to find organic vegetables in such quantity that they can be juiced to produce 13 eight ounce glasses of juice per day and, of course, drink them. While resting from all this, one must take several coffee enimas. All this would hardly leave time to have a life, let alone earn a living as, I would guess, one couldn't get very far from a toilet."
1,Healthy Living & Coffee Enemas...,Fresh fruits and vegatables are always healthy. Coffee enemas are dangerous!
3,Satisfactory book but more narrative than quick-reference,"The Gerson Therapy is fantastic, and the bulk of inspirational videos and movies on the subject are very good. However, this book, despite its intent, is disorganized and without a quick-reference solution guide for each scenario (and for which, the Gerson Therapy proponents suggest there is). Provide the Gerson ""Rx"" clearly, specifically; good grief.If the author believes there is is a particular remedy for various problems, then it should be provided clearly, up-front and as an easy reference for the reader.Make this book a ""shake-and-bake"" receipe guide, and you'll have a functional product. As is, I really don't recommend this book. The printing was unimpressive as well; lighter than it could have been."
2,Could Be Dangerous Therapy,"This therapy is using a diet very high in potassium- including foods rich in potassium and supplements. If you have kidney disease high levels of potassium could be dangerous. Too much potassium in a normal person is potentially fatal. This diet and the therapy is akin to treating your body like a sponge, that absorbs nutrients, supplements, and then purges it all out, over and over. If you are looking for an alternative to cancer treatment try Dr. Burzinski. I believe Netflix has a documentary about his history of treating and curing cancers. I had no idea what this book was about. I was looking for a good vegetarian diet since I have kidney disease."
5,Never fear cancer again,"Want to take back your power to heal yourself without doctors, surgery or meds. Then pay attention to every word of this book and try it for yourself. It is time we stopped the drug companies and medical industry from ruling our lives via fear!"
3,OK but there's a Better Alternative Therapy,"I followed the Gerson Therapy for two years; my disease worsened the first six months and held stable for the next 18. AFter two years of perfect compliance, I didn't feel good and my disease hadn't regressed so I started the Gonzalez Therapy [...] which I learned about in Suzanne Somers' book Knockout. I learned the hard way that the Gerson Therapy is the antecedent to the Gonzalez Therapy and that the Gonzalez Therapy is much more effective. After four months on the Gonzalez Therapy, I have more energy than I've had in years and my cancer (multiple myeloma) is melting away. You can read my blog if you'd like to learn more [...]. Please feel free to contact me via my blog with questions. Good luck!"
3,Clearly self seeking at times,"I research this stuff for a living right now.. Years have been spent getting information... I have looked at this against research and I have found substantial current and legitimate scientific evidence that some of what is claimed is, in fact, possible. Although, I caution readers, that some do not turn around and it needs to be stressed. The cases that continue into progression are there, but without an actual study from legitimate institutions, an accurate turn around number is not available. I am sad to say, more conclusive studies are needed on mechanism and effectiveness before everyone can soundly buy onto it.. Some research has been done to show other affective foods. Yes, please eat healthy. It can work for some. I encourage you to do your own research."
4,Interesting thoughts,"I found this book to be an interesting read. I personally don't have cancer, but I am thinking of future situations, and would like to have as much knowledge as possible. I find that it always goes back to the Bible in the way you need to eat. All the books have the same answer, but in our society it is not appealing to eat fruits and vegetables and juice them unless we are dying."
3,Very Technical,This book is more for medically educated people. It's a bit hard to grasp some of the concepts for an average Jan like myself.
4,Gerson Therapy would be my first choice,This is not the first exposure I've had to the Gerson Therapy--I've also watched both videos on the subject. This book is well put-together and will walk you through most of the steps necessary to do the Gerson Treatments yourself. I would recommend it to anyone who is open-minded about treatment protocols that are not necessarily endorsed by the A.M.A.
5,Must Read for Natural Healing,"Excellent book detailing the procedures needed to cure numerous diseases (including cancer). Even if you're currently healthy you could learn a lot about staying that way from the information provided in the book... I also recommend Charlotte's book, ""Healing the Gerson Way."""
4,a book for all serious about health.,"This book tells it like it is, a book serious about health for all, if you have cancer or are at high risk of cancer, even if you are serious about health this book is for you, some parts of it are easy to follow but some parts are a little harder to do, its worth checking out for a better, healther way of life."
4,The Gerson Therapy,"This is a book with a recommended diet to help fight cancer. It is a bit extreme, but we knew it in the first place. We have not started the diet yet, but plan to start soon. This book was recommended to us and we will find out how helpful it is."
4,If only it were available here,"The ideas behind this seem wonderful. Bus as the treatment itself is not available in the States, it is sad that only those rich enough to travel and pay for the treatment outside the country could truly benefit. The book would get 5 stars, but loses one to the legalities of medicine."
4,Pretty Good,"I like this album, it includes a wide varity of songs fron the different operas. The sound quality is a bit like a record, which thew me off for a bit. If you like that sound then this is a good recording for, but if you want digital clarity this is not for you."
3,"OK, not great.","If you want to bake a fruit cake and it's nowhere near Christmas, sources of candied peel are few and far between. This was OK, but not great. The fruit part was fine, but it was mixed in with food coloring, high fructose corn syrup, and other chemical preservatives."
3,not bad,"This isn't their best work, but the whispers haven't made a bad one yet. The slow jams here are working."
5,TIMELESS!,"This album is dedicated to all the connoisseurs of fine wine and dine music. It contains an even share of sounds for the bedroom and the dance floor. Strictly for hardcore Soul/R&B fans. You wont be disappointed, i guarantee it! There is no absolute point for me to defend the songs and the vocals presented on this album, let your ears and your soul be the judge!"
1,"A Matter of Time? Yeh, time wasted.","It is rare that a novel is either so boring or stupid that I can not finish it. This book was both. Perhaps I couldn't get past the basic plot- Two hard-nosed inner city cops discover a murdered body who resembles an individual from 50 years ago. What conclusion do these officers jump to and investigate exclusively? Time travel. So with this underlying ridiculous plot, the novel delves into the troubled boring lives of the officers and two other mini-stories which will eventually undoubtedly involve the time traveling exploits of the victim and murderer. I got half way through this book and threw it into the trash. Don't waste your time."
4,It can't happen here .... can it?,"The ""editorial book review"" published by the state-run media that you see first on this page should be proof that Mr. Matsumoto is onto a dirty little secret in ""Vaccine A."" The idea that the Pentagon would expose tens of thousands of GIs to an experimental vaccine, and continue its testing despite evidence that the vaccine was defective, cannot be countenanced by the neoconservative elite. Thus the hit piece in the Washington Post. Please disregard.""Vaccine A"" is a well-balanced account of the development of an anthrax preventative gone awry. The book was extensively researched, and Mr. Matsumoto clearly explains in terms a layman can understand how the use of the adjuvant squalene (rhymes with ""sailing"") sickened thousands of Gulf War vets.This expose is must-reading for veterans --- and for parents of children who may be compelled to receive injections containing toxic ingredients such as mercury and/or squalene."
1,Squalene theory proved wrong,"Gary's idea that squalene caused gulf war syndrome has been debunked by many. Here is an example: ""Vaccination, squalene and anti-squalene antibodies: Facts or fiction?"" byGiuseppe Lippi a, Giovanni Targher b, Massimo Franchini. This article was published in European Journal of Internal Medicine ISSN: 0953-6205 Vol: 21 (2) 2010 Page: 70-73 Publisher: Elsevier. That's what happens when a journalist thinks he is a scientist."
2,"A fascinating subject, but a repetitive book","I had been waiting a year to find the time to read this intriguing book. However, having just finished it, I find myself dissatisfied and frustrated. While the subject is certainly interesting and one on which we should probably all educate ourselves, I found the book to be extremely repetitive. As a medical student, the science wasn't over my head but I caught myself skimming parts of the last 75 pages for new information that hadn't already been written about earlier in the book. Matsumoto says the same thing 400 different ways... the only part that drew me in were the personal stories scattered throughout the pages. Reading the book jacket is probably sufficient to tell you everything you'd want to know... I'm thoroughly disappointed."
2,"Decent sound and comfort, poor quality","Although the sound and comfort of these headphones are pretty good, a couple problems have marred my experience and I can't recommend them:1) The inline volume control is lousy. When I change the volume, sound in the speakers cuts in and out.2) The soft ""pleather"" material covering the earpieces is flaking off. Every time I use these headphones, I end up with black flakes on my face and in my hair around my ears."
4,Great sound for a reasonable price,"My son also has these, and when I told him I was searching for good headphones and looking at the Bose and others for $150 range, he convinced me to try these. Except for them being bulkier for handling when not using, they give great sound and are very comfortable. I wear them for 60 to 90 minutes at a time and have no discomfort."
4,fuzzy,after about a year or so of use most like every day the left speaker started going fuzzy.dont think they are suppossed to last forever but has this happened to others???cant beat the quality for the price .......what do you suspect for thirty dollars.i would buy them again.
2,they broke after 2 months,I purchased these headphones a little over two months and I was originaly pleased with my purchase and they had very good sound quality for the price but I took them on a basketball trip with me and on the bus ride back the left ear just stopped outputting music and now all the music comes out of the right ear it is no longer is stereo!! Now realize I this could be good for studio monitering or something of some such nature but since I do not mix music in a studio this is of very little use to me. Now i will admit i used this headphones quite heavily and sometimes the volume was loud but i was expecting alot more out of these headphones. So in conclusion if ur lookin for a set of headphones for a reasonable price that will last i strongly advise against it. but if ur not going to be too tuf on ur headphones then it might not be such a bad idea
2,Panasonic RPHT355 Headphone Review,"I purchased RPHT355 headphones for use in my cube at work, to replace my [amt] variety that did not kill background sound. I had hopes for at least an enjoyable experience.With the phones plugged into my Carver CT-Seven preamplifier, which drives my Sony Studio Monitor phones well, I was expecting a positive experience.What I got was a highly veiled thin response with little detail. Trying to get even a resemblance of flat responce from the headphones was challenging due to their non-linearity in resopnse.I listen to Jazz, Classical, 60's, 70's and 80's pop with some country mixed in. These didn't impress on anything. I went back to the [amt] guys."
1,High priced disappointment,"I was greatly looking forward to an occasional hot chocolate treat. This product smelled great dry. Once in water it had no chocolate aroma and was sickeningly sweet with almost no chocolate flavor. It also had some kind of whitish particles floating on top. I guess they were supposed to be ""foamy"" but they looked more like partly dissolved cornstarch or something. I won't drink anymore of it and feel I wasted my money."
1,Johnny R. does Jesus Rock,"Beware, while the music is nice and professionally played by the Rays, this isn't the Johnny Rawls of his previouw albums. First, it seems he doesn't play guitar on this one. Second, he didn't write the songs. Third, and worst, is many of the lyrics are what you'd hear on Jesus Rock stations. This isn't the good old badboy Johnny singing his catchy blues and jump blues songs about woman trouble, hot ladies, etc. and playing that great lead guitar with the tight band."
3,Total Calm is by Solaray costs less...,"""Total Calm"" by, Solaray costs less and has more mg. of Relora per capsule. It works because it lowers cortisol levels. You'll need to know what time your cortisol is high to make it work better. A naturopath can test your cortisol levels using a saliva test."
5,IT'S FINALLY WORKING!!!,"After 2 & a half weeks its finally working!!! I'm glad this was not a waste of money. It took a while for it to work but glad that it did. It's definitely suppressing my appetite which was a problem for me since im trying to lose weight. I take 2 pills a day, 1 in the morning and 1 around 2pm. I will be ordering another bottle today!!!"
4,Great Sleep Aid,"If I take 2 a day (one in the morning and one in the evening) I get too relaxed - so I tried taking it at night only and they have been great in helping me go to sleep and stay asleep. As far as appetite control, I haven't experienced that - but I love that I can now get a good night sleep."
5,Great Buy!,Item arrived early. Great packaging. Working great for my husband and I. Will purchase again from seller. This is our second bottle. We are seeing results in our weight loss goals. Experiencing no side effects.
1,Simply Didn't Work,This just did not work for me at all. I would never buy again as it just did not work for me. I wish it would have though.
1,Just doesn't work...,I am surprised by the high rating this product gets considering it didn't do a darn thing. I guess a lot of people are easily bamboozled. Save you money.
2,Meh and Bah,"Dr. Oz recommended, we used, no impact, but who knows if we missed something that many others seemed to have experienced. I do not recommend it; but I'm no Dr Oz..."
3,Not a miracle worker in this house...,"This might work well for other people, and obviously it does due to the great reviews, but I won't order it again. It didn't really seem to help with stress levels...it didn't decrease appetite and well quite honestly, it didn't seem to do anything. I found that Vitamin D-3 by the same company was far more effective in reducing stress and increasing a feeling of well-being. But that's just us..."
2,Not for me,"I like that this works and stops my cravings. It's also very relaxing and chills you out as other reviewers mentioned. Unfortunately this leaves me ""hungover"" the next day, it just saps my energy. I thought this would pass and continued using it for a few more days, sadly it just made me groggy so I stopped using it. So as much as I like that it does work, I just don't like it's side effects on me."
1,Relora,"This and other herbs (like Kava) have the opposite effect on me. They make me more anxious. Everyone's reactions can be so diverse to any herbs, vitamins or medications."
3,"Just OK, not as good as phosphatidylserine","Bought this for anxiety and cortisol assistance. There are better products for anxiety and the cortisol research is inconsistent. The product ended up making me kind of tired with some brain fog. In that sense it was good for anxiety, but not possible to take during a workday, when I needed it."
2,No change,"My stress levels haven't changed, or I should say, my physical well-being regarding stress hasn't changed and I haven't lost any weight. I never experienced any side effects, which is good. But I haven't experienced anything else either. I'm disappointed."
1,Made me more anxious and hungry,"I tried this product for a few weeks and it had a reverse effect on me. I was more anxious and more hungry. I then tried Relora with Diet Support, but unfortunately, experienced the same."
5,"VERY,VERY POWERFUL.THE'STEPPING RAZOR'AT HIS FINIST","Tosh's voice is in full flare, and the only let down about this album is the lack of more live tracks!Well worth the buy to any reggae fan, with the inspiration of JAH shining through"
4,Challenging & Fun,I really enjoyed this workout. It's challenging and fun in the same breath. Good music and energy. I recommend it to those who like switch up their routines. I'll probably try out another one of her DVD's. Good luck an enjoy!
1,CD does not work,"RegrettablyI bought several CD Sports and all work, but this CDHave tried in every way to run it, but unfortunately it did not workYou experience the DVD player CD player on the computer and all the same it does not work"
1,Horrible book!,"All Joyce Johnson does in this book is drop names about people she knew and complain that she was born in the wrong generation.Don't waste your money on this book. Just go to your nearest old folks home and hear about how they ""knew"" JFK. It's free and doesn't waste 5 hours of your life"
2,Breaks easy,"This shaker sure does look beautiful but it breaks really easy. I got it for a gift and had it for about 2 weeks before I used it and it fell over (on the counter) and shattered. Now, it may have been full of ice and the time (so really cold), but that shouldn't effect a martini shaker! I really think this kind of glass was made for looks and not function."
1,If I had only read the small print...,"I'd give this product the following, if I could.Beauty: 5Leak-proof: 5Wear and care: negative 2.I have a rule. If it cannot be on the top shelf of a dish washer, I won't buy it or use it. First wash, regular mode, away from anything that might jar it or clank against it -- and a shaker with a thickness of almost 1/2 inch just broke. I picked it up out of the dishwasher, attached the lid to it, and the bottom just fell out and down on my foot. Huh?Again, I should have paid attention to the fine print -- hand-washing recommended. Sorry, but I like my bar equipment squeaky clean, and hand washing just doesn't hack it.Again, considering the thickness of this shaker (and I was truly amazed), it still boggles the brain -- how could it have broken like that?????"
5,California adventure,This was an excellent DVD. My children and grandchildren enjoyed this fast paced beautiful California adventure with all the wonder that makes California a beautiful place to live or visit. From the soaring sky dancers to the beautiful redwoods this is a DVD to see. Watching how they photographed these sites was just as interesting. This DVD was purchased at Amazon.
3,Good idea imperfectly executed,"I picked these up as possible replacements for the Panasonic RP-HT850's, which apparently have been dropped from the line. Like the 850's they're true ""foldaway"" headphones--light, compact, comfortable, convenient to carry and wear. Unlike the 850's they use a two-sided, rather than a single-sided, cord connection, and they require insertion of a battery (which makes them marginally heavier). The sound is efficient, or responsive, and bright if not brilliant. But in side-by-side comparisons with my other headphones, including Panasonic RP-HT710's and Sennheiser PX-100's, the Panasonic 100's are definitely wanting in terms of balance, spaciousness, and fullness. If you don't mind the cumbersome size and 16-foot cord, the Panasonic RP-HT 710's are hard to beat for the price. Otherwise, the Sennheiser PX-100's are the inescapable choice--little overachievers that not only make the ride but hold their own against the more costly and conspicuous competition."
4,Excellent Buy,"When I first bought the headphones, I put them on and thought ""they sound great, but this is hardly what I call noise canceling"" and then I found I had to put in the included AAA battery and press the noice canceling switch. It makes a HUGE difference. It cancels out deep sounds, like the sound of a car engine, but unfortunately doesn't do anything to more normal sounds, like car radio or televisions. I can imagine these headphones would be most useful on an airplane where you would want to get rid of the engine sound. The more internal noise canceling is good too. Aslong as the headphones are on someones ears, the sound doesn't disturb others even at loud volumes. The bag they give you is excellent for taking along with you in your bookbag, and the headphones fold to fit into the small bag. And the headphones are very comfortable too."
3,Good performance at a decent price...not the best if you travel a lot.,"The noise reduction in these headphones is good, and they don't drain the battery fast. As long as the phones are fitted tight to your ear, the noise reduction works pretty well. If you travel a lot, like I do, you'd want a stronger headband than these have. The folding function is good, and they're compact when folded up and put in the included carrying bag. But when you travel a lot, like I do, the folding parts of the phones wear out pretty quick. The function still works well, but I'm trying to figure out a way to reinforce the headband so it clamps better to my ear. It's a bummer there's not a better midlevel, more durable folding noise reduction headphones that are at a midlevel pricepoint."
3,Fun video,"This video is great for the price. I exercise everyday. This video is not a very strenuous though, but it was fun and a nice change. They teach you a hula dance, she does a great job breaking down the steps. The landscape is beautiful!"
5,Love it!!,I just got this dvd a few days ago and i already fit my abs tighting. I love the fact that I am learning the hula and getting a workout at the same time. I recommended for people who have knee problem to not get this dvd. Hula is all about the hips and bending the knee.
4,New mom breaks sweat,I recently bought a bunch of cheap workout DVDS from amazon in hoping to lose some of my baby weight.This was one of them. I'm totally out of shape so I definitely broke a sweat. This is a great and fun (if you like to shake your hips) workout for beginners.I recommend it if you are looking for something simple.
1,Bad! Don't buy this dvd,"Wow, this is a really terrible dvd. The filming is bad, the moves are rediculous, and the pace is for the elderly. I'm glad I got this used at a low price."
5,enjoyable DVD!,"I really like the Island Girl series. So much that although I odered 2, I have just ordered the other two!This is low impact, with great drumming, and the women (Kili and the background dancers too) look so strong! I love the sound of thunder in the background.Basically she teaches you a not too complex hula dance, slowly and surely, with added toning movements. It is a half hour DVD and the time flies!I reccommend this highly!"
2,rough video,"I did not like this video at all. It was too rough, not the soft hula I am used to. Seems like it was combined with a hard rock sort of dance."
2,Too much fluff,It took too long to get to the meat of the video. Too much time was wasted. It went too slow. I like to get right into the exercise without all the fluff.
3,"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,",NOT ENOUGH EXPLAINATION AND SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED MORE HAWIIAN MUSIC I AN DISABLED AND CANT WALK FOR LONG PERIOND. THE DR SAID I NEED TO STRENGHTEN MY CORE. I JUST DON'T SEE THID DOING THID
3,Not exactly what i was looking for.,I thought this would be a fun way to lose some weight but after watching the DVD it's definitely not what i had in mind. It would be a fun way to learn how to hula dance but not really the kind of workout I need.
4,We're loving it,"I ordered this dvd for two reasons...one I need to lose some weight and have fond memories of my trips to Hawaii two because I thought it would be fun to do with my 7 yr daughter who loves the hula dance scene from Lilo and Stitch, loves to dance and we could do it together. We love the dance and the music in it and I'm very happy I ordered and wish I would have thought of it sooner."
4,Hula Abs & Buns,"Enjoying the workout! I'm a little computer challenged, so locating the actual workout was a chore. Video arrived in great condition."
5,This house is soooo fun!!!!!!!!,I bought two of these for my 13 and 8 year old daughters. They absolutely love them!!!! I think these houses are great for any age. I would enjoy one and my great grandma wants to get one for her sister who is in her 80's. My 13 year old put the two houses together with the help of her little sister in about 45 minutes. They have been creating completely different styles from one another and are both in heaven! The only thing I would recommend is not getting it for a child that is too young because they are made to handle with care. (Not really for playing) just designing....I WANT ONE!!!
1,DON'T BUY,This is the worst item I have purchased for my daughter for her birthday. The instructions they provided were very vague and not helpful at all. They provided pieces to decorate the doll house but they don't explain how to go about it. Then theres pieces they give you that your not even sure what they are for (like dough and string). The assembly of this house is very poorly made and falls apart easily. The one we purchase advertised real electrically working lights but they didn't provide the means to achieve this. I would have taken this item back to the store but it was to far to travel to return it. Luckily we didn't pay to much for it because it wont be long before it will end up in the trash.
4,"Neverending music, or neverending nightmare?","This music CD I bought is not too far from wonderful, but I can't believe they changed everything and didn't add the actual Ivory Tower music, did they? It's a good thing that they put in most of the music from the film, I was wondering if one of these days they would simply add the ""final flight to the ivory tower"" part, even near the end with the nothings darkness everywhere and Atreyu in the beginning saying ""look Falkor, it's the ivory tower!"" it still would sound sweet! Then the opening credit music would rock! How hard could it be?Btw, I grew up in the 80's when this movie was new and I am a true fan, still some 23 years later."
5,die unendliche geschichte ... the neverending story,"i have seen the movie about a lot of times and i love it so much... the soundtrack has an important influence to this...because it is so wonderful... but what i have never known is, that giorgio moroder has composed a few tracks. i know that he's responsible for the soundtrack of neverending story part II. i have a german version of the original film music and it is all written by klaus doldinger!!! i don't understand now..."
4,"Great, But Keep well","The reason why I say this, is because, once scratched, even a tiny bit,it will cost you another CD.But otherwise noted it's one of the best music's I have ever listened to.If you buy one keep in good shape."
3,Good but a variety of sizes would be best,I love these book rings. They come in handy for so many different things. This item would be so much better if the distributer sold a box of 100 rings in several different sizes.
1,Maybe should have been a juicer,"I purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it. I already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly. I don't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running. You have to constantly shake it to get it going again. Obviously a manufacturer error. I must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at. My kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute. But, it just didn't work."
3,Cute but with design issues,"This was the cutest humidifier I've ever owned, and while it certainly humidified well, it has a persistent design flaw with the water level indicator which would constantly turn off the machine even when there was plenty of water in the tank. In the end I glued the thing in place, which meant I no longer had any sort of run-dry cutoff and had to manually monitor it. You also cannot turn off the incredibly bright nightlight, which can be distracting. Still, cute as hell."
3,Nice but fragile,"Helped us to improve the aim, but is very fragile ... It has broken 3 of the 6 that i bought, in the part that holds the tail."
2,Item sent was not item ordered,"Received ""plain wrap"" darts that came in a small white envelope. I intentionally ordered the ones in the photo (with Union Jack on them)."
3,Flight keep comming off,Overall the darts are fine and the weight is good but the flights keep falling of so I had to use masking tape to stick them on.
3,Good Dorm Swag,I am a college student that just wanted some Buckeye gear. It is cheaply made but it looks good in a dorm. I do not think it would last long if it was outside.
4,Vacation Getaway,"This was a good end to the six original Trixie Belden books. The change of scene (a dude ranch in Arizona) was refreshingly different, as was the mystery. The interactions among the characters are one of the book's (and series') big strengths, as is Trixie's irrepressible spirit. Still, I sometimes felt that when the author created the Bob-Whites, she burdened herself with having to carry a whole cast of characters around, into each book, giving each of them space and dialogue and action. This encumbered books 4-6 a bit: the mystery and action were sharper and more focused in the first three books. The entire series of six, however, is excellent: very worth reading!"
4,"Short but sweet, in its own way","Though this was my first time reading Val McDermid, I was already a fan. Her books are the basis of a great British crime drama, Wire in the Blood, and as soon as I discovered that all of her books found a spot on my wishlist. This was just a novella, but I think it's a good taste of what McDermid can do. The story opens at the scene of the brutal murder of Katie Farrell, who has been burned to death in her own bedroom. Katie is the daughter of Jack Farrell, an organized crime boss that DCI Andy Martin refers to as a ""cleanskin"", meaning he has no criminal record. The story follows Andy as he tries to figure out who would dare to kill Jack Farrell's daughter. I found the writing to be tight and the suspense level appropriate. Though there were some plot twists that weren't exactly unexpected, the final outcome was not something I would have guessed. I can't wait to read something more fleshed out and developed from McDermid."
