4,Truly Better Than Chocolate,"I recently purchased this CD to tide me over 'till the movie became available on video, and I loved it. Peter Outerbridge's ""drag queen"" bit was hilarious, and Ani DiFranco's song was intense and thought-provoking. A truly wonderful, romantic CD to share with a loved one."
1,Do not buy this book,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read (well, I have only read the first 4 chapters and do not want to continue). It is not just boring, disorganized, and full of errors and inconsistencies. Its biggest problem is that it discourages thinking and real understanding. Don't be fooled by the long lists of various kinds of problems at the end of each chapter. Their sole purpose appears to be turning your brain into a robot. The materials covered by the book are not difficult at all from a mathematical point of view (I have a background in theoretical physics) but the authors managed to make them hard by giving bad explanations or no explanation. If your goal is to memerize some rules and pass exams, you might like this book. However, if you can think and actually want to learn something, do not buy this book."
2,Lots of Graphics - Islands of Clarity,"This book could have been a good book if the authors had placed more effort on writing clarity and presentation of the mathematical concepts with graphic illustrations that solidified the concepts. Too much space is devoted to non-instructive graphics. The examples are sometimes too simple for the material, leaving the really difficult concepts to be learned by the reader working through key problems at the end of each chapter. A great book for homework problems. A poor book for teaching concepts. The trendy use of signal flow graphs was unfortunate."
2,Tedious Tome,"This was the textbook for a control theory course I took as an undergraduate. It's hard to believe this text is so popular (9 editions!) since it is so tedious, delving unnecessarily into minute details of simple problems (PID controllers, e.g.) while ignoring the mathematical foundations of what is really a beautiful subject."
1,Makes a nice paper weight,"That book was required for my course, and that was the $150.00 I wish I spent on something else. It still looks like new, because I almost never reffered to it. I found better explained info on the internet. I flanked the course the first time, then I found othe sources of information. Never, EVER buy this book, mine is alredy in the garbage."
4,Más de lo mismo,"Si, es un album doble, pero sucede lo mismo de siempre, son prácticamente las mismas canciones de todos los albumes de recopilación de Nicola di Bari. La discografía de este artista es muy vasta, sus éxitos son muchos, ¿porqué en un album doble no existen otras canciones?Los fans de Nicola estamos condenados a tener 10 o 20 albumes que en total tengan 30 o 40 canciones de él, ¿y las demás?Este album enriquecería mi colección con dos canciones.Propongo que se edite una colección de Nicola di Bari en 5 o 6 CDs sin repetir canciones como en México han hecho con artistas como Juan Gabriel y José José.Pero para quien quiere descubrir a Nicola Di Bari, este es uno de los mejores albumes, y para ellos la recomendación de que lo compren inmediatamente...¡no se arrepentirán!"
5,i hate country but love hank,what a cd i am a huge van morrison fan and bob dyland and neil young and so on and so on they are influenced by this man and he rules country music sucks so bad i hate it but this isnt country to me its music so emotional so true no strings attached its heartfelt music by a genius i love van paul rodgers jim morrison springsteen and hank is up there he rules what a cd go hank best song angel of death then im so lonesome i could cry he was the man
5,Brings back memories,I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. She loved it. This was a wonderful collection of Hank's music that you will enjoy.
5,"""For the new Hank Sr. fan , this is what you need""","Back in the 60's a nice two record set of Hank's top hits came out and I had a friend that owned the set. I borrowed it and made a good recording on 7 in. reels with my then Akia-reel to reel recording deck. This CD set carries most of the songs that were on that double LP set. I think that this CD set is ""Great"" for the person who wants to get some of Hank's basic stuff, but after visiting a music store and seeing a set that I didn't know existed called ""The Complete Hank Williams/10 CD box set"" I made up my mind that for a true Old Time Collector of ""REAL"" Country music like myself this set is the only way to go! The 2CD set that this review is about is exceptional and has a lot of Hank's Favorites and if you are looking for some good basic stuff from Hank -buy it- But I have my sites set on the Big Box and as soon as I pick it up I'll be sure and give you all an honest review on that set also ! ""ENJOY"""
3,I needed something that would work on inexpensive LED flashlights I bought for our parking lot crew.,"These wands weren't designed for the flashlights I purchased, but I was able to attach them and they work fine and are brighter than our original wand lights."
4,Wanna Feel Good?,"If you want music that touches your soul and gets you dancing, this a great CD to listen to. As a fan of Techno/Trance/House & Drum & Bass, this is a great CD. Enjoy!"
3,The Software Engineering Approach,"As you noticed, a lot of the reviewers for this book are people who already know C++. I found this to be a great software engineering book, giving a lot of good tips for being a good software engineer. However, if you are looking to learn C++, find another book. This book will be frustrating because it will be hard to find the C++ concepts lost among the tips on how to be a good software engineer. Also, it would not be a very good reference book either because the guy is constantly referencing jokes he made earlier in the book as explanations for why things are done as they are."
1,All over the place,This book is very hard to follow. The author shows you many examples and at the very end (after you think you're beginning to understand) states not to code like this. Doesn't give many examples backed with reason for good code technique. The writer also tends to be a little scattered. I would recommend the Dietel & Dietel C++ book.
2,"This guy writes decent, but braggs so much",The book would be ten times better if the author does not put on almost every page why his books are way better than the other books. He emphasizes this too much and makes us think that his opinion only counts. The book is sort of easy to follow and has some great examples in it as well. I wish he had some exercises especially for us college students. But sometimes he gives us too much examples which is pointless like learning how to program with Global variables. The book does not come with a CD as well that should come with programs that us users should follow and show us how they work. But I only read a couple of chapters and so far the book is just plain okay. The guy just braggs and too full of himself.
5,Chinese Dragon coin necklace,Very pleased with my purchase. Is a nice piece and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The leather string is adjustable in length.
5,perfect gift,i love this neckless ! i bought it for my boyfriend for our six mounth. and i owed him a gift gor his birthday and christmas :/ and saw this neckless and it compltetly makes up for all the gifts i owe. its very fancy looking and sturdy :) totally recommend this to any gal whos looking for a kool gift for thier boyfriends.
2,Difficult to use,"I purchased this book specifically because it had a CD, and I thought it would help with a computerized test. You must write down your answers to compare it with the answer explanations. Fortunately the test in the book are the test on the CD. It makes checking somewhat easier. Unfortunately this means you only have 2 review test instead of 4. I will be buying another book simply because I feel unprepared. I would not recommend it."
4,need to take a Praxis? This is the book id get,"I just took my praxis exams this morning, and if I didn't use this book, I would have been a little lost. It has everything you could think of is preparing for this test, and when you have completed all tests and toward finishing college and looking for a job, this book's last section shows how to pump up your resume and gives you tips when looking for a job.If you are in the education major, Id recommend this book, it will take you far in your higher education and beyond."
1,misrepresentation of product and damage of packaging,"The rosary i ordered was close enough but i was HIGHLY disappointed in the green velvet box it came in. You advertised a box with the statement ""St Patrick"" on it, which is my fathers name. The box i ordered opened sideways and was inscribed. The box i received opened the wrong way and the company name was poorly written on the inside. The rosary didnt even hang right in the box. I was very excited about this gift for him and it completely ruined the ambience of the gift.Very disappointed.Also, the white box surrounding the velvet box was damaged and torn so it made the gift look cheap, which is was not, and it scratched the velvet.In future if you are going to advertise something pretty enough to catch someones eye, don't break their heart by smashing it in the wrong box, with the wrong inscription and no explanation"
2,Change Is Not So Good,Used to have 'sea salt' and now just 'salt'.Still crumbly. Traces of sesame seed.New packaging is nice but I don't eat packaging.
2,Crackers Were Burned,"This order of crackers was burned, the entire case! The tops of the crackers were falling off because of it.If you like burned crackers, then these are for you.The price has also increased. Let's see now, burned crackers, super high price. Do you really want to purchase this item?Where oh where is Susie and quality control?"
5,Still the best work on Nullification,"Despite the fact that this was first published in 1965, Freehling's work is still the source for the Nullification Controversy. To be sure, the book is at times tedious and because of the nature of nullification, at times it is very theoretical, but if you want to learn about nullification and the crisis that occurred because of it, read this book. I've read reviews of Freehling's other work where people complain of his writing style, but I thought this book actually read very well and Freehling explained things in a very concise, easily understood manner. At times, I must admit I found it hard to keep the theoretical aspects straight or all the players who were involved, but after reading this book, you will come away with an understanding of the nullification crisis."
1,worthless,2 out of 3 leaked ink when I received the package. I paid1 cent plus shipping for it. I guess you get what youpaid for.
5,Delightful for All Ages,"This is a toy for all ages. I'll be the first to admit I still like stuffed animals, and I've always liked dinosaurs. The Fuzzy Fella raptor is VERY soft, cuddly, and remarkably accurate (at least according to current scientific speculation). I cannot attest to the durability of the plush, as someone my age won't really put a stuffed animal through the paces the way a child will. A great gift for children (both young and young at heart) who love dinosaurs."
2,This is not Gore-Tex,apparently there is an error in the item description. these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive. I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway... stupid me.
3,Copy of a ND (Nippon Denso) Plug,Accel plugs are no more than a copy of an Nippon Denso (ND) Spark Plug. The insulator is yellow and that's the only difference.
4,"training, history, breeding, care","Details training the GSD, from socialization to advanced training. History, breeding, care."
5,"Soulfull, Acoustic, Lyrical","Marc has a light uplifting voice that shows his soulfull feeling through the album. I am yet to see him live, but i cannot wait to get the chance. The strings on a few of the songs are a great choice, and other additions like this show that he is not a cookie cutter type artist. I gave this because i ordered it thinking it would be something i could put on in the backround and enjoy, and when i got it i found that i didn't do any work while i was listening, i just sat there and listened to his acoutic lyrical sound. Excellent."
4,Talented artist shines with his debut...,"Two minutes into playing this album, you begin to realize just how good a musician Marc Broussard really is. Three songs later, your estimation jumps again. This album is one of those rare debuts where the pure talent and songwriting outhsines the promise of a new artist. Marc Broussard's debut album Momentary Setback is a great album from an artist that we will be hearing more from in the future.Broussard's voice ranges from jazzy to bluesy to pure New Orleans. It is a voice that instills the music with energy, a hard task considering the incredibly talented musicians playing on this album. Listen to French Cafe, which purely on words alone is a bit weak, but Broussard turns into a ode to love. The Prayer, Jeremiah, and the Wanderer are all outstanding and there is truly not a bad song on this album. Well worth the purchase."
4,Oh My God!!!,"I had the pleasure of discovering Marc at a Gavin DeGraw concert and ever since the moment he burst onto stage, I've been hooked. Although I was just able to buy this cd, I have now seen him perform almost every song on the cd live and let me tell you, while the CD is AMAZING, seeing Marc live is even better. Buy the cd, and his newer release Carencro, then go see him live. There's no one out there right now with as much talent as Marc has."
5,Almost as special as Carencro!,"I got Carencro first, and was blown away. Now I have Momentary Setback, and I love it too. Marc sounds fantastic and the songs are all ""keepers"". Marc is an incredible talent, he deserves much more recognition than he has. Will add to my daily listening."
5,AMAZING!!!,I saw him live in Houston when he opened for Maroon 5. I had no idea who he was at the time. Marc is amazing...his voice and lyrics will move you.
3,Just one episode...Please!,"I like this show and the personalities, but can only watch it if I'm in the mood to. As in in the mood for watching someone stick their hand up a cows butt. Really, a little variety would be nice. Cut back on the butt exams on the episodes. ick"
5,show needs more episodes please,GREAT Show!!Amazing VET wish there was a commons sense VET like dr pol in my area.The show is a down to earth family show. IT is nice to see a family businessdoing so well. Small business are the backbone of America. I know from experiencemost modern vets do not treat the animals as quickly when there is an emergency or the charge so much vet care is actually high the people medical care. A normal vet practice does not respond to emergency at all they are just not available. Watch the show and make your own decision. I do not believe you will regret watching.
1,Incredibly horrible,"The best example of poor quality veterinary medicine that I have ever seen. Please everyone out there, be aware that this is not the standard of care that most vets practice."
1,An uninspiring translation,"I wanted to be transported to ancient Finland, with a beautiful and dignified rendering of the Kalevala. Instead, this version is full of modern, slangy English idioms, like ""You've got it made.""And the repeated use of the word ""wench"" instead of a more poetic rendering, for instance ""girl"" ""maiden"" ""serving maid"" or ""handmaiden"" or even just plain ""woman"" or ""young woman"" would have been far better. I'll be selling this copy and buying one of the older translations of the Kalevala.Don't bother with this one unless you want a very modern read---and I don't mean that in a good way---with all the magic sucked out of it due to an uninspired translation.Thoroughly lacking."
5,The Finnish Folks Epic,"The folk epic of Finland will immediately have one source of familiarity to the English reader. Longfellow utilized the rhythmic scheme for Hiawatha. This wonderful story of - steadfast old Vainamoinen, Lemminkainen and Ilmarinen, with stories of everything from the creation of the world, to courting the daughter of the gat-toothed dame of sedgy northfarm, to the loss of the magic sampo must simply be read to be believed. You are taken into a world of shamans and will meet the prototype for Tolkien's Tom Bombadil. Read it and enjoy."
2,"Great story, too-literal translation","I first heard about the Kalava in middle school when I wrote a term paper about Finland, and learned that its poetic meter was copied by Longfellow when he wrote ""The Song of Hiawatha."" Recently I ran across it again while doing research on mythology, and decided to actually read it this time. The stories are fascinating, and now I know where Tolkein (a great favorite of mine) got some of his ideas! However, the translation was disappointing. I think the author was trying to be as true to the original as possible, but the result is clunky and not at all poetic. For instance, every time someone speaks, it says, ""he/she declared, chattered,"" which sounds more like a cocktail party than an epic poem! Finally I purchased a different translation which preserves the original meter, and found it much more readable. I've kept this one for reference in case I want to know the literal meaning of a passage."
2,Disappointed,"I wish I had paid better attention and reviewed the inside of this book before making my purchase. The rythm of the story is all wrong. I liked the older versions of the Kalevala. I am truly disappointed. I will keep the book for my collection, but I am definitely going to need to make sure I purchase the correct version of the Kalevala I enjoy."
5,I didn't have to push myself through this.,"I enjoyed this epic story of Finnish mythology. It was a musical, delightful collection of heroic stories that didn't overwhelm me. I could keep track of the characters and what they respresented quite easily.I was delighted by this book! I hope all Finnish children are exposed to the exciting yet fun depiction of their mythological heritage.I know that scholars want to read everything and disect the stories for deeper meanings -- which is just fine -- but I can really see this as a set of stories being told to small children while the whole family sat around the fireplace."
5,Great Music that speaks to the soul.,"Being the debut album for The Praise Project, I was very suprised at the depth and breadth of this CD. I have listen to it time and again as it speaks to my soul."
4,"Simple, lucid, accurate","This book was a splendid exposition of alchemy, aimed to be a primer to the art. It explains the phases, history, and barebones concepts of the royal art. It builds up to a small treatise on spagyric tinctures, so that the reader can explore first hand alchemical processes within the context of outer alchemy, using plants to connect with planetary forces."
4,Great features unless you want a chronograph function,"I bought this watch thinking it had a chronograph function. However, aside from not having that, everything else is great about this watch. The heart rate monitor isn't too uncomfortable, and will be easy to adjust to for women who are used to wearing sports bras during exercise, anyway. If you're looking for a chronograph function, where you can record times for laps, don't get this watch. It just has a simple timing function, which goes either up or down. Other than that, this is a great watch, and I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for an inexpensive heart rate monitor combined with a functional sports watch."
2,"Great watch, bad chest strap design","I own this exact watch. The chest strap broke after 6 months of use. The replaceable battery is nice if the rest of the unit holds up, but it didn't. If it wasn't for that, I would be very enthusiastic about the Timex heart rate monitors. This review applies to most Timex heart rate monitors, as they all use the same chest strap."
3,Timex HR Monitor,I wouldn't get this brand again. The monitor only worked for about a year and a half or so. I've had others last twice that long or longer.
1,What a waste of $,"I too have had trouble with the sensor finding my heart rate. And yes I have wet the sensors and moved it around and even tried it w/ different bras thinking they might be interfering with the way it sits on my torso - to no avail. It worked great for the 1st month or two, and then just stopped. I will be doubled over trying to catch my breath in a high intensity interval training session and the heart rate monitor reads my heart rate at 42! then out of no where it jumps up to 170 and at random can't find my heart rate again. there seems to be no correlation on what exercise i'm doing. Congrats to those who got one that works, but there seems to be just too high a percentage that you'll get one like the rest of us who got lemons. (i couldn't return it as i did not have a receipt - it was a gift).. I will get a Polar like everyone else I know and who have never had these issues."
5,It is the best book you will erver read!,"From Redwall Abbey to Salamandastron, the evil weasel assassin Ferahgo will change every creature's lives. From the great treasure hidden inside Salamandarston to the legenary sword of Martin the Warrior. It is the best book that you will ever read"
5,Salmandastron is definitly another great Redwall book!,"Salamandastron is on heck of a name, just right for one heck of a book. Every Redwall book keeps me dying to turn the page, but this one especially!!! I recomed this action packed novel to anyone who enjoys enjoyable books that are nice and long. Beware: don't get attached to Klitch the ""friendly"" weasle at the beginning of the book. Remember that!"
5,This is my favorite Redwall novel!!!!,"This is THE greatest novel Brian Jacques has written in the Redwall series! It features the badger Sunflash the Mace, son of Bella of Brockhall. He, after being lost as a child, grows up in the woodlands. After a conflict with Swart Sixclaw, Sunflash journeys to Salamandastron, the mountain home of hares and badger lords. Sixclaw also comes to Salamandastron, where he fights with Sunflash, and the hares of the Long Patrol. This exciting story can be read again and again! A definite 5 star story!"
5,I loved it!!!,"I had heard a few people talk about this Redwall series but I'm not usually to easy to please. After the first few pages I could tell this was not just another volume in any old fantasy series. This was awesome!I mean, any book that can make you believe and care about rodents in an abbey in the middle of nowhere has got to be something special. This was the most vivid, descriptive, engrossing book I had ever read. It was finished in short order. Needless to say, I now buy every Redwall book that comes out.The feasts, the battles, and especially the characters just leapt right out at me. I told a few of my friends about this amazing series and I can't think of a one who wasn't hooked. This was the only literary universe I had ever found myself wanting to escape to. The school library had multiple reservations on every book available! If that's not reason for praise, then I'm not sure what is."
3,Worst Book in the Redwall Series,"While I don't think that this is by any means a terrible novel, I was particularly underwhelmed by the plot inertia and relatively unrelatable characters who never really found themselves in any massive crises that caused me to care about them until late in the novel."
5,I Loved it!,"This is the first book out of Brian Jacques series that I have ever read. I continued to read the others in the series but I always came back to this one. I think it was because the story was so touching, so heroic, and it left an imprint in your mind about how morals and loyalty should be kept."
5,"Wonderful! A VERY sad ending, but wonderful!","It's not one of the best Redwall novels, but it's VERY good. The part I didn't like was that vermin wielded Martin's sword for most of the book (same dislike about Martin the Warrior). Mr. Jacques has done better, but overall, I LOVED this book!"
5,The Best Book In The Mossflower Series,"Salamandastron is my favorite book in the whole library. You simply cannot put it down. Ferahgo the Assassin wants the legendary Salamandastron all to himself, but first he has to defeat it's number one problem. Urthstripe the mighty badger lord of Salamandastron!!! While that is going on on one side of Mossflower, the mice at the abbey are trying to cure a dangerous, deadly fever that has almos all the abbymice in the infirmary. While still another adventure is going on. An otter ""Thrugg"" and a baby doormouse are off to the mountains to find the cure for this fever. The Icetor Flowers, which are heavily garded on one of the highest mountains in Mossflower, by a very hungry Eagle!!! This is one of those books that makes you jump up and down for joy when you finish the last page!"
3,Deux Ex Machina (And I know it's misspelled),"The first time I read this book, I was in seventh grade. I reread it in tenth, and found many major flaws in what I had previously thought a terrific book. Urthmight and Urthwhite's grandmother wasn't introduced until the end, when the mountain needed saving. If you've ever studied writing, this is calles 'Deux Ex Machina' or 'God in Machine'. It fixes a terrible mistake, or a bunch of mistakes. And of course, they get there just in time."
3,dont get me wrong i love redwall books but this is the worst,"i love redwall but this book was terribly ilisstated and besides samkin,urthwyt, the characters sucked i recomend reading mossflower,outcastof redwall,mattimeo,redwall,long patrol and all the other redwall books before this one"
3,its an ok read,The book of fantasy was ok... Cause brian jaques used animals as symbol's of people with many diffrent culture's and style's its ok if you totally need a reading book. So that's about it...
4,High Action Novel!,The thing that I just love about this book is the high action and the constant battles. The book keeps you on your toes. Salamandastron was very enjoyable to me but has a lot of plot and a lot of things going on at the same time!
5,Absolutelyballyspiffinhunkydory!!,"Wot a spiffin good book o' adventure! I wouldn't kid an' ol' chap, and anyone who reads this hunky dory review is no bally exception. It starts with an' ol' gel, a badgermaid, who leaves the good ol' mountain Salamandastron. (Under the supervision of a young ol' chap like me, righto!) But corks, she's got one bally heck of an adventure ta do if she wants to defeat...oh, corks...Ferahgo the assassin,wot,wot! Oh corks meself, all I can bally well say is that the only thing she can bally well do is enlist the help o' some jolly good eggs, the Redwallers, but I'm gonna be jolly well late for me lunch back at the good ol' mountain, so I might as well give ya a jolly good hint...this story's the absolutely bally spiffin hunky dory best! Euuuuulaliiiiiaaaaaa!"
5,Excelent Book,"Salamandastron is a great book. a Page turnig adventure. Brian Jaques' fans will rejoyce with this tale of courage, and strength. I recomend you read this book and Enjoy it"
4,This is a GREAT book!!,"This book is GREAT. I really think you should read it, especially if you like the Redwall series. Salamadastron is not as gory as many of the other Redwall books, but it does still have it's gory parts that might scare younger kids."
5,Salamandastron By Brian Jacques.,"I thought this book was really fastinating,adventurouss and full of action. What I mean by fastinating is it is full of thoughts and it would keep you on the edge of your seat.The adventourous part is that the characters never stop adventuring into new places,they always meet new people and get themselves into trouble.The action part is in the second part and third part there are alot of battles that will never bore you.What I liked about it is full of feelings and thoughts.The thought of being able to see what is happening in your head.What I didn't like about it is that it kept switching back and fourth from character to character,in the part of each chapter.I would recommend it to all the grades in this school,because that age group has to like action and adventure books like me and my friends."
5,A Well Written and Thoroughly Finished Book,"Salamandastron is an excellant novel that has great descriptions of characters, places, thoughts, and emotions. Also, it has many places at once where different things are happening, yet it still doesn't get confusing. I can reccomend Salamandastron to anyone who has read books in the redwall series and enjoyed them, because this is book--the fifth--is one of the best. I especially enjoyed the way Brian Jacques had a little mousbabe go with the Icetor, and made it all come at once in the ending. This book is well written, and you should add it to your collection straight away!"
5,"Burr, hurr this'n is a good'n, burr hurr","This is a good book, and it should be read over and over. I loved the detailed descriptions of the characters, especially Ferahgo and Klitch. One of my all time favorites. Humorous, serious, wonderful. I just can't emphasize that enough. WOW!!!!!!!"
5,"I would rate this 1,000,000 if I could.","I think this is the best Redwall book out of all. It is full of the battle, adventure, happines, sadness, and excitement that all books in the Redwall series should have. You never get bored reading it. It's the perfect book for fantasy and medival lovers."
5,Eulaliaaaaaa! One of the best in the series!,"Mr. Jaques has done it again! This book was great! I have read most of the series and they're all really good. If you are a fan of the Redwall series, then you should read this book and add it to your collection. Salamandastron had a great plot, and it kept me hooked to the end. Mr. Jaques made it feel as if you were really there with fun characters, suspense, and surprises. He is the only author I know that can write whole pages about food! I would also recommend reading Mattimeo and The Bellmaker, because those were equally good."
4,The Best Book Ever,"Salamandastron is the third book of the Redwall series I've read and loved it a whole lot. All the brand new good guy characters and the bad guy characters that the book introduced. The best conflict that I liked is when Martin's sword was stolen and Samkin and Arula went after those weasels that stole it. The chase was an awesome thing to read about and when Samkin met Spriggat, Alfoh, and his army of shrews. When they met up with Log-a Log and his shrews and when Samkin finally got back the sword I was really happy. When they went to Salamandastron to defeat Ferahgo and his bandits of weasel I new it was going to be an awesome battle. After that exciting fight at Salamandastron they had a great feast at Redwall when they returned with Martin's sword. I'm also glad that Redwall got a new badger queen. I am reading other of your books and please keep on writing!Sincerely,Daniel Scot McCarthy"
4,A Good Read!,"I hate to be a damp rag, but this book really seems like it was wrote halfheartedly. Urthstripe? Urthwyte? I mean, come on, you're going to need better names than that if you want to write a book. Though Urthstripe and Mara both seem wishy-washy and poorly defined, the other characters more than make up for what those two lack.Even though Salamandastron did not lve up to my expectations, I would feel terrible if I gave anything less than 4 stars to any of Brian Jacques books. Brian Jacques is a masterful writer, with the ability to keep the reader engrossed in even the worst of his many books."
5,My kid just loves the dvds,"My kid just loves the dvds. His fav is Nature, he has progressed so muchafter watching the dvds about 3-4 times."
5,Too Funny!,"Jim's humor is hillarious and we've waited a long time for a new DVD from him. It's a shame that most comedians have to use bad language and dirty content. Families need to sit down together and share some good, clean humor. Someday we'd like to see him perform in person. I'm sure we will double over due to laughing so much!"
5,Loved it,"If you love Jim Gaffigan's witty charm and hilarious ""voice of the audience"", you'll love this DVD. One of his best performances yet."
4,solid gaffigan,"What can I say - I love his work, and this one pleases. Not his best, but well worth the rental price."
4,"Love it, but wondering why it is on DVD?",Quite plainly stated on his site that Mr. Universe was NOT going to be released on DVD and the only way to get it was to download off that site. So what the hell?
4,"Another funny, relatable performance.","Very funny. I still probably prefer the Beyond the Pale performance, but this is a little better than his King Baby release."
4,Clean fun,"Enjoyed this DVD but still luv King Baby best of all. We like that the language is pretty clean. Jim Gaffigan just has a way of making you laugh at normal every day occurrences,"
2,some funny stuff,"Watched Beyond the Pale and King Baby along with this one all in one night. He repeats the jokes somewhat so I am just giving my critique on this one. I only saw these as I heard him on XM Sirius . . . an excerpt about ""cake"". Funny. Overall these were good . . . funny . . . time spent well . . . I just down rated it because of the cursing and Christian jokes that were in there. If only he had left those out it would have been a 5 star. Too bad these comics feel they have to interject something racy or controversial to make it. I think they would be surprised how successful they would be if they just kept it clean."
5,Good brakes,I brought this brakes for my 2004 Honda odyssey. The are good quality and well price. I am very satisfied with Wagner's performance.
3,Just not for me,"No offense but this Cloe is not that pretty as she usually is.For instance,I just recently got the sweet dreamz Cloe.She is so beautiful.But this doll is well,her face is just plain WIERD!!If you look closer at the picture or see her at Toy`s R Us then you will see what I mean.If I bought her it would only be for her adorable little outfits.She has a blue and yellow t-shirt has purple butterflies and a pink skirt and has yellow flip flops."
1,Worst Cloe this year,"EWWW!!!She is veeery ugly.Well now I have 2 new Bratz.1.Bratz Dynamite Cloe2.Bratz Play Sportz Gymnastics Yasmin.Get Dynamite Cloe instead.She is moore beautiful than this one.SARA SIBLINI!!!BIG BRATZ FAN!!!P.S.LGP3LNC,I AM NOT YOUR FRIEND ANYMORE.EVEN HANNAH."
4,Natchez,"This book does a nice job of capturing Natchez. The photographs are crisp and all the most important homes are covered. The text is informative and thorough. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Natchez, the Old South, or just southern history in general."
1,"BEWARE!!! Pure sales hype, nothing useful at all","I bought two copies of this book, as both I and my daughter have the Epson 2200 printer. We both expected to find substantial useful information in it about printing!! Instead, it is ==ENTIRELY== a sales pitch, simply telling you what the printers CAN do. The only 'instruction' content is about how to use your photo-editing software. Sure it tells you about the menu you'll find. But, not a word of useful info for any problematical issues we can encounter when using their printers. If you want to know what your printer can do, you can simply research it or read the manual - there's no reason to pay two cents for this book. For photo editing software help, there are dozens of great books out there which contain far more useful information than this primer for utter beginners. I am astounded that they dare to call this a complete guide to digital printing. It isn't a guide to anything. I am extremely dissatisfied."
3,It's okay for a beginner,"There are better versions one of which I have, but can't think of the title.Ta"
2,Not a clear teaching guide,"This book does not provide a clear step by step teaching guide. Too much talk in between code analysis that loses the prior discussion, not a goo tie-it-together approach. Cannot even obtain the examples by FTP which without, you cannot do ANY of this type of programming."
5,Actually entertaining with real stories,"If you are looking for Hentai or Manga this is not it. The episodes are tightly written stories featuring the richest girl in the world, who is also a super cool agent(?!) or corporate boss or leader of the free world shadow government ... it doesn't matter.Its breezy, but still tells some really great stories with some pretty great animation."
5,Sculpting breakthrough!,"In this newest sculpting book Maureen Carlson throughly explains and shows each step of the way how to create a realistic face. The ""whys"" of realism verses character are explored and shown. And the keys to seeing the differences in real people's faces are explored and explained. There are great sculpting instructions for hands, feet, shoes, bodies, costuming and so much more!"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"This book was excellent! The instructions were written in such a manner - that it is simple enough for a beginner, and yet challenging enough for a seasoned sculptor. Every page is filled with excellent examples, techniques and exciting ideas.A 'must have' for anyone really interested in learning to sculpt fun 'little people'!"
5,Clever use of clay and cloth to caricature somewhat inexpensively,Very nice done book. Clever use of clay and cloth to caricature somewhat inexpensively. You can create unique and inexpensive gifts this way.
1,terrible,"TerribleI gave them the exact modle, make, etc of my car and they sent me these floor mats that did not fit. The good part was that amazon took them back without a hassle"
1,Overpriced and misleadingly marketed,"As already covered here, almost any 6-8 foot HDMI cable will provide full bandwidth without a problem. If you're running a 30 foot length of HDMI then google ""HDMI Certified"" and go from there. Needless to say, you won't be spending your money on Monster cables since they don't provide certificates of compliance from independent testing agencies to demonstrate that their cables maintain bandwidth over a specified length."
1,Capitalism at its worst,"Will minimal research you will see Monster's whole strategy is bogus marketing and ridiculously high profit margins. I read a study where they actually tested the signal using measuring equipment. Guess what? The ""cheap"" $2 cables performed exactly the same as the overpriced 100+ dollar ones. Imagine that! Defending parties are trying to deal with the grief of being duped, hence the defense to try to justify their purchase in their own minds."
1,More junk,"There is absolutely no reason to purchase this cable from Monster. As Engadget has pointed out time and time again, Monster uses hype and dirty tricks to get you to buy their cables. I would suggest that you go with the anything other than Monster. At least do your research before you drop $200 on a cable. In most cases the extra $200 could be used to get yourself better equipment.These guys are so bad, they sued a miniature golf outlet named ""Monster Golf"" for trademark infringement. It is true, look it up.HDMI Cable-2 Meter (6.6 ft) HDMI KING Gold Plated v1.3 HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ferrite Cores"
1,my 2 cents,"monster cables are no different. if you are noticing a difference between these cables and monoprice cables, you should stop drinking so much. the only place you'll see a difference is if the cable is damaged- then you might see pixelation or jagging. order 2 $10 cables if you need to be sure one will work and you'll still save 90%..."
1,200 what!!!,"It does the same thing as the cheap brand that does the same thing. U are basically buying a brand name and their extravagant advertising. Does it come with real gold or real piece diamond then i'm sure a few buyers would like them. Or if you feel paying more makes u feel it does wonders, just get the ones that cost 30 to 40 dollars from any brand. I'm sure that will make buyers feel monstrous. And if you want bestbuy to stay alive (prevent from bankrupcy) like i do so we can do physical inspection at the store before i buy online, than go all out buy this 200 monster cable."
1,Don't get ripped off,"I normally don't write reviews, but I'm doing this one mainly because I want to lower the 3.5 star (average) that it currently has, so then maybe one chap won't get ripped off. It does the same thing as cheap cables, at 60x the price. The ugly copper/white/black color design is not worth the $197 premium that you're paying. Actually, I'd rather get regular black colored HDMI cable, even if both were priced the same."
5,Great Cable,New 3D Mitsubishi T.V.: Sound would come on first but no picture for 20-30 seconds...Installed Monster M1000HD ==Now picture comes on same time as sound! I AM A Believer! For New 3D T.V.'s This is the Wire. I am happy! Oh! P.S. Great Picture!!!
1,Is this a joke product offering?,"This is a $3.00 product being sold for over $100!! This listing has to be like the $5,000 Twinkies on eBay. Heck, Amazon sells their own HMDI cables for $6 - $10, why would anyone but this? It is physically (as in the laws of physics) impossible for this cable to provide a better picture than Amazon.com's own HMDI cable. It's science and fact."
1,Save your money,"I challenge anyone who thinks Monster brand cables are superior to those offered by Monoprice or any other reputable cable maker to explain to me how a digital signal (by definition lossless) can be BETTER over one cable than another.Do a google search for ""Do Coat Hangers Sound As Good Monster Cables?""You'll be amazed to learn that Monster cables are simply the biggest rip off since the inception of HD programing. Yucks and Huxters at bigbox stores push them for one reason only: the massive 95% markup. They WILL NOT give you a better picture, better sound, or better anything at all. What they will do is lighten your wallet.Unless you enjoy starting fires with $20 bills, skip the marketing hype and buy yourself a reasonably priced cable. As long as it is HDMI 1.3 and has 10GB throughput you will be fine."
1,Mr Rey,I purchase two thinking is a good deal and savings for my pocket. I install tow my flat TV and connection was not good and are loose. Iam very dissapointed. Even my television installer have said return all of them and buy some chief in Wal-mart. That a smart buy.
3,Monster M1000 is over price,"I am agreeing that, this M1000 is way over price. How ever it is providing high quality TV image. I tested the M1000 HDMI with one of the stock HDMI cable on my Sony blu-ray and Samsung 120Hz TV. You can see right away the difference. M1000 is more bright and clear images the other is dull and darker image and could not hear the difference between the audio.But I will not pay $100 for this cable. You can find this cable for $30 to $50.I got my for $35 at Shazam store (Amazon).I gave 3 stars because the price."
4,Love it,Any product for monster cable is good quality and for the price can beat any other stores costumer satisfied :?
5,Item Never Received,"Do not use this seller. The item was never received.No communication from seller about why not, what problem there is, etc.My only bad experience on Amazon ever."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used to work for Best Buy, and our discount at the time was to get the items for cost. We could buy these cables for less than $7 each.... bit of a markup from the companies, huh? I also found that these cables do the exact same thing as the lower end cables, just with a brand name.Don't waste your money. During these hard economic times we all still enjoy getting some items that make us feel better, why not be able to get more of what we enjoy with less money spent."
1,monster price,"Monster cables are a waste of money. If you like throwing money away, buy them. Better yet, buy reasonably priced cables and give the difference to your favorite charity. You'll feel better about yourself and make others feel better too. If you buy monster cables, you'll not feel too good when you see your friends HD TVs that don't have them. I guess whoever sells them to you will feel pretty happy."
1,Are you kidding?,"I have a new very high-end 58"" Samsung HDTV connected to an expensive Denon blu-ray player. So you can see a lot of detail and color with this set-up. After disconnecting my free HDMI cable with this Monster HDMI cable, there was absolutely NO difference in sound and quality. The cheap HDMI cables to the job just fine, and there is absolutely no justification for the price of these Monster HDMI cables. Monster does a great job of advertising, but maybe someday people will catch on."
1,Severely Overpriced,"You can buy an excellent cable through Monoprice for a fraction of the price and will have HDMI 1.4 and have the same GB as this overpriced Monster HDMI cable. Previously, I had purchased Monster cables but since learned about Monoprice and have to say when comparing the two side by side I would say the Monoprice cable is better quality and feels more sturdy. But of course with HDMI their isn't a difference in quality. When doing long runs with Cat5 or Cat6 and converting it to HDMI then you may need 24 gauge HDMI cable but the Monster brand won't provide any difference in quality. I even purchased a 25' Monoprice in-wall HDMI cable for about quarter of the price of the thinner 4' Monster cable."
1,Don't be a sucker,"If you pay more than $10-15 for an HDMI cable, YOU GOT HOODWINKED!Digital signals either work perfectly or not at all. There is no degradation like with old analog systems. Don't waste your money, don't be a sucker."
1,Garbage,"Construction of these cables - absolute garbage. Bought 2 - tips bent immediately when trying to make an adjustment. Maybe one cable, OK it's a lemon ... but two?!I have 4ft Monster MC 1000HD Ultra-High Speed HDTV HDMI cables, never had an issue with them. Only bought new ""upgraded"" cables because I needed more length, figured I would get the newest model. What a mistake.Just bought two Monster 4M 1000HD cables, I do not expect any problems."
1,What a total waste of money...,HDMI is a digital signal meaning it either works or it doesn't. There's no in between. That $3.99 HDMI cable you can find anywhere will give you just as good of quality as this overpriced piece of garbage. I can't believe people fall for this stuff...
2,waste of money,This was a waste of money. The gold colored ends broke off as soon as I connected to my TV.
3,Must have for PS3 ONLY,"I am no techie but I did notice that this cable makes the PS3 gaming graphics and sound MUCH better. There was no difference between this chord and the Philips chord I use on my Samsung LCD 52in. I did not give it five stars because I find it hard to believe that Monster does not know full well it is very overpriced. Perhaps the general public is not Monster's main target group but rather professional installers, home builders, etc. ONLY GET THIS CABLE IF YOU ARE GETTING A PS3 AND will be using full 1080i native. For that purpose ONLY is it worth the money."
3,On the Fence,"I bought this when I finally bought a 55 inch flat screen LED, but when I hooked it up the picture quality did not improve. I'm sure this is a great product, but it did not work for me."
5,Great Cable,"This was not exactly what I was expecting, but was a pleasant surprise. The picture quality is noticably better than my cheaper HDMI cable. The covering is a mesh material instead of plastic and will not twist or bind in any way, very high quality in my opinion."
5,Amazing!!!,Awesome picture and awesome sound that come out of this cord. I use it on my PS3 and when watching the games on the big screen.
5,VIDEOPHILE CABLE EXTRODINAIRE,"I know what your saying. Why pay so much for a cable! Why? because untill you hook this HDMI to your system, you are not really seeing how good your HD can be..Plus the benefit of the new DOLBY DTS HD-Master that this cable can send to your receiver. Pick one up..You will thank yourself for the investment. MONSTER RULES!"
3,"Scary at first, but satisfied in the end","The first time I attempted to use this program, I was frightened. It was very confusing with so many windows and buttons (I was quite a novice at the time). After importing a site to it the I had written with ascii and using the help program that came along with it, it made sense to me. I really enjoy it now, and in only a few weeks I feel I have quite a firm grasp on web design. My only other complaint is its crashing problem. It crashes when I try to save sites and corrupts my site files (both the main and backup files) when I try to use the inspector.My advice to you is ""NOT FOR BEGINNER USE"" and ""SAVE OFTEN."""
5,by Eric Lewis ...,"Chromosomos is a Polish ensemble with varied influences, from Balkan and Near Eastern folk music, klezmer, eastern European new music, post-rock, and the funk Jazz fusion of M-Base. Throw in a dash of electric Ornette Coleman, and you start to get the idea. Quite heavy on the virtuoso guitar solo, this project avoids slipping into the quagmire of Jazz-rock fusion by virtue of its intelligent compositions and folk influences. If you enjoy the more rock tinged recordings of Knitting Factory Records you should give this a listen. It is also very well recorded."
4,Disgaea 2 yeas and nays,The item world is a lot easier to get through than what it was on the first Disgaea. It's also easier to get bills passed in the dark assembly. I don't like having to wait to create new charectors. But the story line and the new charectors are just as good as the old. And I love the opening music video!
4,not to series startigy game,"Disgaea 2: Cursed MemoriesThe disgaea series is a strategy series that doesn't take it self so series, making jokes as well as fun item information. The game play can be difficult at times, and you will need to grind and invest a lot of time to get everything you need in the game but if your a fan of strategy games or rpgs this is a buy that you will enjoy."
5,"Overall, an Incredibly Well-Made Video Game.","For me, being a ""casual gamer"", I found Disgaea very entertaining, especially because you can customize almost every aspect of game play, even from equipment, weapons, status, jobs, and even up to collecting felonies from subpoenas via the item world. Note, I don't actually own the game, but borrowed it from a friend, but I still got to see a good portion of the game. Disgaea 2 can be beaten fairly quickly, containing only 13 chapters, but if you want to really tweak your team of mercenaries, you can spend over 100 hours EASILY before you beat the main storyline of the game. Not to mention, the second cycle. But beating the main storyline isn't even half of the game... There's TONS of extra levels, special characters, item collecting, and leveling to do.I would definitely recommend Disgaea 2 to any strategy game fan, especially if you're a fan of Nippon-Ichi games; Buy it! You won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome,"I bought Disgaea when it first came out and thought it was great. Fun, funny, and with many long hours of game play. When 2 came out, I was excited. It didnt let me down.Many features were improved from the first game. The assembly is much more wieldy now. The item world is more controlled. And the battle are more challenging. They also removed the ridiculous overpowered character aka angels and majiin that took forever to unlock and only obssesed players get em."
4,Entertainment,"First of all, the game was in good condition when I got it. Second, the game was a laugh. I mean a big laugh. My sides hadn't hurt that much in quite a while. The battle sequeneces weren't always exciting, but they were usually fun nonetheless. I had no problems with the sound, the graphics, anything like that."
3,oily,"Product is really oily. The smell is not very lavendar, im not sure what to call the smell other than a bit unpleasant."
4,James Bay Archeology,"This book was published as the Royal Ontario Museum's Archeology Monograph 10 in 1986--the year of the author's death--and is an overview of the author's archeological research at Fort Albany and Charlton Island in the 1960s and 70s. Included are numerous illustartions and photographs of the many items that were unearthed. A very useful volume for those interested in the fur trade, European colonization of Canada, or the history of Canada's North."
1,Not a real Expendable,"this is a movie that some one slap the title on it Expendables. It an old movie some one got the idea to tie it to the Expendables, it even shows the original title."
5,Great wipes,"These are great wipes. I use them in an industrial setting. They work great with all types of chemicals...alcohol, cleaners, silicone, etc."
3,Don;t get them wet,"As previously stated, these are great heavy duty gloves, but the red bleeds to the fingers. Women don't like that"
4,Gardening gloves,"For the price these gardening gloves are quite substantial. My gloves get a good workout throughout the gardening season, so I will look forward to see how they hold up. I gave these gloves as gifts this year to friends."
4,Great gloves,"I got these as a gift for my 70 year old Mom who tends her garden. She loves them, and wants another pair in case something happens to these."
3,Good gloves,"Got a good price from amazon. The biggest drawback i see is , the overall length of the gloves was a little bit short. Not the fingers part , but after the Palm area - the gloves are short. This causes junk getting into the glove while working with these gloves on"
1,thick seams between fingers cause blisters,"These look sturdy, but I'll never have the chance to find out, as the seams between the fingers are so bulky they are quite uncomfortable. Using these for only a short time gave me blisters."
2,Ladies XL gloves (US Sizing),"These gloves are HUGE for average-sized people. I wear a M in a Ladies glove and the pair I received were G/L in EU sizing, which is an XL Ladies Glove in US sizing. I suppose that's OK for $2.50, but it would be nice if the sizing is shown here. The glove is too big on me to be useful."
2,not potent,"perhapse I have a different idea about erotic. Ryan is right, there are many beautiful ladies in this movie, and they do show it all. But nothing else ever happens. How can a woman dream of having another woman in the bed without doing anything with her? The man in movie, I would say if it were me, would have been extremly frustrated. He didn't get to do anything. The ladies, though, are very nice looking.I would rate this movie X-."
4,Wish they made this in gallon size,"This is the only product that I have found that can tame my frizzy curly hair. I usually straighten my hair, but this product makes it possible to wears my curls once in a while. I have to use a lot of it though and Redken does not make this product in bigger bottles."
5,Put POWER into your hypnosis!,"A comprehensive resource of physical / visual hypnotic demonstrations and convincers for those wishing to master Stage, Street or Clinical Hypnosis!This two-DVD educational set teaches the skills necessary for you to present powerful demonstrations of hypnotic phenomena with both clients and casual observers. Includes clips of Richard K. Nongard performing these skills live with real people, with detailed explanations.If you are a stage or street or clinical hypnotist, looking for impressive ways to physically / visually astonish your guests, this DVD is for you.If you are a clinical hypnotist seeking strategies to give your clients what they really want, overcome resistance and and improve efficacy, this DVD is for you.Elements of pre-talk, convincers and use of hypnotic phenomena such as catlepsy, levitation, and hypnotic amnesia are demonstrated and explained."
5,A beautiful book.,"Probably my favorite motherhood book, Guarding the Moon is achingly tender, gorgeously written, and shimmery with Block's unique sensibility. I bought two copies, just in case one wears out!"
2,Too Moon-eyed for Me,"I read this book on the basis of the rave reviews here. Frankly, I was disappointed. I found it tediously self-indulgent and self-absorbed. She goes on and on and ON about how enraptured she is with her bambina, and yet every now again she lets slip something like how ""they lost their regular sitter"" when the baby was nine months old. A sitter! Yet she has said over and over how incredibly attached and preoccupied whe is with this infant! In that way she reminds me of the aunt in Proust's Swann's Way who claimed she never ever slept and yet would sometimes forget and say something about waking up or nodding off, or of a dream she had had.Block is so totally focused on her feelings and her body that in some ways the baby is almost incidental to the story."
1,good book--for some good laughs,"This is the most self-indulgent piece of you-know-what I've ever read in my life. I got this book for a present, and I ended up turning to random pages and reading out loud random passages to friends so that we could laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. I'm a first-time mother, and I'm appalled that anyone would think that I could relate to this woman's awful narrative. It's like she just decided to publish her personal journal, thinking that people would enjoy reading it. And I guess some have, but it just wasn't for me!"
1,Does not work even after4 coats,"By buying this more expensive sealer, I thought I would have nothing to worry about. But even after 4 coats, I don't get the desired result on my kitchen granite. My granite type is: typhoon green. I called up stone tech experts after applying 2 coats and they asked me to apply a few more coats. Now after 4 coats, I still have water marks in 5 minutes. We aren't taking any chances with cookIng oil making sure we have no spills at all. I might call the granite guys to seal it. But after more than a gallon of stone tech use, we are left disappointed"
4,Book Three,"(This book is also known as ""Princess in Love"".)Princess Amelia Thermopolis Renaldo has boy problems. A LOT of boy problems.Her best friend Lilly, who happens to be a certified genius and a dedicated liberal, is dating the uber-geeky Boris Pelkowski, notorious sweater-tucker-inner.The object of her affections, Michael Moscovitz, seems to be totally in love with a much more intelligent girl who has the ability to clone flies.And, then there's Kenny. Mia's adoring boyfriend. Unfortunately, the feeling isn't mutual. Will Mia find the courage to set Kenny down gently before she leaves for Genovia for Christmas?"
5,Such a good book an value,"This book is just perfect for the butterfly uses..with flowers in scapbooking,decoupage,lots of good quality pictures.B.W."
2,"Very Cute, but not ideal","I had read some reviews and expected my toddler to rest easily in this seat. There were two main problems I have with it. 1st- when my toddler nods off, I can tell she is uncomfortable as her head is flopped forward. 2nd- I have to constantly readjust the seat belt, every time I put her in, because the seat belt slots do not have any type of hold on the seat belt itself. My parents bought a different style model, the Graco Cargo booster seat. This one even though it isn't pink or purple, provides much more comfort for my little one."
4,grand daughter,"I needed something to haul my grand daughter around with without switching the babyseat each time my daughter drops her off. I like babyseats better, but this is the next step up as she's a toddler and it works good."
5,Great Booster!,I bought this product because the Graco TurboBoosters are well-reviewed by Consumer Reports. The head support on this one has worked very well to support my daughter's head when she falls asleep in the car. The fabric is also very cute. My 6-year old loves it.
4,not for sleep booster,This seat is perfect for everything but sleeping. My Daughter loved the colors the cups and is very comfortable. Except when she falls asleep. When she falls asleep she ends up sideways and slumped over onto the armrest. If I had known this I would have kept her toddler car seat a little longer.
3,Pretty good.,Good Light. The lght drains fast if left on the white light the whole time. The HP version is the one I needed. Good for simple tasks.
4,just got it on so will tell later how it worked. Have heard positive things from a DNR employee.,just got it so will tell later how it worked. Have heard positive recommendations from a DNR employee.Will see how the deer are kept from seedling pine trees
1,Deer Away Big Game Repellant,The deer are still nibbling at my trees. The product was very difficult to mix and I would like to have known what would make it easier. I would like to have had a description of how much product to spray on at a time. Just a little wet or dripping. Probably won't try this product or any other like it.
3,The CZ out-sparkles the setting...,I received the ring much faster than I anticipated- in that regards- communication and packaging by the seller is outstanding! I was not as happy with the ring as I thought I would be... The CZ is sparkly and beautiful... the setting has a very dull finish. I uploaded some photos so you can judge for yourself.EDIT ON 9/21/08I used a regular polishing cloth to try and make the setting shine but it didn't work. Then I used a dremel with a homemade polishing disc and polished the setting and that worked quite nicely. Now the details in the ring setting stand out a little more. I just wish I could figure out a way to make the filigree holes bigger... they're like pinpricks...
3,"Good work, but...","What I've listened to so far has been top-notch Afrocelt music. HOWEVER...with the first copy of the CD I received from Amazon, the first song skipped about 6 minutes in. So I returned it and got a replacement. With the second copy, the second song skips and the third song won't play at all. I'm returning it for a refund, so I can take my chances on the CD elsewhere. My wife and I have ordered numerous books and CDs from Amazon, but this whole fiasco has been a big disappointment."
5,"Run, don't walk to Get this album","This is my second Afro Celt album (I've had ""Vol. 3 Further in Time"" for some time). This group is just stupendous. Mohave is my favorite but there are absolutely no weak tracks on this CD. If you are a fan of world music, like contemporay celtic music and/or go for tunes with great rhythm hooks, then you can not go wrong in purchasing this album. Between this as a fav on Slacker radio and my own personal copy now, I never seem to get tired of it."
4,All you'll ever need to learn French,"This book cleary shows French grammer with a great method of learning that appeals to all students of this language. While taking my French 3 course, I was stuck having to reveiw every single grammer rule in the school textbook every night for the upcoming tests. But this book showed the rules limpidly and easily introduced any begginer to intermeidiate level of French student how to learn any french grammer rule extremely easily."
4,eye witness news,"EDWARD R. MURROW 4/15/1908 to 4/2/1965. Died from Cancerdue to smoking.THIS I BELIEVE-----SEE IT NOW-----PERSON TO PERSON.CBS radio and TV news. Left CBS because of clashes withChairman Bill Paley.

2,"A weak remake of ""The Fugitive"" - but Ashley Judd is no Harrison Ford","So, ""The Fugitive"" was such a hit they decided to remake it, complete with a nearly identical plot AND Tommy Lee Jones as the pursuing lawman. Then they substituted Ashley Judd for Harrison Ford. Unfortunately she's playing above her pay grade in this movie which is basically a clunker, redeemed only by the brilliant Tommy Lee Jones who simply can't be bad, no matter the material.There are so many implausible plot twists, not least of which is the idea that if you get wrongfully convicted of killing someone who is not actually dead, you can go ahead and kill them and not be prosecuted for it twice (""double jeopardy"") which is completely untrue."
4,Cruel but fascinating and funny,"The book is filled with descriptions, excerpts, quotes etc from the rich history of ""lawfull"" homicide. Every method of execution or torture, are minutely explained. Do not mistake, this is not a reference book. All the above comes within a story about an aficionado hang-man opening a school for executioners. There is much more to tell, of course, mainly about the feminine student that gives the book its title, but I will let you read for yourself. If you ever read another Kohout, you will like this one, if not, it's as good as any to begin with. Enjoy."
5,A Wonderful Package all around,"Cilla has an amazing voice and I am finally glad to see some of her lesser know tracks available on CD. It is also nice to see a compilation put together not in chronological order, but rather an order that is pleasing to the ear. All and all this is a wonderful set and a must have."
1,Not recommendable,"Appearance is disappointing. The received book is merely a photocopy in black/white. This does not match up to the description(coloured cover, dimensions) given in amazon web site."
2,"Good information, Bad presentation","There is some good, useful information in this book. But personally I found it hard to get past the country boy, hick lingo that he uses so much. For example, ""Never Try to Milk a Steer"". There are so many metaphors like this, I couldn't get through the whole book because I was laughing instead of absorbing the information. Most of the information is good, but if the book was more well written it would be alot better. I stopped reading this book and moved on to another one that I purchased at the same time, Millionaire Real Estate Mentor, I think its written by Russ Whitney or Ross Whitney, something like that. That one is awesome so far and I would recommend it above this book any day."
5,Nice and original tie,"This tie has a very nice quality and feels nice to the touch. Even though the original ""scream"" has different colors, it looks better considering that this item will be worn. If you are looking for an original tie that will catch other's attention, you can never go wrong with this one."
4,JD Bought as a gift.,I purchased this toy as a gift for a friend who collects this stuff. My friend was very happy to receive this gift and td me that it was a good quality collectible.
3,Decent contemporary country for someone who doesn't care for contemporary country,"Trust me, I am not a big fan of today's country music. If I do listen to country, I prefer classic country such as Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson (and I am young man). But I am a big Joe Nichols fan, mainly because I caught him on Austin City Limits. He has a wonderful voice, and there are some great songs on here. Life Don't Have to Mean Nothing At All gets me every time. I know it's a bit of a country rap, but the refrain has great harmony, and there's a nice guitar break."
2,Better luck next time,"The man has an undeniably great voice, but needs to take some control over the material. There is an occassional nice melody or catchy lyric, unfortunately they never meet up. Even the few songs that are catchy at first quickly wear on you, and I can no longer listen to this disc at all. How this got nominated for a Grammy is beyond my reasoning."
1,get an original sound,"Joe Nichols has a great voice. But we already have a Merle Haggard. What ever happened to wearing boots and jeans and simply keeping country. He also sounds electronic, so that means they were fixing his voice up in the studio. I would like to hear something raw and natural."
5,FINALLY,"Joe Nichols has a wonderful talet and especially for being so young. If you like the song ""The Impossible"" then you will enjoy the rest of the CD. This CD is worth every penny. All I can is that I'm glad he finally came out with a CD."
5,Great!,"Gosh, this is just an awesome CD...songs like 'The Impossible', 'Brokenheartsville', and 'Cool To Be A Fool' are sure to be hits...great job!"
4,A very good start,"This is a very good cd to start out with. Best songs are theimpossible ,life don't have to mean nothin at all, she only smokes when she drinks, brokenheartsville, everythings athing,and you ain't heard nothing yet. if this is a hint of what's to come he's got a long career ahaed of him."
3,Too Much Jargon,"Thomas Moran usually blows my socks off with his amazing stories of overcoming the skeletons in people's closets. However, Anja the Liar, although a good read, can easily put you to sleep with its excessive detail to military jargon and extensive use of Polish, German, Russian, Chech, and French. Half the time, I skipped pages due to mounting paragraphs of foreign languages. A big disappointment...but I'll keep reading Moran's stuff, b/c he's just that good!"
4,Cannon UNI-Troll 5 Downrigger,"This downrigger is very simple and functional. While I haven't used this one yet, I have used an identical one that belongs to a friend and it works well. Assembly is a bit challenging, threading the wire cable through the small plastic holder with several loops and very small plastic holes. The instructions for this part of the assembly (and other parts) are poorly written."
5,Uni-Troll5 &low profile swivel base,"I love these products, now I own four of these. I recommend these product to anyonewho is in market for cannon downrigers. Amazon is very good company, and I have dealtwith them before. They are very fast in processing your orders,and quick delivery."
1,Either very poorly published or I received a photocopy,"The book is so poorly published (typed in shades of grey and tables barely legible) that it is impossible to read. I was eager to read some groundbreaking content, I work in Shanghai China and have several MWBs to handle. However the message of the author cannot get through because of utterly poor publishing. I now understand why the publisher wouldn't have the readers search inside the book on amazon..."
3,I expected more...,"This is another good reading of how to change a company. Was good to read the Unilever case, however the book itself seemed to me a bit too sientific. The book may be optmized down to 1/3 of it's size."
2,Disappointing!,"I was very excited when I saw this DVD in the store, and I bought it. I really wanted to see Oumou Sangare and Tinariwen perform live, but in both cases, just as the song starts, THEY CUT AWAY FOR AN INTERVIEW! Somehow they manage to include complete performances from the people I didn't care about (Robert Plant, the awful French group, the Navajo heavy-metal band...) while short-changing the actual local bands. The Navajo band is intriguingly weird: the lead singer gives a heart-felt speech about his people losing their culture and language, then the band launches into a heavy-metal song sung in ENGLISH. That was kinda (sadly) amusing..."
1,Cheap Hose,I bought this hose in Oct. 2011 to replace orginal on 94 S10 pickup. The fit right but now 8 months later this hose blew out and left me on the side of road. The hose looks like it has been on the truck for 10 yrs not 8 months!!!! Cheap hose that will blow in a few months... Do not buy or you will be sorry. I learned you get what you pay for.. buy name brand.
4,Beautiful feminine watch,"I love this watch. This is the third one for me. It has both silver and gold accents so it goes with everything. It is slim and attractive. The only bad thing is the latch will come open by itself. Thus, I lost the first 2. This time I took it to a watch repair and had the clasp tightened. No problems with it just falling off anymore. I highly recommend this product."
3,Just started the study this week,"We just began the study in this book in our Sunday School class and so far, I like it.Primarily, I like it because the author expects us to read 4-5 chapters a week and be ready for class, rather than spoon-feeding half of a chapter or 20 verses or so with a short lesson each time (i.e., giving us a lesson that we do not actually need to prepare for and think about all week long, but only need to be present for an hour on Sunday to receive).Basically, I see this as the author's way of saying, ""The text of the Bible is more important than my commentary. Read MORE of it."" It feels less like a child's study and more like we are a bunch of adults who should be able to take some responsibility for our studies outside of Sunday morning's class.I'll probably edit this review once we have finished the book."
2,Was Iron Maiden right?,"I picked this up wondering what the number of the beast of the apocalypse was. I was suprised to learn that indeed, as Iron Maiden said so many years ago, 666 is the number of the beast. Who'da thunk?"
2,movie is way better,"dont waste time on reading this poorly written book because the movie is just so much worth your while. its hard to believe since typically movies do not do the book justice. well, in this case, thank the director and the cast because they made one of the worst books come alive."
3,it's just a list of questions,"I'm not sure if it was my expectations about this book or the execution, but ""What a Question"" was rather underwhelming. I found it in a library using a search for books on conversation and how to have better conversations. The book is nothing more than a list of questions that can be asked in conversation. That's it. There are about 300 questions, and the book is broken up into sections where questions about related topics will all be grouped together. The problem was that many of the questions were not very interesting and I can hardly imagine asking them. There were a few questions that I felt I might want to ask, and I wrote those down, but as a whole the book was a waste of my time. It seemed like the questions were for if you were at a dinner party with a group of people you don't know and needed a random question to move the conversation. If you want a book that is a list of questions, this one may be for you, but I fear that I can't recommend this book."
2,"Fast read, but out-dated.","The best thing about this book is that it shouldn't take anyone w/a basic understanding of Hold 'Em more then 1 hour to read this tome in it's entirety (72 pages, incl. glossary, large type and lots of 'clip-art' quality illustrations). On the downside, the information and strategy presented in this book are simplistic and somewhat out of date when the original 1987 publication date is taken into consideration. I would recommend this book more for the seasoned player who may enjoy this breezy little read for it's nostalgia value, but for those still learning the game there are much better, more contemporary alternatives out there."
2,"If you consider yourself an intermediate player, go buy theb","With a few months of internet experience, and a bankroll steadily growing, I considered myself an intermediate player. But I wanted to get a more steadfast grip on concepts such as position and implied odds. I did not find much of value in this book, and especially the casual style of the author annoyed me immensely. If you want poker jokes and elementary card playing skills you might enjoy this book. If you're serious about poker go find something more structured. This book teach you only the basics and is not even good at that."
4,An Important Poker Resource,"Andy Nelson writes clear, brief treatises on poker. This book is intended for the player who already knows the basics of Texas Hold 'Em, but still has trouble winning consistently.What you get is important generalized advice about playing Texas Hold'Em. What you don't get is hand-by-hand analyses, lists of starting hands by position, or tables of probabilities. Get another book for those.Get this book to make the right choices in non-quantifiable situations and to know why those choices are right. Get this book to win more (or lose less)."
2,Not what I expected...,"A big SLAVE fan since the 70's I was disappointed by this concert. First of all, 'Drac' Hicks is the only remaining 'original' member remaining but he still could have pulled it off because he 's so talented. But, SLAVE's sound also had some nasty bass to make you groove and whoever is handling it is not up to par with Mark Adams and (or)very under-mixed... Vintage concerts from the golden era of those bands DO exist (got a Don Kirshner's show by SLAVE and what a difference). Why not putting them out? Or at least try to match the sound that made them famous in the first place."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was thoroughly pleased with the audio being taped at an outdoor concert. This is a really good band, although only one original Slave member. The lead vocalist does an outstanding cover of Steve Arrington !"
2,Remains fails as narrative,"Having read many histories of the AVG, I found myself trying to match up the main characters with historical figures. I gave up after about three chapters. The graphic sex descriptions added nothing to the value of the book IMO and in some cases detracted. All in all I got what I paid for but that same kind of information can be found in ""Lady and the Tigers"" without the unseemly parts."
5,Chrome,The CD was great. Of course with anything that is associated with Trace Adkins it would be. I can't wait till his next CD comes out. I have everyone so far.
5,Greatest Voice,This man has the sexiest voice in the world. This CD is great and worth buying just so you can listen to his voice. Hopefully he'll keep coming out with many more great CDs.
5,THIS CD ROCKS HARD!!,"I found this cd in my college radio station. And I lovethe raw honesty of it. The vocals, guitars - it's soin your face. The bass and drums are just penatrating.I can't wait to hear what this band does next. It's melodicbut defiant. It's youthful but mature songwriting.Very unpredictable. Sounds better than anything else I hearon the radio."
4,Filling the Gap (Personally),"I could have listened to Tom Petty when he really started to glow; it was the corny graphic symbol and the naming itself of the Heartbreakers that put me off.Almost 30 years later, I gave my son 'Runnin' Down a Dream' DVD not knowing anything much; I just thought it would help his guitar playing.The impact of viewing the DVD was so stunning. The book of the same title is also very informative, as well as the book : Conversations with Tom Petty.I also watched the music video anthology 'Play Back.' Whenever I watch the one when Tom Petty plays 'Change of Heart,' I feel the awe first time all over again. I wanted to be able to listen to 'Change of Heart' on CD. That is why I purchased the CD : Long After Dark."
5,overstock.com had a lens for the same price,Overstock.com sold this camera with a lens for the same price.
3,Not bad but...,"I found the book good, but I didn't walk away feeling that it provided a good grasp of any but the most general concepts of OO. I would have preferred to see more examples of turning a problem into an OO solution rather than ""here's how to write a class in Java, C++, etc...""."
5,Great book for introductory of OOP,"I like the examples that book gave! It's very descriptive.The book covers from basic to detail, so you will understand the idea of OOP better."
4,exploring new musical alternatives,"If you are looking for classic vallenato, this may not fulfill your expectations. Though maintaining the accordion as a central actor, Vives incorporates other instruments (guitars and gaita) which gives the songs more of a ""fussion"" feeling. Good lyrics, but sadly he felt to the tempation of including some English words, as well as the commonplace ""Latino"", in a clear wink to English-speaking audiences. It is good dancing music (something not very desirable for classic vallenato but which at the same time can be a very good introduction for newcomers to vallenato) but falls short when compared with previous works. A very positive note is that Vives explores other Colombian rithms, something that will sure enrich our musical habits. A must for Vives' fans, a great present for the upcoming christmas season."
5,Carlos vives suena mejor que nunca,"este no es simplemente otro disco del artista tropical mas popular de latinoamerica, es la ultima obra de un rockero innvador de principios de nuevo milenio, que gracias a su experimentación dentro de la variedad cultural y musical de la costa atlantica Colombiana, mezclada con otros ritmos regionales latinoamericanos y porsupuesto con tendencias pop, rock, reegae, y hasta techno ha logrado un sonido elite y muy propio. En sus discos se manifiesta una evolución drastica, un compromiso personal por hacer cada vez mas interesante y conteporaneo su trabajo sin perder su sentido comercial. Enhorabuena para Vives."
1,I wasted my money on this one.,Carlos got stuck in a loop with this one.I'd have better things to say if he took better advantage of many talented composers that could write much better songs than the ones he's bringing out. There's much better vallenato material than this in Colombia.
5,A virtuoso storyteller. A surreal and palpable experience.,"The most amazing story I've ever read. It tells the tale of our government's complicity in the drug trade, and does so in a staccato, visually expressive fashion. It reads like a Clancy novel, except with less clutter and more humanity. Why isn't this a movie?"
1,Sent it back,A friend recommended this to me. I was disappointed with it. It didn't sharpen my drills accurately enough for me. I work mostly in stainless which is more demanding.
5,"Wow, what a shapener",The drill doctor is everything I expected. A friend of mine also has the 750x which I had used several times. I finally realized I had to have one. The first one delivered had a part missing. I contacted Amazon about the problem printed off the shipping labels as directed and was in the process of sending back the defected shapener. Before I could finalize the shipping Amazon had shipped a replacement. I was wowed. Most places you have to ship back the defected item before the company sends the replacement. After receiving the replacement I put it to use within a couple of days and I wasn't disappointed. Everything worked as expected. The Drill Doctor came in a nice case with an instructional video. Way to go Amazon and Drill Doctor.
3,plastic,seems overpriced for a discontinued item. Amazon would tell you it was discontinued if they were honest brokers.
5,Excellent Drill bit shapener,"I just recently purchased a Drill Doctor. After a little practice it does a excellent job sharpening bits. The video was a great help. I only wish I had the carrying case for my drill doctor, I didn't know a case was available at the time. For the price you can't beat it. I would encourage any one to purchase the machine that does the larger bits. I am very pleased with my Drill Doctor."
1,Wrong Sized Motor + US style plug,"Dear Review Manager,I was delighted to receive my Drill Doctor, but after unpacking noted that it was fitted with a plug to suit a US electrical outlet.No problem I thought, hardly worth requesting an exchange so fitted a 3 pin plug to suit Australian electrical outlet. Now I note that the rating of the motor is only 110 volts so assume unsuitable for Australian arrangements anyway (240 volts)!Surely your ordering department is aware of the differing electrical supplies and connections before dispatching purchases!!??Please advise on proposed remedial action so my faith in Amazon (and that of my friends) can be maintained.Yours sincerely,Peter Gillett"
2,Drill Doctor Drill Bit Sharpener,"I think it is overpriced. For the cost, and in my situation, it is easier to just buy new bits."
3,better with bigger bits,"This product works well with bits 1/4"" and up.Whereas the basic design of this product is good - there is an issue when trying to sharpen smaller bits. The mechanism used to align the bit before sharpening does not work well with small bits.Making good split tips is more difficult and would be improved with a better alignment mechanism.I bought mine from Amazon a month ago for $125.00.The most recent version looks like they may have improved the alignment mechanism.The machine takes a bit (ha- ha) of getting used to; for the most part it works quite well.When drilling metals it is always a good idea to apply oil to the contact surface and drill at slow speed. If you are able to keep your bits cool (that's what the oil does) they last a long time.More common is to snap off a small bit that you would like to then resharpen.As this machine doesn't do small bits well - you still end up having to replace them.caslo"
4,drill dr.,"The DrillDr.750 I got for Christmas was put to work immediatly after lunch, and before I knew it I had sharpened 100 bits.It seems easy to load, but subsequent inspection showed I needed to take more care in alignment. Don't hog (use a lot of pressure) or it will use up the diamond dust quickly. Boy, they really looked sharp, but a few wouldn't drill through 1/8"" steel,so luckly I had several others and found some that would cut. Probably my alignment as opposed to overheating. Saved $0.00 through Amazon.com."
1,Would not purchase this one,Did everything according to instructions and videos could not get metal bis to sharpen good idea just doesn't work as says!
5,Does exactly what it says,"It's really nice to buy a product that is exactly what you expected. The Drill Doctor does what it says. I have a couple hundred drill bits in a drawer and none of them have been sharpened for years. I leave this plugged in on the work bench and when I grab a bit that is dull, I just turn it on and sharpen it. It's easy, handy and it is really nice to work with sharp bits. The instructions are good and it looks like this thing should last for years. I'd definitely buy this product again."
5,DRILL DR. 750X,"After receiveing the unit I found the instructional CD very helpful. The manual was very informative and shows how to do everything step by step. Sharpened about 30 bits from the get go and it worked great. Even tried out a few in wood and was very pleased. Need to learn the specifics on carbide masonry/concrete bits--these are a little tricky but with a little practice I should be fine. The price was great - a very affordable tool, wish I had gotten one years ago. Would highly recommend this unit for anyone that is serious about keeping their drill bits in top condition."
5,DD750X Drill Doctor,"I had put off buying the Drill Doctor because of the expence.Now after using it ,I should have bought it years ago. What a difference in accuracy and clean cuts. I've told everyone how well this product works."
5,750X performs as advertized,I have now sharpened several dozen drill bits with no problems. I am very satisfied with the DD 750X
1,Drill Doctor is sick!,I bought the DD750 believing I was finally getting a a good bit sharpener. Wrong! If used per instructions--the heel is too high. It took a great deal of patience to find a setting to provide proper relief--and each size drill seems to be different. Once the relief was ok--now I no longer had the angle bit I wanted.My old $19 grizzley sharpener used with a bench grinder does a better job.
4,Very pleased!,"I was 'correctly' sharpening ALL of my dull and broken bits within 45 minutes. Instructions and video was on the mark. Would give the Drill Doctor a higher score, but have not made it back to the shop to 'test' them out for proper cutting (I drill a lot of 1/4"" mild steel). I expect them to cut as new. Thanks again Amazon for the best price and QUICK shipping!!"
2,cheap sloppy machine,"This replaced an old drill doctor lost in a fire. The basic design has not changed for over a decade, but the price sure has increased. The problem with Drill Doctors is they rely on the user following a wobbly plastic guide - its very easy to not track in this guide and ruin a drill bit. Its really a cheap machine. There has got to be a better way to guide the drill bit while sharpening."
5,Excellent product,"This was a Christmas gift to my husbandand was a surprise that they wrappedthe unit even though I had not requestedit. Also, the card inside which displayed theirstaff and explained their work ethics andhistory was very impressive. The unit isan American made item and is very nice forthe money. I give this company a lot ofpraise. Signed by a Very Satisfied Customerwho would recommend purchasing this item toanyone who uses a drill."
1,Crap,Bought this in June. Gave it to dad in July. As of today after 4 bits it won't start. He studied the book and video. It has power to the switch then nada. If this is a common problem like some sites state then Amazon needs to get rid of the product.
3,profesional mechanic,"It not so impressive as I expected, especially with very small or bigger diameter. the grinder with proper wheel and the skills to sharp bits give better result. If you do not know haw to do it on grinding wheels go for it , will be ok. Hard to sharp carbide drills, takes a lot of time"
4,Cheaper than new Drill Bits,"I never realized that you could/should sharpen the drill bits. Just something I took for granted that when they're dull you throw them away. What was I thinking? You don't throw away a knife when it's dull? Anyway-a nice video comes with it to help you learn how to sharpen the bits. Despite this, it does take some patience and hands-on practice. But you'll be happy when the drill bits are sharp and biting into whatever you're drilling through."
3,Save your money,I got the Drill Doctor on 3-15-01 and tries it out immidately. It worked ok but I wasn't really impressed. I didn't know till I read the manual that sharpening increases web thickness( this means broadens the point if the bit) so bits have a wider chisle edge. Also I don't think the Split Point function works well. If I had my overs I wouldn't have bought it.
3,"Impressive, but should be improved","I am satisfied with my grinder, and it certainly puts the junk competition to shame. But I think other reviewers make a little too light of how frustrating it can be to get a bit set right in the chuck, or how easy it is to make a mistake. The bit alignment jig is simply shabby. Also, getting a good split point is more art than science. But ... if you are patient and willing to twist and turn the machine through the paces, you do get a lovely sharp bit (hopefully not having ground up too much of it in the process).A sharp tool is a wonderful thing, and being able to touch up your bits yourself will make dull bits completely intolerable, kind of like when you discovered you could sharpen those chisels, remember? :)Just be advised this tool is not a no-brainer in operation, and that it could be better."
4,The Drill Doctor,"We really like this newer Drill Doctor, seems easyer to use. We wore out the last one. Beleive this is a good sharpener for the money."
4,Driil Doc 750,"I found this product easy to use-as a professional mechanic,I need sharp drill bits almost every day. This doctor does what it says it will do-I still needed to learn how to set it up properly,so watch the DVD that comes with it-also,amazon provided the best price around and i really checked too."
5,Everything was great - thanks,Works exactly the way it should - thank you for the good service. It will be good to have for volleyball tournaments and practices.
1,Expendable Elite,"I was the Surgeon of Det. C-4 during the time this supposedly occured. DIDN""T HAPPEN. Just in case my memory was bad I talked to the former C Det. Asst. S-2 and Deputy CO of the Mike Force. He says none of this is true and that the Mike Force never went to that camp. I'm sure that LTC Marvin will say it was all TOP Secret and we just didn't know. I know that as the only medical officer at Can Tho and as one that attended all of the Commanders Conferences, there was no crash of two helicopters bringing A Team COs to the meeting."
1,This Book is Bull Biscuits!,"This book and it's author have dishonored and disrespected the entire Special Forces (SF) and Special Operations (SO) community with his endless ""fiction as fact"" accounts of SO in Southeast Asia.Having recently communicated with many real special operators (and the author's comtemporaries) over the last several days about this book, one can only conclude that the author has serious dilusions about himself as well as his former teammates and the Special Operations community at large.The ""stream of (un)consciousness"" style of writing is as sophomoric as the ""dreamland"" content.This book is pure bull biscuits...start to finish. Ask any of the men from SOG or Mike Force or SEALS or Force Recon or Air Commandos...it's all bull biscuits!"
1,pure bs,"I served in Vietnam in 1967 on A-341 Bu Dop and I am quite well read on this subject. Not only well read, but served, wounded and saw many good friends die. Nothing in this book is true, and anyone who believes it, other than the Clinton's are sick. I would suggest if in fact he is a former SF soldier should be made to prove every word he has spoken.Paul Posey"
4,excellent anthology,"Science Fiction: The Best of 2003 is an excellent anthology with most of the stories of above average quality. The best include ""A Study in Emerald"" by Neil Gaiman, a clever pastiche of both Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and H.P. Lovecraft, ""The Empire of Ice Cream"" by Jeffrey Ford about a man suffering from the strange disease synesthesia and ""The Cookie Monster"" by Vernor Vinge about new hires at a large technology firm who realize there's more to their jobs than meets the eye. The collection also features good stories by David D. Levine, James Patrick Kelly and Michael Swanwick. The stories are written in a wide variety of styles with diverse themes. Science fiction fans should find several stories that they will enjoy."
4,dj sushi - a technician,"this collection of dubplates, from the late dj sushi is some of the best scratch composition work to come out this year,there has been some contraversy over whether dj sushi ever exsisted, or whether its just an alias of one of the bay area tablist, either way it is a good short collection of hard to find work."
1,Not talent for singing coupled with bad music makes a BAD CD,"This singer does not have the voice nor the talent to sing. Picture this. Scretch your long fingers on a chalk board and that is how you will feel listening to noise that this singer makes. It is really bad. From the scale of 1-10 I give it a zero.Good luck,"
2,save your time,"I can't believe how many great reviews this book got. It's not very good, and rates my second star only because I was curious enough to finish it. The two-dimensional characters and an overly-contrived, twisted plot prove disappointing. Several plot twists are based on the easy, convenient on ""Guess what? I lied"" - now that's a cheap device, maybe nearly as bad as ""it was all a dream.""If you want a great thriller, read Michael Connelly."
2,What makes a good thriller?,"Obviously, as you can see from my rating, I don't consider this a good thriller. It does too many things that it should not.The plot is overdone and much too implausible. The surprises come like hail stones in a storm. The characters are colourful and unusual, too much of that. There is far too much melodrama. The revelations of past events are plain junk food for the mind.On top of that, the narrative concept sucks. You have a first person narrator who is in the middle of the plot, and then every few chapters, a 3rd person narrator shows up who introduces mysterious personae in mysterious circumstances, who are obviuously somehow related to the central mystery of the disappeared elder brother of the central man, and his mysterious alleged murder.I give two stars instead of one, because the author is good at twisting the tale. But then, the book is totally superfluous."
5,He has you from the first words for the first paragraph...,"When I pick up a book, my decision is made to continue the read by the first paragraph. In the case with Harlan's books, I am never disappointed. He takes you into the story right out of the gate. And the story gets better with each turn of the page, at each turn of event. You never are really sure of the end until the final page as the story twists and turns. I have read all of his books and am anxiously awaiting the next. Try them, you will like them and pass them on."
2,Not so terrific. . . .,"And it doesn't hold up to ""Tell No One."" He crams red herrings and double crosses to the point of failing any suspension of disbelief. Are we really supposed to believe a father would essentially sell his son off to prison for $5000, and that the son would turn out to be a ruthless killer (with a penchant for breaking noses)who ends up having a heart of gold? It's light summer reading- - -fast and with some excitment, but ultimately as light and airless as a summer dessert. Pick up ""Tell No ONe"" instead."
3,Book version of a lifetime movie,"""GFG"" is a fast paced novel with lots of twist and turns that keep going til the end of the book, perhaps a few too many of them than what was necessary to keep this one interesting. Its not a terrible novel, but with what i believe to be the wimpiest main character ive ever read in a book, it just reminded me of those really lame lifetime movies on the cable networks. For awhile there I kept thinking the main guy was a woman, for the over the top sensibilities and just plain wussiness that just seem to ooze from this character.Im used to reading bout guys like ""Mitch Rapp"" or ""Gabriel Allon"" so this was a major adjustment to a guy who likes ""ahem"" the male characters to be more like ""ahem again"" men.Not a bad novel, but not all that great either and wont make it to my personal ""gotta keep this one"" shelf.Like I said, it would make for a typical lifetime movie, not much more."
5,book,read the book got the tape for my husband to listen to while w travel twist at end surprised him
4,GOOD READ,"This book is fast paced, full of twists and hard to put down. I fully enjoyed it. Another book by this author I did not like at all, so he does run hot and cold."
4,Surprise ending,Book held my interest from beginning to end. Read it in one day. Thoroughly surprised by the twist at the end. I will look for more by this author.
2,Save your money and your time,"I had read two prior Coben novels: Deal Breaker (funny, entertaining) and Tell No One (good page turner). I had high expectations for this book but it came up very short. The characters weren't well developed, it's full of cheesy lines, and the story was very weak. It felt like those books that some successful authors crank out in a hurry just because they know their prior success guarantees them a certain number of copies sold. It read like it was written in a couple of weeks with poor editing or written by someone else but with Coben's name. Among the positives: At 340 pages in hardcover you can read this in one or two sittings. Save your money. Try Immoral by Brian Freeman or Tell No One from Coben instead of this."
4,a page turner,"This book is a page turner! Although it was very violent, the story was absolutely riveting. The plot was full of twists and turns that held my interest constantly. Coben is a great writer!!"
5,A really exciting read.,"This is my first Harlan Coben book & I was not disappointed. I am a fan of James Patterson, Tami Hoag, Michael Connolly & John Grisham & was looking for someone new to read. I was hooked from the first page & continued to be kept in suspense until the end of the book. Now I have a whole assortment of new reading material to get my teeth in to. My next projects are ""Just one look"" & ""No second chance"". Looking forward to being entertained again."
2,Let down,"This is the first Coben book I have read I did not like.Should be listed under Science Fiction, predictable."
5,More Twists and Turns than A Rollercoaster!!,"Whenever I read a book of this genre, I always try to figure out how it's going to end. Many times I have found that the story is predictable and it ends exactly how I think it will. Not so for this book!! With every turn of the page, I found myself questioning what I really know and what is really going on (as the protagonist does throughout the book). This story reminded me of the ""cliff hangers"" my grandfather used to tell me about that he watched as a kid. The ending of each chapter forced me to keep going, if not for curiousities sake, but also for my own sanity! To make a long review short, READ THIS BOOK!!! It will not disappoint you!!"
4,My first Coben book but definitely not my last!,"This was my first book by Harlan Coben but definitely not my last. If I ever find a moment of peace and quiet I will soon be adding his backlist to my wish list. Gone for Good had me interested from the first page to the last which is quite an accomplishment for me, the all-too-easily bored. I'm not a huge mystery fan and, to be honest, was somewhat dreading having to read this story for my suspense group because it contained so many pages (anything over 300 scares me). But it was terrific! I never knew where the plot was going to take me next and the characters were very well fleshed out and interesting and I truly enjoyed the glimpse into the world of a famous Yoga instructor (Yoga is my second addiction after books). A big draw for me was the heartrending emotionalism weaved within the story; I came close to tears on many occasions. This is a great book if you like some heart along with your suspense."
4,One of the best books for summer reading!,"Harlan Coben just keeps getting better and better. In hislatest novel, Will Klein loses his mother to cancer but getsa glimmer of hope that his supposedly dead big brother, wanted for the murderof Will's former girlfriend, is alive. Coben weaves charactersin and out of Will's life while he tries to discover the truthabout his brother and the night he ran from a murder scene.Coben is among the best of authors who can make the readerfeel what the character feels - we are drawn into Will's lifeand muddle thru the lies and frustration in his attempt toclear brother Ken and bring him home.Having read all of Coben's books thus far, I was able to guessthe truth and ending but marvel at his ability to pull offso many plot twists and surprises. Only one thing keeps mefrom giving this book 5 stars - like every book he has written,Coben's lead character is a gentle, trusting, likeable guy.He is also a wimp. A little more testosterone next time!!!"
4,Help please.,"I really enjoyed this book but can someone please help me with the ending? The ""Ghost"" put a newpaper clipping in Will's pocket referring to ""man found dead in car. Cray(sp) Spring, off-duty police officer with Cramden force, was found strangled in his car. Apparently the victim of a robbery...local police said his car was found in the parking lot behind a local bar..."". Please forgive me, but to which part of the book was this referring? I've evidentally forgotten something and can't understand the significance of this article. Please explain because it's driving me crazy!"
5,Gone for good,Don't you just love it when characters come back from the dead? Definitely worthy of christening my new kindle with!
5,Gone for Good,"WOW! What a book! Very good! Suspensful to the end, loved it and would definitely recommend to others! Now I want to read more from this author!"
3,Not bad for a light read....,"When I'm assigned books to read for school, they're often so heavy and make you think a lot. When I'm doing ""pleasure reading,"" I like enjoyable experiences that won't bend my mind too harshly.I enjoyed Harlan Coben's ""Gone for Good,"" although at times I felt the writing was too informal (like James Patterson). However, I read it faster than any other book in a long while, so that says something for it. I appreciated the plot twists, and the familial relationship within. This is the first book by Coben I've read, and I'll probably give TELL NO ONE a shot next."
1,This book was boring,"I enjoyed all of Harlan Coben's books except for ""Long Lost"" and this one, ""Gone for Good"". I couldn't get into the plot. It dragged on too much about Covenant House, prostitutes, how rough street life is. I didn't like or care for any of the characters.Very disappointed."
3,"Entertaining but Cumbersome, perhaps Farcical Plot","Coben knows how to write a suspenseful thriller. He proves that in Gone for Good. This book is a page turner, as are Coben's other books I have read; however Gone for Good consists of a plot that has too many complexities, coincidences and presumptions to swallow whole. Character attributes exist that readers just have to accept rather than question, and the characters are such that I can't imagine their actual existence and behavior as presented by Coben. This book has many twists and turns as any novel of this length. It keeps you guessing until the very end, so it is a worthwhile read, just not as satisfying as I would have hoped. It also maneuvers through some of the worst kind of characters and behavior our culture/society has to offer...not the kind of stuff that is uplifting, except for an awkward sort of suprise ""good guy"" behavior by a otherwise bad character later in the book."
2,Deja Vu,"This is my 2nd Harlan Coben book, & I'm equally disappointed. Both books have essentially the same theme, something happened years ago, a whole bunch of characters who utimately all end up interlinked (seems I'm the only one not connected to one of the characters!); really poorly defined characters & far-out twists! I'm done with Coben."
3,A bit florid but an okay read,"This was my first Harlan Coben book. I've yet to read his acclaimed Mylon Bolitar series. I didn't enjoy this book as much as other reviewers. I found the main protaganist's continuing self-effacement irritating, and his naive notions on youth homelessness and prostitution a bit preachy. There was some pseudo-philosophy thrown in for good measure early on, and this tended to grate as well. Once the writer refrained from instructing the reader, a pretty good thriller emerged. However, like Jeffery Deaver, Coben is a devotee of labyrithine plots and absurd twists, which I think takes the edge off believabilty and fails to provide the gritty realism I like in crime and thriller genres. All that aside, it's an entertaining read 7/10."
4,Good,"This was the 1st I read, than I got into the Myron series-which I may add, are totally amazing!"
4,Great Read,"Once I picked it up, it was hard to put down. Harlem Coven knows how to pull you in and keep you there until the very end."
2,Boxes Within Boxes But Who Cares,"This was an ever twisting story of things that aren't as they seem. Something new and unexpected about the protagonists is uncovered about every 20 pages. That sounds good but it sounds a lot better than it reads. I just never cared about the characters and all the twists and turns got old fast. I finished it because I was on a business trip to Lilongwe, Malawi and there wasn't a whole lot else to do."
2,Laughing Out Loud,"By the last 20 pages of this ""page turner,"" I was, literally, laughing out loud and reading passages to my annoyed co-workers. I mean -- come on. How many hairpin turns can one book take? And then, the ultimate insult for me as a reader -- a sickeningly sweet ending. It takes guts as a mystery writer to not make it all work out for the main character at the end of the book. Karin Slaughter, by the way, does that very well."
2,Master of coincidence and manipulated endings,"If you like being cheated, your logic cast away, and endings that come out of left field, this is for you. Coben's best books were his earliest."
1,good it is gone,"I have read four of Coben's novels, as I kept trying to find out why he was popular.I have still not discovered why. This book is just terribly written. Instead of just writinga good story, he tries to be crafty and creative in his twists and turns from location to location.It is plain tiresome. This book is gone for good and I could care less."
1,very annoyed,"I received an e-mail from Amazon saying that this book will be ""released"" in October. I read this book almost 10 years ago. AMazon's advertising was extremely misleading. From now on, I use my book club or Library. Amazon, you just lost a customer."
3,Very formulaic but a good read,"The beginning was a little tough to read. Coben seemed like he was trying to hard to write like a writer instead of tell a good story. The terminology and details seems...forced, a little out of place. After a while he either got into his groove or the pace and plot were exciting enough that I didn't notice his writing and was able to enjoy the story.The characters seemed familiar, but this story felt more robust than ""Tell No One"". I really enjoyed the first because it was an orignial story for me. The second book though, now familiar, felt more complex and full, more complete. I have enjoyed both books for different reasons, and would recommend each, but I think his best work is still to come.Cobens style just feels like it needs to mature a little. His writing and terminology can be so blatant that it chokes the story and the experience."
4,Quick Read,This is the first book by Mr. Coben that I've read. It was immediately engaging and a compelling read. The characters were fleshed out and the plot had enough twists to keep you guessing.
3,"Terrific mystery novel, but...","""Gone for Good"" is without a doubt terrific mystery novel. All the twists and turns keep you on the edge throughout the entire book. But it isn't quite as smooth as the author's previous efforts. Also, some of it really sounded like Myron Bolitar novel with the characters having been replaced with new ones. It is good, but not as good as earlier ones."
4,A GREAT MYSTERY!,"Lots of twists and turn, and just when you think you've got it all figured out, Coban throws you another curveball. Definitely a worthwhile read!"
5,The best yet,"I was very upset over the news of Harlan Coben's decision to temporarily shelve the Bolitar series. They were the best of its kind. Two steps above the Parker Spencer series. But all was forgiven after I had read Tell No One. A book the I personally bought 5 copies of just to give to friends. This was simply the best mystery I have every read. Until now. I have just finished Gone for Good; please don't make the mistake of thinking the last few pages of the book just ties up loose ends. From start to finish this book rocks. No longer is Tell No One the best mystery I have ever read, its now second best to Gone for Good. The only problem is I now have to buy a bunch of additional copies for my friends, so they too can read the best mystery author of our times."
3,Inspired or insipid?,"Coben's book could have gotten 5 stars; after all it is an inspiring page-turner of a mystery that is a roller-coaster of suspense. Mystery upon mystery unravels, as the story goes on, making an intriguing delight to the reader. So what brings the rating down a bit? The insipid - rather inspired - dialogue spoken between the cliched characters with names like ""Squares"" and ""Ghost"". In this day and age of mystery-thrillers can we do without the hero who's a bit too 'suave' for his own good? Can we have a tough-guy with a checkered past WITHOUT a heart of gold? Can we have an innocent suspect who at least, talks cordially to a cop? Can we have conversation between characters in place of tired, sarcastic one-liners? These flaws (slight as they may be to some) are what takes away from the originality of this book, and proves tiresome to the reader."
4,Coben's Gone For Good,"Gone For Good, by Harlan Coben is a great thriller that keeps you planted on the edge of your seat. This book is about Will who is left without his best friend in the world, his brother Ken. Is his brother dead or in hiding because of being accused for the murder of his brother's ex-girlfriend? Live Will's life by his side as he goes through a number of hardships and tries to avenge his brother's disappearance and find out what truly happened that night.Gone For Good is a great quick read that is recommended for anyone who enjoys reading suspence novels. The vocabulary is relatively simple and easy to understand. Another novel that should be read is another one of Coben's called Tell No One.The downside of this novel is the way Coben seems to introduce random characters. As the reader progresses through the book, however, he will see that mostly all of the characters fit together in one big puzzle."
2,"OH, HARLAN HOW COULD YOU?","Harlan Coben is one of my favorite writers. His Myron Bolitar series is outstanding and his first non-Myron book, ""Tell No One"" was great. So, what's wrong with ""Gone for Good?"" First of all, it is a beautifully written and plotted thriller with many, many plot twists. It's fast paced and has characters you care about..BUT and this is a big BUT..THERE IS A MAJOR PLOT FLAW EARLY ON THAT NEGATES THE POWER OF THE BOOK. So as not to spoil this for those who haven't read it yet, I won't give away the plot. But, early on in the ""Ghosts"" reminiscing, there is an incredible story about how he relished his murder, and later on, we find out something quite contrary. I've e-mailed Harlan on this all too conspicuous mistake, and am awaiting his reply. So, read the book---it's very good...but I only gave two stars because of this big, big faux pas! If anyone else out there noticed it, e-mail us and we can chat about it..."
2,What a Disappointment!,"I kept thinking this couldn't possibly get any worse, but it does. The story is filled with simply ridiculous plot twists that come out of nowhere. If that isn't bad enough the characters are completely unbelievable - a prostitute and drug addict that joins a sorority, a battered wife who receives help to go overseas from a shelter, a dad who is paid $5000 to allow his son to go to prison for a crime he didn't commit, and a ruthless killer with heart of gold. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,"I typically like Harlen Coban's work, but this is a miss...","I typiclly like Harlen Coben's work, but this one was a definate miss. This book was convoluted and confusing. There were a lot of extraneous characters & subplots that served no purpose at all. The level of detail of random thoughts and locations made the reading of the book even more excrutiating."
3,"Creative, But Dull","This book held my attention, but barely. The plot was complex and very creative, but for some reason, it wasn't compelling. Maybe it was the geography -- Livingston, NJ isn't exactly Hong Kong. Maybe it was the adolescent attitude of the protagonist, who seems to have some issues with authority figures just doing their jobs. Maybe it was the holier-than-though attitude of two characters who assist runaway teens in New York's Hell's Kitchen. I dunno. It was a good story, but it just didn't turn me on. It was my first Coben book, so I'll try him again."
4,Loved It,"I really enjoyed this book. I had been hooked on Harlan Coben's sports agent series and decided to try this stand alone book. I'm glad I did. I thought there was a lot of depth to the characters. I felt the twists in the books weren't outlandish. They actually made sense. I thought that Mr. Coben did a great job explaining the past, the present and how they all went together. He led you down the path about two characters and then show you how everything isn't always what it seems. I thought it was fast paced enough to keep my attention and didn't take long to read at all. I would highly recommend this stand alone book along with Coben's sports agent series."
5,One of the most entertaing books I have read,"I made a mistake after I read this book in that I lent it out only to realize later that my copy was not going to be returned. I went out and bought another copy to keep for myself and to read again.Buy this book and enjoy it. It will be one of the best reading experiences you have enjoyed. Plot twists, suspense, an unexpected ending. Read this book on the weekend. You won't want to put it down."
5,"Wow,just read it...","Wow,this book is amazing.the suspense and the many twists in the plot are shoking time after time.thsi is a Great great book! i start the reading in friday night and finish the book on saturday night.A little more than 24 hours...if you're looking for a great thriling non-stop twists book,this is the one for you."
3,Gone for Good,Will has always lived with the shadow of his brother's infamy hanging over him. His first girlfriend was murdered and the latest one has disappeared. Has Ken been hiding out for all of these years or is he dead?
4,GOOD READ!!! Audiobook.,"Really enjoyed it.Caught my attention and kept my attention...a must have for an audiobook.I wanted to know what was going to happen next.I love HC's Myron Bolitar series..they are suspenseful and funny.A few of his stand alone novels are good as well. This one, Tell No One, No Second Chance, Just One Look, The Woods.Some of the other ones are just a burden to listen to."
1,Picture is very bad. it jumps,"I bought this as a gift for my father from amazon. Don't know if it is good for oil painter as I know nothing about it. However the quality of the DVD is very bad. The picture either jumps or stands still. Not just a few minutes. The entire DVD. basically it is un watchable. Thought it was my DVD player, tried various other players including my laptop. Nothing works. Don't know if we can return it as the DVD is opened."
4,LEGO TIE FIGHTER Review,"First of all, this set is NOT ACCURATE TO THE FILM. In Return of the Jedi, which is the first time that this ship appears, it's color scheme is mostly black, with a grey frame. the color scheme on the LEGO version however, is mostly black, with a blue frame. All you've got to do, is replace all of the blue pieces, with grey pieces, and it's pretty accurate. Also, the little red pieces on the window, should not be there, so I took them off. I replaced most of the dark grey pieces with light grey pieces, to match the film. So like I said, not accurate to the film, but pretty darn cool. A lot of people talk about it taking them a long time to build LEGO sets. This set took me about five to seven minutes. Four stars..."
3,fantastic build but boring toy,"The SW TIE Interceptor is great fun when you're building it. Playing with it is boring because there are few features to play with. The wings move and the window to the cockpit opens but that is it. For fun play, I recommend the Alpha Team mobile command center. I am a nine year old LEGO fan."
3,Too Fragile for child play,"The detail on this model is excellent and it has all of the features you would expect on a lego model. Unlike other sets this one is very fragile so stick to the age on the box, your younger child will break it apart with every touch. And that really is my only gripe, it is just not a play toy, this is more of a display item so keep that in mind when making your purchase. The lego's from this model have since been incorporated into the general pile becaue the Intercepter was never fun for my son to play with."
3,Nothing like the picture.....,"I received my fire pit within a reasonable time, however, it looks nothing like the picture..I purchased this particular item because of the unusual finish & when it arrived the finish is a cheap black paint with some orange showing thru...I am very disappointed."
3,Color not as pictured,"Color is not at all like the photo. It's a dark brown with some orange showing through. It still looks nice but not what I expected. I had a clay stove before and decided to try one with a view of the fire all around. Only problem is that the smoke goes every where instead of up. Good way to keep bugs away but hard on your eyes. Ordered it with super savers shipping. Was told it would take four weeks to arrive. Recieved it in just one week. Nice surprise. Ok item but wouldn't purchase it again.Update, it lasted two years and ended up in the junk pile."
3,disapointed,"When the box came, it was over half ripped open. I thought it was either a return or someone opened it and I may have missing parts. It took a long time to assemble. The color was not at all what I expected (black and rust color as opposed to beige and gold) to match my deck which is why I ordered it. I expected the functional burning grill to be larger. Its measurements were from the outside of the grill. The ash drawer does not fit and I guess I will have to take it apart somewhat to enable it to fit. The drawer is about 1/16"" too wide to slide in. I do like the shape of the fire pit."
1,Why can't it be packaged better,"I ordered this fire pit to have for a special birthday party. However, it came broken and dented and chipped. There is not enough time to order a replacement unit. Too bad the packaging can't be more robust. This is a 100 lb unit, and it comes in a flimsy cardboard box, poorly padded.I was really looking forward to having this unique pit at my party."
4,Beautiful,"The fire pit is beautiful. I love the finish on it. Easy to put together, and a nice addition to the patio."
5,POWERFUL!,The author had me from page one! We jump right into the action and find ourselves involved in a tragic love story. I couldn't help rooting for the author and her first love. The message of keeping things to ourselves and not dealing with issues and the consequences rings so true in our throw-away society. We learn to see the good and bad in people.A powerful book that I'd recommend to anyone who cares about anyone.
1,what are you talking about,"i got this piece of crap to clean the stains on my wall, fridge and oven it did not do anything. It seems to only clean things that are not that very dirty to begin with. To me it seems like a overprice foam pad."
1,no tokyo no x no erotica,"Visited Tokyo not once I can say there is no Tokyo in movie.There is city,any city but not Tokyo.Movie do not nave any plotand concenrate on some soft-core porn.So,why bother call itx erotica?Who knows."
2,What a disappointment!,"This looked like a lot of fun - on the computer. In reality, the canvas is a small (9""x11""?) board which has way too many small areas to fill in with paint. Too difficult for my 9 year old daughter and really, too diificult for me. Also, there was not nearly enough paint included to complete this project. Not worth the time, energy or money."
5,kmk rock my world,I love the kmk. i was 13 when i first heard them and i've been hooked ever since.LThis was the first cd i ever heard and i think the best. they are so good in concert i am about to see them again on aug 16 and cant wait. another great plus to liking the kmk is all the cute guys that like them too. great plus!!well to all the kmk fans peace not greed!
5,who couldn't give em 5 stars aye?!!?,"How can ya go wrong with kmk?? I've been waiting for this for months now and i'm far from disappointed!! What can i say - THE ALBUM IS.... MADNESS!! Good werk yet again fella's!! Luvin ALL ABOUT THE WEED, PAID VACATION, TELL ME WHY, WELCOME TO THE SUBURBS...HECK THE WHOLE ALBUM!! Keep up the good werk, peace :)"
2,do not get this trimmer.,"my roommate bought this when the ol' reliable black and decker electric trimmer gave up the ghost after years of abuse.this trimmer is heavy, poorly balanced, and way too long if you are under 6' tall. it does not hold much string, runs out easily, and is a pain to reload (you cut two 10' lengths of line, thread them in, and turn the head until it loaded). it also is very difficult to disassemble the cutting assembly to unjam jammed line or if you twist too far while loading the the ends disappear. I can barely finish edging my front drive and sidewalk with one load, let alone the other edging tasks; and I am on an average suburban lot.i only gave it two stars instead of one because it is quite powerful and the two lines sticking out make short order of weeds (before they quickly run out, of course)."
4,Bobby & The Binx,"I bought this CD 4 years ago while traveling in Germany, and I still break it out on a regular basis. The bass is deep and pure. There is a uniqueness about it that that makes it stand out. Not a substitute if you know what I mean."
4,Beautiful Shoe - Runs Small,"Beautiful shoes of great quality! The shoes run small. I ordered a half size larger than normal, and the shoes were still tight around the toes (I have narrow feet). Great shoes, but you may want to order a larger size than normal!"
5,Also Good,"I own 8 of the 250GB version of this drive (which has been extremely good to me) and I was about to get 2 more when I found this one. As expected, it is almost identical to the smaller size version except with twice the disk space. However, I did notice that the power supply is not interchangeable with the smaller version, and the on-off switch is push-button instead of toggle. Also, if I turn the power off, the disk does not automatically mount on my Mac when I turn the power back on which is different from the 250GB version - I have to manually mount it using disk utility. I'm not sure what that's about, but since I usually just leave it on, that doesn't really affect me. I've had several of the 250GB (firewire) version of this disk running non-stop for over two years so I'm optimistic I'll have similar luck with these. I've been using the 500GB version for a couple of weeks now and haven't noticed any performance problems relative to the smaller-size one. So far so good..."
5,Go for it !,"As a user of other models of Lacie HD's it is very easy for me to recommend this product.I bought this unit in May 2007 and after 3 months of use I must say that the performance is excellent. Porsche design is simple and ellegant in spite of the thickness compared with the smaller units.I am astonished with the data transfer speed, I can find my data much faster in this external HD than in the factory installed Superdrive of my Mac when I use a data DVD 4.3 GB.I already used this unit with XP and Vista and the connection was as simple as it was with Mac OSX 10.4.10I highly recommend this unit over the other brands, go for it !"
5,Feeding Frenzy - Great Book! Great Read!,"Feeding Frenzy - Great Book! Great Read!I really enjoyed this book, once I started reading it was hard to put it down. I am sooooooooooo glad that I have come in contact with Jonathan Luckett and his books!"
5,Incredible- You won't be able to put it down,Feeding Frenzy is an amazing novel. The imagery and emotion makes you want read more and more. I stayed up all night reading it. Jonathan is an talented author and I can't wait to read more. Thanks for introducing us to Scott Chase.
1,Arrived Damaged,This item was placed at the bottom of my doorstep in a ripped boxed that clearly should not have been delivered. Parts were wedged together from the damage.Also the image displayed is not the shade or color of the item received.I would not order this item online....
1,received broken 2 times,"I wish I could review thihs product fairly. I ordered this and it arrived with the box looking like it fell out of an airplane. I opened the box and the item was cracked and had pieces that were broken off. I went online and did a damaged item exchange. They said they would pack the next one better. Yes, it was better, the box only looked like it had fallen off a truck. There were not as many broken pieces. I returned it again and asked for a refund."
2,Printer Problems,"I own both Wordperfect 9 and 11 and find that 9 is superior. Apparently in Wordperfect 11, Corel revamped the way the software interfaces with printers so all of the features of my printer (a new model Hewlet Packard Laserjet) do not work without going through several steps in the page setup. Further, Wordperfect 11 freezes up if one uses the latest printer drivers and only works with older versions of drivers. Plus, I bought the product with the understanding that it automatically converts batches of old wordperfect files. I have many documents in wordperfect 4.2 and 5.1. However, Wordperfect 11 does not convert batches of old files in 4.2 and 5.1. Other than above, the software is fine but you may as well stick to version 9 which is fabulous."
3,No image preview in this version,"When I tried to insert an image into a document in WP 11 I got the error message ""no viewer available."" Several hours of repairing, uninstalling and reinstalling, and a phone call to Corel support later, I find out that this is NOT an error. WP used to include QuickView Plus, but Corel was not able to bundle it with WP 11. So there are no image viewers inside the program. If you work with images, beware!"
1,Item never received.,"I never received the product. They claim it was shipped and delivered. If it was, it was not to this office. Actually, no stars could rate a product I never received. I most likely will never order again from this site.Sandra zendell"
1,WP Office 11 and 3x not compatible with Windows Vista?,"Through no fault of the seller, WP Office 11 and WP Office Suite 3x and not yet compatible with Windows Vista, at least according to the tech folks at Corel software.I purchased WP Office 11 with Quattro Pro 11 and was very pleased with the seller. The product was as advertised and timely. But it didn't work with Windows Vista! I know it's and old program, but I have 5 years of spreadsheets in that format.I also downloaded WP Office 3x trial version and it tries not to work correctly either.Corel Software, are you reading this?"
2,WP office 11 Mixed Value,I purchased WP Office 11 to upgrade my Corel WP 6.0. Quattro Pro worked for one week and then I started receiving a runtime error opening program. Corel's technical support was not helpful - really none. I can use WP with good results but not Quattro Pro. The good news was that the costs was only $19.95. If one is running Vista best not to purchase.
2,Verification,"Corel WordPerfect Office 12 Standard [OLD VERSION]It is very old, and unable to verify using Serial # printed on insert. It's fine to just use for fun, but I am disappointed, as it is not user friendly."
3,Software purchase,"The product arrived very quickly, was packaged nicely and in great shape. It was different than I expected, as it was not the original version of the Wordperfect software that I expected. However, it did include many other pieces of software that I did not expect (an added bonus). The first computer installation went fine, no problems, however the second installation on Vista was unsuccessful. I am not sure if this was the software or not. I have mixed feelings about the product, but I paid very little for the software, so I do feel that I got my money's worth."
4,Volcano The Bear - 'The One Burned Ma' (Misra Records),"First complete title I've heard from this experimental / improv band from Leicester, UK. Tunes that sort of had me sit up and take some notice were ""The Colour Of My Mind"", the odd (yet good) ""Reah's Mort"", ""Salt"", ""Expert"" (reminds me of the Residents), ""Wood Frong Pond"" and the seven-minute ""Digging The Opera"". Line-up: Nick Mott-guitar, sax & vocals, Daniel Padden-keyboards, guitar, clarinet & vocals, Clarence Manuelo-tapes & electronics and Aaron Moore-drums, trumpet & vocals. Should definitely do something for fans of Nurse With Wound, Faust, Red Krayola, Jackie-O Motherf***er and maybe - later Circle material."
4,stephen stapleton's favorite band,"anything beloved of the NURSE WITH WOUND guru has to be worth checking out, right? good old-fashioned instrumental experimentalism!"
4,Great debut album but nothing can compare to YOSLY.,"I am a HUGE Matchbox20 fan and YOSLY is my favorite album, being the only one that i can listen to all the way through without skipping songs, but Don't Play With Matches Comes in second. I have to admit that when I first heard it I was not very enthusiastic about it. The songs are a little slower than YOSLY for the most part. They have a different sound. But songs like 'Dear Joan', 'Swing', and the extra track 'Dizzy' are so beautiful that I can not help but love it. If you are a fan of Matchbox20 on any level then I recommend you buy this CD. Give it a chance to grow on you and I am sure you will love it."
3,"Well, it's not TOO terrible....","I'm not a huge Matchbox 20 fan, but my wife is. She dragged me to their concert and they're growing on me. This CD, however, is way-more ""low-key"", and Rob's voice sounds pretty different than with MB20....kinda like he was getting voice lessons and trying too hard to sound a certain way. If you are a bona-fide MB20 ""FREAK"", though, you might find it halfway enjoyable. I really think, though, that it's just his old ""jilted"" band members' poor attempt to snag a lil' of the limelight from MB20 (and actually get paid). Maybe play it in the background and let it ""grow"" on you until MB20 comes out with some NEW stuff."
5,TABITHA'S SECRET- DON'T PLAY WITH MATCHES -CD,"As an avid, longtime fan of Rob Thomas I feared I would be unable to find these early recordings but once again AMAZON rules. My CD was shipped in a timely fashion and the pricing was great.I will cherish it forever.I have purchased gifts from AMAZON for friends and family members and have never been disappointed.Thanks!"
5,A Great CD from 3 of music's familiar faces.,"Tabitha's Secret is an awesome CD. You may recognize a lot of things off of it because 3 of the band members now make up Rock Sensation, Matchbox 20. It's a great early attempt by lead singer, Rob Thomas and something you definately should pick up."
4,Before MB20,"This is a good cd. It is a great addition to the collection of any MB20 fan, although it doesnt compare to MB20 and their newer cds. This cd by Rob Thomas' previous band, Tabitha's Secret, has some incredible songs, in which Rob sounds great!! His voice is very different, less raspy, which gives a different feel to 3AM making it sound pure and beautiful. There are some random songs that seem like filler (i.e. Jesus was an Alien) but there are also some great songs that can't be found on MB20's other cds. i.e. Forever December, Dear Joan, and the hidden track Dizzy. It also has my all time favorite song ""here comes horses."" Overall i give the cd 4 stars."
5,I love it!,I found this music very relaxing and addictive. I put it on repeat and let it play all night while I'm sleeping. I've just ordered more by this author and can't wait until they get here.
4,Chopin pot pourri,This album is mostly awesome. I particularly enjoyed the shorter works such as the Fantasy Impromptu. I have never been a fan of Chopin's Concertos. He is indeed the master of the smaller works. I would have rather heard the 2nd sonata on this recording. I had heard Ms Kern play the fantasy in recital and had to have this recording. She is quite the showman in concert but her interpretations are very musical on disc.
3,"a certain poetry, perhaps, but a highly distorted view of chopin","painful, really, this playing, especially in the first movement. after having heard (and known) rubinstein, i found this terribly hard to listen to. far too mannered, as if the phrases couldn't be trusted to speak for themselves. think of this as late frank sinatra, when he'd lost contact with the purity of the interpretive art. the second movement was pretty good, though."
5,LONG AWAITED REPLACEMENT FOUND,"ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM ""DM RECORDS"" I CAN LISTEN TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NEVER GET BORED OF WHAT I'M LISTENING TO. THANK YOU------ROBERT"
3,Translationally Challenged,"A brilliant book by a wonderful author, this deserved a more thoughtful translation. Many of Buzzati's ideas don't translate easily, but in this version even familiar cycling phrases become muddled by direct, word-for-word translation. By all means, if you love Italy or bicycles or bicycle racing, buy this book, but take your time reading - some paragraphs become clear only after a bit of mental rewriting."
5,Execellent Everybody Book,"This book is a heart-warming, couragous story. I found myself smiling and by the end, shedding a few tears! What a great story about life, relationships, feelings and more. A must read for anyone!!"
5,Review of Judevine,Judevine is a must have for any avid reader of poetry. Budbill has a unique ability to capture the momment and freeze it in time. You'll Love it! He has become one of my favorite writers.
3,EFC,"Earth final conflict was one of my favourite shows on TV, and even I must admit that something went terrible wrong in the way, a clear example of that is the last season: the acting is extremely poor, you can't even buy the Taelon act because is too cheesy, the Atavus are a terrible replacement for the Taelons and even the main characters look tired and acting just because they get paid for that.I definitely don't recommend this set box if you are a hard core fan, the fourth season was a lot better and still has that spark that made the show interesting on early seasons."
4,Season 5,"I believe this is Season Five. It's hard to understand, but for some reason the first two seasons are not being released as of yet, something to do with ownership, if I am not mistaken. This is a great set, but there are so many extras which could have been included on this set, but considering its low price, we got a deal."
3,Seasons 1 & 2,"Really don't know how to rate this item. I purchased Seasons 3,4,&5 a couple of years ago, but haven't even watched them yet, because I was waiting for Seasons 1&2 to come out. Does anyone know if they are out or if they are coming out? It kind of stinks if not. I'd rather watch it from the beginning, or I wasted money buying 3,4,&5."
1,oh no!!!!!!!!!!!,"like in almost every sci-fi serials the last season is the worst one. babylon 5 etc. and we don't have an exception in this one.i couldn'tbelive it when i read the reviews of the others. luckily they were cheap, cause i bought the seasons 3,4 and 5 and i have to admit, that the 4th one is the best one.still hoping to get the first two season to complete the whole series, but if you want to preservate your eyes, don't buy this season!!!"
4,1000 never seem so long,"This truly will tip over your personal barrel of monkeys. Filled with laughs on every page. Reading this will help you not only bring a small chuckle but help write your own jokes. Take this anwhere. Its quick comentary for any situation can't be beaten. This is a must have for the party entainer, party goer, or just for a few laughs around the house. I garuntee that you won't put it down. Even if you do it will just to applaud its insurmountable humor. Get it before you miss all the fun waiting for you in between the covers."
3,"Nice fit, but sticks too far out from belt.","While the case itself is a nice fit, my wife and I ended up not using this because it sticks way too far out from our belts."
3,JYD FBI LOL,"Allegedly based on ""true events"", JUNKYARD DOG is an occasionally enjoyable look at a psychotic serial killer who also likes digesting his prey. Posing as a good samaritan tow truck driver, JYD kidnaps, rapes, tortures and prepares his victims as his dinner. He is aided by his vicious German shepherd who gets rewarded with chunks of JYD's victims.The always unreliable and inept FBI is embodied by Viveca A. Fox, who deservedly seems embarrassed in her role. The scene in the country line-dancing bar is comically staged as well. Brad Dourif has a small role as the local law enforcement who outclasses the special agent. Innis Casey plays JYD with haunting stares and an occasional sneer but unconvincing menace.The movie is not overtly graphic and the bloodletting is minimal, a refreshing change from films like the WRONG TURN franchise.As usual, after the finale, there's a quick scene suggesting all is not well.JUNKYARD DOG is not a terrible film, but it won't be long remembered either!"
2,Where's Qbert?,"His name is on the title, but he is nowhere to be found in the video. Volume 1 was one of the best video's for beginning DJ's and when I got volume 2 I was so upset it didn't take what you learned in Volume one to the next level."
1,not worth your money,"i had this DVD given to me as a gift. To my surprise i couldn't believe how silly and rediculous it is. there were no instructions how to improve your DJ skills. Being honest with you, it appear to be more of a comedy DVD. people running round in mask, an hand appearing from god knows scratching on the deck and much more... in a but shell they don't take themselves serious on this DVD so don't bother buy it...."
2,Annoying Voice & Breathing,"I had the hardest difficulty following the instructor in the video because the way he spoke and breathed in. It's very irritating. For this video, you need a step. I just forward to the end and do the yoga."
4,Definitely a Complete Workout,"This video starts out with a cardio segment and then segues into a weight training workout. The production is off, with Keith figuring out the next cue while the women in the video have started the next exercise. It is a rigorous workout, made for an advanced level since there is little or no instruction. The music isn't that great and you can hardly hear it. So, don't get it if you expect a high energy motivational video, get it if you are disciplined and up for an intense workout."
3,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good workout. I have been doing cardio and strength training for about two years and I had a hard time getting through this video. It really works your entire body, Nevertheless, I do wish the cardio/aerobic segment was a little more intense. I hardly broke a sweat during this segment. Furthermore, I thought that the instructor's sound effects and constant chatter was a bit much, but as I continued with the video, it became easier to ignore him. I recommend this video if you want an intense total body workout, I really felt it the next morning. However, I would supplement it with another cardio/aerobics video. Try Kathy Smith's Kickboxing workout."
4,Excellent total body athletic workout,I'm not a big fan of working out to a video tape..i'd rather be outside running! But I actually enjoy this work out. It is an athletic one-hour total body workout. The only downside is the leaders annoying sound effects. I simply turn down the sound.
4,SOLID PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE ZOOM RANGE,"I bought the Minolta Maxxum 24mm-85mm f3.5-4.5 lens used in excellent condition for my Minolta 7d which came with the 18-70mm D f3.5~5.6 kit lens, which seemed a bit too plastic. The 24mm-85mm feels like a real lens! Although the 24mm-85mm doesn't have as wide angle capability, it is much more consistantly sharp across the zoom range and also from the center to edge of the image. I would rate this lens good to very good across the zoom range and f stops. I also get a brighter viewfinder image with the faster 24-85 lens at the long end. I like this lens and IMO the 24-85mm is optically and mechanically superior to the 18-70mm lens, which I would rate only fair-good. - the glassman"
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed,Great CD - definitely worth it if you like good old fashioned rock 'n' roll... I can't stress enough how good the CD is. You have to check it out though... You won't be disappointed.
5,This stuff realy works ask any caveman,I have been using sundance alovera for years and am lost without it. Give it a try you will be satasfied.
5,Excellent quality Canon paper,Excellent quality Canon paper. Feeds through the printer great; no jams and produces excellent quality photo prints.
4,Cambodian Rock Vol 1,Cambodian Rocks Volume 1 ROCK! I enjoys the CD very much. Before I knew a fews Cambodian popular singers but after purchasing this CD I have heard more songs and know more name of the Cambodian popular singers. Awesome CD!
5,A Lifetime of creative insight.,"It quickly became obvious that the author has studied this subject during a lifetime of research and contemplation of his observations, in extreme detail. I was continually amazed and delighted with the novel references to my own movements and thoughts in everyday life, and how mental actions have evolved from simple life forms to human complexity. And his creative explanation of how we perform subconscious actions called FAPs (fixed action plans) by neurons, to conserve mental time and attention, was memorable. This is a multiple read book."
2,Not an insider,"Wouldn't it be interesting to know what really goes on inside Fidelity? They own every company in America and their proxies ought to control the outcome of every boardroom battle, what a subject! Plus, this is one man's creation and certainly a discussion of who he is and what he does would be interesting.But, no. Unfortunately, you can't look here for much of any insight into any of these subjects. Too bad."
4,A clear view of the explosive growth of mutual funds,"The book gives a broad and clear view of the growth of the mutual fund industry in the United States and the consequences it has to the investors, shareholders and managers of the public quoted corporations. However, it rambles on sometimes, making the reader forget that the book is about Fidelity and the dangers a company of such size pose due to the power it holds trough the family of funds it has, unless it is adequately regulated and overseen. Anyway it is a great reading for anybody interested in the development of the mutual fund industry. Congratulations to Diana B. Henriques"
3,"Love it, if only it would fit our crib!","I got this toy for my baby shower and think it's great. The music is soothing, the motor isn't too loud (unlike the new ocean wonders acquarium which I also received.) I also like the idea of the picture projecting onto the ceiling. The only problem - the straps to attach it to the crib are not long enough to fit around the rails of our Ragazzi crib! The new acquarium has straps that are plenty long, but the motor on that toy is loud and I don't like it as much as the birdies soother. Augh! To sum it up, this is a great crib toy, as long as your crib doesn't have very thick/wide rails. . ."
5,My son LOVES this!,"We have really enjoyed our flutterbye soother. I wanted it as a music box for my son to help him fall asleep at night/naptime. Turns out he LOVEs the light show and now he often doesn't cry at all at bedtime. Bird ended up being one of his first words...he said it as he pointed to the music box. When he was a little older it was easy for him to learn how to turn on by himself, and now he turns it on in the morning when he wakes up. I would highly recommend this toy to others."
2,Aquarium did a better job,"My daughter had the older Fisher Price Aquarium in her crib and it was great with the lights and music option. We saw the Lullabye Birdies Soother at the store and loved the look and the light show feature. But once we put it in her crib, the light show also included the rotation and the motor was way too loud. It kept her up rather than lulled her to sleep!!We still have it and the kids play with it but it's not used to soothe them to sleep. I might use this one for my youngest baby who is 3 months since she might grow accustomed to the engine noise but for my other daughter, it was just too loud to what she was used to so the Aquarium stays with her."
4,I love it,"I just bought this for my son, even though he's 20 months. I wanted him to have something else to play with along with the Ocean Wonders and Gloworm crib toys. I love it. It's so cute and relaxing. The projection onto the ceiling is very clear. We love it."
2,"Good, but not the Best","We bought our son when he was a newborn the Oceanarium that would play for 10-15 min or so. He is 2 1/2 and still uses it to sooth him to sleep and he is an ANGEL when it comes to bedtime/going to bed. We bought the Flutterbye for our 2nd child bc I though it looked ADORABLE but the projection lights shine only 3/4 of the show on the ceiling, the rest is on the wall no matter HOW you posotion it on the crib (baby doesn't seem to mind that at all though) but I wish it would play longer. Some nights when it takes her longer than ""8"" minutes to fall asleep she gets upset when it shuts off too soon and she's not asleep yet."
4,Sweet Dreams,"I bought this for my baby out of sentimentality to the orignial Fisher Price Bluebird toy I had as a child. The music is very good and I like how many choices there are, it was always easy to turn on in the dark room in the middle of the night if he woke up and it would help sooth him back to sleep. Now that my baby is crawling, he moves himself over to it and turns it on which is nice because I can always tell that he is awake. My older kids even have fun playing with the projection portion of this toy. The only drawback is that sometimes the bluebirds make a grinding noise when they go around, but it does not seem to bother my baby."
5,Soothing,"This product is great when you want something soothing in the crib for your baby to go to sleep to. The music really is perfect for that, not overly-stimulating and obnoxious like some other toys. The little chirping birds are sweet-sounding too. We got this for our 6-month old, since she was getting too old for a mobile, (safety reasons, you know). Instantly, putting her down for sleep became less ""traumatic."" :) The light show is an added bonus, and we have had no problem putting it on either side of the crib. Our other children like it too! And when the baby outgrows the crib, we'll just do like the instructions say and place it on a dresser for them to enjoy later. It's really a great price for such a well-made product! There is also a button on the side that faces baby which is large enough for them to press when they get old enough to learn to do it themselves. This would be a great gift for any new parent! My ""manly-man"" husband doesn't even get annoyed with the gentle music! :)"
5,Wonderful product!,"My sister bought this for my daughter right after she was born. Some nights it was the only thing that would soothe her back to sleep when she woke up. Now she is 14 months old and still loves her birdies soother! If I don't turn it on when I put her to bed she will turn it on herself! She has also figured out how to change the song that is playing and has one in particular that seems to be her favorite. I thought that this was really cute, but didn't really think that it would still be entertaining my daughter over a year later. Now I have to get a second one in three months when our next baby is born because I don't think my daughter will part with it! Excellent investment!"
4,Wonderful attention-keeper,"The songs, colors, sounds are all great to keep my little one's attention."
1,works BUT not for long!!,"My daughter absolutely loved this item but it stopped working within 2 weeks. I exchanged it for another thinking I had a faulty one but two exchanges later, same thing. GREAT product if it would last!!"
2,Product Broke Twice,When I first received the Lullabye Soother I thought it was adorable but shortly after attaching it to the crib the lightshow stopped working. Fisher Price was nice enough to send me a new one but that one too did not display the overhead images. They finally sent me a refund check so I am more than happy with their customer service but disappointed with this product. I also found the movement of the birds to be rather loud and almost drowned out the music.My son didn't seem to miss it when I removed it from his crib and loved his mobile more than this anyway.
2,doesn't last more than a few weeks,"my daughter loved the flutterbye dreams soother, but it doesn't last long at all. I have returned the item to the store 4 times and got a new one each time and none of them worked. The first one the sound stopped working, I put in new batterys didn't help. The second one the ceiling lights stoped working changed the batterys didn't help. Third one the birds stopped moving changed the batterys didn't help. Fourth one the inside lights where the birds are stopped, of course I changed the batterys each time with new batterys and I tried the batterys on other toys to see if the batterys or ok and the batterys was ok. Ive been through 4 of flutterbye dreams soothers and I just gave up and got a different brand, I got Vtech soother and haven't had any problems with it."
2,so cute but will not last,I received this 5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child. I loved how the birdies were projected onto the ceiling and I loved how sweet the music sounded. It wasn't too loud and my son loved it. After he outgrew it I took the batteries out and stored it carefully. Now that my second child is due to be born in a few weeks I took this soother out of the closet and put new batteries in it. The only thing that works is the music and lights. The birds no longer move and the light show does not project. Such a bummer. They just don't build things to last anymore. So while it did last for about a year with my first child it no longer works and I don't know why. I just think these baby items should last through more than one baby.
2,Cute but doesn't last long.,I thought this toy was adorable & bought it for my daughter for Christmas & the sound went out after about a month of being attached to her crib. There's no chance of the toy being damaged causing it to break. It still lights up & she enjoys that. I'm a little disappointed.
3,Maybe for older babies,"I bought this searching for help getting my 6 week old to fall asleep on her own. She was entertained by it, but I didn't buy it for entertainment, I have plenty of things for that. I think maybe if she was older it would be relaxing. I just wanted to post for those of you with little bitty ones to know that it may not be the cure all for your sleep deprived life!"
2,"Great for sleeping, but these birds don't fly.","I loved this toy for our baby girl. The music is precious and she really enjoyed watching the little birds move. After several months, the only thing that works is the light and music. It no longer moves even after changing batteries. I've found this with the fish toy as well. Love the music, but not life of the toy."
4,kinda noisy,My 4 and 2 year old kids even love this toy. But the engine that makes this turn is rather noisy and you can't hear the music when it's on the lowest setting because of that. Overall a very cute toy and entertaining for nighttime.
5,A Must Have,This is a wonderufl item to have in baby's room. My son loves it. I keeps his attention and plays long enough for him to fall asleep. It has been a life saver. I wish they had this when my daughter was born.
5,This toy is a dream,"My daughter adores her Flutterbye Dreams. She knows how to activate it, and when she does she puts on the biggest, brightest smile and squeals with delight. It has many great features. The music and nature sounds are soothing enough to help my daughter fall asleep. And it has a volume control button. You can play the music with lights or without the lights. It also projects pictures onto the ceiling, and that is my favorite feature of them all. I think I love this toy just about as much as my daughter does! It is just darling."
5,crib toy,i bought the ocean wonders for my little girl and she loved it she went right to sleep everytime! i live outside the united states as i am a military wife and when i went back to the states for a visit i found this one at a second hand store and i immediately fell in love with it. i knew my daughter would like it and when i found out that it projected on the ceiling i thought EVEN BETTER!!! i brought it home and now she has the ocean wonders and the birds attached to her crib and she loves the birds. she plays with them both all the time. NO FUSSING when she takes a nap or its bedtime. i put her down and she plays with them until she is ready to lay down and she puts herself to sleep. I would recommend this toy for everyone! the projection is awesome! i have noticed that a lot of toys that project are not that good but this one is AWESOME!! WE LOVE IT!
5,Wonderful item!,"We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since. We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way, and she just wouldn't part with it. My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night. (Almost 22 months old).I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby, but the prices people are asking here are outrageous."
5,Great,"This is a great CD. It has a nice mix of intrumentals. I have been taking guitar lessons from him for almost a year now and I enjoy going. He is a very talented guitarist, although this CD is the fisrt time I have heard him on other instruments I have gained even more respect for him as a musician. The giutar in the CD is great. My favorite song is probably the title song ""Ain't Complicated."" It's worth the eleven dollars."
1,In a word? BLECCH.,"Spectacularly unfunny, bland, stupid and opportunistic piece of drivel masquerading as a work of ""fiction"".Whilst alive, Robbins was a mediocre writer who made millions with potboilers that catered to the ignorant. Now, in death, his ""work"" is taken to (if such thing is possible) a new level of degradation and abysmal cheapness.This is a waste of money and time.Ugh!"
2,So Pointless It's Funny,"These are short, pointless stories that seem to come right off the top of the author's not-so-creative head. It includes such classics as the children that received a 6-foot sausage from their grandma, and the same children who later give their grandma a photograph taken with the lens cap on the camera. So ridiculous it's hilarious."
5,most fun Christmas ever!!!,We purchased this last Christmas from Sam's Club (at a deeply discounted price) for our then 9 year old son. It ended up being the biggest party ever. The quality is superb. Buy some classic oldies and crank it up. I have some priceless video of my 62 year old father singing Chantilly Lace. I love this because it is (1) not a video game (2) everybody can play (3) it is entertaining for my son when he plays by himself. I highly recommend this. I don't think we can beat last year's Christmas.
1,"Once, twice a bad purchase","Had to return this item twice due to malfunctioning microphones. We bought it for a friend's family of three girls, as a Christmas present. Needless to say, they were disappointed more than once."
2,Was great when it worked,"I purchased this karaoke machine for my wife for Christmas. It just took a few minutes to assemble, and we were up and singing in minutes. Very easy to use, decent sound and a nice picture from the little camera.Unfortunately, the next time we tried to use it, it wouldn't power up. Tried it in multiple outlets (no, we weren't in the middle of a blackout), and did the obligatory jiggling of all the wires and double checking connections, but no little red light to signify receipt of power.Had to return it, luckily Amazon had extended it's return policy to January for items purchased in November. Had no problem returning and received my refund from Amazon promptly. Wouldn't give it 1 star because it was a nice system but it would have been a higher rating had it continued to work properly."
3,OK - But Not much more than toy status,"Paid a little extra to get the higher model expecting better sound. Unfortunately sound is not any better than a much cheaper model. Unit is fairly solid, does have an issue playing CDs as music skips and lags fairly regularly. Have not contacted company yet for help, will see how the service is on problems and report back. Overall not a bad little toy and the kids are OK with it - but don't expect much more performance than you would get from a lower price model."
1,didn't last a half hour,we had problems with this almost right out of the box. none of the buttons worked on the machine or remote after very little use.
1,DOA,"We ordered this item for a suprize christmas gift. When it came time to power it up, the front panel buttons did not work. The only way to turn it on is the remote control. The unit is very light, and NOT worth the money. I decided to send this gimmick back and get a better quality machine. Yuck. Dont buy this one. Its a PITA."
2,Watch out,"Greetings all. I purchased this machine almost 2 years ago. For the most part I really liked it, it served my purpose. HOWEVER..... the sub-woofer quit working about 1 week after the warranty expired and of course they do not ""fix"" anything at the company. I gave the two stars only because the item worked for a time. The company on the other hand will not stand by their product. Their integrity is highly questionable in my opinion. Now the machine sounds like a 2 dollar Walmart special.I am looking for anyone who has one of these pieces of junk who has trouble with the player.....I would like to obtain the subwoofer part. My email is [...]"
1,beware,"think carefully before you spend this much. Bought another model (cost $149). Broke in 1 week. Not under the warranty, and company does not repair their equipment."
5,Incredible debut....,"I went about this backwards. I came upon Steppin'Up first and back tracked to get this one. If I had heard this one first I would have anxiously awaited the second one. What impresses me the most is that he has cultivated a sound that is distinctly and most uniquely his very own. It is not heavy on vocals and that is certainly a most refreshing change of pace. Sometimes the instrumentation should just speak for itself and that is precisely what the artist has allowed to take place. Some of my favorites include, Hudson River Drive, Alicia Keys' Falling, Neighbors, On The Down Low, Dorothy and Going Home. The best was to describe the title song is I kept it on repeat for the better part of one day. This is a wonderful project and I hope that people will give it and a very bright and innovative artist a chance. You will not be disappointed."
2,Picture of book not correct edition,The picture posted of the book was of a much newer edition of the book. It misrepresented the listed item.
3,Hauntingly Disappointing,"As a storyteller with a passion for Hudson Valley folktales, I was disappointed by this book. Each story is a bare retelling of ""facts"" with no evocative language, no poetry, no soul (if I dare) and no historical background."
4,Scarry but enlightening,"Used this book for a project in a class. Living close to the Hudson Valley, it was interesting to learn about the history involving many places I have frequently seen on my travels"
5,I like this shirt,"To keep it simple, this muscle shirt looks great and fits well as it is long cut. It has serged seams around the arm holes and Tarheels UNC color raglan shoulders. Overall you would not be dissapointed. One note is if you do buy this shirt to get a size bigger than what you regularly wear as it does shrink and I happen like my clothes baggy."
4,mistleoe herbal caps.,"the product worked fine,i get cramps in my legs at night when sometimes when im sleeping andjoint pains sometimes when the weather changes.when i take the mistleoe caps, that doesnt happen.however amazons shipping cost are alot higher than most, i think i paid about 10 dollars for shipping, about the same as the price of the capsules and they sent it through the mail and it took a couple of weeks to arrive, for 10 dollars you think they could made it in a couple of days, but as far as the product goes im am very satisfied."
3,Good product for price,"The case itself is solid but tends to stretch over time and the plastic covering the keys now sags and is off center. Overall, a good product but for the stretching."
3,"Dirt cheap, flimsy but still usefull","I've had much better machetes. The blade on this one is paper thin and it bends easily if you try to use it on anything too thick. The plastic handle fell apart after a couple of days and is now held together with duct tape and the little cloth scabbard it comes with is difficult to work with. However, I HAVE gotten a lot of use out of this tool. Bent and battered as it is with a blade seriously in need of sharpening, it does a great job on LIGHT undergrowth and weed patches. Sure, I'd like a sturdier product -- and there are several of them out there for more money, but the $5.99 was well spent. I'm still using it."
2,Some times it works and some times it don't,"I usually don't write negative reviews, I think this could be a good cable, is just that this cable was just not doing good contact, maybe was factory damage and I got bad luck or is just that this is plain not good. I am just going to try something else maybe a little bit more expensive so I don't have to risk time again. Other reviews seems to be ok, so I guess it was bad luck, who knows."
2,1 Year great then failure,"Mine was great for the first year, but then it stopped switching between sources. BTW unplug the unit and plug it back in and it often switches sources (what a fun way to switch DVI sources!) I expected more from Gefen for the initial price of over $200 at the time."
5,Gefen DVI KVM Switch,Exactly as expected. Set up quickly and works great. Instructions clearly direct user to complete start up of one computer before switching to second computer. I had never thought of that before.
2,Weak Giallo (Minor Spoilers),"A weak ""giallo"" thriller (from the early 1970s) as a detective finds himself constantly one step behind a killer covering his/her tracks after a kidnapping gone wrong. There are a couple semi-gruesome murders here, but there isn't much true suspense since our hero never seems to be in any danger, and, though perhaps I missed something, it seemed the killer could have been anyone among the groups of suspects.I don't know the movie's history, but here it is presented in dubbed English. The anamorphic video is good considering the age of the title. Included on the disc are some trailers and interviews."
3,Pollock info,Don't know much about art - but Pollock was a friend of my mother's first cousin -- so was interested in this book.
4,Very funny - if you're not bothered!,"If you aren't a fan of the Snicket Series, you will probably find this book puzzling and bothersome. If you read the Series books, though, you'll probably find it hilarious! Some puzzles are easy, some are simply impossible, and most of them are meta-puzzles based on your understanding of the world in which the Baudelaires live. Definitely read the answers, even if you solved the puzzle. You will be surprised at the puzzles you missed along the way! If you loved the books, you need to get this one too!"
2,Why I cannot rate this product,"Puzzling Puzzles was to be a gift for my grandson, who adores all the Unfortunate Events books. Unfortunately, my copy, which was listed as in Very Good condition, arrived with many of the puzzles already solved, in ink. Other pages were torn. The book was never given to its intended reader, so I have no idea how he much he might have enjoyed. it. At least the problem was resolved, both by Amazon, which gave me a credit for the price when I complained and returned Puzzling Puzzles, and the vendor. Following my negative rating, the vendor resolved the issue by giving mt a $5 Amazon gift card."
2,It bothered me!,I bought it for my 8 yr old granddaughter and I could barely answer the puzzles and I was a MENSA. It will be a few years before Hannah gets it.
1,human league,I was dissappointed with this cd. The song human I thought was the 12 inch version. I was hopeing that it had the instrumental side as well as the singing version. I am still looking for that version.Thank you Linda Terry
1,Remix Reviewer #1,"Many music fans have been waiting for a Remix Album for The Human League for years. After being released I can say now that this album is disappointing. A vocal version for the songs ""Don't You Want Me"" and ""(Keep Feeling)Fascination could've been included. Although this versions are very good they're not the same with little or no vocals at all. Also, they could've include the 12"" version of ""Love Action."""
1,leather?,Within two seconds those shoes had creased in the front and bubbled. Real leather would never do this. I think there was cardboard under a thin layer of whatever the material is. It looked awful! Those were returned immediatly. I lost over $15 shipping them back and forth. Don't waste your time and money!
1,Not the same shoe anymore,"Got these and had the same issues as ithers with the toes. Tons of issues with stiffness in the toe on the right shoe. I gave it a week to break in, but now the sole started to separate on the right shoe and they're showing wear like they're months old.I have two other pairs of Cole Haans that have been great for nearly 2 years, but these are awful.It's a slick looking shoe, but no way I can recommend it to anyone. It's surprising these are viewed so positively on Zappos. It makes me wonder if different retailers get different stock."
2,Not as good as other cole Hahn shoes,"There was a definite difference in the quality of this shoe. The fit was different, and the leather was too. They were just not as comfortable as I expected, and one of the shoes slipped off the heal. I have several pairs of Cole Haan's, and they all fit perfectly from day one. Not these. The price is good, but not worth it."
1,A lousy book that doesn't mention the greats,Dreadful. It doesn't mention the greats like Abdel-Wahab and Farid. The author is extremely biased! How can he not mention a great composer and lute player as Farid?
5,Best introduction I've read,"Yearning to discuss technical specifications of the oud? Want to casually mention the influence of the maqam phenomenon at your next cocktail party?Me either. That's why I bought this book instead of some dry pedantic musicological tome. (Besides, I hate cocktail parties.)Arab music is fascinating to listen to, but it's great to be able to understand what's coming out of the speakers. Touma deftly handles major aspects of the music, and provides a layman's glossary and even a transliteration of the Arabic alphabet. Out of all the books I bought, this was the only one I could understand without a degree in musicology.A fabulous and down-to-earth introduction to what is often a mysterious subject."
3,I did not buy this,"Did not buy this, One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and one more time. Good or bad?"
1,Well constructed heater,I orderede the Natural Gas heater but was sent the propane gas heater of this version. It seemed well constructed. So I ordered the Natural gas version again - and I will return the propane version.
5,Must Have,"I bought this CD because I found it somewhere for cheap. It is easily one of the best culture CD's I have purchased! Lutan Fyah rides each riddim perfectly, and his delivery is right on point. Every single track on this album is GOOD! If I had to pick a favorite it would be between ""We Nuh Gangsta"" where he gives you straight attributes of rastafari. Or ""Mother Earth Healing"" tellin you about the Ital livity. To sum it up, Buy da cd rasta!!Give thanks for life, Keep the faith, Remember the SabbathProphet, Priest, & KingHoly Emmanuel I Selassie I Jah Rastafari!!Selah"
5,This is a classic.,"I had this CD before, i don't know what happened to it. This CD still hits hard i need to order this asap, did this come out before Bass 305 cause i know they produced it. DM Records The Best in Bass"
2,Not worth the money.,I am sorry to say that this book is boring looking. The photographs are vague. Sometimes you can see the grown up more than the baby being massaged. It is is from 1976 so it is way too old. Do not waster your money on this one.
3,Lacking but decent,It was a decent book overall. I found myself laughing at some of the scenes in the book because the cheese was just ooozing. Maybe that is because I like more complication and teasing in romantic situations. Some of the scenario's were just ridiculous to be frank. But that is only my opinion. I am betting the crowd of teens and early twenties would love it. It was a decent read. I personally like more complication with twists and turns but if you just want a straight up romance without having to mull over the plot to figure it out then this is the book for you. It is simply romance with an easy plot.
4,Claiming the Highlander,This book was a good book. It had a bit of action. But Maggie I didn't quite like for her bad decisions. What I like was the way Kinley spoke of Braden past. How they are interlink togeater with the other books.
4,I'm hooked,"Yes, I want to hear the story of all the MacAllister men and the women of character who are with them. Obviously I like romance novels but there is, to me, a fine line between the totally annoying I will be independent at any cost heroine and the simpering Miss heroine. Ms MacGregor has, in this book, walked the line very well. Maggie comes across as a likeable, charming person who can match wits with Braden quite well. Braden is the charming likeable rogue. The only reason I didn't give the book a 5 star was I had trouble with the end of the book when Braden decides to overcome his fear of commitment. I just wish it had been a bit more firey with Maggie. But that was slight and I've already got Sin's story on order....interesting men the MacAllisters and the women who claim them."
3,Okay but it lacks something.,"This story reminds me of the tale of ""Lysistrata"" but in a funnier more romantic way. :o) The characters are sweet but sometimes I found myself putting down the book. That usually doesn't happen to me when I read good romance novels. Nevertheless, it's a good story."
3,SO SO.....,"While I am a big fan of Kinley Macgregor and have LOVED all her other books, this one was not as good as her others....The plot was great, and I looked forward to the story as the Scottish Highlands are always a favorite of mine....but I was getting so tired of reading and reading constantly about how 'plain' Maggie was and how none of the other men in her clan ever gave her a second glance, and how beautiful Braden was and how women were ALWAYS throwing themselves at him! Enough!I hope she does another book on the other men in the story...Sin would be interesting considering his background and also Ewan....."
3,Could have been so much better...,"Although I enjoyed this book, I repeatedly thought while reading it that, if it had been about 100 pages longer, it could have been so much better. The premise of the book was original and fun. There was lots of humor throughout, which I liked. But the writing was almost too light, without the depth necessary to make a novel a real keeper. Normally plots move along too slowly and drag. This book moved along too quickly and essentially skimmed the surface. Even the love scenes were too short and matter-of-fact, not drawn out enough to make them really sizzle. But I liked this book enough to read the next one, and I just hope it has a little more depth."
4,"Good, but...",This is the first KMac book that I had to kind of skip through some of the wording. I thought there was a lot the same thing repeated over and over. I did find the book humorous but unfortunately I found several parts hard to believe also. Not to say this is isn't a good story it just isn't one of my favorites of her books.
2,jane austen meets david lynch...,"from what i've seen so far, about 20 minutes....think jane austen meets david lynch, or something equally as strange....not a fan."
3,pretty good,"this was the first t.v. version of northanger abbey i ever saw. i like the General as well as Isobella, and i think that Cathrine and Henry are kind of cute but, the bad 80's music and the fact sometimes Henry seems to be talking just to sound smart was rather irritating"
2,Not worth the time to watch,"Sorry, I know this was shot in 1986, but I don't remember the rest of the films shot that year being THIS technically terrible. The bad effects and film quality are so distracting, it actually makes the movie almost laughable. Not a good quality in any film, let alone a period piece.I'm not as familiar with this Jane Austen work as some of her others, but if her leading lady is as dreamy as portrayed here with so much internal fantasizing going on, you're going to need a special director to pull it off. I assume she was meant to be portrayed as highly creative, idealistic, unprepared for any sort of reality - instead she seems like a ridiculous, immature twit - or maybe that was the acting. I'd also be surprised if JA created her characters with so little depth or provided them with short, insipid text.Honestly, I'd try another version. I'm glad there are some because I'd written this one off. Not worth the money, or even the time, to watch."
4,See it more than once before you decide,"It's true that it isn't anything like what you usually seek when you get a Jane Austen film. So the first time I saw it I did find parts a bit tasteless and disturbing. But it's a movie I've watched many times. For greatest satisfaction I find it best to take it on its own terms. I think some probably give it a negative review simply because it is very, very different from what they expect. But after forgetting expectations and just watching it as any other film, you may feel very differently. Some key scenes (such as the confrontation between Henry Tilney and his father) would benefit from greater development. The end I find rushed. Overall a film I enjoy watching."
2,Good Book....not so good movie,"This movie was directed in a very weird fashion. The characters were awkward and the lines seemed cheesy. The weirdest part of all was the music, which was very much modern and not of the time period of the story. This pretty much ruins movies for me. I really enjoy this story though. But there is a newer 2007 version which I think does a much better job of telling the story and making you fall in love with the characters. Plus, the music is very fitting."
2,Duddsville,"I purchased this movie, unfortunately! I did not watch it all the way through, however! What I did see of the movie did not satisfy me. The music was highly irritating and the fantasy scenes in between the telling of the story needed to be obliterated! I was extemely bored by the whole affair to say the least! The acting was not wholly bad, but the movie should have been approached from a totally different angle and therein lies the disappointment. I strongly suggest that you waste neither your time or your money on this movie. I truly wish I had not."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I'm looking forward to Miramax's version of this novel from Jane Austen. This film version was a complete waste of time. After watching it, and I can't believe I sat through the whole thing, I wanted to get up remove the tape from the VCR, and crush the tape. Since the tape was a friend's, I could not. The film felt like a cheap meshing of ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Dynasty"", with flimsy associations with the novel ""Northanger Abbey"". Don't waste your time or money."
2,Anger over Abby,I was also unhappy with this version of Northanger Abbey and added to my disappointment was when I foundthat SIDE B was blank!
3,"An appealing, light fable","This is a pleasant, good-natured fable with a better ending than most fables have. Every now and then the camera gives you a lovely shot, but although it's a pretty film it's not breathtaking. Peter Firth is a charming Henry, with a sister so agreeable one wants to see more of her. Katherine Schlesinger is a very pretty, artless and sweet Catherine Morland. Robert Hardy, who is always memorable, clearly had fun being a rather contemptible villain. In Northanger Abbey, the main characters are warm and very human, while the story is smarter than they are and very sarcastic. In this rendition, the sweetness of the characters was conveyed far more successfully than the ironic wit of the original story. It's by no means a brilliant film, as it seems all films are unfairly expected to be, but it is pleasant, light entertainment, with moral lessons (about honesty and good judgement) that are not absolutely beaten to death."
1,The Worst Northanger Abbey,"I bought this movie years ago and was so excited to start a classic movie library. I am not usually a harsh critic, but this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. I threw it in the trash. Years later, before the Andrew Davies version came out, I had forgotten how bad it was and figured I had overreacted in my judgement. So, I bought it again.....and threw it in trash again. Thankfully, a new version came out with Felicity Jones as Catherine and JJ Feild as Henry Tilney. This version really accomplished what I wanted to see. Andrew Davies screenplay. Who could ask for more? I would suggest they never reissue this version again. I would then encourage anyone wanting to see this well-written, well acted and totally engrossing story to run out and buy the Andrew Davies version and enjoy!"
1,Very Disapointed,"When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time."
4,A wonderful adaption of the book,"Jane Austen was an amazing and very witty writer. However, her books were written for a different time period. I did read the book, Northanger Abbey, and although still delightful, it was rather slow. I felt the movie did an excellent job of condensing many scenes from the book into one or two scenes (mostly having to do with action ocurring at a ball)in the movie.If you love Jane Austen, period films, delicate love stories or glimpses of society in a very different time - I would recommend this movie. It is treat."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I first tried watching this movie before reading the book. I didn't like it at all and turned it off after half an hour. Several years later, when I read the book and enjoyed it immensely, I thought perhaps I hadn't understood the story well enough when I first watched the movie. So I tried watching it again, and this time I got almost all the way through. But it was ultimately a waste of time.I really like the book, but the movie is poorly made. The acting is bad (acting lessons are needed, plus the actors had no idea who or what their characters were supposed to be like), the picture is often out of focus or grainy (not just due to being VHS, but also due to poor cinematography), and the story has just been screwed up.The book was a satirical, albeit dark, comedy, and this movie had the flawed notion to try (unsuccessfully) to be a drama--it bordered more on the melodramatic. Skip the movie, read the book."
2,Very Disappointed,"I actually didn't like the movie at all. It is the only Jane Austen adaptation in which I found nothing appealing. I usually can find parts that are effective, however, this movie was disappointing in every way. (The last scene is somewhat redeeming.) I would definitely recommend watching this movie BEFORE purchasing it. I bought it without watching it and it will do nothing but collect dust. It is the only Austen movie that I will NEVER watch again."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of period films, and of Jane Austin, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It was disappointing. While the acting is very good, the production is very poor. What I objected to especially was the music, which was completely wrong for the period, and made me feel as though I was viewing a bad made-for-t.v. movie. This is no ""Pride and Prejudice""."
1,Don't waste your time,"What a dud. The acting is wooden, the soundtrack is inappropriate (saxophone in Victorian England?) and the macabre scenes look like something from a 1960's B-Horror film. I won't even waste more time writing about this flop."
2,Beware Jane Austen Purists!!,"I watched this movie because I am a Jane Austen fan, however I found that this version did not do the novel justice. The director took a great deal of ""artistic license"", of which none was for the best. I found the acting only mediocre and as I wrote before, the ""artistic license"" taken was for the deprivation of the movie. The scenery was, for the credit of the movie, beautiful. However, while reading the novel, I viewed both the characters and the surroundings in a much different light. Overall, I would not recommend this movie - I would however, with high regard recommend the book to you."
2,Mediocre,"This movie was slightly bearable to watch. I only recommend it for true Jane Austen fans. The problem is not with the plot, but with the horrid acting and directing. It was impossible to like or hate each character, as they all seemed hollow and confused. The dialogue was truly mediocre. The story line was without direction. I only bought it to complete my Jane Austen DVD collection. I was disappointed with this production."
1,Dreadful,"I am a big fan of Jane Austin, but this movie is absolutely ridiculous. The casting is bad, very difficult to believe that Henry Tilney is the ""most agreeable man"" when he's insulting and also played by a very unattractive actor. Costume design made the movie laughably absurd as the characters looked and acted like they came out of Alice and Wonderland. I agree with a previous review that said the ending is ""rushed"" and there are scenes mixed in that make you scratch your head in wondering ""what was the director thinking?""--Especially the scene where Catherine is lead out of the castle by a young boy (rescuing her from the bad singing no doubt) to have her watch him do cartwheels in the garden as she stares dreamily at him. Can't find enough adjectives to describe how bad this movie is!"
3,"Pleasant, but not Fabulous","This adaptation is in keeping with the book (not Jane Austen's greatest: she died before editing it and it got pulished posthumusly). Although you will not drool over Peter Firth like some are wont to do over another Firth (Colin of course!), you'll find the acting to be quite decent. My only real criticism goes to the appalling score: it seems to be competing for attention with the script instead of serving it!It's definitely worth watching, but you won't find yourself compelled to sit through numerous viewings, P&P; it's not!"
1,Northanger Abbey's folly,"Have tried to get through this movie twice, have not been successful. Very surreal & not very Austin."
4,Enjoyable Austen Fare,"First of all, I'm a guy, so I haven't read a single Austen book. But I did really like the Emma Thompson version of Sense and Sensibility, so I have purchased additional Austen videos so I can share them with my girlfriend. (Action movies aren't an option.)I did enjoy this movie quite a bit, even though the production values aren't as good as S&S; but they didn't have that kind of money to spend, and they didn't have Ang Lee to direct it.I really liked the female lead in the movie. She captured a young and innocent look better than most actresses I could imagine (Emma Thompson, for example, could have never done this role).I laughed out loud at Catherine's gothic fantasies. They seem to capture the mood of a young girl's longing for the prince on the white horse quite well."
1,Remove this tape from your list,The worst representation of a Jane Austen story I have had the displeasure of watching.Do not buy under any circumstances.
2,Could have been better,I have seen all of the Jane Austen films I could get my hands on. And this has been the most disappointing of them all. The music did not seem to match the story at all. And the quality had something to be desired. Although the story was very good. It just needs a bit of work to be up to the Jane Austen standards.
1,Northanger Abby,"Received DVD with second side unplayable, disk separation, very unhappy result. I now purchase my DVD's at another site, which was a ease and has great costumer support and much better prices. Amazon has become too bloated to check it's quality and have a responsive customer service. I love Jane Austen, have read and have all versions of videos of her work going back too BBC stuff from the seventies [my most favorite]. The newest version so to be released in 2008 Northanger Abby, sounds good. Amazon does not keep up with new releases or version of Austen, Dickens, Elliot, or James. Do yourself a favor though look to other DVD suppliers for your DVD's.John S."
2,Not up to Jane Austin Enthusiasts' Standards,"Very disappointed in this film. The movie spent too much time on the fanticy portions of the book than the reality. Got lost a few times. There was much more charater interaction in the book as well as other adapted films of Jane Austin's books than this movie. The acting was fair but as one charater in P & P said, ""Her teeeth are tolerable, but not out of the common wasy."" Next time I won't read the book first before I get the movie. Then I won't be disappointed. Not up to Jane Austin enthusiasts' standards."
1,Poor editing,I was very disapointed. This DVD is badly edited from TV to DVD. Most of the faces are cut off around the edges or at the neck.
2,weird and eery,"I must confess that I haven't yet read the book, however, I will now. The background music was, I found, very dominating, and I thought out of sync, but the atmosphere prompted me to read the book. The darkness and mordidness some of the imagined scenes did make me laugh. They make me wonder whether Catherine, a girl of that time, would really have had such vivid and wild fantasies. Overall, it was good, but I would like to have been able to make a comparison with another production, if only to see how someone else would have portrayed some parts."
2,"Read the book instead,please!!","You have no idea how the book is better(ok,probably you have)comparing to this film!the actors are fine,Katharine Schlesinger plays Catherine Morland well,but i found the script to be very strange(those flashback scenes,that was unnecessary)and a bit confusing(if you haven't read the novel you'll be confuse about their feelings)and they made modifications from the book.So read the book first!"
1,Northanger Abbey,"This adaptation was the worst I have ever seen. Even if it were not an adaptation it would still be lousy. There was no continuaty, the dialogue forced, and the acting was horrible. If no one was familiar with the story they would be completely lost and confused. It was pure choas."
1,Awful,This is one of the weakest Austen novels transformed into an equally weak movie. A real space waster in the DVD set.
1,Northanger Abbey,"Just an awful movie~ Save your money and buy Sense and Sensibility, or Posession. This was truly one of the worse films I've ever purchased and I'm even madder that I paid for this one~ It really is just ""AWFUL""~"
2,The Heroine's Wide Eyed Stares Get Very Annoying!,"I was disappointed with the movie Nothanger Abbey. While I think that Peter Firth is a good actor he unfortunately got stuck acting in a bad movie. My complaints with the movie are the stupid dream scenes, the freaky looking lady with the weird makeup that made her look like a corpse and the weird crescent moon designs on her face and I was also disappointed with the actress who played Catherine. She had the same look on her face to show every kind of emotion. All she did was make these annoing loooks like making her eyes get all big and her mouth drop open into an O shape. Like she had a perpetulal look of wide eyed stares and of looking constantly shocked, startled and surprised. I realize the wide eyed stares were suspoed to show that she was young and innocent but it was annoying and got old fast!"
2,A very creepy version,"I am a hard core Jane Austen fan, and love this book. This version of the movie is not good. It is very creepy, and not at all funny as the book is. The actors and sets leave a lot to be desired. It also skips over some key portions of the plot, apparently to make room for some of the dream sequences. The ending makes no sense at all.Save yourself some time and money and check out the more recent version."
2,Masterpiece Theatre's version is much better.,"Masterpiece Theatre's version of Northanger Abbey is *much* better than this version. This version is choppy, and it is too obvious that it is a product of the 80's. (Not that there is anything wrong with movies from the 80's, but I think its signature (the 80's feel) on a film from a different time period is disturbing.) The Masterpiece Theatre version delivers the plot more smoothly and, in my opinion, is of better quality all the way around (including the choice of actors). I highly recommend passing up this version in favor of Masterpiece Theatre's."
4,Karen Avid TV view,"I really like this version of Northanger Abbey. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that music they chose for background. This music did not belong. The story took place just before the 1800's began. This music is for a story set in modern times, why I said it took place just before the 1800's is that Henry told Catherine that the marquess husband was guiltioned last year. I totally believed Katherine Schlesinger as Catherine. Peter Firth was a perfect Henry. Also Robert Hardy as the father, not at all like the kindly vet he played in All Creatures Great and Small. He also played another Austen character in Emma Thompsons Sense and Sensibility as Lord Middleton a complete opposite to this one, proving himself to be quite a good actor. Of course it is not in the same league as the 1995 Pride and Prejudice, which is the best adaption of them all, but still I recomend this, just ingnore the modern background music and just enjoy it. I of course did."
1,Very Disappointing,I bought this movie because Northanger Abbey is my favorite Austin book. I was leery of purchasing because so much of the book happens in the mind of the main character. I was afraid the plot and character development would not translate well to movie format. It didn't. If you have not read the book then the movie would be very confusing with little or no character motivation. I gave my copy to the thrift shop.
3,Northanger Abbey,"Think the book is better thanthe movie. I have heard there isa better production and am anxious to compare. This copy wasalright, just not my favorite."
3,"A good movie, but nothing like the book","I thought that northanger abbey was actually a very good movie, but, while it had some scenes where it was like the book, it was overdramatised and things were added in until it became more gothic fantasy than jane austen originally put it. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I enjoyed it very much, but when I read the book, it was plainly different. So here's what I reccommend. This is a five star moive if only it isn't supposed to closely resemble the original book. The two are very good by themselves, but not together. :)"
5,Faithful to spirit of the book,"Faithful to the spirit of the book. Thankfully (and unlike some other, respected adaptations of Jane Austen's books), the script retains the humor in Austen's prose. The casting is great, the acting is excellent, with Katharine Schlesinger an absolute stand-out... as Mr. Tilney observed, every thought and feeling shows on her face."
2,Disappointing! Not one of Peter Firth's Best Movies!,"I have seen most of the BBC productions of Jane Austen's novels and I liked all of the ones I have seen except Northanger Abbey. Peter Firth is a great actor but even he couldn't save this dud and he seemed uncomfortable and confused as though even he himself was confused by the disjointed, choppy filming and knew that it was going to turn out to be a lousy movie! The actress who played Catherine was very cute but didn't really have a great range and showed the same expressions on her face to show every type of emotion. She would constantly make her eyes get all big and her mouth drop open into an o shape. Very irritating."
2,CHEESY!,"I guess the adaptations of Jane Austen's other novels spoiled me. Cheesy is the word I would use to describe this movie. I really didn't like anything about it. I think the director wanted to make a gothic movie rather than a romance. Plus, there were so many things in the movie that did not happen in the book. These things make the movie terrible. I would love for the BBC to make a film that was true to Austen's wonderful novels. Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, etc, were incredible adaptations. Many people seeing the movies read the books as a result. The opposite happens when people view the movie Northanger Abbey."
4,Jane Austen always a good story,We had not seen this movie but liked her other books that had been made into movies so bought this one also. Enjoyed it very much!
1,What a bummer!,"i give this film 1 star, because no star was not an option. it was boring, disjointed and senseless. in sum, totally disappointing. a major directing and editing disaster.i find it hard to believe it was a bbc production, which are usualy top notch. with that, and the fact that i'm a jane austin groupie, i bought the film without checking the ratings. i actually watched it twice,because i was sure i had missed something. there was nothing to miss.northanger abbey is the only austin book i haven't read yet, but i am looking forward to reading it in order to find out how far off the film missed its mark. i'm sorry i can't return it--the used copies don't seem to be selling very well."
2,A dark depressing story,"As a major fan of Jane Austen I am seriously dissapointed by this movie. It looks like it was filmed in the dark, with dark and heavy music as it's backdrop. Not only that but there didn't seem to be any happiness at the ending. It was a brooding not very well acted movie. I was sorry I spent money on it."
3,Hardly acceptable as good film making.,"How could someone have all the right equipment to make a movie and fail to deliver? Wrong combinations of costume, sound and film kept this from being a success. The castle would have been interesting to see if the filming had picked up the details of the furniture and the outdoor scenes. The Roman bath was an unusual attraction for the film but you could not see it very clear. The hot springs were a good site also but the color was so drab that the lake was unattractive instead of beautiful to look at.Low budgets must have put the filming at risk and they had to offset it all with bad sound, improper costume coordination (or lack of)and direction of the film in general.If these problems had been addressed the movie would have easily gotten five stars from me.However, it was like ""Gone With The Wind"" compared to ""Persuasion"" by BBC.Five stars for ALL of the performers, though."
2,Wow- What a disappointment!,"I received this video as a Christmas gift and was excited to see the one Jane Austen adaptation I had yet to see. It was poorly acted and surprising ill cast for a BBC production. I could not believe that the characters fell in love, because the dialogue was very stiff, and the acting even stiffer. Please read the book instead of taking this poor shortcut of a movie."
5,"A great read - A ""cannot put it down"" book","For a relatively new comer to the publishing world, this author has written two very good books. This being her second, is actually better than the last. Although a romantic comedy, there is suspense in this book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are also a few unexpected surprises too. The story is full, the characters are great-one feels they really get a handle on them and gets to know them. The actual story line is interesting and captivating- this is definitely not ""fluff"". The storty is also relavent in today's world with internet and corporate security very much a reality in our lives."
5,Big Trouble is big fun,"Computer security consultant Naomi Connor is making sure Brennan Shipping's computer system is un-hackable. Unbeknownst to Joe Casey, Naomi hacked into the company's computer system when she was only twelve, nearly bringing the company down. Now she plans to redeem herself, but her plans don't include falling in love with Joe. And Joe's don't include dating a work associate or any kind of long-term relationship. If they do give in to the attraction between them...if he does find out about what she did all those years ago...they could be in BIG TROUBLE.BIG TROUBLE has a great plot, great romance, great hero/heroine. I learned a few things I didn't know, which is always a bonus. Although it has laugh out loud lines, there is also a serious underpinning. In the story beginning, Naomi says she's looking for redemption, but what they're both looking for is acceptance. And, of course, a lot of sex. This book has both. After reading it, I want to read Jameson's first book, MY HERO."
3,Big Trouble,"Twenty years ago, a twelve year old hacker named ""R@ptorgirl"" wrecked havoc on Joe Casey's family company. When the company needs a security audit now, Joe has no idea that their former nemesis is now to be their best friend, or that he's going to fall hard for Naomi Connor, who has now grown up and reformed. Her skills as a hacker make her ideal for the job, but she keeps her secret hidden. Even as the pull between her and Joe grows, her once upon a time crime overshadows Naomi. She knows Joe and his family would hate her, with good reason, if they found out the truth.*** Though there is a lot of padding in this story, at its heart, its a good romance of redemption and second chances. It is a very credible tale, one you can imagine really happening. ***"
2,Don't waste your money,The premise of this story is that 20 years ago a 12 year old girl hacked the Casey family company. The author continually stresses the fact that Naomi is blonde and 36DD. But she's smart too. Which after the first chapter becomes annoying. His mother is this angel on high who is just so calm and forgiving til it is no longer belivable. This book was supposed to be a romance with a computer mystery thrown in..Not. It has no romance and the main character figures out the hacker as soon as she does first inspection. Nothing more is done with the subject until the end when it hits her by magic. There is no romance light or other wise in this book. This is a book that I recommend you either do not read it or if you feel you must please get it used or from the library.
3,Basic,Not a heavy-duty trowel. The point of it bent badly when I used it in our clay soil to transplant rosebushes.
1,LED light does not travel faster,"All light when traveling through the same medium travels at the same speed -- the speed of light. Period. The product description is misleading when they claim that LED light travels faster than other lights. LED lights may have enhanced intensity, making them brighter. Check yo facts bruddah."
3,"If your heart if for shepherding, you will enjoy.","If your heart if for shepherding, you will enjoy this book.It compares the natural to the figurative shepherd.Phillip Keller has the true heart of a loving shepherd.Some really good gems in here on how a shepherd should intimately know his sheep.No correctional points at all. ( which I would have actually looked forward to).A good book written by a kind hearted man, to have in the shepherds library :)"
3,Ginderic at best,"If you like metal legends like Iron Maiden's ""polished"" metal sound and riffs and/or anything about Atreyu, you'll feel right at home with this one. The Melodies are excelent and they play with a very tight sound, but the [...]sobb singing trend has to die soon or I'm going to kill myself.I got this CD for from a buy one get one half off Amazon.com deal, and it's not a horrible CD, but it has the same sound all these post ""nu-metal"" bands have. Extremely cool riffs, lack of creative writting, growling one moment sining like a panzey the next gineric sound. Get over the fact your girlfriend doesn't love you anymore and move on with your music."
3,Interrupted Compilation,"This is a good CD for people wanted a taste of what Roach has to offer. But those who know and are seeking the deepening experience the ambient sounds have to offer may wish to buy something other than a compilation. The tracks are from different releases which at times for me personally, would feel like an interruption in the mood of the previous track."
1,BAD!!!!,"IF YOU LIKE NOISE AND SOUND EFFECTS WITH VERY LITTLE MUSIC, THENYOU MIGHT LIKE THIS. I HAVE SEVERAL CDS ON SPACE, BUT THIS ONEIS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HEARD. IT IS MAINLY NOISE.MR. ROACH NEEDS TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC OF DAVID ARKENSTONE, JOHNSERRIE, AND MEDWYN GOODALL. HE NEEDS TO STUDY THEIR MASTERFULWAY OF EXPRESSING THIS TYPE OF MUSIC.THIS IS A COLLECTION OF SEVERAL OF HIS WORKS, AND BY LISTENING TOTHIS CD I AM SURE I WILL NEVER BUY ANY OF THE OTHERS. I AM GOINGTO SEE IF I CAN TRADE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE."
5,Just Brilliant,"This album is superb and I can heartily recommend it to anyone who likes 'Structures From Silence' also by Steve Roach. This album has more to grab onto, so to speak, and I listen to it often. This music really transports you in a very comforting and weightless kind of way, and is not badly served by the percussion elements on several of the tracks. There is an other-dimensional quality too that I have found rather captivating. So if you like 'new age' that combines space music with earthy/tribal rhythms, then this is for you."
5,masterful,"If you enjoyed the masterful magnificent void, by Roach, you will love this. Roach is quitepossibly, along with Stearns, the greatest composer of ambient and or space musicthe U.S. has produced. If you love deep space, buy this."
3,absolute beginners workout,level absolute beginnersstyle Cuban-Uk colombian mixIt's great to see an English latin style Salsa & Merengue dvd being sold on Amazon.comThis is more a workout warm up type of video. If you are just starting to learn salsa I think it will be great.If you want to practise begginers warm up steps this is the dvd.I teach all the same moves to beginners.This video is the only video I have seen that uses plain looking beginners in the background. If you want to see what a beginners salsa class is like then this dvd is great.Watching the beginners get the steps wrong was refreshing. Even Olga is not that good a dancer or teacher but she knows the steps.Very good value & a refreshing change from the other instructional dvd's on the market. I enjoyed watching this dvd. I would of liked the social dancing at the end to have been longer.But at least someone is thinking outside the square & giving us something different.
4,Entertaining and easy,"A very good beginner's dvd...Olga's spirit is refreshing, especially the dance she had with the three guys in the bonus part after the ""salsa turns"".I recommend this video."
2,Disappointing,"This book's description sparked my interest and led me to think that it would fill a gap in Eliot scholarship. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book does not quite achieve what it sets out to do."
3,hopalong cassidy,i enjoyed the first movie but the second had all kinds of problems with the sound quality. it would go silent every few seconds and the sound would return for a few seconds and repeated this through the movie. the picture quality was good but the sound problems made it a very unenjoyable experience.
3,Much smaller than expected,"I ignored the other reviews about size when I purchased this -- I should have listened. The quality is good, I like how it folds into an easily carried tote. I'm thinking of buying a second one and sewing them together to get the size I need for a 4 person family...but that would probably negate the tote functionality. If this is for one person to sun bathe or for one sleeping bag, its fine; but if you want to fit more adults comfortably, either buy 2 or go with something else entirely.I did A LOT of searching to find something bigger, but couldn't find something of like quality with a competitive price."
4,Great blanket for a picnic!,Just went on my first picnic with my fiance at Central Park on memorial day and this blanket did the trick. I love the fold up feature. Very comfy to lay on. Great price for the quality.
4,Great product for outdoor events!,"We have used this blanket all summer and fall for outdoor events. it is especially useful when there is dew or mud on the ground. I had some reservation given the reviews regarding the difficulty of rerolling. Honestly, I have not had a minute's problem getting this rerolled. You just need to pay attention to where the velcro tab is and ensure that is the last part you roll up.If the ground is wet under the blanket, it can get a bit slick. We've always been sitting on the blanket, so we haven't had a problem with slipping, but if you were to step on it, be careful.I have washed it a few times as directed and it still looks like new."
2,Not washable! Has holes in it after washing,"I like how the blanket folds up, and has a carrying handle. Amazon says that this blanket can be washed and dried. The tag says to spot clean it only. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known this. After washing the blanket developed holes in it. Very disappointed."
4,Love it!,This is perfect for the on the go parent. Nice compact fold and plently of play room. Love it!
1,Freaking Creepy!,This CD freaked me out. I think I will have nightmares instead of dreaming. I literally had my hair stand up when about 2 minutes into the CD it sounded like a dead soul shrieking. CREEPY!This should be a soundtrack for a horror movie not to sleep to.
2,Boring,"I think I was fooled when I bought this dvd. Only half the designers are know. Once it gets to the end of the dvd, it's not even couture designs. It doesn't show any of the designers or behind the scenes. And it doesn't show the entire runway show of each designer. I've seen better!"
2,Odd combination of some usefulness and some waste of time,"Positives:The letters are shown fairly clearly. When signs are repeated, they are fairly clear. The beginning tracks have some useful words and phrases.Negatives:The pretend conversations are too forced, and often waste too much time that could be spent teaching signing. The skit/lecture about encountering a deaf person in a shop was a waste of time. Some of the signs are not repeated. There are several words that are not anywhere as useful to know as some others (e.g., I'd much rather learn about stuff to eat than the signs for some of the major religious groups)."
2,Unclear and Hard to learn by,"I found this vidio hard to learn by. But unfortunitly I have to put up with it because it is the only VHS Sign Language vidio I have.PROS: -gives a wide selection of signs-One can learn ASL by seeing somebody DOINGit.CONS: - unclear signs- introduction is too long...it dosn't get to the :) point- it has an unneaded example of a hearing person :) meeting a deaf person- Scenes do not run very smoothly....they are randomTo some up....NOT A GOOD BUY. If you happen to haveat your Library, borrow it there.....DON'T BUY IT!!NOTE: Try their other vidio:Sign Language Fun for Everyone: How to Talk to a Person Who Can't HearIt's reviews are much better, people rate it 5 stars. I havn't bought it, but it appears better put together."
4,Good for the learner who does not have much exposure,"You can only take so much text, flash cards, and study ... then you need to see it in action. part of the learning process is not just learning the signs, but being able to read them when someone else uses them. Looking for perfect? Language is not perfect. This is a great primer as it also gets you exposed to someone who has had to learn speach without the aid of hearing. this is a great DVD,"
1,Language,"This was hard to follow. Sometimes, the camera shot did not even show the person's hands so the viewer can't even see the signs being made. This is not for beginners. It did address ""deaf prejudice"" but didn't help me learn the language."
5,a wordsmith,"some of the most poet but melodic country music I have ever heard,not the most uplifting but incredibly beautiful music.check it out"
3,K&N 60-1470 High Performance Custom Assembly,"Price was good, but it didn't fit like I had hoped. The filter is actually a round one forced into the triangle shape."
3,Only picks up Spanish radio!,"I have been to several job sites with Bosch radios, and all the only thing playing was Spanish radio! I've seen plenty of reviews complaining about reception, but the Spanish stations seem to come in fine."
1,A $200 GFIC,"The WORST jobsite radio. The FM reception is a joke, you move away from the radio and it goes out. The CD player is hit or miss. Basically this is good for the GFIC, but even that is a pain with the doors covering the plugs. Don't buy this!!"
3,"Sound is good, radio reception OK, remote rarely works","While the volume level is pretty punk the sound is good. I had to turn both treble and bass up all the way to get a decent volume level. I think they may have done this so people will not blow the speakers, maybe, just a guess.The reception is OK but not what I would expect for something that costs this much. I think how robust a cars radio tuner is and wonder why this radio tuner can't be as good. Often I have to move the unit around to get good sound for different stations.The remote control is a joke. When using the remote directly in front of it and within ten feet it will not work 80% of the time. It is unbelievably frustrating. If this feature is important to you and a deal breaker do not buy it."
3,Proven bad reception (FIXED!),"New-----I Read the reveiw about the new antenna and ordered the unit. It's well worth the price. And now reception is as good as any other radio out there. It's playing CD's and MP-3's as I type. and I get all the stations I need on the radio. Kudo's to Bosch for the quick fix. I wish I could increase the actual rating, 5 Stars, no question.--------I saw the radio in the store and had it in my cart. I thought I should read the reviews prior to purchase and put it back. After reading the reviews I went back to home depot and with the Dewalt on one side and the Milwaukee on the other I performed the reception test. Don't buy the Bosch. I'm a great fan of their tools but the Bosch would not pick up ANY FM stations while the others would tune clearly to 8-10 local and not so local stations.The Good- The MP3 function puts 11 hours of music on a disk, and with 12vdc and 4 outlets of GFCI It's still a good tool. I may need to take it apart to put an external antenna on it tho'"
3,Poor sound,"I was glad to finally get ahold of a work site radio that is sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of... well.. a work site.This one does it. However, the quality of the sound emanating from those small speakers keeps this piece of equipment from being a good buy. I would gladly pay a little more for better sound."
4,Happy with the purchase,"Very happy with the purchase, seller, radio, cd player, remote, and splitter ( four outlets! ). If you use Bosch battery powered tools( I do not ) , your stoked. The weather radio feature that comes with other radios( milwalkee) would be nice, but you cant have it all, at least not all the time. You can use the battery compartment, which is generous, for pencils, the remote, cell phone, etc..Take luck, Godbless, Andrew"
1,Not worth the box it came in,"This thing is worthless!!! It's not loud at all. The CD player barely plays CD's. At first we thought it was computer burned CD's (which played on our other players), then it would play store bought CD's a for a few seconds & then quit playing IF they read at all. The reception is BAD. We barely get any stations.Like the title says, this thing isn't even worth the box it came in!!!"
1,Don't make the mistake of buying this,"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. Unfortunately, after minimum use and no abuse the stereo stopped working. I went online and saw that other people had this same issue. The unit gets power, but the stereo doesn't work. After contacting Bosch three times, someone finally called me back and told me that other people had this problem and the company won't do anything to fix it. He did not recommend any measures of repair for me, he just told me that they won't do anything. The Powerbox certainly did not live up to the hype and the customer service was terrible.I will not make the mistake of buying anymore Bosch tools."
1,Died after about 20 hours,I purchased this radio NEW not reconditioned to use in my garage. I took it to two outdoor parties at my brother's house. It died after a few hours in 100 degree weather. It sounded good while it lasted but at the price I would not buy another. Definitely not industrial strength or as tough as it looks. Maybe I could have mine reconditioned
2,Not fit for the purpose intended,"After all the bells and Whistles, and the smoke clears. I quickly realized that this unit is not even fit for the purpose intended.I'm convinced that this radio is the poorest sounding radio on the planet earth. Right after I write this review, I intend on calling, ""Ripley's Believe it of Not"", and the Guiness Book of World Records. I',m sure this story will interest them both.Just imagine, this unit is refered to as the, 'Advanced Power Job Site Radio"". I would have been better off just purchasing an Ipod."
2,"Loved it, until quit working","I absolutely loved this radio, until it just quit working. Dead. Nothing. Now, I don't have a battery charger. I checked for a fuse, nothing. It is dead.I own a lot of tools, and BOSCH has continually disappointed. Unfortunately, I've purchased a lot of BOSCH tools. BOSCH tools should be considered 'cheaper' quality in my opinion.I hope you don't make the same mistake I've made and purchase tools mfg by BOSCH. They are too expensive for their service life."
1,don't buy this radio,not only does it not get reception but it doesn't even power up in cold weather! no matter what they say about new and improved i don't care don't waste your good money on this radio its crap.
3,Serves Purpose - Useless Remote,"We wanted a stereo out by the pool that we could plug things into - so we are NOT using it as a ""work site"" item - however - it does do the job, and the extra plugs work great.The remote (as mentioned in several other reviews) is useless. We cannot get more than 5 feet away and have it work - and I have changed the batteries.Also - the cigarette lighter plug that is on it - I am not sure what that is for, but it came with the fuse blown. We found the right fuse, replaced it - and tried to plug in a car-refrigerator. That blew the fuse as well. So - I guess it would be like for a cell phone charger or something - not enough juice going to it for much else.Overall - I would probably go with something cheaper and not necessarily water resistant next time - if it had a workable remote. The whole point was to leave the remote by the pool and have the extra plugs. If it goes out or quits working... I will probably get a power strip and a real remote-controlled radio."
5,What a great find!,We are so happy with our new Bosch job radio. The sound is perfect and the extra plug came in handy at our new home. We just can't believe this is a refurbished radio - you would never know it. This is the third time we have purchased something refurbished and we will do it again and again.
4,time to get real here.......................,First of all any btty that last's 8hrs on a charge is great. Reception is not the best but for a jobsite radio its fine. To compare it to Milwaukee is not fair as thiers isnt even a charger. Sound is by far the best of all three.
1,power what??,"I purchased this radio from home depot the other day and I have to say I was very disappointed.first off the radio is a tank and seemed to take up valuble space,which wouldn't have been a bad thing if it had been worth it.Second the sterio was not immpressive sounding at all ,weak volumn, terrible bass reponse , and bad reception.All that for just under $180.00 I'm very pleased with my bosch tools, this being the exception! milwaukee sounds 10 times better at under half the price!"
1,MP3 Problems,"I bought the power box because of the mp3 capability but every cd with mp3s that I put in skipped songs, or would not recognize songs on the cd. I would use new cds and that did not help either. The sound is very highs oriented with no bass at all. The GFI is a nice feature but what I really want is a work radio that functions as a radio and can last a little. When out of the box there are malfunctions with the MP3 capability there is a problem. So I turn on the radio to find that there is no reception. Very bad very bad!!!!"
2,POWER BOX? Not really.,"I got my Bosch Power Box the other day after ordering from amazon.com. I had read the reviews about the radio reception being poor & I figured they were exaggerating, but it's terrible! I can only get 2 FM stations in clearly & everything else is either all static or not much more than that! Its CD player works well & the sound quality is ok but not great. You have to have the power box plugged in even to charge your cell phone. Bought a bosch 24v platinum battery for it ( over $130.00! ) & it only works for about 8 hours before going stone dead. Lastly, the darn thing is heavier than a box of tools! With all that weight behind it & a price tag way bigger than Milwaulkee & Dewalt ( actually, you can buy both of them for the price of the Bosch!!!) you'd think they could make a better performing unit! Why did I keep it? It's the only one with a CD player...THAT'S IT!!!! Don't buy it unless you want a jobsite radio witha built in CD player!!!"
1,The proverbial fly in the ointment,"Its just sad..........guess I'm to blame for not researching reviews BEFORE I purchased one of these online as an early christmas present for myself.I'm in construction and spend long hours on the job. Some days the radio is the only thing that maintains my sanity, distracts me just enough to not mind being there so long.Don't get me wrong......I like the features.......was a hands down decision based on that. But now I have a radio that WILL NOT receive my favorite radio stations. Hardly receives any at all!!Not sure what I'm going to do with it........but right now Bosch gets a big thumbs down IMO."
4,Bosch Garage Boom Box,"Checked around and compared like items . Needed a radio/CD player for garage that got better reception than the little alram clock I'd been using for years. I trusted the quality of Bosch and took a chance thru Amazon because of the low price. Box arrived in good shape and upon opening found all to be in good condition. Took it to garage and cranked her up thru various AM & FM stations. I was amazed at the strength of signal and crisp sound I evoked from the built in ""equalizer"" which is really a series of slight changes in sound... Rock, Stadium, Concert Hall, etc. Over all I'm pleased with my choice. Would buy it again."
5,great radio,the mp3 function and play back is great the sound is loud but it work the best with the EQ on your own custom setting it has great sound and yes it durable and the 4-way GFCI protected outlet is drop I use it in side and out because i got the Ipod dock and it is well built and it is not very expensive depending on where you buy it. It is just what I need to go with my Ipod.
3,Buyer beware - very heavy,"Nowhere in the review does it mention that this item DOES NOT COME WITH A BATTERY. A 12 volt battery is $30 and an 18 volt battery is almost $50. I would not have purchased this item if I had known that. Also, it mentions a connection for an mp3 player but requires an adapter that did not come with mine and is not identified in the directions so another expense. It is very heavy and will be more so with the missing battery.3/25/2011 Update:This unit is very heavy with the battery in it. But it works wonderfully with my XM receiver. I did not have to buy yet another boombox that would accept my XM connection and now my wildlife rehabilitation clinic has XM radio which I really appreciate."
1,Doesn't work in cold weather,"I purchased this unit at HD and quickly found that it wouldn't power up, sometimes. The screen lights up but displays nothing and nothing works. I figured out that it was the cold temps. It wouldn't even start in my garage which is super insulated and always above 40 degrees. I took it back and exchanged it. Last night I left it in my truck with a low temp of 22. The new one wouldn't power up either. Crap,crap,crap. I live in Montana and the box is sold in Montana. Lets be realistic. Jobsites are cold. By the way, when I exchanged my old one there was another box sitting there that had also been exchanged. Is there a pattern here? See the other review on this same issue."
2,POWER BOX with CD Player,"I purchased the Power Box Advanced at the end of December 05. When the unit arrived I unpacked it in my house and tried it for a week. It would not play a CD without stopping, even a new unwrapped CD. I contacted Bosch and received a replacement unit. The replacement unit played CD's every day for 2 weeks then repeated the problems of the first unit. I purchased the unit for the CD function, but have been unable to get a unit that will play CD's without failing. The unit keeps spinning the CD, but will not play sound. Both units will not recognize a CD in the drive after this failure. I will try one more time to get a unit that plays CD's."
2,Honestly Disapointed,"Bought it at the L.A. JLC Trade Show last year.1. First thing my crew noted was no radio reception and I mean NO reception. Note: They have a fix kit to upgrade this.2. Sound quality is lacking in Bass, very mid to high end sound, but tolerable.3. The CD/MP3 player plays when it wants, stops when it wants, and starts again when it wants. Sometimes it will not even recognize that you put a CD in it. Very frustrating for the guys.4. You either have to put it on a bench or tilt it up so you can read the display which has turned black in direct sunlight.5. It is built tough though. It has survived a year with a bunch of framers.6. I will take it back to the trade show this year and expect a replacement.-Michael WatsonFraming Foreman"
1,"poor sound, poor charger, poor CD player","This player skips more easily than any other player I own--if you have scratches on your CDs, prepare to be very annoyed. The sound quality is poor and it doesn't go loud enough to be heard over most power tools. The charger is a slow charger, not as good as a standard Bosch quick charger. By default it enters ""bosch sound"" mode, which you have to turn off to get the sound to be halfway decent, every time you turn the unit on. When you insert a CD into the unit, you have to wait like 10 seconds before you can hit ""play"" while it reads this disk. There is no way to control the treble/bass except for a few equalization modes, none of which sound that good. This is all around a poor product."
2,Good..... when it works,"First of all I do like this radio, when it works. I live and work in North Carolina, not the coldest place earth but apparently cold enough to cause my radio to never work when i leave it at the jobsite in my trailer. Even when its a little cold ie 45 degrees my radio will not turn on until it sits in the sun for half an hour and warms up. When i contacted the company they told me this was a common problem and there was nothing they could do for me. Wow thanks for selling me a jobsite radio that doesnt work on a jobsite. If you want a radio for a heated shop its nice, but if you work outside or any area that isn't heated DO NOT BUY THIS RADIO!"
1,I Am Not Happy,"I finally got the Bosch CD player and I am going to send it back. For the money, I expected it to sound good. It sounds terrible.My plan is just buy an MP3 Player and store music on it and play it through the Milwaukee. The Milwaukee sounds amazing. This Bosch is a huge disappointment."
5,"Great, easy to use camera!!!!!!!!","I purchased this camera for my mother a year ago. I think I have used it more than her! I have finally decided to purchase one for myself. It is so easy to use. The lenses change easily. The auto focus makes it almost impossible to take a ""bad"" picture."
1,What you learn from this book is not worth the money,"This book is way overpriced for the information that it delivers. Besides being out-of-date, it focuses on what might be called discovery outsourcing with minimal information about preclinical development outsourcing. The author has littl to add, though he does explain preclinical research and the factors involved in its success rather lucidly. It's certainly not use the price they want for it. Find it used for less than $50 and it will be a reasonable purchase."
5,Awesome Music,"Whoever it was that said this music has no bass must be deaf or have really bad speakers. If you happen to have 2 15"" in woofers in your trunk then this will pound like nothing you've ever heard before. I would really recomend you have an 18"" woofer to get the full feel of the music. So much low bass. If you love bass and you don't own at least one cd of TBC then your really missing out."
5,BASS Lovely BASS,"This CD is great for tuning car audio systems, only if they are built to handle the ultra-low frequency sounds!!"
5,Classic Price,"Great movies of Vincent Price doing Edgar Allan Poe stories. Five films on two DVDs, in two different cases. The DVDs come in a cool box as seen in the picture, great purchase."
5,Fabulous actor,Any movie that Vincent Price is in is never a disappointment.I hope that you enjoy his movies as much as I always have and thanks to the world of DVD's I also will.
3,good except for a hic-up in one of the films,"The quality of the films were quite good. But about halfway through ""Pit..."" the images stopped and leapt a bit then, after that the sound/dialogue syncing was out of whack. No mark on the DVD itself so assume it was an encoding error. Review would have been higher if not for that, as it's a good accumulation of his films.--DJS"
4,Vincent Price movie pack.,I received the DVDs in about a week. Did not work on my DVD player but did work on my disc player on my computer. Glad I bought it!
3,Okay for a text,"This book is okay for a text book, however there arent many examples, and the examples that are there are very simple. There are solutions for some problems online, though most of them are very basic and don't help very much."
4,For MatLAB begginers,A book for who are learning or beggning to use the MatLab. Comes with some examples and exercises on algebra and more. Must to have a hard cover!
2,Not Good,"Item was delivered in poor condition. Textbook spine was broken and pages falling out. Very disappointed as this product was advertised as in ""good condition"" and wasn't a cheap purchase."
3,Not Quite Right,"Seller and Shipping were terrific. Author's content in book was mostly subjective, and poses some interesting points, however nowhere does it ""prove"" any of his theories regarding Jesus or Mary, or who exactly was at the crucifixion. It does contain some excellent history of the middle east during christs life. Worth reading as an alternative point of view."
2,My First Wedding,I found myself waiting for the end. The characters weren't very enduring and the plot was pretty boring.
1,Perfect together,"Watching the movie, I was struck by the lack of emotion the Rachel Leigh Cook had at cheating on her fiance, the day before their wedding, with a man she thought was a priest.Then I realized, ""The 'priest' has been lying to her from the beginning. And has no remorse about it and only is concerned with breaking up her possible marriage, even trying to pimp out his so-called best female friend to seduce the fiance (which doesn't work).""So it became obvious to me: the two lead characters are PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER. They're both liars without any regret over who they hurt in their pursuit of ""love"".This movie isn't particularly funny or even amusing. The plot and characters are completely unbelievable.But the love story between two people lacking common sense or a moral compass? Is perfect in every way.One star for the beautiful city the movie was filmed in and the physical attractiveness of the cast."
1,not a very smart comedy,"The premises is fairly weak to start with, you should be thinking alone the line - yeah right, that's going to happen, the product description pretty much sum up the whole movie. However, hopeful, you want to get some good laughs from the various tricks the guy used to get the girl within the 96 min runtime. Unfortunately, those schemes are not very funny, nor smart, fairly off the wall. Not much chance for acting from Rachael Leigh Cook, and Kenny Doughty, very plain silly expressions throughout, just shots after shots of young and pretty smiles. The supporting actors/actresses didn't add much either.Note that the DVD has no subtitle also, sometimes can be hard to make out what male lead said with his British accent."
3,"Good book, but outdated by the author himself","It's important for all to note that this is a *reprint* of an older book. It contains some outdated information, including some that was corrected in Sponenberg's later book. Although this one is less expensive, I suggest buying Equine Color Genetics instead."
1,There are better books out there on horse color.,"This is a reprint of an old book. It contains outdated information and some incorrect information. The names used for color identification are combinations of England terms, Spanish and old west, they don't fit any one region nor are they accurate. If you truly want a treasure-trove of information, that demystifies the interrelationships of color, identifies different colors, explains the occurrence of rare colors, and discusses the responsibilities of breeders. One that features explanatory diagrams, a detailed summary of information in the appendix, and nearly 200 full-color photographs that accurately depict the different breeds and coat colors, a resource breeders will find themselves referring to again and again. Pick up Horse Color Explained by Jeanette Gower, you will be glad you did."
3,horse color review,"i was hopeing this book would have at least a section on what color would get if you bred this color horse to this color horse, but it didnt i would have liked to see color images with each color they were talking about , they did have a section just full of diffrent colors but i think they should have put color pictures with colors etc they were talking about other then that it was ok.it came in good condition the price was great."
4,I now own both publications of this book,"and I have to admit that I rather like it. It is very different from the second book, 'Equine Color Genetics', which makes me wonder why this second edition of the first book should have been published after the first edition of the second book. Confused? So am I!"
1,Not worth it ...,"There are approximately ten 30-second ""mini-lessons"" on this $20 DVD. No matter what the content is ... it's still only 5 minutes worth. Plus, the mini-lessons of are the most basic nature: ""make sure you have enough speed in powder ..."". Duh? This DVD is a rip-off. The NASTC should be ashamed of themselves. I've never returned anything back to Amazon, I will try with this item."
5,Best Lopper Ever,"Twenty years ago I purchased my first anvil lopper with the Scott label (possibly made by Wolf Garten.) After years of pruning with that terrific lopper, I was looking for another great lopper and I found the Wolf Garten Anvil Lopper. Wow, it is the bomb of all loppers!I just cut through a 3 inch diameter rhodie branch with not too much effort. It easily cuts just about every kind of wood that I have tried.What a wonderful addition to my tool collection. I also got the anvil pruners which are fabulous and the grass shears aren't so bad either as far as grass shears go. I do like the swivel blade design for easy maneuverability cutting different angles to the left or right."
5,"Very good design, built to last","I bought this lopper to replace another anvil lopper. The previous lopper worked very well, but failed after 3 years because the anvil was not sturdy and eventually broke. (Anvil loppers work by trapping the tree branch etc. between a single cutting blade and a flat anvil). The anvil on the Wolf-Garten lopper is extremely sturdy and should last forever.Pro: great design, very sturdy, cuts well, aluminum handles, should last 10-20 years."
1,Very Dangerous Toy,"PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOY. My 4 year old, who is in love with Ninja Turtles, was given this toy by me, his mother, for his 4th b-day in March. In May, he fell on the top of the toy and SEVERED his pinky. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED, and I hope that it never happens to another child, or to another family. It is a VERY heavyt plastic toy, with very sharp edges on the top and bottom where it opens. By the way, Amazon should change the rating system and include a ZERO STAR! This toy doesn't deserve the 1 star!!!!"
5,be careful please!!!!,ok first of all PLEASE be careful this toy can turn into a dangerous weapon unless you just crash it softly or just smash it into the walls calmly. ok?!?!
5,This is THE book to read for beginning biology.,"I love this book! It is just the opposite of what most biology books are. It is enjoyable! Throughout the book, I was learning, looking at the beautiful pictures, and laughing. I have yet to see a better, more entertaining non-fiction book. Thank you, Robert A. Wallace, my life has been greatly enriched by the reading of this book."
2,Not What It Seems,"We purchased this as a gift for family. When the trowel arrived my wife (who is an avid gardener and very discerning when it comes to her equipment) immediately freaked out that it ""looked cheap"", ""wasn't at all ergonomic"", and certainly not worth the money we paid for it.Deciding that it wasn't worth it in shipping, time, and effort to return it, I believe we ended up just keeping it."
5,Does what it says!,"Very functional! I ordered two, one for phones, the other for PDAs and MP3s. And the price is right!"
5,Wonderful book full of great old gospel songs,"This has been such a great book for me. I love the old gospel songs I grew up with, and I was afraid I'd never be able find the music for some of them. This book has many of those old songs I love...even a few I'd forgotten about."
3,Good Deal Money-Wise,These are my favorite choice of candy when programming or composing until the crack of dawn. One annoying realization was the some of the wrappers were damaged or lose. I've already thrown away at least 10.
3,Poor wrapper,"I love blow pops. They taste great and last a long time. They have a big problem. It's very difficult to remove the wrapper. What happens is the wrapper sticks to the stick and you can't pull it off. They must use super glue. You might think it's a safety feature, but you can take the wrapper off the portion that covers the edible part fairly easily. You're forced to eat the lollipop with a plastic wrapper in your mouth. What I do is if the wrapper doesn't come off, I throw it out and try another. So instead of 100 lollipops per box, I get maybe 80 or so I can actually eat."
1,Too bad.,"Can't recommend this one. I bought one on a lark, not expecting anything but a conversation piece. It lasted about 4 hours before dying. It heated up to the point the case melted in one spot. The plastic stress relief on the USB plug end also discolored, apparently from heat on that end as well. Oh, well. Cute idea. Poor implementation or quality control."
4,Item as descriped and come in nice box,Item as descriped and come in nice box ..I recommend you to buy it if it's only in sale...it's worse 15$ that I paid for and more than this will not be considered agood deal.
1,Grill was warped beyond use.,The grill arrived so warped that it cannot be used as intended. Don't know if it was warped during shipment or before shipment. I think it was warped during the casting of the unit. It's not worth the price paid due to the problem.
3,Have a Question,I haven't purchased this item yet. I need to know if the grill can be used on electric and gas stove tops?
5,A magnificent farewell,"The previous review suggests that American readers may not be aware of Martyn's death. He died in Edinburgh on 30 January, three weeks before his 34th birthday, following a long battle with the cancer Hodgkin's Lymphoma. My following brief tribute is reproduced from Amazon.co.uk.Knowing the background to this album - that here was a very gifted musician who knew that he was dying (tragically young), and who wished to put together one final creation which would sum up his life, a statement of who he was, where he came from, and what he stood for and believed in - I found listening to it a very moving experience. Lie easy, Martyn - you've succeeded magnificently."
1,People with stories should not always write them,"I think Kathleen's story might have been better if she had chosen a ""ghost"" writer instead. Did we really need every detail of every moment just so Kathleen could fill enough pages to call her story a book. I don't recommend this book to anyone. I couldn't even get past the poor grammar, and writing style in the first 20 pages. I had to skip through the book to get to the ""good parts"", ha what good parts."
2,Give me a break!,"Yes, I am a skeptic and this book did not help to change my views. I cannot possibly believe this is a true story. It just sounds like an exaggeration of what the author wished could have happened. I was truly dissappointed in this book. I probably would have enjoyed it if it was labeled as Fiction. Don't bother!"
2,Spirits or Ghosts?,"One of our club members selected DON""T CALL THEM GHOSTS; because she has lived in the location of this setting and knew the address. Most of the others were reluctant but we will discover what she had to share as we discuss it this month. She will lead us and it should be interesting. The writer was convincing and sharing the reactions of her own children at the end of the book added to its pleasure."
3,a little too slow,"This book started out with a bang...literally! I thought great, a fast moving book that's gets right to the point. However after that the plot slowed down immensely. I found myself getting impatient. This is the authors first book and some allowances must be made but I feel it could have been edited better. There are pages of the author discribing her thoughts which seemed to run in circles. It got to the point I began to look at the ending, which I never do, to see how much more I had to go. Also it was a bit too religious for my tastes. Nothing wrong with that but I wish I would have known that from the start. I did find the ending to be very moving and was glad for some resolution to the story. All in all, it's a good first book but not something I would recommend to friends without a few disclaimers."
5,Great Book!!,I really enjoyed this book. It is a great account of living in a haunted house and all that goes with it. Finally a book that does not make ghosts scary. It even made me cry!
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,this is a great book! i am a true beliver of the paranormal and i have had several encounters. when i first bought this book i read it every chance i got.kathleen showed us the more nicer side of the spirit world. this book was indeed heartwarming and i rarely cry when i read a book but this book was different. towards the end of the book i started bawling! it was sooo sad..you can picture everything that is said...i highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested...
2,"Interesting, though non-spectacular","Horribly written. I skimmed over most of the unnecessary details, which the book was full of--such as the detailed search for information in the library. Still, overall, it's an interesting, though non-spectacular, ghost story. If you like real ghost stories, you'll probably enjoy it."
2,The religious rhetoric is tedious,The story was interesting but I found the author's constant dialog about her zealous Christian beliefs and interpretations of the haunting good reason to put the book down.
2,Don't do it,"This is definitely a beautiful bed spread, but I really woudln't recommend it. It is LOUD. I don't know what kind of fabric it is made out of, but it makes an unpleasant noise everytime you move (which just isn't fun when you're trying to sleep). Not to mention that it really just doesn't feel nice against the skin. My cat won't even sleep on my bed anymore because of this bedspread. It's definitely not worth it. Save your money."
2,watch review,My first time purchasing jewelry on line and very disappointed. I purchased two Seiko watches and one was defective the Womens SWZ054 Dress Two-Tone Watch. It would not close. I brought it to my jeweler and he said the clasp was defective. I really like the style and weight of the watch and disappointed in the quality of the closer.
4,Seiko Woman's Two tone watch,"The watch, in and of itself, is a nicely designed piece which lends itself to being worn with just about any outfit. Yes, it does resemble a Rolex to some degree in appearance, but can stand on its own for great looks. Would have given it a full five star rating except for the difficulty in adjusting the bracelet. Also,the first watch arrived with a dead battery - which was annoying on Christmas Day - but was replaced quickly by Amazon."
5,Seiko Women's Dress Two-Tone Watch SWZ054,"Oh yes! I LOVE my watch. It goes with everything I own! From my business suits to my casual jeans and t-shirts, it is a watch I can use daily as well going out to dinner. Perfect size face and it is so light-weight! It is eye-catching and has a classic look. THis is one watch that will last you for years."
2,not what I expected,"It was nice, but it was supposed to be luminary and it isn't/ I have a hare time seeing and I need my watch to light up."
5,for the wife,"Bought this for the wife for Christmas present. She loves it and gives her the features that she needs. From reading the reviews I see that the price has gone up quite a bit, but appears to fluctuate with the season's. Should have waited until after Christmas for a substantial price difference, not sure because of Seiko or Amazon. Will monitor over time, as see that Walmart offers items cheaper than Sam's club at times. But as it is, wife is happy with it."
5,Seiko WOW,I received this watch and was immediately impressed with the quality of the workmanship and design. It is way nicer than the photograph shown on Amazon.com. The price is excellent. I wear it everyday and receive numerous compliments on it.I have always loved Seiko and this new watch has not let me down.Thank You for carrying them.Diane
5,"Good quality, a lot cheaper than in stores",It is a good watch and at a price lower than I can find it at any retailer in my hometown.
3,watch band,"The watch is beautiful, however, the band is not practical...The catch isn't sturdy enough to stay closed...Always checking to make sure it is on my wrist...Is there one that can be replaced...a stretch band that matches the watch??Lorna C Laney"
3,Seiko Women's SWZ054 Dress Two-Tone Watch,"I love Seiko and have a high regard for the workmanship of their watches. In fact I won't buy anything other than Seiko. I was in the market for a replacement after my previous one of 15 years died. Anyway I purchased this one after reading the great reviews. However it was defected, the date and time would not advance properly and SAT was mispelled. I did however request a replacement and hope I will be satisfied with this one. If that's the case I will certainly change my rating to 5 stars. Thank you."
3,Watch,"It is not the quality of my last watch, exactly the same one. The clasp is very difficult to secure.I do like the look and Seiko is a good product."
2,Was this product a 2nd?,"The pin for the watch bracelet was too small and the clasp was very loose. I had to take it to a jeweler and have them fix it. I have stood by Seiko watches for over 25 years and was very unhappy with the condition it was sold in. I kept it and paid to repair because I know the price was good. But, I guess that is the price i have to pay for getting something I wanted which was affordable."
2,Disappointed,"This watch is bigger than I would have liked - but I knew the size from the Amazon site - so I can't complain about that. The clasp is hard to attach. When I had the jeweler remove links, she asked where I got the watch because she thought the clasp seemed faulty. I was looking forward to the day and date feature - but I can't seem to get that right - perhaps I haven't read the instructions well enough. And the days are in English and French - weird. I also really wanted a stretch band - but couldn't find one on the Amazoon site. So I'm not thrilled with this purchase."
4,I love my Seiko,This is a great watch. I like that you can wear both silver and gold with it. I like the fact that it's water proof but I still take it off to go in the shower or in the pool. It often gets mistaken for a Rolex!
2,"Known Brand, Not Quality","I have had Seiko watches, but I was disappointed with this one. The band does not match the quality of the watch itself. I thought the watch was defective so I took it to my jeweler's. He said that the fold over clasp appeared defective. The bend of the clasp extension did not fit the size of the band. Where the clasp attaches to the band appeared to be defective, the angle was bent more than the jeweler thought it should have been. The watch just did not feel comfortable. In addition, the band has quite rough edges. I would think the watch could easily get snagged on clothing. I was disappointed with the quality of the watch. I am surprised, because I have always thought Seiko to be a quality brand. After seeing the quality of this watch, I don't think I will be purchasing another Seiko. I will try the Pulsar at less than half the price and see how that quality compares. Pulsar Women's Dress Two-Tone Stainless Steel Watch #PXU028,"
4,Just what I was looking for.,"Was very glad to get this watch. It's attractive and isn't ""too busy"" with all sorts of useless functions. I love the day of the week and date feature. The minute hand is a plus, too. My only fault with it, is that it's a bit hard to snap the bands clasp in place. Finally, I figured out that I just had to make sure I took more time aligning the two snap over metal ends, and all is well. Highly recommend this watch as a step above sport watches, but not over laden with a lot of features one might never use.The stainless steel body will assure that it stays attractive, too. I saved even more money than current price of $138.00, here on Amazon."
2,Bad wrist clasp,Problem was that the latch would not click shut when it was on my wife's arm. After sizing the problem remained. Off the arm it was very difficult to make the latch click shut. Further we did not know this was a latch watch band. It may have said something in the description but that should have been said right up front. Beautiful watch - too bad it didn't work.Jim
3,Disappionted,"i was disappionted in the small size of the watch, and I paid 135.00 for it,and it looks like its worth about 75.00 ,it has a gun metal look to the braclet, no shine,very flimsy braclet,and its sooo small. I like at least a 30mm case, this is about a 22mm. I wish I would have purchased the mens version,and for the men,do not buy this version because the mens version is also small at 35mm, to small for a mans watch,especially these days where everyone is wearing oversized watches. If you are a woman that likes a slightly larger watch ,then get the mens in this style,all in all I would not buy if given the chance to do it over again"
1,Poor quality,I installed the oil cooling lines on my 1994 Chevy pickup using the Dorman Products # 625-107 and 625-108 cooling lines in February of 2007. They are both leaking again. I thought I would have better luck using an aftermarket product vs. a Genuine GM part (which I used the first time they leaked). I am disappointed in the short lifetime of the Dorman parts. We'll see how good their limited lifetime warranty is when I submit a claim.
2,Biography --NOT a How-To Book,"If you are interested in reading the life story of Andrea Grossman and history of her company, this book will hold your attention. If you want to see photos of all her friends, family, vacations, etc., by all means, buy this book. If you are looking for ideas for using Mrs. Grossman's stickers in your albums or are looking for scrapbook page layout ideas don't waste your time or money. I was very disappointed in this book as I was looking for creative ideas. I have gotten more ideas from a Mrs. Grossman magazine ad then this whole book."
3,Definitely Mrs. Grossman,"This is a mini-bio of Mrs. Grossman and her success in the sticker business; it also showcases some of her own scrapbooks. True to this ""Designer Scrapbook"" series (I own 2 others - K&Co.; & Susan Rios), these books are really infomercials on the various companies and their founders, NOT scrapbooking ""HOW TO"" books.Having said that, of the three ""Designer"" books I own, Mrs. Grossman's is the truest to a scrapbooking tradition - showcasing her photos, memorabilia, and journaling, and using her products to enhance - not overwhelm - the pages. I guess you could say her style is ""simple scrapbooking,"" but this style is very useful in getting the memories recorded in albums.There are enough ""artsy"" scrapbooking how-to books in publication to fill several bookcases, but this book is useful in that it shows the basics -- and a simple, non-intimidating style anyone interested in preserving life's memories can implement. For that, I must applaud Mrs. Grossman's effort."
4,Very good Fantasy,I have owned a copy of this book ever since I was 11. (I'm now 13.)This is a great book for everyone who have a keen interest in the middle ages as well as the fantasy & legend of the Werewolf.
1,This is not jungle,"This is the absolute worst ""compilation"" I've ever bought. At the time I didn't know many jungle producers' names, so when I saw the mix names I figured it gave some credibility. <sigh>When I got to the car I realized it's actually a bass CD. One of those ones you used to hear the guys at the stereo competitions. None of it is actually music, it's just a bunch of big bass notes with extraneous samples and ""jungle rhythms"" thrown on top. It's fine if you're looking for one of those bass CDs, and if I had bought this a couple years before that I would have been happy with it. But don't buy it thinking it's real jungle.As soon as I sampled it I literally threw it out the window. If someone woke up one morning with this on their front porch, I'm sorry."
3,"Not the best, but somewhat useful.","This book was used in an Environmental Justice-centered course I took, and frankly, I found it lacking in scope. Perhaps it would have been more useful for a course with a sociology focus."
5,A brilliant combination of form and function,"This remarkable book involves an interaction of comments by major contemporary thinkers and thoughts and questions from the author. There is an ever widening and deepening exploration of many subjects; the nature of work, the transformative power of language, the structure of oppressive societies and numerous other concerns. As varied as the subject matter is, it is linked in a way that is fluid and in depth. Reading it is a deeply reflective experience, and yet as hypnotic as an intellectual ""call and response"". This is one of the most beautifully designed books I've ever seen. The graphics are simply,coolly abstract and the paper is rich and earthy in color and just a pleasure to touch."
5,Great Music!,"Halo's career climaxed with this CD and it's prececessor, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band"". Listening to their music from the early demos all the way to ""NITMFOI"" you'll be startled by the progression from surreal garage rock to the polished, biting, hillarious material in these last two albums. ""NITMFOI"" is an excellent CD and one of the discs I own that I listen to often. Buy this disc and encourage them to make more!"
3,so so sd card,"I had no problems taking pictures and storing them in my sd card. But I had a very hard time uploading pictures from my SD card to the computer. It was the most difficult task just trying to use the SD slot built in my laptop to transfer pictures from my 4gb card to the computer. I spent a lot of time, hours to say the least, just to try to transfer pictures from the card, which I never had a problem with any other sd cards before. The only way I was finally able to transfer pictures was through a usb cable from my camera. Yet I have not been able to figure out how to transfer my video from my camera to the computer. No mater how many times I have tried attempting the transfer, the video will never upload to my computer. I need a computer whiz to help me out on this one!"
1,Misleading - This card is SDHC,"I ordered this product specifically because it is non-SDHC for my Wii. Tiger Direct sent a SDHC version.I called customer service and, since I was persistent in complaining about having to pay for return shipping and the proximity of Christmas, the rep. claimed he would refund my credit card.I guess you could call getting a free card a plus, but I think everyone should be warned you won't get what you want. The rep said they have no regular, old SD cards anymore."
1,Not for a Kindle,"This item did not work in my Kindle Generation One. Customer Service at Kindle couldn't get it to work, also."
3,Great service,"Great service but all 3 of the cards I ordered were defective. Got an immediate answer, and prompt service - NO QUESTIONS ASKED. Will use them again in the future."
1,was sent wrong card,"Tiger Direct sent a sdhc card instead of sd card Card was of no use to me! They took their sweet time answering my email, so I gave it to someone and bought a card elsewhere"
3,Not bad,"The first JLP album I got(and still his best) was the individual choice. That has the famous 'computer incantation' and soloing by Holdsworth, one of my favorite guitarist. This album(Fables) sounds quite similar but lacks many things IC has. Anyway, I prefer these electronic stuffs to his early fusion efforts(except another great album, enigmatic ocean with Holdsworth and other strong rhythm section members). I'd say this is a good album but if you are interested in his music in this period, get Individual choice. IC is much better than fables. But still it is very listenable. BTW, I got 'Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy' by Return to forever with Fables. What a difference! It is damn hard music for me. But Ponty? Easy?"
1,Bottom of the barrel?,"In which Jean-Luc Ponty completely runs out of ideas. This is perhaps the worst of JLP's 80s efforts, comparable to Individual Choice for vapid inanity. It's hard to believe this is the same recording artist who put together the sublime Imaginary Voyage, Enigmatic Oceans, and Aurora. Ugh. A real stinker, from start to finish."
1,Not so sharp,"I have had this grater about two months and have not used it that much. Only to zest lemons, limes, and to mince garlic and ginger. When I first got it, it was as sharp as a razor and worked beautifully. After minimal use, it is so dull that it will not zest a lime. I would not be afraid to run it over my face. If you are considering buying a grater/zester, I suggest you try another brand, I know I will."
1,Washed-out reproductions,"Never trust an Amazon reviewer. The reproductions are washed-out, bland, they have no intensity.Too bad the alternative is $250.Buy it if you like blandness."
4,Great book for moder art students and personal enjoyment,It was nice to see the transition that Rothko made throughout the years from complex modern art (ala Picasso and Dali) to more simplistic yet rich in colors.
2,Disappointed by the quality of the reproducions.,"A thick, beautiful looking coffee table book, but if you seek an approximation of Rothko's work, you won't find it here. Rothko's work was full of vibrancy and beauty, but this book offers flat, lifeless reproductions. The blacks are not black and shadow details do not exist. The colors are often so far from the originals that you must use the artist's titles for clues as to what the actual colors were."
4,"Good book, great artist",I first saw Mark Rothko's work as a student working on my bachelors degree in fine art and he changed my life and changed how I look at art. Everyone who wants to learn how to be a fine artist has to look at his painting's to appreciate what modern art is all about. Of course you have to see the painting's in person and most big cities have a museum where you can see Rothko's but this book is an exellent place to start to learn about him and to learn how to look at art. Some people complain about the color not being perfect but for the price what can you expect. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about modern art.
2,This is more of a giant program listing than a book,"If you are some kind of gear-head that loves to read through program listings, this is the book for you, bubba! It is about 90% code and 10% commentary on the code. Dorfman even chooses classes that only a true gearhead could love, like 'key', 'mouse', 'event', 'window' etc. rather than abstracting real business-world items such as 'customer', 'account', 'order', etc. As if that's not exciting enough, the platform of choice for this text is DOS (yawn)."
4,Very Surprised,"I got to say that I was pretty skeptical when I purchased this. I work for a court reporting company that widely uses WordPerfect 5.1. Anyone will tell you that WordPerfect 5.1 was the best, but its beginning to get really hard to run it just right in the latest operating systems. What caught my attention about WordPerfect 11 was the Classic 5.1 Environment. With everyone working at my company on 5.1 It may be the way to go to get everyone up-to-date. Corel should have done this along time ago! My first few minutes playing around with it and reading the manual to get it into classic mode it was nice. The product seems to be pretty solid, unlike past WordPerfect Windows releases. I didn't do anything real in-depth: did some typing, printing and opening up some older documents save some new ones and see how they were cross compatible. Everything has worked great for me so far. This may be just what my company needs."
3,Not as good as expected,"I have been a long-time fan of Word Perfect - since Version 4.0 days. But so far I have been disappointed with 11.0. I do not see much change from 11.0, the upload time is slow and it continuously freezes my computer (using Windows Me). In addition, I understood the upgrade was to include Paradox (database) but apparently it does not."
2,The WP11 Previewer Crashes The Program,"WP 11's previewer crashes the program every time you try to preview a document created with WP10 or earlier, or if you try to preview an MS Word document.WP 12 is excellent. WP 10 is stable also. WP 11 should never have been shipped with its defective previewer. I was forced to reinstall WP 10 for day-to-day use. I used WP 11 strictly to create PDFs.WP 12 has excellent stability and better functionality than WP11.WP 11 is a defective program. I should be given a refund for the money I spent to buy WP11.Skip 11 and go right to 12. The WP12 demo is available now, and WP 12 ships later in the month.(I've been using WP since 5.0 in 1989)"
5,GOOD FATHER/DAUGHTER MOVIE!,WATCH IT WTH YOUR DAUGHTER'S DADDIES! THIS WILL INSPIRE YOUR DAUGHTER TO BE WHAT SHE WANTS TO BE! STUFF YOU JUST WON'T GET FROM DISNEY!
3,"Large coverage, Too general","This is my first photography book about colour. It covers a good large range of topics about colours. From introduction of individual colour, colour temperature, colour properties to colour relationship and colour editing.However, after years of reading photography magazine and websites, I don't find these information useful or new.In addition, there are only TWO small pages (the book is not even in A4 size) for each topic, there is no way to go into any details at all.I don't think it is worth buying this book or recommend this book to any one unless he/she is totally new to photography basic knowledge."
5,Top Text,"An excellent book. Well written and easy to understand. If you have not previously been instructed in the science of color you will be well served by this text. The photo examples make the book! Very, very, well illustrated. Too the point.After reading this book I can say, ""I DO understand digital color.""Thats what I paid for."
4,Excellent Interpretation,"This book is one of the best shakespeare books that i have seen. It offers clear interpretations of language that is uncommon in our time, often giving several differing interpretations which are still being debated by language experts. It is simple enough for a first time shakespeare reader, yet still retains all of the content. However, constantly looking at the footnotes, some of which can take up a fourth of a page, grows tiresome, which is why the book only gets 4 stars."
3,I was there!,"I was AT this show when Arthur & co. performed -- on that friday night, the night after Thanksgiving 1991. ""At My Place"" was the place [in Santa Monica]. ANYTHING we can ever get by Arthur is great, considering how rare he ever made public appearances back then & especially even further back.I AM however bummed that ""Five String Serenade"" didn't end up on this CD as IT was the FIRST song they played that night.I can't figure WHO decided to use an old [but cool!] photo of The Whiskey on the cover when none of this music was recorded there[??]All in all, an in-between / cool release."
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT !!!,"GREAT BAND !ARTHUR LEE'S VOICE WAS STILL "" CRYSTALLINE !""WONDERFUL SONGS...ABYSSMAL , FRUSTRATING SOUND QUALITY !!!"
1,This Book Stinks,"The guitar portion of this 'book' is a pitiful joke. The chords portrayed are NOTHING like the actual chord voicings. For example, the intro chords in ""Peg"" are Ab7 to G7 to Gb7 to F7... Unreal. Maybe I'll use it as toitet paper when I run out..."
1,Might be a good Piano Book...but,"Hi I bought this book hoping for some information and/or facts on the band steely dan, instead what i got was a music book for piano players...a huge disappointment...but if i played piano, it might be different"
3,"OK, but simplified","So I got the Steely Dan songbook from MCA, but a lot of the chords seem to be ""rounded off"", and some of the songs are in the wrong key! Maybe my Mobile Fidelity CD copy of Aja runs a bit slow, but I transcribed ""Aja"" (the song) in B, and this book has it in C. Ditto with ""Peg"", Db instead of C. Bummer. Also, this book shows the first chord of ""Aja"" in the right hand as E-G-B with C in the bass. I figured out the first chord as F#-A#-C#-D# with B in the bass. After that, it's not even close. There are a bunch of things like that. The intro of ""Sign in Stranger"" doesn't resolve up like the book says, it stays on the C and there is a trill they missed. I was hoping this book would be a step above the average piano book, like the transcriptions in Keyboard or Guitar Player, but it's not. Oh well, at least it's fun to jam to the changes. -jl"
3,Poor quality but interesting early work,This CD is clearly a copy from a Vinyl original and you can actually hear the pops & Clicks. It does however provide an interesting insight into Sandy's work early in her career. For completists only.
1,Broke first time I used it,"I bought one of these yesterday at a local store. I ran it through my hair about 7 times and the hinge popped apart, then completely broke in two. I don't know if this is an isolated incident or not. The iron was doing a great job on straightening my hair, which surprised me because my hair is very thick and coarse. I may take it back and try another one."
1,NOTHING MAGIC ABOUT THIS PERFORMANCE!!,THIS IS A JOKE!PRODUCTION IS POOR! WITH ALL THE SONGS THEY HAVE THEY ONLY GIVE US 8 SONGS. 4 ARE DONE TWO TIMES. TWO ARE NOT EVEN BLUE MAGIC SONGS! WHAT A BIG WASTED OF MONEY! IF YOU BUY THIS DVD DON'T SAY I DID'NT TELL YOU SO!
4,The Psychologist/Monk is at it again!,"Dr. Seif in his third of the series is solving a mystery again. Along the way he teachs about Buddhism, natural healing, forensic psychology and spirituality. Not bad for a Catholic monk who has a deep knowledge and appreciation for world religions and the many paths to healthing and health. This book would make a fun adjunct to a class on world religions."
2,Bowfishing Point,"These are by bar not the best tips for bowfishing. They fail to open all the way if they open at all, and that was even right out of the package before they ever hit the water so there was no rust or water involved in the malfunction. Keep shopping."
2,Not so good,"After they've been wet a couple of times they start to fail, they don't open and close properly. I would only recomend these to someone who is just getting started in the bow fishing hobby. If you're serious about it don't use these, spend the extra money and buy good blades."
3,"Fun, but a little too flimsy...","My daughter did enjoy playing with this baby gym, while it lasted. She loved to watch the bird in the center flying back and forth, and she liked the cheery music and lights. But, like some of the other reviews I read, the piece of plastic in the center that connects the two poles broke. We had only been using this gym for about 6 weeks when this happened. My daughter was still at the age to use a baby gym, so we had to go buy a different one for her. I did not feel comfortable tying the poles together with string or anything else that is not intended for use with this item, and it was definitely not fixable. This is a very cute baby gym, but it really needs improvement. We were pretty disappointed. If this item had not broken, we would have been very happy with it."
5,Worth the money!,"When I went shopping for baby gyms I was suprised to see how much more expensive they are now compared to when I had my first child, 4 and a half years ago. I decided on this one for my 7 week old. She loves it!I was so suprised to see the bird flying back and forth . It reminded me of being on a ride at disneyland . I knew it played music but I didnt pay much more attention to the other features it had.The gym keeps her attention for quite a while. She sat under there for about 30 min kicking her feet up at the toys. Every time the bird would start chirping she would start ""cooing"".Ive seen some other gyms my friends have for there babies. They are alot more expensive and arent as nice as this one. Im so happy we decided on this one for her!"
4,Keeps your little one occupied,"I purchased the Flutterbye Dreams musical gym for my daughter. This was the only place, other than Mommy's arms, where she was content. The beautiful colors and soothing music kept her occupied when I couldn't give her 100% of my attention. The only downside to this product is that as she got bigger,(mind you, my daughter is 11 months old and weighs 14 lbs), she would pull the bird off and this would frustrate her because she could not put it back on. So, all in all a beautiful product, I just wish it was a little more difficult for the baby to pull off the birdie."
4,Nice playmat,This playmat was awesome for my daugter up until she could turn over. Once she was able to do that she always hit her head on the birdy. ( the swaying birdy would accually hit her). if there were a way to unatach the birdy and the stem it comes off of it would be great. the toys that hang from the bars can keep my daughter buys for hours. the toys that come with it do come off and you can add your babys favorite toys from there. so much fun...
3,Ok for first few months.,"My daughter loved this in the beginning. The bird moving & chirping constantly entertained her. 1 month after I got it, the bird stopped moving, only heard music & chirping. Now that she can roll over & crawl she seems disinterested in it. Was worth maybe 3 months of entertainment."
5,Greatest gym ever!,We have been using this gym for 2 weeks now and we love it! My daughter is just amazed by the fluttering bird. The lights and music are a great stimulant.
4,New Mommy,"My 2 month old absolutely loves this play gym! Originally I had registered for the Musical Play Garden. Although cute to look at, it wasnt't as stimulating for my daughter as this gym. Being a rather active and alert baby, she loves to stare at the cute blue birdy, and kick her legs and bat at all the cute accessorizing toys. The music and lights really drive her to remain active in the gym. Besides its adorable appearance I love the fact that it is washable. My only concern is the velcro tabs at the bottom of the mat that don't seem to be strong enough to anchor the arches to the base. However, so far it hasn't been a problem. Overall it's a great item."
4,"Awesome for entertaining, only one problem","My 5 month old loves this gym! Only one problem--- he has such a strong grip that two weeks ago, he placed 1 hand over the birdies head and another hand over the tale. He pulled on it. After 2 or 3 times of doing this, the birdie died. Music still plays but the motor that makes the birdie go back and forth is stuck and makes a clicking sound. He still enjoys the other toys and continues to pull on the birdie. I am quite sure my child isn't so strong that this is the first time this has happened. It is cute though!"
4,Great toy but needs a little improvement.,"I bought this toy simply because I thought it was so cute with the little bird flying by. My daughter LOVED it!! We got it when she was around 5 weeks old, someone gave us the Baby Einstein one but she didn't play with it at all or even seem the least bit interested. But when we layed her on the mat of this one, and she looked up and saw the bird and her face just lit up. She played with it until she was about 4 1/2 months old. I agree with a previous review about the bird being easy to pull off when they start reaching up. I also need to add that the ""support bars"" have these little velcro tabs that are supposed to velcro under the mat and after a while they don't stick anymore and my daughter was able to pull the entire thing down on herself. I always sit close by and watch her play so it wouldn't have hurt her but after that first time it just didn't stand up like it should. But I would still recommend this to anyone of my friends for their little ones."
5,Love it,My daughter is 12 weeks old and absolutely loves this item. She has stayed calm and happy for a long time just looking and playing with it. I recommend this very highly. It seems to be pretty durable since she is starting to grab the toys and try to pull them to her. The music is not too loud for those of us that get tired of hearing the music and it changes enough that you don't hear the same song over and over.
3,Cute toy! Not very durable!,"We purchased this toy when our daughter was 2 months old. She loved to lay and watch the bird and grab for the toys. It was great until she could reach the bird at 5 months as she pulls it off and it falls on her face. I do like the fact that the toys can be taken off and used other places though. Our son broke one of the arches somehow (he's 2 1/2) I think it should be used up until they can reach the bird, great toy otherwise!"
5,Be the ruler of your own empire!,"I loved this book! Using nothing more than imagination and discarded items like aluminum cans and cardboard boxes, the author built his own imaginary empire as a child, and shows other children how to do the same. I'm 48, and I'm still tempted to build a city on my bedroom floor. The writing style was hilarious too. I really wish this book was in print, but it looks like I can get it used. It deserves wider recognition."
2,Crashing Turtle,"What it does:You put the turtle on the skateboard/car and turn the switch to ON and the wheels run until it hits something and the turtle falls off.My son who is almost three didn't think it was fun for more than 5 minutes and neither did I. It doesn't do anything but runs straight into a wall or anything that is in the way, crashes and stops.Cons: It is very hard to place Mikey the turtle back on the skateboard, you have to align both feet onto two things on the board and press firmly and sometimes it falls off again before you even put it on the floor. But once it is on the board and it is running it stays on until it crashes (be careful with molding and furniture because it is pretty heavy and runs fast).My husband and I decided to throw away the board and now our son has the turtle on a shelf in his room. I would not recommend this toy unless if it is for a child who is at least 5 or 6 years old who loves to see things crash."
2,"Crashin, Bashin, & Wastin Batteries Mikey","Kids,Do not make your parents buy this toy for you. Yes, you love all things turtle, but this is a WASTE of money and time and it takes a bunch of batteries to make it run. Oh, and it runs really fast-into walls, dogs, little sisters, mom's feet.They really could have made this a better/more fun toy. It just goes straight away and then bashes into things. You can't control it at all. Its a really poopy toy. Unraveling toilet paper is more fun.Read the other comment the mom before me wrote. She is 100% correct.I did however give it 4 stars for educational value. Because IF you do buy it after reading my review-you will learn the meaning of regret, remorse, and then patience as you try to prove me wrong by insisting this thing is fun. Shame on the TMNT for putting poor Mikey on this toy, even he doesn't deserve this kind of punishment."
3,Most Parents Won't Approve,"Like a lot of traditional stories, this one has the main characters die. The rat and mouse get eaten by hungry cats, and the frog by a duck, all because he wouldn't stay home like his Mama advised him to. Some people don't like unhappy endings to children's stories, but the reality is that kids who ignore warnings of danger can come to grief, and their friends along with them.BTW, the pictures didn't show up in my Kindle Fire."
2,Beware,2 piece combo: Home charger worked but car charger did not. Does not appear to be true Motorola products as stated in description. Car charger connection does not fit into the Motorola PEBL. I guess that's what I get for $5.99 plus shipping. It is hardly worth sending back. The shipping costs more than the chargers.
3,BARE BONES,""" Nameless"" is at the top of his game when solving murder mysteries. Recent murders are difficult but not unsolvable. This time Nameless is called upon to solve a murder that happened four decades ago. Called to do the impossible, he takes the case merely because the victim was a pulp writer. Nameless of course is is a pulp fan. Pronzini gives us a fair story as we follow Nameless in his quest of trying to quell the questions of a neurotic son determined to find out how his writer-father really died. Was it a suicide or murder? Come with Nameless as he attempts to uncover this mystery but in the meantime he must deal with his partner's brainless girlfriend and her impact on his beloved Kerry. This is not one of Prozini's best in the Nameless series but it will hold your attention."
5,A must-read for anyone interested in politics!,"Michael S. Cummings' view on political correctness is a welcome breath of fresh air for everyone on the left. I, for one, never thought that PC did anyone good. Now there's someone in the know (Cummings is a former chair of political science at the University of Colorado in Denver) who lays it all out as to why. In a nutshell, it's because PC done against people by the left is no better than what the right does to the left on a regular, daily basis. Cummings' views on affirmative action and child empowerment are also laid out in this book.This book is a must-read for anyone who is a political science major (like me), any journalist, or simply any American who's mildly interested in politics and society."
1,Too PC or not too PC? That is the question.,"The answer? Who cares! Academic works about non-academic topics like ""Political Correctness"" are a complete waste of time."
2,These Drinks Are Lousy,"Buy this book for Shag's art, not the drinks. These drinks are mostly modern sweet syrupy messes designed to please the moronic masses. Where is the appealing balance of sour and sweet? Not here! If you are serious about good tropical drinks, I suggest you seek out the Grog Log or Intoxica."
3,Have you actually tried the drinks???,"I love the illustrations and it's a great, fun book, but the drinks are very weird, super-sweet new versions of Tiki classics. These are not the drinks from the first Tiki Bar movement, nor from the retro-Tiki Bar scene. They're college bar sweet drinks with the same names as the Tiki classics. Sorry, hate to say it, but they're really not right. Check outSippin' Safari: In Search of the Great ""Lost"" Tropical Drink Recipes... and the People Behind Themfor the not-over-sweetened versions. Or just enjoy the illustrations in this book."
5,Julian,"Guauuuu. con estas memorias mi PC vuela super rapido los grandes juegos corren bien y no se calienta, mis amigos quieren unas iguales pero en Venezuela son dificiles de conseguir, no las dejes pasar."
1,wrong item and damage plastic case,i ordered 2 of TWIN2X4096-6400C5DHX and PC Universe sent me 2 of TWIN2X2048-6400C5DHX and the plastic case is damage when i received it. send me the right item otherwise refund ASAP.
5,Excelente,"Excelente memoria, no tengo mucho que decir, solo que hasta ahora es la mejor que he probado con un excelente precio."
5,Corsair is the best,"I've used Corsair for almost a decade and only had one stick of memory go bad. They replaced it within a week. Simply the best company. Maybe it's not the best price, but it stays cool, works fine, and I trust corsair."
3,"Jam-Packed with information, but tough to read.","Robert N. Rosen's ""The Jewish Confederates"" is jam-packed with fascinating information that can't be found anywhere else, but unfortunately it is presented as an ""info dump"" -- a tidal wave of names and dates written with all the page-turning excitement of an accountant's spreadsheet. Rosen's lack of familiarity with some of the more basic Civil War literature also leads him to repeat, at face value, some Civil War ""urban legends"" as fact."
3,Unknown American Jewish History,"Mr. Rosen's book examines an aspect of American Jewish History seldom if ever addressed, South Jews who fought for the Confederacy. Yes, most people interested in the subject know of Judah Benjamin, but Rosen goes well beyond this figure in his well written, thoroughly researched book to provide a comprehensive, fascinating, and thought -provoking examination of the issues involved in the Jewish support for the pro-slavery rebellion. But as Rosen establishes, for Jews it was never that simple, with the reasons as varied as the number of individual Jews who were Confederates. This is probably an issue that many American Jews might not want to address- the idea of a group known for its support of liberal causes supporting the most unjust cause- but Rosen, a native of Charleston,S.C. and as a lawyer and a historian, did a public and intellectual service by writing this book."
5,It's About Time,"Wonderful! I'm a Southern Jewish man who's very proud of his heritage, and I used this book when I was doing research for a paper I presented in October. First, the word needs to be spread that there was a Jewish Confederacy. (When I presented, my audience seemed amazed about this. And I might add that the paper was well-received.) Second, overall, Southern Jews were not that much different from other Rebels. No, they weren't all rich boys who could buy their way out of fighting. Third, it's too bad that certain Southern Jews have been omitted in U.S. history classes. I can't remember reading about or hearing about Judah Benjamin in high school or in college. This is a fascinating work for both Jews and non-Jews, and it's a beautiful book as well."
5,yum.,"This is an especially tasty Broadcast release. I let it slip through my fingers years ago and was afraid I would never see it again -- it has that kind of impact.[just an FYI: ""Drums On Fire"" does NOT appear on Future Crayon, which collects most of their EPs from this period and Haha Sound.]"
3,Buy the full length instead,"Broadcast have managed to survive the dreaded ""rip-off of Stereolab label"" and are truly the better for it. While Stereolab may have been the one of the firsts to ""go back to the sixties mod rock"", Broadcast have taken the new genre and actually produced something of merit. Sadly, this EP is not one of those brilliant moments. The Extended Play EP is really only a self-indulgent moment for a not so huge band which, riding off the popularity of their last album decided to release some B-sides which probably should have remained unreleased. The first track is amazing though..."
5,A family treasure,"I have become the keeper of the family copy of this wonderful book. It is filled with some of the greatest fables and stories that you'll want to share with your child. I'm trying to find a new copy for my daughter to keep for the rest of her life. Meanwhile, I'm going to have the one we have rebound. < a native New Englander >"
3,Fiercely fragmented,"3 1/2Retains an entrancing atmosphere of creepy but fun ambition, if unable to seal the whole deal with an uneven package."
5,I fall asleep by the end,I fall asleep by the end of this cd everytime. Nothing better. Very relaxing voice. Calms my entire body.
2,Not enough information protaining to the test.,I found that there is some information. But not all of the falconry sport. For expample the silhouettes of the different birds are not in there. I hate to say that I have found it dose not cover where the hole punch for the bell should be ether. Any how I am glad I did not buy it but readed it at the library.
5,Romance and non-stop action,"Nancy, Bess and George go to Ft.Launderdale and find themselves caught up in another mystery. I thought that this was a really good book."
3,Fragmented,"Ms. Turnipseed's debut efforts were grand, however the story was so fragmented. Subjects were interjected that never developed nor did they support any of the content that was established in the story(i.e. the implied Noire-Arike relationship/affair?). The story actually crystalized two thirds into the book at which time the cadence and language developed like a canvas of artistic expression. I would definately read her following works based upon the potential apparent in ""A Love Noire""."
5,Love and Understanding,"Finally, a relationship story that is not so totally predictable. The characters Innocent and Noire were well rounded and believable. Their love grew in a mature way that can set an example for having closure without having closure in a relationship. I hope there is a second installment of this great story. I'm looking forward to seeing how Innocent and Noire resolve their lives. Erica, girl you know you got it going on!!"
5,A Love Noire/A Love Supreme,"This is much more than a work of fiction; it is a commentary about the differences and similarities that thread people of African descent between and beyond the Diaspora. If you are a student of the human condition, this book is for you. Rare is the novel that can so carefully weave together seemingly disparate characters, and so carefully and richly texturize the story with art, culture, fashion, contemporary news and (not least of all!) love. RUN don't walk to buy your copies!!"
2,Don't Waste Money - Borrow From a Friend!,"I did not like this book what-so-ever. Innocent and Noire really got on my nerves. For Innocent to be 33-34 he couldn't make up his mind what he really wanted and nor could Noire. Now I will say the author did a wonderful job of detailing all of the places the characters visited, I will give her that. But this book could have been sumed up in fewer pages. They were either going to get together or they weren't. Didn't like it. If you want to read it, wait on the paperback or borrow it from a friend."
2,DISAPPOINTED :-(,"For the people who rated this book 4 or 5 stars, are you sure you reviewed the right book?? I'm an avid reader of all genre's and this book definitely missed the mark. The story was just BORING and undeveloped. There were too many cliche's, stereotypes and unoriginal material. Example: Innocent invites Noire over to his place and surprises her with an expensive new outfit and jewelry for an evening out. Where have we seen that one before?? And with all the unneccesary designer name dropping, I hope Ms. Turnipseed is getting some kind of kickback. Nice try."
5,A Great Read,"A Love Noire held my interest from the beginning until the end. I felt drawn into each scene, the journey was well defined. Turnipseed's provocative love story is a sophisticated blend of passion and class that spans the complexities of love in the African diaspora. A Love Noire is a fine debut, I'm looking forward to reading Turnipseed's future work. It was witty, insightful and sexy, a great read."
3,Okay Read,"I read this book by accident a year or so ago. When I saw this author had just released a sequel, I thought I would revisit this book.The part of the book that appealed to me was the actual relationship between two people of African descent who come from two different worlds. I can relate to that story and the challenges it brings.However, I too did not understand why lesbianism was introduced by the Noir. There was no history that indicated that she leaned that way. I also agree with some readers that Noir and Innocent were to old to be so indecisive, though I still found myself hoping they could find a way to work it out. It did seem to me they really cared for each other."
4,"Intriguing, tantalizing and confusing to this reader",Most of this book I enjoyed. There was a sense of confusion and frustration with the characters at times. I didn't understand why the author had to put that scene in with Noire and Afrike (those who read the book know what I am talking about). I am looking forward to the sequel. But I will admit that the characters came alive off of the pages of this book. This author did a great job of revealing them to the reader.
3,Stimulating ...but,"I loved this book...however. The ending was very vauge and the characters were too wishy washy. A grown man is cannot make up his mind and a grown woman so caught up in her roots she cannot function. It was almost like a self love/hate internal bi-polar disorder with her. I would have loved an ending where they were drawn to each other because they could not live without one another or a clean break. Do people really go through all of this psychological drama? I hope there is a sequel where both parties end up together and face other issues....but without the confusion. Let's get them married (which you rarely read about in black books and talk about the cultural differeces), Let's see them conquering child care or taking care of a family member, Let's see them struggle with work and crazy grand parents...enough said"
5,Insightful principles from an experienced doctor,"Although I do not have a teenager myself, I found this book to be applicable to my work in mental health. I have worked with John Oda and have gotten a taste in person of his dynamic approaches with clients and his expertise reveals itself consistently in unique, and always energetic, ways. ""Connecting with your Teen"" intertwines Oda's seven effective principles to resolve behavioral challenges in teenagers with detailed case examples of how the principles have been put into use. In his book, Oda posseses the ability to jolt people into the reality that they can take control of their own problems in order to have the meaningful existence that they hope for. The reader will find creative solutions and inspirational stories that can easily be applied in daily life with a teenager."
5,Great Shaving Cream,"This is the thickest shaving cream I have ever used, and it's very gentle on the skin. I've tried a dozen shaving creams, but use this one. It's expensive, and I'm not sure it helps me actually shave yet, but my skin is far less irritated after shaving than when I use other products."
5,ANDRE IS STILL INCREDIBLE,I HAVE FOLLOWED ANDRE COMEAU SINCE HIS REIGNDANCE DAYS.AND HIS NEW BAND IS INCREDIBLE. ANDRE STILL HAS THE VOICE AND THE TALENT LIKE ALWAYS. SO IF YOU LIKED REIGNDANCE YOU WILL LOVE MILKWEED!!!SO GO AND CHECK THEM OUT I KNOW YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED AS I KNOW I SURE WASN'T.
5,Lord Help Me,"Investing in Vice is a very insightful with straight forward and well developed ideas on the virtues of investing in vice. A must read for all investors and a great portfolio diversification strategy. The author is a sage voice in a sector where the hype, glam, politics, and zeal often overshadow the reality that many of the companies are great performers and stocks."
4,Buen poster,"Es poster es bonito aunque me da la impresion que el logo del concierto era a colores originalmente , pero en todo caso es una pequeña rareza"
5,Excellent Product,"I have had this since Christmas and it has been working without fail. It acquires every star and planet I aim it at. I'm constantly amazed it can find objects, even if the star is very close to another one. I use rechargeable batteries(maH)with no problems. Even after the most recent update, I'm having no issues."
5,Star gazer,"I have always wanted a way to map the stars and learn more about them, and this gadget really works. It does not magnify anything, just points you in the right direction, so you still need a good pair of binoculars or a telescope and a celestial map to make the experience mean something... Can't wait for Summer months when I can take more time outside on a comfortable deck chair and do some serious Star gazing..."
5,Celestron Sky Scout Rocks,"The SkyScout performs just as advertised. Take GPS to a whole new level with this device. It even tells you where objects are during the daytime or on the other side of the earth. It takes a long time to acquire satellites compared to my GPS and gets ""magnetic interference"" when within 2 feet of a car. But it recovers nicely without rebooting. It identifies objects flawlessly and locates objects without fail.Cons- a bit of a battery hog. Two AAs will last about two evenings of heavy use. I need reading glasses for the display in the dark, not in the light.Pros- impresses the neighbors! Much better than a chart!Wonder if/when the expansion slot will be useful???Would buy it again at twice the price!"
5,Very Cool,Easy to use and accurate. I am new to astronomy and wanted something to help me identify and find objects to aid in sighting a telescope. Very happy with the purchase!
5,Great Product !,The Celestron SkyScout is a fantastic product. Even better than I had anticipated. Very easy to use. Great for entertaining my grandson. Called Customer service for any upgrades. There were none. They were very helpful.
2,Had to return for exchange,Didn't work when we got it. We had to send back to get a new one. Disappointing because it was for my son for Christmas. We are waiting for the new one to come. We will see when new one comes.
1,It does me no good if it doesn't work,Ordered it. Couldn't get it to work or even turn on. Returned it. The replacement the sent out also did not work. Save yourself the time and frustration and buy an app for your phone or iPad that does the same thing.
4,Sky Scout,"I had an older SkyScout and was happy with it but unfortunably I dropped it and it never worked right again - kept getting the ""magnetic interference Icon"". The SkyScout had been particularly important to me for finding alignment stars for myMeade ls telescope so I had to get another one. During that time the SkyScout had come down in price but also worked much better.The GPS fix is much faster and the magnetic interference much reduced, in fact I can now get a gps fix at my desk whick is great. I can actually decide on which stars I want to use for alignment and what other objects to look at before even going to the scope rather using a sky map.John H"
5,Brilliant Buy,"I just bought my Celestron SkyScout today from REI, tried it out this evening and everything they said it would do is just what it did. The function that allows you to identify stars worked perfectly and the sky scout is very easy to aim and you always get the object that you were actually aiming at. Another function that the sky scout features allows you to find a particular object in the sky.The sky scout will even give you a list of 20 featured objects that are out that night. Once you have found an object you can do one of many things, these include, read about it, listen to a description, or look at scientific facts. Now I paid $230.00 for mine and I would recommend not spending to much more for it is just not worth that much more money, and you will be investing a lot into AA batteries because it chews them up very fast. Over all I am really pleased and I would recommend this product to astronomers if all ages."
1,Very poorly designed and manufactured product,"SkyScout does not operate as Celestron, the mfg. represents it to. Functions do not perform and results are rarely correct. The GPS is not accurate and close by best to the actual coordinates so beware. I purchased 3 units, 1 was returned once and 1 twice and they still do not work as represented."
5,indispensable for begginer astronomer,I am impressed by the simplicity and effectiveness of the equipment. It is a very useful tool to identify stars and planets. I recommend it
1,Garbage,"I've been through three of these and not one of them did anything right. They are absurdly sensitive to magnetic fields (I began to worry the minute I saw that it came with battery shields. Sheesh). The buttons are randomly responsive; on one occasion I could not scroll to the right in the display for around ten minutes, then all of a sudden it decided to move again. When the GPS tells a New Yorker he's in the Florida Keys, he can try entering the coordinates by hand, but they don't stay set. You never know where Sky Scout will think it is. Celestron suggested that I try different batteries, which I did, but who are they kidding? You'd be better off to hire my twelve year old son as a guide. At least he knows that Sirius is not in Auriga."
2,Wait for the next version,"I too am disappointed with this product, despite my high hopes. I found the same problems as others have already posted on Amazon.I suggest that you wait for the improved product. I'm sure Celestron has read these reviews and is working on improving device. They must know how many sales they have lost from all these negative postings.At $400 for a toy, uh, tool, I will wait for a better product."
2,Fun for the whole family,"We purchased this for my parents in their 70s but everyone enjoyed it, even our 9 year old son. It is a wonderful way to learn more about the night sky."
2,futile expectations,"The idea of the product is great; the execution is poor. Why would you want to waste hours to make the software, or whatever it takes to find a star, or to get the name of the star you happen to be watching."
5,get one,"This is an amazing gadget. When I first tried it, the GPS didn't work. I manually entered the coordinates and it worked beautifully. Now, after several weeks, everything works perfectly and automatically. If it were lost or stolen, I'd get another. I never upgraded the software .... Don't see the need and some reviewers have had problems (who knows why)."
3,"four stars, no longer three!","UPDATE: Celestron promptly replaced my defective unit with a brand new one that works as advertised. I would give it five stars but for the several incremental improvements other reviews have pointed out. Well worth having, even in iteration 1.0ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is such a cool idea, I wanted it to work. Unfortunately, mine worked exactly once and now will not acquire a GPS position anywhere, even in a open field miles from anything. Yes, it took too long to acquire a fix in the first place, yes it gobbles batteries, yes the firmware update process is an adventure, yes it should have a lens cap. However, it is still really cool and I expect once Celestron gets mine fixed (and probably after they come out with Sky Scout II) it iwll be much better."
3,"OK, but......","I got mine yesterday. I pointed it at Venus and Sirius, and ik worked fine. Later on I pointed at Castor and Pollux, and the screen showed Pollux twice, also when pointing at Castor. I had the same problems in the Big Dipper. I expected it to be more accurate!"
2,GPS Issues?,"I purchased the unit brand new, installed good quality batteries and installed the software on the computer and updated the software on the unit to newest version. in a clear field with NO METALS, power lines, watches ets. it displayed a magentic error icon as well as an odd lat/log. using another gps i entered the gps cord.from this unit and it shows that my field in maine has been telported to south eastern CHINA!!! I rebooted it many times and same results, new batteries same results. the moon i could see was indicated as not being present.entered in the correct gps cord. manually and it worked perfectly. also the magnetic icon dissapeared. however after shut down and startup it said i was in china and all needed to be reentered. gps, time and date.would also be nice if it could accept a low power eye piece of some kind.keep your reciept and use fresh batteries."
4,Slick,"A very nice item, indeed. It works! It is especially useful when showing the night sky to beginners. However I find a number of features annoying. Firstly, this device can find Venus in daytime (!) but you cannot see the red lights around the objective end in daylight. I discovered that if I put my hand over the objective the device still works and the red lights are visible and I can find Venus in daytime. The scrolling function is primitive and annoying. And rather than proper names for stars, their greek letters would have been more useful to me (but that's a personal issue). There are two major faults - the device has problems picking up the satellites and it goes thru batteries at an inconvenient rate."
1,Dead on arrival,"I too got my Skyscout yesterday, and the dreaded ERROR: GPS hardware problem detected popped up.[...]I have to wonder about Celestron quality control when such a large number of users get this error on brand new units."
2,tahoe99,"Returned product, short battery life when tested, Not set up to use rechargable batteries. Hard to view at nite time"
2,SkyScout Satellite Linkage,"This is a well thought out design and valuable tool for star identification. However, I could not get mine to link up with the satellites and went through batteries trying. The unit wouldn't even link up with the satellites over an almost clear sky horizon. Garmin technology for satellite linkage would make this product so much more valuable.Celestron SkyScout Personal Planetarium"
5,Mr.,It is a very useful and magnificant instrument. Very helpful for young astronomers(and old ones too). It is Great!!!
1,does not work!,"This celestron recieved did not work properly. Diagnostics says it is a problem with the gps part...but we cannor get ANY response from customer service, 2 weeks after first attempt.We contacted Amazon who immediately shipped a replacement skyscout and I returned the first one. It was the easiest most pain-free return in my life. Excellent customer service and the replacement works perfectly. REALLY cool product."
3,hard to read,this product would be wonderful if the digital could be easily read. to faint against the background
5,Excellent product,An excellent product. Easy to use and can accurately locate the stars. The only drawback is the price which is a little bit expensive.
2,Forget It,I had never been so disappointed in a product. The advertisements and reviews swayed me to purchase the product. I have a great interest in astronomy so I could hardly wait to get the Celestron SkyScout. Setting up the program on the computer was painless. It was capturing stars that was next to impossible. You cannot simply point at a star and capture it. I tried using a tripod but even that was difficult. I returned the product and went back to my dependable telescopes.
2,Still needs work,"This thing goes through batteries quickly. You will need to have extra sets handy. The built in GPS receiver is practically worthless, has yet to work. Fortunately my 5 year old Magellan works each and very time. Entering the Longitude and Latitude (yes it's reversed) manually does not allow for entering ""minutes"". It is also subject to ""magnetic"" interference, who knows from where??? On the positve side if you enter your location and the ""correct"" time it will get you close to what you looking for. It is also not Apple compatible which a real issue in that you have to keep/find a Win PC for firmwear updates.The concept has great potential and I am looking forward to another vendor producing a similar unit with an improved GPS unit. In the mean time, it is the only game in town, and at $[...] its not a cheap game."
1,"Great idea, too bad it doesn't work","I have a 15 year old Garmin GPS that can capture GPS satellites quickly in my backyard. I have a new Garmin Nuvi that can capture GPS satellites inside my house! For some reason the Celestron engineers decided to use some ancient GPS technology that can only capture the GPS satellites if you are in outer space actually sitting on one of the GPS satellites.After 3 nights of trying, I'm giving up and returning mine."
1,When it works...,"When it works it does exactly what it is supposed to. That's not often, however. My unit doesn't almost always doesn't work. I've tried it at several different locations. Most times my Skyscout couldn't find a GPS satellite if one fell out of the sky and landed on top of it. Don't know why I haven't thrown it out. Celestron ought to be ashamed of this thing. Definite ""not recommended""."
4,Very cool product.,"I love to look at the stars at night, now I know what it is I am looking at. Highly recommend this product."
4,Good for eduation; better with improvements,"We are new to astronomy and have used this for over a month. To date,we are pretty much satisfied with this product. The upgrade went smoothly and battery use not bad (though we are using rechargeable). My only dislikes are:1. Screen is difficult to read (for older, over 40 eyes that is; younger folks might not have issue). It could be the color and I wish there were a way to change it.2. You need to use a headphone or external speaker. Minor nit, but when you have a group of younger folks enjoying this product, it is nice to point and all listen at the same time so that everyone can find a unique object.3. Sighting is a little awkward and many choices sometimes come up (big circle and shaky hands, though a tripod might help the latter), so you need a little more background information to correctly identify what you saw.Other than that, we have been quite pleased."
1,Waste of money,"I bought the Celestron Skycout on Amazon. It was off kilter, as others have reviewed. It would identify objcts a few degrees to the right of where I pointed the lens (that doesn't magnify). That makes it a real problem to identify stars among clusters. I wrote the company twice about returning it or getting it calibrated, with no response. Still getting their promo emails though.So it's just a piece of junk in my closet that I can't seem to throw away because it cost almost $200. I had plans to buy a Celestron telescope with it, but obviously not now. Anyway, I bought the little speaker, which doesn't connect well and always falls off, and I was able to use it in the ""general direction"" of the star I heard described - a few minutes about the composition of the star and related mythology and a little history at times. It's interesting, but a bit gimmicky. My Android app can use GPS to identify stars. I'd rather just use that and a good telescope."
1,very bad quality control,"i got it and tried a whole night to lock the GPS signals, now i have to return it or get a replacement, what the quality control!i checked some discussion group on web and found couples of similar issues happend.but anyway i need one to teach my daughter the sky knowleadge....."
1,GPS Hardware error,"Like others I've seen here, mine was Dead on Arrival. It turned on but gave me the ""GPS hardware problem."" I contacted customer service by email (was on hold too long on their toll-free number.) They gave me a return authorization within 24 hours. I just sent this back to the factory UPS at my cost of $10.50. Once it gets there, it will be up to 30 days before I get it back. Apparently the warranty is 2 years which is good, but I would recommend buying this with American Express or other credit card which extends the manufacturer's warranty. I'll update later when I receive a working product."
4,Fun and Informative Tool,This is a fun and informative tool that anyone interested in the objects in the night or day sky should use. You can know where planets or stars are even in the daytime sky. It also can tell you your Latitude/Longitude of where you happen to be in case that is something you want to know.
5,Great product,Recent price reduction and free downloads of NGC objects a real plus! Using as a finder on my dobsonian. Works great!
3,For young eyes only!,We bought the Skyscout for a Father's Day present. 50 year old eyes that need cheaters to see can't see the small text in the dark. We have to hand over the unit to our son to read the description! We're disappointed...
2,Celestron SkyScout,"Product appears to work as intended; however, the display of black letters in a red field makes it impossible for me to read. My corrected vision is otherwise very adequate, but the faint letters are undecipherable to me."
2,Never worked due to electromagnetic interference,"I bought this after all the rave reviews only to be sadly disappointed. Not one person mentioned that the device does not work next to wifi recievers. I have a ten inch dobsonian reflecter that I cannot exactly move around my property with ease. Therefore I can only use a balcony outside my room. But because I have a wireless service that uses wifi the Skyscout failed to perform. No matter where I moved around the balcony the indicator always said ""Cannot connect to GPS due to electromagnetic interference"". So if you buy this Skyscout be sure you do not have a wireless service that could interfere with reception."
2,"No 64-bit support, SD cover does not close","I just bought the SkyScout IYA 2009 edition for my parents.The only difference between the normal edition and the IYA edition is the inclusion of an SD card with celestial events for 2009.Problem 1, when the SD card is inserted, the rubber SD card cover no longer fits.Problem 2, when you try to fit the rubber cover, the SD card becomes un-seated, and the skyscout no longer boots.Problem 3, the SD holder is a standard spring-loaded type as found in many devices, but this one does not properly release the card, it has to be pried out with a screwdriver.Problem 4, there are no USB drivers for 64-bit Windows operating systems, so you must run the updater utility on a 32-bit system.It is a little difficult to aim and target objects, specifically finding the object in the viewfinder is tricky, but with a bit of practice we did manage to target and identify."
1,Unreliable and no product support,"I received the SkyScout as a gift. I didn't use it for about a year and then decided to try it out. The Target function did not work right out of the box. I called Celestron and they needed a receipt to give me an RMA to return it. I explained that it was a gift and rather difficult to get the receipt (Person who gave it to me is 87 and now has Alzheimers) They would only fix it on a cash basis and if the repair bill was too high for me, they would charge to return it.Then, I decided to use the functions that did work and then the GPS promptly developed an error that said ""Error: GPS hardware problem detected. Please contact Celestron Technical Support. Still no receipt no support.In short, shoddy product right out of the box on first time use and no support. I own a Celestron C-8 plus but, from now on, I'm going with Meade products."
5,Great Release,This is the most comfortable release I have ever used. All you need is a strap and it's good to go.
2,"YOU WISH, JR WATKINS!!","YOU WISH YOU HAD EMINEM, YOU WISH YOU HAD HIS MONEY, AND YOU WISH YOU HAD HALIE JADE! THERE IS PURE JEALOUSY TOWARDS KIM SCOTT IN THIS BOOK. I DON'T THINK SHE WAS EVER CLOSE TO MARSHALL MATHERS AS A BEST FRIEND! IT IS FUNNY THAT EVERY TIME SHE WOULD TRY TO SPEND ""TIME"" WITH HIM ""SOMETHING"" WOULD COME UP! SHE IS EVEN JEALOUS OF DRE. YOU KNOW SHE WOULD LEAVE HER FAMILY IN A SCEOND IF MARSHALL WOULD EVER GIVE HER THE TIME OF DAY! DREAM ON ......"
1,JUNK,I think the person that wrote this book needs to find something to do with her time than just bash her (Family) as she put it.If you really miss then you wouldn't bash them like this peopleare not perfect I know Mrs. Wright I know she NOT PERFECT at all.Kim may not always done the right thing but she learning to control her life. Mrs. Wright I can't belive that someone would let you write a book this. One day you will learn and it will be to late for you.Anything to make money off of the peolpe that you so called LOVE.I hope you get some help Mrs. Wright and get your life together.
1,What a joke,"I am so sorry that i bought this book. I consider myself an Eminem fan and there was so much hoopla created on the radio about it that i deceided to buy it. I did not even finish it because i felt really bad about buying it and have every intention of sending it back.I got as far as the chapter entitled, ""Kim the thorn in Marshall's side"" and then I knew what the book was about; jealousy. Pure and simple. The reason why this woman nailed her cousin, Kim, so badly was because she is jealous of Kim. She wanted Eminmen and he did not want her and this was her way of getting back at both of them. It is human nature at its worst and if I could apologize to both Eminem and Kim for purchasing this piece of trash I would."
1,Transparent,"She may or may not have been close with eminem. She lacks credibility as she puts a horrendous spin and paints herself as the martyr and loyal subject to Marshall.This book is clearly about Kim and her obvious jealousy towards her. You can also read between the lines that she wants Marshall for herself and by answering his every whim - she hopes to get him.She paints him to be passive and a coward. I feel sorry for her, as the one item she despises about all around Marshall is the fact they use him for money - what is she trying to do?This book is poorly written and isn't worth the time or money."
3,Tell the truth the WHOLE truth,"I thought the book was good, but it seems to be leaving out a lot of detail. All those late nights at Slim's house and not one time did she mentioned she slept with him. About to get a divorce over being someone friend doesn't seem right to me. I think Jen had feelings for Slim and she wanted to take Kim's place."
2,Not a good read,"I think I paid close to $100 for this book and it was garbage. I guess it was interesting to read on his life, however she comes across as someone who is just jealous of Kim. The book certainly couldnt catch your attention and keep it. For a tiny little book (And I mean TINY) It took my like a month to read beacuse I just kept losing interest. Not recommended."
3,Not an attack on Eminem,"If you are looking for a ""National Enquirer"" style article on Marshall Mathers, you are best to buy just that... this book, although I question the motives, is more an attack on Kim Scott as opposed to an outright attack on Eminem. Fans/ enemies will not be as exposed to the ""real Slim Shady"" as one would hope. It offers a more ""Why Eminem is this way"" look at his personal life. Good for an interesting read but not a Marshall-hating document in the least."
4,Eminem really is a good guy,"I bought this book after hearing about it on the radio. I am a huge Eminem fan, and I have a lot of stuff about him, good and bad. I bought this book to get some insite on what Em is like as a family man, and this book provided me with a lot of information. I do not really care for the author, but she did tell some good stories, and Em seems like a really good guy. When I finished the book, I'm not really sure why Watkins is so upset with him. I believe that his allegedly crazy family members that moved in with him fed him a line. I would be mad if I was Marshall, with her airing out private information that he gave her, but it was still very intersting."
1,don't bother,"I wouldn't even bother buying this book-and that says a lot considering I'm a HUGE Eminem fan...The author can't even string together a sentence, let alone keep you entertained for an entire book!I hear there's one coming out in the Fall by that Rolling Stone writer, Anthony Bozza. MTV says it's the more ""intellectual one,"" looking at Eminem's role in hip-hop, etc. He wrote that first Eminem cover story-and in my opinion it's the best friggin' article I've ever read!! He did another one at the time of the Eminem Show. I'd save my money for that one."
2,no point on buying this one...,"J.R Watkins writing about the personal lives and relationships of Marshall and Kim and the family is really taking things too far. I can't believe that she was able to publish this book. This women has to learn that people enjoy privacy. Even if someone is a celebrity you don't need to do rude things like that.There is no point on buying this book unless you are obsessed with the life of this guy and need to stalk him. Other than that, get a life."
3,Let's hope she is telling the truth,"I feel sorry for this man Marshall Mathers. If what this woman writes is true, he has alot more friends now that he has $$. Again, if what she writes is true he is a much different person in private, which I guess she should have left private. I like his music and I think he worked his butt off to get to where he is at. All the power to him! I am a Mom, I feel badly for the way he was treated by his own Mother, I hope he can get past that part of his life. I would have enjoyed the book more if it was him that wrote it, then I know it would be true. Can't wait to see his movie!"
1,The Real Review,How on earth did this book get published? Has this lady ever heard of an editor? She is nothing but a jealouse person. She complains through the book about people trying to cash in on his fame and yet what is she trying to do.
1,English Composition 101,There is a large amount of required learning needed.I hope her 1 1/2 minutes of fame was worth it.
5,GOLDEN,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. IT DEPICTS A PERSON WHO HAD A DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD AND EVOLVED INTO A CONFUSED MAN. THE LIFESTLE OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS IS AS USUAL DECADENT, SELF-ABSORBED LITTERED WITH THE USUAL DRUGS, SEX, ""MUSIC"". ITS OBVIOUSLY THE PERCEPTION OF SOMEONE WHO PERCEIVES HERSELF AS HAVING A DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE LIFE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER. WHETHER THE CONTENTS ARE TRUE OR FALSE, IT WAS GOOD READING ON A SNOWY WINTER DAY."
1,sangean support,sangean support stinks. the ats-909 is a tremendous radio and too bad sangean doesn't back it up with good support. i was afraid to pull too hard on the folddown stand for fear that i would snap the stand off. i sent an e-mail to the sangean tech support to find out if there was any special way to pull down the stand (nothing is mentioned in the instructions referring to this stand.) i never received an answer and after some time worked it out myself. moral: great radio with no backup.
3,No Synchronous Sideband,"One very nice feature that this radio lacks is Sychronous Sideband. This helps with signal fading and adjacent channel interference. If you are serious about short wave listening you may want this feature. A much lower priced Sony has Synchronous Sideband, the ICF-SW7600G. On the other hand you won't get all of the cool presets with the Sony as you do with this unit. I'd advise anyone looking for a shortwave reciever to first pick up a copy of ""Passport to World Band Radio"" for its product reviews."
3,Complicated Controls,"Stations come in well enough. But them settings and controls were a but hard for me and I had a Sony ICF 2010 from 1985-1992. I almost gaved the radio up, but then I found also an abbreviated set of directions to get the radi up and running. I have finally set the local time but could not set world time. I have used my National Geographic Weather Station and clock for my UTC time clock since there is a four hour difference between Eastern Standard Time and UTC. You can see it in the photo I uploaded/ And I have not figured out the memory settings either."
2,Sangean ATS 909,"I have purchased this in the UK and find the radio to be very disappointing.It is reasonably sensitive on am and fm both shortwave and elsewhere. I could notice distortion on fades on the speaker.I also found that the quality for recording was far too bassy even with the tone adjustment to music and the band selection to wide. The quality from line output does not match the sound on the speaker.The switches on the side for tone, stereo to mono are only very thin plastic. The battery cover is small and flimsy as is the stand.Spend your money on a Sony 7600G or 100E. I realise now why people who buy the Roberts equivalent say it is a Sanean in wolf's clothing.I wish I had heeded advice on the web before buying."
3,"Good Radio, but there's better for less...","This is a decent radio. It sounds good and has a plethora oftuning features. But, it is expensive and offers only mediocreperformance for the money.For a bunch less cash you can have a more sensitive, moreportable radio, the Sony SW7600GR. While it doesn't soundas nice as the Sangean, it will pull in many more signals,has better SSB performance, plus has Synchronous Detectionwhich locks in signals and reduces noise and interference.Amazon's price on the Sony is almost $100 US less than theSangean. The Sony is the absolute best value in this classof receiver."
4,Powerful Little Radio,Good things come in small packages they say. Well this is certainly true for this compact little shortwave radio. Reception is clear and the sound is good quality in all areas.
4,Shades of the Elgin Marbles,I marveled at how the church could assume they held dominion over whatever would enhance its prestige. The authenticity of trying to get a wooden wheeled wagon through the deep mud following a spring rain reminds us that freeways are wonderful. Fascinating.
5,These guys are great!,From the first tune to the last- they're all catchy and fun to listen to. Check it out. You'll definitely be hooked.
1,Poor dvd copy,"Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd copy was extremely inferior. It made watching the movie an uncomfortable experience. I only watched a few minutes before giving up."
5,As Good as it Gets,"These are two masterpieces. Performed by what is noted on one of his albums ""Pianist of the Century"".I don't dispute that album title.It just don't get any better..."
4,Auditing Your Human Resources Department: A Step-By-Step Guide,This book added a new perspective to our work. It was very helpful.
2,Hurt by Lack of Editing,"This is one of several books on digital B&W; photography that I own. I find that the author is too economical in his explanations of how he got from step to step, often leaving significantly large gaps of assumed reader knowledge or prescience. But my main complaint is the horrible job of editing. There are mistakes and disagreements between the text and the illustrations and the illustrations and their headings. If you're not already comfortable with fooling around with Photoshop tools, and just trying things, you can get totally lost trying to figure out whether the text, heading or illustration is correct.The book is attractive and well presented. However, after many years as a technical editor, I'd have been embarrassed to let this one go."
2,Confusing,"I found this book to be very confusing. Many of the images did not match up with the text and I spent most of my time trying to decifer what was meant to be said.The author obviously knows his material well, but the editing made it very unenjoyable to read."
2,Adequate,"Freeman's Mastering Black and White Digital Photography provides brief but adequate coverage of color to grayscale conversion as well as manipulation of the resulting grayscale image (eg preserving shadow and highlight detail, adjusting curves). It assumes Photoshop, so techniques such as channel mixing may not be relevant if you use another program. It is VERY poorly edited: text and figures sometimes don't match, many figures are so small that the modifications being illustrated are difficult or impossible to see, some figures are printed across the gutter, etc. I recommend looking at this book before purchasing it to see if it provides you with enough value for the money."
3,Disjointed,"I did not care for the 2 page snippets used to describe most of the topics in this book. In addition, the book did not seem to flow well. For example, some black and white conversion techniques were listed in one part of the book, whereas others were listed in other chapters, making it difficult to find and compare them.Significantly, most of the key information was not included in the text itself, but rather in captions accompanying the images. Not only is the font size for these captions small, but sometimes it was hard to determine the proper sequence of the images.While this book does provide some useful information, I have purchased other books that are both more informative and better written."
1,This is a Photoshop book,First and foremost this is a Photoshop book. If you don't have Photoshop the majority of the content will not be useful to you. The book is an editing nightmare. The author should be embarrassed.
1,It is a fake copy! Lost all faith in amazon.,"I used this program in my classroom when I taught kindergarten and first grade. It was a fabulous supplement to our writing curriculum and my students loved it. I now have a kindergartener of my own and wanted to purchase the program for us to use at home. I ordered it from amazon, but actually purchased it from a small vendor on the amazon website. When the software arrived I was shocked. It does not look at all like the disks I have in my classroom it appears to be a fake copy, the disk has no formal cover and the plastic wrap has been hand sealed. I contacted amazon with my concerns about the vendor and they didn't care that a vendor of theirs is selling copies of software. I was told by amazon that I would need to contact the vendor myself. Interestingly enough, from the looks of the package the disk came in I need to contact some guy in Kentucky. Based upon this experience I have lost all faith in amazon as a safe place to purchase on-line."
3,Coastal Guiide to Coastal North Carolina,This a well organized and written guide. But it obviously includes only the sites that were willing to pay for the advertisement. Several very good marina's are conspicuous by their absense.
2,Okay for ideas,"This book is the typical package of business ideas. The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful. In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work. The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another. However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work. The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type. Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one."
2,Like a Money magazine article stretched out into a small book,"This book is essentially 100 two page book reports on various small businesses that ordinary people can run. It isn't revolutionary and it isn't exactly accurate. It was nothing like I expected and not helpful to me at all. I give it only 2 stars because I believe it was innaccurate on several details and that is rather a big deal. You can get most of this information in a magazine. I'm sure for some it will be helpful, but for me it was rather a waste of time."
4,A very interesting book to ponder,"I am not sorry that I bought this book. Lisa Rogak is very insightful and she gives lots of useful info and theories.However, I'd like to recommend that you also buy a copy of Untapped Wealth Discovered. This book is written by two very smart and sensible authors who have lots of very valueable info and knowledge to impart.Jeff Marquis and Kerry Harrison should be taken very seriously. Kerry has the same name as me but it's not why I like this particular book.Good going to Lisa."
5,Fans Love It!,Its a big hit with the kids and totally helps me to stand out from the rest of the fans. I love it! Fans Love It! I can't complain.
1,thumbs down,"Its great for reference but if your taking exams for inspectors, etc. it doesnt show tables so better buy the actual building code."
2,weak doo!,"yo, this album is hella weak. mac dre put some old rich the factor on it from over 3 years ago. i dont know whats up with this fool. he used to be sicc. late"
1,mac dre is done,"this album is the worst i have every mac dre cd and he has fallen off the bay area map. i would consider him main stream. he might as well be on the radio with all the other horrible mcs. mac dre if your out there stop making these wack ass beats return to your prime like back in the day when you were making classics like rapper gone bad, stupid doo doo dumb, the ropalation , cutthoat committee an young black brother. if your dumb enough to think that mac dre is better than ever then you should slap your self then come see me and let me slap you. make dre will never be better than he used to be i should know because i am from vallejo and i have been listening to bay area rap since i was like 9 years old.............................reppin the bay till my casket drops"
2,Not what I expected,They need a better product description for this video. It was not what I expected.
2,Not the tribute Chico deserves,"This disc is patently inferior to Chico's earlier recordings -- be sure to check the Verve anthology, ""Cuban Blues,"" for Chico and his own bands at their best. ""The Original Mambo Kings"" is another terrific starting point -- several of the most important pieces that he composed for Machito's Afro-Cubans can be found there, including ""The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite"" and the famous Cubop standard, ""Gone City."""
2,"Good concept, but not interesting enough.","""Now All We Need Is a Title: Famous Book Titles and How They Got That Way"" is a cute book, but nearly all of the books mentioned did not pique my interest. Nearly none of the ""classics"" that are popular today are written about and it lacked an index. A disappointment - I do not recommend."
3,Groovy,Cool movie that I first saw in 76. Shaw is great. Good story with nice poetry by the two buddies about ladies
2,One Star is reserved for Airport 79,"I have recently viewed some of my favorite worst films ever. Airport 79 takes top (bottom?) billing. If you recall, these were a series of airplane disaster flics (Airport, Airport 75, Airport 77, and the grand turkey of all time: Airport 79). These movies gave birth to the spoof, Airplane, though after Airport 79 there is no longer a need for a spoof movie.Swashbuckler is supposed to be a light comedy action pirate movie a la the current rage Pirates of the Caribbean. Though the cast is tremendous, the acting, the action scenes, the drama, the love story, the building tension leading to the finale is anything but tremendous. About the best thing I can say for this movie is that it is not quite as bad as Airport 79. This movie is far and away the worst pirate movie I have seen. I cannot think of a near competitor.I was surprised by the number of very generous 5 star ratings. About half the reviews give this film top honors."
3,Good Rainy Day Movie,"I first saw this film as a kid on a double-bill with ""The Hindenburg"" and enjoyed it immensely. Revisting it for the first time since then, it's still a good film but lightweight fodder. Director James Goldstone is going for the rollicking and high-spirited and he succeeds for the most part. I thought that Robert Shaw and Genevieve Bujold, for the most part, were just phoning in their performances. On the other hand, Peter Boyle as the evil Lord Durant relishes his chance to play villainy. The always dependable James Earl Jones gives a high-spirited rendering of Nick, Shaw's Red Ned Lynch's co-hort. This is the kind of film you don't so much as seek out but stumble upon. I will say this much, though. I enjoyed this old-fashioned homage to high-seas fare more than the CGI dominated ""Pirates of the Caribbean""."
1,A huge waste of time & talent!,"Have you ever really looked forward to seeing a movie and then been terribly disappointed after actually seeing it? That's how I'd describe ""Swashbuckler"". I hated everything about this one. The good guys weren't funny, and the bad guys were simply creepy. I know garbage when I see it, and this movie was garbage!"
5,Swashbuckling fan for 24 years!,"I saw this movie in 1976 at the theatre when it was first released. It went to see it twice. It had action, great actors with amazing voices, humor, romance and a wonderful score. What more do you want from a movie. For many years I forgot about it until I saw it at the video store and shared it with my teenage daughter. She loved it and has asked me to order it, which is why I am doing this review now. After 24 years, it's still a fun film that can be watched over and over again."
1,Go with the re-issue of 'Dr. John plays Mac Rebennack',"It pains me to write this because I love this guy, but if you own 'Dr. John plays Mac Rebennack' I believe you're going to ask yourself why would anyone believe I would want to listen to this master play solo blues piano on anything other the best acoustic piano they could find for him at the time.Compared to the other CD mentioned, this one makes one think of DJ putting on a concert in the KMart keyboard section. Thank god the DVD includes DJ on an true acoustic."
3,Mostly good but ...,"The title of the product is a tad misleading ""All by Hisself ... Bonus DVD"". The DVD portions is good, but it's not a live concert DVD. The CD portion is the main part of the product it's decent and I am happy with it, but feel like the title could be written better so as not to confuse folks into thinking it's a concert DVD."
5,Spicy Cookbook,"My wife saw some recipes in this cookbook at my son's house. she wanted a copy for herswelf. We ordered a copy from Amazon. A ""used"" copy arrived 2 weeks later by USPS. It was like new. We have enjoyed several of the recipes. A great buy!"
3,Misleading Title,"If you purchase this book, don't expect any tips on how to channel! In fact, the author specifically states that she will not be revealing any such information, as it is ""dangerous"" to channel without a teacher actually present. Instead, the book focuses on becoming prepared, emotionally and spiritually, to be a channel. Presumably, you will then go find a teacher to help you with the actual channeling. While there were a few good points made in the book, it was more an exposition of the author's belief system than helpful how-to's. Keep your dictionary handy, as the author (a former librarian) seems to enjoy showcasing her exotic vocabulary."
4,Very good video but needs synopsis,"This is a very good video for people who are interested in getting ballet on video. It includes four short ballets, each in a different style and by a different composer, and all excellently performed. Unfortunately, it does not have the story of any of the ballets, which makes it hard to follow the action for anyone who is not already familiar with these ballets. If they had included a synopsis I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,Good Performance,"The quality of the taping was superb....sound, picture clarity. I've seen some recording of live ballets that were pretty awful in sound and picture. As for the perfomances themsevles.....it was good, not great. The Kirov is considered to have the best Chore in the industry, yet they were hardly on stage. All in all, it's not a bad purchases if you are a ballet enthusiast."
3,A passable presentation,"Not what I expected. Colors too gaudy, the dancing less than what is expected from this company."
5,Important addition to your first aid kit.,This came in handy right away. Very good results~We cut them to size. Nice product display alsoMust buy
1,"Waste of time, money and energy.","I am a 32 year old educated woman and I like to consider myself mechanically inclined. Whoever created this gadget must not have children, because no child could be left to figure out how this contraption works. Gears, assemblies, chambers etc. after putting it all together, the top did not close tightly and we had to hold it in place to get the gears to turn. We ended up with an over frozen mess, and when we took the lid off to scoop the contents out, half of the 12 ounces of slurpee we were hoping for melted all over the counter! The pour spout never worked and my daughter was very dissapointed when I put the whole thing in the recycling bin. Which by the way, is a good place for this toy."
1,Terrible. Dont Waste your Time. Get an Ice Shaver.,"This thing is terrible. It just spins and doesnt make the ice slushy. Just gets things cold. Left on for 10 minutes. It is loud as a vacuum cleaner, wastes all the C battery power. It is too hard to clamp and unclamp. You need to be a man to do it or at least have a good grip. The spout leaks. Too many negatives. The worst is the anticipation of getting a slurpee when all you get is a mess and you have to end up going to 7 11 again and pay 2.00 for a slurpee when you thought you could get one at home. I am a regular amazon buyer and usually never write reviews but this time i had too. I dont want people to spend there money on junk."
2,Not worth it,"My husband bought this for me and I was excited to use. The machine at our gas station is ALWAYS broken so he thought this would be great for me. After reading all the directions and making sure I knew what I was doing, I started to make my first slurpee. The machine was incredibly loud and seemed to be getting bogged down, all the slush went to the front and I had to keep switching from forward to reverse, and it wouldn't dispense. It tasted pretty good but was too much of a hassle. It doesn't make a lot either. It'd be best to just go and buy one at the store rather than go through all this trouble!"
1,Part 2 Of This Thing is Awesome,"After about three hours, my Slurpee machine broke. It wouldn't make a slurpee, it came out like a really cold drink. I returned it for a full refund. Buy the Simpsons Squishy maker instead. Yeah, you have to crank it, but it makes a great ICEE. Take My advice, DON'T BUY THIS SLURPEE MACHINE PERIOD!"
1,2 defective products,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for a niece, but it didn't work. We exchanged it for a new one which also did not work. I wouldn't recommend this product at all, and only chose ""1 Star"" because I was required to fill in a field!"
2,great concept but didnt work!,Purchased the machine for xmas gift - we threw out the box - put it together - new batteries - twice! - and the motor never ran.now we have no box to return or exchange it in - we were looking forward to using machine. too bad!
1,Terrible,Putting together wasn't so bad. It would just spin once or twice then stop. Could not keep turning long enough to make a slurpee! The idea is a good one...just that this product stinks!
1,Don't waste your money,This is a terrible product. I have purchaced 3 of them and all of them had power issues. We tried multiple sets of batteries with no luck. I was never able to get any of the units to turn on. There is a serious flaw in the unit that prevents the batteries from giving power to the unit. Frustating part is you don't know it doesn't work until you spend 15 min. putting it together!.....pick another product!
1,SAVE YOUR RECEIT!!!!!!!!!!,"This product does not deserve any stars. But seeing as I have to give it at least one. I begrudgingly give it one. My daughter had to have this for her 5th birthday. I was skeptical. Just another made in china, cheap toy that does not work. My easy bake oven from 30 years ago still works. Too bad people do not have any pride in their products.I worked on this thing for well over an hour. It did not want to go back together then it would not turn. A 10, 9 and 5 year old who were all soooo excited. I kept trying till finally they came to the realization. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!"
1,FURIOUS!!!!!!!!,"Well let me just say that my college experience has been succesfully destroyed by the Slurpee Maker's short tenure in my life.It all started on a fun night at the Times Square Toys 'R' Us. Although a trip on the big ferris wheel was not involved, purchasing the 7-11 Slurpee Maker surely brought excitement to the trip.That was until we got back home. After a 3 a.m. run for 4 C batteries (who uses C batteries, anyway? Come on 7-11...invest in a plug for crying out loud), we assembled the machine only to find that IT DIDN'T WORK.Maybe it's partially my fault for not keeping the receipt, but no one should have to keep a receipt for a new product like this!!!!NEVER AGAIN, 7-11. I'M GOING TO WAWA.-The battered consumer"
1,DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS TOY!!!,"My son begged for this toy for his 7th. b-day. I finally gave in and bought it. $30.00...we just spent the better part of an hour washing, assembling, etc. the machine...measuring luke warm water and salt...and crushing ice. And the machine quit working after 48 seconds. Yes...48 seconds...because we were timing the ""creation"" of the Slurpee w/our kitchen timer. I let it sit...I followed the trouble shooting directions...I just kept trying. I finally gave up and made the Slurpees in our juice maker. And guess what? The kids don't even like them. I am washing the machine AGAIN...and taking it back to the store. My son can find something that will WORK for the $30.00. Don't waste your time and/or money and your children's high hopes on this product."
4,Pleasently Surprised,"I wasn't expecting much out of the slurpee machine after reeding these reviews and had decided not to buy it, but I'm a big slurpee addict, though, so my husband bought this for me, more as a gag gift and as something that our daughter and I could enjoy together.There are a lot of pieces, but I found assembly quite easy. While I can see where it would give an 8yr old problems, for instance, any adult helping out should be able to put the machine together without any trouble. It all goes together and comes apart for cleaning quite easily.The keys to making a successful slurpee are using a drink with a high sugar content and having the right ice/salt/water mixture. No, you're not going to get a huge amount of slurpee, and you're going to have to refill the ice chamber if you want to make a lot, but for an inexpensive child's toy, it does quite well.It will be a refreshing little treat on hot summer days."
4,Fun,I bought this at Toys R Us. It works great I don't know were the others people were. The only thing it takes a lot of battery power. Great slushy machine
1,What a pain!,What more can I say - It's a huge pain in the neck to put together to get a small amount of frozen drink. This is not at all a fun thing.
4,better than expected,"I bought this for my niece because she asked for it. Otherwise, I would not have purchased it based on all the poor reviews. I haven't seen it work, but apparently she and her mother are very happy with it."
1,What a mess !,"Don't bother with this item. Save your money and buy 30 real slurpees instead.First impressions say a lot. First try with 6 year old failed. Followed directions to a T, and used orange soda which is loooooaaaaadddded with sugar. Finally reverted to poaring out soda (most of which ended up on the floor thanks to help from Dad) and sticking in frig. Child was just as happy.Will try a second time just because I'd hate to have a toy beat me and win, but enough about my personality flaw.Save your cash."
2,Needs improvement,"My son got this toy for his birthday and it did work - we used fruit punch and it froze much quicker than I thought it would. However, it would not come out of the poor spout - we had to take the whole thing apart to get the slurpee out, by that time it was melting.It only makes one small slurpee at a time and you have to replace the ice after each use - it doesn't stay frozen long enough to make more than one drink.It was a cute toy, but we did return ours due to the hassle. It wasn't worth the time for the results we received.Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers...it's more an adult toy - the only part the children can do is poor in the liquid and turn it on. It's quite a process to make one small slurpee."
5,Itz a mean raccon slushi maker machine. ITz great like frosty flakes.,When i get back into my mobile hoem i'll like to nsit down for a rs(racoon slush). I finished chasing out of the pig pen i just neded one. Trust me a rs is better than a ps( piggy slushi). Peace fo shizzle.
1,Slurpee Maker can't make diet slurpees!,Specifically bought this product to make low-calorie Slurpees like you can get at 7-11. Only to find out that you must use sugar with this product in order for it to work. This information was not included in the description of this product. Will be returning this product for a refund.
1,"Do not buy. Your wasting your money, believe me!","What a huge disappointment. This so called Slurpee Machine is made so cheap I don't know how 7-eleven wouldn't be embarrassed about it. I disappointed my granddaughter by giving her a faulty cheap Slurpee Machine for Christmas only to find the thing doesn't even work. She didn't get one Slurpee drink from it. Her parents made several attempts and re-reading the instructions to make sure they were following them right, but no, the thing is just a piece of junk. Because of this being so cheaply made, I really disappointed my granddaughter. What she learned from this is that she now knows how easily you can get shortchanged buy using your hard earned money to buy a cheap plastic toy."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I got this at Christmas and was exited at first. It took us about 45 minutes just to get the thing together. Then, you have to fill the metal thing with ice, salt ,and warm water. We put some coke into the thing and we turned it on. it took a little bit for the coke to start turning into a slurpee. Once it started getting thick enough, the motor almost stopped because it was just starting to get thick. Finally it was ready. I pulled the thing so the slurpee would come out. Hardley anything came out. Instead we opened the lid and just scooped it out. It tasted pretty good. Now, you have to clean it. You have to take it back apart and clean it piece by piece. It takes forever! I DO NOT RECOMEND this item."
2,Not the greatest,"This was to bring a piece of home to deployment without costing too much or being difficult to transport. So far I haven't been able to make the machine achieve the desired product. Albeit I only tried once, after wasting an hour washing parts, then crushing ice and trying to figure it out, I'm not exactly hyped to try it again. I would say this is a bust. If you are at a residence, get something a little bigger and better. This only is supposed to transform one can of soda at a time. It was a little disheartening."
1,Piece of Crap!,I was excited to try out this slurpee maker. I ignored the reviews and thought I would try it myself. I followed the instructions and the drink never froze. I left it on for 20 minutes and it did not work at all! Get a high-speed blender/smoothie maker instead!
4,Works just as described,"I purchased the Slurpee Maker for my daughters 6th birthday. Use the instructions and you will have great success with the Slurpee Maker. The only delay I had in making the Slurpee was the ice canister didn't turn on the first attempt. Checked the directions... followed them and had the first Slurpee ready in 5 minutes. The maker works fine, cleans up easy but only makes around 12 to 15 ounces at a time."
1,save your money,it never worked right out of the box....after many tries we could not get the thing to turn round..even when we emptyed it...was not happy with it at all
5,excellent and to the point!,"This is a great explanation of Catholic beliefs by a wise priest. It is not so much a listing of dogma but an explanation of why we believe what we believe. This book is loaded with common sense that everyone can and should learn. The first part examines the nature of God. It proves his existence, shows how he works in the world, discusses the fallacies in pantheism and atheism, and talks about the attributes 0f God. The second part examines the life of Christ. Why He was what He said He was and couldn't be anything else, how He proved Himself, and the resurrection. The last part goes on to prove the Catholic church was the one founded by the apostles. It discusses the early church, the nature of the true church, and the papacy. This book is a great apologetic work and you would not be wasting your money."
4,"Good, but big","We bought this to suppliment a large garden cart. It turned out to be too big to maneuver into tight spots so we exchanged it for the smaller version which is also quite a bit lighter and more maneuverable. Folding is easy, but not instantaneous. Ground level loading is a great feature."
1,Critical component failed very quickly,"Less than a month after purchasing, and having been used perhaps 10 times, the flywheel connected to the tuner is stuck in one position. A radio that can't be tuned isn't of much use."
3,"It *does* have AM Band (a response to ""false info"")","A fellow reviewer named Mary L. Stein ""TALK SHOW JUNKIE"" writes:>> despite the advertising there is NO AM BAND ON THIS RADIO!!This is quite untrue. This radio has AM Band, it is however labeled as ""MW"" (as opposed to being labeled ""AM""). ""MW"" stands for ""Medium Wave"" and is just another name for ""AM"" (which stands for Amplitude Modulation). Although labeled differently, it is quite obvious once one uses this radio that MW are the AM stations."
4,very nice radio,This is a very good radio for the money and very battery friendly. Preforms up there with a lot of the big dollar radios for a very reasonable price.
1,No AM band,I got this to listen to AM talk radio but it does not have the AM band as advertised. Amazon even sent me another with the same problem. You can zoom in on the picture on this page and see that it is not there.
1,Radio Did NOT WORK,Very dissappointed with this radio. I gave it to my Mom as a gift and 'she' returned it to me because it did not work. :(
4,RE: Sangean Shortwave Radio,"Just hard to find the exact freq. the shortwave stations are on. I think the digital would be more helpful, otherwise the reception is very good."
3,vicki,"Just okay in my opinion, I got this radio to be able to listen to NPR and BBC news at home. Reception in my home in Santa Fe, New Mexico is just okay, not great, pretty fuzzy most of the time. A little disappointing, but since it was inexpensive, no great loss. Maybe it will work better in other places."
1,Hopefully you will not have to return it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my husband to listen to the REDS on the radio and when I received it, it did not pick up the station I needed. I returned it within one week. Waited to get my money placed back on my CC for 3 weeks, finally, I contacted the company. they did not get back with me. I then tried to use the A-Z Gaurantee through Amazon. Finally, Amazon was able to reach the company. They said that they never received the radio. I then forwarded the receipt of shipping from post office where I had returned it, and they still said they would not refund my money. So, needless to say, I have no radio, they still have the money I payed them for the radio and to ship it to me, plus the money I payed out to ship it back to them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nice Radio,"Nice starter radio for SW lots of freq to tune, live near the beach and the many stationcome in OK ( Not great OK ) Hey its a Nice starter radio, also Bought the FR200 Now thats great"
1,poor and horrible,"I ordered the Sangean sg 622 and when I recieved it it only picks up the FM stations only the SW bands did not work at all, Now I have to go thru the trouble of sending it back and going thru the refund process, Shame they don't test them before they mail out. Sad experience."
3,"Caution - easy to break, hard to repair with wrong adaptor","This was a neat little radio, great to have with me when working in the garden etc. The main flaws were bad sound with weaker stations (while my other radio sounded almost perfect) and being hard to tune (the tuning wheel wasn't very responsive). However, being rather cheap, I didn't expect much more from it.The reason why I don't have it any more though is that I accidentally broke it by using too high voltage (I have a variable voltage adaptor). I think it blew a fuse, this is usually a trivial thing to replace. However, this radio turned out to be virtually impossible to disassemble and repair with reasonable effort and tools that I had at home, so I ended up getting a different model from RadioShack."
2,Don't spend mony on it,It doesn't have AM as it says. Very poor quality sound and a lot of distortion. the Shorwave doesn;t work properly. Dotot buy it.
3,Good second/portable/emergency radio,"If you're serious about shortwave, this isn't the radio you want, but this radio is great as a ""do- I-want-to-pursue-this-shortwave-thing-further"" radio, or as a lightweight travel rig. It'll will bring in the higher-power shortwave stations: BBC, Radio Netherlands, Radio Japan etc. Sound quality is quite good. Like most analog radios, knowing what frequency you are on is impossible, but for casual tuning, or to get a taste of what shortwave has to offer, this radio is fine. It's also small and light enough to make a decent travel portable (and cheap enough that if you lose it, it's not the end of the world.) And, its a good radio to toss into your emergency preparedness kit.It will perform better with an external antenna ""boost"" - just take a 10'-30' piece of wire, attach a couple of alligator clips, and save yourself $15 by not buying a ""reel in"" antenna."
2,electronics OK but mechanical tuning and volume poorly made,"Have owned this little radio a few years. The tuning failed to work well within several weeks. It is a very cheap elastic string around a pulley and in colder weather...even 50's...it loses friction and slips making tuning almost impossible. And yes, the volume knob is loose as mentioned by others. Reception of FM and Am are pretty good. There is only limited reception of shortwave with antenna fully extended and with trying to aim antenna to fine tune a station. So, if you leave your radio on a favorite station and the poor tuning mechanics aren't a bother this might be an acceptable choice...but radios half the price are around with no cheap mechanical parts...it's a shame they would use fairly good electronics but allow such cheap tuning and volume mechanicals to make the radio a poor choice."
4,excellent emergency radio,"I bought this radio as my place loses power a lot and right away I got great reception! The size of it is about that of a paperback book, but lighter. It takes 3 AA batteries and is easy to tune, I haven't had need for the atenna yet. I haven't tried to reach some of the international stations, but am happy with the product."
2,This radio comes short of my expectation.,"This little radio does not meet my expectation. Although it performs all right on FM ,it does fairly poor on SW and that's what i wanted to use it for. Of course I realise that's not the top of the line but I was expecting better reception on SW.I should have chosen a better model."
1,Sangean SG-622 radio,"Don't bother buying this item. It is not only inexpensive, it is totally cheap. Even for the money, it is junk."
4,Nice little radio!,"Receives wonderfully, but cheaply made. Hope volumn knob stays on for a while. BL"
2,Do not buy,The radio sounds very good if one can ever find the right spot for it and find the angle for the antenna.I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAINP PURCHASED AT AMAZON
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","I paid around $40.00 for this piece of junk. DO NOT BUY! We used the radio for less than 8 months before if broke. The company wants you to give them $8.00 to send back, and then the cost to ship and insure. By that time, you're up at around $15.00. Not worth it! Our little $10.00 radio was better than this one."
1,Not a great option,Product was bought as a gift- turned out to be an embarrassment . The volume did not work properly- there was one setting that was barely audible with no control. AM and FM was received but SW was not available. Not sure if it was just damaged goods or the product line itself was at fault. Item was returned.
3,Good radio for beginners /nice price,This is a very good radio for folks just entering the world of shortwave listening . The radio has a very good sound from the built in speaker and the tuner on AM/FM and SW seem to be pretty good . I have compared this radio to the popular Sony sw11 which is Sony's analog mulitband equivalent ...the Sangean has much better sound and about the same level of selectivity from the tuner . The Sangean is also about $20 cheaper . My only knock on this radio is that even though the tried to keep the price down a telescoping antenna would have been nice . Other than that no real complaints . A very good buy !
2,SW problems,I purchased this product because of the Shortwave but it turned out having some difficulties. It couldn't get any of the sw stations.
4,Good radio for the price.,"This is a good low end radio, the sensitivity is good and signal to noise ratio is good on a low to medium signal. the selectivity is only average it still is a very good radio for the entry level listener. I am a ham operator and bought this rig for a cheap receiver for camping."
5,A short review of a short history,"This book is like Ptashne's ""Genetic switch"" but more personal and at a higher scientific/intellectual level (read ""Genetic Switch"" first if you have no idea what it is). ""The lac Operon"" is annotated with many short, colourful, 'behind-the-scenes' anecdotes about the people who were (are) doing the science. These anecdotes, and other historical facts, do an outstanding job of placing the research questions of the time (the answers to which are today taken as 'self-evident truths') in context."
5,If you see one case you've seem many ...,"If you want to have a good idea how a scientific discovery is made in biology, in fact in molecular genetics (how genes are turned on and off), read this book and recommend it to your graduate students. One learns, through the discussion of the relevant work, how the subject developed until a complete hypothesis is proved and accepted. Particularly interesting is the section that comments about the many papers that were published by reputable investigators but turned out to be wrong and ended up in science's vast wastebasket. This self-correcting ability of science requires social scrutiny and time."
2,Not sure that its doing anything.,"Bought this on a tip from a friend that it could somehow aid in weight loss by keeping your cortisol levels from getting out of controll. It has benn said that excess cortisol in your system will defeat your attempts to lose weight, so therefore by managing your cortisol levels you will have a better chance at being successful at shedding those unwanted pounds.So I bought the stuff and took it for a week. I took the reccomended dosage (although my friend said that she was told to take 3x the reccomended dosage for the best results) I dont think that I noticed any changes honestly. Still got irritable and stressed at the same things I always have.Also made be burp alot, and they were gross tasting burps too.So thats my experience, not sure if it was helpful, buts thats how it went."
4,"Great story, tough read","The story lines are intricate, yet realistic. The characters are interesting and compelling. The writing style nearly ruins the whole experience. I almost wish the author had given his plot outline to someone with the ability to write clearly and logically."
5,Forget Erykah,"This 2006 album is the perfect blend of old-school R&B; and hip hop.Joy Denalane is a star in Germany, but you wouldn't know it with the way her American-style vocal cuts through the album's hip hop-based beats (produced by No I.D. and Jake One) and Stax-influenced tracks. Vocally, she's on the light-side of Mary J Blige (whom she even dedicates the song ""7-year itch"" to), with the maturity of Adrianna Evans. But the sound she conveys is totally hers - she's alternative but still very accessible, which makes her lack of success in the US (outside a spotlight on Okayplayer) puzzling. Sometimes personal (like on the autobiographical title track), sometimes catering to radio (""Let Go"") and sometimes catering to hip hop/R&B; dieharders (""One in a Million"" and ""For the Love""), Denalane's ""Born and Raised"" is the type of music Erykah Badu would be making if she weren't taking herself so damn serious, or music that Amy Winehouse could potentially make if she wasn't so messed up."
4,STRONG,LOVED THIS CD! STRONG TRACKS (WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS) SHE DELIVERS ALOT TO ENJOY FROM CHANGE TO THE TITLE TRACK. LOVE SOWETO'S ENERGY AND HER ODE TO A CHILDHOOD LOVE OF MINE MS MARY J. (STILL LOVE HER BUT TO BE 16ISH WHEN MY LIFE DROPPED WAS LIKE AIR)JOY IS A JOY! OBAMA SHOULD USED HER SONG CHANGE AS HIS CAMPAIGN TRACK!
3,An easy read,"I was assigned this book for one of my university classes. At first i was very puzzled by the some-what conversational style of writing these authors used. Like with many of the other comments on this book, it has a staunch American view of the international system. Perhaps though this book is more important than many of the other commenters realized. In understanding international relations critical thinking is an imperative. From this less than objective book many american students with extensive knowledge about world history and affairs will quickly understand this prism of understanding is perhaps what many citizens as well as policy makers think is actually true (scary thought). To totally understand IR this is just one stepping stone in understanding different points of view. This book should be taken with a critical eye and motivation to further study the subject of international relations."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK!,"This is one of the worst books for international relations. I knew a lot about history before reading the chapters in the book on recent foreign policy and what this book was teaching is far from accurate history. If anything reading this book was detrimental to my understanding of the world. If you are a professor considering using this book-DO NOT! I spent so much time in my class getting angry with this text, and it taught me nothing."
1,Starts off well but quickly deteriorates.,"The opening chapters do give a reasonable introduction to the subject of International relations and there is a fairly objective account of the Vietnam War in Chapter 3, however as the book moves on to present day issues such as global terrorism and the emergence of economic blocs in the pacific and Europe you cannot help but notice an overwhelming pro-American bias. I agree with a previous reviewers comment that the subject of international relations depends on an impartial and evenhanded approach and I feel that this book fails in this respect.Perhaps the 7th edition addresses some of the more overt opinions stated in the book, I personally would not recommend it to any teacher or student thinking of using it to teach political science or International relations."
1,Completely Biased,"I had this assigned for a course, and the text reeks of conservative views and values. It is very casually written and goes to extreme points of ethically attacking people and states. Unbelievable."
4,IR,Never had an IR class before and while the class was an accelerated course the book was essential in my learning so much about worl issues I wasn't aware of or didn't have clear details on. An easy read and helpful tidbits imbedded in the reading.
5,As would be expected,"There were some stickers stating the book was used, no tears or highlighting so the book was in great condition."
2,Yawn!!,"I've you like old school metal music?, you may like this? Theirs certainly nothing earth shattering here, just classic 80's style metal in abundance. The songs are ok at best, but again nothing really spectacular. I Like metal music melodic and heavy and I like singers who can actually sing. The guys who just bark or growl out the lyrics do absolutely nothing for me. Both my favourites styles are somewhat represented here as it's heavy to a point and it's melodic. I find the singers delivery to be way over the top most of the time? and the music is just ok. To be honest this cd set did absolutely nothing for me. I just found it to be lacked truly good songs. Yes it has moments here and there, but not near enough of the them I'm afraid. It's a disappointment my books.The sound quality is decent and so is the jackets as it contains lyrics and so on.In conclusion, it's an ok listen, but nothing exceptional. I really can't give it more than 2 stars out of 5 because the songs are just not there!"
4,lounge 99,"in the top period of the lounge this german group was top of the bill. they keep touring ! so: although it is not the dj stuff, it is lounge classic, I am glad it has finally beebn released world wide."
3,"Lots of Accessories, Not a lot of Room","This product has some awesome accessories, which is why we bought it. When I got it and tried it on, however, I noticed it ran pretty small. The dress stretches pretty well, although it still gapes a bit at the snaps. The stockings just have to not be pulled up very high for anyone with curves. However, the completed look was satisfactory and fun."
4,An Inspiring Read,It was very inspiring and enjoyable and is an excellent suggestion to pass on to our daughters. The comparison of the Bible as it pertains to todays woman and world was thought provoking and wonderful and educational.
2,Do not take this camera on vacation,The screen is not visible in sunlight and there isn't a viewfinder so taking outdoor pictures is guess work at best. I would not recommend this camera for the outdoor enthusist or frequent traveler.
4,Olympus Stylus 750,"The only bad feature is no view finder. Taking pics in bright daylight is like taking them in the dark--you just guess the aim. I've actually had great luck with the guessing. Otherwise it is perfect. Small size fits into any pocket, large screen, great software."
4,I'd buy it again,"I've used my 750 for a month now and love it except for one thing. No viewfinder. Most ultra compacts don't have one but in bright sun it's tricky to see the display. I ""reshopped"" today and found a Canon Elph 800si but - it was only 3x optical zoom not 5x, it weighed more, cost $100 more, had fewer features and scenes (which I really use), wasn't weather resistant and was harder to ""figure out"". I decided to keep my 750 and just learn how to shield the display better. It takes great shots and the automatic scenes are easy to use and easy to switch among. Much easier than my old Olympus."
3,sunny,nice digital camera easy features to use only shutter speed is slow overall good for personal use for better speed n more storage need to buy extra memory card atleast 1 GB
4,a little perplexed,"This camera is too complex for my first digital. Actuallyits my first camera since my army days 30 years ago. Its a bit too small, for my large hands and if not for the low price I would have sent it back. I will give it to my good friend and let her deal with it. She has more experience and I can always borrow it from her. Other than my personal problems with the new age techno digital minaturized devices this camera takes very good pictures and if you take the time to figure it out you'll be very pleased. Thank you Richard"
4,Great camera,"This camera was a very decent point and shoot. Great intro camera, and in a cool color too.So cool that it was stolen from me. :'( Oh well."
3,"It's ok, but....","I have had this camera (along with the underwater case) for a 3 years. When I first bought it, I noted that display is pretty much useless in sunlight. Fortunately, this is not a big deal underwater. I did complain to Olympus about this and their response was to put an some anti-glare film, something I had already done with little improvement. Based on their poor response, I decided never it ever buy a olympus product again. And as I have bought 5 cameras in these past 3 years (2 panasonics and 3 canons), Olympus has lost some business. Add in the idiotic xd proprietary camera card, and that kind of some it up as to just how lame a company Olympus is. They care more about short term profits, than long term customer satisfaction. Thus, I would be suprised if I am not the only customer that they have lost for good. Pardon my rant."
3,Careful around salty ocean air?,"While I have had the camera for multiple years as of this writing, it was purchased to take on a multiple week trip through the US (FL to CA), then over to Hawaii, then sail back to San Diego via a Navy aircraft carrier (USS Stinson). Camera faired quite well in all matter of carrying methods, from motorcycle trunks, various pockets, altitudes, cities and weather. However, seems somewhere in the Hawaii-carrier period, one half of the auto opening/closing lens protective cover got stuck in the open position. Other than that, the thing has been spot on and over 2 yrs later still going strong. Go figure. Get a bigger memory card, an extra battery and these little Olympus camera's will take a beating and keep producing on and off the beaten paths."
3,Not so good camera!!!,Did not have the quality I was looking for or the ease in handling. I guess I am a confirmed Fuji person!!!
4,Good all around digital camera.,This is a good camera that you can take anywhere. It is easy to use and easy to download pictures to yourcomputer
4,"Great camera, one common flaw...","This is our 2nd Olympus Digital camera and was well worth the buy. Takes great pictures and is very easy to use. The flaw is the lack of a viewfinder. It is nearly impossible to preview the picture that you are taking in bright daylight, even with a ""anti-reflective"" screen protector in place. This seems to be a growing problem with new point and shoot digitals. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. Nevertheless, it is a great camera with lots of useful, easy to manage settings built in."
5,I love this camera!,"I love this camera so much, I have recommended it to five people who have also bought it! Thanks for the great service, and the great camera!"
2,Olympus Stylus 750,"Battery life is terrible if you use image stabilizer, expect 25-30 shots on a full battery. Also the camera lacks of an optical view finder. Very difficult to shoot in sunlight with LCD. Many shots are somewhat bleached out while using auto white balance. Owned a stylus 400 digital prior to this and it is a dissapointment rather than upgrade. The only upsides are the 5x optical zoom which is a little choppy, and the image stabilizer that kills the battery if left on."
4,New camera,I like all of the features on this camera except the fact it doesn't have a view finder. When taking pictures in bright light you can't see your subject.
4,So many features I haven't discovered them all!,"I think this is a great camera. It takes nice shots and probably even better ones then I have been taking since I have yet to use all of the different modes and features that it comes with. My only real problem with this camera is there isn't a view finder just a screen which is impossible to see if the sunlight hits it. So, you find yourself aiming and shooting and praying you got the shot. Out of direct sun it is great. If they could just add a view finder it would be perfect!"
2,LCD's are only great indoor.,"I bought this camera beginning of this year as the older Olympus 3.2 MP camera was very good. However, this one just frustrates me since you cannot see the image you are taking on the LCD when shooting outdoors. Bought a flap for it and I can see a little bit now but it is still almost shooting blind. Would like to have the viewfinder in my next camera."
2,"There is no ""delete all photos"" feature on this camera!","Two months ago, I bought the Stylus 750 to replace an aging Kodak digital. Unlike the Kodak, the Olympus has no ""delete all phots"" feature, so the only way to delete all the photos from the camera after transfering to the computer is to look at each photo separately on the camera's LCD display, push the delete button on the back of the camera, confirm that I really want to delete it, then it's gone. One photo gone and 235 to go. It takes about 10 minutes to delete every hundred photos (each deletion requires 3 button pushes, one picture at a time). I've now bought a replacement camera (a Canon) that has a ""delete all photos"" option. I never would have guessed that a camera would be sold that made it so hard to delete the photos. It's a flaw that makes the camera functionally so clunky that I'd advise looking to another manufacturer for your digital camera purchase."
2,excellent indoor camera ng for outdoors,Works fine indoors but should have an optical view finder for outdoors!CANNOT SEE IMAGE IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT!!
4,Similar complaints as other reviewers,"The LCD screen is almost impossible to view in certain outdoor circumstances like previously mentioned. I haven't toyed with it long enough to find a solution. I love the fact that it is waterproof. We have the underwater housing for scuba diving but if that ever leaked just a little, the camera would survive (unlike its predecessor). We also handed it (minus the underwater housing) someone standing in the water to take pictures. The smile on my face was from knowing that if the camera was dropped in the water by accident, it wouldn't matter. I also enjoy the size, having brought it into venues where ""no cameras allowed"" is stated but not thoroughly enforced. :)"
3,decent but suffers from standard delayed shooting,"The picture quality is good and the LCD screen is bright.When you think you have the perfect moment and press the button to take the shot, you actually have to wait another second or two before the camera actually takes the shot.It's a fairly commmon issue with a lot of point and shoot digital cameras but it's annoying nonetheless."
5,Outstanding Little Camera,Our other digital camera (panasonic FZ) was stolen and I wanted to get another camera as a replacement. The FZ was way to bulky for me to take out on my job so I wanted something a little smaller but with decent zoom capabilities. The Olympus 750 has hit the mark dead on. With its CCD shift stabililation the shots come out perfect everytime. The zoom works nicely and with the digital zoom you can really get some good shots from far away. The only complaint I have with the camera is that if you are out in sunlight it is very difficult to see the LCD. You just have to point and shoot and hope you got the shot. I have taken pics in the sport mode and have gotten some excellent action shots. The on screen menu is very good. Definately a keeper by a long shot.
3,Olympus Stylus 750,"It has has a view screen that you can not see in sunlight, and I don't mean hard to see, I mean it is black. There is no way you can compose a picture in bright sun. With this camera, you would be just pointing and praying you got the shot you wanted. Tech support suggested a screen protector but that did nothing to improve the view. Battery life is terrible, good thing I purchased a spare. Otherwise this is a great little camera if most of your shots are indoors."
3,Could be a great camera,"I was so excited about this camera. Had all the features I wanted at a great price. I did not believe the reviews about the screen could be right. Boy was I wrong. What good is a camera with great features and that will take great picture, but has a view screen that you can not see in sunlight? And I don't mean it is hard to see, I mean it is black. There is no way you can compose a picture in bight sun. I wanted this camera to take on a trip and figured I would be outside and in the sun-- with this camera, you would be just pointing and praying you got the shot you wanted. I returned it!"
4,Overall a great product,"Very cool. I was really excited about the great zoom lens. Although, a bit upset to find that I overlooked the lack of a viewfinder. It is very difficult to take pictures outside in the sun with only the LCD screen. The camera is light weight. I thought the color was a bit off, it is more yellowish than lime green. I am pleased with the quality of pictures I am getting. Would have been cool if it came with a camera case."
1,Can NOT Be Used in Sunlight,Indoors it's fine but for outdoors there is no view finder. YOU CAN'T SEE ANY IMAGE ON THE VEIWING SCREEN IN SUNLIGHT!!
4,Nice Camera,"Very convenient for it's size, easily stored and brought anywhere.Has a good number of features, haven't had it long enough to explore all of them or experiment just yet. Looks promising though to play with.The ""auto"" setting does make bright photos as a default. Will have to adjust accordingly.It's necessary to get a memory card to be able to have enough room for pictures. The camera's memory fills far too quickly."
1,Order and shipment,This has been a very bad experience. No camera and no word. I bought another camera through amazon from another seller and unable to cancel this order. Thank you amazon for allowing cancel after 30 days............ROD Bigelow
1,I hate this thing!,I hate this camera. I have had it for a while and the flash is so bright you have about 6 inches you have to stand in like 20 feet away so the flash isn't too bright. The autofocus hasn't been working for me. The exposure setting has been making no difference in the exposure of my photos on manual mode. I seriously hate this camera.
1,disappointing,SAve your money. This camera is very disapointing and i do not recommend it for purchase. I have had 35 mm olympus and loved it but this is not up to their standards. You can may inside pictures that turn out fairly well but it is usless outside. The nice big viewing area on the back just goes completly black even in low light outdoors so you cannot see what you are shooting. I will be replacing this camera as soon as possible.
2,Olympus doesn't honor their warranty,"The camera broke shortly after we purchased it. When we sent it in for repair we were told that our warranty was void because the camera had been dropped. The camera had not been dropped! So, not only was this camera a waste of money, so was the extended warranty because once Olympus voided the manufacturer's warranty the other was no good either. What a waste of money!"
4,sceneries work!,"I've using it for half a year now. I bought it because I had a m300 for 5 years and it still works fine. I just wanted more pixels.This thing did not disappoint me and with its 5* optical zoom I'm truly satisfied. Also some of the sceneries (documents, cuisine) have been useful for a non-professional like me.The only thing I hate about it is the sound it makes when you're holding it. It sounds like it's gonna take a shot, but it makes me feel its gonna die."
2,Great Dissapointment,"I loved this camera for its size and features. Used it for a year now. Takes some great pictures but indoors night pictures with lights was terrible most of the time, anti-shake doe snot work that well. Now 13 months later this camera stopped working. When I turn on the camera, the lens comes out all the way and no display appears on the LCD, the LED light flickers and lens goes back in 3/4th of the way. I called Olympus support and they charge $140/- to fix it. Better to buy a new camera. Some of the pictures had this weird droplets of color that messed up great shots. Watch out, if you buy this camera make sure you get extended warranty."
5,I like it!,This my first digital camara and I looked around and questioned others about their camara. This camara seemed to have what I wanted and I am very satisfied with it. In fact after using mine my boyfriend also bought one.
4,An antidote to winter or a good summer read.,"This humorous, entertaining comedy of manners set me off on a search for all of Elizabeth Palmer's novels when I was looking for a break from heavier fare. The dysfunctional relationships which drive her plots are leavened with enough humor and literary allusions to raise Ms. Palmer's writing above the ordinary. Best analogy? A lighter Fay Weldon."
5,One of the greatest contemporary writers of Europe.,This is the one of the best books of Madsen. It is indeed a mystery that his books haven't made it to the world public. The setting and plot of this novel can't fail to amaze and entertain the reader. Truly an unforgettable experience.
3,Pope Factory - self-titled (Buffalo Fire Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Good, decent release by the four piece 'alternative pop' Toronto band. CD comes in a flat matchbook-like holder. Never seen one quite like this before. Tracks that make me want to hang onto this disc are the psychedelic pop-ish ""Channeling Ringo"", ""Smug"" and the soaring ten-minute ""The Wait"" {best cut this CD has to offer}. Personnel: Scott Warren-guitar & vocals, Peter Muha-bass, keyboards & vocals, Matt Hollingshead-lead guitar and Andre Skinner-drums. Could do a lot for fans of Olivia Tremor Control, Apples In Stereo and {it's a long shot} maybe Asteriod #4."
4,"My money is on these guys as ""the next big thing""","A friend recommended this cd and I absolutely love it! Totally refreshing and not like the cookie cutter ""alternative"" that you hear everywhere these days. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Reference and Tutorial Book,"I like this book for the simple fact of all of the great information packed in it, It has tables of ports, trojans, viruses, it even comes with a cd of all the tools he talks about on the book. I just think this book is great! I have used it to track down someone who has been stealing my ISP password through a trojan."
4,Good Overview,It provided a well rounded description of Network security and offered some good advice and tools.
1,"Very poorly written, much redundant information",This book is poorly written with alot of redundancy and useless information. I had to skim through alot of chaff to find any of the even remotely useful information contained within.
4,Absolutely Unique Approach,"I have never seen, heard, learned, used and played with such a product. It could let you dig down very deep, however, you would never realize how deep you come down. I bought it because I thought I would learn what does typical hacker does. Now, I want to be a hacker and say hello to my friends company's intranet."
1,"NO, NO, NO ! ! !","Dated, boring, with a lot of repetitions, and full of almost useless information.If you are really interested in 'Hack Attacks Revealed' then try the very recent 'Hack Proofing Your Network (2nd Edition)', quite up to date and comprehensive."
5,great book,"The author does a great job of taking complicated material and maiking it easy to follow for advanced, and not-so-advanced readers."
3,Good Beginning,"This book is a good introduction to network security, even the more experienced should be able to pick up a trick or two. Worth the money!"
4,Hack Attacks Review,"I like the information & how it was presented in the book. I am looking forward to trying the new software upgrade, as I had problems with the last version."
4,Get on top in just days.,"Learn how to program your own security test code, and find your own security breaches in just days… This book is a breakthrough for your own analysis program to find those weak points! And introducing Tiger suite, the COMPLETE online set of tools, in just days you’ll see measurable results in your own method. BONUS: But not to worry, to insure your success the guys at support will work with you every step of the way."
5,Top material,"This book is TOP material: I also like comparing the source code with hacks, I found the port numbers and services to be very handy and valuable in my work and the book is a great resource you must have as an engineer. The book was recommended to me by several people and I too will do the same for you."
3,Good Book - but not quite what I 've expected,"This is a strange book to review. I'd give a 50% recommendation mostly because some chapters (perhaps half the book) could have been stripped with no real loss.There are some good ones, in the beginning and at the very end, but the ones in the middle simply reprint names and usage of trojan/worm/virus kit software found on the net. Besides not being a complete list is useless since needs to be updated in a daily bases.The good chapters explain you a lot of the protocols and how they interact, common techniques used by intruders.If you do not have any other security/tcp-ip related book you should buy this since it's a good start. If you already have others you can safely skip this one."
2,Not all that useful for security professionals,"If you are a security professional, then this book is not for you. Its content is too scattered."
4,a good reference,i recently bought this book and i recommend it as a reference for those of you who's looking for a reference book ...its worthy !
5,Nothing less than excellence!,"This book is confrontational, challenging, technologically thorough and the CD is one of the better mixtures security stuff. I usually never post reviews unless I come across something high quality. I feel a little cheated that I now have to buy Hack Attacks Denied to see all the countermeasures. No! I take that back, the book would have been too big and therefore they would have cut too much I fear. But for the money I hope book2 is comparable. Regardless book1 is nothing less than excellence."
2,Padded to the brim with irrelevant information,"I'm afraid I can't recommend this book, being one of the least useful and most poorly written ""security"" books I've seen. It is padded out with so many pages of useless programming listings and voluminous other unnecessary tables, screendumps and incorrect information it is embarrassing. Take for example an entire chapter devoted to the ""C"" programming language that goes into detail describing MS-DOS 16-bit pointer types and how to write a DOS TSR program. This was obviously culled from some programming reference from the mid 80s. How relevant is this to security in this day and age? How relevant is this particular chapter even to *programming* in this day and age? Answer: none. And I'm afraid the same goes for the bulk of the book. This is security for twinkies!"
2,You probably don't want to buy this book.,"The title ""Hack Attacks Revealed"" suggests a list of real life hacks and with an explanation how they were done. That's not what the book is about. John Chirillo spends 76 pages on networking, 41 pages on vendor codes in MAC addresses, 38 pages on port numbers, 38 pages on DOS commands. You can see how he can fill 944 pages without needing to go deep into the subject.If you don't know anything about networking and security and you would like to learn about it and you think hacking is ""cool"", well, then this would be an exciting book for you."
4,4/5 stars and a thumbs up,"I've read all the reviews posted here and thought I would join in too. What can I say about this book? Well it starts out a little dry but certainly picks up the beat after the internetworking tutorials. I particularly like the style the author used and the way each topic intertwined with more serious security technologies later on. Although I found some errors, the overall material was organized well and explained in great detail. A picture says a thousand words, and that's what I like most about the many examples (the author doesn't spare any expense with this book's illustrations). I consider myself well read when it comes to this topic, and this book opened the door to many new interesting methods. 4/5 stars and a thumbs up."
4,Any *Serious* beginner has to have this book.,"The first chapters of John's book represent an incredible TCP/IP primer, and *the* 'networking essentials' for someone new to the game. I found the conversion tables and *glossary* of commands in chapter 6 to be quite useful as a reference. Additionally, there is a generous amount of code provided to aid novice programmers, however, someone who has never been exposed to C would find it difficult to get a firm grasp (read: logic) on the language using just this book.The information in the appendices, although accessible with a google-search on the internet, are informative *and* you don't have to search them :-oAll in all, the material is pretty outdated, but a solid resource for someone just breaking into network security or hacking. If your stoked about what you read here and understand the concepts, then you may have found your niche. Keep reading!"
4,A Great Intro to the subject,"If you're new to this area, this a great place to start. I'd recommend this book along with Hacking Exposed. It pretty much covers all sub-categories of modern day hacking and will sit well as a reference on your bookshelf."
1,Flows like molasis,"This book has some serious organizational issues. It reads like a succession of small essays with nothing holding them together. 'Essays' is a strong word, perhaps 'thoughts' is better. No, better yet, 'outbursts' - they read like quick definitive ideas on a matter without anything backing them up, running in one door and out the other without really proving the point. Until the second half, where it's nothing but undiscussed C code."
1,Good thing it was 40% off,"Wow, what a dated conglomeration of material. I can't tell if it is meant for beginners or security experts. The basics aren't explained simply enough for a layman, and the experienced engineer already knows the basics--like how many bits in different classes of IP addresses. Secondly, most people who are going to buy this are network security experts, so why the pages and pages of C code and other basics like port numbers, etc? What a waste of time."
1,Takes too much to say too little,"I really don't understand this book.The author takes too much time to say too little discerning information.Go with other books, this simply is too expensive and of too little value."
4,Excellent and Informative,The book provided excellent information on computer systems security. This invaluable information will help me with my consulting practice.
4,A great insight into hacking attacks,This book is very well written with chapters introducing the technology behind the internet and how hackers use its weakness to gain access to private systems. Because of this the book appeals to users of all experience levels. Overall a good read to learn what attacks hackers are using and the means in which to protect against them.
1,Spread like Wildfire? Don't think so.,"I've heard a lot of cliche's about this book, but the one that I found the most amusing is that it would 'spread like wildfire.' Well, weighing in at over 1300 pages, the first two Hack Attack books certainly could be used as excellent kindling. And this is the best use of these books. You will feel no remorse should you burn each and every page of these wretched books on a cold cold night. Have no pangs of guilt, there's nothing useful in these books at all. Don't be fooled by the thickness, it's very light on content, and heavy on screen shots and source code listings. You can find better references in one fifth the page count."
2,Slightly disapointed,"This book is an excellent reference for networking / protocols etc, with a few scant comments of how these protocols are vulnerable. Most of the info in the appendixes can be found in RFC's and has been pulled straight out. The extensive list of port references as an example. The tiger tool kit looked promising for the out of the box hacker but I was suprised to see that there was only a limited edition (limited by functionality) included. Some interesting scripts and a different approach than other books I have read which was nice. Made me brush up on the network stuff but nothing you cant learn from a good tcp/ip book. All in all interesting, well written but it seems the only way you are ever going to hack anything is to build your own lab and learn it yourself."
3,Good Primer,"Hack Attacks revealed is a good starting point to understand the tools , methods and processes hackers use to attempt to penetrate networks. I would have liked to have seen more details on the descriptions of the attacks. I've just begun using TigerSuite to probe around on my network, but have to found of few of the tools to be quite useful already."
2,Read The Reviews,"Read the reviews and understand what you're buying before you pay [price] of your hard earned money for this book.Go to a bookstore and take a minute to thumb through the pages to see what's in it. And the cd in the back of the book? Forget it - it's an eval. copy. You get a few programs that work 'out of the box' but in order to use the cd in it's entirety you have to pay an additional $5.00 at a website in order to activate the 'pro' version - LAME.I wanted so much for this book to be what it advertised. I held out hope reading page after (fluff)page. I held out hope even after reading other reviews that trashed this book. I held out hope until I popped the cd into my computer and saw that the only thing John Chirillo revealed to me was that I wasted my time and money.If you take away only one thing in this review, take this:There are no shortcuts. Buy ""Hacking Exposed"", sit down in front of the computer, and do your homework. Good Luck"
1,Diabled.,"....I bought this book for the 'Custom Hacking Toolkit' which is in the CD on the back. Turns out that this 'custom' toolkit is little more than windows (yes, windows!) program that helps run other security auditing tools that were written by other folks. Most of the features are disabled until you buy an upgrade from the website. Until then you have a pretty menuing system that won't do anything...."
1,worse than advertized,"my friends told me not to buy this and i ignored them. i should have listened. this book would have been groundbreaking eight years ago, but its worthless in the 21st century. too outdated."
1,"too long, too wrong.","This book was too long, and contained too many completely wrong 'facts' and analysis, to be usable by anyone actually into hacking or the security field..."
4,Fantastic Reference,"This is a fantastic security reference. I have finished this book and now half way through the next. This material is what I was looking for, something to really explain the hottest topic in computing and give diagrams, tricks, software and source code to get going. If you're looking for an all in one book on the topic, try this one!"
4,A very good learning reference,The tutorials are very good! I learned more about TCPIP in this book than from four others combined. For me the security hacking secrets were just an added bonus. Great job to Chirillo and John Wiley & Sons.
4,Hack Attacks is Excellent!,"As a complete tyro to the world of computer security, I was pleased to find a book that could explain everything in detail from start to finish. The Cd-rom included with the book only makes it that much more of a great bargain."
4,It will always be a book that you will go back to time and t,"It was good to see another book on the market that someone has taken a lot of time searching the net for the latest information for the IT/Fraud/Security managers of the world.The book goes into a lot of detail about the different risks involved in the IT security industry, if you are new to the industry then this is a must, don't be disappointed about this book, it will always be a book that you will go back to time and time again."
1,There are better references,"Undeniably one of the worst technical books I have ever had the misfortune to read. It is sort of a combination of networking protocalls, coding, server info, and lists of commands. Each of these areas is very separate from each other in reality. The novice user will be unable to use it because he will not understand it; and the pro will not want to read 900 pages of items he mostly already knows. What we're missing here is technique and explanation. I'm not sure what someone would use this book for. I already have reference books for most of these areas, so don't buy this if you are really looking for techniques on how a real hacker does things."
5,GREAT kids book,This is a great kid's book full of laughs for kids and adults! The illustrations are great and very different from other children's books. Definitely buy this book!
5,Hmmm...Skin-head gang = aliens?,"This book is so awesome, words cannot describe this. I read it when I was in sixth grade and it was so intresting. I read it every study hall at the end of the day for 5 months! I could not put it down! Here is basically what it is about:A loser named Quentin starts a Skin-Head gang where they are all goth and have to get certain tatooes and piercings. Soon Matt, Luke's younger brother becomes adapted and a member of the Skin-Head gang. Soon after that, Quentin, an unknown alien/extratrestrial gets mind control of Luke and Mandy, and they always disappear betweeen 10 pm and 2 am. But when they come back, they do not remember a thing. They soon talk it over and things start adding up. Quentin spyes on them in a library and everything goes wacky...trust me it is not a playful alien book...it is realistic, and probably for ages 14+...i mean it it is so awesome...get it now. Cheers to Rodman Philbrick!"
3,Too ofuscated,This book presents the method of Analytic Network Process for decision making. This book is the reference book of the ANP but it is a pity that it is written without thinking about the reader. The book has some math in it but what makes it difficult to read is trying to find the topic structuring through the text the author chose to explain those concepts. You have to read and re-read it before grasping the method.As someone said this book is useful for validating your own implementation of the method since it has lots and lots of tables in it without helping much to the topic understanding. I better recommend to follow the book by reading this tutorial(...) . It will best settle ideas.
3,"Thomas Saaty, Theory and Apps of the Analytic Network Process..","For the price, this is a pretty descent pseudo textbook and reference guide for setting up an Analytical Hierarchy, especially in cases with more than just a few criteria or factors to be considered. I bought it for a project at work where I thought the Analytic Hierarchy Process was a potential research methodology I wanted to use. The book came in handy as a reference in helping me set up matrices for pair-wise comparisons and to check for consistency."
4,I only wish it was longer,"Perfectionist Edouard Gillet has angered King Phillip so hedecides to lay low for a while in Scotland. He takes his young sonwith him who needs a mother figure to teach him the more genteel facets of life. Anne is for from perfect and she has a son many would view as 'the son of the devil' because he is deaf. Through a series of events they are married and fall in love, with Edouard admitting his love early and Anne holding off because she hasn't told him her son is deaf. Its nice to read a story where the hero and heroine are not the usual young and naive. Anne is in her late 20's and Edwouard is a little older. Of course both have their secrets and each is hurt when they discover that the other has been holding back on the other."
2,Unlucky 13.net,"When I first heard about this Film Roman-backed series, I was very excited. The discs, however, have not lived up to their potential, and ""Weird and Mysterious"" is no exception. As with the other Level13.net anthologies, the majority of pieces included on this disc are too short, too rough and too amatuer. Clearly there is promise in some of these future filmmakers (""Headdress"" is actually a lovely and stirring little piece), but if you're looking for an anthology of more polished, more professional animation, you'll need to look at the Animation Show Volume One or any of the NFB Canadian Animation collections."
5,Durable and holding strong,"I bought one of these for trolling in Lake Superior in Minnesota (largest freshwater lake in the world). Even in the summertime the water stays at a temperature that can cause hypothermia if you fall into it, so needless to say, it's very cold water all the time. After losing a plain weight (not coated) the last time out, I picked up one of these Cannon vinyl coated weights with the reflective sticker to try out. So far after several trips out it's holding up great, even in the constant freezing waters. The reflective sticker hasn't started to peel as of yet, and the vinyl coating works well for not scraping up the side of the boat. It's my new favorite weight and I'm even picking up a few more. I like this one enough I want to be sure to have a few on hand!"
1,Old black and white title,"While this is Sinister Video's favorite film, it won't be yours. This is a really old, black and white film from 1963. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and most things regarding this film are, in a word, bad."
2,As older B movies go this is it.........,Its so memerable I dont remember it. The plot is a little off. The time required to make this movie was wasted.
1,not good,"I am not sure why this had such great reviews, it was as bad as they can get! I love the vintage stuff but this was the worst of the worst."
1,Awful,Can't remember why I rented this but it really is a disjointed terrible movie. Not scary or interesting at all.
2,Wikky...Wikky...Blech!,"All I wanted to do was remix and create songs for my own personal enjoyment. Well, this didn't cut it. Not only is it SO VERY NOT USER FRIENDLY, (You'll have to read the manual three times over) but it, often freezes up, and takes alot of memory (and you still have to keep the CD-rom in the drive when you start it.) It comes with two discs, I didn't even get to the second one. After spending a good amount of time remixing one of my favorite tunes, I found that I was unable to save the mix in any kind of useful format. Can't exchange the tune, and can't burn it to a CD. I often thought how much easier it would be to have a double casette deck. It was a thrifty purchase, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Good Release,Well the description was the one with the strap but i got the one with the solid post. So I gave this 3 stars since the product is still good just not what i thought it was going to be
1,Save your money,No matter what we did these cartridges were not recognized by the printer. These (I bought two) are going back to Amazon and I'm off to Office Depot for quality replacements.
3,okay product...,"Packaging is very good. When I first insert I get error from printer stating not able to detect toner. Re-insert couple of times and same thing happens. After 15 minutes to checking/comparing my original Canon toner and found out that there is a metal pin is not touching the sensor. Once use some force to pile out the metal part so it can touch the sensor, the printer detects the toner. Toner is working good."
1,Printer did not recognize new cartridge,"I purchased this cartridge because it said that it would be compatible with my printer. When I inserted it, my printer didn't recognize it and wouldn't work. I was trying to save money and I guess you get what you pay for. I do have to say that the company was very honest though, when I called them they said that does happen sometimes and they would gladly return it or send me another one. I chose to return the item and get my money back. The money was back in my bank account within a few days."
1,Poor quality and disabled the fax,"I read the other reviews of this product and due to the low price decided to take a chance. The printer did not recognize that the cartridge was new and full of ink but still carried on working. Printing was fine but the fax stopped working, something I didn't realize at the time and has caused me much hassle. Print quality was OK however. I decided to buy the original cartridge and lo and behold my fax is now working. I should have known better from the reviews already here and have now paid for it."
2,X25 Compatible Toner,"I have purchased several replacement toner cartridges for my printer that have all worked as advertised, but this particular cartridge adds a 1/4"" black line (or two) every eight pages. That works out to a 12% waste of paper."
4,Well done,"THe product order was quick and I received with the time frame they mentioned earlier , its been a good expirience with this seller"
1,"Poor quality, out of toner, inconvinient return with return shipping fee","Very disappointed. The toner I ordered is out of toner, the printer cannot work after installing it. I applied to return so many times, asking different ways but the response is so so so slow and no efficiency! AND finally, I can return but the system charge my return shipping fee even! The return is not my fault at all! I won't buy the related product any more"
1,Poor quality product.,"I used it for less than two month. The ink is used out and the cartridge is broken. So dispointed. Comparing to some other X25 cartridge (not OEM also) I bought before, it is too bad."
1,Do not work at all!!,"i bought 2 of this, and none of them work in my printer. so angry about that.im pretty sure the toners have been used and added powder afterward, bcuz one of them already broken when i opened it.saving money became totally wasted money!!"
3,It's Ok,"What more can I say it arrived, and when I start using it I can grade it, until then all I can say is it arrived in one piece. The price was the best I could find on the net, that should help the adventurous to decide."
1,did not solve the problem,"installed this one instead of a generic one that ran out of ink, my printer still show that I'm out of toner, probably will never order this brand again."
3,Just ok,"Product works fine, but.....something in the cartridge is off and the out of toner signal will not shut off. found some paper (tags) stuck to it where there is none on the OEM. removed it but still the signal. Looking for the sensor on the printer and will eventually find it and fix the issue. An annoyance I should not have to go through, but the price is right. Being able to buy four for the price of one."
2,Worked for a while,"I bought it in January for my Canon imageClass MF3110 which is used lightly. It worked great initially! But today I start to hear high-pitch noise when printing, and the printout has lots of black stains. I was able to get rid of the black stains by wiggling the cartrage a little, but I was not able to get rid of the noise yet. Maybe if I try longer, I could find a sweet spot to get rid of the noise. I am just a little concerned that this may wear out my printer faster!I re-installed my original Canon X25 Cartridge and it works fine.Can not return the cartrage since the return window just expired (Feb 27).Based on this experience, I can not recommend this product. I will probably buy a Canon cartrage next time."
2,Printer would not recognize cartridge,"My ratings on print quality, etc. do not really apply because I was never able to print a thing. Despite the fact that this WAS the correctly specified cartridge for my Canon MF5770, the printer would only dispay a message saying, ""Install Cartridge"". Super Media Store customer service advised me to leave the cartridge in the machine for several hours. Seemed like a waste of time and it was. Worst of all, I was completely unable to get ANYONE at Super Media to again answer the phone despite up to 8 calls on 3 different days! We all recognize that a defective item will occur from time to time, but the total lack of availability to handle customer service has been extremely disappointing."
1,This cartridge causes jam for my MF3240 printer!!!,"I bought one such cartridge last year, and the printer jammed all the time. So I sent my printer to Canon service department (still under warranty at that time). After two weeks, they told me it was the cartridge problem, which caused the jam. I didn't believe that. Then my lab mate bought another one from this store. It still didn't work!!! Lots of jam and ink leaks... This compatible one is really not compatible with Canon ImageClass MF 3240!!! As the printer has been left unused several months, and the it still jams now. I don't know I can change the cartridge or not. But what I've realized is that the cartridge caused the jam problem!"
2,It works - kinda,"It does fit in my Canon MF 3240 but the ""Out of Toner"" error light has remained on ever since the change. Inkers sends an explanation letter with the cartridges to cover themselves from the obvious complaints that would arise from these ""compatible"" cartridges. They even have a section of the letter to cover why toner printing is light or uneven and one for lines, spots or splotches. I've followed the directions on those and still have the same issues. I guess I got what I paid for and I'll be back to paying full price for the canon toner cartridges after this experiment."
3,X25 Compatible...?,"I works with my Canon laser printer, however the left side of the paper has black smudges along the edge. Don't know if this particular one is faulty or if all of them are a little faulty. Like most replacement cartridges that aren't name brand this one falls short."
5,Works great,"This X25 Toner is realy working great, I would certainly recommend it for others. Price is lmuch ess than other brands"
5,Works wells,Inexpensive but not cheap. The toner works well and seems to have the yield advertised. I would recommend for someone looking for inexpensive toner.
1,do not order from them.,ordered four ink cartridges. two did not work at all and one was wrong one to begin with. do not order. total waste of money
2,opened package,"Shipping was quick and well packaged, but the gasket package was opened with the distributor gasket missing. I had a spare from a prior job so I got by with out it. When it says new it should be all there and new"
1,deceptive,"The image provided indicates a form-fitting headrest cover. This is NOT the case--covers are a simple cap style, and must be cut to provide an opening for the face! I would never have purchased this item had I known this; the image is highly, and I presume intentionally, deceptive."
5,The best snack ever!,"I have always loved Cadbury chocolates from childhood. When I found these Fingers in high school from a store called 5 Continents, I became obsessed!Years passed and the store eventually stopped carrying it, but I always used to check back, even though I moved 20+ miles away. When I found these on Amazon I was thrilled! I ordered them and was very happy with the product packaging and freshness. As I write this, it's January on the east coast, so I am not worried about receiving a chocolate brick in the mail as of yet.So all in all, I am extremely happy with my fingers!"
1,real estate book,"Took forever to get, at least 3 weeks. Very disappointed in the shipping of it. Althpugh, the packaging was good."
5,Brilliance!,A most excellent read. Sandra Meek's gift of language will lead you on an emotional roller coaster. Her words will truly reach the depths of your soul. Nomadic Foundations is an outstanding work and one of her best. I give it my highest recommendation.
4,Nice mini phone,I really enjoy this handy gadget. The only thing is I lost the manual. Can anyone help me. I want to change the ring tones.
1,Only lasted 3 days.,Sensor worked great for 3 days after install. Then yesterday morning it threw a code for the same sensor I just replaced. Very disappointed in Bosch.
4,Warts and all candor,"Told from the admittedly biased viewpoint of one who was in the trenches, this is a must read for anyone interested in reform in the public schools. There is intrigue, dirty dealing, ethnic conflict, blackmail, and politics, but this is also a story of consensus building, teamwork, hard learned lessons, and working across party lines. Discussing past struggles and the struggle ahead, the book offers both encouragement and warning."
1,Self-serving Indulgence,"Poorly written, full of self-serving indulgence. No one outside of the Houston area could begin to comprehend what this book is about. The first half reads like a diary and the second half contains no new ideas on how to save our public schools....unless you live in Houston. Talk about backdoor politics! I feel sorry for the folks in Houston."
4,Well Built Footrest For Guitarists,"This footrest for guitarists made by König & Meyer in Germany is quite well built and sturdy. It is adjustable through a range of heights and most any player will easily find a comfortable position. (I prefer it relatively low.) I considered giving this footrest five stars, but settled on four because of one minor design issue. The footrest itself is perfectly wide and is comfortable for just about any imaginable kind of footwear (or lack thereof,) however the legs could be just a bit wider as it tends to tip over on its side particularly when adjusted higher or on carpet. Like I mentioned, I keep mine in the lowest two positions, so it's not a major issue for me though it could prove annoying to others depending on their setup. I am happy with my purchase."
3,A little small,This is very well built but it's a little small and I would like it to be able to be used at more of an angle. Even for a small sizes pretty stable.
4,Excellent tutorial (notation difficult to follow at times),"Overall, this is an excellent introduction to the multigrid method, providing the essential background in iterative relaxation methods in order to understand why the multigrid method works. My only complaint is that the notation used in the description of the algorithm is a little hard to follow, and it took some careful rereading to really understand how the algorithm really worked (recursive application of restriction to the error term of the error term of the error term, etc.) in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the fine grid error. Once you get that, you're golden. The multigrid algorithm itself is so simple its silly. Of course, applying it to non-example problems becomes more challenging ;)"
5,Ultimate Guide to Backyard Bug,"Another winner by Dr. Whitney Cranshaw. Excellent reference text for the office, laboratory, or library. Full of color photos and useful diagnostic and life history information. A worthy purchase."
5,Beautiful book,"I had to get this book for a Master Gardener program I enrolled in and found it to be an amazing book. It is beautifully photographed and well written, and extremely informative. Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their knowledge in gardening."
5,Garden Insects of North America : The Ultimate Guide to Backyard Bugs (Princeton Field Guides),Excellent response
2,disappointed,"I bought this book based on the numerous glowing reviews it has received. I was sure I was going to love it and find it very useful. I have an organic yard and attracting insects is one of my goals, so I have a fair sampling of insects that I want to identify. The pictures in this book are plentiful, but they are too small, and too blurry, and shot at weird angles so you can't see all the markings, and shot in natural light so you can't really see some of the defining features. If I didn't already know what some of the insects were, I might not be able to recognize them from the photos in the book. So, the book isn't going to help me with a quick identification of the things I'm seeing in my yard. Perhaps if you are a bug expert, this would be a good book, but it isn't what I was hoping for."
4,insect book,"If you are into gardening like I am, this is an excellent, colorful resource! It will help identify those interesting little bugs in your gardens. I only wish it had a section of natural preventions/controls to go along with each insect."
5,Wonderful Book for Any Gardener!,"This book is truly amazing, and seems to be a very comprenehsive reference. I am still a 'budding' gardener, and all-too-often, I find myself in need of identifying a garden pest so that I can eradicate it properly.What I love most about this book is that it has pictures of so many different types of the same bug, as well as the different life stages of the bus (for example, it has over 68 different pictures of numerous types of aphids, the different stages, and what the infected plant's symptoms may show). Additionally, the pictures are clearly labeled!I'm thrilled with this book, and I'm sure I will use it for many, many years to come!"
3,Great Dancing/Poor Video Quality,"Watch these wonderfully talented dancers and choreographers perform in three pieces. Zizi is exquisite. The dvd is exiting to watch. However,the video quality is somewhat poor whether due to the original filming, deteriation, or the transfer to dvd - I don't know. It is still worth viewing. I would have bought it anyway for the love of ballet, and the chance to see these people dance."
5,Snap this Up !,"I have always thought that ""Town and Country Blues"" was the most perfect Pop song ever written and I still think that.This is such a feel good recording!If you are feeling a little blue,put that song on andas soon as you hear the first track you'll be feeling a happy head dance and your feet get ta tappin' with thestrong sweet voice of Kevin Jamieson and the ever present swift guitar licks and horns.Grab their other Cds as well! You will not be disappointed!Featuring members of DEEP SEASON (another amazing recording ""Island Monkey's"") and The Sundays.Oh how I miss this band!"
5,"If You Don't Have This, YOU'RE MISSING OUT","If you want to give your food that extra ""bang !"", then you have to own this. It will make any recipe with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate will make it much more tastier. For those who use box brownies, etc., this will definitely make them taste less of store bought quality and more homemade. So, get it. It's worth it."
3,Chocolate Extract,Not sure this particular brand of chocolate extract was as chocolaty as other brands that I have tried. Can't really tell that it has been added to my recipe so will go back to using a different product. A bit too subtle in taste. Possibly overpriced given there wasn't much flavor.
1,Horrible semi-sweet junk,"The bottle they sent me was not was not as pictured. It came poorly packaged and there was leakage from a loose top. It was not like any chocolate extract I had ever used. It had a bad, really bad semi-sweet yet weak chocolate flavor. I wound up tossing it. I wanted unsweetened chocolate extract."
5,"Yes, yes, yes!","Now and then a compilation of different artists hits the jackpot- this one is a winner. Many CDs with Greek music are disappointing because they have one sing-along bouzouki cut after another. This CD has wonderfully soulful, melodic Greek music, featuring a wide range of excellent artists with different instruments and rhythms. Buy it!"
5,My Greek Students LOVE IT! (So do I.) Polee' Kala',"I'm teaching Greek at an elementary school, and play this disc for the students while they take notes, etc. We all love it! Back at home, my own kids spin this disc nearly every day. Very relaxing, uplifting and romantic. Putamayo does a great job with these compilations. Efharistoh!"
2,There are greater artists in Greece than ...,Kind of disappointed.There are greater artists in Greece to represent the Greek music.Even the songs from two of the most famous ones included in this disc are not their best songs.
5,The perfect size for me.,"I use this for product labels for my business. The size is perfect and exactly what I need. To my knowledge Avery is the only one who makes this size, so even though I am stuck buying Avery products I am extremely satisfied. The adhesive is very strong, but removes easily. These say removable, but in my experience they are strong enough for a permanent label if you need something that wont come off. Thanks Avery, just wish you had some competition to bring the price down a bit. ;)"
5,WOW,"Amazing album. If you love power metal then you should get this album. There is no explanation needed. This album will impress you and you will fall in love with it. Don't waste another minute, get the album immediately.Bye"
3,good but could have been better,"I consider myself a fairly big Blind Guardian fan and was quite looking foward to this CD. Though the song choices and sound production did not let me down, what pissed me off was the length of audience applause left on the CD after every song! I bet it adds up to 10 minutes on each CD, easily enough time to add another track or two."
2,most repetitive album in my collection,"i own tons of cds... this is by far the most repetitive. every song is all about dwarfs, dragons and all this fantasy crap/ and while i liked 'mirror mirror', the LIVE album ruins it to make it sound crappier. i dont like blind guardian very much, but when i heard their LIVE album was ""god-like"".. i just had to check it out... they were wrong. yes, most songs are long... but it doesnt really matter because it all sounds the same."
1,A disappointed reader,The plotting and situations created were unreal boring and hard to understand. There is tiresome repetition and much ado because the heroune is Decker's cop daughter. I still can't understand who is who in an unreal complicated ending. I have read other excellent Decker-Lazarus novels. Here the author has failed and disappointed a loyal fan.
1,A major disappointment,I was disappointed that Cindy wasn't killed right off the bat. Then the rest of the book could have been the investigation of her murder. Talk about a nitwit who deserved to die!
2,Stalker,"This is the most stupid book I have read lately. I don't know what happen to her writting(maybe she ran out of ideals). I was tired of all of the ""cold nervous sweat"" by page 50. I don't believe that Cynthia Decker is the only college educated police officer in the LAPD. I know that she was a rookie, but good lord, how many time can someone break into a ""cold Sweat"".Please go back to her Dad Peter Decker and move Cindy somewhere else."
2,What a letdown,"I have felt as though the last few Faye Kellerman books have been going down in quality of writing. This book absolutely confirms this for me.While I was VERY intrigued to learn more about Decker's eldest child - Cindy, I was left feeling as though this character was never really put out for us to understand. Its as though Kellerman wasn't quite sure what kind of person Cindy should be so she made her into a very ""neutral"" kind of person.Also, I found the storyline was very slow. As a matter of fact, the first 50 pages or so were incredibly boring and I had to force myself to read on.Not a great book."
2,Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy,The main vocal point of the story was very agravating and frankly i was pretty sick of reading it around the 2nd or 3rd day i think that the actors in the actually movie were ok i think that they could have use more vintage actors like Darkwing Duck or Harry Doyle. Nate Harjack was clutch in the lead role Larry Szonka and Greg Bitners attitude in the movie was just outa control with the pit stainds. I think that they need more chacthers in the book like pee wee herman or even the great Jason Bateman. Steven Segal made an appearance in the movie and it think that he could have done a little better job as Kip Peterson and Dean Kane was awsome in the hit tv show malcom in the middle
3,I should have waited for the paperback.,"Being an avid reader of mysteries, I try new authors to add to my list of favorites (Marcia Muller, Janet Evanovich, Robert Crais, Sue Grafton and Joan Hess), but this author will not be added. The storyline was interesting, but not enough so to keep me up late reading the book. I was able to put down this book for several days before picking it up again. Some characters (Scott Oliver, Haley Marx and Beaudry) were dull and undeveloped. Maybe they will be further developed in subsequent books. Additionally, I found Stalker contained too much emphasis on the religion of Rina (Lazarus) Decker. I realize this is a main component of her character, but it seemed to be more of an effort to fill out the book and unrelated to the storeline. This time could have been spent further developing the other characters in the book."
3,Overstuffed,"I should say first of all that I'm new to this long-running series, so there's a good deal of backstory I've probably missed. Peter and Rina are relegated to supporting roles here, with the spotlight going to Peter's impetuous daughter Cindy. The plot involves the reopening of an old murder case, so there are a few too many scenes of cops sitting around hypothesizing. I gather that Judaism is an important element of the series, but here the section on Jewish rituals and the trip to the synagogue seemed to slow things down a bit. Several male cops seem to antagonize Cindy, at some points I had trouble keeping track of who was who. Kellerman could have used some judicious editing in the last third of the book. Still, she clearly knows her police procedure, and what a relief to see a long running mystery series go in a new direction. (Are you listening Patricia?) Fans of this series should enjoy this, rookies should go back and start with THE RITUAL BATH."
1,BORING!!!,I would give this no stars if possible. I gave up at page 65. What a boring book. If Kellerman had cut all the krap out it may have been ok. The last straw was her picking out what she was going to wear. Do you really think readers care???? Or pages of wha they are ordering at a restaurant???? Ugh! Wish I could get my $1 back for the garage sale I bought this at.
4,Very good book,I really enjoyed this latest effort by Faye Kellerman. I was dubious at first because I have grown to so like Peter and Rina. But this was a wonderful exploration and it seems to me that Faye Kellerman's skill in writing continues to mature.All of my favorite elements were there as were my favorite characters from her other works. A nice surprise was the development of the Scott Oliver character. I hadn't expected that and it was nice to see Faye attempt to make him more human and less stereotypical. The use of stereotype as device seems to creep in too easily but I have to admit it is effective.I thought Cindy's character development was a bit heavy but perhaps it is just that I am too far from 25 to remember.Still it was a wonderful trip and makes me eager to take the next one.
3,"Not the best in the series, but interesting",I have all of the novels in the series and it has been intresting to see the characters develop over time. I liked this novel as an addtion to the series so I could see what has been happening but I do not think I would have enjoyed it as much as a stand alone novel without the previous background information. I will continue to but her books but would recommend to first time readers to start from the first book.
2,Faye Kellerman lost her touch with this one.,"I was disappointed in this book, and even more so after having waited anxiously for the book's August 2000 release. I was first in line so I could read yet another episode in the lives of the Decker family. However, this book was just not nearly as interesting and/or entertaining as her others. In fact, I found myself extremely bored with the plot and the characters. The characters were unbelieveable and they possessed little depth and substance. The story dragged as it winded endlessly around and around telling a tale that never took off. This was the first time, since I started reading a Kellerman novel, that I was not even a little bit sad to see the story end. Let's hope the next one is better! I won't jump ship just yet!"
3,Not so good.......,"This book was really hard to get through. It was interesting in a couple parts, but overall pretty dull. It took me twice as long to read it as it normally does other books. I thought about giving up a few times. It's similar to a lot of police novels already out there. You should probably save your time and read something else. I suggest 24 Hours by Greg Iles and Move to Strike by Perri O'Shaughnessy. Both were better than this one."
1,disappointed,"I've read many of Faye Kellermans books, but I just couldn't get into this one. I kept waiting for something to happen and,well,it never did. I gave up on it more than 3/4 through."
3,Why all the religious rigamarole?,"I generally like the plot of the story, but find the extensive emphasis on the fine points of Judaism intrusive and irrelevant. Seems that whenever we get moving on the mystery, it suddenly runs aground on pages of ""religious"" stuff. I've never read another mystery writer who does this (and I read lots of this genre), regardless of their particular religious persuasion, so one wonders if Ms. Kellerman is working through some personal problems in her writing."
2,As many books...,The book's beginning was wonderful but as you keep reading the story keeps boring you. The last hundred pages or so when the thrilling part must be at pinnacle the book goes out of the main plot so many times that you'll forget what are you reading. When you read a book that could be written with tenfold pages less the book is worthless. You can find many books better than this one.
2,Disappointing,"I've read all of Faye Kellerman's books and was looking forward to this one, but I had to force myself to go beyond the first 30 pages or so. It sounded as if she started writing the book without knowing where it was going. The plot was confusing. The cop language sounded forced. Do cops today really still say ""grub"", as in ""lets get some grub"" ? which appears more than once in one form or another. I also find it hard to believe that a college-educated cop is such a rarity on today's police force."
2,SLOW AND BORING,"It took me over a week to read this book. I would pick it up, read a few minutes and then think of something I'd rather be doing. The next night I would pick it up again, with the same results. I'm one of these people who starts a book and tries to stay with it, hoping it will get better--this one never did. I also hate the unrealistic endings to many books these days. Are they writing to try to get a movie contract, or what?"
1,The Stalker,"I have enjoyed all of the preceeding books by both Kellermans. In this case, however, I found myself wishing someone would simply kill Cindy and get it over with. I would have much preferred dealing with Peter and Rina's grief over Cindy's death than enduring her attitude and behavior. I sincerely hope that Ms. Kellerman brings much, much more maturity and depth to Cindy's character in the next episode. Until then, ""Cindy-the Cop"" is an idea gone very, very wrong!!"
1,a major disappointment,"What made Faye Kellerman's books so special was her treatment of a world that most of us don't live in, the world of Orthodox Judaism and how it effects the characters of Rina and Peter. This book focuses on Peter's daughter, Cindy, who is not of this world and rather boring to boot. Rina does not make an appearance until halfway through the book and then she's mostly serving food. There was none of the feisty, original thinking that she is so famous for and Peter seemed diminished as he simply turned into a worried parent. Had this book not had the framework of being billed as a Peter and Rina novel, it would have boiled down to a very ordinary, cliched story. I feel that the book was masquerading under false pretenses. I buy this series to learn what Peter and Rina are up to and to better understand their lives in the context of their faith. This book was a cheat."
4,Kellerman - consistently good!,"Like the other Faye Kellerman books I have read, this one is a good, solid crime thriller. Unlike her other Decker/Lazarus books, Peter Decker takes a secondary role to his daughter Cindy, a rookie policewoman in the Hollywood district who is being - yes, you guessed it - stalked. But by whom? and Why? As a series of new crimes reopens a year-old, unsolved case, Cindy's world in the Hollywood PD collides with her fathers new cases in nearby suburbs. Carjackings, murder, adultery, fraud - and several theories on suspects and motives leaves Cindy suspecting everyone in her life including her colleagues at the Police Department. I didn't have it figured out until the very end. Wonderful suspense!"
3,Good but......,This was my first book by Faye Kellerman and Stalker was good but Cindy's personality kind of ruined the story she was so stubborn in her ways and it ruined it. Overall i guess it was an okay book but i am not planning to buy another book by Faye Kellerman.
3,Cindy's not as good as Daddy Decker,"Cindy Decker is just not as interesting as Peter Decker. She's childish, immature and reckless. While I usually enjoy a rogue cop tale, she's just not a good cop or a good read. Hopefully, Kellerman will improve Cindy over time."
3,Overall-good,"This has certainly not got the intricate story line of some of Faye Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus novels.But it is still a well-written and entertaining read.Cindy can be impetuous and brattish, but she also has some good qualities, for example noteThe love she has for her younger half-sister, Hannah.Cindy has a lot of growing up to do!I like the way she skillfully weaves the religious family life of Peter and Rina's family into thenovels.In this one we see how observation of Shabbos (the Jewish Sabbath) is a beautiful and welcome respite fromthe chaotic and amoral world outside.Overall, entertaining , and flows easily.There are however some loose ends left undone , for example we never find out who it was that was behind the attack on Rina in the park.It is also better to begin the Decker/Lazarus series with one of Faye Kellerman's earlier novels."
2,Slow,"This was a slow ""cops talking to cops"" book. While I respect any author's wish to experiment, I found this a less successful entry in the series. I also missed the religion element that first attracted me to these books. I also found Cindy's behaviour somtimes exasperating: If an officer of the law does witness a shooting episode, as she did before the action takes place, wouldn't that officer report this?-- Per"
1,Cindy Go Home-,"In the past, Kellerman has consistently drawn complex characters that the reader is interested in and can identify with. Cindy is not such a character.Why would anyone be interested in a narcissistic little twit with a wardrobe obsession? Why would readers want to endure in literature a character whom in real life we would avoid like the plague? I'm too busy a person to spend my time with someone so shallow and trivial. Cindy has no moral depth, no psychological complexity. We don't identify with this character; we don't care about this character. On the other hand, we desperately miss Peter and Rina.Altogether, this book was a disappointment--to say the least."
3,Most predictable story line unlike Kellerman's previous,"As a reader of Faye Kellerman's previous books, I found this book not up to the degree of excitement and unpredictability as others. She seems to be filling pages with unnecessary and detached themes which I feel did not justify the storyline. Ms. Kellerman is by far one of the greatest mystery writers of our time. I only hope she can maintain the quality of her previous books in those to come."
3,Not as good as the rest of the series,"I did not like this book at all. Some of the things that Cindy does are just plain dumb -- not calling for backup, because she is afraid her co-workers will look down on her -- but dying because she does not have backup will not make them look down on her! There are a few other things. Also, I don't know how much I buy the paranoid cop that can keep things hidden for a year, but then cracks."
3,"Beautiful watch, but...","Acknowledging recommendation from the Seiko website, I purchased this watch through Amazon from an authorized dealer in Ohio.It arrived within 3 days, & I was pleased to find it even better looking than pictured.Two weeks after I began wearing the watch, I began to experience random failures of the clasp, i.e., it became difficult to latch & would periodically open by itself. I took it to my local jewler who worked on it but was unable to fix it. I checked the warrenty & found that it ""does not cover the watch band made of a material other than metal...""Since mine is metal, I contacted the retailer in hopes of resolving the problem. The retailer suggested I contact Seiko, but warned they might not cover the clasp.Bottom line, I had to pay Seiko another $25 + shipping for a new clasp & another $10 to have my jewler put it on."
5,Christmas Present,"I got this watch with a gift certificate from my daughter. This watch is beautiful! It is very classy, it's a nice size, and I like having the calendar feature."
2,Almost a Great Product but Ruined by Bratty Character,"I find it very disappointing that the creators of this product don't realize that an unspeakably bratty animated character ruins this product. The Jumpstart team is so loaded with technical talent and teaching savvy, but apparently they don't think that social skills matter, since the whole product is centered around a loud and sassy girl who is bad company for any child. The marketing team at Jumpstart apparently believes that their product won't sell if animated characters are courteous and supportive. I never buy their products anymore because I don't want to have to spend time reminding my son never to imitate the appalling behavior portrayed on Jumpstart."
2,Not what I expected,Just purchased for my 8 year old after having bought the 1st & 2nd grade versions and had been very pleased with their software. Too much story line to stay interested and the graphics were horrible compared to their other games.
2,Cover gives it away (mostly),If you read the back cover of this book then you basically know what is going to happen . However the advertised third force is a furphy and is unsatisfactorily set aside . This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller .
5,"high energy sundtracks, another perfect from warner t.v.","For those delving into euro dance, the two top producers of quality club music are telstar t.v., and warner t.v.. This paticular compilation has 3 c.d,s packed with high energy sound. Telstar t.v. produced clublife 2 1998, which is also outstanding."
2,holster,Did not fit the gun it was supposed to fit. very dissapointed. had to return item . would not recomment it for the gun listed
3,"ok look inside the RW, just not all that & a bag of chips","I was expecting more, I want more, give me more! It was okay, but it wasn't that earth shattering, I expected it to be longer, and give us something a little more in depth. Hopefully, the next video, will be a little more. But it still is worth watching if you are a loyal Real World fan. END"
2,Don't bother with this one!,"THis video was very dissapointing. Not much of what is on the video is new footage. If you are an avid RW watcher like I am, then this video will do nothing for you, so just go to a video store and rent it."
2,Save Your Money,"This video was very disappointing. You really don't see much more than what is already shown on MTV. Probably if you buy one of the books, it would be more satisfying. END"
1,Awful,First off it is edited for G-rated material only - no nudity isshown - no swearing is heard everything is bleeped out and there arebig black bars covering anything exposed. So the title You never saw fits - you never see anything.
1,Charms weren't charming,"I had ordered the sweet and sour Charms before and was very happy with them. So I was very disappointed when the sweet pops arrived. A large amount of them were not only broken but shattered. Also, all but about 10 of them where cherry. Don't get me wrong, I like cherry. But other flavors were supposed to be in there. I only got one watermelon and one blue raspberry. I will not be ordering from this company again."
2,Odered Sweet and Sour Pops and got Sweet Pops,"I received this order of pops today March 24, 2011 and was not what is pictured. I got sweet pops instead with a small label on the plastic that the box is wrapped in stating sweet and sour pops. Then when you open it you do not have equal amount of variety of pops . You get 19 cherry, 12 Strawberry, 11 grape, 5 orange and 1 blue razz berry. Misrepresentation of merchandise."
4,Neal Roberson Is HOT!,"Neal Roberson's new sophmore album ""My Story My Testimony"" off of Black Berry Records is fresh and anointed. I recommend the hot cut ""You've Been So Good"" and ""Don't Let The Devil Ride"". The cd was recorded live in Morton,Mississippi and is a perfect masterpiece of gospel music. I recommend this cd to everyone you must get it!"
