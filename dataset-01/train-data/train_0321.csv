5,Funniest Film I've Ever Seen!,I haven't laughed out loud at any movie as much as I did this one. I hope they do another.
4,Funniest Satire Since 500 B.C.!,"I'd expected a limp, pointless cartoon (I'm not a fan of the T.V. show), but instead found the sharpest, most dead-on satire since Aristophanes wrote ""Lysistrata"" some 2500 years ago! Parker and Stone are not the slacker goofballs they like to pretend they are; they clearly know their comedic antecedents and tap into that knowledge to make us laugh, think and re-evaluate our times. Sadly, those targeted by their scathing satire will undoubtedly never watch this movie. No matter. The fact that the moral conditions addressed here will probably go unchanged somehow makes the movie much funnier--it's like a tremendous, big, vivid private joke."
5,south park bigger longer and uncut,i have nothing to say except the people that invented south park rule
3,"Good Movie, Bad Price.","I guess people are starting to think that I can only find faults in DVD's ... but I can also find fault in the pricing! South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut one of the funniest movies of the 90's, but there's no justification for the... price tag. This DVD has no special features aside from three or four trailers, yet they feel justified pricing it above Fight Club, which has more goodies than you can shake a stick at. I go to Target, Amazon, Best Buy, whatever, and I see... dvd's with more features. I just don't think the price tag justifies the lack of features, so I'll stop before this evolves into a whirling maw of the same repeated complaint."
5,Smart,"... The point of this movie is to confront uncomfortable issueshead-on through blatant language and violence, and yes, crude,childish humor. But remember, we were once children, whether we would like to remember or not. END"
3,"South Park : Bigger, Longer & Uncut","First of all, I am a fan of the Southpark TV Show and have no problem with ""raunchy"" humor. I'd like to point that out in case my three stars are considered the typical comment from someone who finds the show distasteful. The only problem I had with the movie is that it wasn't funnier than the TV show. As a matter of fact, I can recall a good amount of episodes that made me laugh more often. The Southpark Movie is pretty much a good tvshow with extra length. It's definitely entertaining, but for lack of a better example, I'd say the Beavis and Butthead movie would be a safer bet if you'd like an animated comedy TV show extracted into a motion picture."
3,A fan let down,"At times this film attempted to shock by introducing swear words without reason - which I suppose is part of the appeal of South Park. This usually works in the half hour episodes, but becomes a little tiresome after 32 minutes. If you're a fan you will NEED to see this, but don't expect to enjoy as much as the half hour episodes. I must say that I though the introduction of Saddam Hussain as a homosexual was an absolute blinding idea - Comedy Central 1 Middle East Tyrant 0."
3,I Think I Prefer The Show.,The show Is hilarious but the movie is nothing but a extended episode.I love the vulgar parts but the rest isn't nothing new.Nothing special at ALL.Still good though.And it arrived very quickly.
3,kinda good,has some classic moments like what cartman says to garrison after seeing the movie and canada adresses the U.N. i got kinda bored. one big problem is Canada looked to be winning the invasion. America would kick canada's A$$!
1,AntiChrist of Cartoons,This trash speaks about God in the most disrespectful way. If your a christian avoid this film and don't let your kids talk you into buying or renting it. South Park is the AntiChrist of Cartoons!
1,Why Waste Your Money?,"This is a movie only a frat house boy could love. If you're into that kind of toilet-bowl humor, then by all means, see this movie. However, if you've evolved to an intellectual plane higher than the typical locker-room discussion, then avoid this drivel."
4,"Nasty, Gruesome, but I've Never Seen It","I've never seen it, although my freinds have. (Even if thy're all RETARDs and under AGE) I saw some South Park cartoons 5-6 years back in Taiwan. The cartoon's art is based on the original way, but I'm hoping that the graphics that they are using these days have greatly advanced. I'm also very shocked about how people (Even this kid around 8 that wrote a reveiw for it and actually saw it!) actually think that all this cussing is funny! I don't really think so because I think that there should be anything that the creators want to put into their crazy movies and cartoons except for too many cuss words. A few cussing don't bother me, but once it gets out of hands, the whole movie is ruined by all the cussing.Well, the musical better be good, and not so cussy. Cause I'm gonna buy it sometime."
2,Not NEARLY as funny as the show normally is,"I wanted to love this movie, I love most every episode of the tv show. There were definitely some VERY funny parts, but they were few and far between."
1,A poor movie.,"It's not that I completely dislike South Park. I think that some intelligence is behind the humour, and, in spite of the crudeness and profanity, would rather my children watch this than many of the movies and TV shows out there now.But I honestly can't rate this baseness, this shock humor, with more than a single star. I am not in favor of censorship, I am quite liberal, and I don't have any objections to this being out there. But the language and the meanness are blunt, and not delicate or unsubtle. I would call this out-and-out mean and crude, and not define it as satire. Satire implies a dryness, a cleverness. This movie didn't have it. So I cannot say that this is a movie of good quality."
5,Just Damn Funny,"Quite Possibly the funniest movie of 1999. Always viewable, will stay in your head long after viewing"
3,"Great music, mediocre animation, offensive material...","The writers of South Park are equal opportunity offenders so watching their show and this movie, you should expect to be offended--and learn how to take humor in that.If you are really pent up, or legastic, or super conservative, you will not like this movie. If you can laugh at yourself, at society, and at culture-roles, you will find this freakin' hysterical.I have seen this twice now, and each time feel as if I need to go to ask forgiveness afterwards. It's SO bad...!The music is what sets this apart--and won it awards. The complex mixture of something classic like this music with the class-less storyline makes this a contradiction that is a success.Not for the slight of heart. ;)Consider yourself warned ;)"
1,"Poor, Disgusting, and Pathetic","I consider myself to be pretty open minded when it comes to comedy, but the first 15 minutes of this film (that is all I could watch) were not funny at all.... they were rude and obnoxious. Sorry attempt at comedy."
1,Too lousy for even a teenager to enjoy,While both my nephew and I like the series - the movie was so intollerably dumb that it was painful to sit through - We only sat through hoping it got better. It never did.
1,Garbage:Intelligence of the movie is impaired or none!,"First of all this movie is a bunch of insensitive garbage. This stuff is childish compared to an even trashier film ""Scary Movie""! The dialog is nothing but swearing. Any moron can swear. This show is just plain offensive and biggotory of the creator He or she is very ignorant of talent, humor and creativity!"
5,This Movie Is Great Mmmmkay!,"From the opening song, to the end credits, this movie loses no steam. The crude humor, which adds to the charm of the characters, and the actual plot that is satire at it's best, makes this a fantastic movie. The way the movie takes shots at nutty groups that are opposed to everything, to the MPAA, this movie is fantastic. Not to mention the great songs that are in the movie. Look out for ""Blame Canada"" and ""What Would Brian Boitano Do"", those are the best songs. So if you are a fan of the show, or a fan of satire, this is the movie for you. If you are an uptight, psycho nut that is opposed to anything that relates to any kind of creativity or self expression, don't watch it, it will just fuel your misguided fire."
5,Awesome.,"Has to be one of the awesomest things South Park has ever done. I usually don't buy movies to keep, but I defiantly had to get this. Funny, offensive, violent, everything a movie needs. I must have watched it 20 times already. :D"
5,"SOUTH PARK BIGGER,LONGER,AND THE BEST MOVIE OF 99","THIS WAS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE I EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,AND ANYBODY WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE RESPECT MY AUTHORITY.CARTMAN RULES.I HOPE THEY MAKE SEQUEL"
5,South Park the Movie: from a pre-teen's point of view.,"This is honestly the best movie I have ever seen. It may seem foul at first, but if you give it a chance it is a very funny movie. I saw this movie in theaters and I own it on DVD. This movie is about Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and kenny sneaking into an R rated movie about their beloved Canidian duo Terrance & Phillip. The movie has foul language and the boys begian to repeat it. Their overprotective mothers declair war on anada as a result of this. At the same time Saddam Hussien and the Devil are having relationship problems. Now it is up to te boys and their classmates to save terrance, philip and the fate of the world from their moms. his movie has alot of funny guest stars such as President Clinton, The Baldwin brothers and Wanona Rider. I think anyone would enjoy this movie if they bought it."
4,"great transfer, hilarious movie",Wish this movie had a few more extra's. But overall this is a great movie if you love southpark its a must have in your collection. The comedy in this movie is just fantastic.
3,"Good, but not as good as most episodes","This movie made me laugh myself insanely the first time I saw it. After a while, it's only good for a few laughs. I would definetely recommend getting it though. It's the most fun you'll have watching a movie in a long time."
5,South Park RULES!,"This movie is so funny, I've watched it 6 times and never got bored of it! I have been a big fan of South Park for a while, and when I rented this movie[I own it now],I practicly laughed myself to sleep. La Resistance lives on!"
5,Hey dillhead005,"The kid was saying that the makers of the Terrance and Phillip movie are canadian, not Trey Parker and Matt Stone. As for spoiling anything, the Kenny part is not that big of a deal. Hope you did not lose too much sleep over it."
2,alright,"funny but stupid.could have been a lot better but i still liked it.the soundtrack really just has all the funny parts on it.the soundtrack is really good,just get that instead of seeing the movie"
3,This is not for kids!,I watched this movie. This movie is really funny. The only problem is the swearing there is lots and lots of swearing. I really do not recomend kids to see this movie at all. Thank you for listening
2,Lame movie with catchy phrases,"Back in the day, I was a South Park fan. I really wanted to see this movie. South Park was a total waste of time. It's filled with jokes you've seen on the TV show and filler space musical numbers. I was bored to tears. However, it gets two stars since you'll be repeating all the phrases and lines. I hated the movie, but still coin the sayings of the film."
2,This is trash!,"I thought that this film was a major dis-appoinment, as i enjoy the show, and watch it regularly. This film relied too heavily on music, which, although funny in places, wasn't up to the task. I am very dis-appointed, i was expecting so much better from a usually good production team."
5,Awesome!,I taped this movie on comedy central and it is awesome!!!! You need to buy this or tape it on comedy central. It's sometimes on at 1 in the morning!!!!
3,"Kenny Goes Straight To HELL, Boys...","South Park is smarter than most people give it credit for. The idea of doing a `shocking' movie about the controversy caused by a `shocking' movie is pretty sharp, and the attacks on crazy moralists like the PMRC are right on. Any movie where Satan is a heroic figure has got to worth the effort, but I'm not sure you need a DVD version, I mean, hey, it's only a cartoon...."
4,Must be seen,"I missed this when it was on the pictures over here in the U.K., so I thought that I'd try the DVD. What a laugh. I've been watching the series from episode one. To be honest, I thought that it was starting to get a bit boring.This film re-instated my enthusiasm for the whole South Park thing. If you like or have ever have liked the series, then I guarantee that you will love this film.If you can find humour in foul language, sex, death, pornography and politically incorrect satire, then this fella's for you.If you don't like South Park or you're easily offended by... Foul language, sex, death, pornography and politically incorrect satire then you would be wise to give it a wide berth.It's easy. If you like South Park or that kind of humour then you'll absolutely love this film.If you don't like this kind of stuff, then don't bother, because it will offend you, with ease."
3,"good quality build, you'll need a hitch lock","It is as advertised. The unit itself is well built. The rubber pads that the bike sits on will easily slide back and forth on the bars. I'm thinking of hose clamps on the bar to act as stops. On my 1-1/4"" hitch the unit is just a little bit smaller and will pivot 5 to 10 degrees (parallel to the back of the car) even with the hitch pin inserted. Not a big deal as during normal driving (even at 70 mph)it doesn't rock back and forth unless you're going over bumps. The threaded hitch pin is milled at the end to accept a hitch lock, but doesn't come with one. you're on you own for the lock. I bought mine for $70 at wal-mart and thought it was an OK deal"
1,Dangerous pin and no replacement parts,I bought a similar bell bike rack about four years ago. I don't use it that much maybe 2 or 3 times a year at most. The pin that holds it into the trailer hitch sheered off the other day. When I called up the company they do not have a replacement part. It was a rather specialized pin in that it was like a bolt with screws and a hole in the end for the carter pin. It looks like I am going to have to replace the entire unit to be on the safe side.
5,I love this!!!,I painted and antiqued mine and it looks wonderful. I love the extra shelf. It was easy to install and I'm glad I made the purchase.
5,Review,Purchased this awhile ago. Was in my archive and I brought it back out. Like to book..Not sure why I have to re - review but whatever :)
2,Wife In Name Only,"I was disappointed in this book. The first part was good, but I got quickly confused with the characters when the story changed to Norman and Philippa. I quit reading it, but maybe will try again at a later date."
1,Not good,I usually enjoy old stories but this one was drawn out too long. I didn't enjoy this book. Thought it would be about something else.
1,No Print,I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THE FIRST SEVERAL PAGES WOULD NOT SHOW UP IN PRINT ON MY KINDLE SCREEN. I AM GLAD IT WAS FREE BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO READ A BOOK THAT IS ONLY PARTIALLY PRINTED.
1,Surprised,"I was surprised at how light in weight the phone was. It didn't seem to be worth the ... price. I have bought cheaper phones from places and had better quality. The headset was the only thing i liked about the phone. I then found out I could have bought a headset much cheaper and saved a lot of money.Thanks for listening,Gwen"
1,sound piece is not loud enough,I would have given this 0 stars if possible. I can't give this phone away beacause everyone who uses this can barely hear the sound in the earpiece even when standing next to the phone base. If you take the phone into another room it cuts out.
1,THIS PHONE IS REALLY LESS THAN 1 STAR!,"I think that giving this phone a star doesn't do it justice! It's terrible! I would give it a 50 below star if I could... It's the worst phone - can't hear anyone and can't get the static to go away! Thinking that Southwestern Bell would be a good phone, I was wrong and wasted money and have been very upset at the performance of the phone - don't even waste your time - notice it's ON SALE!"
2,It Works But.....,"it's inferior workmanship lends creedance to what my Mom would always tell me, 'You get what you pay for.' They package this little 'jewel' with these 'cute' little changeable, muliti-colored keypad covers, a small/portable build and a 'cheap' price tag. These are the things that pull the gullibe in. I've had the unit less than a year and I've already replaced the headset. The orginal was flimsy and fell apart after three(3) months. The phone's sound quality is somewhere between fair and poor. Many times I'll experience LOTS of static while using it. Changing channels will *sometimes* fix the problem. The battery doesn't tend to hold a charge thru heavy usage either. Mind you, I keep mine in the base the majority of the time. In short, I wouldn't recommend this product to ANYONE!"
5,"Rich, disturbing novel. When can we see more?","Anyone who has struggled, like this writer, to understand the mysterious draw of Asian Culture to the Gaijin will love this book. Although the surroundings are more destitute than we can imagine, where a bad run of fishing for a week can cause many to die in the Village, the people themselves maintain a dignity only dreamed of by the Sophie Rhys-Jones set.This is the most compelling read this writer has ever experienced... especially the struggle to understand how good people can brutally murder others and feel nothing. Is this a late lesson on the brutality of the Japanese in WWII?Waiting eagerly for more translations of his works"
3,Meh,"I have to disagree with all the high ratings for this book. While the imagery is amazingly well written, the book is about 4-5 times longer than it needs to be. Nothing of great importance or anything that moves the story forward happens for the first 2/3 of the book. I have no idea why we needed to see Isaku age over so long a time, and so much of this book was overflated, overstated, and just not necessary.I wonder if something is lost in the translation of the text from Japanese... Again, the story idea is great, the author's ability to create imagery is excellent, but it just lacks focus. Tightened up a bit by an good screenwriter, it could make an excellent film."
2,did someone forget to hire an editor?,"on the surface, this book is very interesting. a village uses the fires from their salt cauldrons to lure passing boats onto the rocks. then they slaughter the crew and loot the ship. they need this in order to survive as the infrequent fishing seasons do not give the citizens substantial amounts of food. the follow through, however, is not that good. the story is not as engaging as it could be. also, in a few places the wrong tenses are used. that is not acceptable in any book, especially one with such a promising premise. some passages do succeed and that is why i give it three, albeit very reluctant, stars."
1,Missing information when advertised.,I returned this product since I didn't find out until it arrived that it cannot be located near large metal objects such as the refrigerator or stove.
5,Works great for cats too.,"I was having trouble with my 20lb tabby cat ""Bob"" wanting to share my pillow (ie: push my head off the pillow) or also sleep on my head at night, there by suffocating me. I needed a solution that would keep him out of my face, but would allow my other cat ""Katie"" to sleep at the foot of my bed (where a proper indoor cat should.)I could not find a cat system that I could easily afford, so I purchased the dog system and modified the collar to make it cat safe. I tested it on myself and found the shock was very mild. If your familiar with remote trainers the shock is much more mild. (I've used a remote trainer in Flyball to train the chase out of my border collie)The system works wonderfully. I have not had a problem with my over-affectionate Bob Kitty sleeping on my face since I started using it over 6 months ago. In fact I'm considering a second transmitter for my brand new leather couch that he thinks was purchased for his exclusive pleasure."
3,Not for all cats!,"I'm sure this is great for normal domestic cats, however it did not work for my hybrids. My bengal walked right through with us hearing it was working and shook it off when she was out of the area. I made the radius as far as I could and she still ran through it. I wish I could find something to make my cats from going out of the dog door designed for a mastiff."
2,Not Working with my Dog,Well bought it to prevent my dog from going to the cat litter and eating the cat POO. Simply not working.... The dog does not feel the shock at all. The pitch noise does not seem to bother her as much as the temptation.
1,Waste of money.,"This thing is a piece of junk. Doesn't work. Some days it's strong and other days it's weak. Regardless, my dog proudly marches past it and pees on my rug. I have her collar on as snug as humanely possible and the shocker still doesn't phase her one bit."
5,No more Dog in the Kitchen!!!!!,"We got the product. At first we had it on the kitchen floor, but we kept kicking it when we were working in the kitchen. We decided to build a mount under the floor in the basement and put the sending unit on it. The signal goes thru the floor. It radiates enough to cover both entrances to the kitchen. Now, even if I drop something on the floor (when our dog has the collar on), he just looks at it and doesn't rush the kitchen to see who gets it first. We have an Australian Shepard. So, without the unit, it was hard to keep him out of the kitchen. Thank you. Great Product."
2,Not consistent,I was not totally pleased with this product. Purchased it to deter dog from going near trash. It is very inconsistent and when training a pet consistency is the name of the game. It will not work in the same area all the time sometimes it works and other times it doesnt. It is sending mixed signals to pet. and aslo with an intellegent beagle she has also figured out that the collar needs to be on for her to get signal and you are suppose to have collar on for limited hours per day so this inconsistent product gets a thumbs down from us
2,Probably won't work if your cat has long hair,"First of all, this product is VERY difficult to remove from the packaging, which seems almost welded on. Placed at the bottom of a staircase, it also has not deterred my somewhat long-haired cat from going upstairs to pee on the carpet there. The sound does not seem to bother her at all, though it might bother a dog; it sounds like an alarm clock going off in a distant room. I think I would have to shave her to have the posts deliver the static charge."
3,It's fine,This works fine as long as you don't have a big area to keep your dog out of.It will not work past five feet from the transmitter.
1,"Crap, cat ignored it!",We bought it to keep our cat away from the dog door as she is an indoor only cat. I dont know if the setting is just to low on the collar. The beep noise would sound and she'd walk right through it. I even used it it worked but the correction level is just to low. She just ignored it and would even sit next to the sensor even after shaving the hair off her neck. Sent it back and got a partial refund. CRAP!
5,Works great.,I bought this for my daughter's miniature poodle. This dog is high spirited and fast. She was darting out the front door and into the street. The collar put an end to this.
1,Nope,"Didnt work at all. Tried new batteries and everything. Dog never felt a thing...really hoped it was going to work, she's a digger!"
3,Up and Down,"Worked for about a week, then stopped. I noticed that the battery compartment required some pressure for the batteries to make contact. I was wondering why my cat was making it into the bedrooms."
1,did not work,Ordered three collars and only two worked. It was obvious that the product had been returned several times because there were still other people's return labels in the box we received. Do not waste your time or money with this one.
2,No Response,"A few days after receiving the PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet Barrier, I attempted to use it only to find out the battery compartment seemed to be missing a tab to hold the battery tight. I used rubber bands to hold the battery in, as I needed to implement it right away. I called PetSafe and have heard nothing from them since. This was around March 20th. It is now April 10th.I am not very pleased."
1,Poor Piece of Equiptment,"I tried to set and reset this deice but nothing worked. My cat walked near it, sniffed it, walked around it, sniffed it again and then went into the livingroom...the one place we are trying to deter him from. I am fresh out of options but this sure did not work. I will be returning this tomorrow..unless someone can offer some advise as to what I am doing wrong to set it."
2,Mine had a glitch,"We got a new cat that was constantly trying to run out the door, I bought this to see if that would help deter her from getting close to the door and all it did was beep. I had the distance set pretty close to the door, but no matter if she was 2 feet or 12 feet in front of the door it beeped. It got to where it drove us crazy. Mine was probably just defective since I read and followed the instructions carefully. If it had worked properly, this would have been exactly what I needed for the cat."
3,Didn't work for me,"The product wasn't defective, it just didn't work on my pet. I bought it to keep my cat away from the dog door, but the shock had no effect on her (I know it was working, I tried it on my self!) Maybe she has too much fur blocking the contacts from her skin. I'd imagine it's a good product as long as your pet can feel and responds to the shocks."
2,For Small Dogs only.,"Bought this item for 45lb dog to keep her away from back door. This item did not work with a dog this big. I was told by customer service that it works for his small dogs in the house...after I bought it. I don't remember anywhere in description were it gave a weight limit. Like I said, probably good for smaller dogs, but not one my size."
1,Innotek ZND-12 good while it lasted,"The product worked great when i first set it up. Easy to use just two buttons on the control unit to increase or decrease the radius of coverage. These also serve to reprogram the unit to control different collars. The unit had been in operation for a few weeks when i noticed that it did not seem to be deterring my dog. I checked it and the range had suddenly decreased to about 1 cm!! I replace the batteries in both the control unit and the collar and even with the range set to max it only worked in a 1cm distance. The unit is being returned and I'm looking for another suitable replacement.Pros: easy to set up and program. Simple and effective, easy to relocate.Cons: only worked for a couple of weeks!"
4,Works with Cats also,I have really liked my Innotek. I have recently brought a rescue cat into the house. My current Cat was constantly harrassing the new cat so we purchased and setup an area that the new cat could have as her own. It has worked very well.
4,"Works for cats, too","I know this is for dogs, but after our kitten pulled over the Christmas tree, I needed to find a solution. While cats do not seem to learn in the same way as dogs, this product did eventually teach her to stay away from the tree. Like any trainer, you have to help the animal understand what the ""correction"" means. Once the cat figured out that getting near the tree was a bad idea, she never went there again and it wasn't long before we didn't even need the collar....just took longer for her to learn this than a dog. As well, heavy hair around the neckline can prevent them from feeling the ""correction, so you may have to change it. It does not hurt the animal (my 5 yr old insisted on trying it on himself), but it is not a comfortable feeling, so it does get the message across. Nice solution for keeping pets away from indoor areas. Probably will not work on the snake, or lizard...."
3,Not good for cats,"This is a good product but has not been effective for the cat. Even after shaving neck fur, she still charges through the barrier just faster than before."
2,Tested It on Myself,"I had expected that our puppy would be warned by a tone before he was shocked. I held the collar on my hand, and moved within range of the barrier. The sound was simultaneous with the shock. Also, the shock was strong enough to be pretty unpleasant to me, and I outweigh our dog by a factor of 10. I called Innotek, and they confirmed that there is no advance warning for the dog.and said that the shock would increase if the dog stayed within range. The product seems to work as advertised otherwise, and is much cheaper than those that do provide warnings, but there's no way I would subject our dog to it. I returned it."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"The Zone DOES NOT function at 10 feet as described. The unit we received barely worked at 2 feet. Additionally, the collar is way too big for a small dog."
2,Too scary looking for a cat,"Although the description said it was fine for cats, it looked too big and clunkly - and like it would be a torture device - for my 12 pound cat. I just couldn't bring myself to even put it on him for fear it would really hurt him."
2,WEAK!!! WEAK!!! WEAK!!!,"Day 2 of having the barrier in place I caught my dog sniffing the transmitter. I know what you're thinking the ""sensor was not on or not properly put on the dog."" This is not true, I am a dog handler for the government, I assure you that everything was attached and activated properly. My personal dog was sniffing the transmitter it was beeping, but there was no change in the dogs behavior.There is no way that this product is going to HONESTLY prevent a dog from going into an area. It does work as a quiet alarm, but not as a static collar.I gave a 2 star review because as I mentioned it does work as a quiet beeping alarm."
1,"As affective as ""time-out in the corner"" for your pet......","I need something to keep a bad cat from doing bad things on my bed.... Thought this would work. No.... Collar beeping away and the cat doing his business like nothing was happening. If the collar were any tighter, it would be too tight and cause chocking. The test light as well as me holding the probes proved that the collar was ""working"". It just does not work on a cat."
1,"Non Working, Untested Item","PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet BarrierPaid extra shipping to get this product fast enough to save my carpet.Upon reciept, the reciever collar was inoperative. This item was listed as used in excellent working order, it was obviously not tested prior to sale."
2,Stopped Working,"Bought the collar in last week in April. It stopped working in only 3 months. Receivers still working, but collar is no good."
2,Not what I expected...,"I have 2 of these that I bought from a pet store about 3 years ago and they are still working just fine to this day. I need a third one that is why I decided to purchase the same thing but few dislikes about this one. First, the unit wasn't new. It was boxed but it was obvious that its been used. Second, the unit only worked for about 3 weeks!"
3,PLEASE UPDATE DESC. Collar not for outdoors - doggie door anyone?,"I haven't tested this product yet so will follow up with a more in depth review later. Amazon, it would have been very, very helpful if you had included in the product description that the collar does not work outdoors - no ""rain"" or ""snow"" should get on this collar. Many pet owners have dog doors but need an interior area barrier. I just had to buy an outdoor collar and now I've wasted my money on this packaged item and have an extra collar that will be wasted. Shipping it back would cost more money than buying the two items separately at this point.PLEASE UPDATE YOUR ITEM DESCRIPTION SO OTHER CUSTOMERS DON'T HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM."
4,definitely works but range is not great.,"We got this to keep my mini daschund out of the kitchen. Unfortunately we have an open kitchen the range doesn't quite reach both ends. The range is also very sketchy. Sometimes it won't beep and you're right next to it, other times it works out to the 6 feet (this is when it's on the same range setting). Fortunately for me Hershey is an extremely neurotic dog. He got zapped one time and now he stays away from the entire area as soon as we put the collar on. He has figured out though that if the collar isn't on he can go in and be safe. I would love to not have to put the collar on all the time as it looks rather uncomfortable for him to wear. But every animal is different. Daschunds are incredibly stubborn and too smart for their own good so I'm happy that it works at all!For those of you worried about a small animal (cat or dog) Hershey is 10 pounds and it has had no ill effects on him."
2,Cat didn't care,"My cat was completely unaffected by this product. The prongs, which are exceedingly huge, were against his skin and yet he stayed in the zone and did not appear uncomfortable. I was uncomfortable when I trialed it on my arm. I returned the product."
3,"Good, but not great","So if you're reading this right now, you probably had a problem similar to me: Can't always supervise the dog while you're not home and you want something to keep the dog off the bed/couch/countertop/table/etc.This product will do that for you quite well, except that it eats batteries. And they're expensive batteries, too.Maybe if they made a rechargable collar, like some of the other brands do for wireless dog training it would be better."
2,Did not work for us.,"We have a 3 year old Golden Retriever who loves to counter surf and take dirty dishes out of the sink as soon as we walk out the door. We've tried everything with no luck, so we decided to give this system a try. It worked perfectly the first day, and she promptly left the kitchen as soon as she heard the beeps. By the second day however, the shock no longer deterred her. She'll even stand there in the kitchen, and you can see her muscle twitching and it doesn't seem to phase her at all. This was a complete waste of money for us."
5,Great Product,"The product is the best we ever got, we already tried so many of other gadegts on the market, but this one is really good. We have two dogs and now they don't pee at the back door anymore, for the first couple days they didnt know what to do, but now with only the beep noise they already avoid the area.Thank you so much Innotek ( this is our floor savior )"
1,Didn't work on my border collie,"Maybe my dog's neck fur is too thick, but she didn't flinch at all no matter how I placed it on her. I definitely could feel when tested it on myself to I know it worked. It did work on my small dog though (12 pounder)"
4,Inotek Pet Barrier,I was hesitant to use this type of product but desperate to stop my rescue dog from using the LR for her waste. In a little over a week she was trained to stay out of the LR. She is now going outside! I am delighted with this purchase.
1,Poor battery design and cheap,"After recieving the product it would not turn on. I open the reciever collar to check the batteries. They were installed, but I found the design to hold and close the batteries to be very poor. At this point I decided it was not worth it and decided to return the collar."
2,Petsafe pawz away,I bought this pet safe barrier for my dogs. It arrived promptly. It worked well until my dog easily took it off and it took only one bite to render it useless. This device maybe more for cats since it cannot withstand real dog abuse.
2,No Remote Transmitter Option,"The pet barrier system works fairly well, but we were disappointed to find out that there is no option to buy a remote transmitter so that you could use the same collar for training purposes. Seems ridiculous to have to buy a separate collar system and transmitter if you want a collar for training."
1,Didn't work...even on a cat.,"Simply put, this product didn't work even on our cat.Details: We were very worried about using this on our cats since this product is geared towards dogs, but after much research we decided to go with this one. Bad idea. Our goal was to keep the cats out off of our bed at night (one of them thinks any available hand needs to be petting him at all times - quite annoying at 3am in the morning) and away from our baby's crib (no smothering my newborn, thank you). We put it on our larger cat and he simply sat on the bed with the collar beeping away and shocking him purring the whole time.Thankfully we saved the packaging and returned it and got our money back."
1,no results,"i used it for my cant and it didnt seem to bother her i changed the batterys,then tryed it myself it did work but she still ran outside i returned it over 2 weeks ago.tammy"
1,Do Not Buy - Waste of Money,"This device does not work. We tried it on a Shiba Inu and German Shepherd/Collie mix. Both dogs did not react to the shock or the sound. In fact, they both laid down right next to the transmitter. I am thinking this device will only work on dogs with no hair or dogs that are very skittish.Since it works better on humans, we will use it as a party toy..."
1,Pawz Away,"I bought two sets and found that this is NOT what I thought it was. I would never put any animal through this type of abuse. I thought it was sounds, not two prongs that shocks the animal. Just saying"
4,indoor dog barriers,"I first brought this product because I had a problem with my dogs getting on the furniture. It has worked wonderfully! However it has also made one of my dogs skidish to come even close. Over all, the Pet Barrier works well and accomplishes the job it was intended to."
1,Disappointing. Did not seem to stop or bother our small dog,"We have a Bichon Poo and we are trying to keep her away from an area of the house. Although I read reviews noting that the charge on this barrier product must be so weak to have little deterrent effect, I thought this may be the case for bigger dogs and not smaller dogs. Wrong. This PetSafe Pawz Away did not work as a barrier at all. We tested the barrier several times and heard the beeps. Nonetheless, the little dog walked right through and continued to eat the cat food we were trying to keep her away from. Height was not an issue since we tested it at the dog's height. I do not recommend this product."
3,PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet Barrier,"The barrier works pretty much as it is suposed to, but the range is much less than described. I got a range of about 8' maximum, and that was with the transmitter on a shelf about 6' off the floor. With it under the bed on a carpeted concrete floor the range was about 5', all with brand new batteries.My small dog was a little confused by the stimulation, but within a day or two he figured out that he was better off keeping out of range of the transmitter.This thing is very humane, in fact I don't think the stimulation does anything to the dog, but the high frequency sound it emits when he gets into range annoys him enough to get away."
1,lDid not work,I bought this product to keep our dog off our porch. He very quickly learned that if he ran past the area that was shocking him the device would stop shocking him and he could then sit comfortably 12 feet away from the base on our porch. The device did not work at all for us and I returned it. Maybe if you had a small dog it would work but our dog is about 75 pounds and he did not flinch at all with the shock collar.
2,Good if you have a hairless animal,"I have tried using this product on two different animals. It seems the fur under their neck is too dense for the contact points to actually do the job.Unless you have a hairless cat or dog, I do not think this product works very well.Yes, I have checked batteries, readjusted the strength or the signal, etc... it just doesn't work."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a great product.I was a little skeptical because my dog is tough, we joke that he does all his own stunts.But I am impressed, as soon as we tested it out, he stayed away from the outside door (which is what we want).Now, whether the collar is off or on, he doesn't go near the door.The range is not as far as described. I had to put it on max range to get about 4-5ft.But it has worked out because that is all I needed.One thing I did notice is that it beeps before it shocks, so the dog learns if he hears the beep, then back away."
3,petsafe pawz away instant pet barrier,installed the product to hinder my cat from opening the front door and run on the street. When it approaches it gives a beep but that is all what it does. The cat walks past it smartly and some times sits near it. It seems it enjoys the noise it makes.Am somehow disappointed coz it did not give the effect i intended to have.
2,Horrible,"I bought this item and had to return it because it wasn't ""working"". After I got a replacement from Amazon I realized that its working but its just junk. The device is supposed to be able to reach 12' as the largest range. I set the range to 12 and use the plastic checker that they send you to see if it covers the area you require. The lights do not light up until I was 2' away. Even then my dog walked right over and I could hear the beeping but he could care less so the shock isn't enough to deter."
1,Did NOTHING,"My 8 month old Husky thought it was a game! The shock was so weak she never even felt it! I would have returned it, but I came home from work one day and she had it (with the collar on her neck) out in the yard--chewed up and batteries removed! Might work on a very small dog with no neck hair!"
1,Didn't work...sent it back for refund,"Tried a variety of settings and positions for my medium sized dog, but the unit only worked 20% of the time at best. I sent it back and now I just keep bottles of cheap cologne around the house to spray on the dog when he's venturing into an area that he shouldn't. He hates smelling like an Eastern European disco so its pretty effective."
1,The Worst of the Best,"This is the nicest and most powerful single burner unit I've found. I'm on my third one now and haven't gotten one that works right yet. The first and third one I got both kicked the circuit breaker(and it's in a new building-20 amp circuit-not some overloaded situation) The second one I got has no circuit breaker problems, but cycles on and off. When it's on the whole eye glows bright red even on the lowest setting. The only way you can use it is to keep taking the pan on and off to keep the food from burning. They need to go back to the *&^%$*&^$ on this one. (That's drawing board in Chinese) If you buy one I hope you have better luck than I've had."
5,A must read for any aspiring entrepreneur!,"Could have easily been called ""The Entrepreneur Next Door"" because of the real live accounts of successful entrepreneurs. The author goes into detail of the personalities that make up successful entrepreneurs and how these personalities can play a key role in setting your own goals and objectives. Well written the book accounts twenty years of study by the author into the world of entrepreneurship. You won't put it down until you've finished it, and then you'll want to read it again!"
3,"Nice, Bike but could do better","Nice bike, but as other review said this bike does not have any bells, whistles or sounds as in the description. The rubber tires are also very think and rub againt the fenders. I had to try and shave them down, but the spike parts off and it was OK. I also found this bike to be on the small side for a 16-inch bike. My son loves it regardless because it is a Power Rangers bike, but I know he won't ride it for long because he's so tall and will outgrown this one quickly. Also, it has to be assembled. If I had thought this purchase through I would have just gone to my local Toys R Us or Walmart and picked one up for the same price plus had it assembled for free or cheaply!"
4,Nice Bike,"It's hard for me to write a reveiw on a bike that I don't ride...but my stepson seems to love it. This was his first bike and he's still learning to ride it but he loves the power ranger theme. The colors are great, the decorations would make any kid feel like a power ranger!"
2,Almost as Worthless as the Original,"This brain dead remake of the same crap from Django (1966) pits a long haired older (Nero) who doesn't even seem interested in the role. From the absurd opening shot of two old geezers shooting each other, to the more insane mad pirate Captain who lives on some slave ship steam hauler, this film has nowhere to go. Sadly wasted are Pleasance, in a film he made only for liquor money and Nero, who could have picked a better writer and director than his old friend. Everything about the picture looks cheap, the effects, the boats, the costumes and we don't really get a sense that a story is being told, just pointless bad vs good archetypes. Avoid this nonsense at all costs."
1,confusion over the title,the video called the racing game aka needle is not the is not the video with emma bird sean mcee etc this video is called needle and is taken from a 90s tv production the one i received is a dick francis novel so beware the discription that comes with the racing game is false
2,"ok, not great","relatively poor directions, a little too dependant on moldered tabs when metal hardware would be much sturdier, took longer than it should to put it together, door wont close. Still nothing else like it on the market, so it gets used..."
2,dissapointed,"In a word, flimsy..I've seen suncast products in big boxers and they all looked pretty sturdy and well made..Well this isn't..It's shaky and not as sturdy as I hoped..It assembled fairly easy and hasn't fallen apart, but I must say I was expecting something more substantial..Oh and another thing..Quality control is lacking in this product..The doors don't close well and pop open frequently..This thing isn't worth a hundred bucks or so..Maybe forty, tops.."
3,Construction and workmanship,The body of the cabinet is ok but because the side flaps do not attach evenly it makes it unsafe to use the sides for anything. Would not buy again.
5,Very Handy!,We recently purchased a spa. We needed something to keep the chemicals in and something to put next to the spa to place drinks on. This works perfectly!! I was able to assemble it in 30 minutes without any problems. Each piece is marked and the directions were simple.
4,Works fine for apt living.,"The finish on top is ugly. It looks very plasticky, so it may not fit into your environment very well. Overall the price is good for this unit."
1,Don't buy,"Stay away from this one. Though I've used many Suncast products in the past, this one is a pain in the you know what. First, all the partswere not in the box. After contacting Suncast, they very graciously agreed to send what I needed. It took 2 months to get them! The parts donot snap together as they are supposed to, the doors don't stay shut, and the top wont stay down. This was my $100 follie!!"
4,No problems.,"Went together in less than 20 minutes. No warped parts that I can see.Will serve its function. A little pricey, but I'm happy."
3,Stubborn to assemble,"Despite what other reviewers say, this patio preparation table is difficult to assemble. It is not complicated but it takes a lot of pushing, squeezing, pounding to put the parts together - not for the faint of heart. It took my wife and I about 1 1/2 hours to assemble it. In the process we used several screwdrivers, a small hammer and hair dryer. A hair dryer? Yep. The plastic was warped and difficult to handle. By warming it up it made it possible to get the pieces together. The screw driver was not for screws but for prying and digging to get things to fit. The hammer finished the job.My suggestion is to allow the unassembled table to warm up before assembling. Ours was delivered in cold weather and had been on the UPS delivery truck all day. We started to assemble the next morning but it still was not warm enough. Several pieces were warped which made it difficult.Now that it is together it is fine."
4,Nice product,It is a great product for the price. The prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels. It was easy to put together too.
3,No Instructions Included,"I received the Prep Station very quickly and was eager to assemble it. Upon opening the carton, it was obvious that I had received a previously returned item and there was no assembly instructions included.I was able to figure out rather easily the snap together assembly but could see that someone had previously assembled the two side panels, the rear panel and the bottom piece. At that point I assume it was not the size they expected and stopped any further assembly since the remaining components were `factory fresh'.Upon full assembly, I was disappointed in the doors being very difficult to open and close securely and overall the unit appears rather flimsy. Only time will tell how it will hold up. I believe that for the price I paid, I probably could have found a more sturdy type of cabinet that would be more stable."
3,Not bad for the price,"For the price, this isn't a bad unit. It took me about 30 minutes to put it together. I can see where some of the reviewers here got really, REALLY, frustrated. My side panels were slightly warped and it made it a bit difficult to snap them in place. I could see where if they were any more warped, they would be nearly impossible to fit together.All in all, though, things went together pretty smoothly and it's a functional unit. I wouldn't leave utensils or anything like that in it as the unit isn't completely dirt/water proof, but everything seems to work really well and I think it will be great next to my grill."
1,Impossible to assemble,This piece of crap was impossible to assemble. Directions are awful and the pieces don't match up. Returning. It was good concept in theory.
1,So disappointed,Not worth the time it took to put it together. The contact paper (faux finish top) was peeling off before we even put it together. I would have returned it but i needed a work surface by my grill for 4th of July cookout. I guess im going to have to peel it ALL off and then find something to cover the top with.
1,Impossible to assemble,"We just received this product and have spent two hours so far in trying to put it together. We can see how it SHOULD assemble, but the holes don't match up. It makes me feel that the other reviews that assert this product is a snap (bad pun) to put together are fictional reviews, submitted by the manufacturer."
2,Not worth over $100,The concept is good but the material is cheap. The plastic will warp and the doors will not close. Also one good hit and it will shatter. Worth $50? maybe. Worth over $100 - absolutely not. I cannot endorse it for the cost alone. For $100-$125 build something out of wood.
3,It's just OK...,"I ordered this prep station because I didn't really feel like building one myself, but I probably should have. The product itself isn't horrible and the idea behind it is good, it's just not manufactured well.The doors don't close all the way without really slamming them shut. And even then they do not always stay fully closed.The pieces are a little warped, so they don't line up 100% correctly, so that helps to restrict them from closing accurately.Also, the table top has a fake looking tile thing on it which is already starting to bubble and fall off. It's only been outside for about a month. I am curious if it will peel off fully, or leave some sticky stuff behind, but time will tell.All in all, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. If it was $60 I wouldn't be so disappointed in it, but for $100 I expected more."
4,BBQers helper,"Love this prep station for organizing grill implements, matches, newspaper kindling, paper towels, cooking spray, grill gloves..all those things that were scattered around the kitchen and yard. My husband is the griller and this was a birthday gift. He's pleased with the extra space for his grilling projects and I'm the happy recipient of his BBQ masterpieces! Fairly easy to put together..had to mess with the bottom door a little to keep it closed."
3,It's OK... almost,"It would be nice to include list of parts in the package and an instruction, but none of these nice features are included.The main reason I bought it was the white color, because my patio is all white. On the product picture this station is white - in reality it is dark dirty beige.On the bright side: it is really easy to assemble, if you figure out where to start. If some parts do not fit - turn them around, and then they'll snap on place."
4,Nice outdoor cabinet,This is a nice outdoor cabinet but it was very tricky to assemble. The directions are not very clear and you need to be rather strong to snap all the pieces together (no tools are required).Other than that it's nice looking and it keeps my patio dishes and linens clean and dry even in very wet weather.
5,My husband loves this cart!,"We redesigned our deck and needed a new storage unit by the grill. This fit the ticket. Not only does it look good, but it if functional. Make sure you read the directions before you assemble because once it snaps together,you are done. My grill master husband loves it!"
4,Lightweight and just the right size,"I wanted a table for my little Weber Q grill on my narrow balcony. Was looking for something with a standing height work surface that wouldn't rust or need repainting. That lets out most outdoor side tables, metal, wood, etc. So this is just right. It's lightweight and easy to maneuver to sweep behind, holds stuff like wood chips and skewers out of the elements, and feels stable enough. I can see that eventually it's going to warp and the doors will stop opening easily. I should get a few good years out of it. On the other hand, if it were stouter material, it wouldn't be so lightweight! As others have said, it was very easy for one person to assemble and carry out to the balcony."
4,Quality Issues On An Otherwise Great Cartoon,"I was so excited to find out HeathCliff and the Catillac Cats, one of my favorite cartoons from the 1980's was released on dvd. After viewing some of the episodes I found that they were still as entertaining as I remembered them.Now for the problems, the picture quality could be much better. The picture has these little flicks of black and white lines in them that come and go very rapidly.(I can't think of any other way to describe them).Also, some episodes from the first disk have a wavy like appearence in the backround on the left hand side in a few scenes. I know these issues are not due to a defective copy as several people I know have copies that due the same thing. If you are willing to overlook these small problems and you love Heathcliff then I would recommened buying this DVD set."
5,my review,"this dvd is great this is ""as aired originally"" without commercials very happy with this purchase, and this dvd has special features"
4,Great speaker if your wife doesn't mind the size.,"This speaker is huge for a center. Bring this monster home and be ready for a domestic dispute with the wife. I'm speaking from personal experience. It's like putting your sub-woofer on top of your T.V. This is a very good speaker. It has the looks, weight, and sound quality of a full sized stand-up. I agree with the other reviewer. Not much to add there. Music with this speaker sounds ""full"". If you can win the battle at home, this is worth keeping. On a side note though, for 1/2 the $, the c250 is more practical and sounds almost as good. I think it's a better deal for the price, but after using this one, I can't go back to something that's almost as good. E Expo is great and ships fast, no problems and good customer support. They delivered a replacement grill for me that was falling apart."
5,Killer!,Absolutely love the beta series. This center channel is amazing. I literally have to turn it down a few pegs or it overpowers everything else. Dubious spousal acceptance - it's larger than you think.
5,VANNS: BEST ITEMS AT THE LOWEST PRICE.,"The speakers are amazing as noted in many reviews. I do want to point that they also have the greatest customer service. They answer phone calls right away and emails within 24 hours, and go out of their way to make you happy. Thank you so much Lady B.Wilson. You are an angel.A."
4,"Thorough but somewhat technical, not for the beginner","Anyone who has read Mr. Walker's work understands that he takes a very technical and analyitcal look at the sport of yacht racing. It is definatly an effort to get through the book, and I feel that the beginner will not get much out of it. Overall, he is very thorough and on target. There is much to be learned from the book, and it will make a person a better racer.One humorous aspect of the book (and all of Mr. Walker's writing, for that matter) is that most of his examples consists of times that he has screwed up and lost the race. The reader occasionally wonders whether he should be taking his advice.... ;) However, the examples are often excellent illustrations of the point he is trying to make."
2,Disappointing,"I've read a few of Maggie Estep's books and I found Hex to be rather disappointing. I like her writing, but her story telling is somewhat lacking. I like it when I want to keep reading to find out what happens next but with Hex it was a little painful - there wasn't much suspense or action until the very end. Hardly any of the chapters actually moved you through the story. A lot of the scenes were unmotivated and sort of lagged on. Estep also writes from different character's point's of view and this is more annoying than illuminating."
4,Mighty fine read,"Fine, tasty, terrific reading. A new series and pithy. Difficult to describe but it has to do with a Bach-crazy happenstance personal detectitive with lots of of interesting friends ... and horse racing. More than that, you need to learn for yourself. Terrific reading!"
5,"Great cable, super price","This cable is great quality. It is thicker than most cables you get and then ends are much higher quality than the typical molded platic ends on most cables. The price was the best part of the deal, I am very please with this purchase"
2,A TRUE CHRISTMAS ANGEL,"This sentimental gem by the author of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm glows with familial warmth and the true spirit of Christmas. A frail ten-year-old girl named Carol (because she was born on Christmas Day and her mother heard the carols from the church next door) plans a memorable Christmas for a poor family of 9 children who live in the back alley. Carol wants nothing for herself this year, since she feels already blessed by the riches of love from her own family.Quaintly narrated with occasional old-fashioned words to remind us of its century-old setting, this book may not appeal to hardcore 90's school kids, who prefer action and popular slang. But the messages of family unity, bravery in the face of hopelessness, and cheerful self-sacrifice provide inspiration, especially during the holiday season. Perfect to be read aloud a chapter at a time--promoting intergenerational literary pleasure and special family memories."
5,good book,"Thank you.Loved book.My father had a copy when he was a child,but it has got lost through the years."
5,Perennial Classic,"When I was a child, an aunt gave us a copy of this book. We read and thoroughly enjoyed that book till it was singed years later in a house fire. Now, I have the eBook. There's so much to love about this story--from the doting Bird parents and brothers, to visiting Uncle Jack, to the fiesty Mrs. Ruggles and her ragamuffin children next door, to the long-suffering but big-hearted Carol who brings them all together for an unforgettable holiday. This is a classic for the whole family to read and re-read every Christmas season."
5,Good but not for everyone,"I first read about this band in a local publication and I purchased the CD because of the favorable article and the fact that they are on Sub Pop. I immediately fell in love with the first listen. But having said that, this record is not for everyone. It's definitely an acquired taste. The production quality is poor (most of the songs soud like they were recorded live) but this does little to take away from the music. I would recomend this band to anyone interested in Neutral Milk Hotel, Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, or Modest Mouse."
5,Pretty good,This book got me thinking about what factors it takes to start a successful business. I like the author's writing style and the way he walks you through a case study through the entire 44 factors. It would be nice if he considered more than one hypothetical case study (laundromat) though.
1,Not on Kindle,"Will it fly? Not on Kindle. The Kindle edition of this book is unreadable. By unreadable I mean there are portions of the text you can not get to show up. Adjust the text size switch to landscape, do what you may they won't show up. This is my experience with the Kindle 2."
2,Useful for a college class but not so for real world,"If you are looking for help on launching a business this is not the book. In this book, the author provides 6 pages in the subject of helping you find the right idea. The rest of the book is just a scorecard of 44 criteria which you should consider; he then explains one by one and assigns weights to each one to arrive to a final score. So you bring the idea and the author tell you criterias to consider and you add up the score and that's it.."
5,MADDIN AS ANODYNE.,"Maddin starts his autobiographical tour with a movie 'dream list' that announces his taste is far from the contemporary mainstream. Journal entries provide a multifaceted portrait of the filmmaker via indelible childhood memories, plentiful enthusiasms, and unstinting self-evaluation. His journalism and film treatments expand the picture. I keep picking up this collection for pleasurable re-reading, and jotting down movie and book titles he mentions. If you're weary from too many books by Hollywood insiders, this is the perfect anodyne."
5,Great Old-Time Entertainment,"Although the age and quality of the originals was somewhat lacking, this collection is probably the absolute best that can be found. For you old-time western movie buffs, go for it!"
3,Question,I very much like the look of this seat but the desciption doesn' state if it for a round toilet. This is one fact I think should always be included.
3,Rather disappointed (more an introduction than meaty text),"I disappointed enough with this book that I am returning it. I was hoping for a more intergral analysis of Napoleonic campaigns and how each marshal played a part and played off each other and how Napoleon used them against each other; not a series of short, independent, mini biographies. The sections devoted to each marshal add little new if you already know the players - merely sketch out the high and low points. A book for beginners in the Napoleonic campaigns. Missing a list or sources and references. In scanning the text I found that the author draws conclusions regarding the competencies of certain marshals that I happen to disagree with and he adds little enough justification or new material to change my thinking. Very little of their complex, individual personalities comes across. For myself, I would give it two stars but it could be a resource for some (hence 3). The factual information is accurate if presented dryly."
3,"Product works, but not for this Watch!","Nice product, slow but turns properly and is definitely quiet!! Good choice for a cheap fix. I'd reccomend this product."
4,smart ic timer review,Good product for the price. Delivery a little slow when you choose ground delivery. Got exactly what was described on the site...
5,Tech Swiss Double Watch Winder,"This winder works very quietly and does a fine job, thanks to its various settings. Having the choice of different winding intervals appealed to me, as did being able to wind two watches at once. Compared to some brands, this one is very reasonably priced. I am pleased with my purchase and can recommend it."
4,Much quieter than earlier version.,"I have one of the earlier horizontal versions and although it seemed quiet in the daytime, late at night, it could sound quite loud. I was hesitant to order this unit due to that. But after looking at the specifications further, this model seems to have more features than the older model so I took a chance considering that this is about 1/4 of the price of others I have found. When I first received it and turned it on, I was amazed at how much quieter this models was compared to the earlier one. I am not sure about the durability of this design, but I have had the first one on 24/7 for almost a year now and it is still going strong. For the price, this is a good buy."
1,Beware !!!,"This item arrived and only one of the winders worked, I'm still wondering how long the second one's going to last ..."
3,Not worth the prize,"We were excited about this float and the large size. Used it for one day in the pool and and the end of the day it already had a hole in both, head rest and mattress part itself. Material is really thin. Not woth the prize!"
3,Good presentation of the time,I think it is a good read for once. I could not relate it as much as the publicity surrounding it.
3,Snooze Book for me.,"The book looked so boring when I opened it. The introduction is 41 pages long, and I haven't even started reading the actual story. The preface is 9 pages long. The historical annotation+index is 61 pages long. The actual story is 73 pages long, but the book itself will kind of give you an insight on a slave's life. A slave who ran away and actually became someone great and well-known. It's a story that anyone can used to pattern their life after especially when the odds seem against you."
5,Incredible,This is one of the most intriguing and personable books I have ever read. The narrative is awesome.
2,Not as expected,"I have purchased a number of books and such from Amazon, and from the affiliates. This one was just not in as good a condition as I had hoped. However, my son did and is still using the book."
3,A look inside,I am afraid it was a struggle for me to read this book. It was an assignment for the one college course I was taking. It might not have been that bad for me if I wasn't forced to read it. However it does give a good insight of a black mans struggle in the Civil War era.
4,Enjoyed this required reading!,Had to read this for my History class. But even though it was required reading I enjoyed the book. First hand details of Slave life... It is a sad time in American History but needs to be told!History helps us to not repeat the same mistakes!!
5,Truly a must read.,"I was unaware that Mr. Douglas had written several autobiographical works, of which I believe this is the first. I therefore cannot say that his later efforts addressed some of the gaps that he felt necessary to protect others, which omissions are the only count against this amazing work, packing so much into so few words. Even with the absence of more detail as to how he made is escape, I give it five stars."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I had seen a program on PBS about slavery and the beginning of the Civil war and one of the people focused on was Frederick Douglass and it got me interested. Even though this was written in this period of time I found it quick and easy reading. So many book of this time are in a language that is hard to understand, this is plain english.I am looking forward to reading his other books one day."
2,cheap but missing parts,"the book was cheap but missing the appendix,this is an essential part of the book, without it your missing a third of the history. I'm surprised it was published without this essential part."
3,Frederick Douglass review,"I enjoyed ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass"", but would not necessicarily recommend it to a person or class. I appreciate the perspective that I gained from encountering his life story, but I was never really entertained or enlightened. The story was more depressing than happy, and large parts of the story were left out for his safety reasons. Allow I respect that, it does have an effect on his account of the escape. I would say that overall this book is pretty good, but just doesn't connect for me."
3,really cheap looking,"this book looks like a knockoff of another edition or something. the cover looks really unprofessional, and the title isn't even printed on the spine of the book. however, the text is the same, so i guess if you don't mind. kinda annoying because i have no idea what book is sitting on my bookshelf though"
2,think tac toe from cameron jones,"This book was about mr douglas whole life,and how he made it out of slavery.He has traveled to the freeland,and left the pass behind him.Now he wrote books about his freedom from slavery."
5,A honest look at slavery,"Perhaps more so than any other account, Douglass gives us a look into the life of a slave. I enjoy this book on many level. Douglass writes honestly and in a factual tone. He does mince his words when he describes the brutality of slavery. Douglass demonstrates that he is an intelligent man despite his lack of education. He taight himself to read. To our youth, this demonstrates the value of education. Douglass also show Americans manipulated the work of God even in his time. Yet, Douglass found strength in that God. I think the quality I enjoyed most about this book is the fact that Douglass does not see himself as a hero, but as an average slave. This is not a typical characteristic of an autobiography. I read this book for the second time coming and going on 3 hour flights. The book is a short read, but well worth your time to read of atriumph of the human spirit."
4,Narrative of Frederick Douglas,I found the book Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass very informative and thought provoking regarding what he went through as a black man back in those days.
5,An important part of our history,"Very well written book that gives us an idea of what it was like to be a slave in pre-Civil War America. Frederick Douglass not only gives an account of what he, personally, went through, but also provides an insightful look into the world, assumptions, and justifications of the slave holders."
4,Educational as to the extremes of human injustice,Engrossing narrative revealing the many faces of racial ignorance. Religious bigotry is also evident. Much for America to be ashamed for our history.
4,"Interesting, but...","Interesting, but can get dull fairly fast. Somewhat strange to read in a slave's own word the life and times of his bondage in such a matter of fact way. with that said, good read overall."
4,A Struggle Against Mankind,No more than 300 words.I highly recommend this book becasue its gripping. It brigns you in right from the start. Douglas does a great job in making the reader feel that you are right in the middle of the action.The only
2,School need,"My son in high school needed this particular book for class, not such and interesting book but more of a necessity."
4,Very Good,"I had to read this for a freshman history class. I dreaded it before because I usually hate historical nonfiction biographies, but I was quite surprised. Anytime somebody says that Affirmative Action is necessary because of past wrongs, I direct them to read this book. This man had the drive to learn to read in secret (at the age of 8) and ultimately escape to the free North to become an author. And his conditions were FAR worse than anybody's today! It's a very inspirational novel. It details the horrors of the slaves having to be split from their families and the hardships they had to endure. It also gave some insight to the mindsets of the slave owners. This is not a long book and is well worth an afternoon."
4,Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"This narrative book of Frederick Douglass was very interesting. It talked about the slaves in the 1800's. Mostly it was about him and how he lived during the years. I like this book because it gave me a picture what he was doing. It makes me Frederick Douglass instead of himself. When I read this book, it makes me feel like a slave. The sad part of this story is how the slaves were treated during that time. They were whipped, slashed, burned, and even killed by their masters. Comparing this book with ""Huckleberry Finn"", I like this book more. It is more exciting and very educational. It brings me to the life of the slaves in the past. The more I read it, the more I liked it. All the educational books I read in the past, I like this book the best. Plus it will help you understand history better.Out of ten, I give this book an eight. Hope you will enjoy this book like me."
5,Outstanding read,"I Read Douglass for an assignment in my college U.S. History class, and was almost dreading opening this book afraid that Douglass would blame every white person for his torment. Instead I found that Douglass knew the difference between the slave owners and the people who were trying to stop the practice. I finished this book in a matter of days, and respect Douglass as the extreamly brave man that he was. The paper I wrote reflected my outrage that such an occurance could have happened in this beautiful country."
5,A story everybody should read.,"Frederick Douglass was a major figure in the era leading up to the Civil War, and the furious debates raging about the nature and fate of the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery at the time. Born a slave, brutalized and beaten down for much of his early life, Douglass ran away, educated himself, and became a major voice and major celebrity within the abolitionist movement. Eloquent, dignified, and forceful, he was an important personality in the growth of the abolitionist movement, and someone in our history that everyone should know about. This book was a sensation in it's time, exposing to the general population what the real conditions of slavery were, and what they entailed. It turned thousands against slavery, and was an important influence on the opinions of many who were ambivalent. A century and a half later, it is still a powerful testament of the time, and a powerful story of a man overcoming his circumstances to become something better."
3,"Good Book, But...","I ordered the book and it was in good condition when it arrived, but it was not the version that I was looking for. The book that came did not have the introduction by Blight and I had to return it."
5,The truly heroic story of one man's rise from slavery,"""From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom...Though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read.""One of the greatest books ever written. If you have yet to read it, you are depriving yourself of one of life's finest experiences."
3,Graphic,"This autobiography of Frederick Douglass is extremely eye opening. It really puts into focus the absolutely crushing life of a person in slavery. I recommend reading this eloquently written book to any and all interested in an entirely different point of view, from the eyes of a slave, on this subject."
5,Everybody should read this,Every American should read this very simple short story of one mans escape from slavery. Most people may have heard of Frederick Douglass but I suspect that very few know much about his early life.
4,Knowledgeable Read,It was a book I read long ago and had to re-read. Needs to be read by all African Americans
5,A MUST READ FOR WOMEN AND MEN TOO.,"Lynne Russell teaches women that they can do anything. If you lacked self confidence before you read this book, you certainly gain lots of it after you have finished. I had my daughters read it and they both feel more hopeful that they too can always do better. It's very up beat, positive and funny. Men, feel free to read this too..you will enjoy it."
3,Victoria's Secret,"If the title of this book offends you, do not buy the book because the content is equally earthy. How much did Victoria's Secret pay for this 200 page ad? If you are mildly curious about the various behind the scene exploits of CNN headline news anchor this book satisfies. If you want personal advice there are better sources. One wonders, what will she spend her money on after her hormones change? Have the stories about poor starving opressed people in her news had no impact on her choices? I hope that this is not the last we will hear from Ms. Russell!"
5,Must have,"This is the book to buy first - the one others should be measured by. Interesting, scholarly, but above all informative and practical."
3,Nice round up of Subverse Artists,"I like this album. But its not in heavy rotation! The songs on this album aren't necessarily the best songs from these artists, thus, it fails to draw new listeners to the Subverse roster.If you're new to Indy label hip-hop, you should buy this to get a different perspective on the indy scene. My favorite tracks on this CD are Overground, Yikes, Runaway always 2, Dead Bent, I Hear Voices, and Queen Supreme.I highly recommend buying Obliesk Movements from the Micranots, Operation Doomsday from MF Doom, and Project Overground from Scienz of Life. If you live in a big city, chances are these artists may have performed, or will be performing there soon!"
5,This is the only book of its kind in the world.,I have read most of the popular books about vitamins and minerals. The PGN is the only guide in the world that tells me who makes products that can be trusted. I am concerned about my familie's health. Thank god for the PGN.
5,A focus on the human elements of companies,"For a perspective that focuses entirely on the human components of organic companies, pick up Lean & Meaningful: A New Culture for Corporate America (Oakhill Press, 1998) by Roger E. Herman and Joyce L. Gioia. The authors explore what employees want in an employer, both in terms of benefits (like retirement plans) and atmosphere (like a family-friendly environment). The book also includes an extensive list of resources. CIO Magazine"
4,LADY TURNS INTO HER CAT,"A lady gets into an accident and goes into a coma. Her soul migrates into her little cat's body. As a cat, she finds out her ex-husband [who she thinks is a jerk (but secretly still loves)] still loves her. It's a bit hard for her to move around and convince everyone she's still alive when she's only got ""paws"" in place of fingers and ""meows"" in place of a human voice. It's pretty cute and funny. Meanwhile, her ex-husband doesn't understand why this strange black cat(which is her inside of a cat body) is following him around!"
4,Cooper has no peer,"In common with most people, I like to be inspired when I write down new contacts' names. With this address book, I am able to do so in an encouraging way, making pleasant connections between new acquaintances and the ""angel"" that their name happens to correspond to. ""Inimitable"" Idi Amin, for example, and ""Generous"" Genghis Khan. The book loses a star for forcing me to make an unwelcome, faintly erotic connection with Deng Xiaoping."
3,Clamps down,"3 1/2Tiny old-school party d+b explosion of a reminder when the letters meant something in idm, this is probably worth the fuss to compliment his modestly received full-length."
5,good for little ones,This was a quick and cute read. It held my two-year-old's attention and has both Steve (just a page) and Joe so it satisfies both requests at once.
1,This stinks.,I took it out of the box to put batteries in for my son for Christmas. Tried them out. Would not transmit more than 10 feet. I am sending them back. Does not work.
3,"Great design, poor, very poor transmition quality","Bought two sets of this, great quality in the desing, material, etc... BUT very poor quality in the walkie talkie transmition, the manufaturer forgot that they are selling walkie talkies, the range is about 4 meters !! better talk louder and pretend I am talking thru Buz !!!This walkie talkie did not reach infinite and beyond, by far !!"
5,"One of the best comic books i've ever read,","This is a great book about shugo, a regular japanese boy, whos sister finds that they won legendary .hack characters for avatars into The World, a online game that is so realistic, you have to log off to stop playing. you put on a VRS, (virtual reality set) and it brings you into a game! He finds many party members, too.Pros:.Shows what the charecter is feeling and thinking in shapes andsmall words.Very exiting and enjoyable.good enough to read over and over.many moreCons:.I can't think of any..."
3,Is This The Direction of the .Hack Series?,"I just got this manga. All I can reall say about it is that it is quite interesting. The book takes place after the four PS2 games. The main characters in the PS2 game, Blackrose & Kite, are immortalized in ""The World"" as hero's. Their avatars are being given away as a marketing campaign. The story takes place right as the win the give away. The two who win the avatar's are named Shugo and Rena. This manga is only worht buying if you are completly enthralled by the .hack series, other than that to any other person this would seem like some weird comic."
2,its ok.,"I got no. 1,2,3 from the library.And on the front it says national best seller now yould you say that this manga dosent deserve that title.i mean like in every 30 pages they have a picture of rien or raien or how ever you spell her name!!naked with like a sword or hands covering her(>>>) O_O.and if its not her its some other girl.its a good fantasy and has good art though.if you like hack try zatch bell or naruto!!!! ^_^"
4,good movie quality dvd,"this is a classic war movie, and with lee marvin who was a for real combat marine in the south pacific it has a sense of the realistic.... its worth owning and the quality of the dvd is very good"
5,This movie is awesome!!!,"It is most defininately better than ""Saving Private Ryan."" Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Ryan"", too, but this one is much better. Mark Hamill(my all time favorite actor)is at one of his awesomest performances(Grif) to date(second only to Luke Skywalker). However, if you really like the blood and guts movies, go somewhere else. But if you like the kind of movies that the whole family can sit down and watch together, then this is the movie for you!! I LOVE this movie!!!!!"
2,B-movie hokum,"I loved Lee Marvin in ""The Iceman Cometh"", ""Point Blank"", ""The Killers"", and ""Cat Ballou"", and I can understand how he was picked, as former Marine, to play the lead in ""The Big Red One"". Sadly, though based on Fuller's experiences, the script and direction substitute cliches for reality. Compounded by poor cinematography, it has all the feel of a cheap, '60s, TV production. If you appreciate, great military films like ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Das Boot"", and ""Paths of Glory"", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", then you will not be rewarded by ""The Big Red One"". (I donated my copy to the library.)"
3,The Big Tough One,Huge movie in its day but i seem to remember enjoying it more as a teenager than i do a decade later.Id have to agree with others that the added scenes on the DVD could have been left out on the remake as they didnt exactly add anything positive to the original cut.Lee Marvin is the ever reliable stand out in what i thought overall was a fairly mediocre cast.The Big Red One shows off a deeper more personal side of the war through the eyes of a typical infantry squad with a darker side of the war being explored on numerous occasions.It would have been a difficult task to cover the entire combat operations of the US 1st division in WW2 but the job was done quite well in a movie that wont go down as a classic but one youll be happy to have in your collection.
2,I Liked The Original Better,"I heard lots of hype for this when it came out which caused me to purchase this one instead of the original. Theres a short homosexual scene when The Sgt is in the German hospital and he is kissed on the lips by the medic or doctor. Did that go on that much that theres a need to portray it. I'm surprised in 1980 this was filmed or even thought of since gay was not in back then. Also the scene of him spanking the Hitler youth who shot the G.I. was stupid. The scenes added I could have done without, not too much substance in them. The editors were right the first time when they did this without Fullers permission. I liked it before when there was a sense of honor and pride that I got from the movie, without the sex and useless characters added."
3,Not as good as other war movies,"I have seen this movie several times and do not rank it as among the best war films. Several films that I consider better include ""Battleground"", ""A Walk in the Sun"", ""GI Joe"", The Longest Day"", ""The Train"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""They Were Expendable"", ""Twelve O'clock High"", ""Bridge at Remagen"", ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Judgement at Nuremberg"", and ""Band of Brothers."" I sometimes watch it on cable TV but will not buy it for my film library. I cannot give explicit reasons why I feel this way but can only use my experience as a war movie buff."
3,A good movie...not great but good,"This is a good movie, but is a little cheesy for my taste. I'm a little more 'Private Ryan' film. Some of the film is good. It isn't very intense or violent like Pvt. Ryan. If you don't like blood and guts, or are too young for Ryan, see this.A few acting comments: Marvin is good in this, but seems a little too old to be fighting in the Normandy invasion. Hammil is o.k., but I think he should stick to Star Wars flicks. He just doesn't seem like a grunt.A good kid movie. Cheesy effects that seem dated. My advice for hardcore WWII fans: Saving Private Ryan!"
4,The Loneliness of War,"Penetrating, outstanding war drama that depicts, with care and well constructed plot divided in many simultaneous dramas, the lives, hopes, sorrows and, before all, the profound and scarring loneliness of a group of young and unexperienced soldiers in the WW2 and the friendship and deep respect between them and their old and calused sergeant (played with intensity by Lee Marvin).Maybe the movie is a bit too overlong which reduces it's impact but is extremely rewarding to watch, thanks to the excellent cast (that includes Mark Hamill (Luck Skywalker) and Robert Carradine) and the witty and sensitive dialogues.A movie about war made with brains and heart and not with violence and prejudice."
4,A very good movie for it's time,"Although there are similarities between this movie and ""Saving Private Ryan"", the graphics in the latter movie are much more intense. If you thought ""Ryan"" was too graphic, this is the perfect movie for you. The audio quality of this movie was disappointing. Don't make big plans to crank up the surround sound and listen to bullets fly past your head. Lee Marvin was great. Nerd star Robert Caradine, a war novelist, narrated the action. He was actually very good too."
4,An entertaining flick...,"Saving Private Ryan raised the bar on war movies now, but this was a great film in the early 1980s. A great cast: Lee Marvin, Mark Hamill (Between Star Wars and Empire), and Robert Carradine help to propel the action along. My only complaint are the Sherman tanks dressed up to look like Panzers. They look really silly compared to the detailed German panzers in Spielberg's film. Nonetheless, a very entertaining movie."
1,Sometimes its best to leave things alone,I always liked this film and felt that it did a good job showing how things might have been. But it turns out that the writer/director couldn't leave well enough alone and had to go back and add a bunch of things that were cut from the original. All he did was make it longer and harder to watch. I would rather see this on tv than sit thru this long boring re-do. Too bad the original was pretty good. If you can find it buy the non re-vamped version you will like it a lot better
1,The Long Red Schlong,"This movie is HORRIBLE! It ... the ""Big One""!I can't believe that a WWII veteran, Sam Fuller, directed this travesty!Lee Marvin is too old to portray a believable American GI.Carradine is a big nerd.Most of the extras look as though they were lured away from someone's Bar-Mitzvah so Fuller could film this piece-of-... in Israel.Geez, I never knew that Eucalyptus trees grow in the German Forest? Duh!!See Sam Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" (1977) starring James Coburn for an excellent WWII B-movie. Coburn tears Marvin to shreds.Fuller, you should be ashamed of yourself!"
2,Another overrated Sam Fuller film,Saw this extended version in a theatre recently.While it looks better than before due to remastering nothing can be done to improve the low budget and pedestrian dialogue.Lee Marvin is very good but the rest of the cast is awful.
1,The Big Borrrring One,This movie SUCKED Lee Marvin leading a bunch dopey looking GIs ! It was confusing to follow . The Longest Day was cool but this movie with Marvin dressed as a arab in a German hospial . The movie was foolish from beginning to end !
2,harmed masterpiece,"I read all your reviews and I realised I wasn't the only fan of this movie, it's the strongest movie I've seen about this war. The only problem is that Sam FULLER's movie originally lasts MORE THAN 4 HOURS, it was cut by the studio and this copy you're so amazed about is unfortunately a clip of THE BIG RED ONE, the movie that you can only READ fully (check at the books). It still remains a good movie but we must hope to see one day on DVD edition the original movie wich is sometimes shown at the french ""cinématheque""."
3,no big deal here,I bought this after the film was hyped as a masterpiece by some; I found it a tiresome bore. The writing and plot development was hackneyed and there were few great lines. OK as a potboiler but would never watch it again.
2,Big Red One Has Not Aged Well,"I really enjoy war films and purchased this ""reconstruction"" with great anticipation, but it was not worth it. In comparison with some very fine, more recent films - Gettysburg, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan and the like - Big Red One comes across as a little melodramatic and the combat footage often seems unrealistic. It is simply not as sophisticated as some more current films on the subject."
4,War Classic -HORRIBLE PACKAGING MATERIALS!,"Great film, DVD done right, package LOOKS good, but when I went to open it up it took ALMOST A HALF AN HOUR AND EVEN THEN THE LOW-GRADE SUPER-STICKY TAPE ON ALL EDGES OF THE CASE RUINED THE COVER! Whoever made choices contributing to this fiasco needs to be shot! Or at least fired and drummed out of the industry. Didn't help matters that on the fancy black slip cover Best Buy had slapped a big ugly price sticker that wouldn't come off all the way, even after I heated the glue up with a hair dryer. Hey, I hope you slobs responsible for these stupid choices are reading this because you are a bunch of incompetent unprofressionals. Still, buy this DVD, anyway."
1,"""PORKY'S"" Goes To War!","Juvenile antics ala ""The Dirty Dozen"". An embarrassment that doesn't deserve the reputation it has garnered. This is the worst film Sam Fuller made and the only one I have deleted from my collection."
1,Sorry I bought this.,"One of the worst war movies ever. Cliche-ridden, wooden acting, unbelievable (in a bad way) scenery, just general yuck. The storyline is so episodic as to be almost incomprehensible, other than that Lee Marvin's platoon was first st everything in WWII. There's a sequence at an insane asylum that is so laughably bad that I had to stop watching for a while. Would not recommend to anyone who wants a good war movie, or even a bad one. A complete and total waste of time and money."
2,Gobs and Gobs of Hot Glue?,"The castle people look great, but the horses have gobs and gobs of hot glue dripping from their legs and felt saddles. The glue makes the toy look like something that no care or craftsmanship when into - a disappointment for a name so great as Melissa and Doug. I hope a Melissa and Doug rep contacts me about this problem. UPDATE: My son just put a castle guy in his mouth - the one with the black hood. When I took it away from him, his lips, tongue, and around his mouth were all dyed black. When I touched the hood - the part he had in his mouth - it dyed my fingers black. I will be looking for new castle people and will be waiting for a Melissa and Doug rep. to contact me ASAP."
2,not worth the money you save,I bought these for my son and they are falling apart after only being played with for a short while. We have other bendable people from Plan Toys and though they are more expensive the quality is superior to the Melisa and Doug products.
2,Returned them,"Well, they are sort of poorly made. The doll clothes looked sorta uninspired, and the faces on the dolls were downright scary. Get the Kathe Kruse doll house dolls. They have cloth faces, and seem more realistic."
3,Glue!!,"The dolls are cute and i like that they are made out of rope, wood and fabric and not plastic for a change. But i have to agree that i am not sure why the dolls are covered with gobs and gobs of dried glue. Not the Melissa and Doug quality i am used to. Absolutely LOVE the fold away castle though!"
2,Thumbs down.,"I ordered this book in hopes of understanding what exactly the author meant when he asked the question ""Are you a unicorn?"". It's poorly put together and the text inside is in larger than normal print so it makes the book ""appear"" to have more pages. Unfortunately, this book is no doubt written from a christian point of view so if you don't know the mythology don't expect to get very far in understanding this book. In truth I found the book just to be a summary recap of the movie 'The Last Unicorn'. He didn't really answer any of my questions which had to do with recognizing and communicating with ""unicorns"". He talks about how unicorns and lions will come together at the end of days to fight the ""evil"" dragons/red bull. (A normal reaction from a typical fear based religion) All in all, if you're not a christian or you don't think that the end of the world is coming at the start of the new millennium, I'm quite sure you will not benifit from this book."
2,"Okay, but not what I'd hoped for","I bought this book because of how interesting I found the website when I stumbled accross it. I was curious as to how he was going to explain this most bizarre theory, that unicorns are among us in human form. As I began reading it, I realised that I needed to stop waiting for him to give me a scientific basis for his claims about unicorn people being in the world, and just enjoy it for what it actually is - interesting reading, but not something backed up with solid evidence and grounding as I had expected."
2,Intriguing ideas for the new age.,I found many of the points raised in this book regarding human interaction and purpose to be thought provoking. Unfortunately (depending on your point of view) the author relies heavily on intuitive insights and paterns they have observed in thier own lives. There really is not enough refference to concrete research to substantiate many claims. It really is a book that can either be taken with a grain of salt or weighed with a measure of faith. It is Christian oriented.
1,Huh!,"Unicorns and their goal. I found it a little superficial and bad planed. Unicorns exist; they are not only the vision of the author (strongly based in the film 'The last Unicorn'); the magic around them is real. Unicorns are more than lost people.If the author wanted help (as the book says), he could explains deeply (for example) why they really got lost. In conclusion, a book only to be readed if you have nothing better to read (well, at least is a little entertaining)."
4,Read it,"Well, I think that this is a very good book, some would might say that it is, write in a christian point of wiew, well maby it is, but the autor, is constantly telling, that you do not have to be christian, to read this book, and he is right, if people is saying something else, it is because they do not understand it, in the way they could. The book do have alot from the bible, (I am not christian) but when you read a book like this, then try to feel what many of the old quotes say, you can call it religion, or you can as I do call it words of wisdom, because that is what they are. In all religions, words as these is known, but when I read something about religions, I do see the great wisdom, never the religion, because that would in many ways force me to choose. and people who choose, they do say no to other things. Just a word of advice, read the book. (sorry about my bad english, I am fron Denmark)"
4,Interesting book.,"The author is an adamant believer in what he has written. I enjoyed the book. It is written from the Christian perspective, but I did not find it to be biased against other religions."
5,touching and moving essay for enlighted souls,"I bought the book almost a yar ago, I was moved by its content, since it has given me so much.It's three months now since I began translating the book into italian, cause I believe that the message that lies throughout it is something that has to be shared with the whole world.The book surely comes from a deep inner search of the author and represents a great treasure to everyone who reads it."
3,Soul Murder: Persecucution in the Family,"Excellent book, not completely for American child abuse related problems.An extreme case of ""well intentioned"" child abuse. Gives an insight to many questio about European child rearing. The methods described here are of limited aplicability towards understanding child abuse because it describes gadgets not used in this country where parents are more likely to be blamed for over indulgence and children are more often neglected than disciplined.This is a book about abuse through over-discipline, which is still prevalent in some circles in northen Europe, mainly Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Flemish Belgium, and German Switzerland.However, it gives a clear idea of what happens when a child is deprived of his/her own personality and not allowed to express him/herself, whatever the method used to get complete control over his spirit. It is a case of extreme autoritarian parenting. Discipline taken to the extreme"
4,Persuasive and amusing,"I must declare a bias; as a scientist and an analytic philosopher by training, and now a teacher in those two areas by profession, I have always been skeptical about the ""social sciences."" I have no doubt that they perform a necessary role and can provide great insights into human situations; but using the word 'science' raises certain misplaced expectations. Winch's monograph argues precisely this position with style and verve, holding that social concerns are properly related more to philosophy than the Natural Sciences. (Of course they may use scientific methods, but that is a different matter.) There are many historical examples, and a thoughtful introduction slightly modifying some of the polemical excesses. A thoroughly entertaining afternoon's reading!"
3,"OK, but not what I expected.","The product was made out of plastic not metal as I was expecting,however it was OK. The shipping was a little slow."
5,An excellent pictorial of historical engineering achievement,This book details construction of such marvels as the wooden causeway across Corpus Christi bay and the Town Lake dam in Austin. Must reading for architectural and engineering historians and all Texans in general.
3,Disappointment,"First of all, I like the colors of this item. What I don't like is that when it was being sewn, the machinist used white thread... WHITE THREAD to sew the two main pieces together. It looks cheap and doesn't look like luxury bedding. Oh, just so you know, it's made in China (wish I had known before I placed the order)."
1,Look elsewhere!,We had the same problem as the other person; the white thread all throughout the comforter. It's incredibly tacky looking at cheap. The third party company that sells these is horrible to work with too (if you can ever get them on the phone - they don't return their messages). You'd be better off doing business with someone else.
2,stiches come undone wash ruins comforter!!,"bought from a different site and wanted to warn buyers this item feels and looks nice except for the white stiches that keep filling intact which seem to come undone very easily,which cause the comforter to bunch up because the filling layers move around,one wash and it is ruined aswell. washed on cold and airdryed the filling layers bunch up even more! and comforter can not be made smooth again. very disappointed because overall it looks very nice, if its just for show in a spare room guess its ok but not for every day use at all."
2,Poor Quality,"The comforter does have polyester fill and a very soft top. The underside is not microfiber like many of the microsuede comforters. There was a slit in the comforter exposing the fill between a black-brown stripe where it was supposed to have been sewn. Overall, poor quality. Pillows that come with it are nice though. Would not buy if I had another chance."
3,Nice book,"The book start from the Luddite and end into the current biotech world. There is a lesson that the author wanted to share in this book. That is the Luddite is not phoebe about technology. It is more about economy. The end of the chapter, chapter 10, however, has a deep meaning. It would, in my opinion, describe a true Luddite, phoebe about technology. The last chapter is about genetic modification.I really like reading from chapter 2 to 7, but I don't like the rest of the chapter. I plan at first to give this book a 5 star, then after reading half of chapter 9, I began to sense this book has a deep meaning about technology. I don't like a very sad ending. So I subtract another star after I find out that, in my opinion, the other really good chapter about technology invention, the telegraphy, the television and other great invention is used as a tool by the author to show the true but sad ending.I would still recommand that you buy and read this book."
2,One-Fourth outstanding,"2 1/2Besides for a few keenly performed post-rock instrumentals, there isn't much on this three-EP compilation to recommend with a majority of material ranging from averagely executed to pretentiously embarrassing."
1,wrong size,"I ordered the mirror and checked off all the details (car model, year, etc.). When I got the mirror, it did not fit. Luckily I have a family friend who was able to spend an hour grinding it down so it would."
4,Magazine for active inquiring minds,"I got this for my niece. Since it takes so loooong for the subscription to start (that's the one drawback to getting subscriptions - docking on star for that) I can't comment on her reaction yet. However, from what I've seen of the magazine, I like that it features a mix nonfiction articles, short stories, poems, games, comics, recipes and crafts as well as kid-created content."
5,Jack and Jill,I read this magazine as a child and ordered it for my grandchildren. I know they are probably enjoying it as I write. Thanks for making it available after these MANY years.
3,Distortion,"I wish I could recommend this disc more highly, but I have tried 3 copies, all of which had serious distortion on disc 1 at medium to high volume. This performance was originally recorded for Spanish Hispavox and released in the US on Columbia. The LPs had problematic sound, but I hoped this would be cleaned up on the CD. I actually prefer this performance of Iberia to the later one on Decca, although that one is also up to DeLarrocha's high standard. Maybe I've just had bad luck with copies (though 3 bad ones seems pretty odd)."
3,"Great performance, poor mastering","I concur with the other review that this album has some serious sound quality problem. It is different from the problems of historical recordings. Some tracks sounds absolutely wonderful while some other tracks (first few in CD 1) have a very pronounced hissing noise, still more tracks have a shifted balance. EMI really could have done a better job remastering this recording for CD release, and I hope they do in the future for this is absolutely one of the best in terms of performance."
2,Why buy this?,"I wouldn't buy a CD with serious sound issues as more than one reviewer said. Also, the Suite Espanola is incomplete and is missing 3 pieces including Asturias, one of my favorites."
5,MEMORIES OF YESTERYEAR,"MANUEL BERNAL A GREAT DECLAMADOR,EVERY ONE OF THIS POEMS,IS WELL DONE,I HAD THISRECORD IN MEXICO THE SPANISH IS THE ONE USED IN MEXICO OF THE COLONIAL I'M GOING TOORDERED AND EJUOY IT."
2,Dissapointingly shallow,"I usually like Kipling, but couldn't get through this book. The stories I read were all about the vain and foolish goings-on of the British in colonial India, told with a more voyeuristic than satirical tone. Sort of like watching a trashy soap-opera set during the Raj. I've read many fine novels about colonial society (e.g. The Siege of Krishnapur, The Long Day Wanes) and found the depictions of stubborn provincial habits and cultural ignorance to be interesting, outrageous, and often amusing, but in Plain Tales from the Hills they just seem pathetic."
3,handle with care,"A fine collection of extremely well-crafted stories.But these pages are crammed with racism, with remarks on the worthlessness of a native indian's life, their stupidity and their weakness.One of the stories starts with ""we are a high-caste and enlightened race"", any man who shows interest in the ways of life of the natives is ridiculed over pages and the only remark on the death of a native child is: ""They have no stamina, these brats.""Well written, but disgusting."
4,A Nice Collection,"I find that really good reggae/ska collections are few and far between. This is one of them. There are some really nice pieces on this, such as: KING OF SKA, JESERINE, GET UP EDINA, 007, PERSONAL POSSESSION, MOTHER LONG TONGUE, PRETTY AFRICA, A IT MEK, COCONUT WATER, WRITING ON THE WALL and others. The man was quite prolific. FYI, it doesn't have his biggest hit: Israelites.You get 46 songs for under $20. So, even tho a few are not among his best, there are plently to make it worthwhile."
1,Worthless... Ridiculously Fragile - Falls Apart,"The Skyblades Deluxe Boxed Set is absolutely worthless. Within 15 minutes it will be in pieces on the ground. The younger kids will run off to do other things while the older ones stare at the broken rocket in semi-disbelief. The construction of the rocket is so shoddy that the manufacturer includes repair parts in the box. The repair parts consist of extra wings, which are made of a very thin, styro-foam like material, which cracks after one or two flights, and some extra rubber bands for engines. The rubber bands seem to break as easily as the wings. Of course, the repair parts are no better than the original parts and the whole thing is in pieces within a few minutes."
5,The Best,"Tabac is the greatest cologne. It's light and refreshing. I've been using Tabac for over 40 years now. I was introduced to the cologne when I was stationed in Germany during my tour of duty in the Military. Great stuff guys, get it."
5,INTERESTING STUDY,"It is very interesting to read a this kind of book for us Japanese. However, as far as I know, we don't have a religious prejudice to homosexuality at all, therefore it sounds a little bit strange that in Meiji-era the goverment of Japan made a ""Sodomy Law"" imitating the western countries (though directly from the Manchurian China/Qing)---- of course it was soon repealed.I prefer to read a book on male/male love of pre-Tokugawa period, since in those days, especially in Muromachi/Azuchi-Momoyama-period, male homoeroticism was most flourished and prosperous.And I also want to read about the history of male-love in Korea, Tibet and Southeastern Asia."
4,Very easy & gives that extra storage space,I recently purchased & installed my new Suncast ACS24 corner shelves (I bought 4). Very easy to install! Wish they were a bit deeper but they sure help with storage space.
3,"Did not fit correctly in my 7x7 shed, and they can break easily.","This is a sturdy little shelf when assembled, but it did not fit correctlyin my 7x7 shed.Looking at the Amazon photo of the shelf:1. When I installed the right bracket, the bottom tab broke off.2. The center bracket installed perfectly.3. The left bracket installed perfectly.4. When installing the shelf, the right and center brackets snapped in place without issue, but the shelf was about 1/4"" too long for the right bracket to snap in place. I was forced to use a wire cutter to remove some additional plastic from the shelf before it would lay (it would no longer snap) in place properly.Going back to number one. A tab also broke off of a second bracket I tried mounting in the right position. I cut my loses and let the bracket rest in place on the remaining top tab and the remnants of the bottom tab.We were able to pile a lot of stuff on the shelves, and they seem sturdy when assembled, but they do have issues."
3,nice but narrow,If you have the shed this is a must have. It is a little narrow but I suppose it has to be. There should be 4 included not just 2 for the price. Does not hold much.
4,Extensive overview,"Patrick Allit gives a thorough history of the way that religion has taken place in The United States since the second world war. Allit divides the text into different eras such as by time and theme. He makes sure to include different perspectives as it does not simply address majority religion. People of different ranges of life are represented. Allit keeps different religions and ethnic groups in his history of religion.Through the text Allit traces a history of the American people. It is interesting to see a history of a people through their religious activities. Rather than watching political, social , and cultural history in a vacuum here we see the interaction of people and their religion. Another thing I liked is that it brings into focus people and events that normally are not present. Allit supports his story with a lot of evidence from different areas."
4,One of only three.,So far as I know this is one of only three available films made about the Erie Canal .The best one was made by Canadians in September of 2001.
5,So Much Younger Than Today,"The second the Beatles step foot off the plane at JFK, the US was never the same. Here it the film that proves that statement .Captured in black and white are the sights and sounds of the Beatles in NYC in 1964. The highlights that gets this DVD repeated viewing is that all of the boy's songs performances from Ed Sullivan's really big show are included.What is sometimes forgotten in the history of the Beatles is that they were a hell of a live rock and roll band. After these performance on Sullivan we would never see the Beatles play like this again. The public view of John Paul George and Ringo goes from this moment in time , to Hard Days Night, which is a recreation of this moment . Then check out the opening shot of Help. It features the Beatles all dressed in black, not smiling and their eyes saying ""we are not the really Fab Four any more. Now thanks to this DVD we can relive our baby steps of Rock"
5,FINALLY FIRST RATE FOOTAGE OF THE SULLIVAN SHOWS,"This is a great opportunity to see the Beatles perform their most famous hits in February 1964. The documentary footage of their 1st visit was also excellent. i recommend it highly. My only gripe was the deletion of several performances they had given on the Ed Sullivan Show. From what i had seen on poor bootleg videos, at least 4 or 5 performances were left out ( admittedly of the same songs) However there is plenty of room on a VHS tape or DVD to have included all without compromise."
5,Beatles make history,"73 million viewers watched these guys perform live on Ed Sullivan, and even the crooks took a break! Who would've guessed??? I think this is one of the best documentaries ever made. You see their arrival at JFK airport, the subsequent media questioning, fans going nuts, and these guys just being themselves. It's a great view of all the hysteria and behind the scenes stuff that at the time no one really got to see except for a select few. The performances are taken from the Ed Sullivan shows of 1964, but the addition of the Washington, D.C. concert is an added bonus, as well as the hotel stay in Miami Beach. I own it and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes The Beatles. It's a piece of music history that I strongly recommend viewing. You won't be disappointed."
1,Disappointing.,"Spurred on by the other reviews, I was looking forward to this video. I sat down to watch it with my 12-year-old daughter, to proudly show her that the fab-four were, yes, much bigger than the Backstreet Boys. I was anticipating an energetic, fast-paced video. Boy, was I wrong. In a word, Yawn. This is one slow video, folks. The film-makers apparently felt that having inside-the-hotel access was too priceless to cut a second of footage. The result is endless sequences of the Beatles in rooms, and backseats of limos...on and on like the home-videos of people who don't know when to stop and move to the next scene. It was also a bit jarring, I'm afraid, to watch my heroes suck down what appeared to be about a pack an hour of cigarettes, though I suppose that's neither here nor there. Bottom line is that I wanted badly to like this movie, and revisit wonderful times, but it just dragged. Too bad. I shoulda bought Hard Day's Night."
4,Another Great DVD For BeatleFan!!!,This DVD is another ithem collector for BeatleFan great great songs live and footage form the night party and airport only the Ed Sullivan performans is see en the same name DVD The Ed Sullivan Show The Beatles but collection is collection great 80minutes of beatles scenes
4,ANYONE WHO LOVES THE BEATLES...,"This dvd is perfect for any beatles fan. It has many enjoyable moments and concerts. You also get a chance to see the fab four off stage, and having fun. Emphisizing one scene where they are at The Peppermint Lounge. Ringo gets on the dance floor. Once you see this film the first time, you'll be watching it over and over again. It is impossible to watch this ony a few times. I love this dvd. The only problem is that I wish it wasn't in black & white! Oh well. The picture quality is excellent otherwise. (Except when you watch the Extras.) Anyone who loves The Beatles NEEDS TO GET THIS! Whatever age you are, it's a must have!"
5,A piece of history,"A warning should be made about this video: this documentary is for those who understand the historical value of the footage. Sure, there are a lot of scenes of the Beatles in hotels, limousines, trains, etc. But isn't it wonderful that a movie camera was there to capture it all? And there is even a candid scene of George creating some weird noises in his acoustic guitar, anticipating the Indian-influenced, experimental music he would make in the late 60's. This video is NOT for the casual Beatles fan who wants to show his daughter that they were better than the Backstreet Boys. But it is certainly the most generous collection of Beatles footage ever released on home video! And the television appearances are the icing on the cake!"
5,An essential piece of music history,"A very-well documented history of the Beatles first trip to the US! Surprisingly, the video and audio are very good for being over 35 years old. Although I'm not a fan of MPI Home Video's quality from what I've seen so far, this is one of the better ones (although they didn't Q/A the trivia game). Beatles fans need this -- and so do all fans of music history -- 'cuz this is it: almost an hour and a half of the real-life Beatles, their humor, their charm, and their wonderful music."
4,compelling film about a baseball star and his domineering father,"i found this inspired by true events movie based on the life of JimmyPiersall,baseball player for the Boston Red Sox to be quitecompelling.it charts his life(briefly)as a boy with a love for baseballand dreams of making the big leagues.he plays the game from high schoolleague up,all the while being criticized by his Father for not beinggood enough and having it drilled into his head that nothing he does isgood enough.even making the big leagues doesn't solves his problems.Anthony Perkins plays young Jimmy Piersall as an adult and Karl Maldenplays his father.Perkins puts in a terrific performance.for me,FearStrikes Out is a 4/5"
2,Fear Strikes Out Grounds Out,"""Fear Strikes Out"" is a melodramatic, miscast, muddy, musty baseball movie loosely based on Jimmy Piersall's real-life experience with bipolar disorder. It appears I'm in the minority here, but I don't agree that this is a complex psychological drama. After repeated viewings, I don't think I learned anything about bipolar disorder, and the subject criticized the film for overblaming his father. Also, I disagree with the view that the movie wasn't melodramatic. Climbing the backstop while shrieking is overemotional unless it really happened, which it didn't. Take way the psychological drama and you're left with the baseball scenes, which Jimmy Piersall said were laughable. The theme of fathers trying to live out their dreams in their kids is an important one, but I don't think time or real life have been kind to the way this movie deals with it."
5,Related,The true story of Jimmy Piersall is great. I think His purpose in life was to take the awful stigma and bad name off mental business. He is also my granddaughter's Greatgrandfather.
1,stinks rotten fish,"boy, oh, boy they really blew the hell outta this franchise and they shouldnt of made this movie at all. Angelina is really annoying in this part, its antiedupped by the butler who is played by Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie who portrays Rimmer on the show, he is the only thing likable in this fishy smelling film. the action scenes are a yawn and the ending with that globe thing is just a total waste of my time. its dead in the water for me"
1,One of the worst movies ever....,"I've seen hunderds of movies over the years, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I was bored with plot and the acting wasn't much better. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie was Jolie who looked great during the movie. Other than this avoid this movie at all cost and I regret giving my hard earned money to watch this."
2,Lara should take some Lessons in Humility,"There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel. Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard."
4,"If you play the video games, you'll like this","I know the professional reviewers thought this movie was awful, but since I have played several of the Tomb Raider video games, I enjoyed it for what it was, a video game come to life. Angelina Jolie really captured Croft. The sets were very similar to video game levels. Jolie pretty much had to perform the same kind of stunts to get out of the scene as you do to get off the level. It was exciting to see the character I have manipulated so many hours on my computer come to life. And seeing a big-breasted woman firing big guns, swinging on ropes or leaping over cars on a motorcycle....well, that's just hot. What more can you want? Plot? Don't be silly. It had a plot. Find this shiny thing. Same plot as the video games. That's plenty plot."
4,Great movie,"The movie is great, it has action, and a great storyline. I am in love with all of the Tomb Raider games, and I love this movie as well.Pros:1) Great storyline2) Storyline like the game3) Takes twists and turns in the plotlineCons:1) Could have been better"
1,It [stinks].,"First off, I just wanted to say that this movie [stinks]. Maybe it was all the bad reviews that I read that detered me from liking it, but I stopped watching it 30 minutes through. That's how bad it was. Stay away from it and if you must, rent it first."
1,I so wanted to like this...,"It is a shame, but this was so bad it makes you want to cringe. I even think that the heroine might have some talent, but one does like plot, and to be quite honest mid-way through this drivel, I did not care what was going to happen next.The good news for the producers is that the sequel cannot be worse."
3,Was it better than the video game?,"Since I've never played the video game, I don't know if the movie was better or worse. The plot was a bit weak, but I think that's because the majority of the budget went to special effects.The physical attributes (is it real or memorex?) of Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft aside, tomb raiding has a sort of mystical draw for audiences. Although no one will ever be able to replace Indiana Jones, many will make the attempt, including this movie.Fortunately, for Indiana Jones, his title is safe."
3,Tomb Raider,I thought this movie could be alot worst when I saw previews of it. I think Angelina Jolie was really beautiful in this film. She looks better with a little weight on her. This movie had a terrible script but there were parts of it I liked. Like the begginning. I wouldnt reccomend buying this movie before you rent it.
1,Late Night Sinamax Is Better,"I watched this at the movies. I've played all of the Tomb Raider games. The games were new and innovative for their time, even though they became repetitive with each new installment. This movie should be called ""Angelina Jolie - Tomb Raider"". I like Angelina Jolie don't get me wrong, but most the production money must have been spent on Angelina Jolie and the FX. Then they picked up some B-rated cheap-o guy to write it. Buy a better movie like one of the Indiana Jones or The Mummy. At least those movies have a better plot."
2,What a waste!,"I saw this movie in the theaters this summer and it was such a bummer. I could not belive that someone would approve such a lousy script and make it into an equally lousy movie. My suggestion is to rent this before you buy. If you haven't seen it, watch it first. Don't buy it until you have sat through it once because you will just winding up hating yourself for wasting the money on it! I hope that if they make a follow up it is much better and not full of plot holes and bad fx's!"
4,No Raiders Of The Lost Ark but a fun film.,"This film by Simon West is no Raiders Of The Lost Ark but you have to admit Angelina looks fit enough to be in WWF, interms of seeing a lifeless video game charachter that only youcontrol Angelina's presence is welcomed no doubt she looks andis Laura Croft in this film in a film that really dosen't giveanything but a fun summer popcorn flick , but then again so wasRaiders.Angelina underwent some brutal training and did almostall of her own stunts , her father John Voight makes a cameoin the film but is not really top brass in this but don't takemy word for it judge for yourself this is only my opinon it'sa really fun film and if you like the mummy films , IndianaJones film you will love Tomb Raider hang on and enjoy."
4,Angelina IS Lara Croft,"Okay, the first time I saw this movie I felt it lacked plot and character development, but it was visually stunning none the less. I liked it much better the second time around. Tomb Raider could be the next Indiana Jones, so too bad Lucas/Spielberg didn't direct it. Angelina Jolie is right on the money in terms of the look and feel of the character. Any problem with this film is not her fault. And when all is said and done, it was worth the price of admission just to watch her...........she is easy on the eyes! I play Tomb Raider all the time and I feel she was excellent. I just wish they would have made more scenes resemble the game or let her pick up a medpack and say ""Ah, ha"". I do plan to buy this DVD."
4,"Not bad, especially for a 'video game' movie...","This movie, while admittedly lacking in aspects of character development, provided an overall enjoyable action ride. The stunt work was awesome, and the cinematography/special effects weren't bad either. I actually liked the absuridity of the plot, as a student of archaeology, in that it provided a nice fantasy, and didn't confuse too much fact with fiction (though I loved the Indy movies, they didn't do much to help the cause of true archaeologists to educate the public on matters ancient). And, really, the absuridity of this movie is no less than that of 'Temple of Doom' (a Thuggee temple? come on...). I'd say it was more realistic in many ways.... All in all, it was an enjoyable movie. If you're a fan of the games, or stunt-filled action flicks, buy it. If not, rent it anyway. Hey, it's better than 'The Mummy Returns'... (I'd even argue, better than ToD)."
4,"Jolie, Action, & Gadgets","Everything is seductive, here....even though this movie is based on the action packed video game. Lady Craft's role in finding the past, in stopping the bad guy is seduction in itself. The movie starts with her, weapons in hand, dueling, jumping, and kicking a spider-like machine that has been programmed to kill her. This is how she trains. We move on to thieves trying to steal a time machine that her father found. The sequencing of moves, the tricky gadgets, the wicked dancing Buddha in the tomb in Cambodia, the trek to the Artic, the gigantic time machine that slices and dices..... Lady Croft sure handles all of these frolicking adventures with cool wit and grace. Excellent cinematography shows all of these journeys, one following the other. The only thing I found a tad disappointing is the dialogue: bland and undeveloped. But with Jolie in the midst, who is listening? If you like the video games, you'll like this movie."
2,Time Raider,"After watching this film, I never want to hear anybody complain about Battlefield Earth again. I do not understand how this movie escaped public criticism.The story and script are pretty bad. The filming and editing make you feel like you are watching a two hour mountain dew comercial. The ony cool thing are the scenes of Angor Wat. People under twelve may enjoy this film, but others will find themselves scratching their heads."
2,What can you expect?,I guess you can't really expect much from a movie based on a video-game. There are plenty of fanciful actions scenes (how do they always seem to miss point-blank with automatic weapons?...) but not much of a plot to speak of. Silly story; sub-par movie.Not recommended.
1,More like (...) Raider,"Rather than create a legitimate action/adventure film, Simon West gave movie-goers the softest form of porn available. Why is there a shower scene in there? Is he selling shampoo?I think the same pre-teen gameboy nerdboys that go to see this movie were actually the same people the made the movie. Could they never get enough of watching silicone jiggling? ""Hey guys, let's put another slow-motion running shot of Angelina running into the camera."" I bet they're working on the Tomb Raider swimsuit edition right now.To everyone who bought this DVD... do us a big favor and place it under a nice fat elephant (...). That's where you'll find Simon West working up his next big hit."
4,great work,i love this movie. It just works. Jolie did a good job and i love the end where shes visit her father's grave in the end wearing a cute white dress and hate. It's like mad max meets wonderwoman.
2,Not much resemblance to the video game character,"Tomb Raider the movie failed to be hardly anything like Tomb Raider the video game. Lara Croft in the video game is dressed in brown and green clothes, Lara Croft in the movie is dressed in all black.Also, in the video game, she's just about always in tombs. In the movie, she hardly ever was in any tombs, and that movement of manuvers she did at the beggining of the movie in the tomb to make it seem as if it's the video game come to life expect for her black clothes, that was quickly over after only a few minutes and it was only in her backyard in her mansion where she practices.She is a very sexy woman, though. (...)Angelina Jolie's sexieness was the only good thing about Tomb Raider the movie, and again, if they were trying to make it as resembling to the video game as possible, then like that older movie Super Mario Bros., they didn't do so good."
3,"21st century Indiana Jones, with a braid","Most of the sets were great, I also liked many of the stunts and special effects but not really a great movie. I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, didn't think they were great either, and found this one to be very similar in nature although perhaps more oddly paced. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft might actually be better than Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones but really you're getting Indiana with a braid and an accent. It's O.K. to spend a couple of hours with but not deeply satisfying."
1,3 1/2 Star Average? Moral: T&A can disguise a bad movie,"A friend brought this movie over the other day. Let me sum this movie up.1) Angelina Jolie gets in a new outfit and slinks around to techno music for 5 minutes.2) Rinse, repeat.Throw in a shower scene to distract the audience from the fact that if they cut out all of the slow motion catwalk clothes modeling the movie would be 30 minutes shorter.The best part was when they do the same slow motion techno blah blah when they are showing the tomb raiding convoy drive across a frozen tundra in their jeeps."
3,Fun Movie!,"I loved the action and huge detailed sets!My nits were with the time storms- dog jumps through one and is seen as skin and bones while going through. Lara throws the clock and it hangs suspended in the time bubble. Newton's first law doesn't apply to mystical clocks? Lara puts her hand in there to grab a piece of the tringle and isn't skin and bones while there.I can suspend my disbelief for natty larger than life action sequences where her clothes are always clean and neat and well fitted while tossing around bad guys, but ???"
4,Check Your Brain at the Door and Have Fun,"""Tomb Raider""--the movie--is just what the previews indicated it would be: ""Indiana Jones"" with curves. Lara Croft, the clever, gun-toting heroine is fun to watch as she tracks down pieces of an artifact that will enable the possessor to control time. The combination of having to solve interesting puzzles and kicking butt makes this a cut above the typical action movie. Her hunt takes us around the globe as she races against an astronomical deadline and the obligatory bad guys who also seek the artifact. Angelina Jolie makes Lady Croft a lot of fun.Although I'm not usually a fan of chase-scene-followed-by-explosions movies, I truly enjoyed ""Tomb Raider."" In fact, I became so hooked that I bought the video game--something else that I usually don't do."
2,"Angelina Jolie, great actress...","she is definitely perfect for the role of Lara Croft, and she did a fantastic job in the movie...and I'm not even a fan of hers.BUT, BUT, BUT...all the other actors in this movie just couldn't keep up with her. They fail to support her role. In the end, I was dissappointed with the movie because coz of all the bad acting from them."
1,Viewing this film took 5 minutes!!,"Five minutes into this [...]is all it took to see how badly the film companies are trying to set up a new franchise picture.But this was unwatchable... and what's with the English accent, Angelina.?Forgeddabout it.....don't even rent it, it's so bad."
3,POPCORN TIME!!,"There isn't a lot of plot to this movie, but it's still the best movie I've seen so far that's based on a video game. Great stunts and Angelina Jolie is sexy. This ought to keep action fans happy until INDIANA JONES 4 gets made."
4,"""I Woke Up This Morning And Just Hated Everything"" ~ A Pleasurable Torment Indeed","In '01 the immensely popular video game featuring the voluptuous, computer generated Lara Croft was transformed into a major Hollywood film starring the extremely sexy Angelina Jolie, The film `Lara Croft - Tomb Raider' is a slick, tongue-in-cheek action/adventure ala Indiana Jones that succeeds in entertaining its audience with exotic locations, superior special effects, numerous action sequences and the lovely Angelina Jolie to keep the viewer focused. The dialogue is also well thought out containing lots of memorable little quips one can store away for personal use at a later date.Lots of fun provided for a high energy evening so fasten your seat belts!"
5,awesomest movie ever!!,I bought this this febuary and it was great it camw in 3 days i opened the package and it was as good as new no scratches or anything it was a great movie!!!
1,Watching This is Absolute Loss of Time,"Isn't it amazing to watch the depth of stupidity of Hollywood produced mass market movies?! Angelina Jolie is starring in this fabulous example of one of these brainless Hollywood creatures. While searching for hidden artifacts in Asian rainforest and Siberian taiga, the Tomb Raider lacks absolutely everything necessary to make even a parody on Indiana Jones type action. The plot is messy, old and lacks originality. The main heroes lack characters. Even majority of computer game fans has reportedly been also disappointed.It is not a rewarding task to write such a negative review. However, watching Angelina Jolie in a summer shirt under unbuttoned coat in Siberia does not go any further than [breasts] watching anywhere in an office or on the street, but the latter is absolutely free and less time consuming.The only good thing worth mentioning is the good visual effects, although the volume of them seems to emphasize the lack of real actors' play."
1,Some things should stay Video Games,"I found Tomb Raider most dissipointing, but then I didn't expect too much either.This movie made the Mummy look like very good Non-Fiction... The single bright spot was the sound. They made good use of the Surround Sound, the main motivator for me renting this movie (to test out my new home theater set-up).If you can't stay clear of this movie, rent it first and save yourself a couple bucks!"
1,"Stupid movie, but Jolie is hot","This had to be one of the silliest, most predictable, lowbrow movies I've ever seen. That said, I have to say that if you can withstand the barrage of bad plot choices, badly scripted lines, complete lack of any serious emotion, Angelina Jolie is definitely a cutie.Unfortunately, I can't lower myself to seeing a movie simply because the lead actress is hot. Most people can, I suppose, and that's cool. Personally, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie.I do hope I see Jolie in many movies in the future, though."
3,Sad but True!!!!,"Tombraider has always been an inspiration for game players around the world, being Laura the center of attention, her cunning will, and spicy attitude is what made her famous, In the Tombraider movie the casting director did an excellent job when choosing Angelina joli her role of Laura was beyond words, however I can't say the same for the writers, I mean what where they thinking when they wrote the story? I mean did they even have writers to begin with? maybe the producers got cheap and thought they could write it themselves. it was terrible, they could have done so much with the movie. I had been waiting 3 years for this movie to come out, and now im sorry I did."
5,Great plot. Great action,"This a super good movie. Angelina Jolie makes a great Lara Croft. The extensive plot captivates viewers of all ages. The people claiming to think this movie is garbage must have had their eyes closed or saw a different movie because what I saw was pure exhileration, action, and of course pure Lara Croft(Angelina Jolie). What else could you need in a movie. This movie is not what all the critics think it is, for it is an awesome movie with a great actress and wondreful plot. I'd be willing to pay double price if that were my only option to see it again. If I were you, I'd go and see the movie if you haven't already and then you go and say what you think. You could think I'm a blabbing idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about or you could agree with me that this movie needs to be reconsidered for an Academy Award. This is a great movie and everyone should see it."
2,More butchery from Hollywood,"It's obvious from the get go that whoever owns the creative rights to Tomb Raider the game, had no say so in what went into the movie. I don't know everything about the game, but what I do know is that in Lara Croft's bio for the game, she was raised by a rich family, and put through finishing school. So, she IS a lady, unlike the movie makes her butch and tomboyish. Next, she was disowned and made her own fortune. So on and so forth. Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but this movie had just plain bad direction. Even great athletes need good coaches. The other performances are on par for a free-for-all cheese fest. All I can say is I hope these aren't the same people doing Resident Evil, or that they're not planning to do a Duke Nukem movie."
3,Angelina Lights Up the Screen,"When Angie is on-screen you can't take your eyes off her. The sexy heroine does what she can with what she has to work with, but it is a helpless effort. Tomb Raider serves to be unrealistic, even for a movie based on a video game. For example: why doesn't Lara Croft just destroy the clock once she has found it so that the other pieces of the triangle are useless? Angelina is magnificant and the accent is spectacular, but you cannot ignore the obvious, Tomb Raider was the bomb of the summer."
3,Could've been better...,"I was slightly disappointed with Tomb Raider. The aspects leaned toward being unrealistic with over the top action. I don&#65533;t mind a sub realistic plot like the alignment of the planets and an ancient time device that can be utilized for good or evil, but lets the make the physical abilities of the characters a little more realistic. I know Laura is an asskicking relic hunter and I really enjoyed watch Jolie bring her to life, but I would like a hint of believability. The scene where her arm is healed by a Buddhist is almost useless. If her entire body had been damaged or she was near death, this scene would have been more striking. But it was almost unnecessary. The movie is an entertaining adventure and hopefully if they make a sequel, they will work on the script and story. Jolie certainly has expressed immediate interest but hopefully she will stick to her word and stand fast to her desire for a better script."
1,Game Over,"I should make it clear that I do not play video games though I can't imagine players ever fall asleep in the middle of play. The same cannot be said for this film. Actually I wish I had slept through parts because the end result was the same. Missing a crucial plot point or scene would have explained my confusion during and in the end. Instead I left scratching my head and tired wondering what happened and why.Angelina Jolie probably offers up a great personification of Lara Croft and the action is interesting at times. But if you are not a die hard junky of Play station, this is a waste of time, confusing and surprisingly slow moving. Don't get sucked in.mdMichael Durankowww.bootism.com"
2,"jolie is great, tomb raider is not...","ok, lemme just say i like angelina jolie (girl interrupted, pushing tin, both were great) and she totally looks and acts the part of lara croft. and ive played the game and most (lol) of its sequels and its a great game. however!, i was very dissappointed in the storyline (which tries to be clever too much) and dialogue that is just terrible! the action wasnt that great either (except for a few impressive scenes). another thing, i didnt think the soundtrack was up to par either, same with the camerawork, it seemed like the cinematographer was content with stationary shots 80% of the time. anyways i was really hoping this movie to be really good, but somehow it got botched up..."
4,"Low expectations, pleasant surprise","I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film but am always willing to give Angelina Jolie a chance. No the film wasn't great but it was a heck of a lot better than I expected. The cinematography and action scenes were original and interesting. The site locations for the movie were beautiful and different. The acting was pretty good. If you are having trouble figuring out what to watch, check this out. It's not great, but it's far from bad. I think you'll be surprised."
2,wha?,"Have our standards for movies dropped so far that movies like this one can be made... and succeed? What were they thinking, other than ""hey, let's make a buck?"" Why would Jolie, who's done a lot better roles in her career (even snagged an Oscar for ""Girl, Interrupted""), risk her good name?This movie is a derivative of most every action movie ever made, namely the Indiana Jones chronicles. It's good enough for the eye candy, I guess, but if you want to see a ""fun"" movie with a lot of action, pick up ""The Mask of Zorro"" or even ""The Mummy"" instead. This one tried too hard to be trendy and will be hopelessley dated in five years."
2,mindless,"I can't reveal key elements of the plot; it doesn't have one.The only saving grace is that it comes to an end, which for mewas less than twenty minutes; thank god for remote control stopbuttons.This movie must have been produced by idiots for more of the same. To like this flick requires that your brain be the sizeof a pea."
5,Excellent!,Widescreen and complete high definition! So glad I finally got this movie on dvd. Excellent quality. If you're a fan of the film then buy it!
1,Unbelievabaly Stupid,I think that this movie won the number one for stupidity all year. I actually fell asleep. Don't waste time or money pass this by.
1,Even Angelina in Skin Tight Tops Can't Help,"Yes, though the beautful Angelina Jolie romps through most of the film in skin tight tops staying true to the Lara Croft of Tomb Raider video game fame (with the exception of a wholly unnecessary shower scene), it's not nearly enough to save this horrid mass of dreck. Even the incredible special effects are wasted in a hodge-podge of slice-n-dice editing that makes it impossible for all but those with ADD to follow. The story is senseless and the ending hokey as it comes...Don't waste the money unless you are a die hard fan of the game or Mrs Billy Bob...and really not even then!"
1,"This one fall short, real short...","I went to see this movie with my dad and my brother, I believe we were thinking the same thing, a female Indiana Jones, we were wrong, way wrong. First off the action scenes, I don't really know what this new directing style is of putting 100 or so cameras in a room and switching camera ever second or two, it was going so fast I almost threw up my pop and popcorn. Is that what they wanted me to do? I hope not. Another thing, in Indiana Jones, no matter which one you pick, almost every 15 minutes he's running into another problem... Stay away from this, do yourself a favor."
1,junk - but at least it is pure and genuine junk,"If anything would prove that most films based on comic book or computer game characters are rarely worth a jot of concentration, this one should. This film is terrible on every level - wooden acting, silly stunts that are obviously computer-enhanced, and the most flaccid plot you could imagine, just pure formula garbage. The worst.Don't bother, unless you want to vegatate and wallow in mindless pap. There is nothing to recommend this film, not even you-know-who's computer exaggerated chest."
1,On the blu-ray release,"When the Lara Croft video game was released it was so ahead of its time, it influenced and changed the video game industry.It would have been nice if the Lara Croft series could continue its revelutionary approach by producing a crystal clear version of this 7 year old movie. But seeing the way how they prepared the title for HD, its apparent that the producers dont have big expectancies from this old lady.The movie is very much grainy, there are even scratches and glares. I am not impressed with the audio as well.The HD version has absolutely Zero upgrade value.There are many extras but as i dont have the DVD im not sure if they are special for this version or not."
2,Doesn't make the cut.,"I have played all the games (including Angel of Darkness-yuck), and I am a big fan of Tomb Raider and hottie Angelina Jolie. So when I went to the theatre I was excited. But now...First of all, this has nothing to do with any Tomb Raider storyline, and never should have anything to do with it. A clock and poor Laura's daddy? Who cares??? This is not the Laura that fans know! Although Angelina makes a good Laura, she would be way better if not based on a video game. The only good fighting scene is the mansion. The rest...sucks.I have this on VHS. I was gonna get in on DVD but...Why Bother?A good movie to...Pass time.Oh, and another good scene is...Shower Scene.When there is an unrated version released...I'll buy it.Until that day, though...screw it."
5,An perfect Tomb Raider,"This film has everything, drama, love, action, betrayal and more. It's the best film. Angelina jolie was born to be Lara Croft. If you want more info on the film or if you are interested in the Angelina Jolie Newsletter or tomb raider Newsletter e-mail me at jj_025@lycos.com"
5,Better than The Mummy Returns!,"This is the best movie Ive ever seen!If you thought the Mummy was good,then you will love this one!This movie has a lot of adventure.I have the video game and I still dont get it but the movie is off the hook!I cant wait till it comes out on DVD!Believe me,you have to see this movie!Is a great movie for everyone and kids too cause it has No sexual content,and thats something parents worry about.Its defenetly worth seen this movie.And your kids will defenetly love it and teens too!Angelina Jolie did a great job.After seen this movie, she became one of my favorite actresses.If you liked her in this movie,then you should check out ORIGINAL SIN,where she also starts,but this one not apropiate for kids cause its got strong sexual content.But is also good!Thats about all!"
2,disappointing blu-ray release,"this is my 10th blu-ray movie, and it is one of the worst one I have seen, there is grain everywhere and colors are so saturated it made the picture look flat and plain. Definitely not for showing off your HD equipment."
2,Worst Blu ray I have seen.,There isn't much I can say about this disk except it is the worst looking blu ray disc I have seen. This is really grainy looking. Full Metal Jacket which is 20 years older than this looks better.
3,Good but not great,This was an ok movie but not the best.It had great action and great skill and followed a good stroy lnie till the end.The end I didn't get at all.I thought it was stupid and still I didn't get it.If you get movies like this then get it.But if your like me and you don't get it at all then don't get it.Alaso it's just a bit of a money waste.
2,Great Effects...Lousy Story,That about sums it up...I think we are seeing WAY too many of these post-Indiana Jones movies...
3,Movie Trailers are Missing,"Compares to other recent popular releases (e.g. Shrek, Star Wars - Episode I, Mummy Returns, etc.), this release from Paramount is a bit more pricey. Other companies are putting out 2-DVD sets with plenty of supplements and are all competitively priced. In Tomb Raider's case, it is just a 1-DVD set and the movie trailers are conspicuously missing from the package.Video & audio qualities are not demonstration quality but nontheless very satisfactory. Looks like Paramount needs to increase the value factor in order to catch up with what are offered by Warner and Dreamsworks and the likes."
5,Super cool!!!,"I can't say enough good things. I promis not to make this too boring. But it was a really good movie. I liked the story eventough there could of been more puzzles, it was really good. it has funny parts too. But the acton is great and I her that the DVD has some cool speasil featuresthats it."
1,Dull,"Excluding some rather cool special effects, the whole of this movie was DULL and BORING. The plot was confusing -- a hodgepodge of standard pseudo-mystical elements brought out of some attic trunk.Unless you're just turned on by a rather busty Angelina Jolie, I suggest you save your money."
4,Amazing,"Tomb raider was a fun action packed movie. The casting was great and the small cameos and touches were of good effect. Angelina Jolie truely fit this feisty character of computerized fiction. I loved the grace of her stunts and the pull of the other actors on her. Small roles such as the butler were to be applauded, they gave us small insight on her character and a good laugh as well. All around the storyline kept me interested and I was twice as entranced as I was by just playing the game. I would reccomend seeing this movie if only for quick peek into a computer game that was transformed wonderfully."
3,Worth A Watch,"This movie is worth the watch but not a good storyline at all because she could have destroyed that part of the triangle and it would have ended it right there but no they had to keep it going anyways it had okay special effects it looks worse on TV than it did in the movie theatres. The DVD is okay but nothing spectacular. this movie is worth a watch but i can't watch this movie after one time, it annoys me."
3,Tomb Raider,"This movie was not as well planned out as it should have been, the directors should have put more thought into it.Due to the cheesy story lines I would have to rate this movie 3 stars. The action scenes are pretty good and the fact that Angelina Jolie does pretty much all of her own stunts, I would advise renting it on the ... shelf."
2,There's a difference between good and enjoyable...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as it was visually appealing and had an, uh, interesting plot. I did find myself laughing at some of the more predictable scenes though. However the cheesy accents, horrible script, and a very cliched villain are just a few of the good many things wrong with this movie. All in all, I think this a really bad movie, but nonetheless enjoyable. A screenplay like this sounds good in theory, but video game-to-movie transfers take more than just a large budget."
3,Decent Croft,"Lara Croft, the first woman Indiana Jones, is up against a holy revelation that requires some stern kicking. Angelina Jolie plays the video game ... kicker and is the best actress to have been picked for the part. Although there are some plot cliches, the movie does have some tense action scenes which will please most fans. Seriously, she needs to forget about her father (played by Jon Voight) and kick more ... . Get Van Damme to be in the next one and you'll have rich chocolate. Forget the robots and swinging on a big totem pole, fight a huge guy like Dolph Lundgren!"
5,Worth Seeing again.,I loved the action in this moivie. No one could make a better Tomb Raider than Angelina Jolie. I mean there was action and some funny parts in this movie. I can't wait for Tomb Raider and the Cradle of Life to come out.
2,Overhyped,The action scenes were okay at best but the plot is awful. Overhyped movie. Rent it at Blockbuster Video only if your friend is paying.
2,Disappointment for Tomb Raider fans,"If you play tomb raider video games, then this movie will be a disappointment for you. They had Lara Croft together all the way in look, but failed to work on script and plot. This movie had the potential to be good, but didn't come out that way.It seemed like it was thrown together. Should of been longer.If you like tomb raider video games, then don't except this movie to be really good."
1,Bad Fighing movie!,"This movie was PURE HYPE. It's not a very good fighting action-movie, and a waste of money. Try John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars it's 100 times better than this movie."
2,How'd they botch this one so badly?,"Ok. I knew what I expected when I saw the trailer: Indiana Jones in a D-cup. Problem is, there's no real story here. The writing is horrible, and the directing is pathetic. About the only thing going for it is Angelina Jolie, who at least looks interesting. Unfortunately, nothing she did could save the movie, and I felt embarrassed for her when watching it. You might want to see this one before buying it. Don't say you weren't warned..."
3,good special effects,"I watched it in hindi? I think so didn't understand a word. Lots of action. I enjoyed it, but added my own soundtrack, so not sure what the original movie is like. Angelina Jolie looked good - and the did the butt kicking, borderline psychopath Lara Croft very well I thought.I eat men for breakfast. And laugh.She's got the whole sexy, booby thing downpat, but still quite likeable as a character. I will fry your testicles, with onions and sauce. And you will like it.I haven't seen the second one but I'm looking forward to it. Treasure hunt, monsters - adventure/fantasy. Strong, female lead. What's not to like.Daniel Craig plays her love interest, and does it really well (from the looks of it.) Tragic and loveable."
4,4 not a 5,This film looked and sounded great. It was an Angelina Jolie movie but it just wasn't what I expected. I come from the time were Lara Croft was controlled by your fingure tips so I don't think they captured my Lara Croft Tomb Raider. It is still a film I have seen in standard and own in HD. The HD looks great. The film itself just didn't do it for me. They really didn't capture the essence of Tomb Raider.
2,Huge Disappointment,"There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only"
3,Good acting by Jolie,The best in movie added to the special effects and intense action are Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight.The movie suffers from spetacular scenes based in The Matrix and lacks on more romanticism and more erotica that should be the needs of Tomb Raider fans.Good interior and exteriors filmed in locations on Cambodia.Good entertainment.
1,Unsatisfactory DVD,"Although the DVD was brand new, it would not play a) on four different DVD players in my home or b) on the DVD drives on three different computers. It was a total and frustrating disappointment, and I will not purchase any more such items online again.H C Jones MD"
2,Bouncing breasts,Not a bad movie but not very good either. The accents are bad and the plot worse. If you want to see plenty of bouncing breast then you won't be disappointed. But if you expect more from a movie then watch something else.
3,not as good as I remember,"I watched it after many years, and I remembered it being better. Could that be due to the novelty factor?"
3,A lot of absurd noise,"I suppose the special effects are ok here. I just don't get too excited about these types of films. This was a 2001 vehicle for the then slightly less famous Angelina Joli whose main claim to fame here are her enormous breasts and overly plumped fish lips. She is not a bad actress, really, but you would think she would opt for slightly more cerebral films. I guess she likes money. Poor Daniel Craig has nothing whatsoever to do here pre-James Bond. If you are 15, or have the maturity of the same, then you may enjoy this silliness."
2,Lara should still take some Lessons in Humility,"Lighten up Lara. There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel.Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard."
3,Have seen better.....,"The first thought that I had in watching this movie was: this must be the attempt at a feminine edition of Indiana Jones. Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie just isn't very convincing. Granted, the story was pretty good. The idea of the Illuminati wanting to take over the world through the Triangle of Life seems good enough. However, what really did this movie in was the special effects, or lack thereof. Everything felt sooo....""video-gamish"". It was so predictable. Croft would find objects so easily, and then from out of nowhere, would be monsters that she would have to fight and annihilate....and she would....then move on to the next adventure. It just seemed that the flow of the movie was so predictable....it really hurt the story's credibility. Don't get me wrong, if you are in the mood for a good romp...then by all means watch this movie. Just don't expect an intellectual thriller. Indiana Jones is a much better series for that kind of thing. Just sit back and ENJOY this one!"
3,Has Everything a Teenage Boy Needs,"Well Angelina Jolie did it again, she fulfilled her goal of making a complete badass chick sexy, which isnt very easy mind you. I mean how often is it that you see a badass look good, like never.Anyway Tomb Raider, the first movie is a little well to much like the game. I mean you have nothing really to look forward for, that is the difficulty about remaking a story you dont really know how to do itThe first movie is about lara croft completing her fathers work in making a way to go back in time. But you know how it is, competetors bad guys, swinging from the ceiling, kicking swat team ass, same old same old.I thought this movie had no chance but it sort of did so it was a little suprising, watch this then the sequel."
2,Didn't seem believable,I love Angelina Jolie but I just don't buy into her being able to beat up 10 men without a single scratch on her body.She also does not do enough acrobatic moves in this moves. At the beginning she does a flip from a rope. That flip looked very foney.Her lines are way too brief. Her conversations with the other actors take one minute or less.
3,It was okay,"I would recommend this movie, but it wasnt exactly what I would call Great! I loved the Tomb Raider games and the previews looked amazing so I thought I would try it. Yes, the special effects were good but the plot wasnt good and the ending pretty much blew in my opinion. It was over too quick. But I would still recommend it. Try it and see if you like it!"
1,0 Stars,"For a long time I wanted to see this movie and two nights ago I watched it on DVD... and I was terribly disappointed!This movie lacks all elements of a movie. I see they only used Angelina Jolie to attract audience. The over use of action & CGI is very poor and insulting. The story is very shallow and weak and everything else is as bad.I thought this movie would be ""Indiana Jones"" of 2001. But it is not! This movie was rated for audience above 13 years old. I am afraid they made a mistake, it should be for audience less than 13 years old."
1,"angelina, angelina, angelina....","what were you thinking? It is becoming consistent that the winner of best supporting actress at the Oscars, comes out with a really bad movie. I am not a fan of the game nor this movie.She is a very talented actress, and I am disappointed that she is in this video game/movie. Maybe you need to be a fan of the game, and totally obsessed with it or her to appreciate this movie. I thought it was really lame, and it put me to sleep in about twenty minutes.While there may be alot of great action sequences in this movie, there is no plot. Just Jolie in some sexy lingerie.Only for fans of game..."
1,Horrible...,"The movie has absolutely no tie to the video game besides the title. The script is horrible, special effects are cheesy, the only thing that attracted people to watch this movie is Jolie's figure.I was really looking forward to this movie, but I ended up sleeping for about 25 minutes during the movie. There were about 2 good action scenes, and thats about it.Never the less, I'm going to buy this movie anyway, only because Jolie looks awsome is the movie, in any movie for that sake.For everyone else, I suggest to rent the movie."
2,Bad quality,I had the VHS version of this movie.I liked this movie because Angelina was in her peak years at that time.But buying this bluday was a mistake somehow.The quality is really really bad. Even worse than DVD.What can I say.IT's cheap and I can live with it.
5,iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiGREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Angelina Jolie rocks in both of the Tomb Raiders, but my personal favorite is 1. Though the second is great too, it Definitely tones down a bit as in hype. The first one's got everything from action to comedy. I definitely recommend this action flick to anyone who likes seeing bad guys and monsters getting their a-hole kicked...by a beautiful woman in tights."
3,Good action but nothing to be remembered.,"Tomb Raider is good fun and good for a rental. The Movie itself will eventually be forgotten. Angelina Jolie does good, and the plot it okay. The effects are good, as well as the settings. The movie is only okay. See it if you love action."
3,Half decent action yarn with great eye candy,"We all know Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but most of her acting talents are put aside in place of her other ""assets"" in this big screen adaption of the video game hit. Director Simon West (Con Air) directs with his usual big action packed style, but some parts of the film can be just mindnumbingly dull. Jolie is picture perfect as Lara Croft and is as beautiful as ever, but believe it or not her true acting talents could have brought so much more to the film, but the lacking script can be partly to blame on that. Jolie's real life father Jon Voight plays her late father in the film, and Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) is humerous as Lara's bumbling helper. All in all, those craving some mindless action with some gorgeous eye candy should give Tomb Raider a look."
3,What this movie means to me,"Hey I will not lie to you guys going to see this movie was a very fun experience. However it is the type of movie you can only go and see once before it becomes utterly worthless.This is the kind of movie you go to see(or rent)for the cars, the music and the frontal cookware of one Angelina Jolie.The best part about the movie was that my main man Rimmer(from Red Drawf) got a bit part."
3,poor quality,"Of the 6 BRD movies I own right now, I'm sorry to say this was the biggest disappointment. I had the movie on DVD already (and I'll let others deal with the movie as a movie). I played it back on my Sony 55"" SXRD via my PS3, and I was just taken back with how much graininess there was in this disc. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty and a beautiful movie -- better than the DVD... but the graininess of many of the scenes really did it in for me. It's not a bad movie to own, but if you're looking for stellar ""show off"" material, there are much better choices."
1,What the???,"I have never been so underwhelmed by a film. I'm glad I didn't fork over the cash to see it at the theater, because I'm sure I would have fallen asleep. At no point in this movie did I care one whit about Lara Croft or any other character. The ""action"" scenes seemed like they were in slow motion -- and not cool-effect slow motion, just not-at-all-exciting, I-can't-do-this-any-faster slow motion. I was really looking forward to Angelina Jolie as a tough action-heoine chick, but all I saw was a bunch of one-dimensional cartoon characters. Oh, and an overstuffed bra..."
4,Everything it was billed to be...,"Angelina looked great throughout!As for the plot - hmm - I can't seem to remember. Perhaps I'll have to view it again - a pleasant thought, but I suspect I'll have nothing further to add to this review afterwards. If given the choice of a flick to watch when being given a lobotomy, this would rate near the top of the list."
3,Not as bad as you think,"This movie gets a bad rep and it doesn't deserve it. Yes, it is an action flick and yes, the main attraction is Angelina Jolie in that outfit but for fans of action/science fiction this movie will satisfy. The action sequences are great and the special effects are top notch. The story isn't all that bad either. For fans of Indiana Jones, you absolutely have to see it. It has all the cool archaeological events and relics with Angelina Jolie and the action sequences. Hey, it's not going to be a classic but what the hey? This is still good fun and a satisfying movie."
2,Tomb Raider digging it's own grave?,"I saw this movie on home DVD and I am glad to say I didn't waste 7.50 to see it in the theaters. First off it's lack of real plot is very frustrating and seems just to be an excuse for action sequences for Angelina Jolie. Many who see and enjoy this movie will be men drooling over Ms.Jolie as Lara Croft. This is somewhat of a waste of cinema. The picture quality was great and supplemental features were slightly above average. But I'm afraid for the intelligent avid film lover and moviegoer, this will be predictably disappointing."
2,So-So | Another game movie down the drain.,"Let me think of how to say this. If Tomb Raider was never a game but this movie was made then the movie would have been awesome and bad games would have followed. When there is a good game then bad movies follow. This is the basic plot that is followed by gaming movies. The only movie ever coming close to breaking this disatrous trend was Final Fantasy, which also was sort of a bomb. This movie is basically a Indy Jones rip off, but with a girl with a stuffed bra. The story is awful, at least the indy movies were somewhat believable this is unbelievably far-fetched with big statues coming alive and a clock that makes the planets align. All controlled by the illuminati a secret society. Whoo im getting goosebumps now! Phew yea right. If you want to see a action flick that has a hot chick ( hey that rymes) then check it out but if you are a smart person than you will avoid."
2,lame!,"I was excited to see it and even bought it, my duaghter thought it was good and, well she is 4 so there you have it! I thought Angelina looked great but the character was very dull, not mysterious. We just kept waiting for it to have some content. Some okay action scenes but no Indiana Jones quality."
2,Angelina Jolie looks great but...,"Unfortunately, the movie does not. I didn't much care for Lara Croft. She seems to be somewhat of a rich spoiled girl who always gets her way no matter what. Like I said, Joile looks great, but her character so lifeless. You never get a sense a fear or aguish in Lara. Absolutely emotionless.Also there is really no originally in this movie. It borrows heavily from INDIANA JONES series as well as Ray Harryhausen's THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD. (Both feature a six-armed kali that comes to life).Joile is a great actress and I truly hope that she won't be making a whole series of Lara Croft movies in the future."
2,Where did they dig this movie up?,"I've been a big Tomb Raider fan for years. Sorry folks, but lets be honest. This movie was one of the worst action flicks ever. Special effects were fair to good. Sound was fair at best. The story line would have made a good game level, but it didn't make it in the movie. The acting was fair. The DVD has a few special features, interviews, and commentaries. If you're still curious rent it first. Save your dollars."
2,Ehhh... it's a rental,"In short, it's a watchable movie, but it only gets two stars because I wouldn't buy it.As far as the movie itself, ummm... what's going on again? Triangle pieces, time-control, boulder monsters, pet robots, etc... I felt like I was watching Wild Wild West again (oh, the horror!!!)I liked Jolie's barbie-exaggerated proportions, but not necessarily the Lara Croft character. What could be mistaken for strong will and independence in ""Lady"" Lara Croft, I found more to be attitude smug, physically inhuman, and emotionally unreachable; except for the one large crack in her padded armor - that ""mysterious"" death of her father (the Father will be with you... always) Funny thing about this movie is you rarely see the lighting directly on Jolie's face - instead focus is shifted to other areas as evidenced by the cover of the box). Prepubescent teenagers should get a thrill but I'll stick with Raiders of the Lost Ark."
1,Dang that was sad,This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I;m not sure why but the plot just never hooked me and it was waaayyyy to un-realistic. Take MI2 for exaple. It had to do with money whording pharmacies that make a virus and a cure to rake in the cash but Tomb Raider... it was mostly Angelina Jolie nude or half nude shooting some one to get a key to a time machine. WHOOOO!! a time machine. Sure.. Even the 9th gate was better than this movie. So if you like Angelina Jolie it was great!
1,Save your money.,"The first scene makes it clear that Lara is in no danger, and she remains in no danger throughout the movie.This is 90% of the plot, and the rest is even less worthy of discussion."
1,thought it was going to be cool...it blew chunks.,"chunks is my dog. this movie was soo awful. if you can believe it, it was barely worth seeing a glimpse of Jolie naked from the back! I like awesome special effects, choreographed action scenes, slo-mos, and cool babes. but this is really not worth it. before i saw, i thought that there was no way it could be horrible- not good maybe, but not horrible. It was."
2,Blu-ray??,"I've been loading up on big, dumb action movies on blu-ray, so when I saw this on sale for $10.99, I said why not... I popped the disc in, and was horrified at the picture quality- it looks like an upconverted dvd. If you have this on dvd already, then don't waste your money."
5,What a ride!,"I read so many bad reviews about this product, I was almost positive I would hate it. Then I came across the review Roger Ebert gave it for the Chicago Tribune. HE gave it 4 and half stars out of five. That peaked my interest. I found it at my Wal-Mart for $4. Figuring I could spare four bucks, I bought it, and watched it two days later. By far one of the best movies I've seen a LOOOONG time. Very intriguing plot, great acting, plus it's just plain fun. Combine Indiana Jones with Mission Impossible 2, and you have an idea what this is like. Plenty of special features to keep die-hard movie buffs happy. Plus it's got Angelina Jolie. Need I say more?"
5,Finally a book on EU trade policy!,"If you want to read a great book about the European Union and its trade policy, this is it. Actually, if you want to read any book about EU trade policy, this is it! Trading Voices explains how the Europeans plot and bargain to get their way in world trade. Unfortunately it does not talk about the current dispute between Europe and China over textiles, but the analysis could be extended to that case. I highly recommend this book."
3,Useful but outdated,"There is a usefulness for this book, but remember this book dates from the years 1994 and 2000. Here is one example of where things are outdated. The definition of 'beast' is said to be a derogatory term for a white person. Now as of this writing, circa 2011-12 'beast' is a term for something or someone who is extremely good at something. Note these may be some outdated parts of this book but there is still useful parts of this.Also this book is a dictionary, and I was expecting it more to be a study on Ebonics and information and less definitions. Oh well it is still good."
5,Interesting Book,"This book is well informed. Except for Anna May Wong, I didn't know any of these actresses. The sad thing is that the internet doesn't say much about these actresses either. So the author did well in giving praise to the unknown. The author says something to which I have to know. This is from the book, ""But the roles would necessarily be smaller and being nasty to Shirley would prove rather lethal-as Astrid Allwyn (Dimples, Stowaway)and others would later discover."" What did Temple do?"
3,International Inductive Study Bible,The bible was not in as good condition as stated. There was a lot of writting inside the Bible. Damage to the binding and a blue piece of paper glued in the Bible. The shipping time was wonderful I needed the Bible in a hurry and it came sooner than expected.
5,Goes Beyond all of the Home Runs.....,"In this book, you'll find out that Hank Aaron is not just a home run smasher. Statistics show that he is an excellent all-round player, probably better than most fans make him out to be.On top of being a star, Aaron's story is amazing with all of the racism, discrimination & hate that he went through.After reading this book, you will probably wonder why No. 715 was only SECOND on mastercard's most memorable moments. Also, you may, like me, want Hank to keep the home run record forever. I'd rather have someone who worked hard for it than a hideously overpaid A-Rod, or stuck-up Bonds.Bottom line: get this book if you enjoy sports at all."
4,Best Read If You Are A Fan,"I Had a Hammer is a wonderful book if you are a fan of Hank Aaron or of baseball in general. Aaron gives insights into what it was like to come out of Alabama during the Jim Crow era from his days as a boy, to playing in the Negro Leagues, signing with the Braves, all the way up until his retirement from baseball.That's the good part. As a life-long, Aaron fan I loved it. Unfortunately, the book lacks much of the passion and drive that led Aaron to breaking Ruth's unbreakable career home run record."
5,ANDRE WATTS PLAYS LISZT,"I bought this CD needing it to arrive by a certain date.The seller was definitely great about that and the CD , I knew before ordering is PHENOMENAL!I would buy from this seller any time. And if you do not have this CD in your library, consider buying it . EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCES."
5,Great Music,Brother Ali knows how to work with words. He delivers this album excellently. It is a pure form of what rap should be.
4,"I want to give it 4 and a half stars, but amazon limits me to 4","I have the version that comes with a bonus DVD and lyrics booklet. The packaging is really nice but lets talk about the music.After ""Shadows On The Sun"", one might deem it ""impossible"" for Ali to come back with anything as strong/critically acclaimed.... Well then prepare for the ""impossible"". As Ali spits about variety of issues [his divorce, his family, being broke and homeless, the war, his race, social issues, etc] and of course the battle raps Ali fans have grown to love,you will notice that there isn't one weak/mediocre song on the album. It also doesn't hurt that the beats are being supplied by Ant of Atmosphere.Considering the current saturation of mainstream hip hop with the usual(Money, Women, Cars, Rims, Guns, Diamonds...) and songs with nice beats, catchy hooks and of course a dance (sometimes a guilty pleasure of mine), ""The Undisputed Truth"" is definitely a breath of fresh air...GO COP THAT!!!"
3,"good, but not great","his beats still aren't amongst the elite hip hop productions, but vocals are nice as usual"
1,Kreeft v Science,"Kreeft's so-called socratic argument does not find it neccessary to include scientfic propositional content in his work on abortion, yet surely it is science that proves that anti-abortionists have no factual basis for their claims that the embryo or foetus is an autonomous organism. A shallow display of Aristotlean a priori reasoning, debatable essences not based on scientific fact, and an argument that doesn't work in real life. Hypatia, break Socrates out of there!!"
5,Keen,"I loved the book so much that I translated it in French and have used it with some of my students in Quebec. It has wit and insight, bundled with kindness.Peter Kreeft is a philosopher who talks to the brain instead of splashing about philobabble."
5,Fuel for the Soul fills you up,Michael Schroeder is a growing contemporary Christian artist who writes all of his own music and lyrics. His words cut to the heart. So many of his songs speak right to where you are. Fuel for the Soul is based on the need for you to go back to the Word for feeding. This CD is definitely worth your investment.
4,Fortunate Eagle's Life Story,"After viewing this on PBS, I decided I had to own it. I had lived in the town he is living in now for 10 years, and didn't even know it! I liked his life story and enjoyed seeing Nevada again, too. This is one very busy man."
3,"Somewhat flimzy, but does the job.","Overall, it's flimzy. The hose attachments are plastic and they do leak. I fear tightening them down further as they may break. It does keep our hoses (we bought 2) neat and orderly, that's a for sure. I wouldn't buy this one again though."
5,Great Hose Reel,"I've had one of these sitting outside in Florida for 10 years. It is finally starting to disintegrate from the sun but it has served me well all this time. Hopefully the latest version hasn't had too many ""Improvements"". This reel works just fine! Mine sits on the ground and I can tote it anywhere it is needed. You will have to guide the hose on by hand while you crank it in or it will jam up. Your foot on the front lower cross bar will keep it steady while you crank and the tote bar folds backwards out of the way. There is a rotating hose connection on the end opposite the crank that connects to the hose bib and I've had no trouble with it for 10 years. Just a plain, simple, hose reel that works and lasted 10 years. That's why I bought another one!I will edit this review when I get the new one (5-7 days).New one is just like the old one - great!"
3,Difficult to use,"Sturdy but the short lever and small diameter coil mean that it is difficult to roll anything but a short hose. Probably can handle 50' OK, but not 100'."
2,Garden hose holder,"This is not strong enough to hold a long house. I wanted it to sit on the ground and pull the hose out, but it isn't sturdy enought to do that. I crinked up the house where it attached as well."
1,connection leaks,"I bought two of these. The weak point in the design is the plastic tube that you attach the nozzle to. It's way too soft and flimsy, and strips very easily. I was able to make one connection work, with a lot of effort, but the second one leaks and I'm going to have to toss the new hose real and replace it with a more industrial strength one. It's too bad, because the overall design is quite good."
3,good but not rugged,I've had mine for6-7 years/ the weak link is the cheap plastic roll-up crank and as others have said the hose water connection is very difficult to connect so it doesn't leak.
3,2 and 1/2 stars really...,This is one of those strange movies where u can't figure out if u liked it or not.
3,"not the 3 kings, or national treasure","dudes, this like inbetween ""3 kings"" and ""national treasure."" i liked the movie, but, like, anything matthew mchonacy is in deserves a 3... member speed 2? that was a 2. his only 4 movie was that one romatinc comedy where he falls in love, and he's the ad executive -- that was a 4. but, the only thing cool about this flick was the sunken treasure, and the fact that a civil war ship was stranded in the dammed desert (dessert?). the whole thing a bout the evil guy trying to ruin the envivronment didn't work... that would not happen. saddam hussein or momor kadafi would have had that guy's ass in a sling. IT""S SOMALIA, SEND IN THE FREAKIN BLACK HAWKS!!! i'm out. j."
2,Ughhh... a movie that COULD have been..............,"It is always dissapointing to see what COULD have been a great film go down in flames....I have never read the Cussler novel so can only view the film on its own merit.The opening scenes in Richmond looked like this would be a great film........ then........UGHHHHHH it got real bad real fast.3 major problems....1) Penelope CruzShe is simply horrible and annoying in anything she does.2) Too much stupid humorWill Hollywood EVER make a straight adventure film again without it seeming like a big comedy romp ?It is so old seeing the straight guy and the goofy sidekick overdone once again.3) A soundtrack of classic songs which unfortunatley did not match the film at all !As a serious adventure this would have been a great 4-5 stars.... as it is, it was a bad waste of effort, ruined mostly do to it's overdone silliness and casting of the terrible Penelope Cruz."
2,Not Much Like The Book,"My dad lent me this book to read, so I thought I'd watch the video to see how it translated. The book is pretty farfetched (Abraham Lincoln ends up in the African desert?, they just happen to come upon a vanished flyer's plane?), but I liked it much more than the video. I can see why the author would be upset with the film. Too much Penelope Cruise (her character's hardly in the book and ends up in a wheelchair in the end - not in a bikini on the beach) and where the heck did she get a different outfit for every scene out of a small carry on bag? The villians aren't too villanous, the whole section about the old fort is missing, and there was no gold left on the ship (carted out by tribesmen after all the original shipmates died - a much more believeable premise). I guess it makes an OK straight to video release, but if you're looking for the book on film, this sure isn't it. I'll end up buying a copy to sent to my dad so I can hear him rant - that's always fun!"
2,maybe two and half,"Ok, it wasn't totally boring or anything, but gee, with that big of a budget and the big names involved 'ya think they could have made it a great action adventure thriller.It could have been Raiders of the Lost Ark, instead it was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.I've never read any of the books, I hear they are fun, I'm sure fans of Clusser are probably the most disappointed with this flick and I know I was disappointed with the film just based upon my expectation of what it was supposed to be.I'd definately recommend renting this one before buying it, I can't see watching a cheesy movie twice when the action is so mundane."
3,simple mindless fun,"It's summer, it's 110 degrees at 5pm outside, and the theatre is air conditioned. This movie is just fine. Beautiful scenes, places i'll never see in real life. It's simple, mindless fun for an evening. Unbelievable plot, nothing really makes sense so you stop trying and just drift with the flow.It's cute, busy, fun, with unsophisticated humor, and stupid jokes.just go for it."
3,Sahara is better then National Treasure.....a good time,"Matthew McConaughey (Dazed and Confused, Reign Of Fire, EDTV) and Steve Zahn (Suburbia, HappyTexas, JoyRide) play Dirk and Al, two treasure seeking guys who set out a journey to find a ancient civil war ship with a treasure of gold coins and Penelope Cruz (Woman On Top, Vanilla Sky, Blow) plays a doctor sent to Mali in which people are being poisoned. Some pretty good action sequences boosted by the 2 male leads' lively performances. William H. Macy (Cellular, Boogie Nights,Focus), Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, Timeline), Patrick Malahide and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty, The One, Broken Arrow) also star. Much funner and better then National Treasure, though in this one they should of trimmed the time down a bit...the time kept on dragging but still its a good action/adventure movie chock full but not the best. Based on the bestselling book by author Clive Clussler."
3,Predictable,"This film was okay ... glad we didn't spend the $50.00 or so to see it in a theater. Lots of ""adventure"", but predictable plot."
3,Just ok,"I wasn't too thrilled with this movie. Story got somewhat boring at times and since i read the book and liked it, I expected something a little bit more fun. Overall, ok for a rainy day when you have nothing else to do."
2,lame,"The sidekick whats-his-name is pretty funny, but the movie just sucks. If you have to even ask about the story, it's the same movie with a different name. I'm sure they're praying daily to the scientology God for a franchise, but I really hope it just dies.It's basically a chick-flick as well, because it's all about Matthew. He just adores himself.But hey, sometimes we want a stupid action movie to kill 90 minutes so it's got it's place.Wholly un-memorable."
1,God Awful Bulls***,"Sitting through this film is like having all my teeth pulled out. Why would they make a film of pure action with a very little storyline. The desert scenes wants to put you to sleep. So it was extremely boring including the action scenes. Plus it made no sense at all, very incoherent. Don't waste your money, trust me."
4,"If you love the books, you'll love the movie","If you are a fan of Clive Cussler, you will enjoy this movie. No Hiram Yager or St Julien Perlmutter though!"
3,Western countries ARE killing Nigerians in the name of capitalism,There is absolutely no chemistry between Matthew M. and Penelope C. Steve Zahn's character is borderline annoying. W.H. Macy and all the other characters are absolutely one-dimensional. BUT the plot line of the bad guys covering up how the mine activities is KILLING locals is happening RIGHT NOW in Nigeria. THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE DYING OR BEING PERMANENTLY BLINDED OR DISABLED! [...]People are dying and it's all just part of the G-20's continuing extraction of wealth from third world countries.
2,SAHARA REVIEW,I have read Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book. As you can see I am a big fan. If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought. I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment. The actors were very much less than convincing. The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie. Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln. The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie. If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing. In my final opinion movie very poorly done. Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.
2,It started with a bang and ended with a thud.,It started with a bang and ended with a thud. The majority of the scenery and the action scenes are jaw dropping. However the movie goes from bad to worse after 30 minutes. It's because of the plot and the directing I think.
4,"Good, but not great","This is your typical action adventure movie. There is an adventuous (naturally) doesn't follow any rules type of guy (McConaughey) and he usually has a sidekick (Zahn). There is also a tough advertuous woman as a love interest (Cruz). The plot is basically this McConaughey is looking for a lost Civil War ship in the African desert with his friend and they help out a beautiful woman doctor. This leads to trouble since she's trying to find out about a secret disease. They try to rescue her. I basically enjoyed the movie, although Matthew McConaughey kept reminding me of his character in Dazed and Confused. Penelope Cruz was whiny and stubborn and got on my nerves. Steve Zahn was funny as the wacky side kick, but he had some good action scences too. The soundtrack was great-classic American rock and roll!! There is also a supplemental soundtrack of the African music coming out soon. Fun movie!!"
3,Here we go again!,Boring for the first half and typical Hollywood for the second half. I believe that Hollywood has one script for their movies and they just change the names and locations on it to produce what seems to be different films that follow the same overall predictable outcomes. Overall: MEDIOCRE to DECENT!
3,Competent action/adventure,"Entertainment is a commodity. People buy it in bulk to fill their idle hours. This is a fair specimen of bulk entertainment.It has all the right pieces. There's the pair of happy go lucky ex-military buddies, out to make a few bucks, have a few laughs, and save the world. There's the pair of WHO doctors, out to track down a mysterious disease and to save the world. (The requisite babe is one of the doctors.) There's the evil business man, out to make a few bucks even if it destroys the entire Atlantic ocean.Did I mention credibility? No? There's a reason for that. If you can believe a gunboat from the American civil war in the middle of the Sahara, you'll get along with this movie just fine. You might even believe that the gun still works. If you don't look too closely, it's just a good guns'n'chases eco-fable where everyone keeps their clothes on. You could do worse. In fact, if you're considering this movie, you probably have done worse.//wiredweird"
4,Predictable but fun,"Matthew McConaughey, sporting a new moustache and dark hair, plays a treasure hunter who is seeking an iron-clad, Civil-war era ship which he thinks ended up in Africa. (Don't even ask how this could happen!) He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search. Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat. This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining. If you're not in search of great art, but are looking for an action and adventure-filled evening of entertainment, this just might fit the bill."
4,Why aren't there more movies like this?,"While Matthew M's pearly smile and Penelope C's exotic features may have been the draw for a large portion of the viewers, those ended up being bonus' beside the entertaining plot and delicious dialogue. This movie doesn't mess around with heavy drama or annoying romance. The romance was the part I was most worried about and I was happily suprised to find that they didn't hate each other, that the female didn't have to dominate the male, and that they didn't have to try to hide their emotions or make a lip-lock in every scene(in fact there's only one). Steve Z ws perfect - great lines and facial expressions. Sure, alot is improbable, but in this movie its not so tedious. I highly recomend this movie - and hey! Even if you hate it, at least you got to see Matthew's gorgeous smile!"
1,Look for gold elsewhere,"Pretty much the perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood movies today. Shifts effortlessly from one cliche to the next with no surprises, character development or sensible storytelling. Even the music is predicable. If you like explosions, this movie has them. If you are looking for anything else, look elsewhere."
2,Stupid!!!!!! Laughable!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!!!!!,"Can you believe that a Confederate ironside wreck, The Texas, was found in the middle of the Sahara desert???! Then the 'good guys' use one of the canons to shoot down a helicopter. Yeah...that could happen! The rest of the script also seemed to be made up as they went along.This was obviously a financial venture for Matthew McConaughey, since he co-produced it."
1,Generic,This movie is very generic. The plot is predictable and the characters are cliche and shallow.You will be bored.
2,Movie is not Book,"Book was better than the movie and I can understand what Cussler is boiling about. The final product is not what was agreed upon. The screenwriter did not read the book, he just threw scenes together and thought they would pan out. The book worked and the movie stunk!"
3,Sahara = not Indiana Jones,"Sahara was not better than Indiana Jones obviously.To be honest there's actually no comparing the two at all.I understand why people would think the two are alike but they aren't.Sahara offers more gun shootings , killings and car and boat chases.But all that doesn't even matter ,when you have Harrison Ford playing Indiana and George Lucas is the writer.Sahara was a decent ride ,but people should put there foot in their mouths when they speak of Indiana Jones.Steve Zaun finally plays a tough guy character.He's a weapons specialist and he adds a hint of comedy."
4,Not a bad flick,"OK the reviewers of movies have done it again.... blasted a movie for being just what its supposed to be, a action movie and nothing more. this is not about anything else and as such does pretty well. I saw this today and both myself and my 2 boys came out enjoying the movie.Now I think at times I would of liked a different dirk pitt, and maybe a little better chemistery between pitt and dr. rijas, but all in all a good action movie. Worth going to see."
2,"Okay, if you're bored and want to watch something...","This is an okay film. Nothing great, and you won't remember it after you've watched it, but it's okay."
3,Not like the book,"I enjoyed the book, and bought the DVD as a gift for my son, thinking it would be much the same, with gadgety boats, cool cars, Indiana Jones type action, and a bit of horror movie thrown in. The movie didn't deliver - it sort of picked and chose what parts of the book to use. If I hadn't had such high expectations, the movie would have been more enjoyable, as it did have believable characters and a good plot and moved along for the most part (sometimes it lingered over scenery a bit much). So if you want a good action movie and haven't read the book, this should fit the bill. But if you read the book and want to see the movie bring it to life, don't get your hopes up."
3,A fun diversion,"I had some fun and a few laughs watching this even though it wasn't a great movie.The action scenes were good and the plot had a few original twists like the boat sub-plot.I thought the sidekick stole the movie .Funny guy.One thing about the film industry though.I have to believe that half the population that is in the military is a navy seal .At least they didn't haul out the old ""best there ever was"" cliche."
1,Pretty Bad,This is one of the most far fetched & unrealistic movies i've ever seen. It seemed more like a Disney kids adventure movie. The talent of Matt McConaughey & Penelope Cruz is completely wasted. Steve Zahn ruins the movie with his typical idiotic performance & stupid one line attempts at humor. A good one to miss.
2,Ridiculous,I was excited about buying this movie. The trailer was sure deceptive as I thought it would have been interesting and fun. I thought it bordered on ridiculous. Matthew's character was not blieveable at all. It was also pretty hard to imagaine Penelope as a doctor. The only actor who played his part and actually had me believeing in his character was Zahn. Sahara could have done a lot better if the script as welll as the acting was better
2,big letdown,"I read the book and loved it so I rented the movie hoping it would come pretty close. Didn't happen.If you haven't read the book you might enjoy the action but with out reading it the movie is kind of hard to follow. The part of Dirk Pitt is also portraded badly beacuse he's suppose to be the dashing strong fearless hero but Al stands out more than Dirk.The movie also skips some of the best parts of the book and totaly changes the story line. In short, read the book, its better use of your time."
4,Ridiculous plot but a lot of fun,"I've never read Clive Cussler so I can't compare the movie to his novel, but I enjoyed the film. It's not a classic and it won't win any awards but it will entertain you. Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordano are treasure hunters looking for an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that may have somehow ended up in Africa. Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the WHO investigating a new illness spreading from an African country. They cross paths and together find the source of the disease and eventually find the Civil War ship. The plot is preposterous and you never believe Cruz as a WHO physician but the movie is action packed from beginning to end and Steven Zahn as sidekick Al provides some genuinely funny moments. Sahara delivers exactly what it sets out to, a few hours of mindless entertainment."
4,Still a fun movie for the adventure-lover in you,"OK, Matthew was nicely buff. Steve Zahn still has great comic timing. Even Penelope Cruz wasn't too irritating. This Indiana Jones wannabe didn't have quite the intrigue, but is still a fun movie for the adventure-lover in you. Matthew was hopeful this character would become a movie franchise. I think that if they kick the script writing up a notch or two, and they change out the femme fatale, they should try for a sequel."
2,I Expected More...,"After hearing Clive Cussler's name mentioned in reverential terms for so long, my expectations for this movie adaptation of his book were rather high.So, I was rather disappointed to see that the characters were all cardboard cut-outs and while the action of the film is quite consistent, the plot somehow meanders along without much cohesiveness.So, while I did make it through to the end, overall, I was bored by this rather expensive looking film."
5,Good adapation from best selling book.,"I thought this was an excellent movie. Lots of action, adventure, and humor.The movie is based on a best selling book by Clive Cussler. While parts of the book were dropped due to time constraints, I thought it still followed the book as well as can be expected. Lead actor Matthew McConaughey did a great impression of Dirk Pitt. Hopefully they will make many more."
1,Craptacular!,"This movie was one of the worst movies of the last 5 years. It stands with 'alone in the dark' as pure hollywood garbage. It is a lame rehash of Indiana Jones, The Mummy, and any other 80's adventure/treasure movie ever made. I laughed so hard at how lame it was, and then realized that it will one day be on a mystery science theater episode. Yuck!"
2,"""Not What I Expected""","This movie was originally a book written by Clive Cussler. I expected a lot more thrill in a movie compared to both James Bond and Indiana Jones. Boths of those movie series were spectacular but this wan't. This movie also was very lengthy at two hours and 3 minutes. With Mathew McCounough, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz I expected more but in my ming it was a big bust. Just rent this one and throw it out the window when you are done."
3,Great Adventure,This is a great adventure laced with American history which is true. Any adventure lover will enjoy this flick and others like it. A bit short of Indiana Jones series with Harrison Ford and The Mummy series with Brandon Frazier. Has a great story line
2,Don't go into this expecting it to be the book,"Sahara as written by Clive Cussler is a great book. This movie just had the title, the jist of the plot for his book and the names of the characters he uses. The action is non stop which does make it an ""edge of the seat"" film, and the interaction between Al and Dirk is good, but the acting is terrible otherwise."
3,A Good Popcorn and Coke Movie,"Sahara is, in essence, the same movie that we see bearing half a dozen titles every summer. It's not thought provoking, scary, or romantic. But it does have action, and it's mildly funny. Steve Zhan is a hillarious guy, he ought to get bigger parts. But anyway, it's fun to watch, and not boring by any stretch. It reminded me of Indiana Jones without the intrigueing storyline."
2,"Boring, National Treasure = better!","I got this movie because I was wanting a good action movie. I thought it would be like an advanced version of National Treasure (which I loved).The truth is folks, it is dull, degrated, and just boring.The main plot is that 2 guys are looking for a treasure lost in the civil war.At many times the movie gets slow and you already know what will happen next.Another thing is: I'm sure all third world country rersidents speak fluent English.If you want a better movie that you won't be dissapointed about, rent XXX: State Of The Union or National Treasure.Last Word:Not as good as it looks."
4,Good Enough,"Sahara is great fun, with lots of historical aspects added in to the present day adventure. I found a few problems compared to Cussler's book, but that is okay. Overall the character of Dirk Pitt being played by Matthew McConaughey to be pretty spot on. Zahn as Al Giordino was not cast well, however, as he looks nothing like Cussler's character from the several books Al has been in. Besides that, the story is great and the ""thrill of the chase"" is always done right. The scenes in the desert were fun and remind you of Indiana Jones movies perhaps. I have learned that many more of Cussler's adventures will be made into films so I look forward to seeing Dirk Pitt in lights soon!"
2,Missed out on what gave the book three stars.,"Finding lost relics & gold, saving the world from destruction, mysterious history, remote settings, non-stop action. This movie had the fun glitz of the novel, but lacked in much of what made the book a more intelligent read. Not that Cussler's books are provocative for my mental neurons, I read them when I am in the mood for surrealistic action typical to James Bond. However, this movie went over the top, to the point of being preposterous."
4,Fun and action packed,"I enjoyed this movie, even though it was a VERY loose adaptation of Clive Cussler's book (by the way, Sahara is one of my favorites of Cussler's books, although most of his books are great!) However, that said, the movie was fun with lots of action, and humor. It's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then, what is? Definitely worth watching, and if you're into this type of movie, worth owning!"
2,A funny entertainment for kids!,"This is a typical movie of easy evasion; it deals with a ingenious script that pitifully was wasted, due its actual relevance. The well known of stunts and special effects weighed much more than any other circumstance.What it could have been a full and rounded off movie with major dimensions, a serious ecologic warning, simply vanished packaged by a sand torment.But, if you overlook that premise and let your neurones rest, you will obtain a gratifying pop corn movie than will be forgotten very soon."
2,What is going on here...,"The action was good in this movie, but everything else was crap.The plot isn't anything special. They go to Africa for some coins and they end up having to stop a virus from destroying everything. It's really not that original.The characters are weak. Steve Zahn does a good job, but his antics have grown old. Matthew Mccounaghey(does anyone know how to spell this?) is cool. Penelope Cruz deserves an academy award. Just kidding, she sucked.As for anything I didn't mention, assume it was awful."
3,"Good movie, nothing compared to the book","I had high hopes for this movie, it looked good in the previews and everything, and the book is one of my favorites, so I was hoping it would be pretty good. And it was. However, I was still disappointed by it, because I think it could've been better. Some of the best parts of the book are cut out for the movie.Anyway, if you've never read the book, go ahead and buy it. If you have read it, then you should rent this."
2,If only.....,"Had the movie been as exciting and tension filled as the attack on and the disappearance of the CSA's ironclad Texas this film would have been great. Matthew M, a graduate of the Keanu Reeves school of acting, really is quite poor."
2,Sahara's background music distracting & inappropriate,The excessive use of irrelevant 1970s music adds nothing to this interesting adventure story. At times it is nearly impossible to understand the dialogue due to the volume of the music. Most of the music (songs) chosen have absolutely nothing to do with the story and they mainly serve to ruin the experience. The book was many times more interesting.
2,"Weak plot, weak ending","Warning, this contains somewhat of a spoilerYou have 2 big stars and one up and comer, and enough money to do just about anything with the movie within reason.So why then, end the friggen movie with a lame fight scene and a predictable defusing of a bomb?A typical script is 110 pages long. I would imagine the script for Sahara went something like thispages 1-80 build up of something good to come80-110 insert cheesy fight scene and defusing of a bomb here.If it was a Jackie chan movie, ok, end the movie with a big fight scene, but last I checked Matthew Mcconaughey is not known for his martial arts (and with good reason).WRITE AN ACTUAL ENDING"
1,did they read any of the books before picking the cast??,"I've only made it through about 20 minutes so far, but my disappointment in the casting of Al Giordino will sour the rest of the movie. The actor they cast as 'Al' couldn't be much further from the character in the novels. He's a swarthy, swashbuckler who has an eye and a way with the ladies. Steve Zahn does not fit the profile at all..........."
4,Old-Fashioned African Adventure,"The infusion of wailing guitars of 70s rock monsters and the flashy action sequences are all that really separate this movie from the old black-and-white movies I would watch on rainy Sunday afternoons. Matthew McConaughey is buff, Steve Zahn is funny, Penelope Cruz is more than a pretty face, jam-packed with action scenes - all in all this movie was much more enjoyable than I thought it would be."
4,Not too shabby,"Not a bad movie at all there is some really good action in this one. Also a pretty neat idea of the ironclad. It was a shade bit dull in the middle for about 15 min when they walk around the desert. But all in all I gave it 4 starts, maybe 4.25 on a good night. I would suggest it."
3,"Ridiculous storyline, but still fun to watch",The storyline is completely ridiculous for most of the movie. But it's still a lot of fun to watch. Just a regular fun adventure film. Awesome soundtrack though!
3,Not great at all.,"Just a wild film of tons of things that simply can't happen, or anywhere close to it, but for kids it's just a fun diversion from reality. Not great acting, and especially by Cruz who adds very little to the film and I had hoped she would. Wonderful filming and sets as well."
4,sahara,"This one has lots of action. The plot is predictible with the underdog being beaten down by the dictator. The three, with help from some humor keep the whole thing moving. Worth watching."
4,Clean fun,"It is sort of movie that you watch once and have fun during. Good action scenes, stretched out fantasies."
3,"""You do throw like a girl""","Based on a Clive Cussler novels. Civil war Virginia the ironclad ""The Texas disappears. Present day Africa there is a plague outbreak. Dr. Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz) while investigating the plague is perused by people with ulterior motives. She has to be saved and assisted by treasure hunters including Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey in green contacts and dark hair) looking for the misplaced ""Texan.""Othern than standard Indiana Jones formula the most annoying part is the loud background music that overwhelms the scenes. However they were clever with the use of ""Magic Carpet Ride"" at the appropriate time. Everyone except Penélope was hairy faced.Passes time well. However nothing exceptional.Contact ~ Matthew McConaughey"
5,great adventure movie,This was a very good movie! Lots of action and adventure! Good actor choices for this too!! good choice for a family movie night
2,"Great Books, Bad Movies","I was disappointed when I finished watching Sahara. When I heard the book was being made into a movie, I was excited. Who wouldn't, Dirk Pitt on the silver screen a second time in a better vehicle. I am a Cliver Cussler fan and I was severely disappointed. Dirk obsessed with a Civil War Ironclad? Rudy portrayed as a bumbling stooge? No Abraham Lincoln or mention of Kitty Mannock, who's plane Dirk and Al make into a sail racer? It's like Raise the Titanic, half the book, missing the other half. And to the producers, Dirk was a Major in the US Air Force before Sandecker recruited him for NUMA, not the US Navy, get it right. Now I really don't blame Cussler if he decides not to have any more of his books turned into movies."
4,In search of a lost ironclad,"The plot of this movie is pretty far-fetched: a guy and his friend are in search of a Confederate ironclad which supposedly left Richmond carrying a fortune in gold coins. A clue found by chance seems to point to west Africa, then northwards into the Sahara desert. But there is more than a shipload of gold involved... an environmental disaster threatens the entire Earth, seemingly from the same area.This movie has it all: spies, corporate bad guys, tinpot dictators, high-tech gizmos, romance and even a medical mystery. In fact, it may have just a little TOO much. At times it's hard to catch your breath during this film!"
3,Desert Storm of Action and a Little Comedy!,"This movie wasn't that bad even with 3 stars. I like Matthew (especially in TIME TO KILL) and Penelope is ok, attractive but her acting wasn't the best (kinda like her in Gothika even though it was a short role), but then again overall it was a comedy action movie. William H Macy, i like his funny parts in other movies as well. I bought this on HD and can't wait to watch it!! The bad guy wasn't convincing, and the storyline was not bad, but as for an overall movie, I would recommend it if say they like Indiana Jones, or some thrill ride. . . . It's a good movie, and I'm glad to purchase it for my HD DVD COLLECTIONS! Atleast RENT THIS for a relaxing night!"
2,Fairly Entertaining but Silly...the Book is Better!,"Hollywood moguls should be required to actually READ the books they turn into movies. This is not a bad interpretation of ""Sahara"" but it could be so much BETTER. Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler's sophisticated, clear-thinking hero..sweaty, grubby and smelly looking with a Texas twang?? Pahleeze!! Loyal, sturdy, reliable Al Giordino reduced to being a goofy sidekick?? No, No, No! And Rudi Gunn, a brilliant scientist and 2nd in command at NUMA as - what? - a college sophomore on spring break?? Just when fans think it couldn't get worse..Admiral James Sandecker, a man of power and authority, turned into a somewhat befuddled mid-management type!! EGADS!! The travesty of it all!! I implore people with intelligence and imagination to read the book. It's WAY better."
5,Kickin' Music and Mayhem,"So what that the plot reaches? So what that the coincidensesare ""out there""? This film ROCKS!!! Grab the popcorn, sit back andjust enjoy the ride. McConaughey and Zahn are the new skool Crosbyand Hope, the chemistry and comraderie are through the roof! ThoughI have to admit that Zahn definitely steals the show throughout. Add all this with a great soundtrack and you've got a ""reel"" goodtime!Two thumbs up!!!!"
4,Highly enjoyable film,"This movie is actually quite a bit different from the book in several days. Usually, when this happens in a book-to-movie translation, the result is disappointing. However, 'Sahara' was a novel packed with a LOT of scenes, action, and the like, and it would have been impossible to get all of it into the movie.The producer and writers did a decent job of bringing and adapting the book to the screen. You don't have to read the book to like the movie. but I still recommend it because the book is very, very good. It would have been nice if they put in the whole story/plot with the mines (and Malenka), but oh well. The movie has quite a few awesome action scenes that are enjoyable to watch, so two thumbs up from me. And the actors did a nice job with their roles."
1,If you need a good nap go see this movie,I thought it looked like a bunch of men running around in circles trying to look like they were acting and trying to make a movie. But then don't rely on me cuz I fell asleep during the first third of it.
2,Barely entertaining...,"...as the story (however stupid) drags on (into nowhere). Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says ""The hunt for the gold begins here"" and ""The search for the mysterious ship"" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment. Sahara is a failure, lacks charm and story, and will soon be forgotten."
1,Bad choice for lead actor.,Treasure hunters stranded in the desert??.. every scene is ruined by McConaughey's horribly OVER BLEACHED teeth!Why can't these casting and makeup departments TRY for a little more realism?
2,"Good action movie, dissappointing treasure hunt movie","I expected this movie to be about treasure hunting. Heck, the dvd even says a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond. Yeah, right! This wasn't anywhere near Indiana Jones. It seemed to me that the treasure-hunting was just a backdrop for the rest of the events in the movie.The cast was great but the characters were too weak. They had some cheezy lines. I thought the script was pretty bad. In the end, it seemed to me that the bad guy had a good idea to start with, that just went wrong. Given time, he would have fixed it.I had high hopes for this movie and was sorely disappointed. It's a good action movie that you can watch to pass the time."
3,Farfetched throughout but is entertaining at times,"I would not say this is a good movie or a bad movie it's in the middle so it's an ok film. The movie is an adventure film so it's farfetched throughout the movie. Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey is looking for a Confederate ironclad ship that impossibly might have ended up in the desert. Soon he and his faithful sidekick Al Giordino (Steve Zahn) are lost in another adventure, discovering a deadly contaminate being tracked by a beautiful doctor (Penelope Cruz). The story about the confederate ship is good and entertainign it's the story about the poison in the water that is boring. If they would of sticked with finding the ship it would of been a really good movie. The movie is so predictable and funny at times for example they find Penelope Cruz in a well out of the whole desert as if but it's a movie. The movie is entertaining and it's pretty good at times for me to recomand."
3,Good Kid Adventure,Similar to National Treasure. No blood or cussing just a good old plain adventure story. Nothing new here. Same old Hollywood formula. I would suggest NT over this. Great to watch with the kids and if the kids are not home then watch Indiana Jones again.
2,"Mildly entertaining, but ultimately lacking","The upside is that the movie has an interesting plot and non-stereotypical events & action scenes. It keeps you interested as the plot about the coins, ironclad and plague unfolds and you begin to put it together. However, the movie lacked character chemistry - it's supposed to be a ""buddy"" movie with the main characters friends since kindergarten. But the way they interact is more like annoyed co-workers. Of course there's also the romance angle, but that lacked chemistry too. Normally you look for the hero & girl to shack up by the end because you feel they're made for each other (or at least would be a nice couple), but in this movie I just didn't care. The ending was pretty unsatisfying as well - one expects that everything eventually gets artfully tied together to make sense to the viewer, but instead it is hastily slapped together. In the end, it's not a horrible movie and does have some redeeming qualities, but is lacking in several ways."
5,Absolutely hillarious,"I first found out about this book when he was appeared in a benefit show for my schools fine arts program, since he graduated from it. He gave excerpts from the book and I bought it at intermission. The book is hillarious and offers a unique view into what would happen if famous architects designed outhouses. Each picture is accompanied by a historical and analytical text. This book is a great collection to add to your bathroom reading material."
5,PURE GENIUS!,"This author and cartoonist is the greatest hidden treasure in the publishing industry. I'm not sure if this guy has made a fortune yet, but if not, somebody better grab him up quick...He's the next Gary Larson, Matt Groenig, Mike Judge! Some of the funniest writing combined with unique hand drawings I've ever seen~ Buy several copies and give to friends. I did."
4,"Great, But Guitar Mix a Little Meek!","I am a big fan of Dio Sabbath, so I am very familiar with the few releases they did. Dio still has the magic in this performance! (RIP) The song selection is good and Appice on the drums is still solid. My only complaint is that the guitar mix needs a little more volume in the lossy format. I can't really comment on the mix in the HD audio encoding since I can't decode HD audio yet."
4,Very Good,"I think the performance of Ronnie James Dio is outstandingI really enjoy this blue ray, and I hardly recommended"
5,Radio City is not enough..,Radio City Music Hall is small for the size of these giants of Metal. Incredible performance of Black Sabbath with Dio in excellent shape. An excellent record of the last passages of this little giant! Long live R&R and RIP RJD!
5,"Amazing, detailed book","An amazing collection of detailed information, invaluable to anyone who's interested not just in pretty writing, but in all the detail and background information as well. Always wanted to know how to prepare your very own feather to write with? Want to know how to make a prepared animal skin into an amazing handcrafted book? How about the differences between the wide variety of kinds of paper? This book covers it. The only quibble I have is that the discussion on the preparation and use of historic pigments fails to mention how very toxic many of them are."
1,Much better out there..,"I've read about 20 books now as I am training to be a trainer. This book is difficult at best. It's definitely scientific in it's language which at times is hard to follow but the author also creates many abbreviations for terms that make reading it without having to look back virtually impossible. The second thing I find extremely inappropriate is the author's advocacy of leash jerks, shock collars and ear pinches. There is plenty of new research out there that offers ways to train your dog without doing irreparable damage to your relationship or exercising animal abuse as a sound way to exhibit control. Patricia McConnell, Stanley Coren and Turid Rugaas offer but better advice and write in a way that us mere mortals can understand."
3,a bit too technical,"I was required to purchase/read this book for a seminar I was attending. While a lot of the information was very useful, I found the use of acronyms very confusing as they didn't seem to fit the terms. I found myself constantly referring back several pages to find out what she was referring to. Some of the examples resembled mathematical equations or seemed to-very confusing!.....quite a few of the other students at the seminar felt the same way - there are better books to read."
1,Not plain english,This book bogs one down in the words and explanations. After three chapters I wish she would get to the point.
1,"I did not find the ""plain English"" in this book","I was very disappointed with this book. It is certainly not in plain English, focused way too much on theories and makes it not very approachable. I was hoping to find practical solutions, not some professor talk. To some extent I can only blame myself: only a PhD can write something like that and then put ""plain English"" in the title. Next time I will make sure I check the author's background first..."
1,Explaining in Plain English how dogs learn and how best to teach them,This has to be about the worse book I have ever attempted to read related to dog behavior. It is a difficult read in that it is mostly theoretical statements with absolutely no practical suggestions as how to approach and solve dog issues. I threw it in the trash about 5 minutes after I began browsing through it.
3,Interesting but not life changing,Interesting take on animal behavior and training...some good points but not life changing. Good edition to others in your training library.
1,Excel,"It is a good book. If you can understand it. I consider myself a pretty smart person, but with this book I'm having to reread every page two or three times. I'm also involved with a book club and we are going through it really slowly and talking about it because all six of us are having problems. So its really hard to understand."
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a disappointment! This book reads as though it was written by two different authors. The first hundred pages are an interesting story of a young man and his adventures and then...this book totally falls apart...vampire...GIVE ME A BREAK... then, you reach the last chapter which is where the story becomes totally ridiculous. The parts do not fit together. If I were teaching cretive writing I would tell the author, ""You can't do this."" The story just doesn't hold together.SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,Dark Shadows Rip-off,"Is it just me or have we heard this story before. This is the biggest rip-off of Dark Shadows I have ever seen. I could have written this book. If I was this author, I would be ashamed to publish this."
2,Sorry to say it...,"S.E. Hinton is my favorite Author, so when i found out about Hawkes Harbor, i went to buy it. sadly to say that unlike her beautifully written other books, like The outsiders or Rumble Fish, Hawkes Harbor does not deliver.Its about a 28 year old man, Jamie, who is in a mental hospital becasue of somthing that happened. you find out the man he works for is a vampire, which i find very differnt for S.E. Hinton. is goes back and forth from Terrence View to Grenville's home.Its just not like her other stories..."
1,She should have stuck to young adult books,"This was simply bizarre. At first, you think you're reading a typical S.E. Hinton novel...troubled young man, rough childhood, etc.. Then suddenly, you're reading a ridiculous VAMPIRE story! Yes, you heard me - VAMPIRE. The craziest thing about this book is that the vampire actually gets ""cured"" - of course, the author never lets the reader in on how this amazing little feat occurs - but, suddenly the man that has been tortured by the vampire is now all buddy-buddy with him. Again, a very bizarre book."
2,Surprised but not in a good way,"I was so swept into the story, and the first hundred pages were fantastic. The character of Jaime Sommers is wonderful but as soon as I realized the Vampire thing was inteded to be ""real"" and not in Jaime's mind, I lost faith. I guess I was hoping for a ""serious"" adult book but this rapidly turned into a farce. The writing was excellent throughout, but in the end I wound up thinking it was still a book for a younger, less sophisticated reader. Could not recommend except as a novelty."
3,"Good ""breather"" book, but don't take it too seriously.","I don't regret reading Hawkes Harbor, but this may be because I didn't buy it myself.I liked the main character a lot, I liked the friendships and relationships he had with other characters. I liked how the story was told; the nonliniar fashion allowed for 20+ years of life to be clearly understood in the low number of pages.But, my goodness, does Ms. Hinton need an editor. If I was an english teacher, and this story was turned in to me, she'd get a C in grammar, and a B- in language use. Oh, and some points off for the unanswered questions (some raised in the last few pages).As a rainy-day read when you want a break from your normal diet of anything easily genre-classified, Hawkes Harbor is definitely a decent choice."
1,Possibly the worst vampire novel ever,"I don't claim to have read every vampire novel ever written, but I'd definitely like to nominate this one for the award. What starts out as an entertaining tale of bad boy Jamie Sommers quickly degenerates into an abyss of disjointed attempts at a plot. And, one would think that, with the unusual twist of the vampire being cured, e.g. no longer a vampire, that this 'cure' would be a part of the story. But no, that's not the case.Don't waste your time on this one!"
4,Not dissapointed,This book is very well written like all of S.E. Hintons books are. It did take me a little time to accept the theme of the book because I was so used to how realistic her previous books were. S.E. Hinton is an amazing author and I would definently recommend this book
2,Not Nearly As Good As Her Other Books,"When you think of S.E. Hinton, the Outsiders comes to mind. That was a wonderfully written book, with strong characters who you grew to love by the end of the story. I did not feel this with Hawkes Harbor. I didn't really like the characters and by the end of the book, I was thoroughly bored. I didn't want vampires out of an S.E. Hinton book. Though I knew I had to read it because she had written it, I was a little worried that I wouldn't like it and I was right. So, if you're looking for a S.E. Hinton book to read, pick up either The Outsiders or That Was Then, This is Now."
2,I wish I had bought this book,"The book reviews are so bad, that I will not buy it. I would be a liar if I now said that there is an unanimous reason to pick up one copy and read it from cover to cover. Maybe it would be better to use a tissue for a bookmark in the book I imagined that ""Hawkes' Harbor,"" would be and leave that copy for the next guy. For S.E. Hinton, it seems that she has failed to write the novel well. Maybe it's because vampire's can not feel human passion that he does not pursuit them for more than blood. The flashbacks would only make sense to vampires needing to understand something that was important to human minds. No where does it say that S.E. Hinton wanted to take us into the mind of a vampire, nor do I profess to be one. Thanks. Keep a light on."
3,an entertaining departure,"I have been an avid reader since childhood, but I never did read anything by Hinton, I stuck with the 'girl stuff'..Norma Klein, Judy Blume, ""Nancy Drew"". I rarely enter the horror genre, except as a change of pace...I have read a few Stephen Kings, one Dean Koontz (never again!)and an Anne Rice. I did enjoy gothic novels (Daphne du Maurier) during my teens.Hawke's Harbor was a change of pace. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It held my interest far better than most of what I've read lately. It was unique, and yes WEIRD as another reviewer put it. But so what? Sometimes weird is good, it shakes you out of a reading rut."
3,Utter Bizarreness (if that's a word),"Wow. I got this book at the airport while waiting for my husband's flight (which was being delayed again and again) to arrive. I have to say right now, it's got to be one of the weirdest books I've ever read.It's compelling; the whole introduction to the madness of the principle character, and it unwinds the mystery quite efficiently... however it is just beyond odd. A vampire, who hopes to mend his naughty-vampy ways, first tortures, then nurtures his little sidekick, Renfieldy kind of character.I have to say it was original, I cannot deny that. But it's still weird.3 stars"
3,Barnabas Collins Meets S. E. Hinton,"S. E. Hinton like me must have been very taken by the T. V. series Dark Shadows. Three of the four major characters featured in Hawkes Harbor are straight out of the series. Only their names are changed. I wouldn't be surprised if the fourth major character had been buried away in episodes that either I didn't see or fail to remember. Hinton's take on the characters gives them more depth than they revealed on Dark Shadows, but Hinton's writing is fairly pedestrian. The book is a quick and good read."
1,Hawkes Harbor,"A terrible book, what happened? Something about an orphan boy meeting vampires and zombies. What's that supposed to mean? The second half of the book is terrible. A third person omniscient view. Hinton needs to be a better writer to make it entertaining. Overall, this book was an absolute CHOKE!!! I regret having wasted five days of my life reading this book."
1,Hawkes Harbor,"This book was truly awful. Not only was it boring, but it read like it was written by committee. There was no depth of character and the story was disjointed at best. Grenville goes from being a hideous vampire to kindly Mr. Hawkes. Also there were several typographical errors not caught by the editor. Very sloppy. I've never read Hinton's work before, and this book left me very unimpressed. What a waste of my time."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I hadn't read S.E. Hinton since ""The Outsiders"" and ""Tex"" so I was really looking forward to this new release. It is an interesting story, told in a somewhat confusing way. But it is relatively short (250 pages) and once you buy into the plot, it is easy to have some fun with the story and it becomes entertaining. But if you are looking for a real human interest story that says something about our society (a la her more famous titles), don't waste your time with this. There are plenty of better books out there."
1,Greatly disappointing,"Hinton has clearly not improved at all since her adolescent works. I get the impression that she has tried to apply the same amount of talent that she had as a sixteen year to her works of ""adult fiction"", and unfortunately they still read as fanstical teen-fic. A story linking an insane asylum, pirates, and vampires would be difficult enough for a truly gifted and dedicated author. Unfortunately, whether she lacked the talent or the effort, this one is a bomb."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"I am a book worm. I read a lot. I insulted my own intelligence reading this terrible book. Hinton couldn't make up her mind about what kind of story to tell, so she combined a number of genres and create literary crap."
1,Bad,"This book is bad-too bad to detail all the ways it is bad. I picked it up, I imagine, for the same reason most other did, because S.E. Hinton rocked our teenage worlds with her early novels. I wish I had left it alone. Like Barry from High Fidelity wonders, ""Is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins . . . ?"" In this case, the answer is a loud yes."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to a new book from S.E. Hinton, until I read part of the book. I could not believe all the profanity and explict sexual content in Hawkes Harbor. The story line was additonaly weak and unrealistic. I wish I had never purchased the book. I love her other books and used them in a classroom setting for reading remediation and the students never had to be be reminded to read. Hawkes Harbor has tainted my feelings for the author and her works. I will think twice before recommending her books for fear the student would do as I and think Hawkes Harbor was of the same caliber as her earlier works."
2,Do not waste your time on this book.,"I read this book as part of a reading group of which I am a member. Base on the preson who picked this book, I was looking forward to an enjoyable read. However, this was a very very disappointing book. Simply put the story line is silly and a waste of time. It appears to be the author's goal to have the story broken into three parts but there is no flow and very little connection between the parts of the story. For example, the last 30 pages do not connect with the rest of the story at all and looks like an ending that one sees when the author does not know how to end a book. Also, there graps in the story line. Such as, what does the Vampire do to address the curse? It seems to get better but how? The bottomline is that if you want a story on a Vampire, go rent a video of Dark Shadows."
5,love them,"These are great leather shoes. THey are one of the few shoes that are wide enough to fit both my foot and my orthotics! Since they are leather they have some stretch, and clean very well. They look good with both dress pants and jeans. Highly recommend in ALL colors!"
5,Great science book with fun experiemnts,One of my favorite books as a kid! I never had the attention span to read it all the way through but now that I ordered it again I am enjoying it over and over. An amazingly written book will help your kids get a love of science and its many facets. Parent's assistance in enjoying the book is recommended otherwise they might miss alot like I did!
5,Great for pre-teens.,"For the kids who are inquisitive and love science, this book is the perfect choice. I've not found another book like it."
1,Explorabook: A KId's Science Museum in a Book (Klutz),"What I thought was purchased as a new book ended up ""very used"". I am disappointed in purchase since this was a birthday gift for my granddaughter."
5,Hawaii Customer After,"After some initial postal problems, (I live in Hawaii) the company bent over backwards to see that my shopping experience was a pleasant one! I will do more business with these people. All items I ordered are working so far. ( Ive only had them for day) Mark Stone, Hawaii"
3,Ok for low light needs,"These single LED Night lights do not put out as much light as a 4 watt incandescent bulb. If you just need to light a path to the bathroom it's fine, but if you actually want to be able to see what you're doing, get a multi-LED model."
2,Auto on/off sensor doesn't work,"I bought two of these MLN-09 Night lights and neither one turns off during the daytime or when lights in the room are turned on. I've tried them all over the house and none of the lights in any of the rooms are bright enough to trigger the night light to turn off. The only way I found to trigger them to turn off is to shine a flash light directly into the sensor. So, if you don't mind that they run all day then they are OK. I was considering returning these two night lights, but I figure the return shipping cost would negate the value I get back from a refund.Note: I also bought two MLN-11 2-LED bright night lights which are also from Maxxima. Those lights actually turn off during the day as I would expect. So, those I would recommened the MLN-11 instead."
4,Closing the Ring,"I don't know why this great movie wasn't shown here in the USA. It was made by one of the great movie makers, Sir Attenborough, stars Shirley McLain and Christopher Plummer and is a story about USA pilots in WWII. So far, you can't even rent the DVD here in the US. I saw the movie in Australia last year, 2007."
2,"Not Very Good At All, Despite The Impressive Pedigree","I'd never heard of this film, but given the impressive cast and crew involved (Richard Attenborough, for Pete's sake? Speaking of Petes, Pete Postelwaithe is here, too!), I thought it might be worth a go. And while the cast and crew do a serviceable job for the most part (ranging anywhere from great to poor), it's the script that really kills this one. More specifically, the dialogue. There is a good story somewhere in here (maybe a great story), but the words actually spoken are quite often so trite, cliched and cornball that not even such magnificent actors as Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine can overcome it. Sounds harsh, I know, but it really is that bad, particularly during the wartime flashbacks, which are painfully cheesy. I only sat through the movie to see how it wrapped up and how all the connections worked and everything, but even the ending is underwhelming."
4,You're Free,"This was an wonderful film. It brought together two cultures and two periods in history in beautiful ways. The story was very sad and I felt it told more than just an isolated story. In many ways this was the story of the generation robbed of their youth, hopes and dreams by the terrible reality of WWII. However, the film was also incredibly funny. The Irish added tremendous comical detail, if you got it that is. Richard Attenborough created a lovely piece."
3,Truely sad story,"This is a well put together movie but I can't rate it over a 3 because it's too sad to be overly enjoyable to me.Life's hard enough without falling in love is almost a quote from the movie. Of coarse if not for a war things wouldn't likely turn out that way so you might say war sucks is the obvious message you'll get out of it.To be honest, I've been watching a lot of the OC on soapnet recently & bought this used for the topless scenes of Mischa Barton. If that's what you're looking for you will get a nice direct but short butt & 2 breast (one frontal & one side) shots.I did enjoy the movie despite the sad events but I'd suggest a rental not a purchase. I can't see much appeal in watching it more than once. Used you can buy it for little more than a rental price if you think you will want to own it ... say if you're a Mischa Barton fan & want to check her out now & then but I'd rather just watch the OC myself."
3,Just OK,I am not sure what to say about this movie but it just did not do anything for me. I gave it 3 stars because I love the 2 leading ladies. I just did not like the story.
4,I enjoyed this,"If you love WWII and a good love story with a little mystery - this is for you. I really enjoyed this movie and am so glad I bought & watched it. It had one hiccup on the DVD, but not a biggie. Not a bunch of war scenes, but some blood and guts in the medical units."
2,Strange fit,"The outfit was made for a short, fat baby. The snaps for changing do not completely open the legs, the cuffs remain closed, so changing the baby is difficult. I do not recommend."
5,I love MADISON and SUTTON!!!!!,I have My Scene Night on the Town: Chelsea and Hudson Gift Set. (I play with them all of the time. Chelsea is so pretty and is my favorite doll and My Scene.) I think that Madison would make a great toy. She looks like Beyonce Knowles. Sutton and Madison make a great couple. I love her eyelashes. Her outfit is also awesome. It is so hip. It looks like Sutton and Madison are ready for a night of dancing. I encourage you to buy these dolls. I love Madison!!!My Scene ROCK!!!!!!!
1,I HATE MY SCENE!,"It makes me mad- Everyone is sayin' that ""My Scene"" Is better than Bratz and Barbie..Can you not tell how ugly these dolls REALLY are!!???? And they come with really lame, cheap accessories whilst the Bratz accessories are the bomb! And Barbie is like the queen of all dolls...No other doll will EVER EVER EVER be as popular as her!!!My scene is soooo ugly exspecially Kenzie!!!(I'm not kidding!)"
5,Great Stories From Robert E. Howard,"This, the second volume in the series, is an excellent book. Every story is good, and three of them-- ""Skull-Face"", ""The Moon of Skulls"", and ""The Hills of the Dead""-- are superb. Howard is just as fine a story-teller when he writes of something other than Conan. The _Weird Works_ series is shaping up to be an essential collection of his most entertaining and thrilling stories."
5,More REH please!,"This, the second volume in the Weird Works editions, is another fine addition to the body of Howard's works. Containing 9 stories and poems, it continues the marvelous printing of REH's work in the order of origional publication. Most have appeared elsewhere but some, such as""The Fearsome Touch of Death"" have not appeared in print since its publication in Weird Tales. And the poems show that Howard was not only a master of action/adventure tales but also a very accomplished poet. As with other publications in this series, this volume should be in the library of not only the hardcore long time Howard fan (43 years for myself) but the new fan as well.Do yourself a favor...pickup these volumes."
2,Another Midford Rip-Off,"I'm sorry to have to give another negative review to one of Katherine Valentine's books, but again, this is just a rip-off of the Mitford books. She even has a big, unruly dog....just like Jan Karon's books! The characters are such obvious copies of the characters in the Mitford books that it becomes a real annoyance.And again, her version of Catholicism is a little skewed. She acknowledges several priest friends in the preface to her book....did she get them to read it carefully? For example, she refers to ""The Sacred Heart of Mary"". What?? It's the ""Immaculate Heart of Mary""....we only refer to Jesus' Sacred Heart. These and other errors just jump off the page to an even moderately well-educated Catholic. ""Rent A Nun""???? Give me a break."
5,It will have you believing in miracles...,"I loved ""A Miracle for St. Cecilia's"" and couldn't wait for this, her second book. If Katherine Valentine keeps writing so convincingly about miracles, I just might become a believer!"
2,A Disappointment,"Though I had looked forward to reading this book based on Katherine Valentine's first novel, I came away from it disappointed and even a bit disturbed. Initially, I was pleased to see Valentine addressing tougher questions about God, faith and suffering; but as the novel progressed it seemed as though every distressful situation was miraculously remedied by the presence of an angel or the rosary at the center of the story. While I realize that this was part of the plot device--people being inadvertently touched by holiness which then passes by--it nonetheless completely voided any realism in the novel whatsoever. And I, too, was troubled by ""Rent-A-Nun"": it conjured up the notion of indulgences and seemed to invoke the very worst stereoptypes about Catholicism. In terms of stylistic merit, I continue to prefer the Mitford novels, which are so artfully put together while deceptively seeming simple and which address difficult issues of faith in a subtle yet revealing fashion."
2,Unbearable,"I never like when they can't get the original voice actors back, and Patrick Dempsey was lukewarm, at best. The relationship with Koda was whiny, and the love story, while sweet, was completely predictable, even for our 4 year old. All-in-all, just kind of pathetic. If you do purchase or rent this, you might as well have some fun with it, and pick out all the blantant rips-off of other Disney films. Spot Pocahontas! Mulan! Beauty and the Beast! Tarzan! and many, many more!"
5,Great movie,My kids and I really enjoyed seeing the 2nd movie. We thought it was really well done. A great story and love the songs. Thought it was better than the original
2,Brother Bear 2,"This movie definately wasn't as good as the first one and the first one wasn't as good as it should've been. This one is very cheesy. I think it was made just to make money. I hate those kind of movies - sequels and prequels made just for the money, no love put into it. And the voice actor for ""brother bear"" is different - I like the one from the first movie better. And the story is also cheesy - the first movie, in a way, brings a few tears to your eyes. Gosh, the first movie was sad, but it was cool."
3,worth the buy if you like the first,"Not quite as good as the first, but my son still loves it. If you can find it cheap then buy!"
4,Brother Bear 2,"The two moose are back! They are in love with the female mooses. They try to say something to them. They are shy. Kanai was dreaming about when he was young and he had a girl named Nita. She going get marred in the village. But no luck. She go to find Kanai Who is now a bear to distroy the amulet. The new adventure with Nita, Koda, Kanai."
4,Warm movie stands out from other Disney sequels,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie at a screening at Comic Con San Diego and I have to say that I was delighted with the film, despite a few shortcomings.The point of the film is simple and cute: rediscovering old love and finding new friendship. It's well executed.The music was catchy, but featured the same four-chord progressions. The songs seemed the same to me. Also, there is also the problem that I felt the first movie had: the songs are sung in third person (someone offscreen is singing them and they have no impact on the plot of the movie). I wish that there would be at least one song that the characters sing, but this is not the case.Overall, a very cute movie that stands out from the monotony of the earlier Disney sequels. Perhaps Disney is maturing as it ventures more into the world of making sequels (something that Walt Disney himself vowed would never happen)."
4,"In some ways, this is better than the first",This is a little lighter than the first movie (the whole death scene from the 1st one was a little much for a cartoon). Very enjoyable.
4,Well done,"If you enjoyed Brother Bear, you'll definitely enjoy Brother Bear 2. I'm always curious about sequel movies, because you never know if they're going to disappoint (most of them do) or if they'll live up to the original. This movie definitely lives up to the original. It's fun, entertaining, and is moving. Melissa Etheridge's tracks for this movie are really nice too. The theme of this movie is love, sacrifice and friendship. It's great. :)"
5,Fun for young and old!,Great fun!! My 6 year old and 10 year old both love Scooby Doo. Mom and dad do too!! We all enjoyed this movie.
5,Scooby is the BEST,I loved Scooby as a child and now I'm getting my daughter into the Scooby Doo Movies. Any Scooby Doo movie is great...all are a must have in your collection.
3,sent a different version; made w/cheap plastic,The one rec'd wasn't quite what I purchased; the version I ended up with was even smaller than the one in the pic... (both grey)... pegs were also diff colors... first time we played we had trouble with the pegs in the upper section falling out constantly and we were at the Table (NOT traveling!)... so we aren't as happy with this as hoped.
4,Good for travel,"This might be hard to play in the car, but it comes with a carrying case, which makes it easy to tote around."
5,Childhood Memories,This is what I played growing up and couldn't find it anywhere until now. So much fun even as an adult.
5,"Even if you don't like Grimes' other books, READ THIS ONE!","I am no fan of Grimes' Richard Jury books, but somehow stumbled upon Hotel Paradise. This book makes my top 100 list. Why? The narrator, a girl about ten, lives and speaks just as I did at that age. The mystery is almost secondary as we live and strive along with each charactor. Totally riviting."
2,"It took a long time, but I finally finished reading it!","The first Martha Grimes book I've read...I found the book boring. I should of went with my instinct and read only the first 100 pages, but the thought that ""it HAS to get better"" kept me reading. Unfortunately, the book didn't...only made me hungry...very descriptive food passages!"
2,Cloudy and Windy,"The main character of this book is a twelve year old girl. One would not, however, know that if the author had not told us. Written in the first person, the language and vocabulary are not even close to typical for a twelve year old. The plot is, at best, sketchy and has no moments of excitement or suspense. But the final blow is that, at the end of the story, the reader is left wondering what really happened. There is no climax or clarity to the plot. The plot is ""cloudy"" and the author is long-""winded."" Perhaps the main character is reading a story and imagining the scenario set forth here, but that is not clear either. It is a long book, over 400 pages that goes nowhere very slowly. One redeeming characteristic could be the development of the various personalities, but this is overshadowed by the major obscurities of the book. This author has written several more books and I will read another in the hope that this one is her only dud."
1,Boring!!!,This book is soooooo boring. And I usually LOVE Martha Grimes but this book is excrutiatingly slow-paced and pointless. The pace better pick up and soon or I'm going to abandon this book or conveniently lose it somewhere. I'm on page 120 and this is torture. But I don't give up easily so...I'll read on. Big Sigh.
2,doesn't fit properly,"Although my 5 year old son still loves this bedtopper, it does not fit his bed properly. It may be because it is an older bed. The bedtopper leans to the side all of the time. I did remove the headboard of the bed before putting the bedtopper on because I had read other reviews about the bedtopper ripping if stretched too far. I think that this item is OK if you have a young child who doesn't really care how it actually looks. My son is just excited about it being Spiderman."
1,Terrible. Avoid.,"If you think you're getting studio tracks, you'll be surprised. Beyond mostly live versions, several tracks also seem to have been dubbed from LP's, and poorly dubbed, whith hiss and distortion. On top of it, tracks are mislabeled. Worse than an amateur bootleg."
2,Cheaply Made product... worst service,"This item is a cheaply made stand. The service from this company was not good. The item took too long to get here. I called and complained with no results. The item also had some minor damage, but after trying to get it here in a timely fashion, with no luck... I decided too not waste my time any more."
4,Very Interesting,"I got this book after Mrs. Garrett was referenced by Edgar Cayce. I am diving into this world and trying to learn as much about it as possible. Mrs. Garrett is a very facinating person and has many perspectives concerning the paranormal. This book was difficult to navigate at times and tended to digress a fair bit. I felt that Mrs. Garrett had many insights and I believe her to be a very gifted medium. I hoped for more information on how exactly she would go into her ""trance"" but got the feeling she herself was not quite sure. She is also lighthearted in her approach and maintains that she and we could all be crazy...lol. I like the fact that she did not take herself to seriously and I think this aspect of her personality only gave her more credibility.It's an interesting read."
4,Awesome CD,"What an amazing recording.. You can't beat Andre Watts. Be aware that this is a CD, not a DVD which was the search I had entered."
1,Could not get past 30+ pages!,"When I was ill, i could not stand to read a book, now that I am better I finally found a book that I could not stand to read even when I was well! So much looks positive about this book, an adventure tale by Marlon Brando, and yeah even though we cannot judge a book by it's cover...the cover looks great. Then I made the mistake of opening it and reading the words. There were a lot of words, and they were strung together, but they hardly made a thought or point. Whatever story there is herein is lost to me, and trying to read five pages was like trying to get through a difficult textbook reading. No point, no plot, no direction, no good character development...no sense going forward. I usually finish all my books, good or bad, I plodded through this for days...no joke - days...and hardly made it past 30 before giving up. Horrible."
3,So-So,"This book really didn't do anything for me - parts of it were okay, parts of it I could have done without. Overall the book is a little odd and while probably the whole story seems unreal. This is exactly what a Marlon Brando book would be like if you were to think of - which stands to reason as he co-authored it. Brando's use of profanity seems out of place at times and almost as if he is using profanity just to use and takes away from the novel. If you are a fan of Brando then you will probably like this book, otherwise if you get a chance to read this book read it (the story is 230 pgs) but I would not go insearch of this book otherwise."
1,&#65533;berfl&#65533;ssig,"Lasst die finger von diesem film! Nicht, dass es an guten darstellern mangeln wrde, auch die story wre eigentlich nicht uninteressant (wenn auch nicht neu), nur leider ist die geschichte so langweilig in szene gesetzt worden, dass whrend des ganzen films nie richtig spannung auftritt. Zu langatmig und uninspiriert pltschert diese rosemarys baby-adaption vor sich hin. Fr eine twilight zone folge htte es gerade noch gereicht."
1,Just plain awful.,"Not even Johnny Depp could save this mess. The Astronaut's Wife is a boring,pointless film that works better than sleeping pills. I kept asking myself, ""Why make this film??"".The Astronaut's Wife is basically a re-make of an old 1950's cheap Sci-Fi film, minus the unintentionally funny dialog. Its not scary and nothing really happens in the film until the very end, when the ""terrible secret"" is revealed.Do yourself a favor, pretend that you never heard of this movie."
1,Horrible and Boring,"This movie should be 10min long because that's how long it takes to tell the story. Husband goes to space, alien takes over his body, alien gets wife pregnant, woman fights alien husband. The end. I can't tell you how many boring and pointless scenes there are in this movie that have nothing to do with story or character development. After the woman finds out she's pregnant she goes to talk with other pregnant women who are talking about getting their feet rubbed. Charlize Theron is horrible in this movie. She has no personality and doesn't show any acting ability until the last 5min of the film. She walks around completely bored throughout the entire movie. You learn that her character ""sees dead people"" which has nothing to do with the story. Johnny Depp is a great actor but he really has nothing to work with in this movie. It's just horrible. I can't believe I watched the whole thing."
1,Great actors=great film right?,"There is a simple equation in Hollywood. Great actors= great film right? In the case of this horrendous take on the alien movies, it combines things from every alien plot you can think of and blends it with a not-so-original storyline and an all-star cast (which at the time probably didn't seem to shabby). The movie takes you through a long, boring, kiddie coaster ride, that starts slow, rides slow, and ends slow. Not impressive at all. THe movie ends, and you realize that you just wasted your last 10 bucks. The movie fails to please as a sci-fi thriller, and gives extra-terrestrials a bad name!"
2,Gets worse with each passing minute.,"Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space. Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly slow pace, rambles on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending. This is most notable for featuring Clea Duvall, which makes it three films the actress has been in where people are possessed by extraterrestrials (the other two being The Faculty and Ghosts of Mars).* 1/2 out of *****"
1,Astonauts Wife,"I was expecting much more than this pitiful excuse for a movie. The only thing I kept looking foward to was the end of this film. The acting was poor, the story line was pathetic, and the director attempt to wow us with wierd camera angles and annoying sound effects just made me hate this movie more. This movie is one of the most boring films I have seen recently and would not recomend anyone wasting their time watching it."
3,A Shallow But Honest Review,"O.K. the movie wasn't that great. It was alright but just average. However, plot aside, I would watch this movie again and again for one thing: the sheer beauty of Charlize Theron. Wow, can she look any better in a film? The phrase ""doll face"" was invented for women like Charlize. Just looking at that lovely face ""made"" the movie for me, plot be damned. I would and will watch this film again just to see her face. Shallow, maybe but honest and heart felt!"
2,Unexciting Science Fiction,"Pretty people, decent acting and sexy. This should have been a reasonably good film but, unfortunately, it wasn't. The tale is a hackneyed retelling of other 'conquest by space aliens' films and is slow-paced at that. I found this a film in which I was waiting for a truly original 'gotcha' moment but it never comes. Instead it plays out like one of those demonic-horror films in which a possessed child--the anti-Christ--is born to an innocent woman. I'm truly perplexed. Surely all the truly interesting possibilities of a 'conquest from outer space' haven't been played out. Why can't the writers figure out some new truly interesting twists?"
3,not a bad film...i liked it,i just watched this film last night and i gotta tell ya....it's not bad.it kept my attention all through out. wasn't bored at all.will i watch it again ? yep. :D
4,Darkly Provocative,I really like this film. This film is slow and deliberate. Johnny Depp is such an interesting actor you become immersed in the film just on the performance of his character. This is really modern filmmaking based on old-fashioned story telling. It is very intriguing and has been unjustly underrated.
3,What was with the ending?,"I am not particularly drawn to science fiction and being a fan of Johnny Depp's range as an actor, I still had no desire to see this. It was on one night and my husband wanted to watch it so there I sat, sure I was going to hate it. I have to tell you that the movie was quite suspenseful and the acting was superb. I found myself wrapped up in and even afraid of Johnny Depp's character. I was mildy impressed. Then came the end. What a way to ruin a great movie. So predictable that you didn't even see it coming, because it was such a good film up until that point. It's like you watched this great movie and the end comes and you're questioning yourself as to why you watched it all. It was so disappointing. It's worth watching for the performances and the suspense up until that point. If you can get over a really lame ending, you might enjoy it."
4,I couldn't stop thinking about it.,"I watched this movie when it was on TV one night. This was when I hadn't even heard the bad reviews. After it was done I just sat there. Ususally, I can tell I really like a movie by the way it sticks with me. Throughout the whole week, I couldn't stop thinking about it and I knew I had to get it.The acting was fantastic. Sure the plot was well..stupid. But I can't really take any movie with aliens seriously. The reason it only recieved 4 stars was because the ending was awful. I really hate it when a great movie is ruined by the ending. But, what are you going to do? If you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will enjoy this movie. Like I said, the acting was great, the mood was suspenseful and it really stuck with me. That ending is just an unfortunate circumstance."
1,Mystery? What mystery?,"Glad I caught this one free on TV. Surely I'm not spoiling it for you if I say that the ""astronauts"" impregnate their wives with alien babies? Snore...I figured that out 10 minutes into the movie. What a painfully boring movie this is."
1,"Well-thought of plot, but acting makes it terrible.","What in the world is wrong with Hollywood these days? If this is what filmmaking is coming to, I'm afraid of what the future holds. There is nothing good to say about The Astronaut's Wife, except that it succeeds in flopping majorly due to the emotionless acting and flat dialogue. Johnny Depp with a southern accent? Please. Another aspect to look at is the absence of chemistry between Depp and Charlize Theron. Not only do their words have no meaning, but they sound forced and consigned. There is not one scene in this movie that will convince you that these two people are truly happily married. The emotional meaning in this film is about as astounding as Johnny Depp's southern drawl. Don't get me wrong: this movie could've been a brilliant cinema had the acting not totally sabotaged it to nothing. The DVD is a winner, though, if you want to waste time and money on this flopper."
2,If you're a Depp fan...,"If you enjoy Johnny Depp, this is a must see as he seems to carry the movie. Theron handled the emotional scenes well, but as a whole, it needed character depth and a coherent plot. The reason I gave it 2 stars as there is no violence, limited use of profanity, and only one embarrassing sex scene."
2,Made for TV?,"The movie seemed like an extended, somewhat glossier version of an Outer Limits episode. Not that bad but not enough substance for a full length movie. Pretty predictable.And then there those obvious references to an older, classic horror film....The location? Ms. Theron's hairstyle? I must agree that this is THE worst film I've ever seen Mr. Depp be part of! If you're in the mood for an OK TV show, you won't be too disappointed."
1,Every bit as exciting as its title...,"Rarely have I seen so many relentlessy arty shots in support of so little story. Ashamed to be reprising the cruddy little 50's sci-fi flick ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"", the director apparently decided to remake ""Rosemary's Baby"" instead -- but he succeeds only in proving what a thin line there is between the sinister and the absurd."
1,I. think there was something wrong with the DVD!,"Attempted to watch this on DVD, but it never started properly.All we could access was a semi-documentary about two low-energy (read no-energy) individuals who OH-SO-SLOWLY start to distrust each other since the male half of the ""dynamic"" duo (and I use dynamic in it's un-purest form) seemed to have been posest by a ""jelly-fish wanna-be audio-morph intent on building silly airplanes"".This went on for about 110 minutes too long, which leads me to believe that they couldn't fit the movie on the DVD also. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this one."
4,Only Johnny,"I saw this movie and thought What a really dumb movie with no plot. I can sum it up in two seconds. Astronaut goes into space loses contact for two minutes comes back to earth. Wife becomes preganat, Finds out her husband is different. Babys are aleins.Anyway over all I did like only because of Johnnys Performance. Playing a southern suducter. To just being plain hot. His high lights are hot hell he is fine in this movie. His voice is amazing. Only The actress the played his wife played a weak performance and not very good acting. Over all strange Flick but, great hot leading man oh Johnny you are great in every movie no matter how bad.Rent but dont buy unless you love johnny and his hotness loves it lol."
2,could have been so much better,"This was a pretty disappointing movie. When I first read the description and found out Johnny Depp was going to be one of the main characters, I got excited. Unfortunately, his performance couldn't save a rather boring and slow-moving storyline. However, this was one of his older films, and was made before he turned into an extremely popular movie star. If only the plot was actually more interesting, I might have given the Astronaut's Wife a higher score."
3,No depth but fun for kibitzing,"An astronaut has some sort of weird experience in space. He comes back acting funny. Does any one notice? Not until he really goes off the deep end. How will it all end?Just because this is one-dimensional and predictable does not mean you can not still say ""stay in the car."" And you don't think having twins is spooky? Rosemary's Baby never grew up to be a pilot. Yeah, and such common names like Spencer Armacost; what ever happened to Igor or Jeffery Dhalmer? They put in quiet space so you have time to think about what happened (or did not happen) and you call it dull. Do you really think that they would intentionally make a bad movie?Interestingly enough the actors including Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron for better or worse have made some memorable movies. So it is interesting to speculate how they were lured into this particular film."
3,ehh not so good,It's okay but could of been much better. Good plot GREAT ACTOR Charlize is alright but needs a better haircut. But the twins are the kids from Big Daddy! How cute! and i'm referring to the VHS version
3,Only Let-down is the Screenplay.,"Take ""The Devil's Advocate"", turn Satan into an Alien, make it a little more boring and you have ""the Astronaut's wife"". The film is great to look at, the cast are all great actors (though they don't all prove it here. You get the feeling that Johnny was saving his real skills for Sleepy Hollow). The Director proves he is Competant, the only let-down is the Screenplay. It takes far too long to get where it's going and when it finally makes it to the climax, it's over with in just over a minute. Other than that it is enjoyable enough and ... Charlize Theron looks stunning!"
3,enjoyable enough,"It's good to forget what the critics say sometimes, and watch a movie with an open mind to form an unbiased opinion. That's what I did with ""The Astronaut's Wife"". Charlize Theron was excellent in her role. It's sort of a modern day ""Rosemary's Baby"", not as perfect, but the suspense and the thrill are there. The movie begins kind of dull and humdrum, yet the suspense broadens as the story advances. All in all I enjoyed it. I'll watch it again someday, too."
3,Good acting film.,"Johnny Deep has died in space, then a life force take his body and his memory. Nasa lost contact for two minutes and in space with the another astronaut contact them back.His goal to make his wife pregant and he need his own kind to make a space ship from their design.Slow moving film but every boring, good performances from Deep and Charlize Theron.I rate this film 3 Stars."
4,The best Sci-fic movie I've ever seen!,"Most viewers said this film was bad, but to me it was pretty good. I don't usually get sci-fic movies but I actually get this one. If you like horror, love, and space movies check this movie out. This movie is about a perfect all-American couple. Spencer Armocost (Depp)has died in space, then a life force take his body and his memory. NASA lost contact for two minutes and in space with the another astronaut contact them back. His goal to make his wife(Theron) pregant and he need his own kind to make a space ship from their design. ~~~~~I ACTUALLY GIVE IT 4.5 STARS!~~~~~"
3,So So,This was a ok film. But it wosent the best I have seen. This movie would probally be ok for a rainy day or if you like sci-fi movies a lot and are into aliens.But if you are not then I would not recommend this film for you.
2,Another Mediocre SF flick,"This is a nice-looking movie with a good cast, but the pacing is fairly slow and anyone who has seen more than a dozen SF movies will not find any new ideas here. It's fairly obvious from the beginning how the plot will develop, so there's little in the way of suspense. The ending is no real surprise."
2,Actors save the day,"The biggest problem of the film is, that there are no new ideas in the story. There are a lot of holes you can't ignore, a lot of incidents you can predict. The Ending too is not very surprising. Most of all, I ask myself why the things that happen are so bad. What is so bad about the twins? I couldn't find anything. For me is a lot senseless. But there are also good things in the movie: Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron are great (as usual). They made me forget that there were so many bad things about the film. There are also a lot of exciting scenes, that have the right tempo. But all in all, I wouldn't recommand ""The Astronaut's Wife"" to my friends. Only the actors save the day."
1,I Thought I Was Lost In Space,"Do yourself a favor and miss this flick. Johnny Depp returns from space after a trivial incident ('we lost contact for two minutes'-oh my!) and spends the rest of the film walking around acting like he's waiting for something to happen. His wife, suspicious of him for unknown reasons, might or might not be nutty. The other characters are barely in the film at all, although the obnoxious society women are the best part. I guess there was supposed to be some doubt as to whether Johnny Depp was an alien or not, the screenwriter seemed to think there was, but I didn't. The add campaign, which included some revealing dialogue which was apparently cut from the film (perhaps to maintain the imaginary ambiguity) left little doubt. I kept thinking, ""Yeah yeah, he's an alien, can I go home now?"" I spent the whole time waiting for the movie to start, then it ended."
2,REVERSAL OF THRUST,"Could have been much better with Charlize as the Astro. Lovely sets,lovely costumes ......eye candy and all of that.Could really have been more fun if we already had 'some' of these jellyfish' aliens living amongst us ......Overdone and recycled....."
2,Touching Ice,"The haircut gave it away. Charlize Theron is Roseary a la ""Rosemary's Baby"" but instead of the Devil up to his shenanigans, it's an alien who gets her pregnant by travelling across space as a radio transmission and occupying her husband.Johnny Depp is suitably vacant as the possessed spaceman. The movie riffs a little on female insecurities about pregnancy and the impossibility of men and women really understanding each other. It's a case of men being from Mars, etc.There's little to connect to emotionally in the movie and this is not helped by the director's cold minimalist aesthetic. This movie is as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla, but now and then you feel a little heat like what is produced by touching ice."
1,"Ooh, look at the lovely lighting","An interesting premise is ruined by a director's desire to make a name for himself through imagery.If you can bare to keep your mind switched on, for what must be the dullest film of all-time, then you'll see some beautiful design and cinematography. Also in shot you may see the deadest actors this side of 'Zombie Flesheaters'. I like Jonny Depp as an actor and, being male, I like Charlize Theron too but... God knows what they were thinking.I've seen my fair share of boring films but they can usually at least prick my attention with a little fast-pacing every-so-often but, as I said, the film is simply a long string of nice looking but inconsequential set-pieces.Watch Abel Ferrara's 'Body Snatchers' instead, for a relevant update of 50s B-movie ideas."
3,Hidden Trailers and Special Thanks,"From the main menu, select 'Cast & Crew' to get to the filmographies. Then select Johnny Depp where you will find a filmography entry for 'Don Juan De Marco' with a trailer for the movie. On the next page of Johnny Depp's filmography you will also find a trailer for 'A Nightmare On Elm Street,' and under Charlize Theron's filmography you will be able to view the trailer to 'Trial And Error'.---Scrool down and highlight the new line logo and press enter to see special thanks"
2,Rosemary's Twins,"Not a good buy. I purchased it and watched it on a Sunday night. This movie got a lot of bad reviews from profesional critics and movie watchers, and I am afraid they may be correct. Overall I do not regret buying and watching this movie. Some movies are good, some not so good, and some are terrible, but how can you judge the good one from the bad one if you never see the bad ones, therefore give this movie a chance and you be the judge."
1,Not even worth one star.,"This is the most stupid, dumb, pathedic excuse for a movie in the history of Hollywood. I was excited when I rented it, only to be completely disappointed in such a pointless movie. The acting is bad, the storyline is completely dumb. The ending was horrible. My dad and I were disgusted after watching this. It wasn't even scary. My adice, don't take 2 hours of your valuable life to waste on this horrible excuse for a movie."
1,Boring and Predictable,"This was a horrible waste of money. It is slow moving, anti-suspense, and uses a very predictable plot that could have been played out and summed up in under 10 minutes. By the end of this long drawn out snooze-fest, you are saying to your TV ""Please, just die already, just end this movie"". If you are bored and it comes onto regular tv, ok, maybe watch it. But I wouldn't recommend even paying a $1 rental fee for this one."
2,2 Starz being a little generous too...,"Astronaut's Wife is a whole lot of hype over nothing. I really expected better, but it turns out that the movie is one of the worst ever for Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. The movie tells the story of an alien taking over a human astronaut's body and procreating with the astronaut's wife. A story I seem to here variants of over and over and over again....Yep, 2 stars is VERY generous..."
1,A very pathetic waste of time very lackluster ploit.,"It's ashame that director think that we wanna watch really bad movies.But whatever this director was thinking when he made this pathetic waste of film was abviously thinking he was so bored he may as well make this thing but what a waste of time because by the time you figure out the ploit if you figure it out your begging for someone to put you out your misery ,but hey when your out of sleep medicine by all means put this in and youll fall asleep pretty dang quick."
2,Could have been really good,"This film is a let-down, I like Johnny Depp and i usually think Charlize Therin is very hot and a good actress, in this film Depp is wasted and Charlize Therin, is very ugly looking(she looks really bad with the short-short hair)The plot insult's you A plot about aliens taking over Depp & another astronaut and impregnating their wives-Which is a total waste for the very pretty Donna Murphy who blows Charlize Therin away in her short scenes in this film. Instead of seeing Donna Murphy's charater impregnated(which would have made this film better)we are only told after she commits suicide, that she was impregnated by an alien, instead we see Therin get impregnated by Depp, and her Running around acting stupid and getting everyone killed for her ignorance. save your time, only rent to see Donna Murphy.Then turn it off after her character dies."
2,silly little movie,Astronaut's Wife tries hard but it's just too silly to be taken seriously. Johnny Depp is fine as Spencer an astronaut who may be possessed by an alien but he's stuck with Charlize Theron. Although she gotten much better as an actress and went on to win an Oscar this year in this role she's ghastly. She was evidently directed to do an imitation of Mia Farrow ala Rosemary's Baby and falls flat partly becuase she's got to work with dumb lines from a poor script.Having said all that the movie is entertaining if you enjoy throwing popcorn at your TV and yelling insults at the actors.
2,Give me X Files series anytime,"This movie is so-so, something that I would only watch when there's nothing else for me to do. The movie is suspensful enough but once the viewers manage to figure out where it's going, it's becoming a bit stale. I do feel that the movie is built upon from a very simple premises & therefore, there's only so much that it could go. The on-your-face scary moments are deliberate as we have seen in other horror flicks. I couldn't help noticing Charlize Theron once again played a victimised wife, as she had done in the Devil's Advocate. To be truthful, the atmosphere of the movie is similar to something that's come out from X Files, even its open ended ending. Well, you would spot its uncanny resemblance with X Files especially when the credit starts to role (its font & background is exactly the same. The only absence is X Files theme song). Well, watch it if you need to but don't buy it."
1,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED!,"I don't usually make it a habit to write reviews about movies I can't stand - because the interest and enthusiasm just aren't there. However, for this movie, I'll make an exception! This movie is TERRIBLE! As someone else so eloquently put, I WISH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE IT ONE STAR! It's draggy; the writing is dull; the characters might as well be made out of plastic; and it's not even scary or suspenseful in the least (and trust me, I'm someone who scares VERY easily)! What was with Johnny Depp's hair and accent? Pukesville. And what was with that woman's shorn head? Not attractive. Suffice it to say, I can't find a single good thing to say about this boring,ho-hum of a film. I can't even comment about the end, because I FELL ASLEEP! I'm just glad I rented the movie as opposed to buying it!"
2,Stars over substance.,"I was really disappointed by this movie. I thought this was going to be somewhat of a sci-fi movie, but about the only action in the film occurs near the very end. I guess I shouldn't have been too disappointed; the title pretty much says it all.The film revolves around the astronaut's wife (played by Charlize Theron). I was so bored by the opening half of the movie, that I never learned the characters names, I didn't care anything about them. Her husband (played by Johnny Depp) is in an accident in space, but after a brief hospital visit he makes a full recovery. Nevertheless, his wife notices some subtle changes in his behavior. Things aren't exactly what they appear to be.This movie portrays itself as being a type of sci-fi movie (and it was labeled as such in the store I rented it), but it is really more of a thriller along the lines of WHAT LIES BENEATH (a far superior piece of cinematic magic). However, there isn't anything thrilling in this thriller."
1,A complete waste of time,"This movie didn't do a thing for me, the plot was stupid, no special effects, and wooden acting. It adds up to truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen!"
5,The Astronaut's Wife,"Despite all of the bad reviews this movie has seen, it IS an excellent film. The acting is very well-done (by ALL cast members). Every actor took on the role in their own realistic way. This movie is far from perfect, but the only real downside is that it's a relatively slow-moving film. However, it's very realistic non-the-less."
4,A bad movie?... I don't think so.,"Why everyone say that's a bad movie? Because it is?... One movie, in this case, a Sci Fi movie, must'nt have a lot of special effect's to be good. I think the story, and the way she's told, are very good on this The Astronaut's Wife. The idea of an extraterrestrial inteligence moving across the space, trying to find a body to survive it's very original, on my opinion. The story it's not obvious, and perhaps that's because the most part of the people dont like that.Not interesting? Because it's not like de Star Wars?... Baaaaaa"
1,Total waste of time,This film ranks among the 5 worst films I've ever seen. The story drags along and you just can't wait till it's over. I thought that Johnny Depp would be a guarantee of a certain level of quality. What can I say? - I was wrong!
1,The Vastness of Space Can't Hold the Awfulness of this Film,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw it for FREE on cable this weekend ...I'm only writing this review as a public service.Having your mind wiped out and replaced by that of an alien life form that travels through space via radio waves (I'm going to give away as much of the ""plot"" here as possible, people. If I can convince just one person from watching this movie, I will consider myself a better person)is a preferable fate to watching this movie, for if your mind were wiped clean, you wouldn't remember the horror of having to watch this film...It's TERRIBLE. It's AWFUL. It's poorly written, horrendously paced, characters act and react with absolutely no logic, and, worst of all, it's not the least bit scary.And this is DEFINITELY not one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies. It's just BAD,period.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
4,Easy to install,I really like the way these set off a yard. We used them next to the walkway and to frame a garden. They look really nice. It was very easy to put them in the ground. I just tapped them in with a mallot and that was it. I was done in no time and have received many compliments on our landscaping.
2,it was okay.,The price is cheap and yes it look cheap. Made of plastic. If only I could see this in person before I buy this..I will not buy this at all. This don't come with any pins to secure it to the ground.
2,Not so easy,"I had a difficult time getting some of the pieces together all the way down. When I pounded harder, they would bend out of shape. Also, I couldn't get it to work per the instructions, i.e, putting one piece in the ground and joining the next one to it. I had to put them all together before hand and then put them in the ground. Also didn't go into the ground very easy and if I got one side in, it came back out when I tried to put the opposite side in. Finally settled for getting some of the pieces into the ground and leaving the others on top of it. Hopefully, it will settle in before it blows away.I have had the edging for several months and I still can't get it in the ground. I am replacing it with cement edgers and have changed my rating from 3 to 2."
1,Cheap but thin,Cheap in price so you get what you pay for. Trying to hammer it into the ground it just gives way and flexes to much to be done properly. Only way to use it is to dig a ditch first and that takes away from simple installation. Buy better quality edging.
4,A History of Modern Russia--Readable and Insightful,"I purchased this book to ""fill in the gaps"" since my college survey course over 35 years ago! I wanted to ""catch up"" as I was on my way for a 10 day visit in the hinterlands of Russia and would be not in the ""tourist"" mode but observer mode. This book was easier to read than many history books but did provide insight and accurate historical data. It was especially useful in that while I was in Russia, Putin was very much in the news in the US and Russia, though from very different perspectives! Reading this book, helped me understand better the Russian view which was very different from the US view!I highly recommend this book for background information on Russia."
2,History of Modern Russia,"I did not like it at all. It was extraordinarily long, and there was way too much detail on many uninteresting facts. He used many peculiar, elaborate words that I think he made up, and I couldn't find in the dictionary. The editing was dreadful--some incomplete sentences and some very poor punctuation. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!"
4,Book on yoga exercises .,I saw this person on television and thought it would be interesting to do I regret that I have not even opened the dvd yet but eventually will.
4,Excellent Yoga CDs,"I saw Peggy Cappy on PBS and decided to buy these tapes. Her voice is very soothing and the instructions are easy to follow. However, some of the poses are very difficult for me as I am 65 and have never really exercised before. My bad!After using the cd for backs, I noticed that I felt better in just one day. Not ""cured,"" of course, but noticeably better. The sunshine salutations are also very good, especially the ones using a chair for someone like me . . . these are on the tape for poses to help the heart. I have not looked at the cd for arthritis yet.I notice it is best to watch each cd all the way through first (the parts on the poses) because sometimes when attempting to do the pose, it is difficult to see the tv screen. She does go a little fast at times, but then I go back and review the poses and do them slowly, and that helps. I would definitely recommend any of Peggy Cappy's Yoga cd's!"
3,Yoga for the rest of us,Ordered because I already have the DVD for easing pain. These are good but a lot of start and stopping throughout.
4,Not bad....,"It must be remembered that even a ""minor cantata"" by Handle is well worth the listening. This ""old"" recording was done in 1984, around the time of the 300 year Bach/Handel birthday bash when many obscure and forgotten works were performed and recorded....thank goodness!The only real problem I have with this performance is diction. English does not appear to be these singers 1st tongue. And the counter tenor is not the best I've heard. Still, what other recordings of this complete work are available?There are many beauties here: The series of arias with concluding chorus ""Come, blooming boy""/""There is the brisk sparkling nectar drain"" [a great aria!]/ ""While for thy arms that beauty glows"" is wonderful; The trio ""Where do I go"" and the final chorus are most worthwhile.The aria for Virtue where she insists Hercules will ""listen to my awful voice"" is fine despite the fact ""awful"" doesn't mean ""full of awe"" anymore.This is not a work to be avoided."
2,Aged recording of minor Handel cantata,"Arleen Auger, Alain Zaepffel and Eberhard Buchner conducted by Max Pommer with the Leipzig New Bach Collegium Musicum."
4,Playground,This is a great setup for young children; it has lots of different parts that you can connect in many different ways. You can add on to it or just assemble part of it. My grandchildren are loving to crawl through it!
5,"""Tent city"" is awesome","I setup all the tents in the carpeted basement every month or so, for a couple days. My 5 year old daughter will crawl through it all and play baby dolls for hours. The cats and the dog will run through each section exploring too. Collapsing each section down takes a bit of time to get a handle on how to do it. After a few times, I can break it all down and get it all back in the box without trouble. It is a twist and tuck motion you have to learn to get it to fold up just right."
5,My son is still playing with it after 3 years!,"We got the ultimate playland for my sons 1st birthday. At first the ball pit was his favorite by far, then he started crawling around in it. His cousins who are 1 and 3 years older loved it too. It was great for his crawling too. Sure, part of the fun was collapsing it but it holds up well. It was a nice safe fun toy that grew with him and is still part of his toys, actually the only thing he still plays with from the 1st 2 years!My son is 3 1/2 now. We still have the set and although it is not set up every day it still gets played with regularly. He will pull out the bus part one day and play with it, then another day it is the gold part, or the tunnels & yes his cousins still love it too. It is one of our great indoor toys he still loves.Was it worth it? Was it a great long lasting toy? You bet it was!!! It has held up great too. It is not hard to fold and store once you are used to doing it."
3,Children enjoy....,"Both my 6 year old and my 1 year old enjoy this playland. My main problems with this is that many of the huts do no have flooring in them and therefore are hard my their legs as we have tile floor. The tent like walls are decent, though not as hardy as we would have thought. The golf game portion of this is basically useless as it is not setup well. My children just enjoy chasing each other around in the tunnels and tubes and especially enjoy the ball pit. All is all I would buy again."
4,BIG fun ball.,"My four year old loved this ball. It has since deflated, but he got a lot of use of it this summer. I'm thinking his older brother got a bit rough with it but all my kids enjoyed playing with it. It really is big."
4,Cute Couple!!!,"Ohhhh, I love this toy. This 2 dolls are really cute, and if you like Barbie and River, you should buy them. Barbie has a weird hairdo. She has short hair and long curls. River is cool, but he has just one shirt. That's really dissapointing. But, buy them, they are cute."
4,Hair trouble...,"So i just got these dolls & barbie is more beautiful than ever-she has creamy frosted lip gloss, gorgeous eye paint & the best part-ROOTED EYE LASHES! also her outfit is so far the most beautiful My Scene ensemble for barbie(same goes for Madison & Chelsea), & she has bendable knee joints.now here's the catch:the dolls hair is a wreck!& it wasn't just the doll i bought, all the dolls had the same hair.it looks great on paper, but it's like, short with long curls, but the curls are matted & ratty. i had to restyle the hair somewhat & make it presentable.Mattel should have been more responsible before they released this doll.it's still good though, better than wave 3 Barbie i guess."
3,my scene barbie and river,this is almost my favorite out of all three exept i don't like river that much well it's his hair but i am working on that barbie is gorgeus i lllooovvee her hair and her outfit is awesome so are the accessories and oh i don't know barbies knees are bendable and river is full bendable exept his ankles and wrists but it is a real good choice
4,Tuneful wry amusement,"I discovered this Australian group late with ""Oceans Apart"" and have since been building my collection going back in time. ""Bright Yellow Bright Orange"" is a joyful set from their come back, with wry lyrics and a soft rock musical overlay."
4,Warmer Colors,"The release of each new Go-Betweens CD, especially after their decade long hiatus, is a cause for celebration. Bright Yellow Bright Orange is no exception. Though not as full as their ""comeback"" The Friends of Rachel Worth, Bright Yellow Bright Orange is a warmer Go-Betweens record -- similiar in tone to Liberty Belle and the Black Diamond Express. The new band does less for Forster and McLennan's songs of life and love in the middle ages than Sleater-Kinney's rhythm machine on Rachel Worth, but that may be musicians still in the process of getting to know each other. No matter. These tracks unfold slowly, the way novels do, the way all great Go-Betweens songs have always done, and continue to do. They could release great records every few years forever. I hope they do."
4,where is everybody!,"has anybody picked up this recording yet! i guess another musical gem from a gem of a band looks to be under the radar. ok about the record, only the best work Robert Forster has ever done on a go between record ! Grant, well, I dont think its his best work ever but pretty good mclennan is better than most pop rock writers. c'mon where is everybody this record is excellent! put on your headphones and listen!"
4,Better on DVD!,"I originally bought the VHS of this movie and loved it enough to pick up the DVD. This low budget vampire movie looks even less low budget on DVD. It is a much cleaner picture. The supplimental material is interesting as well. I found the commentary track amusing. It wasn't filled with a lot of techno-babble about cameras and film but more like the director was in the room hanging out with some friends. if you've seen it on cable or picked up the tape, I HIGHLY suggest picking up this nice DVD version of the movie. Where's the sequel?!"
3,Amusing at best,"This movie had bad acting, a bad plot, and even worse writing. The 100 minutes seemed to last for hours, and I almost didn't finish it. One thing that was worth my watching it was Kinka - whom I know personally. Yeah, Umile! :D"
2,Not for me,I started this and could not get interested. But it may be fine for others. I will try to get into it again.
1,waste of money,"I can't believe this company is still in business. My children bought me one for Father's Day, spending more than they should. It sort of worked for one year and then, once out of warranty, totally died. The assistance from the manufacturer was a waste of time, repeating what was already on the accompanying CD, and of no help. Two other family members also had Mosquito Magnets and neither of theirs worked beyond the second year."
1,Works great until out of warranty,"I've gone through two of these. Will never buy another! They both failed the 2nd year. Repairs cost almost as much as a new unit.Basically, their ignition system is very unreliable. All the fancy LEDs only tell you it is broken!"
1,it works it works well but it always breaks down and repairs are very expensive,"When this unit works it does a great job of catching lots and lots of mosquitos. Unfortunately it usually only works for one or two tanks of propane (about 6 weeks) before it has to be sent in for repair. I have had one for 3 years now and it is the same old story every year. I wish the company that built this would hire some good engineers to solve their quality problems because they might end up with a great product then, In the meantime it is an over priced good idea with very poor execution."
1,Customer Service,"I will NEVER recommend this product to ANYONE EVER! The customer service is terrible. I have gone through 3 different head units for the defender. This is the 4th one that now does not work. I purchased a replacement cord at the cost of $40 + shipping. Before purchasing, I was informed I could return it if that was not the problem. When I called the customer service department, they said it could not return it because it was an opened package. The package was openned when I recieved it. It was never sealed in a sealed box, for all know it is a defective unit. But I cannot do anything about it. They were oh so kind to offer a $50 discount on a new unit. Big whoop! I still have a 5 pound paper weight sitting in my house that I have to be enviromentally conscience about and take the time to dispose of it properly instead of the company taking some responsibility. They are definitely losing a customer."
2,"Once they break, they can't be repaired","I bought one at first - loved the results (big bag of mosquitoes and noticeable reduction in the yard. Bought a second (we have a large and long yard) and the first died before the end of the Summer (would not complete warmup). After trying a bunch of things with customer service, they replaced for free. Half way through the second season, the second unit died (same symptom). It was out of warranty, and I would have been happy to pay for service, but no deal - the company has no repair service. Now we are on the second year for the replacement first unit. I'm waiting for that one to break, but it is still catching lots of mosquitoes. I want to love this thing, but a year of mosquito catching for $500 is a bit steep. If they repaired these units after warranty - even it broke after the first year and the service was for a (reasonable) fee, I'd probably give it 5 stars. As it stands though, I can't recommend these units at all."
1,Save your money,"Very POOR investment. The first unit lasted 3 months. A replacement unit was sent. The new unit lasted almost three months to the day. Oh did I say NEW unit no they only send out rebuilts. There is a one year warranty on the original unit ONLY, when you receive a replacement unit no new warranty is issued, what ever time is remaining on the orginial unit carries over to the rebuilt. Oh did I say I live in Wisconsin. Well our summers are only three months long, so the rest of the time the unit is NOT used. So thier one year warranty is really only a three month warranty. Big price tag, expensive upkeep, but I must say it when it was running it did work good. Way too expensive for lasting only THREE months."
1,"American Biophysics is bankrupt, assets sold","Goggle the Providence Journal then search for the Mosquito Magnet. Otherwise I have nothing new to add. I just experienced the same problems as everyone else, high co$t to operate, very low catch rate, dead second season. I think the unit killed more bugs when they accidentally ran into it in the dark (after bitting a drunken human)than ended up in the net."
2,Great Idea.....Terrible execution,"First let me preface this review by stating that I am an ASE certified ( Automotive ) master mechanic with 25 years experience and was an aircraft mechanic for ""uncle Sam"" in my younger days. Suffice it to say I know a little bit about mechanical devices. The concept behind the mosquito magnet is very good and when it works it works very well. The problem is in the execution of the design. This is a very unreliable product that lasts on average about a year and a half. When it breaks repairs are very expensive. The other problem for those of us who are mechanically inclined is that the company REFUSES to sell repair parts under the pretext of ""safety"". Imagine if Chevy or Ford refused to sell parts. What do you think the Federal Trade commission would do? Perhaps the FTC should order a mandatory recall and compel the company to replace the defective parts at their cost, not ours."
1,Doesn't Work The Majority of the Time,When it works which is only 10% of the time it does catch mosquitos. However your costs for the attractant and maintenance products and time that it spend broken is not worth the cost. Call their customer support number and they try and sell you more products to fix your broken unit. They want a $155 to replace the unit with a reconditioned one.Don't make the mistake I did because I regret it.
1,Mosquito Magnet Liberty,I bought a new Liberty..It worked for two propane tanks then quit.. American Bio sent a reconditioned liberty.. It worked for about two tanks.. American bio sent a new liberty.. It worked for about two tanks.. Now American bio says they will send a reconditioned one for 159 dollars..I paid over four hundred for the first one.. Terrible investment.. Worse than the casino.. M. Goleman
2,The MM does work but beware,"I purchased the Liberty MM in 2003 and I loved the way it worked until the end of this summer,2006. The unit trapped mosquitos like it said it would but these Mosquito Magnets are not made to last for long. To get the unit to work on start up is very difficult and time consuming. The tech staff are very good but the engineering stinks. Dont bother trying to fix it either,its expensive so just purchase a new one if you like it that much. Again it will clean up your area of pests but its very fickle and not for those who aren't good with technology."
1,Ripoff,"I have tried two of these and like everyone else the units do not complete warm up cycles, error after error, and their support line, while pleasant, is useless. The worst purchase I have ever made. One star is being kind and only because they don't have a zero option."
1,"Bad Quality product, 2 year life or less, good when works","I now own three American Biophysics Mosquito Magnets. The oldest one I have is two years old and cost me about $900 to purchase. The two year old unit no longer works, so AB technical support wants to sell me a replacement part for $500 or you can buy a new unit, after returning the Power pack, for $425. What a racket. Build an expensive product that doesn't last more than 2 years and then charge a lot to fix or agree to buy another unit that also has shoddy quality. I agree it catches the mosquitos that they claim when it operates properly. But because of the cost of the units and their limited life I would not recommend this product unless you have a lot of money to burn."
1,Save your money,"This product had a nice web site, good ""info"" and lots of promises. It worked a little the first year, althouh never enough to require me to empty the bag -or- deliver anything NEAR a mosquito free yard (we live on a suburban 80'x125' lot and the unit claims that it can handle alot larger area than that.) The unit STOPPED working the second year, and when I logged in the manf web site I found out that I was a week late in being able to participate in their ""free replacemnt program"" (thanks for nothing), I then learned about the magic reset tool, which took three requests to get to me, and then it made no difference.SO, the unit sits in a storage shed waiting for a garage sale. If I can get $25 for it I'll be lucky.After talking to fiends we'll be installing a perminantly mounted system this summer.Wish I'd saved the money, but may be I can helps someone else not throw away some."
1,Unreliable,"I was as enamored as a blood-hungry mosquito for this technology when I bought a Liberty in May 2002. Now, 3 failed power packs later, with a dead power pack AGAIN, on hold to &quot;consumer support&quot; for 30 minutes with no answer so far, I have to concede that the technology and/or manufacturing is not mature enough to reliably produce this backyard paperweight. Maybe in a few more years, or with a new manufacturer. In any case, for the present, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,a total piece of junk,"the mosquito magnet is a collosal mistake unless you feel that $30 per mosquito is a good deal. it would be a better result to hire a service to come monthly for the cost of your octenol and propane alone. let alone the $1000 for the unit. now that it is broken, they want $395 to fix it. they will coddle you along until the warranty expires saying that you have the wrong type of mosquito or some such rubbish. do not buy these units."
1,Poor results,"After a rainy spring and summer, the mosquito population has exploded in my backyard (located in Massachusetts). The Liberty has been running for about 6 weeks and the net has claimed only about 20 insects TOTAL. You can stand in the backyard and swat more in 5 minutes than this thing has caught in 6 weeks. (This includes changing the tank, CO2 and attractant at 3 weeks as recommended)."
1,do not buy,"do not buy this unit, unit is obsolete and can't get parts, the parts that are available are expensive, you can get a lot less expensive way to controll insects."
1,Be careful where you guy,This misquito magnet was listed as new. It was used as received. It failed on it's second tank of propane. Not recommended
3,"works ok, not great","We bought one for our home, and based upon other reviews we read, it was advised to purchase one larger than what is recommended. (We bought the 1 acre size for our 1/4 acre).It does help with the mosquitos, but it does not eliminate them. We change our propane tank every 21 days, as recommended, but I am still covered in bites.You also need to make sure that you have the right ""food"" for the mosquitos. The cartridge that comes with the unit did not work on mosquitos in our area. A quick trip to our local outdoors stoor corrected that.Overall, we're satisfied b/c it does help. But it's probably only catching a 1/3 of the mosquitos in our yard."
4,"Works, but high cost may deter some buyers","I'd give this 5 stars if it didn't cost so much.Was catching the vile critters within an hour of set up.We're catching dozens per day now. Maybe more. It's hard to tell. Anyone know how long it takes the little vampires to dry up and die?I think we're going to try the bug-zapper combo as a couple others have mentioned to try to catch even more.Overall we're pretty happy with it. Set up was ok. The instructions were a little less than adequate however.It's a costly system to slow down the infestations of skeeters - not just initially, but over time with bait, gas, replacement nets, etc. But with West Nile, I figured the cost is somewhat justified."
1,"A Magnet for Mosquitos, but Kills Nothing","I purchased this product on clearance at Home Depot for $129, a price that seemed too good to be true until I put the unit into service. The unit came with Octenol, an attractant that doesn't work at all in my region. After buying a package of Lurex, the MM began to attract mosquitos by the hundreds. In fact, they were landing on the Lurex cartridge and on the rim of the trumpet. Unfortunately, the MM's fan is so underpowered that mosquitos must fly far up into the trumpet before they are sucked into the bag. In my case, only three mosquitos were unfortunate enough to do so in a three day period.This unit is a magnet for mosquitos, sure enough. Unfortunately, all of the mosquitos it attracts escape its underperforming sucker and end up biting me. It's practically criminal that this company can sell this unit for nearly $400! In my opinion, it's completely worthless and it's going back to the store.Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere."
1,Waste of money,"The science behind it is good. It ran good for 4 months, it caught bags-full of mosquitos. I was happy.Then it quit working with a ""gas flow"" fault, just like everyone else reports.Done everything I can and it will not work. I really like the unit and the science behind it. The system is just poorly designed.I bet $1,000 bucks that the CEO of this company don't use one. Otherwise they would have fixed them for good.This really WAS my last resort. Then it failed.I'm back to fogging.JS"
1,Bad choice!!,"I live outside the USA (Brazil)I've believed the information at Mosquito Magnet website about the product quality.I put my unit to work three weeks ago. For my surprise it stopped working. Three lights are on and I've seen this is a problem with a piece called ""ignitor"".So I dont have a local assistance and I must import this one.I was not expecting a poor quality."
1,I feel as if I was taken by a fraudster.,"I purchased two Liberty Plus units and cannot get either to work. I have followed the instructions with extreme care, mulitple times. I switched propane tanks, I purged, I cleared the system with the cartridges and so on. I wish I could provide more details for readers but the simple fact is both of these units will not start. And that is brand new right out of the box. Prior to purchasing I did the normal reading of reviews but out of desperation vis a vis bug bites decided to gamble. It was the wrong decision. I've never given a one star review but this product deserves it. Please be very careful when deciding. This product is not the way to proceed."
3,Broken in two months,We purchased the Misquito Magnet two months ago and the ignitor is not working. While it has cut down on the amount of bugs in our yard (1/2 acre)we find it hard to believe that a part could fail so easily. We have placed it in the yard away from children and their daily activities so that couldn't be the problem. The one plus was that the 1-800 customer service people were very quick to respond and eager to solve the problem. They will be sending us a new replacement part but it will take at least 14 days which means it is out of commission for the balance of the year. They are having production problems. Seems a little odd for such a new item.
1,Doesn't work after a few months,"I have three Mosquitio Magnets that I bought last year. They worked great for a few months then only give ""fault"" indications thereafter and won't work. This is a defectively designed or manufactured product. I have never submitted Amazon reviews before this product. I feel so cheated that I want to warn others about it. Three bad devices for me, and many other reviews reporting the same problems, means that you purchase this product with great risk.Thankyou."
1,Not all that effective,"I had this model when we lived in Maryland. We have a large, beautiful yard what we can't use due to mosquitos. After researching all the competitive brands, we went with this one. In terms of construction, this is very solid. The including ac adaptor has an exceptionally long cord, which is much appreciated. We experimented with different locations in the yard. I was real disaapointed at how few moquitoes were found in the net. After 3-4 months of use, there is no appreciable decrease in mosquitoes, and we ended up dumping the machine."
5,Awesome Product,"This thing works...the people that say it caught only a few mosquitos in 3 months must be doing SOMETHING WRONG. Ours caught 3000+ mosquitos in the first 5 days. It works like they say it does, and works well if you follow the instructions (perhaps therein lies the problem for those people who are dissatisfied). You just have to position it correctly. I can't believe how well it works, I never thought I would be able to rid my yard of mosquitos like this, totally awesome!"
1,Not good,"How can you write a history of Latin America and not write about the Haitian Revolution or Haiti in general? Simon Bolivar was educated, inspired, and helped by the Haitians to free South America. Totally irresponsible history."
5,Excellent Introduction to the Subject,As someone who always wondered about Latin American history - this book offered a superb introduction. It combines a broad sweep over the colonial period with briefer country-specific essays on the post-colonial histories of the the larger Latin Anerican nations. Reading it one gets a good sense of the common heritage of South America.
4,Exhaustive introduction to Latin America,"This book is a testimony that Mr. Williamson can be rated as a top notch literary critic. He is also a good English Historian. So here you have it: he combines the sensibility and mastery of language of a man of letters with the rigor and deapth of knowledge of an academic Historian to give us an introduction to Latin America through her history. What results is a complete and readable synthesis of the main currents in Latin politics, economy, society and literature.Mr. Williamson's underlying thesis is that of the search of Latin American societies for Modernity defined as a democratic, liberal and self-conscious state of affairs. The history is therefore roller-coasterish. But then Mr. Williamson will make your ride enjoyable."
2,Rolling dice and writing comics,"Maybe Ed Hannigan played a lot of Dungeons & Dragons in his childhood. But League of Justice, an Elseworlds tale, certainly has its root in a host D&D; and early 1980s pulp fantasy novels.Four normal kids -- three upstanding young camp counselors and a ne'er-do-well thief and junkie -- are inexplicably summoned to another world where knights and sorcerers and monsters fight for supremacy. After being saved in the forest by a Jack o' the Green variation on Green Arrow and his mystical Bird Lady, the four set out on a quest for various heroes -- the Batmancer, the Amazon Princess, the Hawk Lord and others -- to fight the evil Sovereign (Superman) so they can try to save the kingdom.Hannigan, working with Dick Giordano, supplies the art, which is good, solid stuff. But the story is hokey. By the end, I had to wonder how many plot points were solved by the roll of a 20-sided die.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"
5,Dr. Jesus,"I mean no disrespect here. This book is all about what Jesus would say if He was your counselor in todays world. It is informative, timely wisdom that never gets old or outdated. A super read for the seeker of Christian wisdom."
5,The Greatest Psychologist Who Ever Lived IS Mark Baker,Dr. Baker is brilliant. This book settles many age old conflicts between human society and Jesus. It should be required reading for all ministers of the true faith. Truely it is a jewel in my collection.
4,"my daughter loves it, but..","my daughter loves this castle,but the draw bridge has broke.so i bought another one.same thing has happened.my only complaint.besides the draw bridge being flimsy everything else is sturdy and made well."
5,"Great toy, great price!","it's better than i thought from the photos. i like how it's appropriate for both medieval adventures and more fairy tale-like play. most castles i found were scary and violent looking, as well as being large hunks of plastic that have to take up room in your house. we like how this folds up for storage and the soft wood feel. also a plus is the different play areas... the staircase, the drawbridge, the dungeon, the throne room, the wall and guard tower. the 3 figures that come with the set leave a lot to be desired. they are very ""arts n' craft'y"". we purchased some realistic knight figures by Schleich which work well in the scale of the castle. actually the scale is better than the figures that come with the castle."
4,Quite Nice,"I enjoyed Voltaire all throughout college and vowed to read more of his works after I graduated college and could once again read materials that I wanted to read.I was almost turned off and put the book away after reading so much anti-semitic writings. Then, I took it with a grain of salt, understood that Voltaire was no different from his fellow man on the matter (in the 1700s) so I just kept reading.I am glad that I did for his attacks rolled away from the Jews to many more subjects. A delightful read with a tinge of missogyny, deism, anti-semitism and of course a few old and outdated ideas like these.What is more important is that Voltaire's writings influenced the Jacobin revolution that swept Europe after it devoured France. Kudos Voltaire!"
3,Philosophical Dictionary,Voltaire is one of the greatest philosophers that ever lived on earth. Even today his writings are so relevant and they surely make to much sense still so there's nothing old-fashioned or unfamiliar in any page!Candide is his masterpiece but for a start I would reccomend you this lovely essays book that will certainly make you wiser once you finish reading them.
2,Voltaire Dictionary -- liberally edited,"While I, too, enjoyed getting a Kindle freebie, this bears little resemblance to the original (I am fortunate to have a first English edition from 1765). I was hoping to have a Kindle version much like the printed copy, but found that many of his more enjoyable and interesting topics (especially religious) were omitted by your editors including Abraham, Angel, Baptism, Beasts, Body, Chinese and Japanese Catachism, Christianity -- the list goes on and on. Why such a different version might have been explained with your translator/transcriber notes in the Kindle version."
1,Disappointed,"I expected this book to be a copy of the original version, not a shorten version of it (like a 1/4 of the original size!).Extremely disappointed."
2,Nice for a Hipppie,"If you're a hippie and like your books to have an incense smell and talk about hindu prayers and cliches from Golden Age India, and think that you can get by as a Sanskrit student by knowing some Sanskrit words, get it! If you're a serious student and really want to learn Sanskrit stick with Coulson or Maurer. I have almost all the books available for learning Sanskrit..."
2,"A good books perhaps, but not in ebook format","This book may have much to recommend it in print format, but the translation into ebook format is lousy. The devanagari characters are quite small. My guess is that they were treated in the conversion process not as text but as graphics, and so they do not respond to ""Change Font Size"" commands. Even when you can enlarge them, they are smudgy and indistinct. What this book deserves is to be re-typeset, although at the time I'm writing this (5/2012) I'm not sure the technology can yet manage all non-Roman scripts well. If you can't get your hands on a hard copy, I'd search for another product to learn Sanskrit."
3,For Serious fans and historians of science fiction,"Didn't care for it. The writing just didn't draw me in. The story ideas were sorta good but the authors corny / dumb down naming of objects and peoples cheapens and dates it badly (1955-66). Examples: Fighting Trees (trees used to absorb and neutralize radioactive contamination from past wars), True men, Wise Old Bear (failed bear to human mutation), Unauthorized Men (failed dog to human), Brainbox, Helen America, Mr. Grey-no-more, Sailors (meaning astronauts), ""Up-and-Out"" (space), ""Clown Town the underpeople place"" ........Like others say, and I agree, this is for serious fans of C. Smith and/or historians of science fiction."
5,"Short stories, long-distance vision","I first encountered Cordwainer Smith thirty years ago. The book was ""You will never be the same"", a collection of stories, all of which appear here ""The Rediscovery of Man"". I have never read a more aptly-titled book. Smith's writing, while not ""hard"" science fiction, exemplifies the finest aspirations of the genre. Smith's stories are inventive, evocative and deeply moving. This is a great book to recommend to people who claim they hate science fiction. I would call it literature. Read it. It may not change you, but it may change the way you think about science fiction."
5,A service to poetic sf,"I was overwhelmed to find this compilation several years ago, though it took my local bookseller (not on the web then) a month to contact NESFA (and we're only 30 miles away) and get it. It now sits on my bedside bookshelf, and is regular reading. Not only is this a unique author and gloriously poetic style, we can be thankful to him for another. In writing of her own experiences coming to be an sf writer, Ursula leGuin cites Smith's stories as a part of what brought her (also very poetic) voice to the field. For all of us who grew beyond BEMs and intergallactic cabals, a hearty thanks to NESFA (who, I have discovered, have done it again with a Zenna Henderson collection!)"
5,"""...the work of Cordwainer Smith cannot be duplicated.""","The wild, wooly world of Cordwainer Smith refuses to die and why should it? His stories, scattered like pearls amongst the genre magazines of his time, now come home to roost in one volume. If you don't know him, you probably won't buy this book but once you enter his world, nothing less will do. Go ahead and opt for a lesser volume of stories - the world is filled with great stuff we don't know about but I hope you don't pass Cordwainer by. You've missed a lot."
5,"Timeless, original, and engaging!","When I read the short-story Scanners Live in Vain, I was bowled over. I could scarcely believe it was written over fifty years ago. By creating a future so divorced from our present time and so unique in it's voice and details, Smith had succeeded in writing a story that would retain it's startling freshness. But Smith's ""Instrumentality of Mankind"" stories have more than just staying power: they are very powerful and intimate reflections on the human condition. I also highly recommend Cordwainer Smith's novel ""Norstrilla"". Cordwainer Smith inspired Robert Silverberg to write science fiction. -nuff said."
5,One of the best,"If you are a fan of Cordwainer Smith (nee Paul Linebarger), then there isn't much reason not to own this book. It is a handsome, fairly-well bound edition with a lot of his best works inside. Smith's mytho-poetic science fiction sagas are as fresh today as they were last century.An amazing selection for either newcomers or old fans."
5,a great visionary,"Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger, alias Cordwainer Smith, remains a great visionary of a future nicer and more equitable toward all beings than the present ignorance we are experiencing now. I am always moved by the tremendous empathy, insight and decency Smith displays toward all beings whom we take so terribly for granted as mere objects in our world today. This is a book for any dreamer who awakens to a dawn wondering why he is on this planet at all. To all of Smith's writings, always, a full five stars."
3,Good Story,"A very good story, well written. Not all of a great author's books can be equally great . This book is very good but not as great as Cannery Row, East of Eden, Grapes of Wrath,. or Travels with Charlie."
2,Poor Packaging,This book was smashed into a flat package that was extremely difficult to open. The cover and some inside pages are bent. The back cover is halfway ripped off.
3,The winter of our discontent,"I will be anxious to hear what my book club has to say, it was a sad ending. The author did create a very interesting character."
4,Winter of our discontent,I love this book. I am only 16 and still in high school and my incredable english teacher made us read of mice and men and I loved it so much i went and read this it is stienbeck is now my favorite author his work is just amazing if you have more than 2 brain cell you can grasp the feelings he is trying to express. my only problem is that every book he writes ends with every one dead? what is that about?
3,"Overall, didn't work for me","This book is short, but it seems to plod along. It feels forced, as though Steinbeck was straining to write about normal people when possibly he couldn't relate to them anymore. The characters are O.K. But nothing like the characters in the other books I have read by him thus far: Grapes, Eden, Cannery and the Pearl. Basically I was disappointed. However, I will still seek out more Steinbeck to read since most of the other works I have mentioned were so monumental. Every writer is allowed a dud here and there, especially one who has such an amazing track record."
2,Book fell apart on first reading,"I order many, many books from Amazon and this was the first time I was disappointed. I knew the book would not be in perfect shape, but I didn't expect it to fall apart from the first time I opened it. Each time I opened it to read, more pages fell out. Very disappointing. The book did come quickly and was packaged very well."
1,BOGUS!!!,"There are NON-PENGUIN versions listed here; this specific listing is for a Penguin Classics version of ""The Winter of our Discontent"". You could have people asking for refunds from sellers who have errantly listed the non-Penguin version.If the sellers are listing non-Penguin versions then they're liable. Misrepresentation!"
4,The Winter of Discontent,"Wonderful story! In being written by John Steinbeck, it would have to be. Criticism: too much detail; on and on about one particular thing; very distracting"
5,WINTER OF DISCONTENT,You may have read this when you were young. But it is a wonderful re-read as you get older. I could hardly put it down. I re-read 3 of John's books this summer and what fun! They relate to today as well as when they were written.
5,a great bok that makes you think.,This was my first Steinbeck novel and it was amazing. It real made me think about what I believe. It's so realistic and anyone that has opinions on life should read this book. You'll love it.
3,"Steinbeck, but not the best Steinbeck","John Steinbeck is one of the greatest novelists in American history and all of his work deserves reading. But The Winter of Our Discontent is far from his best work. Even his shorter works such as Mice and Men and The Pearl are better. The basic plot is trite and overdone in literature. A ""good"" man is tempted to compromise his morality for personal gain. The story itself drags as the characters spend a lot of time talking and musing. There is relatively little action. Even the ending is murky. Read it if you must, but read other works by Steinbeck first."
4,Too Much Literary Pretensions,"John Steinbeck is easy to teach, but he's not much fun to read. ""The Winter of Our Discontent"" is over-laden with religious symbols and metaphors that have little meaning rather than to be just present. The plot seems contrived and artificial: the protagonist's transformation from saint to manipulator is too sudden, and isn't quite believable.Nevertheless, the main themes of this book -- the corrupting power of money, the diabolical ways of the rich, the sacrifices of good individuals -- are even more relevant today than they were fifty years ago."
5,An American saga... in miniature,"This book is a perfect way to become deeply enveloped in the psychology of a loveable man grappling with the temptations of corruption, greed, and adultery. The characters are vivid and personal, and often we are privy to their most intimate- and amusing- thoughts. Steinbeck is a master of recreating the essence of a culture, and he successfully creates this New England town which remains steeped in its own quaint history despite the increasing infringements of modern life. As with much Steinbeck, it is the characters and the culture that make this short novel great, and I highly recommend it."
4,Worth Reading,"I recently listened to a Steinbeck book for the first time on an audio book. I liked it a lot so I went to my own bookshelf where I have several Steinbeck books (all unread), one being the Winter of our Discontent. I had started to read it in high school years ago but never finished it. I found The Winter of Our Discontent to be interesting and thought provoking. If you're thinking about whether to read it or not, my suggestion is read it. I think you'll find it worth the read."
5,"By far, one of Steinbeck's Best","I read this book for American Lit in college. Since then, I have read it 3 more times. There is something about the main character and what happens to his life that is just so very....haunting."
2,A big disappointment,"As one who loved The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was excited to revisit Steinbeck after quite a few years. Reading this book was simply painful. I didn't like the characters, the prose seemed to drag, and it just didn't ring true. I never accepted the premise, that Ethan would change from a good and decent man to a deceitful one who turned on his friends and colleagues. Most of all, I didn't care what happened! There was the occasional brilliant phrase but I was so bored that I could barely appreciate it. I must have read a different novel than all of your other reviewers."
1,Outrageous price,This price is OUTRAGEOUS for a Kindle book!!! It should be much less for one I can't even share with others!!
4,Nice but small,I wanted something that would keep my toes warm without making me sweat. These would be perfect if they were bigger. I'm a size 9 and it takes a few days for them to stretch out to my size. Forget them if you have larger feet. Size 9 feet would be the absolute max that would fit in these.
1,Not for emergencies!,"Look closer! The BIG RED BUTTON is NOT the emergency button as one would think from the description of this item. The emergency button is the small red button along with all the other buttons in a row. This is NOT a good emergency phone, and especially not for seniors. I had researched and thought I understood this phone, but only after opening and reading the instuctions will you see the difficulty in using, and then it cannot be returned."
1,"yep, it sucks","What is uo with this album? I mean Korn is coll but this album makes Korn look like a crappy band. Songs like Here to stay, got the life, blind, falling away from me are the worst of the whole album. They sing so horrible and it sounds like kidz bop. Stay away from this! Buy korn greates hits instead. If korn heard this album, they would tackle and punch any body who was involved in this."
1,Stay away from this,"Korn has been a band that I have respected since their first album. No other band has ever been able to show such intense emotion and anger that sounds so honest and sincere. This tribute album takes some great korn songs and ruins them. It sounds like the bands on this cd maybe heard the songs they are performing once or twice, and then said to each other, "" How can we destroy this song."" Stay away from this cd, it is a complete mockery of the greatest band in metal."
2,Are you serious...?,"I have no idea what that was supposed to be. I survived the whole album, though Im not sure how. I realize it is a Tribute album and not a Remix album (the other review got the two mixed up, i guess). Im sure these bands tried their hardest to put something together for one of the greatest groups around, but it just didnt work. Maybe they sound good with their own stuff, but this just isnt the right genre to be toying around with. Its like giving an infant the keys, expecting it to park the car. Some things just dont mix...."
4,Good Gasket set,Good gasket set. Materials used are superior to many sets I have seen.Gaskets are cut accurately and fit well.
5,A Scholastic Miscallany: Anselm to Ockham,A very thought provoking book. The writings of Anselm especially moved me as he argued the case for God and how He is alive working in this world. A true treat as you look into the minds of early Christians scholars in the 12th and 13th century.
2,Video picture quality is NOT good -ruins the viewing,I agree with the other reviewer. The picture quality is grainy and poor for such a good sitcom. You would think the licencers would have done a better job for the grant to reproduce the show but the picture quality just plain sucks. Only buy it if grainy poor quality is not as important to you. The other similiar made videos of All in the Family are the same type quality I imagine as the other few tapes of the show I bought are. Licensors-you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing reproduction like this quality.
2,Not recommended,"In first place the recording quality is poor, no reverb. It sound like playing in a small room. Is not a ""musical"" version of the caprices, all are played so fast and not clean. There are so much out of tunnings, specially when he plays chords or difficult pasages. For example caprice 2. Caprice 3 is horrible, with bad intonation and very exagerated vibrato. Rabin's vibrato is so exagerated in all CD, so much exagerated, sometimes disonant. Other detail: all pieces are played with constant beat, like using a metronome, like etudes. (So bored!!!!)A gave it 2 stars because when he play fast is correct.Nothing else."
5,What a Literary Biography Should be!,"There is no doubt that Rimbaud presents a complex, almost contradictory metaphor for the life of the ""Literary Voyant."" He is embraced by various communities who identify with certain aspects or should I say phases of his life. I have read many essays, books, and bits and pieces on his life, poetry. As a lover of Rimbaud, I feel Starkie has captured the poet as no other. She looks into his mind and sees what others cannot see. This is the real Rimbaud, as real as we are ever going to know him. When I read this book, I always think of how Starkie closed her bio, with a little boat tossed drunkenly on the waves. Don't miss this book. It's what a literary biography should be, unbiased, thoughtful, and intelligent."
3,The mistakes of E. Starkie,"The Enid Starkie biography is a moving and remarkable work. Nevertheless , it has some serious mistakes that the readers and mainly the lovers of Rimbaud must know. Starkie stained the memory of Rimbaud accusing him of having done slaves traffic. Detailed studies have proved that this was absolutely impossible. (You can read the books of Alain Borer, Graham Robb, Charles Nicholl...)Starkie wants to show us a rimbaud that failed in Abyssinia. It seems that he deserved a punishment for having left the poetry. The truth is that Arthur Rimbaud was an excellent trader that made a little fortune.A few moths ago I went to Charleville. There, the Rimbaud's museum has a place where important studies about Rimbaud are shown. In spite of the Starkie's play is very well-known, it has not earned a place there."
1,"maybe the product is wonderfull, but...","I didn't receive the book. I'm still waiting for it.The adress is correct, just the delivery isn't.Wanna buy something? Go to the store.I'll never buy here again"
1,did the writer of this book give himself good reviews,because i did not like this waste of paper one bit!
2,"Very superficial, I got more doubts then answers from this book","The author is probably an excellent archer, but he could not put the knowledge in this book. He does not go deeply into subjects, write small texts for many subjects.He tells great histories about archery and some interesting situations of his life, but that's all. When talking about technics, bow, equipments there is no scientific explanation. For example, the say that a option A is good, but B is also good, so you decide, but doesn't give you any more information to help you more."
1,damaged merchandise,product arrived in a damaged condition due to poor packing and rough handling by carrier. Hose reel returned and credit promply issued and received.
1,Awful Customer Service Sent damaged product & won't respond!,Ordered Sensories Purify Cucurbita Tea Tree Shampoo and received item. It leaked in the box and the Shampoo is visibiliy faded and lacks the fresh scent/odor that makes this shampoo unique.Would like a pre-paid return shipping label and guarantee they will refund my original shipping costs!
2,Great music but poor collection,"Note that this CD only has 2 songs. There are only 5 tracks, the first 4 of which are remixes. While the music is excellent and I highly recommend getting some from Sunrise Avenue, this particular CD is a pathetic purchase for the price. If you really want 4 remixes of Fairytale gone bad, there are many (29) available on iTunes."
3,A Tiny Bit of History,"An interesting book,, but I would not consider it a classic. A bit of history and a little self-promotion. Good if ytou have nothing better to read.."
3,Slow reading with too much detail when not needed.,"""At Close Quarters "" A little boring like reading a ship log, need an Atlas on the side to understand where events happened. but I did enjoy the history of the boats."
4,Real History,"Actually, but for the indispensable documentation, I would rate it at 5 stars. And, a lot more geographical name places than the newspapers in WW II (which I followed avidly as a teenager) were mentioned, sending me scurrying to my atlas! A great read!"
4,"Exciting, comprehensive","This is about as good as it gets in being complete and thorough. The history of PT boats, their squadrons, their wartime actions is all here in good order from one of their own, who turns out to be a pretty fair writer as well as a combat sailor."
3,Detailed Read,"The book reads like reading actual daily combat reports. Everytime a boat goes out through out the entire book, the author quotes the captains full name and rank to the point your eyes glaze over. On a positive note, you get to hear another and slightly different version of the PT 109 sinking. This book would make a good reference book for a war historian interested in material on little boats operating in the backwater areas of WWII."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"While I don't like to be critical of any author's work, I'm sorry to say that this book did not delivery what I expected. Essentially it's a collection of blow-by-blow descriptions of every PT boat ever commissioned with such facinating details as; when it was commissioned, when it joined a squadron, names of crew members, when they got promoted, etc. Granted some of this information was interesting but after 3 or 4 chapters is becomes quite repetitive and dull. Some of the combat narratives start to bread up the monontony but I found them few and usually brief. I would say this book is ideal for the dedicated Naval historian. If it's important to you to know when 'Joe Blow' got promoted to Captn' or Commander, and when it was decided to move squadron X from island A to island B, this is the book for you."
4,Gives an account of all theaters of operations,"Excellent book overall. It gives a complete story of the actions of PT Boats in all the theaters of operations. i personally never really knew much about the actions of PT boats in other places than the Solomon's. It also gets into the logistics and support for the squadrons , and not just the enemy engagements. The only downside is that it can be a little dry reading"
4,Detailed history of the PT boats,"I was surprised by how involved the PT boats were in the many battles in the Pacific and Europe, besides going after the capital ships, sinking many barges the enemy used, rescuing Down pilots, strafing the shore lines on island battles, transporting guerrillas to various locations and many other tasks too numerous to mention. Sometimes the details were overwhelming But necessary to give credit where credit was due."
3,long but good insight in to PT oats,"Book did tend to jump around. did present good overview of conditions and failures of the system of support which m,ade life difficult. Author tried to to deal with each year's experiences of the crews but did not tie the cronology together so that the reader understood that the boats were used in a different maner . It became confusing when he went from the Pacific Theater to the Med."
4,Lots of history.,The facts that are presented in this book are great. The only problem I have is that they spend a lot of time naming everyone on each boat and each event. While recognition of the men in this history is a wonderful and necessary thing I find that listing everyone for each event takes up a lot of space and causes the events to become a little fuzzy.
2,At Close Quarters,Boring in what I though was a memoir of some of the PT Boat Captains was more of a re-print of Navy Records.
3,Good book with too much filler.,This reads like a naval report. Could have half the content deleted and it would be a great book. even so I enjyed it
2,A lot dry,"If you want to read dry, boring after action reports then this is the book for you. Should have been more written about the sailors who manned these craft instead of just what boat commanded by what officer went where."
5,Donny Hathaway,"One of the most thought provoking artists of all time. Donny Hathaway presents lyrics that bring out the innermost feelings and emotions in us all. You can almost feel the emotions he pours out in both his lyrics and his musical arrangements. ""A Song For You"", ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know"" and ""Sack Full Of Dreams"".... man! The lyrics are both calming, relaxing, and intimate. A perfect mood setter. Stock your cd changer with some of Donny's cds, put it on random, and sit back and relax. But just don't take my word for it! I've also recommended ""Donny Hathaway Collection"" to my friends and told them that I would reimburse them the cost of the cd if they didn't like it. Needless to say... I've kept my money over the years. If you appreciate powerful/thought provoking lyrics and romanticism from a true artist then this is the one."
5,The Renditions on this CD are Worth the Purchase,"I had the cassette of this album for several years before I wore it out. Over the years I've purchased several other Donny Hathaway CDs with different performances of these songs, but I've never felt the same power as the renditions on this CD. The give and take betwen Hathaway and the rapturous crowd gives me goose bumps and makes me wanna shout! No matter how much Hathaway you own, you'll be glad you got this one."
5,Soul of a Man Who sang like an Angel....,"I cannot believe no one mentions the track 'NU-PO,' the only instrumental cut on the album. This is one of the most flowing and smooth pieces of music. A latin groove that just builds with the dissolving and watery Rhodes, Not to mention the sublime Bass of Willy Weeks and the Guitar of Phil Uphcurch (Anyone for Darkness Darkness?).I hear that there's a version of this Album with more Tracks, including a bass solo by Willy on 'Voices Inside.' Re-issue!"
3,Metal Detector,This thing seems to be plenty sensitive enough for casual coin shooting. The receiver doesn't seem to be particularly accurate or else I need additional instruction on pin-pointing location of finds. I seem to spend a lot more time digging up dirt after a find than scanning new ground.
3,Sold after 2 weeks.,"Other reviews were great for this product,and maybe I'm just located in a ""barren"" area for finding things.But I never found any coins which is what I was hoping for..I did clear out a lot of nails, pieces of barbed wire, cans, shotgun shells..I think the product construction is fine, and the shipping was fast."
4,Can't wait!,"Just ordered it today and hopefully I will get it on Friday for shortly after I will be taking a trip to have Christmas early and there are alot of perfect spots for detecting that my family owns in the area XD My main reason I admit was the small coil, better materials, simple maintenance, simplicity, and all the videos I have watched floating around YouTube. When I get the detector I will be going to a local park to use it in the tot lot for hopefully some change and not so much trash."
2,Ok for the money but you can do much better....,I got this metal detector about a month ago and tried it a couple of times. You can find alot of trash with it. I used at the beach and the only thing I found was a bunch of cans. I buried a gold chain about 12'' deep and yes it found it but the signal wasn't strong. Another thing was that the closer to the water I was getting the more beeps I was getting but as I was digging nothing was coming out....weird! I shopped around for 2 months before I got this metal detector and I don't think was the right choice.
2,No Tomorrow big lacker in Master P films,"Master P one of the best in the business ,matter of the fact one of the best to ever run his company ,but I must say he's trying to do too much. This movie had good actors like Pam Grier and Gary Busey who are in the headliners but are barely in the movie also along with Master P. (Big mistake) It surrounded around this one unknown actor wo was a special agent for his country working for Master P undercover who was a big time gangster. Gary Busey was a big time crime lord in controll of weapons and Pam Grier was a FBI agent on the case to crack both of them. This movie a good screen play but bad I must say very bad production it was very low budget the quadilty was bad ,the editing was bad that took from this film capablity of being a great film."
3,"If you are looking for a practical book, this is not it!","If, on the other hand, you are looking for lots of pictures of great riders and equally great horses, this is it! It is a beautiful book with a lot of photographs and very little text. It takes the reader through the 'ideal' developmental stages of dressage but without detail. I was looking for more practical words of wisdom on how to achieve the pictured perfection, but found none."
5,A Spiritual Classic,This book is a wonderful read. I read this book on a cross Atlantic flight and never has such a journey seemed so short. I regard this book as a must read for anyone awake enough to realise that they are on a spiritual path.
1,Dont waste your money...,"I was expecting great things from this book after reading the Miracle Gall Bladder Cure, but I was dissapointed. What a load of new age rubbish. The author may in fact be some way mad!"
4,"Is it thought provoking? Um, yes.","I got through maybe half of the book and put it down for a week. I thought it might not apply to me, that maybe I was too different or too far from that culture for it to feel relevant.In that week, I realized that she was struggling with almost exactly the same questions I was. She was coming to the same unacceptable, or desireable, answers. And she was getting there by a completely different route.I started reading it again.I keep thinking about it even though I finished it a month ago. Perhaps it's a slow-acting book. At least it's working that way on me. Every now and then I get a glimmer of the wisdom that's there.It's a good book. It's well written. I suppose I'm disappointed because what I'm seeing in it isn't magical, cure-all wisdom. It's the wisdom that people gain and use, almost only when it's not easy."
2,Too Long & Drab,"It was dissapointing. It was long and got boring after the first 150 pages. Towards the end, when the Muslim League agenda comes in, it was unbearable. I was reading every alternate page. Nazneen's sister, Hasina's story would have been more compelling and interesting. The protagonist's character lacks depth. Overall, Ali should have kept the book shorter, got rid of the religious aspect and strengthen her characters."
3,No direction,"I was really excited to read this book being a huge fan of Indian literature. Unfortunately, this book did not captivate my interest and I had to put it down after a hundred pages or so. It was very slow going and the plot could not keep me interested enough to read the whole book."
2,Talented author but the book's ultimately unsatisfying,"Life in Brick Lane is captured with an uncanny, almost photographic realism. And the story of Nanzeen and Chanu's life together rings true. Yet the pace is maddeningly slow and the plot disintegrates into predictability. That said, I believe that Monica Ali is a writer who has been blessed with great talent. Unfortunately, Brick Lane is not a great novel."
4,Surprisingly well-written,"This book tells of the growth of a simple uneducated Bengali bride of an arranged marriage, thrown into the a confusing and alien culture of London. She is married to a pompous know-all failure of a man. As time goes by in this novel you see this shy, unsure woman learn and grow and become a person in her own right. This story is about the triumph of spirit of women, family love and commitment."
4,Beautifully Written,May be we can compare this book with Purple Color by Alice Walker. A story of two sisters a distance away writing about religion and family. In fact both are using slangs. One is African American and and the other Bangladeshi.This book is a good bet nonetheless. Beautifully written and coincide with the growing interest on Islam.
2,A Satisfying Ending,"The ending is superb and deeply satisfies the reader. All of the narration comes together to leave an accomplishment... but had I not persevered through the book my initial lack of interest (which spanned for 3/4 of the book) would have won out. Brick Lane takes too long to go anywhere and seems to spend too much time explaining the plot rather than living it. Nazneen's seclusion from the world did not work to the favor of this book and her emotions seem stifled. Hasina's letters seem to be a bit odd in place as Nazneen only seems to be casually interested in them. However, if you can wait out for the last few chapters of the book you will find that it is a quiet gem of a read... though you may not read it twice."
3,could have been so much better,the book could have been very good but it didn't go anywhere. characters were well developed but basically the build up to the end fell flat
2,Booker prize short list?,"Ali's writing is superb and she can describe place and situation as well as most anyone I've read. However, the novel is dissapointing. The heroine has an empty affair and is less than honest with both her lover and her husband. She allows her family to break up, and her children to lose their father (although she supposedly loves him) without any attempt to try to save things. But since she achieves ""independence"" in the process, we are unsubtly pushed by the author to approve. In the end, I felt the story promoted selfishness. The character development was also quite weak. It was an interesting read, but unmemorable and hardly worthy of the Booker short list."
4,Good book and good seller,"Fascinating book. As for the seller, the book came on time and in good condition. The price was reasonable."
1,Drag,"For a person like me, who hates not to finish reading a book, I had the hardest of the time finishing Brick Lane. Not badly written for a newcomer, but I there are so many other books that, I think, describe the story of the immigrants in a better way."
2,boring,"It just goes on and on and goes nowhere. I don't care about the characters. The sister's letters are a chore to read and I end up saying, ""so what?"" I generally enjoy reading about other cultures and was really looking forward to this one because of all the hype.What a huge disappointment."
2,Brick Lane,"This books had many starts and stops. Unfortunately, there are too many stops. Just as the book started to get interesting, the reader is lead back down into dismal descriptions of a dirty apartment, drug use and all-around hopelessness. I, luckily, borrowed this book from the library just I didn't feel as I wasted my money. I think the book would have been so much more interesting if it had been written with the sister's view and her story, albeit a little more realistic. However, this book was too long, boring and depressing."
2,BORING,"Do yourself a favor and pass on this book. Could not care about the characters, story just seemed to go on and on. It was way too long which just increased the pain."
3,Interesting Read,"Although it was interesting to read about the Indian community in England post 9-11, I could not connect to the characters as I usually could."
3,"Colorful, but disorganized","Monica Ali does a wonderful job of transporting the reader into the Bangladeshi community in London and, as other reviewers have said, the characters really come alive. That said, this book would have benefited from an editor's red pencil. It's disorganized and repetitive, and many of its jokes - like the bumbling of the heroine's husband - go on long past their sell-by date. The post-September 11 section about Islamic radicalism feels tacked on, and given the book's 2003 publication date, I suspect that it was. This book has enjoyable moments, but better editing would have made it a better whole."
4,A good read,"Not much depth to it but the story line was good. First book I've ever read about Bangledesh so I found it interesting culturally speaking. I won't describe it as exotic, that's too patronizing. The descriptions of food made me hungry."
2,Dull and duller,"This book keeps your interest for the about the first 50 pages and then just disintegrates to the point where you just don't care about the characters. It was downright muddled, at times.It was all I could do to finish it."
1,long... pointless ... boring,"This is just another depressing book about South Asians. I have to admit I only got half way through, so maybe the end was better, but I tend to doubt it.I got the book on CD - listening to the whiney South Asian woman reading it was painful."
2,Disappointed,"Just really never got in to the characters and I felt the book jumped all over the place. Also, thought the relationship w/the young man Nazneen meets would be more exciting or refreshing -- a total let down.I didn't care about the characters at all and felt overwhelmed by all of the ""letters"" regarding Hasina, Nazneen's sister.Really didn't enjoy it at all."
2,Falls flat in it's won verbosity,"Since most of the reviewers have already shared the storyline of this novel, I will spare the reader any more- much as I wish Monica Ali had done. The novel is 300 pages too long...Read Jhumpa Lahiri instead."
1,This book stinks,"I read this for a literature course. Had I not been required to read it, I would have stopped long before page three-hundred whatever.Personally, I found it too long for the low quality detail and plot Monica Ali gives us."
3,Ok book,This book is ok but it didn't wrap me up like some books do. I really had to slog through it. It is about a Bangladesh womans adjustment of moving from childhood in Bangladesh to being a married wife in England. Very good book about an imigrant trying to adapt to a new lifestyle.
5,Brilliant!,Monica Ali pulls off something amazing with this novel. It was amazing how she intertwined the theme of fate with seemingly unlikely events that occur in Nazneen's life. Truly engaging--give it a shot.
2,Monica Ali's Brick Lane,"I usually enjoying reading novels pertaining to other cultures, especially Asian cultures. However, I found this book rather dry. I constantly found myself re-reading because of the complex, upon complex sentences. At one point, I almost didn't want to finish the book because it wasn't one of those books that you want to run home and read."
2,Difficult to Finish,"I have a problem with abandoning a book before finishing it because I can't give up the hope that there may be something worthwhile at the end. If I were the type to cast an unfinished book aside, I would have done so with Brick Lane. There came a point in the novel when the main character, Nazneen, began attending political meetings, which is perfectly interesting in itself, but the story gets bogged down in the political details and becomes boring. I found myself disliking Nazneen's choices at the end of the book. I also didn't like Nazneen's children. While characters in novels are almost always flawed, these flaws are supposed to endear us to the character. These characters just didn't seem to have enough redeeming qualities to be likeable. The one character I found that I liked was Nazneen's husband, Chanu, who irritated Nazneen, but I couldn't help seeing how good of a person he really was."
2,Where's the connection??,"This read was a huge disappointment. There were so many opportunities to draw the reader in, yet the author failed to make the catch. Developing a feel for these characters was difficult at best. As emotional events unfolded in the life of Nazneem, the author failed to take the extra step of connecting with the reader. At one point a significant loss occurs, yet the emotional aspects of such a tremendous loss are completely neglected."
3,Too discursive and misintegrated.,"This is a book with a lot of interesting details, but unfortunately is little more than colourful bric-a-brac lacking sufficient contextual integration to make the narrative an engaging read.Ali's prose style is effective and tidy, and she addresses an important issue about what the point of education is beyond collecting certificates and degrees with respect to Chanu, who becomes embittered because his intellect has such little value. This is a major concern with all ethnic minorities that regard education - in broad terms- as a ticket to better living.This book is okay, but does not merit the publishers overly indulgent hype."
4,Good Read,"Monica Ali's debut novel is a good, but not great read. Normally I devour novels such as these that have roots in Eastern culture, but this story although it opened well seemed to drag along in the middle section of the book. To me it seemed as if the story was drawn out in order to fill pages. The essence of the story, for me at least, was lost in the middle part of the novel. Fortunately the thread of the novel was found again in a triumphant conclusion."
2,Book Club gives thumbs down.,"We chose this book for our Book Club, and the overwhelming response was negative. The common thread was that the letters in the book actually distracted from the story, were difficult to read (poor language flow), and in general did not enlarge the understanding of the characters. In addition, the characters in the book did not engage and in some cases, actually enraged, the readers."
4,How it feels to be a Muslim woman in the big world,"A peek at a Bangaladeshi female immigrant's experience in the big wide world of London is what Ali provides us readers in Brick Lane. Raised as the docile and obedient daughter, Nazneen accepts an arranged marriage to an old man who takes her from Bangladesh to a Bangladeshi community in London. There, for the first time, she comes in contact with (or at least observes) the freedoms of Western women in The Land of Opportunity. Within the tight Bangaladeshi community, author Ali gives us all degrees of the immigrant experience through Nazneen's eyes. This unsparing look into a world of suppression that few of us can imagine is very gracefully rendered."
4,"I loved it, too.","Add my voice to the chorus of praise for Monica Ali's Brick Lane. I especially enjoyed the way she stayed focused on Nazneen's life, but also deftly expanded the story -- through time, with memories of her family; and through space, with letters from her sister in Bangladesh.The parting of Nazneen and her hapless husband was done very well: her genuine affection for Chanu and his acknowledgement of his own failure were shown with great delicacy, in very moving language."
2,False Advertising,"This T-Shirt was supposedly ""licensed"" by DC and Warner Brothers but it's really just the regular design printed on a standard T-Shirt Brand, Delta Heavy Weight to be exact... kind of like false advertising since the picture they display is a completely different T-shirt than the one you receive. The one in the picture is of much higher quality than the one they supply, I know because I owned the one in the picture with the official tag, which, the one I ordered did not have."
2,a little disappointed,"I thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope, it wasn't, it was pretty limp. For the price I suppose i got what I paid for."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I was not pleased with this product. The rope isn't heavy enough to swing easily, it gets tangled very easily."
1,worst jump rope EVER!,Rope is too light for any reasonable jump roping. You have to REALLY slow down the swing to give the rope chance to catch up. Went straight for trash.
3,"2 Grandes conjunto Primavera, Los Rielero's","The CD 2 Grandes is too bouncy for my taste.... excellent vocals but I was looking for something romantic and passionate... not jumpy... but what it is is excellent... Jennifer, Baja California"
1,Bottomless Money Pit,"The defender catches a few mosquitoes when it works. I'm a long-time owner and unfortunately, the thing works for one season at a time AT BEST. The ""head"" goes out and you have to have it ""serviced"" (meaning they send you a replacement and you send back the old one) for 1/3 to 1/2 the purchase price. $300 price tag, + monthly costs of $40 to $60 would be worth it -- if it worked better -- and more importantly, stayed running.Truly, the most frustrating product of any kind I have ever owned. Period.American Biophysics must know about the problems, but continues to put out a faulty product. Hello, blood-sucking, greedy class action lawyers? Time to file a class action suit! Don't waste your money. Buy a trombone type or pump-up sprayer and douse the yard with garlic pepper tea (get the recipe at dirtdoctor dot com."
1,Failed to catch'em,"Our unit is going back. No problems setting it up or getting it going. However, it wasn't catching mosquitos. They would congregate in the air around it (no suprise considering how thick they are in our yard), but the trap has insufficient suction to draw them in."
4,"""Kills Them All""","I have to say that the Mosquito Magnet- Defender is one of the best products I have found. Within three days the trap was completely full of mosquitoes and ""no see-ums"". I also recommend the use of the attractants made specifically for the ""Magnet"". One attractant came with the unit and others can be purchased separately. It is also very easy to use; just empty the trap when it starts to get full and there are no sticky glue pads to mess with. The Mosquito Magnet has allowed my family to once again enjoy our yard and our pool even after the sun goes down! I definetly recommend the Mosquito Magnet Defender to anyone with who has a problem with gnats, no see-ums, or mosquitoes. The only draw back is that there are no guages to let you know when the propane is almost empty. This is only a problem because I believe the igniter will continue trying to ignite with nothing to burn; thus, shortening the igniter life."
1,Don't buy this rip off,"I ran it for three summers total - bought expensive tanks of propane (about 3 per summer) and the replacement attractants... to catch a grand total of 10 mosquitos.A rolled up newspaper is cheaper, as is going inside."
1,Tragedy........,I think it is a real tragedy that this company is still allowed to peddle this piece of junk.
1,1.5 tanks of propane and it's dead,It worked for 1.5 tanks of propane. It never started again. At least the Coleman worked for 1 season. I'd give that one 2 stars!
1,Listen to the bad reviews don't buy,I bought this last year and it did work fine but as so many have said tried to start it this year and yo and behold fault light comes on. 4 quick clean cartriges and no help from customer service do not waste your money
1,Works real good when it works,"In the 1st year they replaced my unit after 6 months, that unit worked 2 years with no problems. I get into my 2nd tank of gas this year and the unit craps out. I did all the tricks with no results, this ones a goner.A device that costs this much should last at least 5 years.Forget the class action, the lawyers get a big payday and we get a coupon for a free box of Octenol, yea right.I realize that this is not a repair thread but I feel the need to pass this on:I had a code on my unit that said the unit was not getting enough gas (slow blinking red). I read on another site where one guy attached a shop vac to the horn and got his unit to work. I did the same with my sears shop vac, pushed it into the horn area (without the bait in and where the octenol is) and turned the shop vac on for a few minutes. My machine now works. I would recommend doing this with a large vac due the large vacuum you get. Better than spending $200 for a repair person."
1,Short term success,"I've had my mosquito magnet defender for 3 years. It worked exceptionally well for most of the first season, killing a lot of mosquito and tiny black flies that are a nuisance. It stopped working after about 4 or 5 refills of propane. I then sent it back to the factory for service where I was charged over $100 to get it running again. It lasted for about a month and died again. I sent it back with a nasty gram expressing my displeasure. It was repaired at no additional charge and returned but not until the mosquito season was over. I started it up again this spring only to have it stop operation after the first tank of propane. I've given up. I do not want to loose another season while these guys fiddle around with the unit so I'm probably going to try the mega-catch brand next. The reviews are much better."
2,This devise is faulty,After a couple of tanks of propnae the trap would not ignite. Tried using two quick clear CO2 cartridges which did not do anything at all.
1,Run Away from this $400 Paper Weight,"We bought the Mosquito Magnet two years ago. It has never worked! Only thing I get is the fault light. For two seasons I tried everything the company told me (CO2, New Bottle, different techniques to open bottle valve) and nothing. We pressed, all the company would offer is for me to take it to one of their repair sites at my expense! They never admitted I got a lemon. I just purchased the Blue Rhino Skeeter-Vac. Awesome! Works from right out of the box and has not stopped for 1 month. I took my Mosquito Magnet to the landfill last week."
1,piece of junk,"Worked for approximately 2 weeks, then quit. Have tried every trouble-shooting step in the manual to no avail. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The Mosquito Magnet, even the ""pro"" really, really expensive models, work maybe for a year and then quit. Then, if you're silly like we were, you send them even more money, and then they quit working after a year. Don't waste your money!"
2,Good while it lasts (which isn't very long),"Like other posters here, I have had ongoing problems with my mosquito magnet. First year - worked great, second year - wouldn't start, had to purchase an expensive maintenance kit, then it worked for the rest of the summer, third year - dead again.Unless they have greatly improved their quality or their warranty, I wouldn't purchase it."
4,"So far, great!","I live next to conservation land, and my Mosquito Magnet has caught 1/2 of it's basket full of mosquitos in less that one 21 day cycle. Mosquitos hover around it all the time.The only downside is that it was hard to get running the first time. It may require level ground (my first try was at a slight slant), and I had problems with getting it to feed from my propane tank."
1,Waste of Money,"I tried both Mosquito Magnet and the Colman version.We have thousands of mosquito's around our property. Both magnets were rotated around the acre in all the hot spots.Not one mosquito caught.We made sure to follow the instructions Exactly. We replaced the machine and did everything the manufacturer said.We returned both.Total waste of money.The best way is to use the 5 gallon bucket with boron and W/D40.I am looking for the exact mix online.Its free and it is said to work better than all other products together.When you return your Magner, find the mix for the bucket and watch it work."
5,Defender works great,"My Defender just died after 6 years of catching 100's of thousands of mosquitos. I had a problem with it when I first purchased it (wouldn't stay turned on) and the company sent me a replacement. Not a single problem since then until now. After 6 years it owes me nothing. I'm going to replace it with a 1 acre Patriot and see how that goes.If yours turns on, and the light goes solid red, and you're not catching anything, I suspect user error. You're either using the wrong attractant or not placing it properly."
3,Good While it Last,"Purchased first Mosquito Magnet around 2000. I have owned the Liberty and Defender( 5 total). Both caught many mosquitoes and did not catch a lot of other insect types. The technology is good but reliability is poor.The last one I purchased was reconditioned and would not restat after the first propane tank was used. Closest service to Texas was Rhode Island. Restarting was a problem with every one I owned.Rather expensive when you consider initial cost, plus replacing propane tankand attractant every three weeks. Also, requires blow-out with CO2 with every tank change.I'm ready to try another brand/type."
2,Mosuito Magnet Defender,"Very disappointed. The amount paid is not worth it. You have to get a new tank about every 2 weeks and we are still getting ""eaten up"" every time we are outside."
5,Helps with other bitting bugs as well,"I live on the Gulf coast and while the mosquitos are enough to keep you from spending much time outside, the yellow flies will make you refuse to leave the house at all. Everyday I would get at least 3 bites walking from my house to my car 20 feet away. After 2 days with the defender running, there was about 50 yellow flies and over 100 mosquitos in the net. It's been about 3 weeks now, and I'll come across 1 or 2 bitting bugs a day, and that's only if I spend half the day outside. We have lived here for about 5 years and this is the first time we have been able to get any use out of our yard. Last month I couldn't even cut the grass or hang laundry in shorts! I have read a bunch of reviews on here that say the defender only lasts 1 or 2 seasons, and if that turns out to be the case, I still think it's well worth the $300 every 1 or 2 years to be able to have full use of my yard!"
1,Do not buy this overpriced lawn ornament,"I bought three units for my three acre yard. Total, I caught about 100 mosquitos. All three units stopped working after only one season.This is quite possibly the biggest scam evAr. I honestly do not understand how this company can stay in business.Save your money. Keep your yard cut short, and empty any standing water."
1,Worked for 2 months,This product did attract the mosquitos it caught hundreds.On its third month it stopped working.It will not start we used up 6 co2 silver clearance things. We have tried 3 differant propane tanks. One is a totally new one and had it purged as they say.I have fiddled and worked trying to get it started for a month now with no joy.Sadly I have to say its just poorly made product and I cannot recomend it.
1,biggest ripoff I ever encountered,"The mosquito magnet does not work in Arlington, Texas. They sent me a different atracterant and it did not work either. This is the biggest money waste I have encountered. We cannot use our yard because of mosquitoes and this expensive damn thing did not do any good at all. Please don't waste your money on the Mosquito Magnet. It does not work!!!!!"
3,Cheap components,"I live in the south with the Asian Tiger skeeters and when I first set up the machine I didn't use the included attract that doesn't work with the Tigers. I just ran the propane for a day and and didn't catch anything. I bought Lurex and caught several hundred after a week. So am I just wasting money on the propane? After the first tank emptied, I replaced it and the plastic part that screws onto the tank broke in two while installing."
1,What a piece of junk!,"Yes the ""Defender"" got great reviews-if you live on the east coast.This piece of junk didn't catch a single mosquito during a 2 month period. Yeah watched the video, moved the unit with wind changes, experimented with attractant. Changed the propane 2x, blew out the orrifice.Only wish I could return this waste of money.Check with your local health dept first before buying!"
1,Didn't work for us,"After moving the East Coast and having ourselfs and our children look like we had some type of virus from all of the mosquito bites we got. We went on the scout...we used the skin so soft, the smelly skin sprays, we thought it was time to invest in this expensive product. After finding out this was the best Mosquito Magnet on the market we bought it. It ran for 3 days and we caught one mosquito and a pincher bug. We returned it and spent the money on 15 Mosquito Lanterns and more spray. It seems to be working out better than the mosquito magnet, and it is cheaper too! I gave it one star for the one mosquito we caught, after all it is a great idea if it worked."
1,Worked only 1 year,"Set up in the back yard last July. Worked great...caught net fulls of mosquitos. Stored it as they recommended for the winter.Took it out a week ago. Used new cartridge, net and propane tank..NOTHINGTalked to customer support and got no where. Re-cleaned the unit, another propane tank - another cylinder. Still nothing. Its JUNK!"
1,BUYER BEWARE !,"Mosquito Magnet products do not last. Through warranty replacement and upgrades, I have owned four units over five years. None have lasted through the second season. The last unit (which is MY LAST UNIT) worked less than 60 days. Support is poor and quality is nil. The mosquitos caught cost me several dollars each."
1,Unreliable and Bad Service,"I purchased two Mosquito Magnet Defenders last Summer and never could get one of them to work. Called the service number and was given the run around (different stories about what the problem was) for about a week and finally told that it must be that the propane tank needed ""purging"". Had the tank purged -- didn't work. Bought a new tank -- didn't work. Swapped tanks with the one that did work -- didn't work. Piece of garbage with bad service. The one that works does great. But pretty expensive when you have to buy two for one working model. And frustrating when the company won't stand by it's product."
1,Only works for one season,"I bought three of these Mosquito Magnet units. They worked well for a few months then no longer worked by the end of the season. Three units, without even one working, says to me that this is a defective design. I tried to clean them with the compressed CO2 cartridges this week, in preparation for a new season, and all I get is the ""fault"" light. Don't buy.P.S. I have never written a review about any product but I feel cheated by this one."
1,The 18 month wonder,"The first time I tried to clear the unit I had a l-shaped adapter. Damn thing blew apart. Low and behold, they had a different design, now. The unit worked ok for abot a year and one-half, then I started getting the famous error light flashing. I cleared it four times w/co2, got a new tank of popane, reset the regulator. The whole nine yards, but nothing worked. When I called tech support, all they could say was that it was an internal problem and to send it back at my cost and they would send me another at $130 = 19.95 shipping again. Then I said that's not bad for a new unit, to which she replied that it was refurbished. I asked why the could not send me the internal parts. Can't do it. Hey, what a deal. I passed on this golden opportunity. Maybe someone else makes amore reliable unit that does the same function."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother. I've had mine for two summers. The first summer (when it actually worked), the effect was minimal. The second summer, it never would start up. I tried everything in the manual and online. Forget about real tech support or warranty work.This is simply not a device worth your time or money."
1,Returned ours,"We tried the defender model, for 3 weeks. Mosquitos sat on the device and were not drawn in. We wonder if it has enough suction power. Support line is busy and a long wait. About 25-50 were trapped in 3 weeks. We want it to work, may try another. Just check the retailer return policy."
2,bad customer service,Biophysics got bought out by Woodstream. Customer service is now about as bad as you can get. Trying to get a replacement part for a part they recalled. However their customer service keeps promising the part is going to be send and then keeps delaying delivery. Before long the summer will be over and I will not need a mosquito magnet.
5,Works for Me,I've used this product for several years and have had great luck. The trick is to get it going early in the season and keep it going as per the instructions. The reduction in mosquitos is evident and much safer than using sprays. I have three Magnets serving a larger parcel of land with wetlands and they serve their purpose well.
1,It doesn't work,"Sadly, all the great literature and compelling information provided by the Mosquito Magnet company (American Biophysics) just isn't true. I think we caught about 2 or 3 mosquitoes, and those poor suckers just ended up in the bag by sheer bad luck. We're not the only ones - other people in my neighborhood similarly suckered in by the great literature that American Biophysics presents say they don't work for them either. The company put us on a beta test using special octenal for our type of mosquitos: Asian but still...nothing... we've given up and are going to toss the thing - I'd feel guilty selling it or even giving it away. Buy skin repellant and install a screened porch on your house instead."
1,Still itching,"Where to begin? It was so exciting to think there was actually a way to eliminate mosquitoes from my backyard. Instead, the only bugs killed where the ones I slapped off my legs as I spent several hours over the course of a couple of weeks hauling this thing to different points of my yard and begging it to actually run. What really tries your patience is that it takes 20 minutes to warm up and five minutes to shut down. Do the math and you can try to start it only twice per hour. As the father of a 3-year old (one of the reasons why I bought this white elephant), I don't have six hours in a row to coax this tempermental thing to work. The instruction manual isn't much help -- it doesn't even tell you what the different speeds of flashing light mean. After flushing it several times with CO2 cartridges (at $6.50 a pop) and calling customer service, I'm ready to send it back. My advice: Don't waste your money."
3,Just a problem,"Hi,i purchase this item. Price very good.I received it very fast. ThanksJust a small problem, this item is for US country and it doesn't work in Europe.I have to find another propane valve and fix it...Maybe you should have to tell me that before sending it to me.Greetings"
1,Terrible Product,"Very poor quality. Broken more often than it worked. At service center multiple times. When it was home, spent many dollars and more hours maintaining. Service center will have you standing on your head, whistling Dixie, and using your next pay check on CO2 cartridges to try to get it cleared. My advice to you...stay clear."
5,Works for me...,"I've had the Defender model for 4 years now and it has performed as advertized. I live in the Deep South and have it located on a covered deck next to an entry door; it makes a big dent in the number of the biting insects (not just mosquitoes) that get into the house and loiter around the deck area. I did have a warranty adjustment right out of the box with the first unit but the factory sent a replacement quickly and I've had solid performance from this unit since. The unit is A/C powered but restarts by itself in the event of a power interruption. I wouldn't expect these products to completely eliminate biting insects from a given area but they do suppress their numbers effectively, in the 90 percentile range, and are worth the investment."
1,Only lasts one season,I bought one and it lasted one season. I bought a new one and it lasted one season. No service centers in my area. Great when they work but that isn't long...
1,Don't Bother,"In theory this device should work. In practice it just doesn't. Gave it a very patient 3 year trial. Just does't take out enough mosquitos to make any difference. Another big problem with these types of devices is placement. Its hard to find good placement given the yard and power cord limitations. To work you need to change placement every time the wind direction changes, not very practical."
1,Works Great! (But Only for the First Season),"The unit caught a lot of mosquitoes last year and I was quite pleased with it.I had read some negative reviews of the product but I attributed the reported problems to not maintaining the Defender properly. I made it a point to perform a CO2 purge on every tank change, not to use swapped tanks (Blue Rhino) and bring the unit inside for winter and clean it.This was all no avail. The unit will not start and the MM solution is to purchase a refurbished unit. There has been a lot of grumbling on various websites about a class action suit and trust me, I will be the first in line."
1,Can't Wait For The Class-Action Lawsuit to Get my Money Back,"Total junk! Altogether, the MM caught one sandwich baggy of mosquitos in the first 3-4 months or so, then quit working...If it would have kept working like it did for the 1st few months, would be a good product (EXPENSIVE to operate!)...Notice the higher ratings come from people who've only had it a month or so......Do yourself a favor - re-sort these ratings from Lowest to Highest, then read and heed the Lowest Ratings - they tell the truth...IOW, DO NOT BUY THE MM!! (unless you have $$ to throw away)I'll bet that as Amazon sends previously-happy MM owners email recommending the MM (like they just did w/me), those same (now-disgruntled) MM owners will be reminded of their POS MM and jump at the chance to tell the truth...At the end of the day, the best thing about the MM is that with only 3 pieces, it offers quick disassembly for easy disposal in the nearest dumpster!"
2,Two years.,"If you can get two years out of this you are one of the lucky ones.At half the price it would not be as bad, I'd give it a extra star. When it worked it did what it was advertised to do."
2,The 3-Year Itch,"I figure after you read about 200 reviews like this you might get the message and think twice about buying this machine. Hey listen, the MM worked GREAT for 3 years, which is why I gave it 2 stars; but then it got the Red Blinking Light of Death and refused to start no matter which of the recommended fixes I tried, so now I'm just trying to figure out how to dispose of it. There's a review somewhere earlier from a guy who just buys one every couple of years...that's probably the right attitude, but I can't really afford it.If you still choose to buy one, good luck."
2,The good the bad,"The Good; This product does exactly what it claims. It kills tons of mosquitoes. If you get it going soon enough in the season, you may be able to make a dent in the mosquito population. At least thats the theory.The bad; This product only works for a season then it requires maintainance. Its well built but poorly engineered. To that end, I can not recommend this product. You must go up a model at least because this model has only 1 diagnostic code which essentially means 'something is wrong.' The higher models have multiple codes to tell you exactly what part is acting up. You WILL be fixing this thing so your going to need the diagnostics.On the bright side, the thing does not actually break. It just needs deep cleaining of all of its parts. So at the beginning of each season you have to completely disassemble it and clean each and every mechanical part. If you think you can either do that, or are willing to pay for it to be done, then go ahead and purchase... the next model up."
2,Save your money,"I have just read a few reviews on this product and am shocked to find everyone else having the same issue I had. This unit worked very well the first year and this spring when I brought it out of storage I couldn't get it to run. I followed directions, cleared the unit with not one but all three of the CO2 cartridges. Nothing but pure disappointment. If someone offers an extended warranty on this item buy it and get a new unit every year otherwise find something else."
1,Great Expectations...,"I was hoping this would be the ideal soother for my son's room, but the thing made a grinding mechanical noise once I put the batteries in.I returned it the next day.I would not recommend this product, nor would I purchase anything from this company again.The toy appears to be cheaply made, and the grinding mechanical noise told me that they probably used sub standard parts, I began to worry that this thing might even catch fire if I kept it in my house."
3,it's a coloring book,"i suppose i should have figured it out from the title, but it is in fact a coloring book. it's not, what i thought, a book of colorful mucha figures. get some crayons, or paint or whatever, and have at it."
3,"Slow paced, but worthwhile","The tale of two brothers, one average and one a math genius, make this low budget indie come alive, even if the payoff is minimal at best. What's William Hurt doing here? He's not bad, but I thought he would be in bigger films. The whole thing is a little offbeat, of course, and that's why it's worth watching. Not many films are set in as bland a place as Ohio."
4,Beautiful film!,I thought it was a lyrical and thoughtful piece... Don't know why some reviewers had such strong reactions against it...
2,Amateur Direction!,"While this film had a decent plot, there is a reason it has been so-unnoticed. The direction doesn't make you curious, the script doesn't flow, the characters are annoying and the film seems to be going on on it's own without creating any questions or being relevant to the viewer. There is a character who's a math genius yet his character was very incongruous and it seems like the director is having a tough time portraying him. Another young girl who loves to break hearts was also a little twisted. This is a bit like that Christina Ricci picture where she tries to induce someone younger than her to have sex with her, only that somehow that film was more relevant.Can't help but be cynical as ever. Do yourself a favour, close this window and do not watch this film. Want to watch a similar much better film? The Squid and the whale. But I'm sure most fans have of this fickle genre have seen that film. Cheerio."
2,Belongs in seedy times square theater,I had hoped America had stopped making these degrading pornographic movies. In this movie we see depraved acts. I would not recommend this film except to an abnormal psychology class.
3,BRITISH ENGLISH - CASTILIAN (SPAIN) SPANISH,"In regards to pronunciation confusion on page 5, one must remember that these are according to BRITISH pronunciations, and therefore 'pot' IS the correct pronunciation, and so on. One can look past this and learn useful vocabulary and phraseology, although it must be noted that it is teaching Spanish spoken in Spain. It is by no means the best cassette-and-book series, but for the price (less than $.....) it's quite a deal and a provides a solid base for the amateur language enthusiast. After all, if you want to master a language, enroll in classes...I would even use this book to teach my adult conversation class. De todos modos, es un buen libro."
3,"Good, but slightly hard to follow",This is a fairly goood book for beginers. It is hard to follow though. Especialy in the end when it gets kind of confusing.
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent book... After reading three other Struts book, this book has several examples that really broke Struts down to where I could easily understand."
4,elegant MVC instantiation,"The basic motivator is the use of Model - View - Controller as the design basis for a servlet and JSP project. Struts is an instantiation of MVC. The book shows how you can take it and develop a fully fledged servlet package. Elegant formulation.To be sure, the code examples are sometimes verbose. But that is just a fact of life. Keep a focus on the underlying principles.The book is not just confined to Struts. Related issues, like using Tiles Framework for factoring out a consistent presentation of web pages, are explained, showing how they interoperate with Struts."
5,Great tutorial for a beginner.. and a professional,"I've used the book to teach struts to my development team. As a Software Factory Company we need the fastest response from our employees even those don't know struts. Is easy to understand struts if you use this book from beginning to end. The JSTL chapter is a great aid and also the persistence chapter. If you want to learn struts get this book, then to refine your skills, buy the one with de horse in the cover."
2,Check other books before buying this one,"I've ordered this book 1 month ago. After a first reading, my opinion was that presented ideas were obscur...Now I'm doing a 2nd pass to summarize it and, to be concise, this book is not a good book ! There are a lot of errors and it is not well structured. I haven't read an other book about Struts ( explanations for the 2 stars in place of 1 ), but I've ordered some Head First books about Servlets, Jsp, Ejb and trust me: I was completely tangled about some concepts after this Struts read.2 solutions: Head First books are written by some superhuman or this guy is really not a good writter with clear ideas. Give a try to other books."
2,very weird.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.WR: Mysteries of the Organism made in Yugoslavia as W.R. - Misterije organizma is documentary film about sex and how it relates to the Austrian psychaiatrist Wilhelm Reich whose initials are the basis for the film's title.The film is a mixture of Soviet bloc politics and sex. It contains dialogue in both Serbocroatian and English and was filmed in Europe and America.The special features are interviews with the film's director Dusan Makavejev, Makavejev's autobiographical film, Hole in the Soul, and audio commentary.The film has graphic sexual content and is inappropriate for minors"
3,Oh Well...,"If your experience is like mine, YOU will find this a source of many minutes of fun with your cat.Your cat will be bored to tears, and possibly terrified by it, but you will keep casting away, cajoling and convincing your cat that: gee, this is really fun, and: look there, kitty! See!? It's a mouse!And so on.Do get this to entertain yourself whilst your cat looks on in bemusement at the stupid, easily-entertained human..."
4,A story that needed to be told...,"Interesting book about Dickey Chapelle. She wanted to be a pilot, but became a photojournalist--the first woman photographer to get accredation to cover the war in the Pacific in World War II. After that, she was present at nearly every noteworthy conflict or event there was--if something was going on, Dickey wanted to be there, and usually got her way. She worked for Life, Reader's Digest, National Geographic, and many other magazines and papers. She was killed in 1965, while with the Marines in Vietnam.Her personal life was not always smooth sailing, and I find it incredible that she achieved all she did.What I found most interesting about Dickey was her spirit--she didn't let conventions or anybody stand in her way. She was a trailblazer in her field, and I'm glad that Roberta Ostroff wrote this book--Dickey certainly deserves recognition for her courage and and heroism."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"The book is very factual and an easy read because the author is a journalist herself. However Ms. Ostroff tends to engage in some hero worship with her subject, which came as something of a disappointment to me. Overall not a bad book but not one I'm keeping on my shelf."
3,Good but flawed,"After plouging through this book I came to appreciate her writing style but this book has many historical mistakes. The conclusions she draws are based on very thin ice indeed, few of them based on fact. But the biggest disappointment to me was with all the time she spent interviewing Speer she hardly touched on the work he actually did. This is a real pity and a missed opportunity as he is now dead. Speer was famous for turning around the German wartime economy/production, his actions probably lengthened the war between one or two years. Sereny hardly touched on how he did this, about one or two pages out of 700 odd.Instead we get 600 pages of her whining about the jews and did he know or didn't he, well of course he did, so what?"
5,excellent biography of former nazi,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Third Reich. Contains exhaustive interviews with speer, former nazis, etc. Gives a good idea of Speer's thoughts, motives, etc. at various stages of his career and imprisonment."
2,Disappointing,"This is not what I expected it to be. Aslett may be the guru of clean, but time management is not his forte. You have to be Type A, obsessive-compulsive to go along with his strategies. I feel sorry for his wife!"
3,Some usefulness but wordy,"I can appreciate some of Mr. Aslett comments and suggestions but I found the book ""wordy"" and vague. It might have been a better book if he'd have played it a little straighter with the reader. I found myself wondering once or twice while I read it if I couldn't save part of my ""48 hour day"" by not reading this book. There are some useful insights in the book however (I think his points on having direction are worth considering); so, for me, a ""fair"" rating is about right."
5,Great story,This is a very moving personal story of what made the person many of us grew up watching. I believed I knew him but this book took my perception to another level entirely.
2,White border fence,I was rather disappointed. I thought they were wood. They are supposed to connect but I can't get them to come together in the right place to connect and they are hard to pound into the ground. I was even more disappointed when a couple of weeks later I found a roll of wire border at a garage sale which would have worked even better and it was only $1.00. I would have considered returning them but I already have them in the ground as best as I can.
5,The essence of authentic reggae,"How many people know that the first man to make reggae popular was not Bob Marley, but Jimmy Cliff?This album showcases his 1960's hits, including the hope-filled song of brotherhood (and sisterhood), WONDERFUL WORLD BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, the beautiful MANY RIVERS TO CROSS, VIETNAM billed by Bob Dylan as the best protest song ever) , the inspirational You Can Get It If You Really Want ,the determined HARD ROAD TO TRAVEL, the African drumbeats of BONGO MAN (A COME),the wise TIME WILL TELL, the plaintive SUFFERIN' (IN THE LAND), and the upbeat COME INTO MY LIFE.You have got to listen to Jimmy Cliff, for the essence of authentic reggae."
2,Just so-so,"The book does have some insights into human anatomy, however it is all bland with no feel for it.Most importantly it concentrates more into male anatomy and not give you a healthy dose of the female anatomy as well.As a male artist, studying my own body will be more educational than this book."
2,not bad,"I'm changing my vote to 4 because I was a bit harsh on critiquing this book. I went through the book again and I found that the book does suit beginner anatomy really well. As another reviewer, I was turned off by the art but nonetheless it is a decent book on the subject and I recommended it to beginners and others alike.If your looking for other good figure drawing/anatomy books, pick jack Hamm's book ""Drawing the head & figure"" or Andrew Loomis' ""figure drawing for all it's worth""."
3,"Well, not AMAZINGLY easy......","Like someone said before me, the problem with this book is that Hart never really fully explains to you, Okay, if this is in front of you, this is how you draw it step by step. Instead he disects the body parts and shows you his underdrawing and his finished drawing and says, that is how it looks. Which is isn't the worst way ever, but for a begining illustrator, he has skipped the steps on HOW to get there, which is the most important part. Also, this isn't the book to get if your going for photo realism. Many of his models reflect his work in the comic book industry and the faces definetly show it. The book isn't bad by any means and people can learn a lot from it (and the price is definetly right), but I wish he would have dived more in depth and shown us step by step how to draw from life. If your expecting that, look elsewhere."
2,Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy.,"I was somwhat dissapointed in the artwork in this book.I guess I expected more from the artist. The instruction in this book is rather simple and straight forward,I did like that. However there was something lacking in the over all quality. This book is probably alright for the artist just picking up thier pencils for the first time."
1,A bellow average anatomy book,"I have no idea why I bot this book. I thought it was going to be a good anatomy book at the least. Basically it's very cartoony, think Titan A.E. This person can't draw so well either, A normal Figure drawer is better. He seams to draw some people too stubby on the legs and the crotch area too low on women. He can't draw manga style either, he draws them to cheap or to stiff. The artist needs to go back to school and do some studies on human anatomy. It also looks like he needs some art lessons too. I would have given this book 2 stars and a half but I decided to round down. Basically as a figure drawer I would be embarrassed to draw like this person, I think he should study lighting, photography, Animation(So his characters wont be so stiff), and figure drawing. Basically if you want a real anatomy book I suggest you buy ""Dynamic Anatomy"" by Burne Hogarth and don't make the mistake like I did on buying this book."
4,A good basic reference and starting point,"This book is a very good exposition of human anatomy for the artist. It includes sections on skeletal structure, musculature, flexation, and how various poses are affect the illustrating of a human figure. This is not a book on how to draw a likeness of someone in particular but a good study on the human body and a foundation of it's structure and illustration. If you are looking to draw a likeness then it is still valuable as a basic understanding of anatomy but there are better choices.The book is a good buy for those who are interested in learning underlying anatomy in order to create accurate and detailed illustrations. It is a good buy and I'm sure will be a regular reference for me."
2,Way to simple,"The problem with this book is that you don't really learn anything about drawing anatomy. He just says 'This is what this looks like or 'This is looks like that w/o giving any real tips. Like all of Hart's books he just makes you ""think"" that you've learned something."
2,Just ok,"I found this book to be rather disappointing. It focuses on comic book style illustration which isn't bad in itself, but the book teaches almost nothing usefull about propotions, muscles, the skeletal struture, or how these affect what you draw.If your looking for an anatomy book along the same lines as this one(comic book style), I would recommend ""How To Draw Manga: Bodies and Anatomy""."
5,This book is a beginner's best friend.,"While I am sure that this book isn't the equivalent of years or artistic training, I recognize that it's not supposed to be. This book is amazing. Before I bought this book I had never drawn in my life and the first thing I drew using this book, a man's face turned out actually looking like a mans face! I had expected to be frustrated with the stick figure I would inevitably draw, but it was actually a good picture. Now as I get further and further into the book I can see my skills and understanding of the body improving dramatically. If you are looking to draw GET THIS BOOK. If you are an experienced artist of twenty years this book may not be neccessary, but I would take a look at it anyway espeicially if you are a teacher.Once more, GET THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Bad drawing,"The trouble in finding a good ""tips"" book on anatomy is that they are so inexpertly drawn, and Christopher Hart's book falls in that category. It has a few tips, but the drawings are linear with no volume or texture. The worst is that the origins of the muscles are never right because the artwork isn't substantial enough. I agree with the first reviewer. I,too, was robbed of my money. The man can't draw!To have a first rate anatomy book, I recommend Loise Gordon's 'How to Draw the Human Figure: An Anatomical Approach' which delivers everything that Hart promized but failed to do. Gordon's drawings are simply the best in the field. Get the other two books by her, and your'e set to study anatomy seriously. In addition I find the book 'Artistic Anatomy,' by Dr. Paul Richer, a good reference manual."
2,its informative but just ok,"this book isnt the worst but it isnt the best either, when i bought it i was just looking for a good anatomy book because i im a aspiring comic book artist at age 15 and i needed to understand the anatomy of the body.this book mainly assisted me on small simple things but it just didnt get into any depth or major detail so there were things incomplete in this book. if your a beginner this might be ok to start off with since its just simple.Or if your like me and you want to learn the anatomy full throttle than dont get this book get something more detailed. so two stars because its just ok the art is alright and the info is pretty informative (you can learn a little from this book) but id say get something with more detail for a better and more convincing understanding also more convincing artwork (oh and im a boy dont mind the name at the top)"
2,beginners guide,"this book is not helpful to anyone who is a serious artist. if you want to get good at drawing, want to learn more about anatomy, get an anatomy book. this book is suited for people who don't really care about anatomy, and just want to know enough to scrape by.I did not like this book."
2,I'm surprised at how good the reviews are...,"I love Chris Hart. And in a lot of his newer books he's much better than his old 2004 books. And since I love Chris' stuff, my mom bought me this or Christmas. And I've got to say this book is absolutely terrible. The first section was on the human face and it was really bad. The book didn't even properly focus on female anatomy, in fact it didn't at all, other than som random half nudes in weird positions. I suppose it's alright for details like male muscles and such, but I was looking for basic anatomy. I really would rather have his 'Figure It Out!' book because I need to know how to pose my characters, etc. I'm not a beginner, and I'm no professional, but my skill set is higher than the content of this book.I would recommend this as an accompaniment to another anatomy book for details, but you should not buy this for any other reason. I don't think it would help beginners or the advanced."
4,Helpful but...,"This book is wonderful for getting a good grip on the understanding of anatomy basics. My only criticism is that in some places the drawings were a little off - like a hand that looked like it was being bent backwards but was drawn like it was coming forward. But on the whole, the book was instructive."
5,What a wonderful learning Experience,"I've taking drawing classes for while now, but this book was the most helpful and advanced me more then any other teacher or class. I enormously enjoy the figure drawing more then I ever did using the tips and techniques that Hart provides in his book. Thanks Mr. Hart, you make my drawing a wonderful experience that brings me great pleasure"
3,Very helpful but lacking,I admit this book is a lot better than I thought it would be.I'm glad I didn't pay the nay sayers any mind.Though I have decent drawing skills not good enough to be considered a master but not a beginner either.I still think in order to improve your Artistic understanding of anatomy this book is a good start in the right direction though I still recommend you draw people who are willing to model for you or take a life drawing class if you are of age.
3,Just okay...,"The concept of this cookie cutter is okay, but you really could do the same thing by using a knife and cutting the lines for the pinwheel by yourself. If you don't trust your cutting skills, I would say to buy this."
5,A hip hop Classic!!,"One of the most incredible albums from an era when hip hop was actually good. This album ranks as my second favorite album behind Yeshua and SIah DaPoed's EP, get this album for Breeze's incredible lyrical style and rhymes. Not only is he mad talented he is also a real cool cat I met him at Fat Beats where he was working. This is one of the illest albums ever unless you are a fan of corny Hot 97 rotations or are pumping Right Therre or Lumidee in your car SUCKER!!!"
2,just okay,This book was just okay. Not as Christmasy as I was hoping for and not very well written.Wouldn't recommend.
5,It must not go out of print!,"I believe this title was out of print for some time. We are to be thankful to Transaction Publishers for bringing it out in a new edition. This is one of the best anthologies of modern religious thought and philosophy. It is ably edited, with a long and useful introduction by Professor Kaufmann. I will use it as the centerpiece of the course in the philosophy of religion I will be teaching this fall..."
5,Best Record Cover Ever!!,"Why wasn't this picture used for the cover of the full-length album rather than the single? How is she standing on grass with high heels? Did Jay-Z have a hand in the design and/or approval process? Is she parodying herself? Could she have done a better job of smiling with her eyes? Is the implied ""Z"" in her pose intentional? Is she being ironic? Does it matter?Seriously. This cover is awesome for so many reasons. I'm guessing that most of these reasons are unintentional."
1,Where is the Full Length Freemasons Mix?,"The remix that we want is the full length Freemasons Club mix. Why is it not included on this single. It appears on the ""Irreplaceable"" single, but only as a shortened edit. I don't know why artists and labels pay for remixers to remix their songs and then not release them. A lot of people hear a version of the song that they like, and buy the single only to discover that it is not included on the single. This is bad PR for the remixer, the label, and especially the artist. However, the artwork on this CD is amazing. The art director(s) really did a great job. She looks so strong, yet so vulnerable. I also loved the artwork on the B'Day CD."
2,bought the wrong one,"I clicked on the wrong disc. This has the album version as well as others, but not the Freemasons' version which is the only great rendition. I had to pitch this one and buy the version I wanted."
1,OH MY GOD - THAT PICTURE,"What inspired this picture. That is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. I laughed till I cried. Forget the song, the picture's worth a billion laughs and tears!"
3,Aggressive Beyonce,"For so many artists, they try a different edge on a song to flex their muscles. Unfortunately for Beyonce', she seems a bit angrier on her latest single, Ring the Alarm, the second single from her sophmore solo album B'Day. Although the song has a nice beat, it really isn't as appealing as her time with Destiny's Child. She tries to have a harder core on this song, as feeling she is trying to be like Mary J. Blige, Lil' Kim, and some other Hip Hop personas. I just hope that she tries to improve on her next single. She has a long way to go, don't ring the alarm on this song.Song: C"
4,Domestic violence,"Had to watch this for a Family Law class. Very real, can be harsh. Extremely well acted, however, subject is very depressing."
2,Bad transfer. No better than a regular DVD.,"One of my favorite movies, but a deeply unsatisfying transfer to Blu-Ray. I've watched about a dozen Blu-Ray movies lately and this is easily the poorest transfer. I own this on regular DVD as well and was looking forward to an upgrade - pristine transfer, incredible colors and soundtrack - only to be let down with a noisy image, flat colors and soft focus. I'm going to compare - I'm not convinced it's as good as my regular old DVD.A complete rip-off and the studio should be ashamed to issue this lackluster effort."
5,Duelling banjos and a lot lot more,"I have always known the movie 'Deliverance' because of the dueling banjos tune and that is why I finally wanted to see this movie. Turns out that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time.It is the story of four Atlanta businessmen on a rafting trip. While on the river they encounter some 'crackers'. One of the four gets raped and the other almost before one of the businessmen (someone who does not believe in law) kills the attacker with an arrow. Because the whole valley will be flooded soon they decide to leave the body there and tell no one. The one with a heavy heart falls overboard however.What is right? What is wrong? are questions asked in this movie and no one is sure. The movie is very disturbing, a strange look into the human mind and human society and also that part of the world where civilization as we know it does not exist.The duelling banjos are fun, but the movie is really good."
4,Disturbing but excellent,"The performances were excellent and the story was riveting, but like any story that explores the depths of what human beings are capable of, this movie was deeply disturbing. This is a great movie, with the story, direction, location, and the acting all simply excellent. There are some truly great actors in this film, and they all give outstanding preformances; they really make the experience real by staying true to the characters as their circumstances - and the characters themselves - change over time. I found myself thinking about these characters and reliving the images in my mind long after the movie was over. It was very well done and intriguing, but I don't think I would watch it again (which is why I gave it 4 stars - I think it has little replay value). I just found it a little too disturbing."
5,Very good one,"There are several reviews concerning the plot of the movie. But few of them adress the issue of transformation and fear inside all of us. I belive that the most important aspect of the movie is that it confront us to what we can became in a given situation. 4 regular guys transform into something you woudn't belive as the movie advances. And so do you. The fears and ""domestication"" of urban people desapears and transforms'em into a primitive state. What happens to Jon Voigt's fear of killing a deer? or the clumpsyness that they all showed up at the begginig of the movie?At the end of this movie you should ask yourself what would you be capable of in that given situation?Really a great movie, great performances."
3,A bit silly...,"So, I will begin by saying that there is an obvious reason to watch this movie. It is billed as a cult classic and a must watch 70's offering. If you lived in the 70's, or wanted a small picture of some of the issues, mentalities and styles of the era, this is a decent film. If you are looking for depth in plot or sense to be made, look elsewhere.In short, if you want to feel immensely more intelligent that the actors, watch and keep track of all the times they do things you would never do. Soon, you will realize that this movie may be best explained as a treatise of what NOT to do in unfamiliar rural territory.Interesting cameo of the sheriff at the end is the actual author of the book that this movie is based upon.There is a short segment of rape in the movie that should not be shared with children, of course."
5,Good old classic movie,"My husband had mentioned he wanted this movie for Christmas, so I purchased it for him and he was happy"
3,pop culture references,"Having heard all the scary stories and pop culture references to this film, I finally saw it for myself, and it is as strange and scary as it has been represented to be. It also certainly casts a long haze over any future travels to rural Georgia. References from this film permeate popular culture, ranging from nods in other films and television (the familiar but ominous dueling banjos, the snorting pig/Ned Beatty scene in the woods) to mentions in books, such as Bill Bryson's travel books (his account of hiking the Appalachian Trail begins in rural Georgia). A horrifying series of events befalls a group of men who are totally out of their element in the Georgia wilderness. Those who are left alive are traumatized into a kind of collective, humiliating silence. This is definitely worth watching, if not for the pop culture references, for the suspenseful and strange situations that happen in the mysterious woods."
3,"It's about survival, but I found it boring.","This is an old film starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds about a canooing trip gone wrong. I suppose at the time this film was released, the plot must've been novel and interesting. However, I found it boring. The dialogue was choppy. The acting was goofy. The plot was actually decent up until about halfway through the film. That's when things went downhill. Jon Voight turns into Rambo, and Burt Reynolds into a crying baby.More seriously though, I do understand the underlying theme of survival that the story tries to tell. Each of the 4 men on that trip represents a very different character. How they choose to deal with a situation says a lot about themselves. It's not a happy story.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 2 (choppy)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 2 (a couple of murders)P (Plot) - 3 (half the film was ok)"
1,Blu-Ray Review,"Amazon, again why won't you post my review?There is nothing Blu-Ray about this DVD. I'm sending it back."
2,A great movie? Maybe so... but also very unpleasant!,"I go to movies to be entertained, and this film was hardly entertaining. The characters aren't particularly likeable, the evil mountain people are loathsome, and when it was all over I wondered why I'd even bothered watching it. Like ""Schindler's List"", this may be considered a great film, but it's not near as uplifting or educational, and in any case I won't be watching it again anytime soon."
1,Deserves ZERO stars,"""Deliverance"" is to rural Southerners as ""Triumph of Will"" was to Jews. How surprising that it was made by a limey. If this movie had been made about blacks, it would have been banned. But who cares about Southerners?"
1,noooo,i got this as one of my free dvds from columbia house a part of my into package and am going to be giving it to the pawn shop. movie wasnt too bad actually pretty decent until the great climax of horror that no other man should have to see with his own eyes neither be owned or played on my tv. it left me dissappointed and wishing i never saw it. but i wont ruin it for you if you wanna know go ask someone.
1,DONT BUY,"THIS IS THE MOST PATHETIC FILM EVER CREATED. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT IT., unless u like to see guys raping guys. this film has no good gore, no good story to speak of, no good fight scenes/action, and a bad ending. I can honestly say this is the worst movie i have ever seen. IF I COULD GIVE IT ANYTHING LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD."
1,EtOH needed...,"this movie kinda sucks... honestly I wanted to watch it for the banjo, but if you drink enough, you can get a good laugh out of it."
1,I hated it,I liked the actors but I hated the story it made me feel dirty and I counldn't get one very disturbing scene out of my mind. I hated it.
3,Deliverance Delivers......,"Although with a somewhat rather boring beginning, Deliverance does manage to give us a good, different movie...... with a great cast. When a group of friends go rafting, they have no idea what lies ahead for them. Deep in the back woods, they encounter a different ""breed"" of people..... a group of hillbilly inbreds! who do not have the best of intentions in mind when they see these men appear in their back woods. Some good scenes and above all.....really liked the dueling banjo scene. Good movie for the time."
3,ok,"this movie is ok i had buy because believe it or not i never seen it before. it was ok, but not too thrilling."
1,Example of poor quality of a good movie.,"Mine will be short and sweet. Disc played like it was suppose to. But the qualityof video was very poor, I have my regular DVD that played as plain as this one did.I noticed on the cover of the movie on the back it showed under ""special features,480I or 480P standard definition""Every blu ray that can play on a standard DVD player I do not want, I did not payover $2000 for a Sony 54"" in 1080P and over $300 for a sony Blu Ray Player to get thiskind of junk.Amazon should caution sellers if this is in their Blu disc to specify in thediscription. Also I am glad someone brought up the fact that one of Humphrey Bogartclassic was made in china with sub title, shame on Amazon."
5,"One of the best ""horror"" films ever made!","Many may disagree with my categorization of the Burt Reynolds/Jon Voight classic as being in the horror genre, but I think that that is where it belongs. What else can be more terrifying than four guys (also the dependable Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty) out for a weekend jaunt that turns wickedly into a battle to survive some very sinister hill dwellers?Tense and dramatic, the film features the quartet at their best. The photography of the lush Georgia mountains is breathtaking and the superb score, featuring the memorable ""Dueling Banjos"" heightens the on-screen happenings.As one that had read the Dickey novel before seeing the film, I found this adaptation to be one of the few times wherein the screen and print versions complimented and complemented each other."
5,Innocence of Nature is overrrated,"By Marisol Cervantes (Real name)What is supposed to be a wonderful excursion into a river before a dam is built goes terrorizingly wrong. These four urban, or suburban men meet not evil, 'cause the obstacles they encounter cannot be explained as such. It's simply their own naiveté and sheer ignorance and, yes, a little arrogance over simple people that clashes with that other kind of ignorance and, amoral? immoral? ways of people who live on the verge of oblivion. I understood John Boorman was a great director, hadn't had the chance to see one of his movies. With such scarce resources he triumphs in depicting masterfully how four human beings clash with impassible Nature, and, mid-trip, their confidence is mercilessly pealed, ravaged, & they start to doubt strongly whether they will live to tell it."
5,"Terrific, an all-time great","Perfectly executed movie which sustains its atmosphere of fright and danger right to the end. The film is remembered these days mostly for the unusually explicit hillbilly homosexual rape scene, and that indeed remains one of the most chilling episodes in cinema. But the movie has got far more to it than that - it's about the limits of human endurance, the connection and possible contradictions between morality and the law, and man's striving to dominate the forces of nature. Each time you watch it, it makes you ponder these questions. Very, very good acting, and by far Burt Reynolds' best film. Perhaps the reason it never won an Oscar is because some of its subject matter was just too sensitive in 1972."
4,It'll make you squeal like a pig,"A journey into the world of hillbilly's in the deep South. This movie is where ""Dueling Banjos"" got popular and young versions of Voight, Reynolds, and Beatty give excellent performances. The mountain people scare me. Some scenes are very disturbing but very memorable. A must see."
4,Deliverance,"Good movie for the year it was made. Have river rafted at the movie location, it brought back memories. Interesting to see the difference between movie shots and reality view."
4,Much better than I recalled. Ned Beatty's performance is the oft overlooked keystone of the movie.,"I had had never seen the uncut version of this movie previously, nor had I seen it on a big screen until 2010. This is a beautifully filmed movie (except for the bizarre looking day for night footage on the cliff). The performances are first rate, too (again with a lapse on the cliff). The best remembered scenes unfortunately overshadow in our collective memory the fine performances that include those scenes. Bobby's (Ned Beatty) transformation as his inner strength comes out plays in the background of Burt Reynold's and John Voight's more active and prominent performances but is really the keystone of the movie without which it would crumble."
4,The canoe trip from hell turned into film art,"""Deliverance"" is an excellent thriller about the canoe trip from hell.Director John Boorman manages to create an otherworldly quality in this film that lifts it above other films in the genre.There is plenty to enjoy here - the beautiful location photography, the subtle shifts of power amongst the men, and the excellent performances.There is even an environmental message as the misfortunes of the men can be seen as karma for the damage that developers are making to the river and for the disrepect the men themselves show towards the locals.A few illogical plot points are the only thing that let it down.There are no extras on this DVD - 2004 release."
5,Horrific and stunning!,"A great example of the fine line between the civilized world and the need to survive that is within us all. John Voight is awesome as a mild-mannered businessman who must think and act to get himself and his friends out of a terrible situation. His climb up a side of a mountain to stalk the gunman stalking *them* is a classic.A tale of survival, of man at his best... and worst."
5,Great movie,I love this movie. Maybe one day they will do a remake & have rob zombie direct it. I can't wait to get it.
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,VIDEO WAS AN OLDER ONE NOT THE NEWER 2011 VERSION WITH ALL THE NEW INTERVIEWS. DID DOT SAY IN EVERYTHING I READ WHEN CD CAME OUT. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
4,Powerful and disturbing,"This is a suspense movie that has much to say about human nature and physical nature, in the tradition called naturalism. It's best not to watch it at night as it will keep you awake."
5,Vintage movie,I bought this movie because one of the actors in it (Ronny Cox) has written a book about the making of the movie and was visiting my house! I wanted to refamiliarize myself with the movie plus get his autograph. :) It wasn't as scary as I remembered. But creepy.
3,"Three stars for the picture quality, not the movie",I agree with Tuco about this one. I noticed the difference in quality when I watched parts of the documentary and immediately saw that the colors were much better on the clips there than in the movie I just watched. There also seemed to be more fuzziness in the feature. Could it be that they improved one aspect of the original and missed the other? Where's Criterion when we need them?
3,good,"Good movie, but I was expecting more action and horror. I've never read the book, but I've heard people say this is a good movie, and I've also heard it's name pop up in a couple other movies (the Blair Witch Project and Wrong Turn) so I decided to check it out. I was expecting this movie to be scary but it really wasn't. The only scary thing about this movie is that you know something like this really can happen in real life. The rape scene was also disturbing but after that it seemed like nothing else happened. The acting was good, but like I said before, the movie just lacked action. I found myself sitting there saying ""Ok, when is something gonna happen??"" a few times, and when the movie ended I was like ""Is that it?!?!"" It was a good movie but I was a little dissapointed."
3,A BREAKTHROUGH IN CINEMA - BUT NO CLASSIC,"They say that time is a healer, sadly however this is not the case with Boormans 'Deliverance'. As thrillers go it stands up well to todays regular 'trash', however failing to ever impact on the viewer enough to leave you on edge. Despite commendable performances and harrowing scenes the film drifts along for long periods with no saving grace from the script. Indeed, you could also argue the case for a rapidly composed ending, which seems to leave many relevant questions unanswered for no apparent reason. Saved by scenes such as the 'dualling banjos' and Boormans classy direction, Deliverance is rightly plauded by the critics for its cinematic bite and influence on Hollywood. Alas, it really is a shame the storyline is largely toothless."
1,This is a very poor transfer: A waste of money!,This transfer is so bad that a hair from the original film transfer pops up in the middle of the screen. Blu-ray is supposed to be a step up from a standard DVD. This is a piece of junk.Don't buy it!
3,Not as strong as Monsters and Robots,"This CD is not as strong as ""Monsters and Robots."" It displays Buckethead's humor though."
5,undiscovered gemstone of pure rock fury!,"Weclome to Bucketheadland, ladies and germs! Who is Buckethead? A fifty-foot man with a white plastic face, carrying an enormous guitar, rocking Tokyo like Mothra or Godzilla, friend of chickens and children- master blaster speed fingers blur and whir over dizzying chords that could have confounded Bach and Beethoven! Look out for Onions Onleashed, the scary scarecrow down from his stick and thirsty for firewater to give him the courage to shoo those pesky crows. Is that Iggy Pop on vocals? Throat Rake, Bootsy Collins? Legendary Bill Laswell produced this masterpiece of sonic savagery, and in the midst of this firestorm of guitars and Pinchface drumbo drums, a simple song like ""I Love My Family""?!!! Sony Records tried to bury this music, but you can't keep a good CD down. Twice the price is cheap for this keeper!"
3,Moments of greatness,I would've enjoyed these songs more with a little less vocals. But songs like Buckethead's Toystore and Welcome to Bucketheadland are quintessential Bucket.
4,It was good,"first of all i heard some buckethead then i picked random buckethead cd and it was enter the chicken (TERRIBLE) then i got this cuz hes one of the best guitarists ever. I put 'er in and this annoying voice comes on. so anyways to cut to the chase i loved most of the songs but the voice annoys me to no end. The song welcome to bucketheadland is great untill ""centipede woman"" comes on and screams stupid crap. Binge and Grab is sooooo great it amazes me. I still think that thru all of the dialogue its still a great cd, and i would suggest it to someone who already likes buckethead"
5,Great movie!,"If anyone saw the first Blues Brothers you will love this one as well! I got this for my boyfriend. After watching this movie, he says he seems to like the first movie better but I would say I like this movie better. As with the first movie, the music in the movie is great! Funny scenes too! I would say more but don't want to ruin it. I would recommend to purchase this and from this company. Item arrived at time expected."
2,You guys had 18 years.All you can think of is this rehash.,"BB2000 is pathetic.There is not one laugh in the entire thing.Maybe a chuckle at the part where Elwood visits Cab for the first time but that's about it.The movie thinks that just because we saw the original 18 years ago we'd forget all the humor and laugh at it again and think its completley original.John your cheating us.The only thing that saves it is the music and the acting.The performers were really top notch.But really what was the point of the kid?For Elwood to be a hero to excon's single fathers everywhere?speaking of Elwood,Dan Akroyd did not look like he was having that much in this.The first one you could tell he was having fun but here he just acts bored.There could have been a more original plot here.What about if their was a prequel and you had somebody young to play Elwood and somebody young to play Jake.Or since music is the only rodeming quality,why not just make a concert film?Good idea no."
2,"Good Music, Sloppy Movie","I have to give some credit to this movie for its grand music at the end. Otherwise, though, its fairly bland. The story lacks the ingenious humor of the original and John Belushi is badly missed. Elwood then loses something because he now has to take the front role, thus losing his monotone quality that was so much a part of his character in the first film. This battle of the bands, however, is a real plus. Seeing B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Charlie Musselwhite etc. on stage together was thrilling."
3,Great music.,This is a very bad movie but that is no reason to rent it because the music is so good.
1,Good music Bad movie,"The music is good in this movie, but I barly got through the movie. The acting is bad, the story is stupid. And all the magic crap screws the whole movie up. Get the sound track but dont waste your money on the movie"
5,I like this Movie because it is good.,This movie is very good i recomend it if your in the mood for laughs and action.
3,"Music was great, movie wasn't as good as the orginal",The music in the movie was great. Great stars and the return of some great stars. But the movie didn't have that same ol' feeling of the orginal... just isn't the same without John Belushi.
3,"Good music,but.","Blues Brothers 2000.A blues muscian who has done his time in jail creates a major band which the Police,White supremists,and Russian mafia are constantly after.A most dreadful plot,but excellent muscians who perform admirably several times"
5,"A great follow up to the blockbuster ""The Blues Brothers""","Blues Brothers 2000 has many of the same great types of scenes that The Blues Brothers has. Great car chases, police car pile-ups, and music that will have you tapping your feet all the way to the end of the movie. Most of the original cast appear in this movie, which makes it even better. Personally, I enjoyed this movie more than the first. John Goodman is a great addition to this movie. And you know? I didn't know he could sing."
3,"Don't watch, but listen!","Some of the music in this movie was just incredible, especially the Louisiana Gator Boys. The movie had some great actors, but the plot suffered and their acting skills couldn't make up for it. But what the DVD version can offer: skip the blah scenes and go right to the music. The movie's not worth watching, but it's definitely worth listening to! Okay, there are some corny songs in there, but man, most of the music in this movie is just sweet. In fact, whenever this movie was on TV, the music kept me from changing the channel."
3,well not bad for a sequel,the reason i rated this movie 4 stars was cause i like the music and the musicians.
5,old but still funny,This is a classic movie. It has a huge car crash scene and lots of music. Great dance routines and lots of stars.
5,Blues Brothers 2000,"Blues Brothers 2000 [Blu-ray]What a great movie sequel. The music and musicians in the movie were some of the great modern rock/blues and R&B; players of all time. What a great band, even if they only played in the movie. The Louisiana Gator Boys. Must have cult movie."
4,Not as good as the 1st,"if you have seen the 1st blues brothers, then you will kno that you can never replace it, but blues brothers 2000 is a pretty decent sequel. a lot of the same big musicians came back, and john goodman took over where john belushi left off. it is still a great movie, but will never beat the 1st."
2,"Terrible movie, great music","Blues Brothers is considered one of the Great American Movies - it reintroduced one of America's original music styles to a new generation in the context of a hilarious movie. But Blues Brothers 2000? Well, the replacements for John Belushi fall very short. The plot is awful. The story doesn't hold together.The one thing going for it is the amount of musicians introduced. If the original movie brought 8 or 9 musicians to mass appeal, this introduced 15. Unfortunately, it was all in a monster jam at the end.You're better off just buying the sound track."
3,"Sadly flawed, but lots of great music","And- great musicians! Almost every ""name"" in R&B;/Blues who was available in America has at least a cameo here in this ""sequel"" of the ""Blues Brothers"". So, yes, the plot is even sillier than the first, and some of the acting makes me wince, but watch the film for all those great cameos (nicely shown during the end credits) and the great music.Just don't think about the plot too much, OK?"
5,What a great follow up to the original Blues Brothers movie!,"I have been waiting for this to happen for many years. It is definitely not a second rate sequel. This movie has done what few have and that is improve on the first. The passing of John Belushi almost made this movie impossible, however the writers did a great job in taking this script to new hights. It is definitely one to add to your video collection!"
1,This movie stinks,I was tremendously disappointed by this movie. It stinks. What a disappointing sequel to such a brilliant movie (the original Blues Brothers). Don't waste your time.
2,not a good sequal,"well... i tried to like this movie, i really did. being the huge blues brothers fan that i am, i was so excited to hear about this long awaited sequal. i even saw it twice at the cinema... and i bought it on dvd... but i still cant stand it. its jsut not even the same type of movie as the original, its been transformed into something that would apeal to little kids. where are all the ""F"" words that john belushi said to make the original so hard edged and funny? and one more thing... NOT ENOUGH CAR CHASES! im sorry but as much as i hate to say it, this is a real bad movie. im just happy to watch the original over and over again, and pretend that the sequal doesnt exist."
4,PASSION FOR BLUES,"I think that the creation of the Blues Brothers was one of the best ideas a person could ever think up! Before seeing BB2000 I didn't even have a good idea of what Blues music was like. Since seeing this great movie with a simple but very entertaining storyline I sought out the original and have bought the Blues Brothers CD's. Blues Brothers 2000 is funny, and Buster is a great character to have in the new film. I prefer the original, but at least the sequel is different, not the same storyline.Using most of the original characters with a few new editions is a marvellous idea and it worked really well. This film is a must for anyone who enjoys listening to Blues music, and enjoys lighthearted comedy!"
2,"The feeeling is gone... Good Cast, bad movie.","I cannot understand how people gave a 5 start rating to this movie. Especially if you compare the whole thing with the original blues brothers... Good sound and music, lots of stars, but the jokes are all the same, the story is boring and not funny. Too much based on Dan Aykroyd, who appears to have lost his Elwood spirit (eats hamburgers etc.). I think the last 15-20 minutes of the film was fine(the song contest) and it was thrilling to see all those blues giants jam together. The rest of the movie belongs to the trash can. I'd recommend you to buy the superb soundtrack rather than watching this film."
2,Great!!!,"I watched this movie, then I rewound it and watched it again. The next night, my wife was home, and she watched it with me.This week, I saw it again, and it was still GREAT! 'Nuff said??Of course, if you don't like the blues, you might as well forget it."
1,What the Heck,"I ordered a new Blues Brothers 2000 and when I opened it, the disc is scratched and is unable to read. How can I exchange this or get my money back for it."
1,"Terrible, just terrible...","I watched this movie years ago, and throughout watching it I realized it was absolutely god-awful. I wanted to just stop the tape many times throughout watching it, and return it to the rental store. It was not worth the 2 hours of my life to watch the BB return to the big screen. The kid is annoying as hell, John Goodman could never fill the big shoes that John Belushi left. The police car crash scene is too long to be belieavable and it ends up not being funny. Don't bother paying to buy this piece of garbage!"
3,Music from the Legends is the best part,"The slender plot of this movie is just an excuse to string together great (and altogether too short) performances by Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, James Brown, Eric Clapton and others. Basically Elwood Blues is out of jail and is trying to get the old band together again. In the course of this endeavor, he is pursued by the police and Russian mobsters and he manages to steal $500 and kidnap a 10-year-old boy from an orphanage in the process. There are a lot of chase scenes and there's a bit of voodoo and lots of stunts thrown into the bargain. It's not a stellar production, but the music makes it worth a look."
3,Jake Deserved Better and so did I...,"Let me start by saying I wanted it to be good. The first installment, to me was absolutely amazing. It had something truly special that made it stand apart from most movies. It had a grit and an attitude, a foundation of cool. This movie does not stand up the same way. The shots and even the clothes were too sterile and clean. Sometimes the easiest way to kill a sequel is to have too much of a budget. That gives too many options and too much planning all the while losing site of the unique feel that made the other one such a classic. To me it seemed like a TV movie compared to the original. The only saving grace was the music. I would have preferred a concert video of the so called Louisiana Gators 100 fold over this. Jake Deserved Better and so did I..."
3,Give it a chance,"I won't even bother trying to convince you if you are set against watching it, but if you have misgivings, like I did, I urge you to give it a chance. You won't regret it.It's not as good as the Blues Brothers, but then it's not as good as Driving Miss Daisy either. Why not let the film succeed on its own terms rather than coparing it to the other film in the series?The stand out performance has to be Aretha Franklin's Respect. Quite why that song didn't feature in the original in place of Think is beyond me."
4,Love it or hate it,"You either love or hate this movie.. Before viewing it, I was afraid it was going to be a copy of the original. But, while the situations the Blues Brothers get in are exactly the same (i.e. a church-scene), they are all modernised to fit the 90s. That's a good thing and I enjoyed the movie all the way through. It will probably help having seen the original first."
4,Satisfying but not filling,"So I have rented the movie once, saw it once, but right after I rented it I went out and bought the soundtrack, but not the movie. So that sums it up for the movie, the music is great, especially if you like blues/R&B (The Gator Boys 'Dream Team' band at the end is especially memorable). But the movie itself is just so-so. The villains are not as fun as the original. I prefer the Good Ole Boys, The illinois nazi and even the guy who played X in the X-files to the Russians, but still, the music makes the movie"
3,Not A Good Sequel,"Blues Brothers 2000 is a sad sequel to a wonderful film. If your a fan of the first, see this movie only for the music. I was disapointed in the quality of the script. Unlike the original, which had a tight script, Blue Brothers 2000's scripte lags and is weak. In my opinion they should have left out the kid, Buster, and Mighty Mac, and had Elwood, along w/ the band, try to get Cab to join up. The crashes where great and so was the way Elwood parked. I thought the ending, however, was too abrupt."
4,Long but still worth it,"I am a very big fan of Blues and rock music. This movie is definetly a continuation of the story of the Blues Brothers, and has a lot of similar actions to the original (car wreck, cops, extreme actions) but is different. John Goodman makes an excellent addition and I am glad they did not try to replace Belushi or Calloway with other actors as that would pull away from who they were. Well worth adding to any collection especially if you like the blues and liked the first movie."
1,Absolute crap movie this is CRAP. doesn't deserve one star,I don't know who could make a movie this terrible. it is cra
2,Nowhere near as good as part 1,"Unfortunatley for all John Bleushi/Blues brothers fans, this movie was a huge disappointment, and not really worth waiting for.The movie plot was similar to its smash hit 1980's prequel minus Jake(The late, great John Belushi)(We all miss you John). Elwood wants to get the band together again(Doesn't the idiot remember what trouble it got tham all into 18 years ago?), only this time its harder because they all have lives and careers of their own, and after taking 10-year-old Orphan, Buster, under his wing, the police think Buster was kidnapped and are hot on Elwood's trail.A highly predictable movie. The only reason it rates 2 stars is because Dan Akyroyd is in it, and the songs are still funny."
3,They have improved on the first one!!!,"We decided to have a Blues Brothers marathon and rent both films. The saddest part was they were both on DVD and our equipment broke before we could watch Blues Brothers 2000. Switching to VHS was a downgrade, but Blues Brothers 2000 was MUCH better than the first. Now we have ordered the DVD and can't wait to watch it again, and again...."
1,This movie made me physically ill,"I rented this movie back when it was a new release at Blockbuster. As I was laying on my futon, about halfway through, I became physically ill. I started to sweat, my stomach was aching, I felt like I was going to barf. I had to shut the movie off and go downstairs. I sat with my mom who was reading a magazine and I felt better. I can only assume that this movie was the cause of my ailments. I still have never seen the rest of the film, but from what I remember it was garbage."
1,Don't bother,"As a huge fan of the first Blues Brothers movie, I was very excited to hear that a sequal was being made. I thought that without John Belushi, the movie wouldn't be the same. I was right. After seeing the previews and heard the reviews, I still saw this movie against my better judgement. It was one of the worst movies made. How the Blues Brothers went from one of the best to one of the worst is beyond me. If you are a fan of the first, DO NOT BUY THE SECOND!"
1,Sad Sad Sad,"What a huge waste of time and talent. All the charm and good feeling of the first film are nowhere to be found here. It is replaced by soul-less Disney blues and badly delivered 'jokes' that even Bob Hope would have turned down. The first film introduced me to a whole new world of music. This one, had it come out when I was 14, would have driven me away. All involved should hang their heads in shame."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.,"There are so many things wrong with this film,one cannot be sure quite where to begin.The lack of plot?The lack of enthusiam from the actors?The terrible musical sequences?Don't even bother renting this dud."
1,One Word: CRAPTASTIC!,"Thank goodness I only rented this pice of crapulence only one time. This film is not funny one damn moment! No where near as good as the original. No disrespect to Dan Akroid, but it was a mistake for him to be in this film, if you can call it a film. Whoever came up with the idea to make this film should be given a good hard slap on the face!"
1,Disappointed I couldn't give ZERO stars,"While John Goodman tries, he fails. This movie is more of a sarcastic twist off Blues BROTHERS which is a great movie. They tried to make Blues Brothers (ThE FAMILY MOVIE) well, blues brothers aren't about making the 3 years old smile....This should be called the KID VERSION of Blues Brothers---don't waste your time"
1,Cobra sucks cobras,"Cobra is the worst example of military sf ever. There's no structure and terrible pacing. The characters are weak and pointless, and I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Timothy Zahn has so much talent, which is why this was obviously written by his evil twin Nhaz Yhtomit. Read Ender's Game, or even Starship Troopers, butI'll put it this way. Tim Zahn pointed his fingertip laser at the bullseye, missed, and hit me instead."
3,Compressor,"It was an ok product, price, and arrived on time. It did fall short in one area that made it closer to cost effective to what I could have gotten locally, it did not incluse the oil and o-ring/gasket kit needed to install it. I had to spend about $20 more and buy both of them locally, which is why it only gets 3-star."
3,writers block review,"Writers Block sums up every writer's dream--that their character can come to life. Or could the dream turn into a nightmare? what if the dream lover of a romance writer's fantasies turns out to be the murderer in her recent crime novels? Morgan Fairchild is thwe writer, her character come to life played by the gorgeous Michael Praed, who is the best thing about the movie, tossing his mane of hair and turning from prince charming to a killer in an instant. Some boring bits when he is not on screen, but a fun movie for, maybe. a girly night in..."
1,do not buy,"Don't buy this or anything from this company (Macware), you will never get any support or update.They just cheat people with old version, and you can't get any support.We have profs about what we are saying, it's bad and sad that some company dos work like this.Just find the original author, there you will get update and support."
4,HOT FOLLOWUP,"Man after the hilarious concept album Infesticons, Mike Ladd comes up completely unexpected with the alter-ego of Infesticons with the Majesticons! PArty based jams from the enemy of hip-hop, too bad this album is so packed with ill beats, hilarious lyrics and catchy melodies that one will wonder if the infesticons can defeat the majesticons! Quality music all around from one of the best hidden wonders in hip-hop. Oh and too all you backpackers, open your eyes cause just cause the 4 elements arn't mentioned in every line doesn't mean its not hip-hop! ONE!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Overrated,"I was really expecting more from this recording. I am disappointed by the tempos Stokowski took, they are slower than I'm used to, especially in the furious sections of the 2nd and 4th movements. Things seem a little underrehearsed, for example, tempo changes aren't very tight, playing seems to lack a coherent style. What really ruins this performance is the clinky bells at the end of the 4th movement - instead of thunderously ringing out, they seem to disappear as if muffled. The sound is never as full and round as Rostropovich gets in his recording, I'd recommend his if you're looking for a moving performance."
5,Stoky wins,"Suffice to say this one of my desert island recordings. There are newer recordings with better orchestras but none of them is the searing and gut wrenching experience of this one. I still recall hearing this performance on a long-lost FM station when I was college kid (over 40 years ago.) I sought it out and have lived with it ever since. I can't fathom the review that says the climaxes are missing. The Depriest is recorded at such a low volume level that I thought there was something wrong with my equipment when I put it on. (There wasn't.) Some of the Russian conductors have done well with this sadly underrated work. Stokowski, however, may be unsurpassable."
3,Bossa Nova Muzak,"I am a big bossa nova fan, and I knew a couple Ary Barroso songs (he wrote before the bossa nova era) had been turned into classic bossa nova hits: Pra Machucar Meu Corao by Stan Getz, Brazil by Joo Gilberto. I wanted the album so I could hear more. I am glad to have these rare melodies in the style I enjoy, but the tracks are without imagination. They really were intended for elevators, I am sure."
4,Crist's book is a must-read if you want to understand what the winners understand,"I recently read this book. Even though nobody is going to read it and say, ""Eureka! I can finally quit my job!"" it still qualifies as a must-read.His explanation of exotics will help a lot of people understand how exotics really work. (You probably think you already know that. <G>) I think more than a few people will see where they are going wrong and, perhaps, how to correct their approach.I buy just about every horse racing book that comes along. The $20-30 is not important. It is what I may learn from a book versus the time it takes me to read and digest it. Most books I read are a total loss but admittedly I often check out by the third chapter. This is one I was glad I read.Simply put, there aren't enough high quality books out there from a source such as Crist. Just order it.Dave Schwartz"
3,Hitting the big one,"Easy read, somewhat informative - a lot of it is common sense, but interesting to see how someone else thinks. No complicated mathematics, but some basic probability/statistics disclosed. Entertainining, no realearth shattering revelations."
3,"Technical, detailed and a bit difficult","I looked forward to learning a lot about trifectas (my favorite bet) and other cool wagers. The book covers all the exotic bets except the super high 5 (probably not available when this was published).There is a lot of math and that is probably good for advanced players, but not for me. I ended up searching the chapters for sectons that I could relate to.Multiraces exotics was a much smoother section than Intrarace exotics.I read the DRF a couple of times a week. I always check out Crist's blog. Sometimes I like his blog, sometimes not.It's the same with this book. Some of it works and helps, some doesn't.I can't recommend it to anyone except number crunching horseplayers. That type of player will enjoy this book. Everyday horseplayers (like me) will struggle with it.The bottomline is that I did learn how to play better, but it reads like a text book... 3 Stars"
2,Disappointed and short changed,"There are only 201 pages NOT 288. Mr Crist I think you could have done a lot better. For beginners it's difficult and boring. For regulars (me) it's not an easy read and it's boring. For advanced handicappers, I doubt there is anything new. I was hoping for inspiration. It's really ok with some new but a lot of refresher material. I had to force myself to keep reading. There are a ton of decimials and fractions that aren't necessary and hinder the reading. It has some tips and is a good review of the exotic wagers and why you should play them. It's by an industry expert, but needs help relating to the reader. It can help you but put on a thinking cap."
3,Nothing new,Book was sent in a timely manner and well packaged but didn't contain anything I already know.
2,okay...,"as a cello, violin, and viola player, i believe this album is not the greatest to demostrate the beautiful, lyrical sound of a cello, the music is overexaggerated has a very harsh sound that i dont believe the composer meant it to be. the player however does have nice dynamics but i believe they should think more about the tone of the music. (The instrument on this CD is a viola da gamba, not a cello.)"
4,Eleven horrible stories,"""For I have sinned - True storied of clergy who kills"" contains eleven horrible stories of pastors, priest, ministers, and nuns who commit the ultimate sin : they kill! In each story Mr John Glatt explains the perpetrators and their victims backgrounds, the act of killing, and what happens afterwards - all in vivid detail.The victims range from a 22-year-old woman to a couple in their 90s. In one story the murder weapon was found next to the Bible and in another the murderer later delivered the victims graveside eulogy.Mr John Glatt has done an excellent job with ""For I have sinned"". He pays attention to many details and he writes in an easy-to-read manner. It is one of those books that is extremely hard to put down. If you think you know your priest, then read this book. The victims thought they knew their priests....With 8 pages of photos."
1,Disapointment!,"I am a huge L&W fan but found this game very stupid and boring. Besides the confusion, I was sad to find out you are not really solving a crime but doing some strange ""guess the card"" game instead."
5,good game never played (lol),I can't wait to play this game one of my favior shows on telavision. Children really want to play I will make them wait.
4,Really good. At $10 less it would be great!,"Does exactly what it's supposed to even if it's a little pricey for what it is. I put mine on the torn up dash of my 1988 toyota pickup and let it stay there for a few days to take shape without velcro'ing it down. after a few days I went ahead and pulled it tight with the included velcro pieces and it's 1000 times better than the dash without the mat. The fit is perfect and even though it seems a bit much for a shaped piece of carpet, it's the best deal I could find and there don't seem to be any compromises in quality. Good luck."
5,well written and very funny,"A collection of fiction short stories based on Fraser's experiences as a young officer serving in a Highland Regiment immediately after WWII. The others in the series ""McAuslan in the Rough"" & ""The Sikh and the Dustbin"" are good too, but this one is the best. P.S: His memoir of the Burma campaign, ""Quartered Safe Out Here"" is outstanding."
2,Boring,"With all due respect to the Author's back ground and knowledge, I just didnt like this dry, cold prose. Certainly there is content, but you could never read more than a dozen pages because of the small font and the way it is explained. This book smelled more like a dry manual than a book from core java series."
2,Shallow coverage of every Java technology,"This book tries to cover every Java technology which makes it unsuitable for both beginners as well as for advanced programmers. It is unsuitable for begineers as it does not cover anything with proper introduction and it is unsuitable for advanced readers as it does not cover anything in sufficient detail. Java is a vast technology and it is seemingly impossible to cover every aspect of it in a single book. Most of the Java technologies (JNDI, EJB, SERVLETS etc.) deserve a book in their own right for a detailed coverage. If you are an experienced Java developer and looking for a book to supplement your J2EE skills, look for something else."
2,Irish smoked salmon,"This was not our favorite smoked salmon through amazon. It's overly fishy tasting and the skin is on one side so it's not a net 3 pounds. The one we prefer through amazon is the 2 pound Atlantic smoked salmon (vendor is J.R Mushroom) and is fairly close to the Scottish smoked salmon which is the gold standard. If you can splurge for the St. James Reserve Scottish smoked salmon (can't remember the vendor), you'll be very pleased as we don't think it can be beat anywhere and is a very special indulgence over the holidays or any time you have a hankering for top notch smoked salmon."
4,An excellent resource of info about the MacDonald's of Canna,"There are few books about this small Hebridean island, but J.L. Campbell has written a fully detailed book, giving the history of the people who lived on Canna as far back as the 13th century. As well, he explains their leaving and where they landed in America."
3,A love/hate relationship,I have completed some very wonderful and intricate DVDs with studio but after spending countless hours talking to tech support about no audio capture while uploading my videos and still not resolving the problems it might go in the trash. I have followed countless advice from them using regdelete to remove the software completely twice and reinstalling with no avail. The third try they took me through an extra step after reg delete and guess what? all my projects are now gone too. (except the ones saved to avi.) The program is wonderful when it works. Highest accolades when that becomes possible. Till then...I'm shopping
3,A reasonable book about an inadequate API,"The Quicktime API for .NET is heavily slanted towards content re-play rather than content creation. This book adequately covers the API, but doesn't make the leaps necessary to describe Quicktime.NET usable for content creation. Missing are memory management considerations, which are important when creating all but the smallest sample movies in Quicktime. The Quicktime system is huge and it's a daunting task to write one book that describes Quicktime's dot net API when the old Carbon and new-ish Objective-C APIs get all the development and documentation effort at Apple."
5,sweeet,this new cd from gorillaz is hot it has more rap and more evreyting its as good as the frist one. check it out you wont rergreat it
3,A bunch of 9 unreleased songs,"I think that this CD should have been released along with the Gorillaz debut album as a second disc! Don't get me wrong this disc is great,...just buy along with the Gorillaz' first disc. I like the animated pictures inside! Noodle is so adorable!"
3,gorillaz suplemental,"cool baby,this disc (clocking in at 37:47) is a rather short collection of the gorillaz b-side material. the best tunes are: the soulchild rmx of ""19-2000"", ""ghostrain"" & at the top of the heap is the beautiful ""12d3"". on the bottom rung of the ladder is the wiseguys rmx of ""19-2000"" witch would sound o.k. on a house mix cd, but on a album of ZOMBIE HIP-HOP it is miserably out of place.the collection would prob'ly merit 4 stars (or perhaps evan 5) ifit contained the amazing track ""dracula"" witch should have been on there debut and another b-side ""left hand suzuki method"", bothof witch were on the european singles. oh well it's still cool."
4,Great Album,"I have liked Gorillaz for about 2 years, or less, and this album is a good one. I've seen 2 videos on MTV2 (which I think is kind of better because I hate how MTV plays their channel, too many programs, barely any music!). The two were Clint Eastwood from the other album, and 19/2000, the soulchild remix. Take this piece of advice though, you WILL hate track number 3, because: it's 7 minutes long, it is just a bunch of music, nothing too neat, and it has the worst variation of the original 19/2000. I think the only song that can possibly be the reason for the parental advisory would have to be track 6. I heard stoned and a lot of reference of effects from drugs. Otherwise, this CD is pretty good, but with 9 tracks and 30-some minutes, it's not as good as it could have been."
4,Sweet but short.,"G-Sides is a nice remix album and if you are a fan of the original Gorrilaz album, you should definitely pick this one up. If you aren't, you probably won't like this one and if you have never heard the Gorillaz, you should check out their first album before you buy this one as it provides a richer and fuller base from which to judge their music.G-Sides contains only nine tracks. Two of them feel somewhat sub-par next to the others (the Wiseguys remix of 19-2000 and Ghost Train), but several of them are fantastic (the Soul Child remix of 19-2000, Latin Simone, and the Phi Life Cypher remix of Clint Eastwood). The Clint Eastwood remix is essentially unrelated to the original once you move past the bass line, but it is still a fantastic song, so who cares. The rest of the album is solid and 12D3 especially is almost hit material."
4,Not as Good as Demon Days.,"If you want a CD go with the first Gorillaz CD, or Demon Days.Not this, this gets old fast."
4,"Good, but reminds me to put back in the full length album","This is a very nice collection of remixes, but the self-titled full-length debut is still the best. You can listen to this album on repeat for a while before you feel a bit homesick for the original songs. On the remix of ""Clint Eastwood"" one especially feels a bit out of place, waiting to sing the chorus that never seems to come.This collection is nice to have, but it can never replace the self-titled ""Gorillaz."""
1,Disposable,"The only reason why any Gorillaz fan would buy this CD is for the throwaway Hip Albatross and the harsh, violent version of Clint Eastwood rapped by Phi Life Cypher. The rest of the tracks were already available on various CD singles. They should have included the full version of ALL the b-sides including Film Music, 911, and Tomorrow Dub instead of the generic 19-2000 remix done by The Wiseguys.[DW]"
2,Awful,"this album should have been left on the cutting room floor. it's awful. buy the first album ""Gorillaz' and/or ""Demon Dayz"" instead"
4,hey this ain't too bad,"hey fan of the gorillaz this album ain't to bad a little pricy but find used if you have credit card for here or at a recorde store the tracks on this album is good especially ghost train, faust, and hip albatross has a good sound and isn't that bad though really should add more to the album but at least their coming out with a new album at last ""demon days"""
5,Plays The Field,"A well researched, written and needed book on one of baseball's fascinating subjects: the baseball glove. Liberman has touched all the bases and ... fingers on thisequipment topic.My favorites and I'm sure many readers will find highly interesting, are the interviews with former and current major leaguers, the men who trusted and trust their living with this tool.It's a fine catch for any baseball fan."
5,Brilliant!,"This is a wonderful book. It's well written, has a good variety of information and is very attractive in it's presentation, plus it's ""accessible"" to all types of baseball fans. If you're a glove aficionado (which I am not) perhaps you'll not find all you would hope for here, but that sort of book wouldn't be anywhere near as useful. Oh, and I grew up across the street from Noah Liberman and we played lots of sandlot ball together, although I've not seen him in two decades. Reading his book makes me miss those good old days. I still have the glove I used back then but I have to admit it's got some mildew, and I know that's at least one strike against me."
1,Not What I expected,"Being a lifelong baseball fan and a collector of vintage baseball gloves for over ten years, I anticipated this book's release since the end of 2002. I'm extremely disappointed; trivial content, numerous mistakes, and lackluster photography. I was expecting a doctoral thesis but wound up reading a D- freshman term paper. I can name dozens of glove collectors who could have written a more informative book."
5,Lawrence Welk Christmas Shows,There are over 30 songs by great singers and the sets are just beautiful. Most of the singers have been on Lawrence Welk's shows for many years. They are all Very professional and well known.
4,Welk Christmas DVD,"It was what was advertised. I really enjoyed it. If they have more like it, I'll buy one every year. I grew up with my parents watching the Welk show every week. Very fond memories."

4,Beyond genre fiction,"This odd, deeply atmospheric novel is undoubtedly the masterwork of the eccentric Edwardian English wrtier William Hope Hodgson. It presents the haunting story of an old recluse who lives in a weird borderland between ordinarly reality and unspeakable horror. The tale is presented through the experience of two friends who discover an old manuscript in the ruin of a mansion while camping in rural Ireland. The papers describe the strange visions and terrifying experiences of the recluse who, together with his elderly sister, was the house's last living inhabitant. The story is powerfully evocative of the different kinds of evil that can befall a human mind. It should appeal to anyone who likes Lovecraft or Poe, but goes far beyond the limits of the horror genre in its imaginative power and artistry."
4,The House on the Border-Land and The Night Land,"Hodgson's master work is usually stated to be The Night Land, but in my opinion The House on the Borderland is better -- perhaps because it is shorter and it has more genuinely spooky action. It takes an effort to really get into Hodgson's prose style, but if you slow down and let your mind be lulled, his stories become quite engaging. The Night Land is flawed by his tendency to dwell too much on how many hours the central character walks or crawls, how many hours he sleeps, how many food pills he eats, etc., similar details of which we are spared in The House on the Borderland. Hodgson also has a romantic infatuation with simpering girl-women, whom he describes as ""My Own"" and over whom the narrator is the ""master."" This is outright cloying by modern standards. I am also struck by the interesting parallel of the quest in The Night Land to Tolkien's later narrative of Frodo's pilgrimage into the land of Mordor."
3,quality of print not so good,"My comment is on the format, not the content. I was disappointed with the quality of the printing (Classic Reprint Series). This book is a scanned reprint of an old copy of the book, and that's exactly what it looks like. This is not obvious from the ""preview"" pictures of the book here on Amazon. To get an idea, go to the publisher's homepage [..] to see some samples (the vertical blacks lines do not appear in the book though). It's a bit like a bad photocopy - little pieces of each letter are missing, and in some places, some (scanned) pencil underlining of the original also show up. It's readable, but despite the large font size it's tiring for the eyes, because the mangled letters give you the impression of looking at an out-of-focus picture. If I had known the print quality would be this bad, I would have paid more and gotten another edition or the hardcover."
3,a bit boring,"i love maugham, but not this. the book is a group of short, 2 to 4 page, writtings, like ideas to be used in an up coming book or something. there was never anything you could get your interest. of course it showed his fantastic ability to put a thought into words and his great descriptive writting. that said, i still did not like it."
4,Venture spirit reminder,"I've read this book to find out what motivated the people and companies in Silicon Valley which many other contries want to have one in their territory. It gave me lesson that the venture needs to be based on the acknowledgement of the understanding that the world is complex. Once take this granted,you can understand Hewlett and Packard did a great job and put a milestone to those who still can't understand the complexity of the society"
1,Feel-good story that is not deep,The book talked only about the success but did not give explanations on how HP failed in some of its decision makings.
5,THIS IS A REALLY FUNNY FIRST READER BOOK.,"The pictures are really funny and so is the story. It's about a drum playing bear who wants to hum.....but he's chewing gum.... What follows are the really funny antics that happen. I really like this book. So did my son. One reason was that starter books tend to be easier to read if they rhyme....but this isn't ""forced"" the rhymes seem to flow naturally"
3,sample is completely useless.,"When you download a sample, you expect at least a little bit of the meat of the book so you can see if it's worth buying or not. In the case of this book, all you get is how the author uses people's names, and part of a pronounciation guide... useless."
5,Perfect,"To me, Milstein was the greatest violinist of the twentieth century. He was a great technical player and was an eqauly good muscian. I love his playing! He plays most of the great violin concertos and plays them beuatifully. His recordings of the Brahms, the Tchaikovsky, the Beethoven, Saint-Saens 3, an Introduction and Tarantelle are my favorites. This CD is pricey, but at least put it on your Christmas list. I don't actually own I've just listened to it and it's great so buy it if you can afford it."
2,Disappointing to say the least,"Most of the info in this book is quite out of date (the book is a 1988 reprint of a 1961 book). I was expecting lots of good info on the technicalities of what is required for scientifically accurate illustrations but in fact that is only a small part of this book. Not a lot of illustrations either, so again not too helpful. All in all, a disappointing book that is way out of date and therefore not very useful."
1,EDITOR!,"This book first of all needs an editor to cut about 1/3 of the maundering. But the low stars goes for the mean spiritedness in this family. The low rent sister-in-law maybe a greedy gold digger but please--who said the children should pay for the mother's sins. The scathing treatment of the children is horrible. They are treated like her low rent offspring when they are also half the so called upper crust brother's. The upper crust brother who drinks, gambles and won't even buy a proper home to house his ever increasing clan. Even a new born baby is condemned as a devil's minion--no wonder they turn out 'witchy' when their own daddy showers more attention on the nephew and they get treated like dirt from the get-go. Grandmother has no trouble handing over $50,000 to her spoiled son w/o question but thinks Frances Mae is greedy for wanting more room for her children. I want to get to know these people. Not."
3,Plantation,"Plantation by Dorothea Benton Frank has been on the ""gotta get to this book"" list for some time. Now that a follow-up book, Lowcountry Summer, has just come out, I figured it was time to get to Plantation which I had downloaded to my Kindle last year.Plantation was a story of a family finding its true self again after years of misinterpretations and misunderstandings. I enjoyed seeing Caroline Wimbley Levine find her heart and home, although it seemed at times that she certainly was taking a lot of needless side trips along the way."
3,Plantation,"When I first read one of Ms. Franks books, it was Sullivans Island, and I could not put in down. It was, to me, a perfect book. But I'm really struggling with Plantation, it just doesnt seem as interesting or gripping. Will keep trying because I know she is an excellent writer."
3,liked it....,"but not enough to read again. I didn't really root for any character in this book. I enjoyed Sullivan's Island much more. This is only the second Frank book I have read, but I'm ready to read some more."
5,Awesome Author!,"Dot Frank has unsurpassed description ability; I felt as if I were there in the Lowcountry. She has the same talent for character development - I could easily identify with everyone in this fascinating story. There is also wonderful humor and emotion in this book; I was laughing in one chapter, and becoming teary in the next. I plan to read all of her other books!"
5,Love the humor!,With this purchase I've caught up with all of her low country tales. I can almost smell the salt water and I feel like I'm a friend of the characters! Sad when I've reached the end.
3,Ehhh,"This book was highly recommended to me, so I was very excited to read it. I was underwhelmed. It was ""just ok"""
4,Wonderful!!,"Dorothea Benton Frank is a very entertaining author, and ties her books together with different individuals. I have read everything she has written and will continue to do so. I love her writing and insights."
