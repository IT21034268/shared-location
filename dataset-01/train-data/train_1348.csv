2,"A ""plethora"" of falsehoods!","Okay, I admit it... I was hooked at first, but about halfway through, I got bored. This book was so predictable and I couldn't believe how many times the author used the word ""plethora""! Remember, this book is FICTION. Its interesting to read, but don't spend money on it... Do what I did and borrow it from a friend."
5,"Fascinatingly Intriging, Leaves you thinking","Hardcore closed minded Christians stay away, or be prepared with an open mind to the alternate perspectives of Jesus. From the minute I picked up this book I never wanted to put it down. I have never been so enthralled in the a book. The way the author keeps the reader suspended in unending mystery, and by the end manages to answer all your questions will have you spending every spare minute reading. I plan to read this book yet again in order to spend more time researching the topics discussed, and to spend more time understanding and analysing the code. I would suggest that anyone research these facts before taking them to heart, however if they should hold true, I would hope that the world has the chance to read this book, and others like it."
4,Not as bad as I thought,"I listen to this book. I must say it was not as bad as I was expecting. There were some boring parts that I would drift away, but something always brought me back to the story."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Very, very ordinary. A hodge-podge of infodumps of research and characters you don't learn anything about, it seems. That, and a crud ending. The writing is just average. Religiously soft, I suppose, is why people like it a lot, or that a lot of people have never been exposed to or read anything at all like that ever before."
5,Absolutely worth reading-Awesome read,"I have read a lot of Dan Brown's books and loved them but this is my most favorite of his books. I couldn't put it down.Great page turner.You find yourself disscussing this book with everyone.AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME!!!"
2,Did I buy the abridged version by mistake?,"Got mine at a rummage sale without a dust cover, that's why I ask. Thought I'd check it out because of all the recent hoopla. Seems to me that the subject matter could have been the basis for a series of novels or at least one big thick one, but Mr. Brown (or his publishers) decided to present a tidy little boiled down version. Unfortunately, the underdevelopment of the characters and the use of long french proper names makes the book actually hard to read, and definitely not a page turner for me.One can learn about much more shadowy individuals and intricate plots by just googling the words illuminati, golden dawn society, new world order, knights of malta, rosy cross, priory of sion, et cetera ad nauseum."
5,Surprising,"I was told that it most likely will not get here before Dec 24th (even though I ordered it about a week before), so I was prepared to receive it much after Christmas. Then on the 19th, it came! Nice."
4,Close to the best,"I had a very good time reading this book. I am fascinated by puzzles, word games and cyphers, and I have more respect for history and science than for blind religion. Therefore this book met all of my expectations. The author's style is particular (many very short chapters) but it fits the style of the story and it didn't bother me (unlike other reviewers). And the fact that the book (cover) contains a bunch of extra information you wouldn't expect (check out the book's web site) did feed my hunger for more puzzles and games. This book is close to the best you can get. Why not the best ? Because the author sometimes seems to add too much non-fiction (information) that is not enough related to the plot, just for the purpose of showing how much research he did - though the research is likely limited to the list of books included in the story. He should've avoided this pitfall, and the book would've been the best."
4,Raises some interesting points.,"I like books that challenge conventional beliefs with thought provoking revelations. Another book of this type is Kleier's THE LAST DAY (Warner Books), which goes even farther in its disclosures than Da VINCI CODE, into and beyond the secret sanctums of the Vatican Bibliotheca Secreta. There are some things God does not want Man to know (so think the patriarchs of the Church), and THE LAST DAY exposes the shocking, harrowing, and fascinating Truth. If you like the suspense of Da VINCI CODE, you will find THE LAST DAY even more intelligent and surprising."
2,yes no let me know,"the rage will be short live surviving only in church book clubs and oprah fans. a page turner all admitt, however, the premise of controversial religious topic is the real suspect to blame for gluing your finger to the page. the writting was mediocre not to ripe the book apart but i was just as enthused by picking up a goosebumps book. only suggestion- read it for yourself the opinions seem to vary drastically"
1,Amazing...,"What is amazing about this book is that it actually made its way into print and then was received as an intelligent work. Having lived in Paris, I can vouch that the descriptions of that city bear no relation to reality. The supposedly intelligent characters spend most of their time gasping in amazement over the obvious. The presumed history is anything but, and even the premise of the book, lifted freely from the Rennes-le-Chateau enigma in southern France, has been deformed beyond recognition. And lastly, the book is a rather large slur against Catholicism, painting the Church of Rome as alternately incompetent and psychopathic. I suppose that the book would not have annoyed me so much had it not come so highly recommended, and had not the author suggested that his work was factually accurate. I'm sorry to say it (I can't recall every giving a book one star), but at nearly every level, this book is just so much schlock."
1,"It's Fiction, after all.....","I keep telling people: it's a work of fiction. Gladly, the author never claims to be anything else but fiction. He confuses a lot of historical elements and passes them for facts by using the lecture style of the character. For example, all he says about the Gospels is completely inaccurate: he gives the impression that the 4 Gospels known to all and all others were written at the same time and then the ""church"" selectively chose the four. History doesn't agree. We have no proof. He even claims that Jesus wrote ""Q."" This document, ""Q"" is hypothetical (it's mostly a scholarly construct). As for the ""Da Vinci"" stuff, I am not learned enough to respond. For crying out loud: let's keep in mind that IT IS ONLY FICTION, poorly written, but still fiction."
1,Useful!,"I can stomach the average clich√©d, boiler plate, mildly-entertaining during a boring transcontinental flight type of thriller, but reading this ridiculously over-rated, mind-numbingly awful, mercilessly indigestible, flagrantly moronic steaming pile of excreta by that idiot-savant, Dan Brown, is somewhat akin to being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic while coming down with a bad case of intestinal parasites-- it's infuriating, nauseating, and indescribably awful all at once.On the bright side, you now no longer have to wonder which of your many friends and acquaintances have discerning taste and strong intellectual abilities, and which are the schmucks who squeaked by with a C average while majoring in communications at their third-tier liberal arts college; if they list the Da Vinci Code as one of their favorite books, don't be holding your breath for their Nobel Prize nomination."
1,'Best Selling' doesn't mean 'Best Writing',"This book is a good example of why the review ""stars"" should have the option to go below zero. I'd give it a minus two stars."
1,Mediocre writing and too much hype - bait and switch marketing,"This book is the definition of literary mediocrity. It's probably not the worse book I've read, but it's certainly not good.But the publishers used some smart marketing to dress the book up in some more intellectual themes of art, religion, conspiracy and enigma. I think that's why many readers are so disappointed.If this book hadn't sold so well, there would not be nearly as many controversial opinions floating around.I think most people -- myself included -- are really more angry at themselves for reading this really worthless book and at other readers for buying so many damned copies. I honestly expected something quite more literary than the action-movie script that it actually was. To me, this felt like a bait-and-switch."
3,Incomplete without Explaining Schizophrenia (Maybe Ron Howard can do it in his movie),"Dan Brown & Ron Howard's themes are incomprehensible without an understanding of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If u want to understand Jesus, John Forbes Nash, Da Vinci or the illuminati, u need to understand schizophrenia. I suggest Rodney St. Michael's books:1) Illuminati: Healing and Developing the Mind (ISBN:0595259669)2) Little Voices: A True Paranoid Schizophrenic Adventure (ISBN:0738823279)3) Sync My World: A SEA & Nautical Map to Relative Peace (ISBN:1411602862)Once u read these books, you'll realize how funny & incredible Dan Brown is!"
5,Could Not Put It Down,"This is the best intellectual thriller in a long time. This book has it all....murder, mystery, religion, art history, and puzzle solving. I immediately went to danbrown.com to check out the actual photos of the places and paintings he discusses in his novel. I've recommended this one to all my friends. Don't wait for the paperback!"
2,VERY unrealistic ... gets annoying toward the end...,"I'm glad I heard this book simply because it was such a popular book. However, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot, while moderately amusing, was NOT believable at all. Everything came too easy for them. They never mulled anything over. There were far too many ""aha!"" moments and that really annoyed me. I like the character Langdon a lot but the others were pretty annoying. By the last CD of this set, I was very tired of the whole plot, all the characters and was ready for it to be OVER. Mildly entertaining but not anything I would EVER listen to a second time."
5,Eye-opening,"Astounding information relating the Church and today's modern day affairs. The story's pace is fast and gripping. Plot may be a bit too complicated for some people but just right for me. Must read blend of history, action, suspense, and humor."
3,"Fun, fast read but...","I found it to be a bit self-congratulatory. While the word puzzles and riddles that make up the bulk of the story were clever, the effect was ruined for me when, after each one, Brown states how clever they were and what a genius the character who ""created"" them was. As a result, I read the book with the feeling that the author was telling me how clever HE is.Also, I've read most of the books Brown seemed to use as references, and he didn't seem to pick the best scholarship on the chosen topic."
3,Good research but way too many twists in the plot,"I'm not a Grail devotee, but it looks to me as if Brown's research on the subject (as well as on cryptography and symbology) is pretty accurate. But he needs to take lessons on thriller writing from the late Robert Ludlum.Although Ludlum's characters were larger than life his story and plotlines were always logical - you could pick up any of his books and trace out what happened and why. ""The Da Vinci Code"" relies far too much on coincidence and inference, and when the villain's identity was actually revealed the story and its author lost a great deal of credibility. Even more credibility was lost in the climax and anti-climax that followed.I can see how this book became so popular because of it's main subject (the mystery of the Holy Grail) and the obvious research that the author did on that subject. But as a thriller or mystery writer Brown falls far short of the mark."
2,"Stop, Go, Stop, Go","Well, it started out to be interesting with a good plot that included murder in the Louvre, secret codes, messages written by the victim during his final minutes, treasure hunts, clues within clues. But, there is no depth to the characters, no cohesion between lecture and action and no end to ridiculous conjecture, factual misrepresentation and theological misintrepretation.I have never before read the end of a book before I naturally got to it, but in the case of The Da Vinci Code, I was compelled to out of sheer frustration.In another vain, this book worries me. Will people read it and believe Brown's lectures on Christianity, Catholicism, etc. as fact? His history isn't even accurate.In summation, I would describe this book as disappointing and frustrating to read. I read a review that called the book ""perfect for ladies book clubs"" (which is why I read it). That's insulting."
4,A Good Read,I just recently read The Da Vinci Code and am still trying to figure out what the entire hullabaloo is about. The book puts forth nothing I haven't heard before. I find it sad that evidently so many people in the world have so little religious training.The Da Vinci Code is a page turning suspense/mystery. I truly enjoyed Dan Brown's writing.
3,A Few Additional Sources,"A fun grab bag! There is much to enjoy in this collection of historical parlor games that Mr. Brown playfully cobbles together using the thriller format. As near as I can tell, however, the lion's share of the grail storyline is lifted from HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL (a source Mr. Brown acknowledges in the text). HBHG is itself best read as speculative historical fiction. Readers interested in more of the straight historical record might want to check out Malcolm Barber's THE NEW KNIGHTHOOD (an objective and detailed history of the Templars), Susan Haskin's MARY MAGDALENE: MYTH AND METAPHOR, and, of course, the first (and possibly still the best) grail story, by French writer Chretien de Troyes. His PERCEVAL, OR THE STORY OF THE GRAIL (1186) is the one that started all the centuries of ""rewrites"" and speculation. It was a blockbuster in its day, and still reads beautifully -- full of wit, romance, adventure and authentic poetic mystery."
3,Well....,"The Da Vinci Code starts out well, and it is a very fast read, with an interesting premise.I was however more and more annoyed with this book by the page. The plot takes turns that are utterly improbable, every chapter ends in an annoying cliffhanger and I often figured thing out long before the characters. Some of the story of the grail is also quite far from the truth - I didn't appreciate certain historical liberties.Oh well. As a pageturning thriller it works quite well. I read it in under 24 hours - 3 sittings - which is fast for me although I'm an avid reader. If you don't have anything else to read and you need something to do, sure, but this isn't exactly quality literature."
1,If you like Grisham... maybe. If you like true literature..,"I must say this book is one of the most poorly written books I've read in quite a while. I suppose I must say it was entertaining, though not entertaining enough to buy, just borrow from a friend or the library. If serial novels and suspense thrillers are your thing, you might enjoy it. I personally could not even keep it. I bought it and swiftly returned it two days later. If you want suspense that is enriching too I would recommend Khaled Hosseini's ""Kite Runner"". That is a fantastic book."
2,"The ""unabridged"" audio book - missing half the text!","The unabridged audio audition of ""The Da Vinci Code"", read by Paul Michael, is a big dissappointment.Even though Paul Michael has a nice voice, his french is awful - so awful that i had to check in the book what he actually said. Then i discovered that huge parts of the text are not in the ""unabridged"" audio edition at all! Even if the ommitted pieces of text might not be crucial for the advancement of the plot, they often contain descriptions and information gving meat to the personalities and the happenings.When i buy an unabridged audio version, i do not expect every little ""he said"" and the like being recorded, but neither do i expect extracts, often as long as half a page, being ommitted.For me, the audio version was a vaste of money, as i will have to read the printed book instead to be able to get all the text, and not mainly the dialogs."
1,Don't bother with this book - read Umberto Eco instead!!,"I agree with the reader from Evergreen, CO - if you're going to write a book like this, do your homework first! I'm not an art history scholar, but I have two degrees in medieval history. The inaccuracy of the author's assertions about almost every historical reference I ran across in this book was appalling! I too tried to have fun with the story, but the bad research was so distracting that I never truly engaged in the book. If you are interested in reading a great book that also deals in similar subjects, go to the master - Umberto Eco - and read Foucault's Pendulum. Eco's breadth of knowledge is vast, and he deftly navigates not only history, but philosophy, theology, semiotics, philology, etc. and weaves them seamlessly into a captivating plot with 3-dimensional characters."
3,Da Vinci Code is a Goose Chase,"Unfortunately, Mr. Cook is very good at puzzles and very poor at ending an otherwise good story. If you have a liberal arts degree, or have read literature instead of pop culture story tellers much of your life, don't read this book. Well, at least only read it until the last ten pages then throw it across the room (to paraphase Dorothy Parker). That way you'll at least get more pleasure than waiting until after the last ten pages when you are so dissatisfied that you throw the book at a nice vase in your house. You will get all hot and bothered expecting a real, insightful, clever and satisfying ending. Instead you'll feel like someone got you all hot and bothered...then threw you into a cold shower."
3,An enjoyable summer read,"I read this book in one day and agree that it moves quickly and is enjoyable, even if the writing style is awful. Having been raised Catholic, I thought Brown's central message about how the Church needs to reform is sound, and a welcome message, even if his plot stretches the barriers of belief a bit much. Other books I would recommend for those interested in doing further research are: The Gnostic Gospels & Adam, Eve and the Serpent, both by Elaine Pagels, and any book by the German theologian Uta Ranke-Heinemann, particularly Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality, and the Catholic Church."
2,The Davinci Code,"The book is written well, however, the story has no truth to it.In my book of the bible it is written different. I hope the author will some day find the truth about Jesus, who is not at all, what he writes about. He is not just someone that has a fling with some woman. He is the Savior of mankind and the son of God."
1,Whatever happened to Faith?,"I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I got about 3/4 of the way through it and had to stop because I got so tired of all the mumbo jumbo and conspiracy theory. And if you really look at the theories, they don't make any sense. What this book failed to even acknowledge is that Christianity isn't based on proof. It's based on faith. Even though I believe that there is proof of Jesus Christ's existence and identity, more than anything I believe in the joy and love that he has put into my heart through a relationship with him. As far as I'm concerned this is nothing more than propoganda itself."
1,Christians Should be Horrified,"Never having read any of his books, the synopsis sounded interesting. However, as a Christian, I found this one of the most disturbing books in print. More credible scholars than Dan Brown, even those in the 1st century, agree that the formation of the Bible was accurate. Jesus was not married and did not sire offspring. None of the 456 Old Testament prophecies about Jesus mention a spouse or offspring, but the ones predicted came true. DaVinci talented/genius? Yes. We humans do not want to read that something we are doing is against His will, so we make up stories to fit our lifesytle. The Word of God was given to 23 men to share in 66 books. Woman are vital to the church, but not as Dan Brown would have you believe. Read the Bible, know the truth!"
3,Does DaVinci Code truly deserve so much success?,"I guess I'm one of those people who are looking for a rare gem to read, and was fooled into thinking I had found that gem. After all, how can 40 million readers be wrong? The DaVinci Code doesn't really deserve to be this successful, as it is not very original in its language, or truly spellbinding. The positive thing: I finally found that gem I was looking for. Creator, by Michael A. Hills, also deals with an alternative Jesus reality, yet this book is written par excellence. For most people the DaVinci Code is sufficient entertainment. Those looking for precious things though will have to look else where."
5,Amazing,If you love Dan Brown you will love this book. The pictures really bring a new understanding to the book.
1,PAGES MISSING - DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!,Do not buy this edition of the book! I recently purchased my copy and found pp. 267-98 missing.
5,Entertaining? Yes! Edifying? You Decide,"Since Mel Gibson's movie is being released today, I'm sure more people than ever will be reading The Da Vinci Code. I thought this book was a good one - thought provoking, entertaining, providing a good mystery filled with historical data. It seems to evoke either a very positive response from readers or a very negative one. Me? I loved it. It's been discussed at family dinners more than once, and each time, it's a thrilling discussion."
1,Irritating,"What was all the fuss about? Apart from the central idea regarding Jesus's lineage, which is interesting (but isn't exactly original) this is a tedious old read, full of dumb cliches, unbelievable characters (especially the villains) and with these ridiculous childish anagrams and puzzles peppered throughout which, I'm guessing, are supposed to flatter the reader into thinking he/she is some sort of genius cryptographer. Complete garbage."
5,It's FICTION Folks...FICTION!,"Plain and simple...This book is a FICTION novel my friends. There's no need to take offense to a novel written based on false ideas.As for the story, WOW! This thing was spectacular! I could not put it down. It starts off a bit slow (The first 80 or so pages), but then really gets going.You gotta get this thing. Best book I have read in years!"
2,This book is like Foucault's Pendulum....,"just written for slower folks, with all interesting mind fodder removed. I disagree with some of the other reviews stating this is a total ripoff.... even within the text Brown acknowledges that all of these ideas are old hat and have been for at least decades. As my title indicates, however, Umberto Eco was able to weave the old legends of the Templars into a much more relevant and poignant work. Besides, with Bush's current fantasia of rationales for provoking illegal wars, the nature of truth as elucidated in Foucault's Pendulum is much more pertinent."
2,Not as good as I expected,"With all of the hype I expected this to be plausable, gripping and exciting. It was none of the above. I am in the religion business and to believe this you have to suspend a lot of ""belief"" and accept things that are really outlandish. Despite the Catholic Church's checkered past, this is so beyond belief that no matter how much I tried I just could not accept its premise. Not only that but the ending is a real letdown. I found myself saying ""So......."" There are better things out there to read.... far more interesting and believable."
1,False teaching in the last days,"Oh yeah, I know it's supposed to be a fictional thriller about symbolism and mysterious puzzles; but there is a message here that is not well hidden or cloaked in secrecy: The attempt to discredit the claims of true Christianity, the innerancy of scripture, and the deity of Christ. (See chapter 55)"
1,junk history,"Are you wondering, like me, why this book remains a best seller. What can we expect from a country spoon fed history in 40 minute segments (after you delete the commericials)on the Discovery, Learning, History Channel etc. ""A little learning can be a dangerous thing."" Alexander Pope.Frightening in its ignorance. Dan Brown has made an appalling attempt to rewrite history, couching his ludicrous ""research"" in an insipid thriller.Educate yourself people!"
1,Come on now,I dont see anything interesting about this book nor the movie. This book is one reason why I only read fact. Just way to out of wack
5,An incredible book,"This is simply one the best books I've ever read and it has become one of my favorites.Once I began reading this extraordinary book, I could not put it down. ""The Da Vinci Code"" has extraordinary descriptions of places and characters. As soon as I began reading this book I was inside a wonderful world of increasing intrigue and mystery. This book even encouraged me to do my own research about Da Vinci's life and about the places and paintings described. This is a book I'll never forget."
3,Not Very Clever,"When you are used to reading material by Frederick Fosythe or Tom Clancy, this was really a sophomoric book by comparison. Yeah, the research was there, but I figured out most of the clues before they were revealed."
3,"Starts out OK, then runs out of steam -- and credibility","Dan Brown cleverly mixes suspense and history, but the story falls flat in the last pages. The finale is a letdown."
2,predictable and simplistic,"Another reviewer accurately terms the writing ""paint by numbers"" and I must agree. My family and I listened to the audio tape together and had predicted out the plot by the end of the first side of tape I. The concept is old, and has been better done by others. Very disappointing."
2,Very poorly written,"After all the hype, I was looking forward to reading this, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot may have been OK but the poor quality of the writing completely destroyed any potential enjoyment for me. Rightly or wrongly, I immediately dismissed the rest of Dan Brown's books as second-rate rubbish. This is surely a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes'."
2,"cardboard characters, cheap thrills","I had to read it because of all the hype. I gave it two stars because it was entertaining, at least. It was a page turner and every chapter ends on a cliff hanger. But the story is formulaic and the characters are made of cardboard. It is an ok book if you want something mindless and purely entertaining, just don't expect it to ""resonate"" with you and stay with you."
1,Drudgery,"After hearing all the hype about this book, I finally decided to try it for myself. And now I really don't understand why this book got (and continues to get) so much attention.I never knew that I could actually get sick of cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter...until I read this book. The chapters are very, very short. And there are lots of them. The writing style is that of an eighth-grader. It is simplistic and tells more than shows. It does all those things you were taught to avoid doing in order to write well. I've read many, many outstanding books that have never gotten the kind of hype ""The Da Vinci Code"" has, which is sad.This is clear evidence of the adage that ""best-selling"" does not necessarily equate to ""best written."""
1,You might like this book if...,"1. You mourn the loss of the overuse of adjectives in modern writing.2. Your B.S. detector needs new batteries.3. You have a lifetime subscription to The Star, The Globe, etc.4. You have gleaned all of your knowledge about early Christian history from the internet.5. You were a Druid in a past life.6. You have spent more than 2 hours of your life playing records backwards.7. You were born yesterday and or just fell off a turnip truck.8. You think a plot just gets in the way of good propaganda.9. You have the ability to suspend any shred of skepticism.10. Your idea of great literature is anything by Carolyn Keene."
1,Waste of time and money,"I am a PhD in philosophy, well-acquainted with art and ecclesiastical history, literature and theology. The plot is foolish, it is weak and contrived, and the characters are cartoons. Any soi-disant 'research' done in preparation for writing this book could've been better accomplished though Classics Comics. Theological inconsistencies abound, such as a root question: why might such a preposterous ruse ever have been initiated in the first place? I noted that Brown refers to Leonardo as 'DaVinci,' a nomenclature never used by art historians, who refer to him as 'Leonardo.' The representation of Opus Dei was patently fabricated ab ovo, bearing no relation to the real entity; this is the case whether one loves or loathes the prelature in question. As is also the case with his other work, Brown is at it again making a fast dollar from a gullible and uncultivated public."
1,"Connections, connections and more connections","For a work that has had such great reviews and is doing so well on the lists, I must confess that I am most disapointed with it.It is really not a good novel.All it proves is that with connections even the worst manuscript can be published and become a movie. With loads of publicity it can become a best seller.The author claims everything in his work is based on fact. (The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were also described in the same light). The fact is that everything in this work has been completely debunked.This like D.W. Griffith's movie Birth of a Nation is a work of fiction. A very pathetic work at that.If it goes down in history, it will be like Birth of a Nation for insights into the self styled 'creative class' than as a work of literature."
1,christian?,"This book should NOT be in the ""Christian"" category. I could not be any farther away from Christianity than any other book I know. It breeds doubt in the truth of what Jesus did for us. Please remove it from this category."
1,not a fan,The single star that I give this book is for the action and adventure in the beginning which I liked. The reason that is the only star has to do with the boring made up descriptions about the Holy Grail that makes up the last two thirds of the book. It's just too much reaching and grasping for me.
4,"Not entirely accurate, but an entertaining page turner.","""The Da Vinci"" code has been much critisized for its lacking accuracy of supposed historical facts. Regardless of how many of the book's claims are true, Brown makes one important point: There's always two sides to a story and the history books are written by the winners. Keep in mind: Don't assume everything someone says is true, be it the Catholic Church or Dan Brown. Check both sides, do some research. Don't automatically assume this book to be true, but it might inspire you to question some supposed facts of Christian history.This is not the first time a fictional work claims to be based on fact and whether Dan Brown truly believes in the Priory of Sion - which has been revealed to be a hoax - is not really important. As long as you read this book as a thriller, it is definately an entertaining page turner, well worth reading."
5,Fantastic Fiction,"This is a great work of fiction and was delightful to read. It can open your thoughts to another aspect of how to look at the subject matter of the story. The settings are richly presented, the writing flows, and the story moves at a good pace. Do not select this book and expect historical facts in every aspect. It is a work of fiction based on some historical fact. Dan Brown is an excellent writer and presents his view in a spellbinding story. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and shouldn't be missed."
4,A Thrilling Read from Start to Finish,"In his breakthrough novel, Dan Brown re-introduces the reader to Robert Langdon, an expert from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Brown stays true to form in this gripping read - you won't want to put this book down! ""The Da Vinci Code"" is full of rapid-fire surprises that are likely to leave one breathless, as the crew risks their lives in search of the Holy Grail. Brown's remarkably surrealistic work of fiction is literally teeming with fascinating anecdotes - which leave the reader shocked, stunned, and enthralled.http://www.stephenhehn.com"
1,Check your brain at the door as Mr. Brown re-writes history,"Mr. Brown and the publisher have made an obscene amount of money by presenting a fantasy novel as an historically accurate, ""exhaustively researched"", and credible piece of fiction to the detriment of the reputations of others. They have perpetrated a grave injustice that is an affront to the intelligence of the reader. They should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Poor plotting plus author's bias equals bad book,"The Da Vinci Code is suffused with bias against Christiantiy and the Catholic Church, in particular. The author's plotting is contrived and ridiculous; the ending is particularly weak. Too bad, because the potential was there for an interesting story."
4,Food For Inquisitive Minds,"The aspect of the novel that I found to be the most interesting was that it brought up a very unique interpretation of religous history. Immediatly after reading the book, I wanted to research some of the more esoteric points of the novel myself. The story is fairly clever. So clever, in fact, that I was somewhat dissapointed by the ending because Dan Brown's writing made me expect something more interesting. Overall, I would suggest that someone read this novel if he has an interest in history or will enjoy a read that might be somewhat educational. However, I did not find myself greatly entertained at any point of the novel. My interest peaked at several points in the story, but I quickly lost interest at other points. My general impression is that book merits 4 to 4.5 stars."
2,Loved It! Liked It!!! Hated It!!!!,"This book had such possibilities, but fell terribly short of achieving them! I'm running somewhere inbetween the person who gave it rave reviews and the gosh-awful trash-reviews. It's true, the very clever people in this book couldn't solve most of the clues fast enough for me (who in the world couldn't tell the one clue was written backwards -- come on!!!) This book was so interesting at times, I actually took notes - and so painfully boring at others, I had to force myself time after time to pick it up again just to finish it. Wish I'd stopped about 2/3 of the way through - my opinion and enjoyment factor would've been a lot higher! What a bunch of bunk at the end!!! For those who swallowed the bait Brown was dishing out - -here's some interesting info: Rearrange the letters in ELVIS and you will see LIVES - - therefore ELVIS LIVES!! It's a miracle!!!"
5,It Will Blow Your Mind,"Finally! A GOOD book! I haven't read anything this good in a long time. Dan Brown is a genius. He is able to write a thriller/history channel/Harry-Potter-can't-put-it-down suspense novel with seemingly unconnected facts that somehow, all manage to come together in the end for a truly astounding work of art. You'll walk away from this book a seemingly more intelligent and learned person. I read the whole darn thing in one day, I couldn't put it down! So, if you haven't already, GET THIS BOOK! AMAZING, WONDERFUL, B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
5,The best book I've ever read,"This book was AMAZING! I finished it in only a couple of days (I'm an active college student) and I wanted to read it all over again! This book was so thrilling, and what a page turner! It also makes me rethink the way I look at modern symbols now, and has really turned me on to cryptology and art history."
5,"Mary Magdalene, the wife of the Messiah","An excellent book - I could hardly put it down. It's sinful that mainstream Christianity has demonized Mary Magdalene, the wife of Jesus Christ the Messiah. Mr. Brown reveals the truth to a broad audience.Thank God for this fine book!!"
5,A Great Thriller and History Lesson,"I learned more about history (both political and religous) in the Da Vinci Code than I did in high school.The book is a page turner, from the first word on the first page to the last word on the last page. Brown keeps the chapters short and intriguing, making this an easy read, even for those who do not read regularly.Highly recommended."
5,unexpected and intelligent,"With apologies to Seabiscuit, this may be the best read of the past year. Dan Brown exhibits a dramatic flair for the ""intelligent mystery"". The best thing about this book and it's author is that the dialogue or science is never ""dumbed down"" for the audience. The highly original premise of this book, when combined with factual groups and real locations, makes for a very compelling read. If you liked this book, you should check out the authors prior work Angel & Demons."
4,Enlightening,"It seems that many of the reviewers were reading a different book. Anybody with a pulse will find this book exciting. It seems that the people who did not enjoy this book were determined to dislike its content for personal reasons. Brown offers controversial historical facts that are intertwined with a compelling mystery. In addition, in the opinion of some of the literary snobs on this site, authors are not supposed to produce anything that appeals to the masses. What a load of C***. Wake up! Reading is for pleasure and in this case Brown provides exactly that. An easy, informative and enjoyable read. Lighten up and go with the story. Not everything needs to be ""War and Peace""."
5,Excellent Book,I thought DaVinci Code was one of the best books I have ever read. Having been raised Catholic and always having questioned womens role in the church I thought this book brought an excellent perspective to the doubts I have had since I can remember.
3,Indiana Jones meets Tim LaHaye,"In this book all the players are ""bad guys."" The troubling thing is that it makes you pull for one set of these bad guys as though they were ""good guys."" Otherwise fun to read and full of interesting historical data. HOWEVER....the book IS fiction. Don't let it mess with your faith."
5,Great book,Its a page turner. you won't put it down. It will make you want to read more books on scandals of the Catholic Church.
4,Pass it along,"this is a surpisingly easy book to read in spite of it's heady material. It is very easy to get onboard w/ Brown's premise particularly if you do a little digging of your own and it is about time bibilical, art and religous history are given more than ""mueseum"" treatment. Pass it along to others, it is a boolk that begs to be discussed."
3,"Riveting story, not so the writing","A riveting story and fascinating information about the Knights Templar, the Priory of Scion, Agnus Dei, and the Holy Grail. Some fun as you attempt to solve the puzzle clues along with the protagonists. But character development is mostly nonexistent, and the overuse of certain sentence structures (e.g., ""Shedding his own suit coat and tie,"" ""Reconsidering,"" and ""Returning to the truck,"" - all in the same paragraph) eventually starts to grate. Just sloppy writing, and apparently sloppy editing, which unfortunately can distract the reader."
1,Lame,"I own the book. Bought it 3 months after it was released thanks to the extreme media fervour. It seemed this one the book that did no wrong.. the perfect book.. plot-wise, fantasticlly merging fact with fiction. And supposedly based on true facts!In reality the book couldn't -despite my best efforts- keep me engrossed past the 100th page. The so-called facts are completely conspiracy based and left me feeling hollow- like I'd taken a big bite of air.I really do not understand the interest it generated. Was it because it 'claimed' to be based on factual dark secrets of the Catholic Church?If there was a 1/2 star rating, I'd have given it that."
1,Not worth reading,"This book is poorly written and definitely not worth the time. Also, the ideas in it are just plain crazy, it is apparent that the author is relying solely on his far out ideas to carry this book, probably because he can't write. It is hard to believe that this book is a best seller."
5,A Suspenseful masterpiece,Bravo! Dan Brown has written a break out novel that deserves every word of praise that is being heaped upon it.This is an exrtaordinary page turner.
2,"Good, Interesting, Not accurate","That's about it. There are too many other reviews here for me to feel it necessary to continue. I liked the book, its quite interesting and well written. I'm an academic student of religious history, and his connections are liberal and speculative yet presented as fact."
2,You Must Be Kidding,THIS is the book everyone's talking about? You're kidding me. I've read at least a dozen mystery/thrillers this year better than THE DA VINCI CODE. The plot - about a religious sect seeking to keep an ancient secret hidden - comes right out of a Saturday morning cartoon. And the characters are about as believable as an honest politician. I saw where the story was going from the first couple of chapters - most intelligent readers will too. It just goes to show you that popularity isn't everything.Antelope Jones
1,Disappointing!,"Such profound material . . I was wondering how he would end it and as far as I am concerned, he was wondering too. For all the puzzle-solving, intellectual highballing that he puts into his characters, at the end, nothing. It was a page turner, and I only wish there was something of substance as I turned to the last page."
3,Interesting and enjoyable,"Interesting and enjoyable if you have a taste for historical mystery and drama. Read it straight thru until 3am which is a good sign - I didn't want to put it down. Reminded me of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum (which was way too long).And to R. Posey from New York, WTF? Anyone who writes a 5 paragraph review about a book they did not like - including this nonsense: ""How did it cross the equinoctial border that divides summer reading from autumnal brooding?"" probably shouldn't be ripping on the writing skills of a best selling author."
5,Get the Illustrated Version!,"This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time! If you're in to mysteries and conspiracies, this book is perfect for you! I highly recommend the illustrated version of this book, because much of the story relates to hidden messages and symbols in famous works of art...unless you're an art history buff, you'll probably want to see the symbols/messages for yourself, which are included only in this special illustrated edition."
5,Very entertaining and engrossing,"This book is very entertaining, with twists and turns at every page. Each chapter ends on a high note, promising more thrills to come, which makes it all the more harder to put it down. It is very addictive and this special edition, with the illustrations, simply brings the story to life. All the references to art and religious history make the story richer and more compelling. All in all, a great summer read. Highly recommended."
3,Fascinating topic; predictable story,"The topic of this book was new to me, but I found it absolutely fascinating and eye-opening (the only reason for the 3 stars)! I immediately went out and bought some informational books on the Priory of Scion and the premise of the Holy Grail. If this book had been about some other fictional topic, I would have put it down after the first few pages. The murder mystery plot was predictable and the ""leave-you-hanging"" endings to every chapter got old quickly (especially with the large number of chapters in this book). The speed at which this fast-paced mystery and its cryptographic puzzles was solved was completely unbelievable and, quite frankly, insulting. Admittedly, I did find the Epilogue alittle surprising, but nothing else caught me offguard. I'm not one for reading murder mysteries, but because this came so highly recommended by many, I did. Now I've confirmed for myself why I won't be reading anymore."
2,A real yawner,"The story started out well enough, with the plot unfolding at a sufficiently fast pace for me to overlook the paper-thin characters and the rather clunky writing style. As, however, the story became increasingly predictable, the other flaws began to loom larger, and about halfway through I began to simply skim. Soon, even that became more trouble than it's worth, and now the book sits on an end table, about fify pages shy of completion.I will probably pick it up again after I read some of the more interesting books I got for Christmas, just to see if I really did guess the rest of the story.It's nice, I guess, to see somebody dissing Corporate Christianity, but other than that I really wonder what the big deal about this book is."
2,Looked forward to this book but it may be the worst-written,"book I have read this year. You can find several howlingly-bad sentences per page. The opening page is a great example of the train-wreck-bad overwriting that makes up Brown's ""style."" Brown is an absolutely abysmal writer and I am confident that most of you could write a superior treatment of his idea than he could.In a way, it's a shame because the ""transhistorical"" conspiracy and the info about Jesus and medieval secret societies he used as a prop was very interesting. I learned interesting things from the novel but, as a thriller afficionado, I could not believe how talentless a hack Brown is."
2,The Da Vinci Code,"Like others,this book was highly recommended to me. Although the subject matter was very interesting, the writing style left me wanting more. The characters were not fully developed and after a while, it became predictable. I felt as if the author was telling me everything, instead of letting me figure some things out on my own. After all the high praise, I was dissapointed."
2,Cookie cutter book,"Finally got around to reading this after years of being harassed by the locals. I really do not see the big deal.This is a work of Fiction but apparently people are taking this for fact. I am not interested in these types of ""thrillers"" to begin with so its really not fair to review it but if you are like me and had not read it because you wereA- Not interestedB-Could care less about Jewish Numerologythen dont bother to read it, save time and money and read something you think you might enjoy.( Hey, at least I didn't say I hated it)"
4,A high speed romp!,A high-speed romp that uses elements from history for the clues. This one was hard to put down. Found myself pulling out my old art history textbooks to look at details from paintings. Lots of fun - thumbs up on this one!
5,Shocking and Suspenseful,"Wow, I could not put this book down. It grabbed me right from the beginning. Although the storyline is controversial, I was not averse to hearing a new angle on the Holy Grail and the secret Da Vinci society. It's a shocking supposition about Christianity that has many people up in arms, especially after the ""20/20"" segment that recently aired regarding this book. Nevertheless, this is America - where you are free to speak, read, or write any story you want. True or not, this book is an exciting and suspenseful read. You don't have to believe in it to become absorbed by it. And you will. Enjoy!"
3,Intricate Mystery,"I was disappointed after all the hype. This seemed like a Robert Ludlum type of layered plot. It had some good mystery, and some exciting escape sequences as the hero and heroine connected and tried to evade capture while figuring out the mystery. However, it all seemed so contrived to me that I had a hard time accepting it, especially the religious underpinnings. If you aren't too critical, you might enjoy the adventure, the romance, and the mystery."
5,Was Mary Magdalen the Wife of Jesus?,Brown had me hooked. I could not put the book down although I had read it many years ago. The suspense and intrigue made the pages fly by. All the characters became real as I began to know them as real people. I began to believe the story. I was waiting and anticipating the finding of the ancient writings that proved the linage of Mary as the wife of Jesus. The Templars and Opus Dei members guarded the secret. The ending was completely unexpected. Now I want to see the movie again!
4,"passes the time on a long car trip, but Strongbad fans beware!","I bought the audio version of the book because it's 18 hours long and I had an 18 hour car trip to make. It definitely passed the time and was worth every penny, but I have to give it only 4 stars because of some picky things with the reader...He does a good job doing female voices and his narration is pretty good (except when he gets confused and does an accent during the narration parts) but his ""evil French guy"" accents (there are at least 3) sound EXACTLY like Strongbad. If you don't know who Strongbad is, then this won't bother you a bit. Also I can't decide if the albino monk comes off as a total idiot because of the reader or the writing. But I wanted to fast forward through his parts (except, heck, I had 18 hours to kill)."
3,"A GOOD READ, BUT.............","I agree with most readers that the book was a real page turner. However, most of the plot was predictable and the author should have spent more time in character development. My big disappointment was the end of the book. After 400 plus pages of build-up I felt let down by the weak ending. Mr. Brown should have spent another 50 pages developing a conclusion as exciting as the story."
1,bad writing and stolen background information,"I disliked this book so much I could hardly finish it.I read a lot of thrillers. This one I read when it came into the Dutch bookstores, before it was a hype.The information on which this book is based is from the book ""The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail"", which I read some twenty years ago. That was a very interesting book. Apart from that information, this thriller has a ridiculous plot, and not one interesting dialogue.So the real mystery to me is, why it became so sought after.Theo Bollerman - lover of thrillers"
4,Dan Brown's 4th and best book,"This mystery thriller doesn't disappoint as it examines how history might have been rewritten if certain historical events had played out differently. Multi-layered, the book takes readers on a trip through a puzzle that requires a different set of operating instructions for each of the levels. And here's the fun part: when you've finished the book, you can go further in the quest via a website!Superb."
4,A Pulp Page Turner,"I read ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" years ago, and liked it so much that I toured the Languedoc region of France, so I was very familiar with the theme of ""The Da Vinci Code"". I noticed that Jacques Sauniere shares the same surname as the priest of Rennes-le-Chateau---not a coincidence, I'm sure. Brown has written an engrossing novel, but his style is more pulp than poetic, and the characters, for all their collective expertise, are a bit slow on the uptake. That said, I really enjoyed the book, and it's nice to see the Goddess get her due on the New York Times Best Seller list."
1,No Text To Speech!,I'll leave the review of the content to the printed book. Disabling text to speech - thanks for the arbitrary limitation!
5,An Excellent Fact Based Account of Religious History,"From the first page to the last, this book is packed with documented facts everyone needs to know about. This book attempts to, with superb detail, let the world know the truth about our Christian religious history.Dan brings to the reader an exciting passage of experience into the realms of the esoteric.A must read for anyone in search of the truth!"
1,The Da Vinci Code--what a disappointment,"This book came HIGHLY recommended and that's the only reason I read it all the way through. Otherwise I would've stopped at least half way. To each their own, but I personally found it a waste of time."
1,Biggest piece of schlock I've ever read,"I feel violated having read the Da Vinci Code.It was not well written, had glaring historical inaccuracies, and predictable plot twists.The biggest question I have is why did an author attempting to bring attention to the goddess cult make the only female character incredibly stupid? She is blindly influenced by the male characters in an extremely pathetic manner."
4,"Good one, easy reading, good gift","This is a fun one, read it cover to cover in one weekend. It even kept me a wake very late..."
5,C'√©tait tr√®s magnifique!!!,"Anyone interested in a good book that will keep you reading from cover to cover must buy Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. Remember when you were a kid and books had pictures? With The Da Vinci Code, the pictures are written in text. Not too much description, but just enough to keep you reading. Just try and guess the ending!"
4,Must read,"Although, some people say that this book is for eight grader. But I think it is not bad for people like me, who english is not so good. My sister's boss recommended to my sister and my sister recommended to me. They all love this book.I went to the author website, and I found out something very interest. The painting ""The last supper"" that Peter was grapped the wrist of an extral hand which held a knife. And others whom were sitting next to peter, they were all facing the audience and their hand held up. The palm faced audience, Which seems like Leonardo wasn't painted an extral hand accidently.There are many different religions out there, each include their own culture and myth. Each claimed, they have their own creator for the world. Which one we suppose to believe? If there are really god out there. He supposed to stop the tragic of 9/11 or the earthquake."
3,Wish there were more resources and facts to support this...,I originally read this because I was on a dating site and every single person seemed to have read it...so I checked it out. If this was really a religion...I'd be religious. This is a great read and it made me want to learn more about a lot of different topics. I wish there were more references and resources listed in back to follow up regarding some of the crazy stuff that sounds so real.
3,please not another screen play,I HATE the way this book jumps from sceen to sceen every two or three pages. It really breaks up the continuity of the narrative. I am sick and tired of reading books that were obviously written as a screen play.I wish the autor had just picked a point of view and stuck with it. I found the book very tough going. Every time I would become involved in the story he would kill my interest by jumping to a different character's point of view.
2,Silly history. Not his best,"As a fan I was confused by the history which in an interview he actually seems to take seriously. He is no historian. As a fan, I would exit ecccentric materials based on little, and do what he can do well."
4,Something you should know first!,"As every other reviewer will tell you, the Da Vinci code was an amazing story. As other reviewers will attest, if you like a good detective story where anybody can be the villian, this is a great book.But there was an issue I had with the book which, while not ruining the book for me, it could catch you by surprise and should be pointed out before reading this. The thing is, the story strongly goes against Christianity and in order to follow the investigation of the book, you have to make some assumptions that what you learned in sunday school was wrong. I'm not saying don't buy the book (I did give it four stars) but at least be aware that you may have to deal with it as you read it. That aside, enjoy!"
1,Dismal research ruins the ride,"An easy read that pulls you in from the start. I really wanted to like this book, but my intellectual integrity wouldn't let me. This is the most poorly researched book I have ever read. It is riddled with basic factual errors, geographical errors, art history fallacies, and historical inaccurances, not to mention the absurdities concerning Christianity. It would have been so simple to cross-reference a few ideas, check a date or two, pick up a map of Paris, verify claims about events...I can't think of any reason for this embarrasing mess of mis-information. I strongly advise readers lacking a background in the arts to balance this read with research of your own, or critiques of this book highlighting the countless errors."
1,Decent story but shabby history,"Wow. I admit I actually enjoyed the story itself -- likable characters, lots of action, twists and turns.However, in retrospect, I did start to tire of all the plot twists. It's like Brown just wanted to keep shaking things up as if that was his entire goal of writing. It seems I see that more and more today -- that a book can't be suspenseful and linear, but has to just keep surprising us. Gives me whiplash, but it was a fun read.Bigger issue: the complete lack of historical accuracy for the underlying premises of the book was mind-numbing. I realize many readers would not even see this, but it's still disturbing, and for me it spoiled the book. It's really just an education tool promoting a modern twist on ancient Gnosticism and other trendy (in some circles) ideas packaged inside of a suspense novel. I say one star."
1,Miserable,"This book is miserable, poorly written, painful to read on multiple levels: science, cryptography, language, plot, characters, logic. As a friend put it, there are so many twists in the plot that the novel resembles a mix of Femme a la Resille and Drawing Hands."
2,Kindle Version,"I am not sure if I am the only person who encountered issues with the Kindle version, but there were many symbols and illustrations in the book that did not rendered properly for me on Kindle. I ended up having to borrow a physical copy to fully experience the story! Needless to say I was very disappointed that I paid money for something I ended up not even being able to use."
1,Mass Market Tripe,"Pardon me, but if this passes for ""literature"" then let's all welcome each other to the Dark Ages. Yes I know, Dan is laughing all the way to the bank and I understand how one can get rich hitting a cultural nerve, but in this case, the nerve is mass hysteria and cultural ignorance. Not least of all, it is painful to witness the public execution of the English language. I threw the book out after 50 pages. No, that's not quite true. I recycled it."
1,What a Croc of Poop,"Dan Brown's historically inaccurate, lies, and shameless promotion are disgusting.This is just rehash of Gnostic Garbage that has as much to do with Christianity as the Easter Bunny does with the Crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ.Please do not be led astray by this book or any other of the Gnostic garbage that seems to be everywhere these days. Your soul is a lot more important than this bunch of Charlatans trying to make money by promoting Gnostic lies, half truths and misrepresentations of proven Christian doctrine."
2,Garbage Masquerading as Fiction,"Come on, people! This is the masterpiece that's set the publishing world on its ear? The research is shoddy, the characters are totally flat, and the story limps along like a club footed cow. It would be impossible to put spoilers in this review, as the entire plot was as transparent as a Scooby Doo episode. The only amazing thing about this novel is the fact that so many people love it. Don't ask me why."
1,Trite drivel,"I will have to qualify this review by stating that I have only read the first five chapters. I would have read more, but Brown's writing style is so inane and uncreative, I couldn't stop laughing.Admittedly, it is quite difficult to refrain from snickering at such [paraphrased] gems like: ""He resembled Harrison Ford in a tweed jacket"". Of the almost infinite possibilities in which one can describe a person, the author chose this actor's visage.In my humble opinion, the novel is about par with ""See Spot Run"" or an English reading primer."
2,Don't buy it for a minute!,"If anyone believes that what they're reading in this book is truth, I would ask you to contact me, as I have some great swamp land in Arizona for sale. Virtually everything that Dan Brown claims is ""factual"" is so wrong it's ludicrous, and what he actually gets right you would have to say, ""So what?"" Read it as pure fiction, and it's merely in bad taste. Read it as ""truth"" and you've been conned by a great con artist who couldn't take the time to check his historical facts to see if they were actually true. The story is okay, but it is one long chase scene, and Dan Brown is clearly no Robert Ludlum. This book is great for those who like to be duped. If you'd prefer to read historical novels that are faithful to historical facts, pick up a book by Paul L. Maier. They are excellent! Forget this book. You can do better."
2,Liked the premise but...,"the actual story was predictible. The theories were interesting and somewhat thought provoking but the story itself was mediocre at best. The short chapters got very annoying after awhile and the constant cliffhangers at the end of all the chapters seemed like elementary writing. I was very excited to read this book, but then let down. At least it is a quick read so you don't waste a lot of your time!"
1,Good ideas but such poor writing!,"OK I finally gave into the hype and decided to read it. By the end of the first chapter it was obvious the writing had serious flaws. Clumsy sentences. Awkward writing. It is an interesting subject that is true. And these ancient historical conspiracies are facinating. But these are covered so much better in other books, several of which are mentioned in the ""recommended instead of"" section. I started reading a couple of them and the difference in the quality of the writing is quite striking. It is one thing to be a good researcher and another thing to be a good writer or novelist."
1,the second-worst novel I have ever read,"This books is one of the worst-written things I have ever read. The characters are cardboard, the prose is turgid, and he writes dialogue like George Lucas. He also has this bad habit of ending every chapter with a fake ""cliffhanger."" By the end of the book I was hoping something dire would happen to the main characters so the dratted thing would end already. Unfortunately, they live.I could have lived with the author's gross mischaracterization of church history and the nature of Christianity if he could have written his way out of a paper bag.The only reason I made myself finish this piece of tripe was to discuss it with people who were talking about it and have an informed opinion. Also, I had lots of free time.I advise you not to waste yours."
1,Exasperating someone else wrote; excruciating would be a better word,"This book was given to us for Christmas or I wouldn't have read it. To satisfy any curiosity I had about something that gave the Pope such a hissy fit he encouraged Catholics to read it by banning it, I'd rather have seen the movie. Wading through all that clunky text was every bit as bad as I expected. But clunky writing wasn't enough for Dan Brown, who felt obliged to assault his readers with a lot of misinformation (such as that The Last Supper is a fresco when it's actually a painting). Rather than go into lengthy criticism of the book, I'm pointing readers to an in-depth one by linguist Geoffrey K Pullum. The URL is http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000844.html and every point Mr Pullum makes is 100% valid."
2,Lacks imagination,"I typically don't read books that have been hyped up by the general public. A few of my friends, however, suggested that I check it out. So I did. While I don't regret reading it, I would never recommend it to anyone. Brown pretty much lost me when he described the main character as a ""bookish Harrison Ford"" that is a professor at an ivy league university. This character is about to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail... I saw that movie over 15 years ago... it's called ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The characters all lack depth, and the riddles were mindless (I solved the first one as soon as it was presented, and the second maybe a few pages before the characters did.) I'd never read another one of his books."
2,Slow and Cumbersome,"I had eagerly awaited the chance to read this book because of all the rave reviews I had heard about it. Unfortunately, the reality did not live up to the hype. While expecting a mystery thriller, what I got was mostly historical fiction.While the author seems to have done a lot of research into the history of the grail and secret societies, the mystery was poorly plotted and seemed to drag where it should be speeding along. Hot thriller? I'd say lukewarm at best. The first 150 pages were hard to get through, but I persevered. The story did pick up a little bit after that, but was so trite and predictable that I had it all figured out by page 200.What seems to fascinate everyone that reads the book is the ""history"" given- and some people actually seem to believe the premise given in the book to be real. (See other reviews.) However, this is a work of FICTION. There is just enough truth mixed in with the fiction to perhaps fool the masses, but any true Bible scholar knows better."
3,The Da Vinci Code,I found the subject matter of this book most interesting and fascinating but as a thriller I thought it was very average. In my view the book has been highly overrated
1,"Read ""Foucault's Pendulum"", rather than this pap....","If ""Da Vinci Code"" sounds interesting to you, you would be far better served by turning to Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"", which at least makes intellectual demands on the reader. It is indeed depressing when truly trivial books, as this one is, become best sellers."
1,Dan Browns body ...of work,"Mr. Brown is on a quest to defame the Catholic church. It seems to be his holy grail, so to speak. I suppose fact and thoughtful consideration would be too much of a stretch so he has resorted to attacks with little in the way of fact behind them that are meant to inspire paranoia. From the popularity of this book it would appear that much of the public is eating it up. It is oh so fashionable to pile on the Catholic church right now.Why? Even though that nasty business with the Crusades is far behind them, the church has much ""splainin"" to do with those mounting molestation charges.Mr. Brown has produced a flimsy, mediocre, opportunist, and mercenary novel. He is a genius in the same way that Madonna is a genius.The new-age definition for genius: Anyone who can sniff out a trend, exploit and capitalize on it with little regard for truth, artistic value, or the repercussions of their actions."
2,"Fun, but hardly great",I still can hardly believe this book sold as much as it did. Was it a fun read? Yes. Was it a great book? No. In the Name of the Rose (Umberto Eco) was a far superior book in the genre of religious suspense and secrets. Everyone should go back and read that -- but maybe it was too complex for most readers of light fiction.
2,Two stars for good spelling,"You don't need another review, do you? You just want to find out how I could give this fabulous book 2 stars. It has nothing to do with religion. I don't care about that. This book is stodgy and formulaic: every big, crashing, ""surprise"" is as predictable as the sunrise. I really did not look at the 5-star reviews: I wish I could get past lack of writing talent and let my imagination flower as do those of the people who loved this book. More power to 'em."
3,Great stuff!,"I love good fiction, and the Da Vinci code is just that. It brings up a lot of issues that most people are just too frigtened to look into. ONe of them is that, maybe, just maybe, Jesus was a human being who lived like a human being!I also like the idea of there being a conspiracy, since one of the best books on the subject of Christianity is ""The Christ Conspiracy,"" which I think everybody should read.Hey, it might not go so far as we'd like it to, but the Da Vinci Code is sure a start to findiung out the truth about religion.Wake up everybody!"
4,Great Story But......,"I loved the premise of the book. Secret soieties, clues hidden in world famous paintings, and some of the best-kept secrets of the world. This book is absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend it to all my friends. It is no wonder that it has stayed on the bestseller list.The only thing that I can find at fault with this book is the ending. It leaves the reader with the sense of, ""Wait, what just happened?""Other than that, I think this book is one of the best books of its time."
1,Madman,What a piece of anti-Catholic psycho-babble junk. The author attempts to fuse feminism and mysticism with a conspiracy run by the Vatican. My wife gave it to me for Father's Day and I worked my way through it hoping something interesting would happen. My sister then gave it to me for my birthday and I refused it. The writing is terrible. If this is what the popular novel has come to it is another sign that the apocalypse is upon us.
1,Lame and Disappointing,"I have never been so diasppointed with a book. Dan Brown basically takes a few religious theories (that have been around for quite a while and aren't obscure at all) and intertwines them with a lame plot. Don't waste your time reading this book. The fact that so many people like it and find it so earthshattering is only a sad testament to how pathetic, limited, and closed minded we have become."
3,Choose your own adventure,"Reads like Foucault's Pendulum Lite, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Half the obscurity, twice the readability, but somehow not as satisfying. If you're acquainted with ""conspiracy"" theory and/or history in any real sense this book will leave you feeling sort of embarassed that your once arcane knowledge will no longer shock people at parties. If, however, you're a total numbskull and have bought everything they've taught you over the years, then this makes a pretty good introduction to the world as it is, and you will probably reject it, because its truths unmask the lies you've accepted for so long."
2,Accurate? Well...,"Although the premise is intriguing, author Brown's prologue statement that, with few stated exceptions, all facts are accurate is somewhat misleading.I think that Brown's idea of ""accuracy"" is somewhat similar to the way Oliver Stone treated ""history"" in his film ""J.F.K.""If the reader is less interested in complete accuracy than an interesting story, this is a fine book. The characters are one-dimensional and, at times, the writing seems workmanlike. Nevertheless, the premise keeps the fires of this story stoked until the very last pages."
2,Dan Brown needs to get a thesaurus--Doesn't live up to the hype.,"I respect that fact the Dan Brown must have done research in order to write this book. He just doesn't seem to have that much of an imaginative vocabulary. I got tired of seeing the use of the same words and phases over and over. The book just doesn't live up to the hype, I don't understand the fuss over it."
2,"Crap, crap, crappity crap, crap","Ok, two stars for ideas and use of actual historical artifacts. However, in terms of being a good book, nothing. I hated having to wade through the 400-or-so pages of ""writing"" to get the scrapping of a good idea. I know 4th grader who write better. This book was/is popular only because of stupid religious fanatics and lazy readers who think that, if they get through 10 chapter in one sitting, it's a good read. It's crap. One of the few cases in which I would recommend the movie over the book, and that's not saying much. Read ""Marathon Man,"" more thrilling and much more satisfying."
5,"Compelling, powerful and thrilling!","This book was so compelling and the author made such good use of cliffhangers in each chapter that I simply couldn't put it down. I literally devoured this book in a few days. I looked forward to reading it in every free moment I had. The juxtaposition of light and dark are powerfully presented in this novel. The spiritual meaning of the Holy Grail was truly profound, and a great metaphor for the feminine foundation in spirituality. The controversy sparked by this novel speaks to its power and society's unyielding need to ignore the feminine and support the patriarchy."
1,Disappointing,"Probably the expectations were too high. The book came with rave reviews as being an intelligent religious thriller. It's probably intelligent, if you are seven years old. It starts off pretty well but then it is downhill all the way. Gaping holes in the plot, puerile puzzles, twists and cliches dampen any enthusiasm you may have. The characters are boring. Brown's enthusiasm in explaining concepts like the golden ratio is like that of a child who's just got a new toy and can't wait to show it off. While Brown insists on referring to his male characters by their last names, why he prefers to use the name Sophie and not Nevue is puzzling. All in all, you'd be better off re-reading Foucault's Pendulum."
3,Interesting read but predictable,"I very much enjoyed the premise of the book and loved the thought-provoking issues it touched on, but was somewhat disheartened by the claim that the book was one of the best mystery reads of the year. Brown sets up his two characters as figures of great intellectual authority (Sophie, cryptologist; Langdon, Harvard professor specializing in religious symbolism), but I found myself solving the novel's ""puzzles"" two or three pages ahead of the characters. I don't claim to know much about art history, grail legend, or goddess worship, but having rudimentary knowledge of Da Vinci's work, romance language, and church history should NOT allow a reader to out-reason characters set up to be experts. Nevertheless, I appreciate any author that attempts to disspell many of the conventions about religion, history, and humanity to which so many people so desparately cling."
1,bad bad bad,"I expected this book to be enjoyable light reading, and light reading it was. The iconography was sort of interesting, but could not overcome the implausible plot twists and the completely stupid revelation at the end. Oh yeah, and the protagonists hook up. Who woulda thunk it."
2,"Very entertaining, but also superficial and manipulative","The book was written to be turned into a movie and make the author a gizzilionaire. Did I have fun reading it? YES. It is fast paced, pseudo smart if you want to read something dumb and quite entertaining. Do I believe everything it says? No, definitely not all of it; it does put forward over due plausible arguments and hypotheses. But there are better authorities and more intelligent discussions. Do I recommend it? If you like to be entertained, definitely. It is like Eye of the needle, but it upsets the religious right! :-)"
1,What a boring book,"Dan Brown seemed to be on every bestseller list in the world so I decided to find out what was so great about his books. I read The Da Vinci Code and I surely don't know why so many people want to read this boring book. The thin plot is spread through pages and pages of copy/page like information out of ""more than you ever wanted to know about ... "" pamphlets. I could skip a good deal of the book and still know what happened.A good thriller is so tightly written that one doesn't want to miss a word. Dan Brown should read Frances Fyfield to find out about good thriller writing."
1,Swallowing Poison,"I generally use the Da Vinci code as a litmus test to weed out intelligent folk from the masses. Less than 30 pages into this trite, useless book that relies on sitcom hinges and the average person lack of historical knowledge, I wanted to stab my eyes out with a plastic spork.Even when borrowed from the library, you've paid too high a fine to read this trash."
3,Fun read,"A well written, well developed thriller. I just wish my fellow reviewers weren't so taken with Dan Brown's lies dealing with history & religion - he clearly did it to garner attention and sell books. Revisionist history - Ugh. BUT, if you can park that aside, it's the type of read that will eat your weekend up."
3,Predictably decent,"For a Follow-up to Angels and Demons, I felt dissappointed. This was a decent mystery that kept me relatively rivited, but i was able to put it down. Slightly predictable, followed some of the same plot points contained in Angels and Demons, but with characters that were not nearly as intriguing, and to a large degree were unbelievable.All and all though, it was a good storyline with well researched setting and references. Grade: C+"
2,A plot based on stolen research,"I love this subject, and so was excited at the prospect of this novel. However, to readers of the non-fiction books ""Holy Blood, Holy Grain"" and ""The Templar Revelation,"" there is absolutely new. Mr. Brown has taken other scholars' research and fashioned a not-so-innovative plot. In effect, he has taken credit for others' work. That, combined with his cheesy, manipulative suspense techniques (a cliffhanger at the end of every 2-page chapter) make this a disappointing read. Perhaps Mr. Brown should have just skipped the novel and went straight for the screenplay."
2,Umberto Eco for Dummies,"This was Umberto's ""Foucault's Pendulum"" light. There are stories of the Templars, ancient secrets protected over thousands of years, but there is no depth or weight. I would compare this book to reading the back flap of ""Lempriere's Dictionary"" by Norfolk, which is a much better read and would take about the same time too."
2,thriller lite,"On the whole, I thought it was pretty disappointing. Yes it had some (many - too many) close calls, fast chases, with dozens of stereotypical cliches fighting for room on the page. There was some imaginative connect-the-dots stream-of-consciousness plot development which was interesting for minutes at a time.My overall impression was that this was a starter mystery thriller for people who have never read a mystery thriller before. The heavily religious trappings probably lured in a whole group of people who were exposed for the first time to this kind novel. Hopefully it'll be a beginning for them, and they'll move on to the *good* authors."
1,World Best seller????,It is difficult for me to imagine how this book ever became a world renown best-seller. Ther is absolutely nothing in it which would be of interest to an average intelligent person. The so called sensation is hard to conceive and attempts to be inresting are too weak. I undesrtand that ther exist an either sequel or pre-quel? Good luck!
5,Best fiction I ever read....,"I never used to read fiction books/novels for pleasure. I had to force myself to read required books in college. Then one day, about two years ago, my wife borrowed this book from my brother. I decided to give it a try. I read it in 3 days. I could not put it down. I then proceeded to get Dan Brown's other three books and read them immediately. I now have a personal library collection and read novels every chance I get (Steve Berry, James Rollins, etc.). The story, the puzzles, the twists.....unbelievably well thought out. I am most impatiently awaiting his next novel. Thank you Dan."
3,Good plot but a great leack of accuracy,"This is a funny novel, with mistery, imagination, a good rithm, etc. But if you pretend having written a very well documented book... you cannot start with a earthquake in ...Andorra!!! That's unbeliveable!!! If all the suposed facts are as much accurate as this...Well, good fiction, but that's all!"
2,Jesus was married!?,"The book starts out GREAT! Then gets weird for people who are looking for a Christian thriller. Well writen, but the ending is just not up to the hype."
5,Fascinating!,"I had trouble staying with this book at first, but when I got into it, I could not put it down. I love the information presented about Leonardo Da Vinci - I now see him in a different light - and reading about the ""secret"" behind Mona Lisa's smile and some of his other religious paintings.This book presents some pretty startling answers to questions I have held for awhile about Christianity and the Catholic faith. It helped open my mind to some things while making others more clear to me. Although it is a work of fiction, there is much factual historical information contained in the book, which I found fascinating.Absolutely one of the best books I've read in a very good while!"
3,"Good, but I was expecting something more...","I will not deny that this was an engrossing read--I, like many other readers, was unable to put this book down. Nevertheless, I was somehow expecting something more. I don't really know what, but as fascinating as this story was, something fell short. Maybe it was that the villain wasn't very villanous (and indeed his aims were arguably admirable). Or maybe it was that the book wasn't long enough. The Da Vinci Code is the type of thriller with a masterful exposition that quickly fizzles into 200 pages of less-inspired but still intriguing writing. I don't know. But it's a good read, even if it isn't perfect."
2,A gallimaufrey of dunsical folly,"Exciting, I guess, and it made me want to finish, but it's ignorant and illiterate."
4,Just a question,"I read the paperback edition and I want to know if Dan Brown tells more in the illustrated edition before I spend money to buy it.Dan Brown was very clever in the paperback version to disclose in the end that Sophia Neveu was a direct descendant of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. I think Brown intentionally let the reader ponder upon a hidden clue; Sophia Neveu drank but never urinated to make her half God half human. Robert Langdon, too, he drank but never urinated once in the whole story. He got to be the Worthy to find the Grail.On page 448, Dan Brown wrote ""Then, leaning forward, she kissed him tenderly on the cheek.""And then there's no sex between the two?I had to go back to 4 pages to understand Dan Brown's hidden clue.Page 444, he wrote ""a full moon was rising above the tree line.""Ah, the connection between full moon and women's menstrual cycle. That was why Sophie kissed but did not make love to Robert.Anyway, I give 4 stars for 4 pages that I had to flip."
1,Real Junk,"This book is complete and utter nonsense. None of its ""history"" is correct. There is no profession of ""symbologist,"" for example. And that's not all the nonsense. The plot is transparent and predictable at every turn.All this could be fun, but it is written with pompous seriousness. In addition to inventing weird history (powerful secret societies, details of the search for the Holy Grail), the book misinforms about or hypes up essentially every real subject it touches.My aching back! On the best seller list yet!"
1,For tru-fans only,The novel was a badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller. This illustrated edition is an expensive and attractive badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller.For tru-fans only.
2,"Enjoy it, just don't read to much into it.","THe first time I read this book, I enjoyed it. Kudos to encluding the illustrations.The secind time I read it I HATED IT.He's got talent as a writer, I'll admitt. But when I REALLY read it and took in all the ""evidence"" that was presented, I kept thinking . . . ""Well, what does that prove?"" So you really can't read this book with a mind towards the facts. They've all been manipulated to tell a good story.Read it with a grain of salt. Its all in fun."
4,Great,"Great...a replacement for the one I lost. Just as promised, fast delivery. Would do business again with this seller. Thanks!"
1,IT'S ALL FAKE!!!!!!,Nothing in this book is true (hence fictional). If you want something with DaVinvi's name on it try looking in an art history book. it's just a whole load of crap. don't bother spending all that money - because (like me) it will just piss you off and for all the uneducated beings - they will beleive what they read and think they are smart and start passing off false information...
5,Still Thinking about it--weeks later!!,This is the best book I've read since Angela's Ashes. I totally recommend it.
2,Da Vinci Code - over-hyped and over here!,"The Da Vinci code is undoubtedly a page turner and contains some interesting (though not new) material on Mary Magdalen and the sacred feminine. However, it is extraordinarily badly written with some very cliched characterisation - upper-class villainous Brit - how very Hollywood! A green eyed red haired heroine - how often has she been done? Some good editing, preferably from a non-American would have been helpful. I'm sure no Frenchman would regard the Eiffel tower as the symbol of France - Marianne fulfills that role. And since when has anyone English said 'I'm truly sorry for your loss'. Lastly, scholarly English librarians simply would not indulge in tactless banter with an esteemed American researcher over the wisdom of knighting Rudi Giuliani. Was Dan Brown trying to make a post 9/11 point? Buy this book for its silly frenetic plot and intriguing artistic insights but don't expect great literature."
4,"Collection item for the bookshelf, not for reading pleasure","I purchased the Special Illustrated Edition thinking that I will be able to enjoy the most comprehensive reading experience. The book arrived as everything I expected: Beautiful hard cover, color pages, and large, comfortable fonts to read. But there is also something I did not expect: It is so heavy, that I was not able to hold it with one hand.This is undoubtedly a good book (hence the 4 star rating), but it weights very uncomfortably on my lap if it stays for a prolonged period of time. So the conclusion is, if you really wanted to read the book, I recommend that you stay with the paperback. For those who would like to have The Encyclopedia of the Da Vinci code, you can consider buying this version to decorate your bookshelf."
2,"Fascinating premise, mediocre execution","This novel has generated a lot of interest because of its fascinating premise, but at its core, it's a fairly mediocre piece of fluff literature. For those truly interested in the theological and philosophical questions surrounding the book's central mystery, there are far better sources of information available. It's not bad; it's entertaining in a quick, light, fluffy kind of way, but it's ultimately disappointing in that the subject matter deserved a better novel.But what annoyed me most of all was the hero's name: Robert Langdon. It just <i>sounds</i> like the name of a hero in a fluffy mystery novel. Surely Mr. Brown could have come up with something a bit less trite."
1,Poorly designed,"The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating book, but the illustrated edition is a bit of a travesty. Black text, white paper, Roman serif font, justified text: this edition does not evoke the imaginative world of Dan Brown. It is essentially the same as the black and white edition, with a few color pictures added here and there.A far more satisfying illustrated edition would have evoked the manuscripts of the era of which Brown writes. The illustrations and designs could have invited us into Brown's mind and touched us emotionally.The mere fact that the publisher produced an illustrated edition is part of a growing body of evidence that the public wants beautifully designed books. The current number one best selling book is America: the Book, printed in full color, and the number one Bible of 2003, Revolve, was also printed in full color.Valerie Kirschenbaumauthor of Goodbye Gutenberg: How a Bronx Teacher Defied 500 Years of Tradition and Launched an Astonishing Renaissance"
4,Dare to know,"This book is good. It is good because it amuse you. It is good because it teach you (or at least it challenges you to investigate and learn in the process), and it is good because it has a good story in it. This book is not a nobel prize, it is a novel, just that. But be careful, if you are a devoted christian, a strict catholic practicant or a religious fanatic, this may not be for you."
3,"Great first half, good historical conjectures, bad ending!","I found the first half of this book really interesting and catchy; even the ""historical"" data is very interesting (I looked at the last supper, and indeed there is a woman sitting to the right of jesuschrist). Even with the new research on the historical persona of Christ (he never really existed but his life is a series of compilations from other religions), it is interesting to read how he was seen by freethinkers of other ages.However once the fact throwing stops and the characters start changing sides the plot turns into a ""hollywoodlike thriller"" and you almost want to put the book down."
1,best book you ever read??,"I suppose if you have read 2 books in your life, one was the Da Vinci Code and the other one was, I dunno, let's say Nancy Drew and the Hidden Decoder Ring, well then I guess DVC might be the best book that you have ever read.Sorry to sound so condescending, but Dan Brown started it. The Da Vinci Code is juvenile level writing. At least Carolyn Keene never pretended to be anything more than pure pulp entertainment for the preteen set.If you are under the age of 13 or have nostagia for the days when a good mystery required minimal brain effort, then this Code's for you."
3,"Kept my interest, but ......","This book is an exciting read, but the ending was so disappointing that it took away from its promise. At the end, all of the puzzles and games to figure things out seem nothing but stupid. I enjoyed Defenders of the Holy Grail, another novel with similiar themes, much more."
3,Eco 101,"Although I couldn't put the book down till I'd finished it, I can't quite say that it was all that great. For starters, there's just so many ideas which have blatantly been ripped out of Foucault's Pendulum (and some Baudolino) - the paris museum, templar knights, hidden secret which everyone's searching for... Seems to be somewhat of a toned down Eco for the intellectual proletariat!"
2,"Clever, but","The book has a clever premise, but it is predictable (I figured out almost every ""surprise"" before it was revealed, and if I can do it, it must not be very surprising)and not that well written. How many times in one book can you interrupt the revelation of an important piece of information for the sake of ""suspense""? It got routine and boring after a while. Also, the characters were flat - you never really got to know who they were, but then again, I never really cared, either."
2,Disgrace as a novel,"Yes this book is a good read. In fact it is a page turner. However, the character development in this book isn't very good. Also,Mr.Dan Crown seems to be a little too preoccupied with ""Divine Feminine"" when writing this novel. The firstt half of the book was good, but then later it seems like If the author just wanted to prove his point, going to desperate measures. Even though this is a work of fiction, I believe that authors shouldn't abuse facts in their books. Many of my favorite authors, Clive Cussler, Ken Follett, don't use truthful facts in their books and they are still exciting. Even though I am not a Christian, I believe that slandering anothers religion in a novel is not a nice thing to do. Even, though there may be some truth in this book, read it for the suspense, but don't believe anything in the book."
1,"Painful writing style, painfully dense characters","Could Dan Brown use more adjectives? I thought I would throw the book across the room if he used ""famous"" one more time. His writing style read more like a freshman college student's first attempt at creative writing than an author published several times over.The only intriguing part of the novel was the historical description of the Holy Grail mystery. The ""suspense"" part of the book was so transparent, I was many steps beyond the purportedly brilliant scholars every inch of the way. I found this book very difficult to continue to read, but was forced to only because it was a selection for our book club. I wouldn't read another of his books."
2,Dense and disappointing,"There's far too much math, codes and cryptology, art history, and religious history in this book, and far too little thriller. The writing is pedestrian, and the characterization is nil. That said, the premise is very intriguing -- but unfortunately the first review, above, gives away the big secret! So you lose that suspense -- you already know what they're going to find out. So I'm mixed about this novel. The author is clearly smart, and it's original, but it doesn't really live up to the hype."
2,Mediocre?,"Davinci Code didn't live up to the hype, at least not for me. If I hadn't been expecting so much maybe would have been 3 stars."
2,STRANGE?,"If it didn't waste so many words and so much of the readers time this book might be tolerable. The author should cut to the chase, give the reader a more rounded story and quit wasting the readers time. If someone, that could read, wanted to find out what this author makes an effort toward, they should get the book called ""MEET MARK TWAIN"""
3,"A quick read, but not great literature.","Fast paced, pulpy, and fun. Like the river at the end of City Slickers, ""it's fast, but it's not deep."""
5,"It about faith, pure and simple.","The Angel HunterAnyone who finds this book offensive to their Christian faith has missed the brilliance of the entire novel. Robert Langdon admits when he was a boy-drowning in a well-that is was Jesus who came and gave him the strength to tread water all night until he was found. It was in this moment of intense need and desperation that faith empowered Robert. Why does anything else need to be said or any other prose critiqued concerning the credibility of Dan Brown as a writer or a man of faith? The strongest case that he makes, through the experience of his character, is missed by the naysayers and so called faithful. Read the book for the subtle and deep value Dan Brown puts on faith, not dogma, not theocracy, and not belief systems that tumble when challenged with logic. Jesus: mortal or divine, myth or man, was there when young Robert needed him. That's all any of us need isn't it?"
2,Would make a much better Hollywood movie,"I didn't see the movie, but this book is written and begs to be turned into a Hollywood blockbluster. Don't expect to read a great piece of literature here. It's entertaining in a cheesy way. Characters are like cartoon characters - they don't seem like real people.If you are looking for a ""light"" read perhaps on your next vacation then you probably will not be disappointed. It is fast paced fluff if that is what you're looking for. It has little educational value. If you just want to keep up with pop culture (which is why I forced myself to read it) then consider watching the movie - it will take less time."
1,Influence away from God,"This book is full of falsehoods. Anyone who has read the Bible knows that. Jesus did not marry. He was without any sin. I believe that this novel--even though it is fiction to an extent--is influencing the readers against God. That is something this nation cannot afford. If we turn from God, who will save us when we are in danger of falling?I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"All hype, no filler","This book is absolutely atrocious. Disregarding all the historical inaccuracies and pretending it is simply a fiction novel, (a novel idea, right?) the characters in this book are boring and stereotypical, the puzzles are less than intriguing, and the writing style could best be described as ""a submission for 9th grade creative writing class.""I literally hated this book and everything about it. The only reason it has done so well is because people can't learn to leave well-enough alone. If the Catholic Church had said to themselves, ""This book sucks, let's ignore it"" then Dan Brown would still be languishing in obscurity. But that's beside the point I suppose. Anyway, if you haven't read this (and you are certainly in the minority) don't waste your time. Go read something worthwhile."
1,The fires of scandal caught on to Sony batteries,"Brown wrote the stump, Sony filmed the fiasco, fiery Sony batteries have to be recalled like Hell... Where's the connection?"
1,A Major Let-Down,"All I can say after this reading is...BLAH! I am truly shocked that SO many people liked this book. Maybe it's because so many had never heard of any of the concepts Brown introduces. I think he's one of those know it all sort of people who has a definite agenda to push. For this guy, it's goddess worship. Read any interview of him regarding this novel and you will know the truth of my words.If you must read it, please don't waste your money- borrow it from your public library."
2,"DaVinci Code, What has Brown done for you lately?","It seems as though there are no middle of the road reviews on Dan Brown's DaVinci's Code. Either they are wildly euthusiastic or a complete pan. The story's premise has an interesting hook that grabs almost anyone (Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene) but, delivers it with such lameness that the reader becomes annoyed. Not even the fast facts nor the historical trivia can keep you from noticing the all too convenient discoveries and formula type writing. For example the multiple uses of the second look at any situation yielding much more information than the first. I would imagine this is to create suspense or intrique. It accomplishes nothing when used twenty times in the book. We end up wishing the main characters would purchase a pair of dime store bifocals to see what is patently obvious to the reader. All in all I was left on completion of the book with the feeling of how good it could have been."
1,Over-rated and poorly written,"The DaVinci Code has a compelling premise but an uninspired delivery. I wonder why fans of this book don't realize how poorly written it is.Dan Brown has the same problem as his counterparts on the opposite side of the religious spectrum who write the Left Behind series -- lazy writing. Brown's characters have nothing memorable to offer. The villains are simply implausible, (a common enough problem in many current thrillers) and the violence is graphic and contrived. There are too many overtly clever riddles, the time line is ridiculous and Brown's descriptions lack impact of any kind.I do admit that I found Brown's biblical arguments interesting, which is really the only reason to read this book."
1,Lame,"A little warmed over pseudohistory from the Discovery Channel, cardboard characters, and writing so amateurish it is painful to read: this is The Da Vinci Code. I hated this book. I only finished it because it was a Christmas present.About halfway through I began to skim. I finished the last 100 pages in a half hour. That's about as much time as I think it's worth. Oh well, it was on sale and I can probably sell it to somebody else. I picked up another of Dan Brown's book, read the first page, and it was as badly written as this one was. That's all for me! I can bear no more."
1,"If You Read ""Angels And Demons"", Skip This One.","I won't even go into the historical or theological inaccuracies of this hack piece of work. What I will tell you is that this ""novel"" is his previous work, ""Angels And Demons"", just with different character names.The beginning involves the murder of a prominent intellectual figure by a secret society. The book's main character, Robert Langdon, a Harvard Sybologist (semioticist?) is yet again brought in to assist on the esoteric clues left behind.We have Langdon yet again thrown in with a female character who is related to the murder victim. He has to deal once more with thick-headed law officials possessing no imagination. Once more there is a race against time...Reading this book was a bad case of deja vu!Mr. Brown, please think of a different plot and more complex characters for your next novel. Also (most importantly), do better research if you're going to continue doing these so-called ""religious/conspiro"" thrillers."
2,"Predictable, and the ""research"" at times is laughable","OK, let's see, I figured out the identity of the Teacher fairly quickly, solved all the riddles almost immediately (except in cases where key information was withheld), I knew the 10 digit account number well before the characters found it, realized immediately where the grail was, who sophia was, etc.The history of the grail was pretty pathetic. Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum covered much of the same ground much more creditably and didn't rely on as absurd of a conspiracy to make it all come together. The crediting, for example, of the biblical canon to Constantine was rather laughable, as anyone who has studied the history of the biblical canon would agree.If you thought this was a good book, do yourself a favor. Get Foucault's Pendulum and read the story done right."
1,Cypher This,"What a disappointment. Brown's story starts out well enough, a murder in a museum, a secret religious society and couple of relatively attractive characters thrown together in a break-neck paced plot. So what went wrong? Just about everything. By the end of this book I found myself screaming - Get on with it!!! What's the point of so many cryptic references - it felt like I was working my way through a puzzle book. Brown tries so hard to impress us with the ""mystery"" of the Holy Grail and his pseudo-religious plotline that he forgets to tell the story."
2,This is literature?,"I'm not impressed at all. This is mediocre suspense writing at best. The constant and often totally unbelievable cryptographic meanings hidden in paintings, poems, and architecture became very tiresome and, after 500 pages, it seemed the author had gone off the deep end, 'round the bend, and to the funny farm...and he never looked back. I wish I'd just seen the movie; it reportedly sucked too, but it would've saved me time. It gets two stars only because he successfully hoodwinked the American public."
2,Grail Quest Eventually Grates,"This story began with great promise. It appeared to be a non-stop type of novel. About midway, however, it became clear that the author had a personal agenda to pitch. When the plot ultimately degraded into a ""car chase"" I actually put it away for a month or so. I finally finished reading the book this morning, and the ending is clearly designed for a B-Rated Hollywood film (Hmmm, maybe Richard Gere could play the lead role.) This book went from great to a grating disappointment!"
3,"Good for Beginners, but...","Despite its reputation, Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code rates no more than a 3. On the whole a captivating read, the book suffers from poor structure and historical inaccuracy. Worst of all, the same ideas were captured in a much richer, intriguing, and complex book, Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum."" Alas, Brown has re-hashed ideas that tantalize the uninformed but disappoint the more literate.Instead of reading this Clif Notes version of Western Civilization, I suggest you read ""Pendulum"" or study Da Vinci himself. Then, judge for yourself if Christianity is sitting on a secret, or whether instead the secret is really inside ourselves.Note: mainstream Christians, especially Catholics, may find ""Code"" offensive or even blasphemous. Since I am Jewish, I lack the personal, cultural, and educational background to judge; you should proceed with caution."
2,Oops--I believed all the hype!,"Well, I finally gave in and read this book for one of my book clubs, and was extremely disappointed. It was a ridiculous Hollywood script from beginning to end!The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did ignite one of the most interesting discussions I've had in a book club. But in the end, we all agreed that the book came nowhere near to living up to the hype!"
1,Beach Book,"If you have the least knowledge of the history of Christianity, gnosticism, or for that matter, Leonardo da Vinci's quirks, you're going to be guessing each puzzle at least three pages before the hero does.It's okay to pass the time on an airplane, but intellectual or challenging it is not!"
3,Recycled Concepts,"If I hadn't read The Golden Fleece Found by Basil Hill first, I might have found Dan Brown's book more interesting. However, having been left hanging and wanting more from the Celestine Prophecies, I needed not just another book of vague riddles, but more meat. The two books are complete opposites. Dan Brown uses myths and allegorical riddles, Basil Hill gives codes from Solomon's Temple, Hebrew Codices and juicy stuff after which the esoteric community have been searching for centuries. When he digs into ancient libraries, he documents debates from which fragments were only available in archaic Latin. Persons have beseeched Rome before for translations, but to no avail.There is a stark difference between a new riddle with no end and an old riddle with a new and plausible explanation. I personally think that we have discovered a new Sagan and perhaps even a new Edgar Cayce. Judging from the reviews of both books, I am not the only one who thinks so.F ""Seinfeld"" Mt. Vernon."
3,A good book,"What can be said about a book that is about religion,history, and murder. I like a book that I can sit and read to relax and enjoy. Not one that makes me want to stop and think.If you like a good murder mystery this book has it. This is not a book that I would reread. It has to much to keep track of."
2,Anti-religious Mystery,"This book is a fine mystery, except for the anti-religious themes.I am a Christian and believe the Bible to be the word of God, and 100% accurate - and this book claims in it's story that the New Testament is false along with countless other inaccurate accusations.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a Christian, because you will be very disappointed by the story and it's alternate view."
1,The best atheist book ever written! Just beware of this book!,"Have you read all by Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Hugo, or Hemingway? O'Neill or Goethe? Or by other titans? Ignore this book and do not waste your time and mind! Hitler and Lenin would envy Dan Brown who managed to write this anti-God and anti-Human book! Full of blasphemy! If you think of your life after you join your beloved ones high, up with the Gentle Fella, then read the Bible and just beware of this book. Shame on the author! Though he did one great thing - all the people of all beliefs are united, and they are united against this blasphemy! Read prayers, think of your beloved ones and think about your life...."
2,This goes for a great book?,"I know that the world is still somewhat obsessed with this book, and I I guess I can understand why. It's a lot of fun, I will admit, and Dan Brown certainly did his homework, authentic or not, on some awesome bits of history and religion. This provides a super-fun mystery--hey, who doesn't appreciate a super-fun mystery with lots of fast-paced action?However, so totally overrated! I think so much of the hype came from the supposedly controversial nature. You know what? Make up your own minds and stop letting fiction decide your beliefs for you!It is definitely a fun read, but the characters are ridiculous, cliche, and flat, as well as the relationships."
3,At Least It Moves Fast,"Dan Brown has much to say in Da Vinci Code (most of the details which can be found in the very silly, yet richly entertaining, vaguely non-fiction book, Holy Blood and Holy Grail). It is too bad that story crafted around his polemics could not have been more intriguing, the characters stronger, or the writing better. Too often, characters give long speeches about ""symbology"" (by which I think they mean symbolism), frequently while being chased on foot. I can barely sputter two words while on the tread mill but it is nice to know that a cryptanalyst and a university professor are so much more fit than I. The author does keep The Da Vinci Code's action moving quickly though and has fashioned a very satisfying ending that wraps up all the loose ends in a moving manner. The book is not all it could be but it could be so much worse."
4,Conspiracy fans take note,"I just recently saw ""The Adoration of the Magi"" in the Uffizi in Florence, so this book really resonates for me. It makes me want to go back and take a fresh look at Botticelli's art, at the Mona Lisa, medieval architecture, and the Bible. I rarely put much credence in elaborately constructed conspiracies, but there is much to fascinate in this novel. The only people I've ever known who were Masons, Rosicrucians, members of various Catholic subcultures, and so forth always struck me as supremely silly people with too much time on their hands. Maybe I ought to take a closer look at them too!"
5,Remember to breathe!,"I was so hooked into this book I almost literally had to remind myself to breathe! What a challenge to figure out what is going to happen ahead of time.Please, PLEASE, to all those ""lookers""....DO NOT READ THE ENDING FIRST....You'll spoil it!"
3,Venus Pentacle in Double Time,"A fun read, and a tremendous stylistic improvement over his earlier, mind-numbing ""Digital Fortress"", which was too reminiscent of the (very) early Michener. But, inexcusable factual errors show up a bit too early; on page 36, read:""As a young astronomy student, Langdon had been stunned to learn the planet Venus traced a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every four years.""Not so! The Venus synodic cycle of five (5) equidistant occultations occuring each 584 days, or 1.6 years, takes eight (8) years to complete -- 8/5 = 1.6, approximating the mathematical ratio 1.618, labelled Phi, also known as the ""Golden Mean""...But it is a fun read."
5,Fabulous!,"This was a fabulous, fast-paced, intriguing read. The plot was as intricate as a maze and highly entertaining. It was particularly fascinating to learn so much about the sacred Feminine throughout history. I seldom read a book that teaches me something I never knew before..particularly in Math of all things. I'm very happy to learn that Mr. Brown is working on a sequel. I highly recommend this book if you're looking for an exciting, unputdownable read. You won't be disappointed."
2,Story based on poor scholarship,"Brown relies on the theories presented in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail, a work of of very shoddy scholarship. It makes huge leaps in logic and ignores many of it's cited sources. The Gnostic Gospel of Thomas actually presents Jesus as a male chauvist not someone who repsects the ""sacred feminine."" In it he says women will only enter heaven when they ""become like men."" It is interesting to note that the UC at Berkely (not exactly a pro-Christian institution) has a course on recognizing bad logic, and Holy Blood (Brown's basis for this novel)is required reading. Check out the university website and see for yourself. There are also many mistakes related to Leonardo and his works; a big one being the portrayal in the novel of the Madonna of the Rocks being on canvas (it was painted on wood). None of this would matter if Brown had not claimed to have researched his facts in order to write this story."
2,DaVinci Hype,"I bought this book based on the NY Times ecstatic review. It certainly did not live up to the hype. The most interesting parts were those giving the ""historical"" background to the grail legend. The rest was substandard suspense fare--one contrived cliff-hanger after another, written in some of the most amateurish prose I have ever read in a published novel. The characters are cartoonish, and the plot is so transparently mechanical you can see the gears turning as the author cranks up yet another improbable twist. The final revelations are of the type that give you a sinking feeling in your stomach. Botton line: this is a purely plot-driven book with interesting arcane religious lore thrown in."
2,"Not offensive, but not good fiction either","I finally caved in to the hype and read this book. I wasn't expecting richly developed characters or elegant writing or intricately woven themes. But I did think there would at least be an intriguing plot and some suspense. Instead, what I found was a ridiculous plot, paper thin characters, bland writing, and not much suspense. And, suspense was supposed to be the strong point. Honestly, I thought the ending to this book was foreshadowed pretty heavily.As far as the controversy goes, this is fiction. The piece of nonfiction that provided most of the background is widely regarded as hogwash by scholars. So, I think those who are offended are making a mountain out of a mole hill.I know a lot of people just want a mindless read and don't want a book that will make them think. If that is the case, you may enjoy the book. However, I still think there are better works of suspense out there if you look for them."
3,Just OK,"Am I the only one here who had no strong feelings for this book? I was neither offended nor enlightened. Simply this was just an ok book. At the beginning the plot was interesting and all of the extraneous facts actually served some type of purpose, but about midway through the book lost its zeal. It became a typically mystery with an average ending. Its topic was relatively new (a mystery surrounding the church) but that does not make up for following subsequent mystery rules.There are better books out there...that will truly wow you. The fact that this book is doing so well disheartens me as there are many more books more deserving. Look around people, just don't follow the crowd."
5,Great thriller,"This is a great fiction book, for those who see it as just that, fiction. It takes you on a quest for the Holy Grail, which , in the book, turns out to be the quest for the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, though symbology in DaVinci's work, among others. If you follow it as a work of fiction, you will be amazed by the possibilities. If you take it as ""truth"" then you might feel betrayed by what you thought you knew. I recommend you do not try to change history through this book. I'm sure a lot of historians will agree. This book will keep you going until the last minute; couldn't put it down! I definitely recommend it."
3,Little disappointing,"While DavVinci Code keep its promise of puzzle after puzzle, it has a disappointing ""continuous car chase"" in the first third of the book. The ending was quite a let down.Angels and Demons was far superior in its richness and art with spectacular scenes as well as scenery. Lets hope Dan's next novel doesn't disappoint as much as this one. I love Robert Langdon and hope we get to see him again soon."
3,Not a Bad Read. It IS Fiction after all.,"Not a bad read. The story flowed quite nicely, until the final 3rd of the book, that's when it really slowed down to a snail's pace. Intruiging nontheless. Worth the read. Do your own research and you be the judge. That's what I am doing right now, researching on pagan gods and rituals."
5,Informative Read,"After watching this book stay on the bestseller list for month after month, I decided to finally discover for myself what this book was about. And boy was I surprised. Although the characters are fictional, the historical events and people are real. This book allowed me to see Christianity in a different light. But I am skeptical as to how much of it is true. Many of the reviewers of this book complain that the book is full of inaccuracies and mistakes, but I thought it was a great read. It's fiction, albeit historical fiction, but what did some of the readers expect when they opened a work of fiction? Fact? I hope not. All I know is that I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I found it interesting, informative, and suspensful. That is probably what Dan Brown intended the book to be and that is what I got from it. And for that, it was worth my time and money."
4,"Like ""Angels and Demons"" sideways","If you've read one, you've read 'em both! That's how I feel about ""The Da Vinci Code"" and Dan Brown's similar ""Angels and Demons."" These books are parallel in so many ways that it is almost ridiculous: an ""expert"" gets murdered in a bizarre, cruel fashion; the beautiful daughter of the ""expert"" searches for the killer by hooking up with a Harvard professor; there is much religious symbolism; there is a cruel, unstoppable assassin who takes orders from a cruel, all-knowing unidentified director; there are challenging puzzles for the protagonaist to solve (in ""Da Vinci"" at least the reader gets to play along); there is cliffhanger after improbable cliffhanger; etc.; etc.; etc.However, all this is not to say that both books are not great reads, wildly entertaining, and frankly, very interesting, in their revelations about the Holy Grail and the Knights Templar(""Da Vinci"") and the Illuminati (""Angels""). I recommend both books, but you really only have to read one"
5,Christianity is a 2000 year old lie!,"If you like this book read ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"" by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. I say DOWN with christianity! Wake up people, a new age is upon us! No more killing in the name of a false god."
1,this book is not base on the Bible,"This book is very confusing and not base on the bible, I think it is just some people who don;t really understand the Bible and have nothing to do so they just write books."
2,Great Writing to the Detriment of Society,The Da Vinci Code along with Angels and Demons were written very well I thought. They keep you reading and wondering what is going to happen next. They are however both going to contribute to societal decay. That makes them harmful rather then just inert entertainment. I have read them both but many with little faith or knowledge seem to be treating them as fact instead fiction sprinkled with a few facts which is what they are. Since societal evolution is so important I cannot recommend this book.
1,Anti-Catholic Propaganda,"If you consider yourself a practicing Catholic this book should not be on your read list. An author with an axe to grind against the Church uses this fictional story to push a feminist, modernist, anti-clerical agenda. As usual the Catholic hating media has picked up on this book as some great piece of literature with new ideas. Same old heresies and grumblings against the church, just packaged in a different way. Save your time, money, and even your Soul skip this book and wait for Mel Gibson's movie."
3,Jesus and Mary Have a Baby? Say What?!,"Yes, that is the fantastic premise of The DaVinci Code. Dan Brown very cleverly mingles fact with fiction to create a highly suspenseful thriller about a super secret society dedicated to protecting an explosive revelation about Jesus and his relationship with Mary Magdalene. But the incredible fascination over whether the premise of this work of fiction is true is very disturbing. It's just a story, folks. In the same way that the Left Behind series is nothing but a highly dubious fictionalized ""prediction"" of the Apocalypse, the DaVinci Code is just a fun read when your brain is tired. But don't make anything more of it than that. Please."
1,No much here,"Misticism for the masses, ideal for fat ladies chatting in the coiffeur.Read Umberto Eco, not this. It was written with a movie in sight, Albino killer, etc, etc. Crap."
1,I Feel Cheated,"I feel cheated,any amount paid for this is robbery!!!This is the worst book and storyline I've ever read.I tried to finish it but with little or no value in his story I couldn't stomach any more!Some of his ideas border on the insane,others demand you park your brain outside the door.Save your money don't buy this book.I wish I hadn't."
5,Amazed,"When I read the Da Vinci Code, i had no idea it would be as detailed, intricate, and accurate as people said it was. After I finished, I was amazed at the work Dan Brown had to go through to write this book.The book starts in the Louvre, an art museum in Paris. A man is brutally murdered, and later Robert Langdon is called to the scene. Apparently, he was to meet the victim, Jaques Sauniere, over lunch. Soon he becomes the prime suspect in Jaques Sauniere's murder. Robert Langdon travels all over Europe trying to decipher the secret that Jaque Sauniere was murdered for, an age-old secret involving Christ, The Bible, The Holy Grail and th Knights of Templar.I would recommend this for all ages, though the main plot may not be appropriate for younger children. I also recommend to mystery lovers, conspirators, and anyone who likes a good puzzle."
2,I liked it but,"I just finished reading the Davinci Code. I liked it but ..it is badly written, very inaccurate history and a bit childish in it's overall structure. However, taken with a grain of salt , it was a very good read.I wish the author had been a wee bit more careful about his research ,I found the glaring historical errors a bit off-putting. Still, the story of the Murder at the Louvre, the mystery of secret sects, the Vatican, Da Vinci and so on is intriging and I found that in spite of the literary and historical medocrity of it all, I could not stop turning the pages. Surely that is the measure of any work of fiction..we keep turning the pages. A great Beach Book. Perhaps it will also serve the purpose of having people search out the true facts."
1,Yawn,"The writing is mediocre, the characters poorly drawn. Mr. Brown writes with an irritating pedantic style that is exacerbated by incorrect information and poor fact checking. Example: We are told that the source of the term ""left wing"" is identical to the source of gauche and sinister when it in fact it relates to the seating arrangements in the French National Assembly.The characters behave in ways that defy rationality or comprehension. Do yourself a favor and skip this dog."
1,"If your a christian, then dont read this book!","If you have already read this book, then you can check the facts. He cant get the correct date for the Qumran discovery, how can he pretend to give any other factual information. I recomend the dictionary of Apologetics by Norm Geisler for the answers to these weak suppositions.( apologetics are NOT apologies, they are the giving of an answer for the REASON behind your faith). The christian faith has nothing to fear from this sort of sensationalastic endeavor, but I wanted to warn any new christians about this book. It is not a christian book! Those who think this book is good-natured fun are mistaken. Re-writing history is serious no matter what kind of history you're talking about, fiction or not. However I will say one thing about the gnostic gospels that may make it clearer... In a thousand years when someone discovers a copy of the national inquirer, who is going to explain it to them!"
2,"Weak storytelling, too predictable","I was forced to read this book in my book club. Very disappointing! Interesting theories, but the storyline was too predictable to keep me interested. As I read, I could already visualize the movie...reminded me of John Gresham's good idea/bad-writing-turned-screenplay style. And while the author claims much of this book is based on fact, much of it is really only based on theories. As the book is catagorized as fiction, I have no problem with a book based on theory. However, it has to be supported by a well-told story to keep me interested. Couldn't even make it to the end!"
2,Pretentious crap.,"Give me a break! I was lead to believe this was something special, it's not. Poorly written,poorly (biased) research thatwill lead all the gullibles to the band wagon.The characters, the plot, the very idea are laughable. Lookelsewhere for the truth."
4,"Readerly, not writerly book","...clunky writing. That's a fair complaint, except that this is a ""readerly"" (i.e., like Grisham, but better) not ""writerly"" (i.e., Styron) book. Don't buy this book expecting character development and beautiful prose. This is about a fantastic plot, but I did figure out the codes before they were revealed and the 2-page chapters got on my nerves (-1 star). But it's a page turner, and makes me want to do some research on the subject matter to see how much is fictional, how much conspiracy-theory, and how much truth."
3,Read it but don't expect a masterpiece...,"This book started out with an interesting premise that seemed to be building up to something but then didn't. ""The Da Vinci Code"" was engaging and a little bit addictive--for my desire to drag myself through the writing to find out what happened, not for its literary value. I found that it was a little hypocritical that although an idea of the story was the suppression of the ""divine feminine"" in society, the female protagonist was still portrayed as needing a male protector and at the end, the interesting tension between the two melted down to a simplistic let's-give-the-readers-what-they-want romance. The way that Brown worked his research into the story seemed chunky and forced, and his techniques for keeping readers in suspense were quite crude. Still, this book brings up a few interesting ideas and manages to hold your interest...just put the jacket from some other novel on it if you're somewhere with a lot of intelligent people."
5,WOW,I heard about this book on an AM news show and thought that it sounded interesting. This book was fantastic! It makes you think about everything you ever learned in Church. I could not put it down. I stayed up on a Sunday night till after midnight just so I finish it. A great read!
4,"I couldn""t put it down!","This book was an absolutely incredible page turner. If you love mystery books, look no further. This is the one that will keep you wanting to read more!"
4,A Good Read,I read this book before reading any other books by Dan Brown. Just like Angels & Demons this is fast-paced and held my interest. Dan Brown is very good at leaving you guessing until the very end of the book. The religious aspect did not bother me at all and I found it very interesting. What people need to keep in mind is that it is a work of fiction. Dan Brown isn't claiming it to be true.
4,Great book,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It does offer a different view other than the one we have all been taught since birth.
5,"An Entertaining, Enlightening Thriller","This book is simply magnificent. The plot is very fast-paced, but it is also evenly distributed and never lags. Brown has put together a fascinating look at religion, art, and modern intrigue, blending the three seamlessly. While the plot is somewhat predictable, this book is meant to simply be enjoyed and to revel in the details. The facts are astounding and will actually make you question the fine line between Brown's research and his imagination. You'll be doing frantic online searches to view the art discussed in the book and look for the details that Brown points out. Also, if you have been to Europe or would simply like to go, this book poses an extra delight by taking place in many of France and England's most famous attractions. Simply stated, this book will be impossible to put down and must be bought and savored."
1,good luck Mr. Howard,"If Ron Howard (a director with an excellent reputation) attempts to make this pop culture novel into a movie, he is going to need a lot of luck. In order to make it appeal to the masses, it will be necessary to tone down the obvious anti-Catholic and anti-Christian agenda which drives the silly plot.Dan Brown's ""research"" which has been exposed as little more than of the urban legend variety, will be quickly dismissed by legitimate scholars. I suppose that could create the desired buzz, but I predict that the movie will be received much like Martin Scorcese's ""Last Temptation of Christ,"" a movie that had a much more compelling story-line, but was not exactly a blockbuster.May I suggest a few options as a title for the movie:""Raider's of Intelligence,"" ""Ron Howard and the Movie of Doom,"" or ""Dan Brown and His Disceptive Crusade."""
1,Don't believe the hype,"... I found this book contrived, the suspense artificially manufactured, with fake cliffhangers every couple of pages. I found the inevitable revelation was something I figured out right around page 50, so no big surprise, and I had to slog through a lot of bad writing and reams of factoids (some of them wrong, by the way). It's like the author thinks he'll snow us with Too Much Information. Plus a lot of the information was irrelevant mind game stuff, like the Fibonacci numbers and all that. Why he had to go pick on Opus Dei as a villain I don't know -- I hold no brief for them, but they're just not cartoon bad guys like he makes them out to be. And it makes no sense that the victim whose death starts out the book would put his granddaughter on this endless scavenger hunt -- that was what really felt contrived. How anyone can compare this potboiler to ""Name of the Rose"" is beyond me."
4,Wasn't a boondoggle XP,"This book is nothing less than entertaining. If you like suspense, secret societies, or conspiracy theories, then this is a book is worth reading.Before I ever read any of Dan Browns novels, I always had heard them to be predictable, over the top, taboo monstroseties. (the reason I say taboo is because my family is Roman Catholic and to them, to say Jesus was married, with children was, well, preposterous.) But once I read Angels And Demons, I knew I had to finish the series. The writing styles Brown expressed made visualizing the novel easy. the story line, I admit, is a little hard to follow at the beginning, although once you're a few chapters in you wont be able to put the book down. you can't help but to appreciate the attention to detail portrayed in this masterpiece. If you haven't read this book yet you should at least give it a try, and you might find it to be worth your while."
2,Save your money,Lots of information which is supposed to be fact set around a preposterous story line make this book hard to swallow. Sorry only 2 stars.
3,Da Vinci Code = Angels and Demons v2.0,"Last year, I read ""Angels and Demons"" before my trip to Italy and find it a interest/better than average read.And when I started to read Da Vinci Code, I find myself comparing the 2 book. I've find so many similarity between them.IMHO, Da Vinci Code is just a improve version of Angels and Demons"
1,It Does Not Even Deserve One Star...,"I read this book because my ex bought it and raved about the greatness of Dan Brown. I read the book, out of boredom, I am a reader it is what I do, I read anything and everything. The only thing this book is good for is a door stop. The writing was bland, dry, and the story line predicatable. He took certain ""facts"" threw it in a bag mixed it all around and poofy, you have before you ""The Davinci Code."" It was so awful I had to run to look at an Agatha Christie, at David Eddings, anything to erase what I had just read. My advice, do not read it, just pick up another book, any book, and not one written by him. I am still wondering how he, a terrible writer, got published. The publishing industry, thus far, has shown they have lowered thier standards as of late!!"
2,Not Recommended,"I love mysteries and this book kept my attention to a point. However, the author presented many religious theories as facts (I think the research was lacking). The more I read, it became apparent that this novel was an attack on the Catholic Church as well as traditional Christianity. I found this troubling since some readers will view his 'theories' as the Gospel truth. I wonder about the author's background - I kept feeling as though a bad experience with the Catholic Church was the basis for this book."
1,An attack to history,"This is a fiction book that tries to position itself as well-documented, when indeed lots of things are simply invented. Moreover, it attacks the Catholic Church and the figure of Christ telling lies that try to appear as truths to the simple and undocumented mind."
2,Light weight fare,"Never buy a book with the word Code in the title. That is one message that can be derived from a perusal of this book. But perusal is perhaps too strong. The book does not require careful reading to reveal that it is built on rather flimsy intellectual foundations, and that the writing is very awkward. There are some interesting asides pertaining to historic survivals, and to the origin of words, but for the reader who loves the crafting of words, richness of style, this book is a vast disappointment."
2,After all the hype - disappointment,"After hearing and reading about this book for a year, I finally borrowed a copy and read it. All I can say is I'm disappointed. While it began with an interesting premise, the writing was so mediocre that I finished it only so I could discuss the book with a friend who recommended it. It struck me as just an ""airplane"" novel - one you pick up at the airport because you're just looking for something quick and easy to pass the time. It's not even close to serious literature. I'm also scared to death there are people out there who actually believe the story. But I suppose that's all you can expect at a time when bashing the Christian Church has become an art form."
1,Awful Pap! actually 0.5 of a star...,Poor storytelling that copies/plagerizes everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Heat just not as well and certainly with no disguise.Not sure if catholic bashing is a sport yet but Brown certainly pushed the envelope. Very predictable and very corny - great possibilities but never got off the ground. The characters are horrible stereoypical that I would be suprised if this makes it to a B movie at best. A dis-service to the material for sure.
2,Yeck....,"This is a definite page turner. One which left a bad taste in my mouth. A horrible, predictable plot, shallow characterization and star crossed hints of romance that detract from the plot.The only reason this deserves two stars is because of the way it presents an age old myth, the holy grail, in a different light that the public rarely sees. Now, let's remember, this book is fiction. I'm sure Brown took liberties to make his research fit into an idea that had amazing potential. If you're interested in the grail story, ditch this book and read some of the nonfiction books out there on the topic.For those who are trashing this on the basis of their religion, something to watch out for lest it destroy your faith........ what is your faith without challenges? Nothing.If you're a Christian with blinders on, maybe you should read it, if for nothing more than the challenge it will present to you."
5,Can't wait for next one,"I was standing on the beach last summer talking to a friend when she recommended this book. I enjoyed it so much that after reading it, I went on to read every other book that Dan Brown has written, and I loved them all. Several times during the reading of this book I had to go to the Internet to look up items involved in the story, and felt that I ended up with a book that not only entertained me, but enriched me from a cultural standpoint. However, there's an even bigger story out there. What if Jesus returned and everyone missed it? ""A Thief in the Night"" by William Sears tells the story of his personal search for the answer to this question, and I'm hoping Dan Brown will pick up on it someday and turn it into another best seller."
2,Made to be a Movie,"I was expecting an intriguing look at the history of the Catholic Church and it's representation in art. What I found was a ""Tom Clancy"" novel with predictable characters. If you are looking for a page-turning murder mystery, that will make a popular movie - this is it. If you are looking for something deeper and thought provoking you will need to look elsewhere."
2,Somewhat Engaging,"I think the core problem is that once you figure out what the puzzle is, you lose interest. It's not a very captivating object of mystery for most people. And the repetition of everything--the endless puzzles, chases, clues, villain/hero determinations. Yawn. Best part was the first 30 pages. Last few pages were hardly an ample reward for enduring this long, twisted, predictable tale. Quel surpris! The Sophie's entire family REALLY didn't die in a car accident? What moron couldn't have foreseen that? Get out of here? Sophie, the gorgeous code expert, and Robert, the warm-hearted, lonely, academic live happily ever after?"
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"After much hype and many people telling me what a deep and interesting book this is, I was ready for a wonderful read. Instead I found a silly mystery that could be solved by my cat, insipid and vapid chacter development and a title some editor came up with to sell the book. Don't even bother."
1,Da Vinci Disappointment,"Does overrated mean anything? I actually paid retail for this much hyped book only to discover a poorly researched tome that bashed the Catholic Church (I am not a Catholic) as well as Christianity in general. If feminist goddess religion is your bag, you might like it, but don't count on its historical accuracy."
1,Very disappointing,"I'll keep this short, as I already wasted too much time reading the book. I admit I read this hoping that there was something unique about it. Sadly disappointing in its predictability. Anytime the sleeve notes say something like ""wickedly clever"" or ""a must read"", run, run far away."
2,Give me a break,"This book started out with a bang: a thriller of a first chapter. I had such high hopes. But the further I read, the more disgusted I became. The plot and the theology became more and more sensational and outrageous. Dan Brown certainly has a right to express his views on church history and theology, but as a conservative Christian, I personally found it offensive. I would imagine most Catholics would take offense at the corrupt and negative characterization of the Church. I went away from the book with a sick feeling."
1,Mr. Brown writes like he has ADD,"A short, choppy ""thriller,"" written for people with short attention spans, deserves no place on the bestseller list. Every short sentence, poorly-written visual description, screams ""Make a movie out of my book! Make me richer and give me a way to push my obnoxious, poorly-researched ideas onto the gullible moviegoing public!"""
3,After 300 pages forget it!,The first 300 pages of this novel were exciting and as suspenseful as FOCAULT'S PENDULUM. At a critical juncture the story fell apart. I am very disappointed!
1,The Da Vinci Code,"Fun reading, addictive fiction (though the prose and style leave much to be desired), if it were not for Brown's claim that all facts, rituals, etc are ""accurate"". Oh my! Umberto Eco has done way better in entertaining the reader while being historically accurate at the same time. Brown smuggles crackpot history for facts, along the worse Hollywood style. So be it... I do not recommed this book to anyone interested in learning rather than being entertained."
1,"Dear dear, no!","This is such a dull book, really, but lots of people bought it! It is great undigested pieces of information downloaded from Google and pasted together with rubbish cliche characters! And it is also very disrespectful to the Christian faith, only not even in a funny or clever way. It is a sad comment on Canada that I have seen so many people reading it in public these last years."
1,Embarrassing,"While reading it I kept thinking, 'the good stuff has to start soon'. Not so. It's not thought provoking, certainly not mysterious (easy to guess the plot twists, such as they are, without much effort) and not shocking at all. I can't imagine why it became a best seller except for the hype. Waste of time."
3,SO THERE IS SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH,"It's not a bad thriller, albeit slow-paced and structurally inferior to some of Brown's earlier writing. What is ultimately lacks, on all levels, is authenticity: It is less convincing as a political conspiracy novel than, say, ""The Day of the Jackal""; much less readable as literature than ""Harry Potter""; less reliable as history than the average period bodice-ripper. So why has it sold millions? Pure quantum mechanics - no more predictable than a lottery win. Read it if you must - there are far worse pot-boilers on the station bookshelf - but don't let it change your worldview. If you want a philosophical yarn that means something, try ""Sophie's World"" or (for post-hippy masochists) ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance""."
3,Facile and Pat,"WHile this story had some interesting information (or factoids), it was too pat and shallow to be worth all the hype. I recommend the art history mysteries by Iain Pears for better potboilers, and Pears's An Instance of the Fingerpost for a better novel with some depth."
3,Not such a hot book,"Well, two of my friends insisted I read this book, so I did. I've read better books, although I did finish it. I guess the 'rapid fire' and 'action-packed' etc, etc, nature of the book got to me, it all seems a bit pat, i.e. the right things just keep happening to these two rather flat characters. It would be a good airplane book, the kind you could read and follow with a huge jet engine roaring outside your window.I haven't reviewed a book that had 1200 other Amazon reviews, and I see huge piles of this book in the brick-and-mortar stores, so I am probably in the minority on this one."
5,Couldn't put it down,"A great book. A very pleasant surprise. I finished it very fast and kept awake to finish it.I liked its use of puzzles, a great historical perspective and its gripping pace.The twists and turns are truly amazing. Very well crafted.I also liked its perspective on the current state of the world and how by incorporating elements of compassion we can improve.A 'must read'."
1,Just Look at the Pictures,"I realize that I'm coming late to the critical table on this one, but I've only just read it. Pointless though denouncements may be in the face of this book's popularity, I thought it was awful; shoddy religious history, overdone narrative devices, and stock characters in the service of a story that comes to a weak and displaced conclusion that seems to have dropped out of the sky into the final chapter. Everyone loved it, I know. Not me. The illustrations were the only pleasurable part of the experience."
3,A good read if you lower your expectations,"The book and its topic are fascinating cocktail party talk - but I don't think the book lives up to the hype. I read this in one afternoon - it was engaging and enjoyable, but not great literature or (yes, a bad pun) the bible truth. I know it is fiction, but I thought the author took some liberties with the geography of Paris, as well as the actual history of the Priory and Templar Knights, which I found distracting. I enjoy reading books set in places I am familiar with and inaccurancies take away from that. It's just not that hard to get from the Louvre to the American Embassy. I'd recommend it, but with a few caveats."
5,Oh I'm really cool cause I hate something that everyone love,"At this point all the reviews are obviously bad. I just finished the book and must tell you it's a great thriller. I've followed Da Vinci's works a lot of time and this is just an incredible point of view, and an awesome way of introducing some culture to our stupid-religious society. I hope it spread it's word over the seas. Greatly recomended. Don't hear those trying to be different by low-rating this masterpiece."
2,Overated and predictable,"Sorry, I don't agree with all the hype. I found the book boring at times and to be honest about half way through the book I realized I didn't care what happened to the main characters. I only finished the book because everyone I know had read it...so I thought it would get better as I got to the end...It didn't!Some of the history of the Catholic church is interesting... but that is about it!Don't bother."
2,Certainly not literature....,"I have to say, although Dan Brown has an interesting web of trivia thrown into a loosely created plot, it does not make for good reading or literature. What it makes is Dan Brown a very wealthy man!!!! Go for the big bucks Dan! Just like Danielle Steele and Stephen King - quite a sell-out, really. Just toss the Davinci Code into your magazine rack along with your Pottery Barn Catalogue."
1,Give me a break,"People that you know who have read this book, share knowing looks and invite you, rather cautiously, to take part thereof and be one of them. Enlightened by the great knowledge that is hidden between the covers of the Da Vinci Code.So you do and although you find the writing surprisingly mediocre, you continue hoping that the secret it holds will make you one in the Fellowship of Da Vinci heads.And what, dear reader, is the great secret that has been kept from us for 20 centuries?Women are receptacles! Containers, that's what we are. For what you might ask? I'll give you one guess.Quick someone alert Betty Friedan!"
1,If only I could give 0 stars!,"After reading Brown's gripping novel, Angels & Demons, I expected The Da Vinci Code to be an exciting page turner. Unfortunately, I didn't expect that the novel would have essentially the same plot as its predecessor, making it completely predictable. The books even begin the same way: man gets murdered, Langdon is called in, and some beautiful woman turns up who is related to the victim, attracted to Langdon, and wants to help him solve the crime. Please, does he think he's the next James Bond? True, Brown weaves in many interesting tidbits of information, but that didn't make reading this book worth my time. Out of the two, I'd say Angels and Demons was the better read."
1,"Great idea, lousy book","There's no ""there"" there. From the subtle-as-a-sledgehammer character names (and characters) to the contrived cliffhangers ending every short-attention-span chapter, this was a book designed, its convoluted conspiracy theories notwithstanding, for someone looking for something to do while waiting for an airplane or the laundry, and wishing to seem intellectual while doing so. An intriguing idea and a great story that deserved a much, much better book."
1,Such an Interesting Premise--such poor writing,"Having heard Dan Brown interviewed on NPR, I bought this book thinking it would be a cut above the standard thriller genre of airport paperbacks. Unfortunately, the character development was one-dimensional to non-existent, the prose was on a sixth-grade reading level and the story was so implausible as to insult one's intelligence. It is a shame that the years of research Brown discussed in detail with his interviewer produced such a disappointing result"
1,Sub-Jeffrey Archer,"I couldn't put this book down, such was my desire to finish it and to move on to something written with an adult audience in mind. It failed entirely to stimulate the right side of my brain (that's the RIGHT side, dummy). But it has done a fine job of stabilising an erstwhile wobbly coffee table.I'm all in favour of debunking the myths on which organised religions are built. But the only myths this airport trash debunks are that the author is capable of (a) writing literature and (b) getting his facts straight."
1,just plain dumb,"Some have called The Da Vinci Code blasphemous. I would suggest that in order to qualify for such an accusation the book would have to achieve some level of credibility. It does not. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the book is just plain dumb. Indeed it is moronic, puesdo-history, pop culture crapola.If you thought the half-time show during the superbowl had artistic value, this low-level junk might appeal to you. Indeed, I believe that the intellectual vaccuum that is the Da Vinci Code, could actually make you dumber having read it. Especially if you are gullible enough to buy into it. Regrettably it seems many readers are.Dan Brown is a hack and worse dishonest. Unfortunately it remains possible to make lots of money feeding junk food to the suckers amongst us. Wake up people. Just say no to the Oreo, Big Mac, revisionist history pushing fiends. Yes, wake up and smell the clean fresh aroma of nourishment for the body, soul and spirit. Seek the truth and you will find it."
1,What a potboiler!,"I read this based on many recommendations. As long as you don't expect anything of higher quality than a typical waiting-at-the-airport book, go for it. But don't count on it for anything else. Stereotypical characters (an albino killer monk? please!) and situations. I'm glad I didn't buy this, but read a lent copy instead."
3,"Great 1st half, then...","OK, so this was my first Dan Brown book. I thought it was well written and found the historical notes throughout the book very interesting. I wish there was an easier way to find out for myself what is actually true, not being one to trust someone just because they put it in print. :)When the plot is finally uncovered I found myself laughing out loud! I'm not a big believer in conspiracies...do you know any group of people who can keep a secret? To say that Christianity is flawed because an artist believed Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a child...then to go on and talk about gods & goddesses, the age of pisces and aquarious...I found this so contradictory. I just do not get people who saw this as so revolutionary!"
2,Killer-thriller,"Artfully written thriller, intelligent and lucid fiction based on... History?! It is the best possible comment to the book ""History:Fiction or Science?"" that proves consensual History itself to be a complete FICTION!! I enjoyed the reading, but the ideas behind the ""Da Vinci-Code"" are erroneous and misleading. Why should we allow to be made a fool of?"
2,"Fiction, Not Fact","A story fascinatingly told. However, the author would like the reader to think there is some factual basis for his story -- and that's pure fallacy. Good imagination, but dreadful distortion of history."
1,"Great promise, quickly fades.","What starts out as a page turner, quickly becomes just another fast-paced movie script, with no character development. The plot grows more unbelievable and ultimately ridiculous."
5,A Fun Read!,"This is a fun, entertaining book. Take it to the beach and start turning the pages! You can almost see the movie as you read this thriller.Dan Brown has successfully arbitraged a lot of research about the Holy Grail and Mary Magdelene and the Knights Templar with the general public's lack of awareness of all that research into a cosmic whodunit.Along the way, you learn about Fibonacci Numbers, The Codex Leiscester, church and art history and mythology.If you want to know more about all the issues the plot deals with, buy ""The Templar Revelation"", by Picknett and Prince, at the same time(published in 1998, the first chapter is entitled ""The Secret Code of Leaonardo DaVinci""!). Their non-fiction book describes in depth practically everything The DaVinci Code treats in this fictional representation."
2,Lame-o!,"I love to read, and sometimes I'll even pick up a book my husband has purchased when I don't have anything of my own to read, as I did with this book. Dan Brown wants to impress you with some zany controversial facts, but he cuts corners by writing a lame unconvincing ""thriller"" around them. Like, I don't understand why Sophie would be so upset at her grandfather that she wouldn't speak to him for 10 years. What she saw wasn't even that big of a deal! That just doesn't make sense. But of course, Mr. Brown wants you to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at the Biblical ""facts."" I think that the story itself is incredibly lame, do Langdon and Sophie really have to spark a romance at the end?! Why?! Gimme a break! I'm insulted. He should've just started a conspiracy website and loaded his facts there instead of wasting perfectly good trees on this stinker!"
1,why can't I give this no stars?,"I mean, come on... there has to be 0 as a default right? No? Oh well.Anyway, back to the review. This is book is tosh. Forget the actual proposition, which I forget now. How could one get even halfway through it?I was guffawing every time I picked it up. Clouseau playing Indiana Jones, brilliant!A thought for any Americans who think this is some kind of hyper-historical European Disney tour. Try driving a rental up the Tuileries any time, please! Man, I would like to see that.In acclaiming this book you speak loudly, though not eloquently, of your profound ignorance of all things noble."
1,"False Doctrine, False teaching, FALSE BOOK","(1)If your Roman Catholic like I am, DON'T read this book. If your a devout Christian like I am,DON'T read this book. This book in its entirety is anti-Christian, anti-pope,and a ""twisted"" history in it. Dan Brown,whose name sounds like a hundred bells ringing, writes a ""true-false"" book; he has some truth about some of the things in this book but, he puts some ""made-up"" things in there too.(2)The plot itself is wrong also. The clymax comes right after the first two pages and stays there for eight more pages.It is a shame the a newley discoverd author (Dan Brown) would makes such a false book.P.S. The star I put for the rating is for the publishers. I work for them."
1,Christians Beware,"The first half of the book is well-written and very interesting. Beyond that, I couldn't finish what I thought was a great thriller. In good conscience, I couldn't keep reading beyond the blasphemy of Christianity and my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I sent my copy to the dump."
1,What's the shouting all about?,"This is only a beach read summer best-seller at best. Brown takes on the Catholic Church's right-wing Opus Dei movement, and a second group that is a little known pseudo-descendent of the Knights Templar movement and tosses in some art history and symbol analysis for good measure.But it's all lightweight, just on the top. He touches lightly on the subject of the Opus Dei, and hints that I.M. Pei's puramid designs for the Louvre are tied into ancient goddess symbols. But he pulls his punches each time. and we're left what seems like a shooting script for a not-very-cerebral car-crash movie.Yes, the Opus Dei is real, and yes, ``The Work,'' as the group is known, probably has sinister intentions. But Brown failed to give us enough. It's ""expos√© lite"", fit for not much more than a lazy August day at the beach."
5,Another Catholic Cover-Up?,"Man! Dan Brown must have some beef with the Catholic Church. But I must say, his beef makes for a good read. I've never learned so much from reading fiction in the whole of my life. Brown's research is meticulous, so much so that you start to believe his books should be in the non-fiction section. I truly enjoyed this book. Breaking codes and following clues...Brown has presented an engaging mystery that takes you from point A to point Z before you know it and teaches you something along the way. Even though I'm sure he's not too popular with the Vatican, I hope Brown keeps it up."
5,Pins and Needles,Definitely had me on the edge of my seat. The author really does his homework. I like the historical angle. Interesting as well as exciting. A big five stars for this one.
1,Pure rot...,"Dan Brown is laughing all the way to bank. I find it remarkable that so many who have read this book are stumbling all over themselves to believe every word. The author has taken snatches of history, outlandish theories and spun a tale that reads as truth. Anyone who knows art history and Christian history will see this book for what it is - pure garbage. Read it , laugh out loud and then chuck it in the waste pail."
5,Unbelievable Book,"There is no question that everybody should read this book. It is very entertaining and full of very peculiar facts (assuming that they are true). The writer skilfully turns religious history (highly sensitive and mostly boring subject to read) into a page turning thriller. I highly recommend it.I have a general advise though, make sure that you read it on a weekend, as you will not be able to put it down. I read it on a business trip with near disastrous consequences."
2,Disappointed,"Be warned, Brown spends this entire book bashing Christians and everything they hold dear. He simply makes up a bunch of anti-Christian propaganda and presents it as fact."
5,One of The Best Books I've Ever Read,"In addition to being just a good old fun and exciting mystery novel, this book is extremely enlightening as well. It provides an in-depth look at the history of Christianity and many secret societies that still exist today. It also explains how through centuries of propaganda, many ancient pagan rituals and symbols for life and beauty were misconstrued and demonized by the early church in order to convert the masses. If you are looking to read a book that is impossible to put down, and also learn a thing or two in the process, The Da Vinci Code is for you."
3,"A good read, a little too slick","With all of the hype about this book I was drawn to see for myself. It is a good muder-mystery book and the author does point out some interesting aspects of famous icons. The story moves very fast which keeps your interest. I found however that there was too many ""leaps of faith"" in some of the links suggested and some answers were so obvious that the character's failure to spot it must be an obvious device to draw out the story a little more.A thoroughly enjoyable book but just a wee bit too slick in parts."
3,How awkward,"I got a few pages into the da vinci code when i realized i wassupremely annoyed at the writing style. I mean sure the information is interesting, but the format of 3 lines of conversation followed by 'Sophia knew that...' and jumping into a paragraph of internal explanation. It's not even presented as internalized thought. The book would of been much more interesting if it had taken place as a conversation, rather than a bunch of factual (or semi-facutal) asides. I gave it three stars for the info alone. I also agree with the Eco quote in another comment. A similar one is the Law of Fives. The Law of Fives states simply that: All things happen in Fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of Five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5. substitute Mary M. for Five and you've got the da vinci code."
3,"Entertaining enough, but way too much hype!","Two people who know that I have an aversion to reading, ""what everyone else is reading"" recommended the Da Vinci Code to me. They assured me that, despite all the frenzy surrounding the book, it was great!I did read it, and while I read it quickly because something about it did capture my attention, I did not really enjoy it. I thought it was a clever way for Dan Brown to communicate the massive amount of information he obtained while researching the book, however, I really felt that the book was quite weak. I think Dan Brown has seen how well John Grisham has done in turning mediocre books into blockbusters and decided he should get in on the action as well. He even describes the main character as resembling Harrison Ford.The book was entertaining enough for me to finish it, but I wish I had borrowed it from a friend or the library instead of purchasing it."
4,"Da Vinci Code, a work of leonardo's art","The Da Vinci Code was the eqivelent of a fishing hook to a fish. I could not let go because of the tempting chapters that lead smoothly into the next. It found an amazing work of fact and fiction, fusing both into an entertaining story. Sometimes you may be lost when several new characters are introduced but they all have in some way an effect on the story. The ending was completly unexpected and many of the characters were two faced, with other purposes then what they originaly potray. Dan Brown has tied entertainment into myth and religion, an amazing plot that keeps a person guessing"
5,Great Book!,One of the best books I have read in the last few years. The only people who won't like it are those who believe the Bible is fact. This is a thought provoking book and was great entertainment.
2,Page Turning Plot That's Thin On Character,"If you're looking for a page turning can't wait to see what happens next beach read, this may be the book for you. The story is of a Harvard symbologist who aids a French cryptologist in uncovering clues her murdered Grandfather has left behind in the works of Leonardo DaVinci.Plot supersedes character development, which seems to work in the first half of the book, but as I got closer towards the end it felt like stock cardboard cut outs delivering rather stilted dialogue. Still, it's an interesting and entertaining premise even if it doesn't always succeed in execution"
4,"Not what I expected, I was surprised where this book took me","I found this book to be a quick and compelling read. It is a murder mystery that links events in the novel back to early Christian church events in an unusual way. If you are overly-senstive to controversial issues around Christianity this book may not be for you. If you like to explore ideas surrounding the historical context of religion and art you may enjoy it as I did. My only regret was that I was reading this on a plane, and I would have prefered to have internet access to examine some of the works of art that were being discussed as I was reading!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,Quite simply put this is a fictional story designed to cast doubt on the TRUE word of GOD... The Bible. Don't waste your time or money...
1,A reader from Michigan is a BIG LIAR!!!,A reader from Michigan is so full of crud. Not a freakin thing in this book is true. He's a big liar. He didn't research it. The liar. This book sux and you really shouldn't read this load of cr@p!
2,forget the abridged audio,"whether this book is as good or bad as some reviewers write, what is probably at least as interesting as the plot line is all of the esoteric information presented by the author. (i infer this from the reviews) the audio abridges too much of this and gives the skeleton of clues and lots of running around. read the book or wait for an unabridged audio."
4,More than just a page-turner,"Yes, this is a fun, fast pager-turner murder mystery, but much more. The elements of the Holy Blood mystery are all laid out here in easily digestable form. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the author is making this up, he's not. You could even look at this book as simply a vehicle for bringing the Holy Blood, Holy Grail mystery to a wider audience. I am surprised no one else mentioned this. Read also Holy Blood, Holy Grail by Baigent et al for a more ""non-fiction"" treatment of this subject.P.S. - The author cleverly uses the names ""Sauniere,"" ""Sophie/Sofia"" and ""Bezu"" for main characters in this novel; names that figure into the real mystery.P.P.S. - Yes, I know that a lot of HBHG has been debunked but there are still a lot of threads to follow and a lot of references to real historical events."
4,Symbols and More,"Have you ever left a movie, limp, exhausted and just wrung out? Were you on the edge of your seat the whole time? The Da Vinci Code left me that way. Everytime I relaxed a little, ""Okay, they made it through THAT crisis"", up would come another.Author Dan Brown takes his major characters, symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu through a harrowing search/journey that leaves you with more information than you probably want to know about art history, symbolism, ancient religions, cults, architecture and much more.Although the flashbacks are too long, wordy and at times intrusive, the plot, the use of modern technology and the sheer speed of the action make this a book you will find hard to put down."
2,Don't expect much depth or coherence,"This is the first fiction I have purchased in years and the shallow quality of this writing reinforced my purchase ethics. Characters were so thin and undeveloped as to be cartoonish, the 'clues' and 'connections' seemed to have been chosen by lottery and gooped together in silly ways, from whatever stack of notes was handy, ordinner conversations remembered. This is the last time I fall for the media hype....I heard this book recommended on NPR I think, so I was truly shocked when it turned out to be sloppy rather than a well crafted conspiracy tale. It was however, a delightful revisit to the Louvre galleries and Westminster Abbey's hallowed halls, crypts and floor tombs."
3,This is no Name of the Rose,"This is fundamentally a chase-scene thriller book, dressed up in codes and ciphers, ancient conspiracy theories, scavenger hunts, and a lot of silly stuff. As such, it's an ok beach read. But those reviewers who say this is the new Name of the Rose (or even a rich mystery) are exaggerating."
1,Stretched too far,"This story is beyond believable and not particularly well written. There are so many hints at things to come; the reader is left hanging just too many times. There are too many long explanations of historical events, theories, art. The main characters continue to be chased by the police, like some Hollywood concoction. All that is missing is a car chase. The storyline is so convoluted that I felt I could not take another twist or explanation. To be honest, I cannot finish the book."
1,The worst written bestseller I have ever read,"I couldn't finish it. The farther I read, the more shallow the characters became, the more clunky the writing and storytelling got. I started skimming halfway through, and then even that seemed like a waste of time.It sits on a shelf right now, 1/4 unread.I don't know what the attraction is. I really don't."
2,Learn to Write,"This editors / publishers of this book should be ashamed of themselves. The pointlessly long book is in drastic need of editing and the author should take a course in English composition so he can write chapters longer than 1 page and distance himself from the ""stunning"", ""frozen"", ""wrenching"" school of writing, a sure sign of laziness on the part of an author unable to forge his own style."
5,I can't stop talking about this book !!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! It was a firstDan Brown for me and certainly won't be my last. After reading it, I immediately ordered a copy to be shipped to two of my out of town friends, insisting they read it. This book is so entertaining and so thought provoking. I found every word to be SO interesting and could not put it down. The story was fast paced and exciting, but I especially loved all of the factual stuff in it. I was online immediately, excitedly looking up the works of art, math facts and the religious societies the book discusses. I haven't been so excited about recommending a book in a long time. This is a great book, no matter what your reading taste is. Truly a book for everyone. Thank you Dan Brown."
2,It's OK reading if you're stuck at an airport...,"Which is why I bought this book. It does have a strong start, and at first, I thought that it was going to be very good. But, the self-conscious writing style, the short chapters (which give the book a newspaper feel), the annoying habit the author has of obviously withholding information, and the awkward dialogue combine to make this a very tedious read. In fact, I lost interest about halfway through.....just about the time my plane was ready to board.If you're curious about this book, wait for the paperback."
3,I can see the movie already,"If you like John Grisham novels, then you'll like Da Vinci Code. It moves at breakneck speed and keeps you in suspense, and it really is a good ride, but then like Grisham novels, it sorta falls apart at the end. The unlikely turn of events in the last part of the book will leave many groaning, especially when you find out who the bad guy is and his motivations. If you think really hard about it, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But it's breezy, light reading, so just suspend your disbelief for a while and enjoy what is essentially the book version of a hollywood thriller."
1,groan,"This book is awful, simply awful. I glanced back at some of the other customer reviews, and I am incredulous that some readers think this is a good thriller. The characters are ridiculous and without any resemblance to real people. The plot is ludicrous from beginning to end, in too many ways to even list. Suspense? How can you care after the first hundred pages of this never-ending chase? Some reviewers complain about the concocted history that underpins the plot, while others try to justify it as ""hey, it's fiction, whatever he wants to put in is okay."" Sorry, but The Da Vinci Code doesn't even make it as a competent story.As for the book's research, it's too pathetic to be an ""indictment"" of Christianity. More like an indictment of the author. The book this most reminds me of is ""Chariots of the Gods"" -- the same kind of loony fabrications."
4,The Fugitive meets Indiana Jones meets The Omen,"I really wanted to give this book a five star rating, but was slightly disappointed with the ending. Not the ending I would have chosen, but then again I am not writing the book. Very good read. Chapters set-up for moving along at a fast pace. Characters were very good and interesting. I have 18 years of Catholic School education and did not find any of the subject matter disturbing. This is a work of fiction, the author has the right to make whatever conclusions he wants. The societies described in the book do exist. Every society has deviantcharacters and monsters, this does not make an entire society bad. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Indiana Jones, touch of the Fugitive (innocent man seemed to be framed)and the Omen. This book did make me wonder about the societies talked about. Went on Yahoo and did some research, very interesting. Good read for the summer."
5,And I learned stuff too!,"This book was one not to put down. It was the first of Dan Brown's books I have read, and I guarantee it will not be the last. The way in which the author weaves in facts and historical theories is amazing. I enjoyed the story and learned a lot too. Perhaps Mr. Brown should try writing texts books, I guarentee students would retain a lot more knowledge if he did!"
1,Amateur hour,I couldn't make it past chapter three.This has to be the worst written book i've ever read.The dialogue is especially awful.Dan Brown has absolutely no idea how people really talk.How this book got to be such a big seller is beyond me.Go read some Alan Furst or Robert Wilson instead.
2,not satisfied,"I ordered the new copy of novel, but they sent me the used one, though it is in decent condition, they should have mentioned it on ad as used instead of new"
4,The perfect BB'S,"this book is great but it didn't fill the expectations that I hoped. I thought this lagged the thrill of finding the grail you have a century to find it it's not like its goinganywhere except that they moved it to france. The ""Angles and Demons"" was acually exciting because they actually had to find a bomb in this time period. I likethat Robert Langdon always get the young girls not the girls that arehisage it makes him seem more like a man. At the end of the story he always getss the girl or talks to a girl like Cane in CSI Miami it really makes me feel good becausethat older guy gets the younger girl. Thankyou for that because then you think is he going t get the girl then at the end he gets her and I'm like I knew it so it makes mefeel good and he always gets out of there. That is my review for ""Davinci Code."" I always like getting the hot girls so I put myself inhis shoes because of her BB! That's what im talking about!!!!"
3,"Entertaining...like a movie, but NOT quality literature","Dan Brown lacks all of those qualities that set the greatest authors of novels (both contemporary and classical) apart from writers in general. However, he may just contain those qualties that are conspicuous in the writers of prime time television shows, and action movies. The novel does entertain, and also contains some interesting historical facts, but the writing style, or lack of it, is what leaves me with a negative impression. I did give it three stars because I think Brown created exactly what he wanted in this novel. What we are left with is a very marketable book, with few memorable qualities... similar to much of our pop culture. But if you can understand what I mean when I say that Scarface was a better movie and Coetzee's ""Disgrace"" was a better book, you might also understand why the DaVinci code is really not worth the time."
1,"Bad writing, plot and history...at least it's consistent","I admit it, I read this book because of the hype. I expected a deep book, with careful research.What I got was a book of tin-foil hat conspiracies, weakly intertwined and excruciatingly thin characters. The characters only exist to move along his poorly executed plot.Dan Brown is a bad writer. Worse, he's a lazy researcher. I have no idea why this book is a best-seller.It's impossible to care about any of the characters. The plot is full of holes and improbabilities. He makes amazing omissions. He goes on through the entire book about how the church wanted to minimize women by limiting the role of Mary Magdeline, but avoids ever talking about Mother Mary.It has an utterly predictable hollywood ending.The most laughable thing about this BADLY written book it that people are now going around quoting its psuedo-history and made up theology as facts."
5,Great Thriller,"Tell me, who doesn't love a captivating book? A book that keeps you turning the page in earnest to know what happens next? This is just that type of book. I've read it twice, and will read it again.Dan Brown amazes me with his powerful ability to twist fact and fiction to create his masterpieces. As in his book Angels & Demons, Brown shows off his talent using historical information to create an amazing adventure, leaving me mystified and enlightened. With a delightful twist ending, I find myself wanting to read the book all over again. Through his characters' eyes, I'm able to grasp the brilliance and breath-taking power of historical art with a new appreciation and understanding."
5,Could't even sleep while reading this book!!!,"This is by far one of the best new books on my bookshelf. While i am a christian and do not agree with all that is put in this book i know it is just that, a book. Not someones ploy to convert me to another religion but just simply a wonderful read to be enjoyed but thousands of people. Thank you dan brown for this and all of your other wonderful books!!!"
2,It's no masterpiece,"Why has this been so popular? As far as thriller plots go, it's mediocre and rather farfetched. The characters are two-dimensional. The writing style is not the least bit creative or literary. The accounts of religious and art history are spurious. The puzzles and word games provide entertaining diversions, but they don't outweigh the book's other deficiencies. In straddling several genres, the book has apparently attracted a broad readership. (The religious controversy it stirred up didn't hurt either.) But I doubt that many have walked away thrilled.For a monastic literary mystery, try The Name of the Rose. For simple excitement, go for something like Michael Crichton or Harry Potter. But don't bother with this."
1,buyer beware,"Alexander Pope once said ""a little learning can be a dangerous thing."" How true that is. Like others, including Oliver Stone, Brown has taken a few interesting bits of historical information mixed with some out-right fabrication and attempted to form a conspiracy of sorts, involving the Catholic Church and among others: Constantine, Mary Magdalene, Victor Hugo, Leonardo da Vinci and even Walt Disney.The trouble, of course, with this kind of fast and loose investigation in which the presumption that because A follows b then b must have caused a, is that it more often than not leads to mistaken conclusions.Ah, but this is a work of fiction, you say. That does not seem to be the message that Mr. Brown is spreading as he markets his novel. I suppose that the belief that this nonsensical pulp could be based on reality is essential to sales. So let that old caveat ""buyer beware"" continue to be your warning."
5,Pageturner!,"I bought this book for a friends birthday gift, he called me the day he got it to thank me. The next day he called to say he finished the book because he could not put it down. He refered to it as a ""pageturner"". The only book he has ever read that he did not put down once! I think I might ask for it back!!!"
4,Great,"I enjoyed this book a lot, not just for the illustrations, but the manuscript as well. The pictures showing the various paintings was very helpful. They would have been very helpful in Angels and Demons, had I know that it came illustrated."
2,Regarding the Da Vinci Code,"Some books have to be read because they are canon, and there are others which must be engaged for the simple, solitary reason that one will be pestered to death by their friends, family members and a multitude of outright strangers until they have done so. The Da Vinci Code, a cheap, popular, and ultimately predictable thriller, is, of course, one of the most famous contemporary examples of the latter group. While it may be utterly expendable, it is, at the same time, more enjoyable than I would like to admit when taken at face value."
1,Proof,"This book is simply proof that the Truths of the One Religion, the Holy Catholic Church, with the One God it loves and promotes, will and must endure attacks from those that hate it throughout the ages to the End. This fiction history is nothing more than a re-surfacing of the third century attack on Christ's Divinity, known then (and now) as the HERESY OF ARIANISM. But, those whose faith is strong and foundations firm will not be troubled by this version of 21st Century anti-Christian nonsense."
1,did not live up to the hype,"ridiculous story/plot, do not understand what all the fuss was a about. i would not recommend davinci code to anyone"
3,"Oh, puhleeeese","There is no doubt that this is a good read - fast paced with intrigue and lots of red herrings. However, I cannot understand why it has attained cult status and why so many people want to ""believe"". Knowing even a little about history and a little critical thinking will put this novel where it belongs, strictly in the realm of fiction. Enjoy it for what it is. Don't read into it any more than a good story."
1,"""Outside, the wind howled through the trees.""","Come on, people. ""Stupid"" doesn't necessarily equate ""Fun"".Aside from the fact that the credibility of this book has been consistently trashed by scholars, the writing is poor to the point that it would be laughed out of a high school English class.I'm wondering if there should be a required ""What was the last book you read?"" question, for amazon reviewers. I have a hunch the majority of these five star ratings would also include a lot of Danielle Steele and Stephen King."
2,Much ado about nothing,"So I finally read this novel just to see what all the hullabaloo was about. I am at a loss to explain all the hype! I didn't care for this book at all. The authors' writing style isn't high quality, the story itself is implausible and I found myself completely indifferent to the characters. I just don't understand what all the excitement is about."
5,THE TRUTH AGAINST ROME,"There is more to THE DA VINCI CODE than meets the eye. Disguisedas a mystery-novel, THE DA VINCI CODE makes public the suppressedhistory of the bloodline of The Holy Grail [The Desposyni]persecuted down through their generations by a threatenedImperial Rome & then by a threatened Church of Rome up to thisvery day. I highly recommend this book for those in search ofTHE TRUTH. Thank you Dan Brown for writing THE DA VINCI CODE!!!Postscript: the PRIORY OF SION, composed of the REX DEUS-families whose Inner Circle is THE DESPOSYNI, is the forerunner& parent order of THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS who are the guardians ofthe bloodline of Jesus (Yeshua) & Mary Magdalene and its history.--Gregory Thompson (MacTavish)"
5,"For puzzle, numbers, and mystery lovers","This is the best book I have read in a long time! I loved the way Brown intertwines a great mystery thriller with puzzles and history. From page 1, this is a page-turner. I had to keep forcing myself to put it down to get anything else done. I recommend this to people who love puzzles, number, history, and mysteries. Don't be scared off by the religious themes - the possibilities explored in this book are fantastic and well worth the journey."
3,Highly overrated,"This book should have been a screen play. It would (or will) be a blockbuster movie, but the book lags, the characters are cardboard, and the plot development is uninteresting. However, the ideas and history behind the book are exciting. I had neither considered many of the symbols in art history before nor have I thought that the holy grail might be a person and not the cup of Christ.This is a quick read, but the writing quality isn't good enough to make this a classic."
3,A gripping read and a shallow story,"Ok, I'll admit it, I couldn't put it down! Honestly, from page one you're there - following Langdon everywhere. There's no way that you'll stop until it's all over and then you'll wish it wasn't! That's that kind of book. Aside from this,however, this book has no artistic value at all. Brown is a new Sidney Sheldon, that's all. Well... the new Sidney Sheldon who wans to be Umberto Eco but he can't.Recommended for a light, afternoon read."
2,"Creatively constructed puzzles, not much else","The author has wrapped the highly bogus ""Mary Magdalene and Jesus were lovers"" tale around a generic thriller plot. Other reviewers have catalogued that all too well here to go into detail. Suffice it to say that some of the scenes would fit well in the next Austin Powers movie. Hairy-legged feminists and other Christian-haters may enjoy this book. The rest of you should not waste your money. Fortunately Mel Gibson's new movie, The Passion, is coming out soon to tell the real story of Jesus."
4,Great thriller!,"I was glad that Dan Brown decided to come out with a ""Special Edition"" with pictures. It made the reading a bit easier (Easier to picture the place/views in my head). I really enjoyed this book. And would highly recommed it. I can't wait till the sequel comes out!"
2,Fast paced pap,"Well! Dan Brown sure has written a successful book, hasn't he? Best seller for many weeks. This book is eye candy. Discerning readers among you, you know what I mean. I read it in a day.But don't kid yourself. This book isn't researched, or in any way accurate in the details. It's a plot spun, interestingly enough, around little kernels of sketchy 'information'. Just FORGET about Constantine's role in the canonization of Scripture! Dan Brown should be ashamed of himself for suggesting he's done good research. Now if you want to read a better source for all of this, I suggest books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail or The Woman with the Alabaster Jar, or better, The Feminine Face of God."
5,An riveting book,"I think the reviews of this book are almost as entertaining as the book itself, although they took a lot longer to read. This is an excellent pulling together of both fact and fiction. The factual aspects of the book, those that deal with the historical Jesus and the inner workings of the various churches and secret societies, are interesting enough to demand a read. Interwoven with it, however, is an enticing mystery story set in the modern world of politics and power. OPEN YOUR MIND when you read the book, and, if you choose, do your own research. The journey will be startling and very much worth it!"
2,"Interesting topic, pedestrian writing","I enjoy thrillers, and have more than a passing interest in history and theology. But this book was tough to finish -- the writing is pedestrian at best, and truly awful in places. Clich√©s abound. I'm a technical writer, and it disturbs me that such a poorly-written book has ascended to the top of the best-seller lists."
2,Long slow read - and can be confusing,"I just could not ""get into"" this book. I enjoyed the history and ""facts or fiction"". I can't figure out why it has received all the hype - I guess because it attacks the Catholic church and religious history. I agree with others - borrow if you want to read - don't waste your money."
1,how to make money with a book,"rewrite the work of a few others into one book: richard leigh, michael baigent, henry lincoln and their research (namely _holy blood, holy grail_); umberto eco's _foucault's pendulum_ has murders and museums and templars and most of the rest of _da vinci code_; lynn picknett's _the templar revelation_ gives us the da vinci connection. and ALL of these books are written better."
1,Catholic Slander,This book slander's the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is known for respecting other religions yet still remains the target for evil propagation such as this. I will never buy a book written by Dan Brown again.
1,Yeah it is fiction but...,The author keeps on insisting that it is based on fact. His references have been debunked over and over again by real bonified scholars. Besides all that. The writing is 3rd rate.It seems this forum is being used by authors to push their own work. Buyer beware!
1,A big let down,"Expecting a crisp, intelligent read, I found one dimensional characters and very weak dialouge. The protaganist was the weakest of all the characters. A ""must put down"" and forget about it book. I would have rated the book no stars if I had the chance."
5,DaVinci Code,I loved the book!!! The combination of suspense and historicalfacts made in so interesting and entertaining. Someday this will be one #1 hit movie too.
3,Mind candy for the brain,"An entertaining quick read, though I think it'll end up making a better movie than it did a book. The mechanics of plotting could have been smoother, and the book would have been better had I just been allowed to read the author's cleverness for myself without the characters telling me over and over again how clever he was. That became distracting early on."
4,The Truth Revealed,"I loved the Da Vinci Code. Any truly serious biblical scholar has to accept many a premiss put forth therein. If you have read 'New Testament Revelations of Jesus of Nazareth' and/or 'What Happens After You Die' (two books which contain many of the messages received by James Padgett between 1914 and 1923 via automatic writings from Jesus and other Celestial and historical characters,) you will be very at home much of what is written in the Da Vinci Code. The debunking of the Trinity, the Virgin Birth, and Jesus as God was all revealed to James Padgett over 75 years ago by those who were there. Mary Magdalene wrote as did Mary the Mother of Jesus. Jesus himself wrote Padgett of his true mission on earth. As a Christian minister I can happily recommend all the above."
5,A must read for all open minded individuals,"WOW, this has to be the best Novel that I have ever picked up. It has a great story yes and it has taken me on a journey through history with an introduction to facts that has challenged a lot of the things that I have been taught growing up. I could not put this book down and eventually when i did put the book down I found myself picking it up again. This novel is more than a suspense thriller, its a history novel told aboard a very intriguing story....its a must read"
1,Don't waste you time on this book,"It's sad that trees died for this book.Bad high school level writing, lame made-for-TV plot, public knowlege ""secrets"", completely predictable ending.I give it a less than one star rating if I could."
2,Re-define 'Bestseller',"Like many other people, I bought this book simply out of curiousity. It appears to have made many waves and since I am interested in the history of Religion I thought it would make an interesting read. Far from it.The characters are flat and one-dimension and the whole book is based on the so-called 'secrets' Brown reveals. Without the information on the history of the church (though their accuracy is debateable) the fact that the storyline is completely lacking would have been blaringly obvious. But even so, he obviously trusts that all his readers are as dense and uniformed on the subject matter as his character Sophie. Rather, I found myself laughing out loud every time it took Langdon and Leigh forever to figure out a 'riddle' I, the layman, had solved within seconds. Not to mention that the 'revolutionary' ideas portrayed by Brown are hardly new. I had heard most of this before at one point or another.I should hope that everyone takes this book with a pound of salt."
2,No Big Whoop.,"Ordinarily, if I read a thriller like this I would not find the need to comment on it. However, there has been way too many accolades heaped upon a book that, while interesting, is poorly written, has cartoonish characters, and a simplistic plot.I can only surmise that some people ""love"" this book more for its fictional hypothesis than for any literary merit. And I'm not judging it by high-brow standards. Mr. Brown simply does not write as well as some of his contemporaries within the same genre.Mr. Brown does, however, have a finely-tuned ear. An ear that is able to pick up on the desire for people to re-write history to jibe with current sociological trends. This is fictional religious history for the ""girls kick ass!"" crowd. I suspect that Mr. Brown, in all honesty, wrote this book with more of an eye towards the ""almighty dollar"" than the ""sacred feminine.""In which case, this book is a resounding success. What was it that PT Barnum said about suckers?"
3,In search of the Holy Grail,"This book is certainly filled with all the twists and turns, plots and subplots, and strange alliances which make it a page-turning best-seller. The murder of a museum curator occurs in the Louvre during the first chapter. As the man is dying, he leaves a series of convoluted clues which his granddaughter Sophie and an historical symbologist named Robert Landgon, spend the rest of the book trying to follow. What is their objective? The Holy Grail, which is given a different spin in this book. While there are historical rumors about the nature of the Grail, not as the chalice used by Christ at the Last Supper but as something quite different, this book's fictional plot is based on shaky conjecture. It is well-written and the plots weaves deliciously around so that yesterday's allies are today's enemies. Despite its strengths, this book is on shaky ground and it was hard for me, as a Christian, to accept the basic premise."
2,If they make a movie it ought to be a Saturday serial,There is a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter and computer generated characters will be more than adequate to cope with characters' emotional depths.Any really good heresy is an old heresy. Mr. Brown has done a lot of research and it's the arcana that are interesting. Wish he had skipped the novel and written a popular history of the Council(s) of Nicaea and how the heresies dealt with there have persisted.
2,Not a literay classic by any means!,"I read the book several years ago soon after publication and before all the hype and hoopla. The theories Brown presents are intriguing and thought provoking and are the only reason I managed to finish the book. However, I was very bored with the sophomoric writing style, the flat one-dimensional characters and the way the events just fell into place, very scripted. But to give credit where credit is due, Brown was did a good job of weaving the ""theories"" into the story other than that, the book lacked depth."
1,A waster of money and paper,"I was expecting much more from this book considering the hype surrounding it. Pulp fiction novels and paperback romances have significantly more substance and style. Written to be made into a movie, this book suffers from ""public education"" command of the language, poor character development and bulk beyond the climax that seems to satisfy contractual obligations rather than contribute to the plot. I never met a conspiracy theory I did not like, but this book goes beyond entertaining speculation in its quest for twisted grandeur. You can do much better looking elsewhere."
3,THE DA VINCI DISSAPPOINTMENT,"I WAS ABSOLUTELY HOOKED ON THIS BOOK FOR THE FIRST HALF. I THOUGHT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET SOCIETIES, THE GRAIL, MASONS, ETC. WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING. SOMEWHERE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK, I BECAME PUZZLED, CONFUSED AND ULTIMATELY LET DOWN. THE PLOT WOUND DOWN TO A SOMETHING SILLY AND CONTRIVED. THE CHARACTERS WERE NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED SO I FELT NOTHING FOR THEM. IF SOMEONE ASKED ME TODAY, 5 MONTHS AFTER READING IT, HOW DID IT END? I COULDN'T TELL THEM.STRONG START, BELLY FLOP ENDING."
1,really bad cliche driven tripe,"A nice story idea, but so so badly executed. He tries to create a sense of high drama by resorting to hyperbole. His characters swing from sullen, to grinning, to suspicious to astounded over basically nothing, all within the same two sentences. Over and over again. This is a new low. The worst book I've ever read."
2,the irony,"Mr. Brown uses the very same tactics that he suggests the Catholic church has used over the centuries to mislead the world. By mixing fiction with a little fact he has managed to challenge what many have accepted as the truth, but it would be giving Brown too much credit to suggest that this is what he meant to do with this book--to illustrate that irony.As far as the writing goes it is a fast, often annoying read. Mr. Brown loves adjectives to the point of redundancy. Here are some I would use to describe The Da Vinci Code: shallow, wooden, uninspired, trite, and clunky."
1,A ho hum read,"I found this book to be a ho-hum read. It never captured my interest. It is so full of tired old literary tricks that I found annoying. One technique I found particularly annoying is the extreme overuse of non-English phrases and definitions within the first few pages. I suppose the author (and many readers) found that to be sophisticated and ""learned."" Also, the whole premise is so obviously controversial while claiming to be ""just a good thriller"" that it's obvious the author has some personal issues with Christianity. But I suppose it'll be just a matter of months before a major TV network makes it a ""movie of the week."" Not very original at all but B-O-R-I-N-G."
1,Dan Brown's crimes,"I will be brief, for there are plenty of reviews which you can read here that I completely agree with.This is an extraordinarily bad book, for any number of reasons you may imagine. It is, quite possibly, one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is so simple, bad, awkward, and cliched, it is (quite literally) painful to read it. After I did, I felt like I needed a shower.I prefer not to think that it was a great bestseller, and what that means for today's culture and people's level of general literacy. And I also prefer to forget that it was recommended to me by some people I otherwise respect.Do yourself a favour: stay away from this book. Just about any other book would do much better."
4,A meeting in Paris,i never read anything by Brown before. the book was loaned to me by a co-worker. it was difficult to put down. i kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. it was exciting and captured me right away. i enjoyed the book so much that i'm buying another book of Dan Brown's. i like his style. i liked the way he developed the characters and gave you just a little along the way. just as the two main characters were discovering why the murder happened we discover more about them. i hope to see those two cahracters again in a story.
3,Good but overrated,"This is a good FICTION/MYSTERY, but all the hype it has recieved really baffles me. This is a fun read, but you probably won't have any profound realizations in reading this (unless you have never heard any of the history or theory surrounding the christian church). This is not a book I will read again, but if you want a book which will absorb you, without making you think too much (and will just be FUN) then this one is great."
3,Can't get past the first 50 pages,This is one book I am having a hard tme reading. Think I will try to continue reading and maybe will stick with it.
4,Page Turning Mystery,"Mr. Brown's book is a high paced action mystery thriller. It is obviously written for mass market digestion, as he uses effusive foreshadowing that allows the reader to figure out the solutions to the plots and subplots well in advance of Brown revealing them. However, the book is great fun to read.When evaluating detective/mystery books, I always try to compare them to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books, which really are the only books in this genre that I feel are truly literature in the classic sense. Brown's book does not live up to that literary test, but it does live up to most other tests of what readers would consider a good read.If you enjoy page turning mystery with a theological theme, this is truly a wonderful read."
2,Silly puerile premise,Didn't like this book at all. It accepted as fact preposterous notions that have been for the most part totally discredited. If you believe in conspiracies this book may be for you. Whatever you do don't accept all that's written at face value.
3,An Umberto Eco wanna-be,"Brown has a long way to go until he reaches the class of Eco. If you have read any of Eco's books and expect a similar nail biter, this is not it. If you have never read Eco and like historical thrillers, you will probably enjoy the book, as long as you do expect historical facts."
1,Preposterous,"Dan Brown can come up with a decent story, but his writing skills leave MUCH to be desired. A third-grader could read this mess."
4,illustrated heaven,Since I won't be able to go see the places in person. I thought that this would be one way to see them. Also great story too.
3,Entertaining But Silly,"I have to give Brown credit as a mystery writer--he does keep the pages turning; however, the Da Vinci Code is one of the most overrated books of the year, and certainly not one of Brown's better efforts.One of the most disappointing features of this book was his repeated representation of fiction as fact. Was he deliberately misleading or was this simply the result of sloppy research? The only reason I suspect the former was that, in his conclusion, he seemed to accept the veracity of the ""sacred feminine"" nonsense, along with all of the other attendant (and unoriginal) puerilities."
1,The Da Vinci Code,"While the book's plot and characters are well-developed, Brown's ""research"" is selective, and--in several instances--incorrect. Caveat emptor."
2,Anyone who knows Paris,Anyone who knows Paris at all knows you don't go down the Champs Elysees from the Louvre to get to the American Embassy. I just stopped reading this book.
3,Better wait for the movie,"I don't remember ever reading a book that would be easier to make into a movie. The characters are so simple, that they don't feel human. It is as if they don't have any opinions - any thoughts they have are flashbacks. They are painted as either good or bad guys and you can't get more movie-like than that.The book got me interested at the beginning. Catholic church conspiracy, secret societies and Da Vinci's role in one of them - seemed interesting and intelligent and I kept on reading hoping to be both challenged and entertained. After the first 100 pages, I got tired. Really, how entertaining is to READ about a car chase?Readers that generally enjoy trillers will probably like this one also. For others I recommend skipping it - don't read it just because everyone else is reading it (like I did)."
1,"Really, what's the fuss?","Dan Brown has made a reported US$250,000,000 from this book so far. Good for him! As a would be writer of fiction I love to see that kind of success. With the recent trial and the soon to be released movie, he'll make even more. More good for him!But am I the only one who thinks the plot of this book is trite and not especially interesting, let alone believable. It is poorly written, badly paced, and frankly boring.But then Dan Brown has made all that money, so there you go."
1,Lies and hate slurs aginst history & religion,"I found this book to be a complete waste of time,money and it was wrote in such a way to let people think it was true by saying that all art work ,architect, religous acts are facts.When not one is and Every thing that stated as a fact in the book by Dan Brown and the characters is a completely fictional.And it was wrote mainly to attack christanity !"
2,poor men ludlum,very interesting historical background whether true or not.. but the plot with all the twists and turns (most of which very predictable) reminded me of ludlum's books which I stopped reading ages ago
5,An all-around amazing book,"The suspense and the riddles made this book fun, but the knowledge it truley contained is why I loved it. Though you have to be openminded to read it, it can truley make you look at things closely and re-consider what you've been told."
3,Good Book but only in fair (if that condition),Great Book - less than average in condition. Would probably not buy from this seller again.
3,quaint,"i had to have a look after all this hype and the book was worse than i feared. the chapters are annoyingly short and end with what are probably supposed to be cliffhangers, but what they do is chop the story into frilly little pieces. Brown's previous Vatican story was much better.The characters are 2D, laden with cliches and damned with a thin plot. Although the book contains a number of clever riddles and juicy historical factoids, the author can never decide whether he is giving a lecture on history, religious iconography and conspiracy theories or whether he is actually writing a thriller. as a result, there are pages and pages of irrelevant stuff while the plot itself is thin and moves at lightning speed.not that i mind the subject topic - in fact, i find Knights Templar, medieval legends, da Vinci et consortes captivating. yet if you are writing a novel, Dan, please write the novel, not a philosophical sermon or a Morality Play.And now I have to imagine Hanks as Langdon <shudder>"
5,Mind Blowing,"This book completely blew my mind. It is not often that I read a novel that had me immediately, after reading the last page, running to my computer to research the secret societies, symbols and other topics of this book. I found it very intriguing and exciting. It is definitely a book that makes you think and I wouldn't consider it a light fast read, although not being able to put it down myself, it didn't take me long to finish it. Definitely one of those books that you wish could last another 300 pages. A MUST READ!!!!"
4,Faith meets Secrecy,"Dan Brown has crafted a good page turner. Though burdened a bit with loads of historical and cryptographic references, it is nonetheless a fairly brisk read. Dragging the reader through breathless chases around Paris and London, the author has obviously done his homework and keeps the reader engaged by cleverly switching through multiple intertwined story lines. I have to admit the identity of the main culprit was rather surprising, but the ending left me a little disappointed. Bringing closure to such a sensitive subject probably makes the chosen ending an obvious conclusion. The questions explored in the novel are not for the religiously narrow minded. Overall, a good work."
1,I'm sorry but has the world gone mad?!,"Why oh why is this book so popular? It's writing is okay, not stellar and not awful, but it's based entirely on a theory that has been around since the 1970s, based on the works of a French conman from the 1950s, which has been derided and laughed at and proved utterly false ever since, but now that it's wrapped in the clothes of a thriller it's being hailed a 'new' and 'exciting' concept? Are these people insane?"
4,Often imitated,This is the book that gave fodder to Pawns of Prophecy and countless other knockoffs. i read this before seeing the movie and was impressed with the vivid descriptions and fast paced action scenes. 4 stars just because of all the hype surrounding it- you can never live up to the hype. A very entertaining novel still- not great but not a moment of regret for reading either.
4,Fascinating!,"With all the controversy surrounding this book when it first came out I wasn't sure I wanted to read it. I am glad I decided to read it now. I have a new found interest in symbols and cryptology. This is not the faith shaking story i was lead to believe but an interesting twist on an age old quest. I couldn't put it down, suspenseful, insightful and compelling."
2,Interesting plot that comes up short,"As with most people who read this book, I got swept up in all the brouhaha about it. The plot was interesting and the few tidbits about symbols kept me reading a bit further, but this book really fell flat in all other areas. The characters are two dimensional with no real depth, most of the information about what the symbols stood for is flat out wrong, and it seemed that the main driving force behind the novel was the notion the Jesus and Mary were married and had a child.Now, I wouldn't mind reading a book that theorized about a wedded Jesus, but this one certainly isn't it. I personally don't believe it happened, but I have heard some valid points for it happening and none of it appear in this book. Sensationalism aside, this book isn't worth the time and there are much better written works out there that are far more rewarding."
4,"even if english is not your first language, you'll be fascinated","First of all, I have to tell you that English is not my first language and that I had been in the U.S for only 5months before I bought this book.At the begining I thought that I would need a dictionnary to understand, but I can guarantee you that it was for no need.I think that I enjoyed it because I've already seen the movie, otherwise I would not enjoy it as I did from the begining to the end.It was a passionate reading, I would definetely recommend it to anyoneEnjoy ;)"
5,The Da Vinci Code,"This book is very cleverly put together, it is unbelievable how well Dan Brown takes the little things that we see and put them together. Anybody and everybody should read this book"
2,Up all night for this?,"A few friends told me that they couldn't put this book down. I couldn't put it down either, but when I finally did finish it, I was pretty disappointed. I found some of the clues to be transparent , almost insulting. I am so DONE with the 0h-look-we've-fallen-in-love-while-chasing-crime/rescuing-the-world thing. Please."
3,Ruined,"This fine book was ruined for me from the first. Dan Brown should have been told that Da Vinci is not a part of Leonardo's name, but only signifies his city of origin. To refer to Leonardo simply as Da Vinci is a serious misnomer which succeeded in spoiling the story for me."
2,Ho Hum,"I had expected a better written book after reading the glowing reviews. The story is fast-paced and exciting at first, but it soon got predictable. Nonetheless, I give credit to the author, for his imaginative ideas. But! do not doubt that this is a poorly written book. It could/should have been better."
3,Indiana Jones for nerds,"When my daughter asked me what this book was like, I thought ""Indiana Jones for nerds"" was an apt description. The main character is even described as looking like Harrison Ford. Regardless, this is a fast paced story, helped along by short chapters. There are some really eye opening historical facts discussed in this novel, so much that I want to read more on this subject. So, in summary, the story itself is great, but I felt the writing style of the author was a little melodramatic. If you can get past that ""over the top"" style, you will enjoy this book."
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"I finished this book yesterday, but I was ready to write a review about half-way through. I loved this book and could not put it down. I have always enjoyed a good murder-mystery, but this book far exceeded my expectations. I had no idea what I was walking into when I started reading Dan Brown.I learned so much. I kept looking back toward the first page that says FACT: and goes on to list the organizations, artwork, architecture, documents and secreat rituals in this novel are real and described accurately.I am recommending this book to everyone that I know. Not only was I learning a new and factual way to look at our history throughout the entire story, the suspense of the murder-mystery wouldn't allow me to put this novel down.You will not be disappointed."
2,Awesome book,Awseome book. I loved the explantion of history and how there is a lot more to the christian religion then meets the eye. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and I will definetly look for more books that cover the subjects brought up in this story.
4,Super Book,This book was so interesting. I learned a lot and it was a book you can really get into. I have read all of Dan Brown's books because this one was so good. A must-read for anyone.
1,Don't waste your time,Dan Brown must be the most OVER-RATED author in history. Seriously.This piece of trash is only good for kindling.
2,Christianity protected by ... pagans?,"Written to be a page turner with a lot of twists and turns. Halfway through the book, I was thinking to myself ""Holy Grail Batman, another riddle. Do you think The Riddler's behind this?""So I got to the end of the book and find out what the Holy Grail is (don't worry, I won't spoil it). But basically there is this Holy Grail, a long sought after treasure from Jesus Christ, who started Christianity. This Holy Grail, for over 2000 years, has been kept safe and protected by a group of pagans? Wow, what a revelation, pagans protecting Christianity. This book should be more of a shock to the ACLU than to the Catholic Church."
2,If Opus Dei ruled the world,"Finally, I decided to pick up this novel after hearing about all the controversy it caused. It's an interesting read, to be sure, and the opening scene where Langdon and Neveu escape from the heavily guarded Louvre Museum in Paris is excellent. It's the rest of the book I can't get into. The premise is that the murder of a priest is somehow connected to Neveu and her family being the descendents of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene and a secret society within the Catholic Church wants to prevent that knowledge from getting into the open. I can see where taking liberties with Jesus' family tree might offend some traditionalist Catholics but, honestly, if I were Catholic I'd be far more offended by the pedophile priest scandals than this book. I tried reading Brown's novel ""Deception Point"" and had the same problem. It starts of pretty good, then descends into boring territory and I stop reading."
2,"Stilted language, inelegant writing, great marketing agent","My husband and mother-in-law raved about this book, so I plodded through it, but found the language stilted...it read like a bad romance novel to me. I found his writing embarassing. If you are looking for great literature, pass on this. If Barbara Cartland is your hero, have at it."
5,SUCH A THRILLER.,This book was so thrilling and I couldn't put it down once I started it. It was so amazing how Dan Brown made all the codes fit in. Very very GOOD!!
3,Not up to the hype. It's only a page turner...,"...because Brown ends chapters in the middle, without rhyme or reason.It's a chick book. No...a guilt-ridden Catholic girl chick book.Brown knows his stuff. The factoids are very interesting, but he front-loads the book with them. It's entertaining and full of rich detail for the first half. But, if you haven't figured out the plot's direction by then, you haven't been paying attention.A good book for the beach for those with lowered expectations who have been drinking.Can't wait for the movie (sic)."
1,Doesn't live up to its namesake,"I picked this book up with no knowledge about it; I just saw everyone reading it. I found it horrible; I had to make myself finish it.Basically, the leaps of logic made in the book are far out and unrealistic. I found the book to also be very anti-Catholic, and, being a Catholic, I found much of the text to be offensive and inaccurate. Anyone with a basic knowledge of Christian and Catholic history can punch holes through the plot so large that it becomes worthless to continue reading.This is not an accurate book or a historical expose as many believe it to be; it is at best a poor fictional story. My only regret is that many people pick up the book and read it, believing, as the author represents it to be, as a storyline imposed on a factual basis."
2,Stop after first 100 pages,"Dan Brown got me hooked during the first 100 pages of the book, but brother (no pun intended) were the last few hundred pages a chore to finish reading. I have no Catholic axe to grind either, although the book was highly insulting to the Vatican-based organization. The reason I disliked the biggest portion of the book was that is was B-O-R-I-N-G. What a major disappointment after all the great reviews I'd read about it. Brown didn't deliver after a very good opening. It read like a bad movie script. Very shallow characters. No action. Predictable plot points. I would encourage you to go elsewhere for a great summer read!"
1,fast read,"I wasn't going to write a review until I saw that someone called this book a ""masterpiece"". Masterpiece of what? The ""facts"" (?) really are fascinating but the fiction is sub-Grisham at best. Conspiracy is fun but what about the art of writing? There were a couple of incidents so ridiculous that you may find yourself wincing.It is a fast read, though. There are a few 2 page chapters and they go by really fast!If you want to read an excellent book that includes thoughts on gnosticism and the questionable roots of Christianity then I recommend ""The Dream of Scipio""."
1,Da Vinci Code,"I gave it a star as there isn't a 'no star' option.Forget the supposedly ""controversial"" content and concentrate on the quality of writing and story structure. Mr Brown writes for an immature teenage audience. The cast are poor caricatures in a badly directed play without a real plot. The scenes are pure fantasy and I just get the feeling that Dan Brown is writing to order. He may well have talent (he can fill the pages) but I won't believe it is beyond the mundane, publisher prompted airport level, until he can write something with the detail and depth of Frederick Forsyth, say. Forsyth is no master either but I think his writing comes from experience and the heart rather than overdone research and editorial interference.I read the first couple of chapters and couldn't wait to put it down. The plot was weak, the writing poor and the detail pompous and overblown."
3,An easy read,"Settle down in your favorite stuffed chair, prop your feet up and suspend your sense of reality in order to enjoy this work of fiction.Yes, I agree - the characters need work, the plot is convoluted and over-the-top, and the ideas are far from new. But this is a light form of entertainment. It is definately not a history lesson nor a Biblical study. And if the story bores you, well. . . .the illustrations/photos are beautiful!Granted, this is far from a masterpiece. But sometimes at the end of the day, I am looking for a form of entertainment that does not require too much brain power! So, enjoy the chase.And, oh yes! The ending was a bit of a let down for me. I was looking for something more dramatic/creative. Thus, the reason for three stars.A light, quick read. . ."
4,Fasten your seatbelt!,A fast-paced thriller you will be unable to put down!! A brilliant combination of actual history and true biography of the Master painter himself combined with a mystery with a surprise at the end-nice fast reading for a day (as that is all you will need) at the beach! Not a true work of heavy duty literature and at times reads like a Sydney Sheldon novel; nonetheless keeps you at the end of your seat till the last page. A great summer thriller!
4,"So, is it really Mary in DaVinci's Pieta?","There are books you read because you feel some sort of compunction to be educated, there are books you read because others feel you should be educated, and there are books you read just for fun that end up being educational; this book falls into that last category. This book is enlightening on two main points, the role of the ""Illuminati"" in art history, and the deep distaste Mr. Brown has for the Catholic Church. Despite the bone he has to pick with ""Rome"" the book is very interesting, and even though it is a popular murder mystery, it does not descend into rank sentimentality. Overall, an excellent read."
2,The book is a 4-star if you stop reading before the end,"Dan Brown just does not know when to stop - he is too clever by half. A surprise ending is great; two more surprises that undo the previous surprise(s) gets annoying. Mr. Brown has a genius for making what could be a fairly dry/academic topic very exciting and (to a point) plausible. He brings the reader along for a great ride - up to a point - and then, as he has done in all of his books, he goes beyond the point of credulity and crashes. It is a shame. I have read three of his books. He is a fine writer but (or at least could be), but until he has learned to stop trying to prove how clever he is and put his pencil down he will continue to be like the painter who paints a masterpiece, but lacking the wisdom of knowing when to stop, keeps painting and makes a second-rate mess."
1,The Da Vinci Code,"I found this book to be deceptive, pandering to our incessant search for moral loopholes. The author has taken old myths and repackaged them for a reading public that has very little experience with history. The melding of fact and fiction was clever and misleading, leaving us breathless with anticipation for the next tricky twist. If you read this, please do yourself the service of investigating the fact/fiction that serves as the base for this novel."
2,"WELL WRITTEN, BUT.....","This is the second book in which Brown decides to make the Catholic Church look like a bunch of deceitful, fanatical, and desperate bunch of wackos. Brown knows how to write a book, but I frankly am tired of all this speculation. In this one, we find out what Brown thinks the Holy Grail is, and other assorted ""facts"" drawn through the ages. Give it a rest, Dan. You're a good writer, as shown in ""Deception Point,"" but leave the church alone.NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,CSI meets Dungeons and Dragons,"I usually like my murder mysteries under 300 pages, so when Dan Brown stuffed 200 pages of repetitive mumbo-jumbo about the Crusades and Opus Dei and double-secret Roman Catholic societies into his muted thriller, he lost me. I had to finish the book for my discussion group, but the effort didn't pay off. I tip my hat to him for finding a formula that sells 60 million books plus, but I don't think the Da Vinci Code will be an enduring read. There's nothing wrong with having a gimmick and he's wrapped a decent read around this one. Don't confuse it it with a) literature b) history or c) religious revelation."
4,"Solid, Entertaining Book....that Will Mke You Think","I'm a devout Christian of the Baptist faith, and blessedly have studied the bible for over twelve years; therefore, I can clearly absorb this book without any antsy feelings or anger. It's fiction, a good read for a weekend of nights-at-home.I tip my hat to Dan Brown for creating a well told story from historical and theological ideas existing in the real world: the Priory of Scion, Da Vinci's curiously ingenious creations, the many churches along with their storied histories, the violent past of Christianity, and Opus Dei to name a few.Please relax and enjoy it. Ignore the controversy. It reads quite well.By the way, please realize that the follow-up streamlined movie cuts out a lot from the book but still plays well on the screen if no overzealous nitpicking materializes."
2,Interesting ideas overshadowed by bad writing,"I like a of the ideas put forth in Dan Brown's books.They're INTERESTING. Something to tickle the imagination, get the brain working a bit, in directions perhaps it does not normally go.But he's really not a very good writer of fiction.I read this, all the while thinking that the interesting ideas, in the hands of a competent writer of thrillers, would have really given me a greater pay-off.His action is not very compelling, there are far too many cliff hangers, and his characters are largely uninteresting or simply not believable.As a thriller, Da Vinci Code is not very...thrilling.I certainly had no problem putting the book down each night, which is just not the case when I'm immersed in a well-written thriller.I could post the same review for his other books, they're all of same quality, writing-wise, but find this behavior cheesy in others."
3,"Remember, it's FICTION!","Anyone who ""believes"" the theories in this book needs to remember that it is FICTION--just because the author has his ""respected characters"" reveal ""hidden truths"" DOESN'T mean what the characters are saying is true. Most of the time, it's not, it's all just silly fun, so enjoy it for what it is, but really, it IS fiction, so don't believe everything you read!"
3,Too Much For Me,"Many unexpected twists, turns, and curves made The DaVinci Code interesting at first, but as these surprises continued relentlessly, I grew tired. With mysteries, I as the reader, at least like a chance to try to figure out ""who dunnit"" -- but even the most astute could not have in this plot, I believe. I also had trouble with discerning fact and fiction, and that bothered me - especially considering the substance of the plot. Disclaimers on a lead-in page of the book lead one to believe that information regarding secret societies and their practices are factual. But the obvious question then becomes, ""If they are secret, how do we or the author know about them?"" The end was a little too soppy for me, also. Starting out, it was a real page-turner, and all in all, it was not a bad read, although putting it down became easier from the middle on. Generally speaking, it was all just a little too much for my taste."
1,Save Your Money,"This is NOT an ""intelligent and lucid thriller."" The materail about the Grail Myth is okay, the symbolic interpretaitions of famous works of art and lit are okay, but after that, the book is just plain dull. The characters are flat, cardboard figures. The plot is a maze of coincidences and last second, farfetched solutions to unbelievable problems, as though the author is just making things up as he goes along. The writing plods forward. I believed the hype. You'd think I was old enough to know better."
3,What's the hoopla about?,"I must admit I enjoyed reading the book, one of those guilty pleasures. Sure it is mostly nonsense, a dumbed down version of Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco, but it makes for a nice beach read. Why it has become such is runaway bestseller is a mystery. Perhaps a clue can be found in some lost Da Vinci masterpiece."
2,Scooby Doo Ending,"Secret societies, albino monks, murder, mystery... what more could I have asked for? I should have asked for more! The background or pseudo-history of secret societies and hidden religions was very facinating. The writing style was horrible, though. As each chapter passed, I found the formula of *answer a question* then *find a clue* then *ask another question* then *turn to the next chapter* tiring. I doubt this entire escapade took only a day and a half! And the Scooby Doo ending to boot!"
3,"Entertaining plot, but that's about it.","If you're looking for a fast, easy, entertaining read, this book's for you. If you are looking for substance, characterization and plain ole good writing, it's not.I don't know what Dan Brown was trying to accomplish but I felt as if I was reading an Encyclopedia Brown book.Honestly, that's how the chapters ended, each with a fantastical cliffhanger that hampered the book's credibility.Good plot, is all I can say."
2,DaVinci or Monty Python?,"I enjoyed the provocative information about the Magdalene but it was spoiled by a mediocre ""who dunnit."" The killer (big psycho guy, lacking melanin) was something I'd have attributed to Monty Python. I recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library."
2,"Good Research, Poor Writer","On occasion this story was good, but after the author used the same technique to cheat the audience repeatedly just to keep some suspense going, I started to get bored.It is also interesting to note that every extra (disposable) character in the same scene has the exact same reaction as all the others. I didn't realize there were still so many sheep bleating overseas.If you want a good story and don't mind the author's poor writing skills, this is a decent attempt. I must admit I was amazed when I realized Dan Brown had been published before - I thought the mistakes he made were because he was a beginner!"
2,It could have been a contender,"If only it didn't go to seed at the end. And if only the prose were better. And if only the sooper-dooper smart characters were actually sooper-dooper smart (at times they acted as if they were characters in a Teen Movie). Yes, thank goodness for Eco."
1,Is Dan Brown a pen name for Danielle Steele?,"I bought the book for a good vacation read, but have read more eloquent prose in trashy romance novels. Do this to see if this book is more than a travel pamphlet for Europe. Go to Chapter 3, read the first paragraph out loud. I was so disappointed. The plot is also very transparent. I was not moved to read any of his other books if this is the sort of mush he serves his readers. Did anyone else realize AT ONCE that the 'language' was actually English written backward? How dumb is Rob, anyway? Save your money."
1,Paper-thin characters prop up a slow-moving plot...,"...which is really only intended to showcase a set of outrageous historical howlers.This book is a transparent attempt to undermine the faith of Christians -- and to pad the author's bank account.What begins as a fairly nifty thriller -- the first 75 pages or so are diverting, I do admit -- quickly gets bogged down in wildly inaccurate claims about the Catholic Church which any casual student of European history will be able to see through.The characters are totally static, standing there like featureless beaches upon which bogus historical ""explanations"" hammer interminably, wave upon wave upon wave.I only finished this bilious pile because relatives asked me to. I think they secretly feared that the ""fascinating esoterica of history""-- as, I believe, the above review put it -- was true.But not to fear. This book is neither ""fascinating"" nor historical. It is pure fiddle-faddle, and don't waste your time or your money."
3,Audio abridged version very borderline,Those readers/listeners interested in an audio version of the da Vinci code should avoid product. There are at least six female characters voiced in this version -- and I am quite sure these are male readers dubbing a poor feminine (French accent) voice. The voices are so egregiously appalling as to distract from the content. The producers didn't respect the buyer enought to hire real women! Avoid this abridged CD version or you will have a five hour road trip from hell...
5,Engrossing...couldn't put it down,"A terrific and suspensful ""novel"" which takes the reader through the twists and turns of a 2,000 year old mystery playing out in todays high tech environment. This is a great ""story""...foget the hype about what it says or doesn't say about Christianity and the hypersensitive who can't handle any criticism fictional or otherwise. Dan Brown has not said anything in this book that others have not said for centuries, he just does in a great, readable, and enjoyable format. It's a great book and a great read."
1,"Really, really lame","Cardboard characters...an art ""scholar"" who spouts goddess pseudohistory concocted by 19-century bunk artist and then popularized by neopagan Starhawk who wasn't really interested in actual historical truth...one chase/escape after another to the point of tedium. The scholarship and the characters who are supposedly scholars lack all credibility; this wouldn't matter if as fiction it still made a good story, but it is so lame. It's like a mishmash of a lot of thriller movies, but lacking any character of its own. I am totally puzzled why so many people recommend this book. They must not read much. Go find something else; it's not hard to find better reading than this."
1,Much Better Books on this Subject Out There,"This is a poorly written piece of pulp. There are much better books on this subject out there. Holy Blood, Holy Grail for one. Whether any of the ideas presented in these works are true is a subject for another debate. But if your goal is to read a work that is easily dismissed, then look no further than Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code for that is its sole charm. On the other hand, if you are a serious inquirer, you may find the following works interesting:The Fifth Gospel: New Evidence from the Tibetan, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian and Urdu Sources About the Historical Life of Jesus Christ After the Crucifixion by Fida Hassnain and Dahan LeviJesus in Kashmir, The Lost Tomb by Suzanne OlssonRoza Bal The Tomb of Jesus by Fida M. Hassnain & Suzanne OlssonThe Unknown Life of Jesus Christ by Nicolas NotovitchBloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed by Laurence Gardner"
2,Way Over-Hyped,"I'm ashamed to say that I bought this book because of the international furor. What are people thinking? The writing is no better than average and the aspersions about the Templar's, Mary Magdalene, the Holy Grail etc. etc. ad nauseum, are ridiculous.Yes, Mary is an important figure in early Christianity. At one level, she WAS a disciple and may have been an apostle. It is even conceivable that she and Jesus were married. It is also conceivable that she was married to one of Jesus' other apostles. There is no way to know. Beyond that there is only wild, pointless speculation.This book is aimed at gullible fish and, judging from the hype, Brown hooked them all too eaily. It is unfortunate that there are so many people who so badly want to believe nonsense. I wonder who they'll be voting for this election cycle?Ron Braithwaite, author of Mexican Conquest novels, ""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God"""
4,A great action packed read,"This book is off to the races from the beginning to end, leaving the reader wanting more after each page as there's mystery, murder, good and bad, as well as lots of historical knowledge. However there are also various perspectives of the authors interpretation of organized religious and anti religious groups which makes the book even more readable but no believable. However, if you really want to read a hollywood movie style book, read his first book Angels and Demons which is even more off the wall."
5,Amazing !,"This was the first book I read of this author and I've finished it in 1 week. I just loved it. The details are amazing and surprisingly not boring at all. I'm reading ""Deception Point"" now and I'm loving it so far. I'm really impressed."
2,Why is this book so popular!?,"I refused to believe all the hype about this book for a couple of years until just recently I finally picked it up. Wow. I was disappointed. The story itself is provoking and brings up some interesting points, but overall it is a cheaply written thriller.There are much better, more interesting thrillers by Michael Crichton and the likes. Overall I would compare this book to a cheap action flick, one that causes you to laugh at the shear audacity of many of the scenes, laughing, pointing and saying ""Hey! That could never happen!""In conclusion, if you like books you probably won't like this one. If you prefer reality TV then you will love this book. Blah."
3,Klunky,"I'm only about 50 chapters into the novel. but that's enough to say that the style is very klunky, and dotted with questionable assertons. Brown is not a smooth stylist.Minor point: Bishops here are always addressed as ""Bishop,"" rather than ""Your Excellency."" Brown refers to ""the Bishop of Philadelphia."" For quite a few years, Philly has had a Cardinal Archbishop.On the positive side, the story is fair, and maintains some suspense. But the underlying thesis cannot be taken seriously.The evidence is too thin.Brown sacrifices some credibility when he has his Brit expert say that Constantine codified the canon of the Bible. Nope. In general, Brown makes some ludicrous simplistic statements for dramatic effect.I would recommend the book as a imaginative, sensationistic thriller, but with qualifications."
1,Da Truth,"If you are looking to kill a few hours and have your B.S. detector set relatively low, you may enjoy this book. Mr. Brown has made an attempt to popularize some very stale and discounted conspiracy drivel in a creaky, formulaic throw-away mystery.I can see other authors trying to capitalize on The Code's success by resurrecting Lincoln, JFK and even Bermuda triangle conspiracy ideas that have received some past interest in print.I am not a Catholic, but I think that Mr. Brown owes the church an apology. The irony here is that Brown uses deception to make some kind of case about what he believes are the lies of the church. His agenda is obvious in the tedious preaching of the unbelievably one dimensional characters.The least he could do is donate some of the profits to a Catholic charity, maybe the Mother Teresa foundation."
1,Anti-Catholic Bigotry,This book is just another turgid attempt to foist anti-Catholic bigotry on the unsuspecting. It makes blatent errors about Catholicism that could have been solved just by looking in the catechism. I don't know any members of Opus Dei who are assassins. It smacks of how the Jesuits were portrayed in the 19th century. Amazing how anti-Catholic ignorance transcends time. No other religion gets treated this way or there would be cries of foul. Even non-Catholics will be offended by this book. Don't give the bigots your money. Buy something worthwile to read instead.
2,What a letdown!!!,"After all the hype, what a waste!I thought the story was very lacking. No character development and not original. The whole premise of the book is contained in three pages in the middle of the book that are portrayed as historical fact but given no support.This is the type of book that is what libraries are intended for. A book not worth paying good money for."
2,Sacreligious Wild Goose Chase,"The Davinci Code unfolds as a Grail Quest, but it's really just a wild goose chase. The book has to be one of the most sacreligious books in recent memory; doing for Christianity what Muslims felt the Satanic Versus did for Islam."
3,Good and Bad,"Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" reveals the controversial and fascinating history of early Christianity in a fast paced murder mystery. His research shows how Mother Earth became a man's world when the goddess was banished from the temple. The obliteration of the sacred feminine resulted in a ""life out of balance"" and disrespect for Mother Earth. Based on the Coptic and Dead Sea Scrolls the Bible is a product of men with a political agenda. The Holy Grail is an ancient symbol for the sacred feminine and represents a woman. And that Jesus was a mortal prophet who married Mary Magdalene and had children.Although the suspense is a page-turner Brown's remarkable research would have been better served by a slower paced novel with more developed characters. It was the riveting story not the historical research or the two-dimensional good versus evil characters that stayed with me after reading the book."
5,Wonderful!,"I absolutely loved this book; great concept with and extremely interesting viewpoint on the early church. I find it rather amusing how most of the poor reviews this book has received come from what appear to be Christian fanatics. The book, however, is not without its flaws. The characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts. While I would have appreciated realistic, breathing, characters to read about, it in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the book."
4,"Good read, well researched - weak ending","It keeps your interest 3/4 of the way through the book. Unfortunately, it appears all the author's research and clever storytelling falls victim to a rather loose-ended, 'I wrote the ending in one afternoon' finale. It would have been hard to write a believable ending anyway. Still a good read. Two obvious blunders in a highly detailed and researched book (they aren't pivotal to the plot). Adam was offered a 'fruit' in the bible not an 'apple' and Sir Isaac Newton was a virgin his whole life."
4,Intriguing,"I'll not get into the details of the plot to avoid spoilers.Regardless on where you stand on these issues religiously, this is a masterfully written novel. Sure, it may not be historically accurate... but who cares? This is not supposed to be history. It's fiction, and it's really good at it. The plot grips you at the beginning and never lets you go. The characters are not that well developed but the storyline is so good that it doesn't matter so much. Great work!"
2,Over-rated,This book was barely passable. Angels and demons was much better (had a weak ending though). I was greatly disappointed.
2,Entertainingly Moronic,"I'm almost ashamed to admit I read this book, as it was such a moronic piece of fiction. My excuse for starting it is that it was a hot topic at the time I read it (2004); my excuse for finishing it (and this is the shameful part, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars) is that it was a decent thriller, in a mindless sort of way--the literary equivalent of Die Hard 2, 3, 4, ... But the book was filled with such ridiculous and inexcusable errors of fact that it took the edge off whatever pulp pleasure I might have otherwise derived from it--and convinced me never to read another Dan Brown book, however desperate for escapist fiction I might become."
2,Disappointing,"This book does not live up to the hype. Its a quick and easy read because the chapters are very short and virtually every one ends in a cliffhanger. In between cliffhangers the characters stand around explaining things to each other with long verbal dissertations about feminine symbolism. The ideas presented are old conspiracy-theory stuff, which is ok in itself, but I think the author reaches too far into the unbelievable (Disney? The Vatican is broke?) The Big Secret is not a new idea, either. The ending of this book is particularly silly. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it inspired me to learn something about the Council of Nicea on my own - certainly a very important event in history, but not accurately portrayed in this novel."
2,Finished book. Moan. A Lisa,"Two stars for telling me some stuff I didn't know. 0 stars for talent or style. I didn't know people wrote like this any more, nor did I know anyone wanted to.Paul Nassau"
2,I read it but am afraid to tell my friends,This is a compelling mystery remixing the grail mythos. However Mr. Brown's characters and their emotional interactions are preadolescent.
4,"Just Like His ""Angels and Demons"" Which is Both Good and Bad","This book is, as noted before, as a ""Can't put it down!"". However, I felt I was just going through the motions.Don't get me wrong, it was a good read. It just seemed like d√©j√† vu all over again. Langdon is woken up in the middle of a night with a phone call and is instantly running around Rome and now London again solving ancient puzzles and fighting secret societies.Again, using historical and present-day reality brings a sense of urgency to the book. But what happens when Brown runs out of secret societies to write about?"
1,Disgraceful,"I am a fan of DALE BROWN (Dan's brother) so I thought I would give the Da Vinci Code a try. The book is intriguing at first, but poorly written and filled with half-truths and out-right lies. Mostly based on Anti-Catholic myth and pagan symbology, there is ZERO evidence to support the claims made in the bookIf you are an ANTI-CATHOLIC, you will love the book. The simple facts are that the Holy Roman Catholic Church is THE FINAL word on Christ. The Church has the historians and scholars that can read the original scriptures written in Ancient Greek, no other church does! That is a FACT JACK!Dan Brown is no Dale Brown. Dale should knock the heck out of his little brother, who obviously envies Dale's success."
3,"Promising start, stumbling finish","At first I couldn't put this book down-the plot twists and clues were holding my interest pretty well. Then the situations got more preposterous, the chance encounters more convenient and the plot twists got predicable, which should be a cardinal sin for a book championing cryptology."
3,Interesting,"I don't have much time to read but managed to make it through this book. I like my books simple and this book is as simple as you are going to get. It dragged in a few spots, but all of the symbolism and the secret society references were intriguing."
1,I prefer not to,I found it unenlightened and banal. It was so hackneyed and trite and vapid and tasteless that anyone who reads it loses a multitude of braincells. Why would you subject yourself to such a travesty of the English Language???? Brown should take a lesson from Emerson's self-reliance and get his own ideas...
1,DAN BROWN: RACIST? or NOT A RACIST?,I've been hearing that Dan Brown is a white supremacist and said some bad things about black women. Anyone here know if this is true? I see one of his readers (Minerva) harbors a negative attitude about black women but I haven't yet come across anything explicit from Dan Brown himself.
5,Excellent,"Enjoyed listening to this book on cd, great for people who commute in a car, found the book very suspenseful, had a hard time leaving the car when I arrived to my destination."
1,Da Vinci Con,Interesting background viz. the sacred feminine. Horrible mystery writing. Spend your time and money reading Neal Stephenson.
2,Intriguing plot ... disappointing novel,"Very disappointing political/religious thriller based on a controversial and intriguing hypothesis. A predictable plot line with just a few surprising turns had me to the point of dropping the book altogether several times. Very weak support for some of the, potentially, juicier claims and total ignorance of the inner workings of the Roman Catholic Church.For anyone interested in the subject I would much rather recommend ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" which - despite its sensationalistic treatment of the matter - does indeed raise some interesting questions."
2,Never read a best seller or an Oprah book,"Flat, characterless, inaccurate and entirely guessable including the Isaac Newton clue, and the Da Vinci Code itself. Jeez--I'm pretty dumb and I had it figured out. Even as to the villain's true identity. Who else could it be. There was no one left!Plus as one other reviewer noted, the whole novel somehow takes place in one action-packed 56 hour day!In summary, the Church bites; Templars, Masons and Rosicrucians were weird and mysterious, everybody wants the Grail, no one expects the Spanish Inquisition, women are cool and even if you don't know how to have a relationship with one, it's nice to have a babe to go on an adventure with, even if you only get to kiss her on the last page."
3,Overrated Beach Reading,"This is good hack work, but for insights into early Christianity I much prefer THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS CHRIST by Neil Elliott. This book begins with standard characters, then devolves into a so-called mystery the answer to which presumably will rock the foundations of the Catholic church. But it's just laughable that the New York Times gave this high praise, and shows how far their reviewers have fallen, and how little they understand Catholicism. Most Americans are not Catholic, and even those who are are not preoccupied with it. Da Big Mystery Exposed would draw a ho-hum from most of them.This is beach reading that will impress New York intellectuals as deep and weighty, since they understand Christianity, the Vatican, and Catholicism not at all. But when the spook jumps out of the closet and yells ""boo"", most Catholic readers will just shrug and say ""So what?"""
1,ridiculous and dangerous,"If the kind of utter falsehoods put forth as ""fact"" in this piece of nonsense were included in a novel where the religion in question was Judaism, most thinking people would be condemning it as anti-semitic and they would do so justifiably. Yet for some reason it is politically correct to accuse the Catholic church of just about anything.I am not a Catholic, I am a Mormon, and I am very disheartened by the favor this junk seems to be enjoying with the public. It is accepted that authors can use creative liscense in works of fiction, but Mr. Brown should be ashamed of himself for his assertion that the information he bases this silly premise on is factual.Yes, I have read it. It was a choice for my book club and I am very sorry that it was."
1,A simple book for simple people,"A simple book for simple people. It reads more like the plot to a B movie than the runaway hit of the decade. I was very sad at how bad it was since I love the history/mystery genre.I've read both Angels and Demons and Deception Point and enjoyed them a little but little did I expect that the Da Vinci code would be so unbearable. The writing is simplistic the characters as thin as paper and the plot forced and I believe absurd came to mind once or twice.Facts or not this should be a kid's book. I kind of chuckle when I read reviews like ""Will change your outlook on life"" whoa, get a grip people, reality is calling.Should you read it? Probably just to see what all the hype is about.Should you get the illustrated version? No not worth it. The images are few and the important ones just view on the internet."
2,Average,"Dan Brown had some interesting historical insight on the brotherhoods and of Da Vinci's life. However, the story is very predictable, especially after all the attention it has received. If you like this type of story, you should read Katherine Neville's books ""The Eight"" & ""Magic Circle"". She does a much better job in concocting a story line that keeps you on your toes."
1,Comical History/Fairly Interesting Fiction,"As a fan of Brown, I was sad to see his cult-like comments about this book in which he proclaims himself the new expert on 2,000 years of history. His grasp of this history is closer to a senior high school student, and was more than a little unusual. I know any author needs to fall in love with the topic, but this one was over the top. Nice fiction effort. I look forward to his future books. I hope he can just drop this X-file level story-line and move on. He is so creative with fiction, that I would appeal that he not quit this area of giftedness for amateur history class."
5,Amazing!,"While Dan Brown has been criticized for many aspects of his writing style, this book was totally captivating, I really could not put it down. Well researched, excellent pacing, a great mystery. I loved it."
2,Engaging but not Dan Brown's best work,"Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" is engaging for about eighty percent of the book after which it becomes a slow somewhat laborious read. The story line is very predictable and written with an obvious Hollywood slant. Hence the movie...Dan Brown is a very good writer but this book is not one of his best. Check out ""Angles and Demons"" or ""Decpetion Point"" for more engaging and less predictable storylines. The former, A&D;, being a difficult book to put down right through the final pages!"
5,Everyone should read it,"This book was extraordinary. There. All my thoughts in four words. I recommend that it is, along with the current book ""West Point"" by Norman Thomas Remick, one of the most extraordinary books ever written. Everyone should read it."
2,Not an original work,"Brown's *The Da Vinci Code* mixes the holy-grail story with shallow, web-based research on symbolism, iconology, paganism, early Christianity, and historical tidbits of certain historically significant places in London and Paris. His structure is choppy, and he seems to lift his prose from other sources. Consider the following excerpt from his book (p. 395):""Westminster Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church. It bears the classification of royal peculiar, subject only to the sovereign.""[...]""Neither a cathedral nor a parish church, Westminster Abbey is a 'royal peculiar' under the jurisdiction of a Dean and Chapter, subject only to the Sovereign.""One can only guess how many other such examples pervade the book. Very disappointing."
3,"Sorry, but An Albino wouldn't make a discreet...","... choice for a professional hitman, and in this book all I kept thinking of was that Chevy Chase movie which had an albino hitman pursuing the hapless Goldie Hawn. The Da Vinci Code has some merits, but its shameless inspiration from video store rental shelves and some inexcusably cardboard ""placeholder"" characters makes this a lightweight book.It can be gripping, and Dan Brown has a good instinct for suspense. But his hero Robert Langdon is BORING, with no depth or believable traits. He just sits on the page as a collection of verbs.I enjoyed the Knights Templar history, which though a bit simplistically portrayed is still fun. But Brown hasn't figured out how to reveal historical details while keeping the pacing strong.Not This Century's Great Novel. Not the Worst Book either. A mild read, the bookstore equivalent of a popular music video."
1,Truly baffling,"I'm referring, of course, not to the plot but to this book's huge success. It has made very little impact here in the UK but is now being marketed very aggressively so no doubt will be a best-seller here, too. I found it poorly written and pretty boring, full of implausabilities. The story keeps stopping while the author shoehorns in huge chunks of information and clunky descriptions of Paris. So why are you all buying this book?"
1,Utter rubbish.,"Avoid this cliche-ridden piece of rancid jetsam like the plague. It is thoughtless, plotless, depthless, pointless, and shameless.'Best-seller' status in AD 2006 should be warning enough, however.I'm now off to write a novel about Amazon's complicity in the propogation of pagan rites as revealed by their pentacle rating system."
2,How did Dan Brown get payed to write anything?,"Listen, I understand that the story is a bit exciting and fun to read at times, but this guy is a really weak writer. I don't want to be an elitist, but i have read some pretty good stuff in my day and this is really not it at all. The story itself is totally unbelieveable, but that's okay. Who said books can't be a bit fantastic and out-there? but Brown is a really terrible writer. The DV Code is totally forced, concocted, and cheesey. And have you tried any of the other books this clown had written? Digital Fortress was again, a nice little (predictable) story, but Holy S### was the writing weak. So in the end if you want to be entertained, I bet the movie will be worth 10 bucks, but the read? Do that at your own risk of reading some of the most shoddy writing you've ever read, unless of course you read Steele, or Higgins-Clark, or Clancy for that matter."
4,Intriguing Tale,"Despite the occasional sophomoric exchanges between the main characters, this story -- regardless of what you believe or what faiths you hold -- is a very well organized tale. The entire thrust occupies the late hours of one day to the morning of the next. This timeframes enforces the highest organizational skills for the characters to play their play. It also enforces a few real-life notions that one is better to ignore as he reads. The players for the most part seem genuine and are well depicted. The crux of the book is well presented, regardless of your spiritual faith. One feels very much a part of the action. Seemingly real characters are acting out seemingly real exchanges.The first major surprise in this book I did not find satisfying. The last few pages revealed another I found far more meaningful and satisfying.A fun book for most to read, and something to ponder."
2,Over-rated,"This book is a very average mystery decorated with some religious history, commentary and theory. As a religious studies student, I found that the religious references confused and far-fetched. I did however find some of the book interesting, but the characters and plot were predictable and forgettable.At times this book is fun, but it's primarily bland and silly."
2,Comic Book for Adults,"This author loves number riddles and in this book he adroitly discovers the lowest common denominator. But what's more important, how many books Dan Brown sells or the legacy of great individuals? (He should be imprisoned for what he did to Bernini in Angels and Demons - but, heh, heh, not too many lawyers around representing 17th century sculptors) This is Spiderman in the Louvre, Batman gallavanting around Europe. The plot is intricate and the background semi-interesting, but the characters are flat and the dialogue laughable. And the author REALLY needs to fess up in his little ""Fact"" sections as to what's not real regarding important historical figures. Can anyone name an Oliver Stone movie since JFK? Coming soon to a theater near you, America!"
3,"Interesting themes, predictable story","The great thing about this book is how it brings to light how women have been neglected in th history of the Catholic Church. It is worth reading just for the education you get in that. The plot is the thriller-in-a-day variety that the author has used time and again. It works, but it's hurried and formulaic. I'm afraid when they make the movie (and they are sure to) they'll leave in all the action and take out the meat - Who is Mary, who is Mary Magdelene, what is their significance? Sigh."
1,Hugely disappointing,"I'd heard about this book from many reputable sources and was looking forward to diving into what I hoped would be an intelligent thriller. What I discovered was a trite and predictable novel offering little suspense or insight into its subject -- even the pacing was forced. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this wasn't even a decent read. I just don't understand the hype."
4,Mind blowing! Bu-u-ut . . .,"THE DA VINCI CODE will eat up my next paycheck. The story-within-a-story is so fascinating, I've already added 4 related books to my Wish List. A great big *thank you* to Dan Brown for writing about one of the most ancient, intriguing, enigmatic mysteries!As a thriller, however, it doesn't work well. Some of the plot twists struck me as unnecessary -- there for their own sake, not smoothly weaving themselves into the story. The premise for the murders never quite made sense to me. Maybe I missed something? And listen, if I can figure out the encoded clues long before the Harvard symbologist and the professional cryptologist do, they're way too easy.With that out of the way, I loved this book!! It's easily one of the most fascinating I've read. Despite its faults, I highly recommend it.*After* you've read THE DA VINCI CODE, do yourself a favor and visit Dan Brown's website. 'Nuff said!"
3,"Interesting, but....","The book was entertaining, but too much background information. There are many excellent, faster-paced historical mysteries such as The Patriote Proposition, listed in zshops."
3,Just like movie blockbusters!!,"I think overall the book contains a lot of educational information but the attempt for suspense failed. I was able to read it and put it down for a number of days. The suspense parts were ok but they are so mainstream and not original, it is all something that we have either seen in movies or read in other books. And of course, the mass appeal it is not very attractive."
3,captivating,I like the story telling and narration. It keeps one interested through out. It would make a good movie!
5,Dan Brown is a master storyteller,What a wonderful read. I enjoyed this book tremendously and have recommended it to several friends. This is one of those books that I will be reading again.
3,"Sure, it's a page turner....","and I read the whole book from start to finish. However, as I reading it, I was thinking things like ""it's a good thing I've read <i>Holy Blood Holy Grail</i> and all those other nonfiction books about Jesus's so-called bloodline, or I wouldn't know what this book was talking about"" to ""what stilted dialogue!"" to ""these people narrowly escaped death how many times in how many locations within the span of a few hourse, and didn't keel over??"" to ""yep, I guessed that one"" to ""oh yeah, I knew they'd end up there."" My biggest gripe though was ""how many TIMES is this dude gonna WHITEWASH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?!"" When there is so much interesting non-fiction out there on this subject, I think I'll stick to that in the future."
3,"A ""glass is half full"" 3 stars...","Strong start to this book, but it definately tails off towards the end. Brown's secret society speculation is fascinating and the book is a page turner almost all the way through. But aside from some of the interesting tidbits the author throws in, the story itself is weak at best and annoyingly bad at worst. That said, I was fascinated by Browns discussion of religion. I guess I would have given this book one more star if not for the excess of praise heaped upon it by other reviewers and it's seemingly endless spot atop the best seller list. Thus, I deny it 1 star in protest..."
4,great story and awesome facts but a little hard to follow,"When I started reading this book, it was a little confusing, but I guess it's one of those books where you have to read more to find out, because at the end it all fit and it was great!Anyway, to whoever asked, the pictures and illustrations add so much to the story! I don't know if I ever could have figured it out without them. It's also very interesting how Dan Brown fit all the real facts together to create a fiction story!Wow. A great story. I really recommend it!"
3,just an allright novel,"I wanted more bear action in this novel. It seems the ""extinct"" bears got less play than the romance? between exes Jack and Cassandra. I know I wouldn't want to be in some deep, dark cave with my ex! All in all this book reminds one of a few recent books like ""Extinct"" and ""The Trench"" where thought to be extinct creatures come in contact with man with expected results. I'm not saying this is a bad novel, just that there are better examples of this genre out there."
4,Gets the job done,"If you're using it for the occasional magnifying needs, I'd say it's hard to beat for the price! Although if you're going to be using it a lot (finding 60/120 cleavage anyone??), I might suggest looking for a slightly higher quality one. The image from this isn't quite as clear as some of my classmates' lenses and it sort of gives me a headache after a while. Also it was a golden brassy color, not chrome, but color was hardly important to me. It's cheap and it magnifies!"
3,Hand Lens,"product was okay. I don't think that they correct item was sent because the one i received had a gold finish and not a chrome finish like the item described. Still, it works fine for what i need and it was cheap."
2,"OK, but not power enough motor",The nail touch tool is OK but doesn't have enough power to really do the job. I would purchase a more powerful tool instead.
1,The Bear Market is over!,"It's over, on 9/27/02 on the O'Reilly Factor, Daniel Solin has shown that with his pessimistic view that we have reached a bottom. Unreal. He is the flip side of the Bull Market talking heads."
4,Indians of Wisconsin,"I have other books about the Menominii, but Hodge's book goes into detail about Chief Oshkosh and others. Many drawings and Photographs."
5,If you are having trouble with Trig....,"As with all of Bittinger's books that I have used, this one makes the subject easy to understand. If you're having trouble grasping the concepts of Trig, this book will really help you.Also, there are lots of hints and directions for using your calculator to solve trig problems.I only have an hour a week to work with students, so having a book that has lots of explanation is an essential key to success."
1,terrible,Video quality is of the poorest. Videos not tracked so you have to fast forward to get to the videos you want.
2,dirty south #1 (music dvd),"i received this dvd months ago, & i rated it at that time, so please see EARLIER REVIEW as to my thoughts & feelings regarding a 2 rating."
4,Very Appealing to Children,"This book is very well written and will entice reluctant readers. Children will love the references to underwear and ""sleeping bare""."
2,Awful acting!!,"I found this film to be of a poor quality. The acting, particually that of Jesus was embarrasing and the plotline could have been more biblical and intriguing. I was very disapointed. Jesus was portrayed a bit too effeminately for my liking."
4,"Brahms's sunniest work, done in relaxed fashion","For whatever reason, Karajan avoided recording either of Brahms's wonderful Serenades, and DG made up the slack with Abbado. Here he conducts the Berlin Phil. from 1983 in a very accomplished reading, marred somewhat by edgy early-digital sonics. There's an unpleasant sting to the violins at higher volume.Abbado has never considered Brahms a composer of conflict or inner struggle, thus missing a great deal of what makes him great, but the Serenade #1 is a thoroughly uncomplicated, optimistic work, so Abbado's approach works. My attention wandered a bit--everything was sweet and genial to a fault--and DG stingily put only this 49 min. piece on the CD. Most buyers, however, will probably encoutner this performance in Abbado's box set of the four symphonies or, better yet, on a bargain twofer generously filled with the Hungarian Dances, two overtures, and Serenade no. 2."
5,Captivating Study,"This is a fascinating work covering a sadly neglected subject. Schwoerer does an excellent job tracing the antiarmy ideology from its infant state at the beginning of the century to its apotheothis at the latter end in the works of John Trenchard and Andrew Fletcher. In addition, she offers a brief but solid account of the influence of these ideas throughout the eighteenth century, with special emphasis on the American Revolutionaries. It is truly unfortunate that this work is out of print, as it is virtually the only thorough work on this particular subject."
4,Roots down-live,The album clearly represents the Rusted Roots at there finest. The album is a collection of hits done in a live setting. Great record
2,Too Soft,"Unfortunately, I've had to use cushions like these for years. They work only if they're firm enough to hold the body up, making the hole in the back for the tailbone functional. In my case at least, I didn't find the pillow to be firm enough, so it didn't alleviate my pain."
4,Coccyx Cushion,"The cushion is very comfortable and works fine for me, but the actual dimensions are more like 17""x14"" instead of 16""x13""."
2,Size is for overweight folks,"This was just too big for petite people. I got this for someone, but realized it was way to big for her. they don't make these for petite people."
3,cushion is a little hard,"I like the small size -easy to slide into my car under the steering wheel, but I was a little surprised at how hard the cushion is. Otherwise, it is a good buy."
1,not the best seat in the house!,"I bought two of these--one for home and one for office. There's so much hype these days about memory foam that I thought perhaps it would be better for my back aches than the less expensive regular foam . What a memory it has! As soon as you sit on it, it compresses, and then it never goes back into shape. It was really comfortable the first time used, but after that it is almost useless. Since memory foam is so popular these days, it must have some characteristic that I am not appreciating. If you like memory foam, this is a very nice cushion. I woul rather have one that continues to support ."
4,Sitting on a cloud,Ths cushion makes long trips (or even short trips) seem so much shorter because I am comfortable and by body does not ache when I have arrived at my destination. CMA.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED/JUST FOAM,This to me is a huge ripoff. My husband is having horrible pain from the tail bone area from an injury. He begged for something for days and I purchased this item due to good reviews. Well this is junk--just a piece of foam shaped in a cheap fabric. Maybe a purchase of 5.00 instead of almost 30.00 with s&h. Now I have to buy him something else. I was shocked that this is a piece of foam in a cheap material--for the price they could have done better.
5,A great cushion and a big help.,The shooting pain I had is no longer there. I am very happy with this pillow and recommend it to anyone looking for relief and wondering if this will help.
4,The Elusive Coccydynia,"it's literally a pain in the rear end, no pun.I have been to doctors and there appears to be no cure for it.This cushion for use on long drives or just to sit on at home, is an excellent solution.IN two months my pain is 50%better.It's reasonably priced and well made. There are more expensive cushions but this fitted the bill for me."
4,Very comforable,I purchased this item for my lower back after I fell and landed on my rear. I was finding it very uncomfortable to sit for long periods. This cushion is helping me. It is firm and comfortable and seems to be holding up well.
1,Not worth the money,I am pregnant and sit at a desk all day at work so i bought this product because I thought it would help with my tailbone/lower back pain. Unfortunatly it is so uncomfortable i can't sit on it for more then an hour at a time so it is hard to tell if it helps at all with my back issues. The cushion is very dense and doesn't sink at all with my weight which causes my behind to hurt. I wish i had just saved my money for a back massage or something. Unfortunatly this product ins't returnable at all so now i'm stuck with it.
2,"Worked, but a horrible smell","This cushion did do the job it was supposed to by alleviating the pressure on my tailbone; however, I ended up returning it because of the horrible smell. The cushion smelled like paint, but the worst part was that the smell transferred to my chair and my clothing. The seller was very courteous to allow for a return and stated that this was the first time they had heard of a smell issue; I cannot say either way since I ended up dishing out the money for the Tush Cush. I also agree with some of the other reviewers that the material for the cushion appears very cheap.The Tush Cush is much nicer and does not have an awful smell; however, I am disappointed that I had to pay $50 to get it. The Coccyx Cushion's price is right; however, they need to work on the product quality to get my purchase in the future."
1,useless!,"I bought this for my wife who just had colo-rectal surgery to take pressure of coccyx. She only ways 125# and this cushion doesn't keep its form. After 5 minutes, it's like she's sitting on a sheet of paper...definitely not worth the purchase."
2,cheap,This is basically a cheap piece of foam you can get from a craft store with a cloth cover. You could make this yourself for about $3.
2,Too soft,"""Extra soft"" is right. This cushion is completely squishable and offers no support whatsoever. It almost completely flattens out when I sit on it. I was very disappointed with this cushion."
4,Good Product. Would buy another one.,This is a good product for anyone with a tail bone injury. It almost eliminates my tailbone pain when I sit on it. Well made and comfortable. Durable. I am considering buying another one so I don't have to transport it back and forth to work.
5,Best help for your back,"Been using it for 2 years now, it's the best help I got from any product created to help back pain. I use it with a simple plastic apple chair and have junked my expensive executive chair."
2,Quality is not there,"I have a friend who purchased a cushion like this from another store. It felt great to sit on and relieved my coccyx pressure completely and immediately. My cushion flattens completely. I am not heavy, however, it does not retain any of it's shape when I sit on it. It's therefore useless in giving me any coccyx relief. I don't know if mine was not of the same quality as others, but it is useless to me. I am very disappointed. I was so hopeful!"
1,Useless,"Due to the law of gravity, my rear-end started to sag, no longer providing support to protect my tail bone when I sit in the car for a long time. This seem like a good idea, but it does not work.. Save your money.."
3,Cushion Review,"The cushion was not what I expected. It was too high at seat back end, and it came in brown which was not what I wanted. I would have preferred black, but I don't recall there being a choice or even having color mentioned. The thickness problem seems to be curing itself over time. And it does make sitting at my office chair more comfortable"
2,coccyx cushion,Arrived promptly but was too firm for my mother-in-law. Was very expensive to have it not be comfortable.
2,Just okay...,Seemed great at first. I bought two. One for my car and one for my chair at workl. Both have flattened out after one week of use.
5,Great cushion!!,I ordered this cushion recently for my chair at work and have been very pleased so far. I sit for 7-8hrs. a day at a microscope and was having trouble with my legs and (....) going numb by the end of the day. This cushion allows me to sit comfortably at my desk all day without pain. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who sits for long periods of time.
1,Terrible smell; not as picured/described,"I received my cushion from Medical Dept. Stores. It came in a sealed plastic bag. When opened, the cushion reeked of gasoline/diesel/fuel oil--all come to mind. After one week, it still reeked and left a smell on my clothes to carry around with me. Also, it was not as described or pictured. There was no removable blue cover, but a faux leather/suede cover and handle. The memory foam performed great--the little I actually used it. After a week, I returned it to the seller. I have used visco memory foam products in the past and nothing smelled like that or for so long! The cushion also looked very tacky and cheap with the faux leather covering. When I returned it, the Medical told me that that smell is considered normal and charged me a re-stocking fee out of my refund. I now own an Astar brand one with removable navy cover and had no problems with it. Would not recommend this seller."
1,Worthless cushion....does not cushion at all.,"I have chronic tailbone pain, making it very uncomfortable to sit. I bought this cushion hoping that it would sufficiently elevate my tailbone from the chair so it is in less pain. I only weigh ~100 pounds and upon siting on this very thin cushion, the foam collapses completely and it's as if I'm siting on nothing. This cushion was a very big disappointment and did little to relieve my pain. Furthermore, there are no straps on this seat cushion so it always slips off of chairs. Bottom line, don't waste your money on this worthless cushion."
2,not nearly as good as I expected,"I was disappointed in this product, it was not nearly as comfortable as I was anticipating it to be. I should have invested in a nicer one. This one was kind of thin and not very supportive. After 2 weeks it seemed like I was sitting on a wadded up blanket."
3,Inconsistent firmness,I ordered this product in two separate orders and received completely different firmness. I am wondering if the supplier is mixing up the firmness.
3,Could definitely better.,"It is cushy, but the hole in the center is awkward. Unfortunately, on leather seats, it slides around. Different colors would be nice."
2,Coccyx cushion,The item does help some. I anticipated the memory foam to be denser which it needs to be. It is already very flat and hardly helpful.
1,Seat cushion,"Very cheaply made, and the cushion is not supportive at all. The ""washable cover"" is so flimsy, I don't think it would stand up to a rinsing, much less washing. If it wasn't a hastle to return it, I would..."
2,Mildly helpful,"I have been using this product until recently in my car. The cutout works great but the foam is another matter. If it is cold out, its hard as a rock and I'm too high in my seat. Once it warms up or if the weather is hot, it squishes down so much that it doesn't keep my coccyx off the seat.Better than nothing but I've given up on it and am now trying another product."
3,Work's fine,"I start using this cushion and it works fine, just that when you seat the preassure of the body made the hole even bigger and it feel a little unconfortable."
4,Great cushion--worth the price,Great cusion and worth the extra $$. I had bought a cheaper one prior to this but it was a waste of money and did not support the area around the coccyx to to take the pressure off. This cushion works great in car or office chair....highly recommend for coccyx injury
2,Too soft,Way too soft. I looked around on the internet for a supportive pillow found this one with great reviews but don't trust the reviews! This pillow is so soft it's not supporting what it says it will! After using this for a few days I'm still in as much pain as I was without it. Save you money looks elsewhere.
2,"Disappointed with Product and ""Customer Service""","I have broken coccyx and ordered this cushion, since I have something similar that I ordered from Relax the Back. I sat on it (still in the plastic) for less than 5 minutes. It flattened to the point that it was useless...and no, I am not overweight. Although I emailed Alegro Medical imediately, asking for a return label, it took months for them to send one...bottom line was 4 MONTHS and some pretty harsh emails to get them to REFUND MY MONEY."
5,Excellent !,"This was an excellenat transaction. Shipping was fast and the cushion was just as described. Works great, too ! Thank you."
4,Butt Pad!,"Never used it, bought it for sister that always complaining about hard seats.It was a gag gift but she loves it. So I will have to take her word for it."
1,Review of the reviews,"I have not read this book. I found the reviews very helpful however. If Mrs. Hordyck is such a great teacher, why are these reviews so badly written (by Dan the Man, Nicki Rodriguez and Nicole Farmer-Flournoy)? Check out the grammar: ""its"" for ""it's""; ""your"" for ""you're""; confidant and entire are misspelled, et cetera. Yikes! I'm crossing this one off my wish list."
5,Thankyou for everything,"I was a student of Mrs. Hordyk from 1996 to 1998. She has been an inspiration to me, and i thank her for where i am now. Her teaching style made me laugh every day and made me feel good about coming to class. I enjoyed her teaching so much, i repeated one of her classes just for fun. I am a junior at University of Washingtion majoring in Economics and Society and Justice, and to this day i still can't thank of a better teacher and friend. Thankyou for everything, may your books and life be successfull."
2,I foresee the velcro strip wearing out with use,I think I am better off with a backpack. It holds more and I don't have to velcro and unvelcro it everytime I ride.
1,Stash this bag Away from me!,"I wanted an easy access compact handlebar bag facing me while riding my cruiser. The Bell bag is stiff and bulky; not enough inside pockets (just two)to organize your stuff for quick access so its awkward to open while riding. Worse yet, it sticks out just enough to hit my knees when I'm riding. It doesn't tie down well on the back rack either. Don't waste you money on this one. I can't find any use for this bag except to give it to a kid to hang in front of their one speed bike like a basket."
3,It's still winter,"Looks like a useable product, but it's too wintry to put on my bicycle and try out. This goes for the other bicycle products I got.Thanks."
4,Nice bag for the money...,"My only regret with this bag was that I purchased it at Sports Authority and paid 3 bucks more for it. Nice size, perfect for a small towel, cell phone, ipod, keys and a small water bottle. It does get in the way of the front reflector/light so I attached it facing me so that I can access it easier. Overall, good bag for the money."
2,Zipper is not durable - broke on first use,"I bought this handlebar bag as well as the Bell StowAway bicycle seat bag. The zippers on both products are metal and extremely flimsy. While using the handlebar bag for the first time, the zipper broke. To be more specific, the top part of the pull tab broke off.I contacted Bell (which was a chore in itself) and after several emails I was given a replacement bag. Not the same exact bag, but a smaller one with a better zipper. Which was fine with me because an exact replacement wouldn't have lasted long anyway.I'm very careful with my StowAway bag as it's still in working condition after using it for 4 weeks.The reflective strips and its size are the only reasons why this bag has two stars."
2,Bell Handlebar Bag,"I bought this bag (from k-mart) primarily because it was small enough to mount on my handlebar and not obscure my handlebar mounted headlight, but large enough to carry my relatively small u-lock and also my cable lock. I've had mine for about 8 months now and it's falling apart. I've always had problems with the zippers, they had a tendency to split open when I had both locks in the bag. Not an over-sized load, but u-locks are kind of heavy. So I just left the zipper zipped up to the middle of the bag. Just recently, the zippers have begun to detach from the bag at the seems. At $15, not including shipping, there are plenty of other bags available on Amazon, surely one of them offers better construction quality than this one."
4,BridgeBarron review,The game overall is quite enjoyable. It is very close to a regular game with regular people.
3,The Incomplete Bridge Baron,"I have purchased other bridge games over the years and find most of them lacking. I have always known of Bridge Baron from the American Contract Bridge League where I have earned many master points. When I purchased a new computer this summer I decided to buy Bridge Baron, feeling it was probably the best. I find some areas of bidding less than challenging AND when I finished the first 500 hands, it popped up with an offer to BUY more bridge hands!!! I thought that at over $32 for this disc, as opposed to ~$10 for other discs that have several other games on them, was too much. I would like to have a game with the modern bidding conventions on it, but I have spent all I plan to on this endeavor."
5,Great game for the novice computer user,"My mother-in-law (86) had a new laptop and had grown weary of trying to play bridge on-line. We bought this for her, and helped her install it. She took it over from there and is playing every day. She's actually looking forward to upcoming long winter days for once!"
5,Must have if you want to measure the outside of a bent tube,"If you want to get the angle from the outside of a bent piece of tube >, you must have this. You open the device and slide the leg extender over the open end of the top channel giving you a surface to work with."
1,Not really useful,"I bought this think it would extend the length by 18"". NO, it just extends over the knuckle by 4"". not really useful. Don't buy this if you think it;s going to give your long side legs. It doesn't"
1,The Radio Might Not Play it..........,"THIS IS A POSTHUMOUS RELEASE BY THE RAUL ROCK CLUB, HIS LARGEST FAN CLUB IN BRAZIL. SYLVIO PASSOS, THE PRESIDENT, PAINSTAKINGLY PUT THIS RECORDING TOGETHER FROM A POOR QUALITY AUDIO TAPE. EVEN THOUGH THE SOUND IS POOR, IT REMAINS AN INTERESTING DOCUMENT. IF YOU UNDERSTAND PORTUGUESE, RAUL'S COMMENTS BETWEEN THE TUNES ARE EASILY AS INTERESTING AS THE MUSIC ! FOR DIEHARD FANS..........."
4,Old Technology,I prefer the old technology over the new laser plumb technology. I always kid the young guys that plumb bobs have a self calibrating function built in.
4,Recommended,"Nice tool. Easy to use with pin and recoil feature. Used to frame some basement walls. Hang from joists and using 0 out pin feature, spot location of walls was a snap. Hanging drywall, used to spot stud locations for screw shooting. Bob rests quickly as stated. Only real dowside is lightweight plastic cover could be beefed up some or made out of aluminum or steel."
2,"Great in theory, but...","Since assessing the trueness and plumbness of HM door frames is essential in our line of work I presumed that is tool would prove invaluable.However, in practice it was not as convenient as billed nor as easy to use as a simple bubble level.Will we use it - most likely on occasion to impress a customer, not for much more."
5,Tajima Plumb Bob,"And I thought a plumb bob was a lump of metal tied to a piece of string....!! The Tajima plumb bob is quite simply a superb piece of Japanese product engineering. You can hook it, hang it, pin it on and its also magnetic - the high-vis cord self-retracts, it doesn't rotate. The gimbal-mounted bob is quickly self-damping and settles in seconds; the line can be three fixed distances from the back of the case - 60mm, 50mm or zero. If a heavier bob is fitted, the tracking arrangement of the cord is changed to compensate for weights up to 1Kg. It is beautifully constructed in mirror finish high quality ABS plastic, the bob is accurately turned and chromium plated. Its one of the best pieces of kit in my tool box. I bought mine in Hong Kong on 12.12.01 for HK$80, that's UKSterling 7.12 or US$10.40 by the way...."
3,"Giving too much credit to Fisher, and the Royal Navy","This is a superby researched book, though it falls flat on its major premise, that Fisher and the Royal Navy were ahead of the times in terms of naval strategy, armaments or hwat not.Also the book is a misnomer, as it's more on the rivalries amongst the Board of Amiralty than on Fisher, and its dubious claim that Fisher pioneered the so called ""flotilla defense"" by submarines and torpedo boats stretches credulity, as Fisher is notorious for NOT beleving in a Naval War Staff, or any war plans at all.The author also neglects, being a fan of Fisher, to point out that the latter's morbid fascination with ""battle cruiser"" led to the fiasco in Jutland, though all British historians and apologist will claim that they may have lost a battle there, but ultimately won the war!"
3,Elvis has entered the building!,"Be prepared to hear CC Rider when you slip on these dungarees, because perhaps only Elvis has pants legs and flaired bottoms bigger. The pants legs are listed ""boot cut"" which should actually be renamed to ""The King Cut"" as you can drive Elvis's Takin' Care of Business jet plane or tour bus through them. What kind of boots one would be wearing to need to slip into these on is beyond me...perhaps astronaut moon boots, or mountaineering hi-altitude. Or maby yer a cowboy with size 16 feet.Measured, the legs are almost the same as the waist measurement of 33"" and I'm not joking. Unless yer lookin' for a ""homie carpenter"" look, or ""construction gangsta banga"" thing, take Obi Wan's advise, these are not the jeans your looking for. I wouldn't dream of wearing these casually, and they are not as rugged as the ""real"" work jeans by Carhart by any means. Again, if yer into the gangst look, go for it.[...]"
3,"ok, i guess",My husband loves Carharts as work clothes. However....a tiny whole appeared out of the blue on one of the pair which my husband did not even wear yet. It was disappointing to see a defect like this in the product famous for its sturdiness.
5,Great Work Pants and Much More,"The most comfortable work pants I've ever worn. They are durable and stylish. I packed the dungaree pants in my luggage on a recent trip to Charleston, SC. While there, my brother in-law did not pack any nice dress pants for a dinner with my brother and his family. I offered up my Carhartts for him to wear. We went to the dinner at a very nice Country Club and no one there could have realized otherwise that the Carhartts are dungarees that I wear to work in. In fact, I was wearing the same style dungaree (different color) today walking around downtown Knoxville, TN. On the way home, the right rear tire on my pickup went flat and I changed the tire without worrying about whether they will get dirty or damaged while changing the tire. I absolutely recommend these Carhartts for anyone looking for a great working dungaree."
2,Made in USA? Think again...,"I've been buying Carhartt pants for a decent while now as they have fit me consistently and I love how durable they are, as well as the fact that they are, or were made in the USA. I bought a set of six in varying colors, and found that they're now made in Mexico or Nicaragua. Possibly other places as well depending on what color you get.Needless to say, I am greatly disappointed this fact. I very much prefer to buy USA made items when I'm able and Carhartt has definitely let me down.This review does not reflect the experience I had with Amazon itself, they were shipped quickly and packaged well."
3,their are still men in the world with and ass .,"I have alway's liked this product, but it look's to me like all jean makers have decided if your overweight,your ass just had to have fallen off,I still like these jeans but please add just a little more room in the seat please."
4,Standard Carhartt quality but runs Small,"There isn't much to review that no one doesn't already know about Carhartt - Tough, durable, and able to get you through the work day and weekend warrior project. Love these pants.The only piece I haven't figured out is the correct size for me. I'm usually a 33/34 waist and 32 inseam. The first pair I ordered were 34/32 and I could barely button them up. I sent them back and got a 35/32. Better but still not quite right. I was in a rush so i stuck with them. After washing them, I am fairly certain they shrunk just a bit more.Next go around, I will likely go 36/34. Once I get it dialed in, there will be a few more pairs in the closet."
5,Love these pants - so heavy duty!,"I've been wearing these for years now and I love 'em. They're extremely tough, comfortable, and they look nice.The only negative I can think of is that the color fades out pretty badly with repeated washing. I'm retiring my oldest pairs because they have faded too much and don't look professional enough for work anymore."
4,Great work pants but pockets need to be reinforced,"I purchased these pants for my husband which he wears everyday for work. They are durable pants, more durable than the cotton pants his work provides but the only flaw is that my husband carries screws, bolts, etc. in his pocket while he works and because of that it wears out the front areas of the pants where the pockets are. Now they are frayed with small holes. I wish they would reinforce the pocket lining to prevent this from happening.I would purchase them again however."
4,Old stand by,"I've been buying these pants for 20 years and I wear them almost every day. They last a long time and are the best to work in. However, I have two problems with them: They are now no longer made in the USA but instead in Central America sweatshops. AND secondly, despite the previous statement they continue to go up in price. In fact they are about 30% more than a year ago when all production seems to have moved. I will say the pants otherwise seem the same, but it's a bit much that Carhartt advertisements all feature ""the American working man"" but then make their products in Honduras and Mexico."
3,try them on,"ive worn a 34-30 pant forever. the 34"" waist runs very small. i tried on 36"" and was swimming in them. i found some 35"" and they are a bit big too. i'm not the only one who said this. guys at work say the same thing."
2,Sent them back,"The waist size and length were true to the size. The seat and legs though, were comically over-sized. The quality of the denim, zipper, and pockets, etc. was top notch. Just sized too much like clown's apparel in the thighs and seat, in my humble opinion."
1,Not Made For The Working Man - Horribe Quality,Bought 3 pairs of the Carhartt B11 Work Pants. All 3 have huge tears in the crotch/backside area after only 5 months!!! Look at the pictures. Threw out one pair already it was so bad. These Carhartt work pants are definately not for the working man. They were purchased at Work N Gear which is a authorized retailer for Carhartt - these are not knockoffs.Will be looking at another brand for my work clothes from now on.
3,Tight Squeeze,"I bought my first pair of these and was a little disappointed. I ordered a 'relaxed fit' but there's nothing relaxed about these pants!There is nothing to indicate that they fit as snuggly as they do and when I buy something I expect it to meet certain standards. These do not!!! Although they are beautifully constructed, superb material and quality they are very misleading on how they fit and that's what's important to many, I'm sure. For the price it's well worth the money, I guess, if only I could feel comfortable in them.I'll be returning these but looking for more that meet my expectations."
5,fantastic durability,This is the only pants my husband wears. He is more thanhappy to get a new pair. He loves the shorts too
1,Wrong,"The description says they are washed duck, but they send you the canvas ones instead, which are a cheaper fabric."
5,Perfect & Worth Every Penny,"After having just purchased these pants in Realtree camo for my husband, he wanted the same pants in black for work. I followed the advice of some reviewers who wrote they felt the pants ran small in the waist and ordered a 35"" waist instead of 34"", which did fit in the camo pants. I was glad I did, because when he tried them on, they fit perfectly. I highly recommend these in addition to my recommendation on the camo version. It's a great product and really reasonably priced, considering they're Carhartts."
5,"Best work pants, period.","I've tried all the Dickies, Wranglers, Wolverine, Craftsman...CARHARTT DUNGAREE'S are easily the toughest and most comfortable.The best thing is, it doesn't matter what job I'm doing, these can handle it.I don't know what I would do without the leg pockets now, I'm so used to carrying tools there. Flashlight on the left, 13mm and mech pencil on the right. The rear pockets are deep and tough as well, 2-19mm wrenches all day, everyday.I do usually cut the hammer loop off though, then I can wear them without looking like a contractor. (Nothing wrong with Contractor's, I'm just not one)You will be surprised how casual they look with that loop gone.Bottom line, if your reading reviews about these work/play/whatever pants, do yourself a favor, pony up and get into some."
4,Just about perfect,"These pants come so close to being perfect! The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions. They are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap bag. A few washes later and they're getting much better. If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint white marks. I have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly. They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee, they it looks baggy. My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets. Aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens? None of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro. I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out. Other than that, I love them. They are constructed like Fort Knox. The crotch definitely isn't going to split anytime soon. I can see these lasting for years."
2,Run big......,Pants were made very well but run very full in the legs and hips. Will be returning them for a slimmer cut.
2,Ripped after 10 uses,"Ripped crawling around in an area that I frequently move around in, and have never ripped any jeans or my pair of carhartt canvas work dungarees. I thought the thinner material would be worth it in the heat, but they are way too delicate."
4,So Happy,got these for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves carhartt and wears non stop.. he was super excited with this pants;)
3,last MK II album in 1973,"Gillan and Glover left the band after this album released in 1973, both of them were replaced by Coverdale and hughes in the same year.My Woman from Tokyo is a timeless song, Rat Bat blue is a timeless powerfull song, our lady is a slow rock but effective, Smooth dancer is a quitepowerfull song with the guitar and organ sound. buy this one, a must for all DP fans."
4,Not the best of Mark II but usually an underrated record,"Despite the fact that this is a minor letdown it still is excellent - just look at the tracklist and tell me if there is more than one throwaway here... nope! The original album is rather short, only about 35 minutes but the first five tracks are superb, especially ""Woman From Tokyo"" and ""Rat Bat Blue"" with the latter simply blowing everything away. Originality is mostly gone, that's true... but what can you expect in 1973 from classic hard-rock band which was doing this for the last 3-4 years together with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and all the other hard-rock bands of the day (and there were plenty of those, oh yeah!). So I won't subtract too many points for that but add a bit for the quality."
4,Don't Judge A Book By Its' Cover (or Title),"The only reason I can think of, that led this album to be somewhat of a relative failure, both, in sales and artistically is the title. How can you expect success when you follow three ""Bombers"" like 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' with the self-doubting 'who do we think we are?'. In the world of heavy-metal, there's no room for these sort of confessions and self-mockery isn't received too well by fans, either. This is a title for wimps, for Singer/songwriters, pop bands perhaps. And indeed, this is in Purple terms, quite poppy, but as such, it holds, apart from the famous (and only 'hit' on this album)'Women From Tokyo', also a real pearl called 'Our Lady' - a reminder of some Beatles influences. Forget the title, this one is as good as the three classics mentioned above by this Line-up (Mark 2 with Gillan and Glover)."
3,Machine Head Hangover...,"Pretty tough to follow-up on one of the best metal albums ever.Yet ""Who Do We.."" still hangs in as one of Mark II's better albums. Ritchie Blackmore delivers one of his finest solos ever on ""Place In Line"". I would have liked a flat out rocker to end the album like ""Space Truckin'"" did on MH. Instead the album goes out on a major, major whimper with ""Our Lady""; hence the three star rating.This was the first Deep Purple album I ever owned. I got it for X-Mas back in 1973 when I was in 6th grade. I immediately went out and purchased ""Made In Japan"" & ""Machine Head"" with the rest of my Christmas money. My advice would be to start with those two albums, followed by ""In Rock""."
3,WHO DO YOU THINK THEY ARE?,"""WHO DO WE THINK WE ARE""album was the last LP that DEEP PURPLE made with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover for the 1970's.... Purple were very tired,because they didn't stop making concerts all over the world...As Ian Gillan said,they were seen by the managers as money machine....Moreover,Ritchie and Ian had their first serious fights...it was difficult to make good music,at that time... However,""W.D.W.T.W.R?""has it's times...Unquestionably ""Woman from Tokyo""is the best one....and then maybe ""Smooth Dancer"" and ""Mary Long"".The rest of them are just album fillers....If you are a big fan of Purple buy it!If you don't,better buy In Rock,Machine Head,Fireball or Perfect Strangers....."
3,not bad,"the album is not bad, but the whole songs are interresting too, not so excellent to compare as Fireball, machine head, BURN,..."
3,last DP MK II album in 1973,"Gillan and Glover left the band after this released in 1973, were replaced by Coverdale and hughes in the same year. My Woman from tokyo is a timeless song, Rat Bat blue is a timeless powerfull song, our lady is a slow rock but effective, Smooth dancer is a quite powerfull song with the guitar and organ sound. buy this one, a must fro DP fans."
2,A huge disapointment,"I am a big Deep Purple fan,but it is obvious that this album seemed rushed. From what I understand,it was around this time(1973)that Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore were at wit's end amongst each other,and it shows. The only track that stands out is ""WOMAN FROM TOKYO"". Songwriting has never been the strong suit of DP and this album as a whole obviously makes that clear if some of the other albums(however awesome they might have been)didnt quite glare it otherwise. If you need an example just check out ""MARY LONG""(definitly their worst song!) Any track that opens with :""Mary Long is a hypocrite"" and then has to spend the next lyric flatly defining what that means...well just listen to the song and that will sum up the inanity of this very disappointing album. If you are a big Purple fan like me though,it is worthy of buying to add to the library for the sake of completeness."
3,"Good, but not their best","This line-up was on it's last legs. The Purple are always impressive, but this is not their best effort. Blackmore was holding back his best riffs for his solo outing (Rainbow)."
2,Mostly for Deep Purple fans,"""Who do we think we are"" is in fact a rather uninspired album. Maybe the guys blow it all on the previous and excellent ""Machine head"" and simply ran out of ideas. The best songs on the album are ""Mary Long"" and ""Woman from Tokyo"", and they are indeed good. The rest is nothing to be excited about."
1,"If You Like Your Gospel Without Much Spirit, Soul or Effort ... Here Ya Go","If you prefer your gospel sung professionally without any real spirit, soul or effort - this is your gospel CD. Everyone seems to give it a professional effort and it is music, and it is gospel but it's really fine background - elevator music. It's hard to figure out who this CD was recorded for - after all, who wants gospel music that's bland and generic? Who wouldn't prefer to listen an amateur but who is heartfelt? Who prefer music that seems to have been generated by a voice machine - ""perfect"" in every manner but for a gospel CD is ENTIRELY soul-less?Weird."
4,The right strings for me and my guitar,"If you've been around the block you know there is no perfect guitar string. That said, I've tried a half dozen strings on my Gibson and these ones sound the best IMO. Your guitar, hands, and playing style are probably different... So who knows what you'll make of these. To me these seem both warmer and more defined than any others I've put on here. That's unusual, but rings true. My other guitar does not take to them as well. Go figure. :/"
2,not high quality,"this is a non expensive personal player. my son stopped using it because the earphone plug failed to work after two months. camera is of a very low quality, they do not even look like a one MP."
2,VERY Slippery....,"The gauge is fine, but should you sweat the lightest bit, you loose all control over the pick. I've used most everything and these are probably the worst I've used in terms of grip."
2,Could use a little finishing,"While these picks have the body and stiffness I look for, they also have little burrs left from production that need to be filed off before use. If you don't mind spending some time getting them ready for use, these are good picks."
2,"promising start, lame book","I was looking forward to reading this book. It sounded like it would be an enjoyable read. A nymphomaniac attacking a hospital patient, a black cat, a witch. The best part about this book was the blurb on the back cover. The rest was pretty boring.The story started out with a lot of promise, it contained humour, mystery, suspense, all the elements needed for a great novel ride. This soon fizzled out and I had to push the book to the finish line. I am not certain what happened, Ms Proulx had all the elements and got off to such a great start, but she seemed to not know where to take it. The characters weren't thatinteresting and the ending was too predictable.If I had it to do over again, I would not waste any time on this book, there are too many good ones out there. This is the first book from this author I have read, I hope all her books are not like this."
2,**,"I found the way this book is organized terrible. It tells you more HOW to see things than WHAT to see. It's like wanting to know when a movie starts, and you check the paper and find directions on how to get to the theater, advice on the best place to park, you're told what food is really yummy at the snack counter, and you're pulling your hair out because you can't find when the movie starts!!!"
4,Pete and Arlo Together,"I bought this record in 1977 and decided to get the CD so I can play it in my car. I am amazed at how much my old folk albums appeal to me still and again thirty, forty and more years later."
4,canoeing with the cree,"I thought that this book was a great wiild life adventure. It's about two boys going aginst their odds in a canoeing trip from St. Paul Minneapolis all the way to the Hudson Bay. Nobody thinks that they will make it. The two young boys come close to death many times. They almost get lost and find their way thanks to many kind people that help them overcome the impossible and they make it. They encounter Indians and some very nice people, and this makes their trip much easier even though they really struggle through all those miles. That's why I think this book was a good book."
1,Useless small and too soft sponge,"I have been through many natural sponges over the years. This particular sponge was a great disappointment. It is quite small, and far too soft. Not sure how to best describe it but it is really not very ""spongy"" when wet. It sort of squishes down to a little wet lump when you wet it in warm water and try to use it."
2,Reviewed again,"The initial 5-6 inch sponge was very unsatisfactory so I gave a review stating this. The seller came back with an offer to send me 2 sponges if I would remove the negative feedback. So I said ok, and removed it. In return I was send 2 sponges which are about 3"" each. Ick. This seller is awful. BUYER BEWARE!!!! They are not worth it."
2,Tore within the first week,"Owned another sponge from another company for over 2 years, loved it. This one tore within a week of use. Won't buy again."
2,Disappointed-Sponge is falling apart,"There are many things I liked about this natural sponge, particularly its resistance to bacteria. It is soft, came as advertised. However, after little more than a month it is falling apart. This sponge is not durable."
2,Too soft for any good,"The description said great for bathing, but not if you need something more study than a pair of panty hose. This is too soft to bath with, but might be really good for a baby."
3,Repetetive,"Packard's book held little suprises for those of us who are devoted Victoriana fans..It was more like a rehash of facts about Voctoria's daughters from forty other books i possess..However, for the generation of eager Victorian yet to have read past books; this book is an overall ""primer"" to explain the complex relation between VR and her daughters.Well written and interesting from beginning to end."
3,too deep for me,"This book was very detailed in the data and vignettes from Victorian history. Unfortunately, much of it was nearly incomprehensible to those not well versed in this era. This would be a good supplement to add to the library of a Victorian enthusiast. Someone just wishing to increase their knowledge of the era would be better off starting with something more broad. The photos are a good supplement, however."
3,Victorias daughters,It was a bit dry and did not give enough personnel information to hold my interest. By not giving a little bit of information on the boys it lacked context and became confusing. I still read it though twice.
3,Interesting read but not an easy read,"I am fascinated by the stories because they are all real, but the wordage chosen by the author makes for a slow read. Thank God I am using a kindle with a built in dictionary!"
5,Five Stars,"A very good biography on Queen Victoria's five daughters Victoria, Alice, Helena, Louise , and Beatrice. All five growing up under a domineering and interfering mother who was also queen which none of them were ever allowed to forget. Victoria grew up the favorite daughter while Alice became the more humble and more interested in helping others especially nursing. The youngest three found it more difficult to try and have their own marriages after the death of their father the last on Beatrice in particular ended up fighting over a year in order to get her marriage because her mother didn't want to lose her helper. In the end Beatrice got her marriage but was still not allowed to leave her mother's side as her mother's messager Beatrice was often isolated from her other siblings. In fact upon her mother's death didn't quite know what to do with herself. I enjoyed reading about their childhood especially. An excellent read."
4,"Victoria, Mother to Europe",This is a good book in a crash course on Victorian England. The reader discovers just how important Victoria was in placing her children and grandchildren on thrones across the continent.
3,Very entertaining,"This book about Victoria's daughters was very entertaining and informative but sometimes a little contradictory and shaky on the facts. There is alot of information that you don't get in other books about Victoria and her family which is really interesting. The only problems are that the author contradicts himself, especially in regard to the oldest, Victoria. An Uncommon Women describes her much better. Overall this was a very informative book and I'd recommend it, but I'd also recommend that other books about the subject be read also."
2,difficult,"With that many daughters it was a little difficult to keep track, especially of the younger daughters. Too much emphasis and repetition about the eldest daughter. That said, the book shed light on some of the daughters about whom I knew very little."
4,Glad I bought it,This is another subject of fascination for me and I always find that whatever one reads he/she is always able to discover a touch more so the purchase of the book in question was well worth the price.
4,Tells the Life of 5 forgotten princesses,I hold this book accountable for my passion for the British monarchy. It's the first book I read on this topic and after I finished it I went out and bought as many biographies on Victoria as I could find.I strongly reccomend this book to beginners or buffs. You won't be disappointed.For more on Vicky see the biography by Hannah Pakula and I believe there is a biography of Helena (Lenchen) out there somewhere.
5,Very interesting...,"A very well written book about Vicky, Alice, Lenchen, Louise, and Beatrice, the daughters who were hidden behind their mother as children and eventually behind their brother and nephew. The book also looks into the lives of the girls' children, some of whom became rulers of great countries. A very good book for those interested in Queen Victoria and her family."
5,A must read for educators,This book takes a unique view of documenting a classroom setting through the use of video. I found the interplay between the descriptions in the book and the web site videos an enlightening experience. Ms. Goldman-Segall takes you into the Hennigan school (among other places) and lets you feel what is happening in this experimental educational setting. Her observations of the MIT project give a new and different perspective to the roles of the students and teachers in these settings. This is a book that takes full advantage of the tools of technology that we would like students to be using. This will give teachers a better understanding of their role in implementing technology and how it can make them more effective educators.
4,"The ""Sandy Man""","My 3 1/2 year old believes in the sandman. Every morning when she wakes up and attempts to clear her eyes she declares - - the Sandman got me! I was searhing for a book that would ""so to speak,"" explain the sandman to her. We were both delighted to find this book and read about the mysterious little man who visits her and every boy and girl each night. This story, about the search for a compatibale friend is very sweet but it is the exquisitely drawn illustrations that sets it apart from other books.A nice read and a beautiful visual to share with your young children."
2,blurry photos,"This book would be great if the photos were sharp. Unfortunately they are not. It makes me envious because other reviewers apparently got a better copy than I did. Looking at the book's info page, I seem to have the 21st printing. Maybe I could search out an earlier printing.UPDATE: 30 Oct 2012. I was able to obtain a used copy of the 11th printing of the book. (This has a different cover photo.) Some of the item photos are better, some are not. Between the two copies, I think it will be possible to cull an acceptable photo of most of the specimens illustrated. I have to say though, compared to other field guides, encyclopedias, and handbooks which I have, this batch of photos is very uneven in grade, and sometimes less than marginal in quality."
4,Simon & Schuster's Guide to Rocks & Minerals,Great product...very concise yet covers everything that you need to know about rocks and minerals
4,"Thorough list of minerals, survey of rocks","I still like this book, though I use the other popular field guides (the plastic covered Audubon etc.) more. There is a lot of text and occurrence is listed with actual places around the world. The index is poor. Rocks such as shale, mudstone, types of coal that are not anthracite and sandstone are not listed.Symbols next to the plates and text remind you of the kind of rock that is listed. Sedimentary etc symbols are obvious, but handy guides.A new edition should have a better index."
3,"Handsome reference, but for the shelf rather than the field","I would call this more of an ""encyclopedia"" of minerals and rocks rather than a ""guide"", and certainly not a ""field guide"". It is mostly strictly organized according to the technical Strunz taxonomy. But that organization really does not accommodate matching simple field observations to a mineral or rock.For the beginner or someone in the field I would recommend first something like the National Audobon Society Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals by Chesterman. It is in a sense this book in ""reverse"" in that its opening organization starts with appearance color, or color and hardness.However, it is a nice compilation of photos and technical information for each mineral and a selection of rocks - containing two photos per facing page for almost the entire volume - if you have already identified what you have at hand."
3,Accuracy of Claims,"While a reasonably good reference guide, it makes the grievous error of claiming Franklinite and Zincite from Franklin, NJ are ""rare"". True only if you consider a mineral that was estimated to be ""around 800 million tons"" to be rare. It was mined in both Franklin and Ogdensburg {Sterling Hill} for over 100 years because it was so plentiful.These minerals are only rare in the same sense that a Brooklyn, NY phone book is rare.........OUTSIDE of Brooklyn, NY! People on eBay reference this guide to ""prove"" the rarity of the minerals and it's just WRONG!"
2,Different to that shown,"Unhappy with purchase as it is not the same as the advertised picture. Same title and author, but totally different cover. I suspect the book I was sent was an earlier edition. Pity."
4,Very useful field guide,"For rockhounds and beginning geologists, this book is a good overview. It not only gives a very long listing of the more popular rocks and minerals, but a thorough discussion of each along with beautiful photographs. In addition, the author does give a brief overview of crystallography that will serve well the beginner and motivates further reading on the subject. This part of geology and mineralogy is fascinating but can be time-consuming to get through. Even when not out in the field I have found this book fun to read in leisure time. It is packed full of interesting information and for the price cannot be beat."
3,"Not for beginners, but good for advanced hobbyist","The information and photos are great, but it's geared more towards someone who already has a good working knowledge of the subject, especially the introduction to minerals. I would recommend this as a solid field reference, but not so good as a field guide (there's not identification key). Beginners will quickly get lost in some of the technical aspects and jargon."
2,Not what I thought,This book was not at all what I thought. I guess I should have done my research a little better. It turns out that this book had a spiritual/religious undertone to it that I had missed in the description. I had hoped to use this in a public high school classroom but had to think again. It is a good book but not what I had expected.
4,Book speaks from the heart,"Purchased the book for my tween. He found it inspiring and liked that it was clearly written from the heart. It was not a jibberish type of life strategies. The book is fun too, it had some (easy) riddles that make you think. It was easy to comprehend, relate and apply to his daily life. He really likes the layout. The book was layed out as a calander with strategies for the day. I'm glad that I could find him a useful book that he enjoyed!"
4,Good source of hymn program,"I bought this CD set several years ago. I am a church organist and I have found the Virtual Hymnal CD to be incredibly useful. I have used it to transpose hymns down (seldom up) to a key the congregation can sing more comfortably. I have also used it to just provide words of a hymn or to allow me to modulate up for a last stanza. I have even used it to print the words and melody of a hymn in a bulletin or a handout. You could even print on transparencies if you use an overhead projector. All the hymns are public domain and you must work within the program's limitations but if you are even a little comfortable with computer software, you will find this a useful program, worth buying all 4 disks to get one."
2,Not as represented - Does not work with extended life battery,"This item was mis-represented as being just like original equipment. I even made sure that the photos matched before I ordered it too. The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad. It looked like all the other after market units that stated they did not work with long life batteries. An A680 using the extended life battery, which is thicker than the normal battery, will not fit in this holder. In order to use this holder, I have to use my original battery which needs to be recharged every other day -- very inconvenient. I can only say this was cheap enough that it helps mitigate the hassle a bit."
5,Beautiful book with great story!,"It was such a wonderful opportunity to read this lovely book. The book begins with the little cub asking mama ""Where did I come from?"" Mama then goes on to explain - so nicely- how the mama and papa loved each other so much and wanted a baby so much that God put a baby in the mama's stomach. She describes how baby grows bigger and bigger, while all along mama is praying for the baby. It also describes the birth and coming home of baby.This is such a wonderfully worded book, giving the child just enough information without being too detailed. My son is only two, and loves to look at this book, but I feel that it will be very beneficial in the future. We love Lisa Tawn Bergren's books and can't wait to read more in the future!I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,All children need reassurance,"When I read this book at Toys Are Us, I immediately knew I had to get several copies. I had to give this remarkable book to each of the families for whom I provide childcare.So far, most parents have been very grateful. It provides yet one more opportunity to tell their little ones about their ""when I was born"" story and gives many repeated confirmations about God's love.I just reread the book and again became teary. It contains a powerful and positive message. However, for children whose home life is far from ideal, it may not be the best choice since the book describes a completely devoted mom and dad."
4,Was really cute.,"Bought this as Christmas gift for a great-niece. It was really cute! I hope she will enjoy it, has a Godly message."
5,Highly recommend!,Beautifully illustrated and an enjoyable story. My daughter is expecting and I gave it to her for Christmas. She loved it!
5,Delightful,"Lisa Tawn Bergren has written a delightful Christian book for a toddler. The book kept my little ones attention right to the end. Really sweet way to explain how the little bear came to live with his folks. The illustrations are darling, and show a loving family really wanting what God has chosen to give them.I highly recommend this wonderful book!I was provided with a copy of this book by the publisher, and was not required to give a positive review."
5,Amazingly beautiful and moving...,"We gave this book to our 8 year old son as a First Communion gift. The book is the moving story about a young bear asking his mom if his parents love him. The story continues as mama bear explains to the young cub how God have given them the miracle of his birth and walks the cub throught the pregnancy, the waiting over the birth of the baby, the first night at home, and so on. Our 8 year old son loves to cuddle at night and listen to the story of a mom and dad who are so thankful to God for the gift of their cub. Beautifully illustrated and written, this book is a gift to share between parents and their children."
5,Great Book,"I would highly recommend this book. I love reading this book to my son. It describes how special and what a gift from God a child is. As he gets older I hope that this book reinforces that he is a gift from God and his father and I wouldn't want any other child in the world. If we decide to have another child, I plan on getting, ""God Gave us Two."""
3,Beautiful message tainted by social stigma,"Overall the book has a wonderful message to share, putting God as the focus of new life, which I appreciate and adore. I was a bit disenchanted at the turn the book took as the expectant polar bears ""rushed to the hospital"". I was also more than a little disappointed to see baby bottles depicted on the following page. I had hoped such a sweet book would follow through with a more natural, less high tech feel as the book came to a close. Surely polar bears would not be delivering at a hospital, nor using infant formula for a baby that God gave them! In my opinion, society's stigma has tainted such a beautiful message."
3,Good - but not what I thought,"The book is good, but it's not what I thought. It's a little awkward on a few pages. I wish I knew the entire content of the book because parts of the story don't really apply to me. I probably won't recommend this book to another friend."
3,book review,"beautiful book, I regret however, I did not look inside, or review the book before purchase. Book meant as a gift for my niece. This is my sister's child, and she is a single parent. It is a beautiful book, to give for a child with both mother and father in the house."
3,Mostly good- way too long though,"The book is cute but goes on and on... and on. Don't expect that an average one, two, or even three year old would sit through this entire book as the story drags out. It would be a 5 star book if it excluded the unnecessary messages of hospital birth and bottle feeding and stuck to a length appropriate for children. This is one of those books that you could buy for a baby shower gift for that person at work who you aren't really sure what else to get them and they've put bottles on their registry and you know they attend church on Sundays."
1,DO NOT get for Adopted Child,"(Written by Michael's Wife, Jessica) - I purchased this book as a baby shower present for my sister-in-law and new baby niece. Thank goodness I decided to read through it before wrapping it. This book talks about being pregnant and giving birth. It is wholly inappropriate for adoptive parents/children. I had just had my daughter a few months earlier, so I thought that I could keep it for her. Unfortunately, the book really didn't even apply to us because she was a NICU baby. I really was disappointed that the book had a very limited scope of readership.I'll admit that I may just be disenchanted about this book because I had very high hopes for it."
3,it was a very good book,"This is a very sweet book, but it wasn't my favorite. I guess I wasn't ready to talk about where babies come from yet, and this book mentions that the baby was in the mother's tummy. I know kids know a lot at an early age, but I just wasn't ready to explain why the mother's tummy was big. I think my daughter was incredulous that babies grow in 'tummies.'"
4,great gift book,"Great gift book. Sometimes I tire of books that simply anthropomorphize animals in order to get across a human moral lesson, but this one is quite nice. It is lovely for its simplicity, and lovely for its warmth. Your children will enjoy reading it, and probably enjoy you reading it to them even more."
4,Look inside the wall without gutting it,"Very useful in remodelling work for assessing exisiting plumbing/HVAC work, framing and finding that fish tape that you just can't seem to maneuver correctly. My only complaint is that the light could be brighter. Sure it is a ""nich"" tool - but it is priceless when it solves a major headache with minor damage to walls."
5,A hands-on evaluation.,"We have used the Pro Vision SLIPV100 several times in our Condo complex to locate incorrect sewer line connections before they start leaking. This will save us many dollars in repair and mold cleanup in the future. The Unit is well designed, easy to operate, and gives a clear picture of impending problems."
2,Corset piece falls off shoulders!,I bought this item for Halloween for its corset looking top. However when I tried it on it did not look anything like the girl in the picture and the shoulder straps kept falling off. Bottom line I could not wear it! DO not recommend unless you have very broad shoulders!
1,A big disappointment,"I had high hopes for this video. When I watched it I was extremely disappointed. Sometimes the title gives it away and this time it does.This DVD included just four drills and all of them are, you guessed it, playing 4v4. Playing 4v4 on a narrow field, on a small field, with no goal, with big goal. It failed to even discuss the overall concept of dutch soccer.They also gave coaching points for techniques such as how to pass a ball and shoot a ball. Basically things taught to really young children.I expected much more. Instead of this video save your money and watch some free videos on Dutch soccer on youtube. I got a lot more infomation there and it was free."
3,Great tape,I love the tape....it's just so expensive. I give the product 5 stars but it loses two because the price is very cost prohibitive.
5,Completely Unique Fragrance,"I've been purchasing Elixir of Love creams and perfumes for quite a few years now and the quality of the products are excellent. This hand cream is really a luxury and has quite a few unique ingredients like grape extract, arnica, horsechestnut extract, Ivy extract and silk powder. The fragrance of this cream is extremely beautiful and is made from jasmine, lavender, Egyptian musk and passionflower essential oils. The scent is completely unique and the formula to make this cream was discovered in the archives of Caswell-Massey. This is a rich cream but it not greasy and absorbs fast. If you enjoy this cream you will love the body lotion too.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Strong,"Alright, how many of you were singing the words to Sweet Child O' Mine by G&R upon hearing the intro to ""Words"" for the first time? Exact same chord progression and base line. It's uncanny.This entertaining similarity notwithstanding, The Last Broadcast is a definitely a worthwhile purchase. Check them out live this summer too, if you have the chance."
5,Ours!!,"well. what a band. theyre great, and their second album picks right up from where they left off, and i bet the 3rd will be just as great. great range of songs, some slow, some loud, fast and pumping. and the best thing? theyre BRITISH. and its great, british music. u cant knock it. and no prizes for where i live. we kick the provabial american 'butt' with some of our bands such as the doves, coldplay and radiohead. u love them, and in return u give us some of your great bands. and who said trade wasnt fair. and the 3rd album is already out over here, so haha;-)"
5,WOW. Truly amazing..,"It's 6:51 and I have to leave my house at 7:00 to go to school, and I have yet to get ready. This album is SO good I'm willing to be ate for school JUST to write this review. I woke up to the CD playing on my stereo this morning...and it truly is something to behold. ""Pounding"" had me dancing in the shower!! AND I NEVER DANCE!!! Seriously...I highly highly reccommend..please, if there is one CD you buy today, buy this, there's not a flawless track on it and believe me, you will not regret it. I'm still awestruck, and late for school! BUY THIS CD!!!"
1,disappointing,"This album is a total disappointment. I had thought of Doves as everything Coldplay could be but wasn't. Unfortunately, this album is nothing more than Coldplay all over again. Just weak, uninspiring, pop music, mass produced and made for radio. It has no appeal. It's the kind of music you'll hear in the background in a department store, the kind of music that couldn't possibly offend anyone or make them think. While some fans see this as good song writing or good instrumentality, I don't agree at all that going for mass appeal is a step in the right direction.Thankfully, the third album, Some Cities, brought back the mood of Lost Souls. I have not yet listened to Lost Sides, as I have yet to get the taste of Last Broadcast out of my mouth."
1,Simply dull,"Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this!"
1,not original,"they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't."
5,Hopefully not the last broadcast,"The Doves last release was ambitious and at some points the scope was too broad. Even so ""Lost Souls"" was a very worthy release. With the Last Broadcast the Doves have created an album that is sure to be on everyone's top ten lists this year. ""There goes the fear,"" ""Pounding,"" and ""Words"" are great songs. The density of the sounds created the band is amazing at times.For anyone that liked the previous effort, be sure to pick this record up. It builds on the last offering and has its own place as well. Hopefully this album will do well here in the States, but I'm not complaining. Good music is out there for those who are willing to look."
4,"Very good, but not as much as their debut","As much as their debut album was one of those rare jewels with practically no weak songs, this work by the Manchester band was not as solid all through it. However, it must be said it has several brilliant moments that make you think that their outstanding debut was beyond beginner's luck.The album's three best moments are, literally, at the beginning (following the intro, with ""Words"" their more Coldplay-like track), midway through the album (with the beautiful ""Satellites"", followed by the tripping ""Friday's Dust"") and wrapping it all up, with ""Caught by the river"". Looking forward to their upcoming album, which they are recording at the time of this writing. For now, I leave them with four stars and recommend their ""Lost Souls"" and its counterpart B-sides album ""Lost Sides"" before this one."
5,Masterpiece,"I have a few thousand MP3's on my computer from all my favorite bands. I am extremely picky about the music I listen to...I don't really like anything that I have ever heard on the radio, I have to search around to find music that I truly like...and that composes my list of MP3s. Well, after all that, I stopped listening to all of it after I heard this CD because it's just about all I ever want to hear...that about says it. Best CD ever, even better than their first album (I love the first album but it's a lot more ""ambient"" music and it's less refined and less going on)"
4,a compelling journey,"This album is lush, melodic, poignant and cohesive. This was my first introduction to the Doves and I will immediately be procuring their previous album. I listen to it almost daily; each song is unique and interesting in its own right. I recommend it."
3,incredible disappointment,"for lack of a better way to describe this i will tell all doves fans my initial response after listening to the cd, it ... it cannot even compare to the genius of their first cd, but i would definitely give it a listen. i have to admit that it does grow on you after awhile(keyword-awhile). i think that they spent too much time making stickers, advertising free trips to london, and trying to get a single going to focus on the music, that sadly falls short of all expectations i had."
3,Good but not a masterpiece...,I can't figure all the hoopla over this sophmore albume. I've listened to it over 5 times now and I'll admit it's good with a few VERY spectacular songs but it's not a masterpiece. Anyhow maybe later I'll change my mind and change my review.
5,Wonderful Stuff,"One of the biggest criticisms I tend to hear about this album from people who are familier with the band is that it's so much ""happier"" than the first- haha they made it big and got money and now write happy songs haha.Lord save me from cynics and whiners! The bottom line is that this album is just as stunningly good as ""Lost Souls"" was. Doves simply know how to make ridiculously great music. This is music you feel on a much deeper level than the vast majority of music out there these days."
2,Too bad,"I agree with Paul Scofield, whoever he is. This doesn't measure up to their first album and that's a shame. The songwriting is inconsistent, the tunes are hard to distinguish from each other, and there are WAY too many technical tricks played with the vocals, and some of the synth noises reek of Emerson Lake and Palmer. Egad. Lyrics-wise, nothing comes close to being as heart-rending as, say, ""Valley"" from their 1st record. Did Doves make it too big too quickly? Guys...get depressed all over again!"
4,The Doves do it good,"I was in a record shop buying a Coldplay CD recently and the clerk said if I was into Coldplay I should check out The Doves so I bought this CD. After a few listens, I've come to really like it, although I can't say it's as good as Coldplay. In terms of style, I would say the two bands are cut from the same cloth but I have to give Coldplay the edge when it comes to songwriting and vocals. Nevertheless, this is a fine record in it's own right and certainly worth buying. I'm curious to see how The Doves evolve, because they seem to me a band on the verge of something truly great."
4,The Sound of Lightning Striking Twice,"The Doves follow up to their 2000 release, Lost Souls is more eclectic and varied yet still as strong and satisfying. Of all the great new bands coming from the U.K., the Doves are by far one of the strongest. With just enough hints of dreamy distortion, lush orchestration and catchy hooks, this is an album that is just exceptionally crafted. Even when a couple of the tracks are a bit far reaching, you can't help but give them an ""A"" for effort."
5,coming in clear,"This disc has been in constant rotation since it came out. Every time I listen to it, I discover something new. Great period."
3,An okay album with a few riveting songs!,"First off the tracks 'Words','NY', 'Pounding', and the first single 'Caught by the River' are the only good songs on this album really. The rest is some type of experimental and epiphonic material that doesn't [measure] up to the good rhythyms that this band is known for putting together. This album is decent and hopefully they come out with a fantastic album because it seems that there music writing does get a little better from time to time."
3,Lightning Seeds?? Royalties?,It must be mentioned that the main riff from Words is exactly the same as All I want by the Lightning seeds. We're talking vanilla ice territory here. Lightning Seeds did it better...
5,Doves best,"I was introduced to Doves with this album so maybe I'm biased, but this is not only Doves best album (as of June 2008) but also one of the best albums of the early 2000s. A mix of Pink Floyd and Coldplay is the best way I describe it to friends. Just great music."
4,Great effort,"I was all set to name the influences that I heard on this album then I see that the Amazon.com review lists them: Ride, New Order, etc. Seeing this band live on this tour drove home their Manchurian background. The mix of dancier tracks with sweeping anthemic songs is a great addition to their introspective debut Lost Souls.Check out the nods to David Sylvian on the intro track and the new agey instrumental tidbits.Favorite songs include the more upbeat: Words, There Goes the Fear, N.Y., Pounding.A great album destined to share the heights with the likes of Radiohead, U2, New Order."
4,Break out the headphones...,"The first thing that hit me when I heard this album is these guys really know their way around the studio. After listening for awhile you can hear a little Radiohead, U2, Pink Floyd, Beatles, Alan Parsons, 10cc, Jeff Lynne, Coldplay, etc. influence. You hear glimpses of these people, but they're not imitating them..they make it their own.Every time I listen to this album I hear something I missed the time before. Some of the standout tracks 'The Sulpher Man', 'Pounding', 'Satellites', 'There Goes Fear', & 'Caught By The River'.Sidenote: Don't be caught off guard by the first singing you hear on the album, it's not the main singer..."
4,GREAT FUTURE,"GOOD EFFORT FOR A SECOND ALBUM. GREAT SPACE ROCK ALBUM.N.Y THE GREAT INSTRUMENTAL IN THE MIDDLE IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE HEARD IN A WHILE.THEY OUR NOT AS GREAT AS RADIOHEAD. STARFLYER 59,OR THE SPIRITUALIZED. BUT THEY HAVE GOTTEN BETTER."
1,A very poorly produced book!,"This is arguably the most sloppily produced book I ever read:The number of misspelled Yiddish words is enormous; the most frequenly recurring one is zid in place of zikh, or stub for shtub, cheyli for kheylik (or cheylik), toches-lecher for toches-lecker, etc. The gender of words is often wrong (di for der or vice versa).The etymology of words is often inaccurate. The most blatant example:Bobe-mayse is not derived from a story your grandmother told you, and you are free to use the word in her presence. It comes from a 16-th century translation into Yiddish by Elja Levita of the Italian romance ""Bovo d'Antona"" published under the name of ""Bobe-bukh"".I am tempted to send the book back to Amazon for a $ 10 refund, even if I have to pay for return shipmen!"
4,"Accurate cover baloons--a little scary regarding ""curses""","I should have considered that the cover indicates ""curses"". There are plenty of mean-spirited curses, which frankly scared me; these are clearly idiomatic within Yiddish language, but were not what I expected. I should have purchased a Yiddish dictionary or thesaurus for my interest level. The book contains much more, and the curse section (i.e., a hex or spell vs. calling people nasty names when they take your parking spot) is not primary, and there are plenty of OTHER areas of the book which are FUN and INTERESTING. It's a personal choice, obviously, so a potential reader shouldn't disregard the book based on MY superstitious nature alone! I guess I just wanted to understand the terms I've heard TO SWEAR for my own venting agenda."
3,A good lens for the price.,"I've had this lens for a few years using it on my Canon Eos system. Overall I've been fairly happy with it. The quality of the glass is good, and at F/5.6 through out the range it's fairly fast.On the down side it is very heavy and almost always requires a tripod mount.It comes with a built in tripod ring that allows you to rotate the lens and body on the tripod. This is a very useful feature and no large lens should be without.Over all I recommend this lens for those with a limited budget looking for a longer lens."
1,Complete waste of time,"YAWN!!!!! And, I understand that there are about 3000 sequels to this one. Pass it by"
5,best author,"Love this book it is awesome I cant wait to see what Harry is going to do next. when you think the end is near there is a turn and you are going in another direction. Keeps you reading. very different kind of vampire but why would I want to read about the same thing all of the time. Read it and fall in love with Harry and everyone else best to start at the beginning so you understand the story and what is happening, Necroscope 1st"
3,"A must-read, but not because it is particularly good","I am a devoted reader of Brian Lumley's works, but I found this book to be difficult to read. The plot is fairly obvious from the start and fails to develop very much until very close to the end, when it picks up the pace and more closely resembles some of Lumley's other books in terms of horror and suspense. I found myself forcing myself to read it, as if it were a chore, simply because I found all the Necroscope books before it to be fantastic and wanted to move on to the next volume in the Necroscope series. Of all the Necroscope books written to date, I found this one to be the weakest link in the series. Despite its slow plot developments, however, I recommend reading this book, if only to better understand the underlying plot of Deadspawn, which is a fantastic book. If you find this work to be a bit of a disappointment, you are not alone, but you'll be glad you read it once you begin the book that follows."
4,"""The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward""","Great story. Hum....come to think of it, I've read this somewhere else before? Oh yeah, it's the exact same premise as H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward"" from 1941. If Lovecraft was still around he might even hire a copyright lawyer for this one. I strongly recommend anyone who has read this book to seek out Lovecraft's story; I even ""more"" strongly recommend reading Lovecraft first.Anyway, despite the fact Lumley converted Lovecraft's tale into one of his ""Necroscope"" novels, I'll forgive him for the unoriginal idea, because this maybe one of the best books of the series. The read is easy and very fast paced. Character development as always is excellent. There is ""plenty o' mean & evil"" throughout.Definitely read the Lovecraft story though...."
4,Nonstop Read,"Main thing I need to say is that I got the first book to kill time on a road trip. That was 2 weeks and 4 books ago.Brian Lumley is replacing Ann Rice view on the Vampire for me and my friends! Read this series, a true must read!!Necroscope"
4,Modern Othello,"When I first found out that the book Othello was originally a Shakespeare play, I immediately thought 'I don't want to read some Elizabethan garbage...' but after enduring the first few boring chapters I came to notice that the book was actually a modern of version of Othello, with also an extremely interesting plot. Some of the original lines from Shakespeare appeared in the book, and instead of loathing the complex language I came to appreciate the intricacy that Shakespeare had put into the words. Altogether, I thought Othello was a great entertaing read."
5,Blue Jeans,Anything with Gene Harris in the group is teriffic ! A Must add to the serious jazz lover's collection .
4,"It fits, it works...",...not sure what else I can say about it. Now I'm filling in the 11 word minimum so I can get out.
4,Modern Art,"An excellent collection of Foxx's most well-known songs, from the early Numanesque days of ""Underpass"" and ""Burning Car"" right through to ""Nightlife"" - an invigorating slice of minimal but effective, kraftwerkish techno that signals the forthcoming release ""The Pleasures of Electricity"". a very promising preview indeed. In between you'll find lots of single edits and rare b-sides including the original version of ""Endlessly"". Essential for fans and a great starting point for the casual listener."
3,These picks aren't for me,I've recently purchased and played with these picks and I did not have the same experience as those who gave higher reviews. I found these picks to be very slick and hard to grasp when playing fast and when my fingers start to sweat. There is a notch on the top of each of the picks and it seems like this is where the mold was injected and the pick was removed. I've never seen a notch like this on any other pick and it does scratch my hand at times when I'm playing. I'll continue to use Jim Dunlop nylon picks but these gel picks don't work for me.
5,Best Invention!,"I cant use any other pick now...Im hooked.did not imagine this could make that big of a differencebut comfort and functionality i cant use any of the old picks i ownthis is the one and only now and forever,."
5,Keson the cavers choice for surveying!,"This product is used by many cavers as the number one measing tool for underground survey of caves. We have taken these tapes well over 500ft underground and have draged them thru some of the worst mud, grit, and grind you can imagine. We have gone to the point of completely covering the tape with mud. So much mud you can not even see the numbers and just washed the tape in water and its like new again. No where above ground are you ever going to incounter conditions like what we put these tapes thru. You get what you pay for and Keson Tapes are just that indestructable!"
1,Claiar Burke Applejack and Peel Home Fragrance Oil,I would not purchase this oil agin. It has very little fragrance even when using it with my lamp oil container which is designed for just that purpose
1,Terrible! A waste of time and money!,"Along with Volume 1, I found A Taste of Salsa-Volume II a waste of my time and money. I purchased both of these videos together based on the praises in another persons review. I have learned my lesson! I'm assuming these 2 ""instructors"" rated the videos themselves. I found them far from impressive. For the price you pay you learn very few moves. They spend more time on long, drawn out explanations than anything else. I would not recommend buying this video. If you must, my copies are for sale 2nd hand!"
2,for bilingual people these videos get boring fast,I feel this video has the same faults as their first video it is for intermediate beginners. It only teaches a couple of moves. Each move is taught in English then is repeated almost word for word in Spanish. After you watch them teach a simple move over & over in one language you do not want to watch the moves repeated over & over in other language. It soon got very boring. I do not think much of the skill of the teachers either. There are better Salsa instructional videos being sold on Amazon. The only good point in this video is that it teaches all the moves in Spanish as well as English.
4,Great basics,"If you are a novice and looking to learn in a correct and structured way, these videos (Vol I & II) are very sound and easy to understand. The videos are introductory, so if you already know the basics, perhaps they are not for you. Don't pay attention to the criticism of those who weren't smart enough to read the description and look for more information about the videos from the internet or the instructors' website. The videos are clearly labeled basic. That's why they are titled ""A Taste of....""I gave it four stars because even though the intent to make the tapes universal by making them bilingual is good, it does tend to slow the lessons a bit. Why not use subtitles for the alternate language?"
5,Amazing for my speech delayed son!,"I purchased this video on a whim and it is my 2-year old son's absolute favorite. He is speech delayed and receives intensive in-home therapy. Through therapy, and use of this video, he is now counting, identifying letters, colors, numbers, animal noises, etc. A wonderful educational tool that takes the guilt out of television watching. A must have for all toddlers. And, yes, the music is really good. My husband and I both enjoy it."
2,Not the best,"We have purchased most of the Angelina Ballerina series as my daughter loves the books, but this one was really terrible. We loved Angelina's Birthday, but it now seems like many of these stories are thin in plot at best. This story was just plain stupid and after I'd read it to my daughter once, she hasn't asked to hear it again. To me, that's the true test of the quality of a book - the best ones never get old. Skip this one!"
2,Part of Intro came out immediately,"Part of the Introduction came out immediately as if it were never attached. This shouldn't happen on a ""Like New"" book. I enjoy the book but the condition is wholly unacceptable. No other pages have fallen out, however."
2,Not For Professional,Even I do not expect this will be a perfect tool at [money]. The lazer is never still when we try to find out the length from wall to wall. Sometimes it works properly but sometimes the length is wrong or it says Error. It is handy when it works properly but not when it is not working properly.All I can say is that sometimes it's useful and sometimes it's not. Thank you for understanding this.
1,Accuracy?,"This is really a pretty useless tool. The accuracy is quoted at +/-.5% within 50 feet. .5% of 50 feet is 3"". This would be unacceptable for any measurement I can imagine bothering to do. I think I will stick with my 50' tape measure."
2,Correction to Dale Howell,"3 inches compared to 50 feet is not 3 percent, it's 1/2 of 1 percent, just like the manufacturer review states.This is an OK product for measuring finished but unfurnished rooms. I find it difficult or unusable for either construction or furnished-room measurements."
1,Questionable value for flooring sales,"The number of reviews that think this product is acceptable for flooring measurements surprises me. It may have value for rough estimates, but as a professional in residential flooring sales, with 14 years experience with the leading retailer in central Ohio, I think that a 3"" tolerance in 50' is unacceptable. I certainly don't want to risk being 3% short on a job, nor do I want to be charging my customers for 3% extra material and labor just because I can't trust my measuring device.In my opinion, unless this device's accuracy can be improved, it should only be used for noncritical estimates. Measurements for a firm quote, or for installation purposes, would then need to be redone with a tape measure."
4,accurate description,"I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSBAND TO DISPLAY HIS MANY WATCHES. I SAW ONE SIMILAR AT FORTUNOFF'S BUT IT HELD ONLY 12 FOR THE SAME PRICE. THE FINISH IS BEAUTIFUL. IT HAS SPACE FOR AN ENGRAVED PLATE. ONLY ONE DRAW BACK, LARGER WATCHES DO NOT FIT WELL IN THE DRAWER."
5,Great buy,"This product turned out to be exactly what I wanted. It was perfect for the amount of watches that my husband had. He has room to expand his collection and uses the drawer for other items. (The cushions are removable) He has different items (rings, chains, tie clips, etc...) in each section. It looks nice on our dresser. I would recommend it. A good buy. My husband loved it."
4,damage,"the box is very nice. However it arrived with a chip broken off the bottom left corner. Due to the color of the veneer and the underlying material, the damage is very noticeable."
3,the 2 story watch box,"The storage box looks, feels, and even smells great. the see through pane on the top even makes it look really expensive, and it really does its job. Down side is that it does its job on the top deck, the bottom part of the storage unit is very thin, large watches wont fit in the bottom drawer. if u have 10 big/ wide watches and some thin ones, you'll be fine."
2,Bad finishing,"The services and delivery process through Amazon online was very good and arrived in quick time. However same cannot be said for the 20 - watches burlwood box. It's a pity though the box was well constructed but the surface finishing was slipshod with unevenly applied clear lacquer on the box top. Although it's not too expensive one would have appreciated better QC control before delivery by vendor. Too much of a hassle returning and asking for a replacement or refund, will avoid ordering from vendor in future."
4,NOFX,"NOFX was a punk band that have been playing together since the early 80s and i have to say have changed a hell of alot since then mostly,i think, because El Hefe entered the band. anyways to the review most of these songs werent on there other records, but are different versions of the ones on the record. the first disc is kick ass, the new song Pimps and Hoookers is great. Then the Misfits cover of Last Caress recorded for the Misfits tribute album is on here witch is excellent. and for the most part the whole first disc is really good. the second disc is a different story there all songs of them just f*cking up,the average song is like 45 seconds. i think there funny but they could of done with it hence the 4 star rating. but overall this is worth the 17 dollars."
4,Not to bad...,"Well I bought this CD the first CD is really good and worth the purchase in itself... but the second cd isnt so great in my opinion. Its got some ok songs , but I think these were the worst of the worst.. seems like they just wanted to make a double album.. but hey it was only 12$ for two cd's any NOFX fan will enjoy this album its a must get."
4,Cheap bunch of quality NOFX outtakes,"Despite a few annoying songs that you will always be skipping past, the majority of the songs on the 1-CD priced 2-CD set are great. The highlights of this album include the only unreleased song, Pimps and Hookers, a cover called Electricity, and the great 2000 single Pods and Gods, as well as the Surfer EP, which is about as long as the first part of The Decline. This is an all around great album for any NOFX fans who are ready to hear their new sound along with a lot of cool stuff from before that you haven't got around to listening to yet."
4,Saw It Comin'!,"This is an awesome CD. The songs are as good as the ones in the other records so don't think they suck! The Only Bad thing is that the songs on disc 2 are quite short but still good.This CD has loads of songs from almost 20 years ago and the freshly made Pimps & Hookers. This CD is good for all types of fans. For long time ones to finish their collection, to big hardcore fans it?s a must have and to new fans it will bring a great idea of how the band was at the beginning, middle and now.My personal favourite is Pimps and Hookers but it has some dumb songs like Electricity. I think that this CD would be 5 stars if it would have longer songs and some live appearinces."
3,Not bad,"I'm not much of a NOFX fan, but i heard this cd and its pretty good. Tons and tons of rare songs and B sides. NOFX certantly records more tracks than any other band. If your a fan of NOFX, get this."
2,Tempering the positives...,"I wanted to write my own review to temper the glowing and perhaps overly positive reviews preceding mine which led me to buy this book. The book is good, yes, but only if you have little-to-no exposure to other, similar literature dealing with adult children of alcoholics or the roots of codependency (for example). The exercises in the book are useful if you've never kept a journal or practiced another form of self-awareness discovery. Otherwise, you may find them boring and obvious."
4,Le Chanbom,"I enjoyed this film very much it is a heart rending movie about the Jewish children in a small French town, I believe in the French/Swiss frontier. It is well acted by unknown actors but very well directed. I highly recomend it."
4,"On a par with the Aero Series Classic, but more recent","Schiffer Books won't rest till they publish every standard out-of-print reference in English from other publishers either again or they set their translators to work on standard references in other languages. So now we have a German book, probabely published some years earlier than 1992. If you own one one the more recent books about the Me262 there is a chance that you develop a strong deja-vu feeling looking through this one. On the other hand, if you already own several of the classics about the Me262, you get the same feeling reading one of those 300+ pages blockbuster about this plane as well.My advise: there are worse things you can buy about second world war aviation than the Schiffer Military History series, and having a complete set of schiffer books is quite a collection to have. Compared to the brand-new reference bibles about the Me262 it is quite affordable too."
5,One Of My Favorite Deep Conditioners,"Fantasia Inter Cellular is an excellent haircare brand. I find their products are extremely effective in treating natural hair. Specifically, this reconstructor, that I utilize as a conditioner, lubricates your hair and provides an intense boost of aloe vera, biotin, panthenol, and protein as well as organic haircare treatments like horsetail, birch leaf, sage, nettle, and clover just to list a few. I use this product whenever I wash my hair, and it leaves my hair more manageable.Also, I recommend these following products from Fantasia Inter Cellular:Fantasia Ic Hair Strengthener Treatment Repairs BreakageFantasia IC Herbal/Vitamin Braid Sheen Spray, 12 ozFantasia Leave in Treatment Moist Aloe Complex 12 oz."
2,Find Something Better,"Zelazny creates some powerful imagery in this novel but not much else. Like many fantasy writers he paints fantastic scenery and invokes images both powerfully sublime and frightfully horrible. Yet the characters are flat, the dialogue is tedious, the story is slow, and there is no real cohesion to the mythic structure of the story. What Zelazny turns out is a generic fantasy story that never reaches deep enough into the human heart to resonate with those who don't exclusively enjoy fantasy. He also uses a strange sort of 1970's style detective lingo when writing dialogue which seems completely out of place in this story. Also, as is unfortunately common in fantasy, some disturbing misogynistic undertones churn throughout this story. I give it a D+."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"After Corwin escapes, he decides to try something new in his struggle with Eric. Firepower. Having spent time on Earth, he goes travelling to build up a force equipped with a large number of guns.With his force, he returns to Amber and makes an assault to try and unseat his brother and take over."
4,Battle for Hue: Tet 1968,"An excellent book. Perhaps the only improvement would be the addition of more detailed maps so that the reader is able to follow the events as they arise. As a Marine veteran, I seldom read anything concerning the Vietnam war because most of the books are not very factual. However, this book is well written and reveals a great deal of research. There is NO fiction here. Nolan once again demonstrates his outstanding literary talents. I agree, I dont understand how Hollywood has let this slip away."
5,A GRIPPING TESTIMONY OF THE FIGHT FOR HUE CITY,"THE AUTHOR, KEITH WILLIAM NOLAN, DUMPS THE BATTLE FOR HUE CITY IN YOUR LAP. A COMPLELLING ACCOUNT OF THE U.S. MARINES FIGHT FOR THE IMPERIAL CITY OF SOUTH VIETNAM IN 1968. NOLAN DOES A FANTASTIC JOB IN PROVIDING JUST ENOUGH FOREGROUND SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FIGHT. SUPERBLY WRITTEN THROUGH THE EYES OF NUMEROUS VETERANS THIS BOOK LEAVES YOU DASHING ACROSS STREETS AND SLAMMING INTO COURTYARD WALLS.THIS IS NOT DIALOGUE AS PRESENTED BY VETERAN'S. RATHER IT IS A MASTERPIECE IN WHICH HE TELLS THE STORY OF THE BATTLE FOR HUE CITY USING THESE VETERANS IN CHARACTER.THIS BOOK IS EASY ON THE EMOTIONS, LEAVES YOU WITH A VERY GRAPHIC SENSE OF THE BATTLE, AND AN AMAZINGLY LIGHT READ.SEMPER FIDELIS!"
5,Nolan Matches His Best Works Again,"The latest read I've experienced from Keith Nolan, Tet 1968 gave me an understanding I never got from text books or movies. I felt that I was there, and understood how the grunts felt. I have read most of Nolan's other works and find this to be a deserving addition. My next is Into Laos/Lam Son 719, which I was finally able to track down after four years. I expect more of the same realism, unwavering accuracy, and action filled narrative that I did in Tet 1968."
5,Brilliance of an Orchester o Sound,"Having listened to this piece find it the most magnificent of melodrama, song without words, that stirs even the deepest soul without a beat in it to feel a deep need to and exilerating need to drum and move with it. Not a collection of sounds but a dynamic dream that feels every part of the human body and soul"
1,No Quality Control,On the first attempt to use it two things broke at the tip that is supposed to attach to the tire valve: 1) the plastic pivot axle and 2) the plastic housing that holds the pivot axle.I would not trust these and did not order a replacement.
1,Presta vavle does not work,Our bikes have the presta valve. We received this pump and it did not work with this valve. No airflow through that area.
1,Does not work,This product simply does not create a tight enough seal to pump air into the tires adequately and it also does not contain an accurate air pressure gauge. This is very disappointing from a well known company in the cyclist world.
1,Look elsewhere,"Like many others, I could not get this to work with a Presta valve.My old (lost) blackburn is fine. This thing seems to be designed very poorly."
1,worthless....,"lasted for only 3 tires before blowing a seal at the base of the pump.cheap, cheap, cheap......"
1,Bell Airstrike 2100,"This product has changed and is not the same as shown online. I called Bell and they confirmed the product is now a much less product than shown.The hose is too short. It does not reach a car tire valve unless the valve is on the bottom. The tire pressure gage is not accurate (I received 3 of these pumps - and sent them all back), off by as much as 20 psi. The pump sent was rated at 120 psi, not 160. It did not have a dual head as shown and described online.In short, it is about the same as the $7 pumps one can get in a local store, not very good"
4,good product,"I've used this to fill my bike's tires and my f-150's tires (took quite awhile). works great. Construction is not as tough as some I've seen so I've knocked one star off for that, but at the price it is worth it."
2,very very cheap,"this is no gold mine. sure it costs very little.. but its mostly junk.if you're filling up a child's bike tire to 40-60 psi a few times a year, fine, i guess it'll work.anything over 80 psi is nearly impossible as the handle begins to bend significantly..hose is short.guage is inaccurate.seriously, only buy this if you're perfectly fine with a VERY low quality pump."
4,"Top book, top guy",I had the pleasure of a 2 day course given by the author back in 2000. The 3D graphical representations of the various functions are very clear. (Peter wrote his own software to generate display and produce suitable output for book printing.)
4,Great basic field guide for Baja!,"I agree with the review of Steven Mlodinow. The book introduction covers the following in a very basic way: Geography, Geology and Diversity in Baja California, Finding Reptiles and Amphibians, Venomous Reptiles, Conservation, Organization & how to use this guide. There is also a section called ""Spanish names for amphibians and reptiles"" followed by a brief glossary. Then follows the mainsection of the book ""Classification and Species Accounts"". There is also a ""Selected References"" section as well as a nice table of the amphibians and reptiles of Baja California, Mexico which is a taxonomic listing that also includes common names. I found this guide useful during my 2 excursions in Baja to quickly identify the amphibians and reptiles I came across."
5,A great beginning to get you hooked on Salsa,"Directed specifically to the absolute beginner. Not only for the beginner in Salsa but in dancing as a whole. Their approach is very methodical, relaxed and fun. ""dancing is about having fun"" they say consistently. After their first video, Salsa becomes less intimidating, very much a do able thing, and you can defend yourself on the floor. This video is a great starting point in going up the Salsa ladder and becoming a ""Salsero/a""."
2,for bilingual people these videos get boring fast,This video is for absolute beginners. It only teaches a couple of moves. Each move is taught in English then is repeated almost word for word in Spanish. After you watch them teach a simple move over & over in one language you do not want to watch the moves repeated over & over in other language. It soon got very boring. I do not think much of the skill of the teachers either. There are better Salsa instructional videos being sold on Amazon. The only good point in this video is that it teaches all the moves in Spanish as well as English.
1,Save your money!,This has got to be one of the worst Salsa instructional videos I have purchased to date. For the price you get very little. It is repetative and annoying. You only learn 3 steps. I would definately not recommend this video to a beginner.
2,"nice trinket but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,","not realy worth the price ,its hard to read and i believe a manual protractor would do just as well , im not impressed with this toolanyone want to buy it???"
5,Reviews and discriptions are misleading,"However the people at Amazon were great and so fast to send us a new one when the one we recieved didn't work. Well, the second one seemed a little quirky as well but an e-mail or two from the nice people at Bosch cleared things right up. It will come in handy when my husband is building a playhouse and swingset for the kids. And for zeroing his saw."
1,Don't bother with this tool !!,"This miter finder cannot find the simple miter for a 96 degree or even a 90 degree angle. Nor is it useful in the installation of crown moulding. The Bosch reps don't even know how to use their own product. We contacted several (3) all with different info NONE of which was accurate. It will find angles, but a protractor for less than a dollar will do that. We were also told ours did not work, so we bought a second one. Well it worked like the first!! Save your money."
5,Worth learning how to use it,"I bought this over a year ago to help with a house I'm building. I started doing the kitchen and couldn't remember the directions so I did part of the kitchen, a inside and outside corner without it. I was all trial and error and I wasted alot of wood.I decided to sit down and learn how to use this tool and it was worth it.I finished the rest of a large kitchen with a few crazy angles in one day and it came out great.I just wished I learned how to use it properly sooner."
1,Had problems with Bosch protractor,"I got the Bosch Digital protractor for a gift that I requested. Upon opening, and installing the batteries, I found that when I tried to calculate any spring angles or any angle at that point, the protractor only displayed four dashes, and would not calculate anything. It then went back to the angle the arms were opened to. Not being able to get the unit to do anything but read the angles by the arms, I decided to send it back for a refund. I sent an inquiry to Bosch about probable causes, but failed to receive a response. I do not intend to repurchase another, for fear that I can get another with a button problem."
4,Back to Basics,"This digital protractor takes the guess out of the angles and use of charts for crown molding. It really saves alot of time. However, it does not do the most basic calculation - miter degree for flat molding to the wall at a corner. I still need my Starrett or back to a chart or calculator."
4,"Great Item Very Accurate, but look at the new kit from Bosch","I have always been happy with Amazon, but will still check for prices and features on other sites. This item now comes as a 3 piece kit(tool,case & extension leg) from Bosch. The last two items are only offered as accessories here. The kit is available elsewhere for $126.50 delivered. Only want the tool, get it here. $16.50 more will get you everything elsewhere. The tool itself is very accurate and I have used it to align all my wood working tools. The price isn't really much more than the price of a Sterling combo square and it does lots more. Tool itself seems very sturdy and the case provides extra protection."
3,Lacking,"Bosch tools are made - mechanically and structurally - well and the angle finder is no exception. However, its utility is lacking. It is large and bulky. If you have a bulkhead or soffit that has a depth less than the length of one of the arms of the angle finder then you can't determine an angle with it. The one arm surface will rest on the soffit surface (with its end cap butted to the wall) and extend beyond the surface where you would normally swivel the other arm flush. The variable input method is also lacking. It would be great if you could store variables - i.e., spring angle. For someone who does not like to cope or finds the tool useful for tasks other than crown/trim installation then maybe it has its benefits. I would not say this is a workshop must. It's a pretty cool conversation piece in the though."
5,excellent,"This tool does exactly what Bosch said it would. It has become an indespensible part of my toolbox. I use it every day in my custom cabinet shop and my installers use it everyday as well. As to the review that it does not help with crown mouldings, he is most likely misinformed on how to use it. It is invaluable to installing crown mouldings. You did a good job Bosch. A laser would make it that much better."
2,Expensive Toy,"I bought one, used it and returned it. Yeah it is accurate, but do I need to know a right angle is not an exact 90*? Maybe it is 89.4*. And if it is, you cannot set your typical miter saw to cut that minus .4* accurately enough anyway. So your cut will not be exactly the same as the angle the Bosch Miter Finder displays on the screen. Finding the angles or stairway spindles and handrails can be done just as easy with an inexpensive angle finder or a scrap piece of wood, pencil and level. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful tool. But if I would have kept it, it would have sat in my tool box most of the time. If you do enough trim work, you'll rely more on your site and experience rather than a tool that gives you the exact angle of a cut to the fraction or decimal which cannot be achieved on most saws."
5,Crown at odd angles made easy,"I have owned this tool for 3 years using it occasionally for wide crown cut on the flat. I recently had to install 5 inch crown in a 100 year old, 8,000 square foot house with octagon and hexagon ceilings. Using this angle finder to simply identify all the odd angles made the job go so much faster and accurate. The crown was narrow enough to cut on the fence so we devided the angle measurement by 1/2 on all the miters and they fit perfect without cope cutting all the steep angles that require so much stock removal.Regarding the .3 degree inaccuracy post. Can you dial in .3 degrees on your miter saw. .3 degrees is inconsequential."
3,Bosch DWM40L Miter Finder,The product may be good but it needs better instructions. I can not find more instructions anywhere.
2,DEPRESSING AND BORING,"Our church book club selected this; our high hopes have been dashed (aside from one reader who proclaims it the best book we have studied!). Hammarskjold's random musings lack context; where was he in his life exactly? He seems depressed at every turn. We suspect an inability to define his need for love (perhaps homosexual?). We read 30 pages per week, but the topics never change. His self-loathing dominates. An occasional pearl does emerge: ""God does not die on the day when we cease to believe in a personal deity, but we die on the day when our lives cease to be illumined by the steady radiance, renewed daily, of a wonder, the source of which is beyond all reason."" p. 56"
5,Markings,Inspiring for a young person beginning his career. It is possible to dedicate yourself to God's work and still achieve recognition and personal success.
3,Spiritual yet mind-boggling,"I picked up ""Markings"" because I was always intrigued about the United Nations and the role of the secretary-general. The poetic pieces intersperse with diary entries makes for a look into an individual mind devoted to work yet deeply spiritual. It is a constant reminder of the challenge of the self.If you are a history buff, especially post WWII, reading this in combination with a biography of Hammarskjold makes for a mind-boggling read and a reminder that every public servant remains an individual."
5,Deeply moving,"I bought the book after attending the exhibition of paintings ""Moments of Silence""- by Uwe Appold on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the death of Dag Hammarskjold with captions of haiku by Hammarskjold himself. It is indeed quite unusual for a Secretary-General to pen down his emotions and intimate feelings in such a candid and humble way. A struggle with death and things dying. A collection of thoughts, reflections, poems and emotions that affect you deeply and keep you coming back for more. You never really finish reading this book. Deeply moving."
3,A bit disappointing...,"This book is a list of musings and words of ""wisdom"" from the mind of Mr. Hammarskjold. It seemed very impersonal and detached. His words would have had so much more meaning and impact if they were connected with what was going on in the world and his life at the time he put these thoughts on paper!"
4,incredible content,"incredible content...but the cover condition was not as described by the seller, making the price too high."
1,Eek A Mouse???,I'm looking for a Sun Splash Video include Eek A Mouse Ganja Smuggling! Where can i find it? My Adress-Tomskin@web.de
5,"Lint-free, long-lasting towel","I've had two of these towels in regular use for over ten years. Lint-free, they make the ideal towel for glass, crystal, and flatware."
1,one does not equal four,"The one leg that was shipped, I think, worked ok There are other reviews saying the same thing. Was told by amazon that I received what I ordered. If I wanted four then I should have orrdered four. $80.00 for a set of 4 legs???????"
3,Not appropriate for a novice,"This book is an adequate introduction to various guitar techniques and theory, BUT this book will not provide you the necessary background to begin learning to play a guitar from scratch. Specifically, if you don't know guitar terminology, don't know the basic anatomy of a guitar, have never strung your own guitar, don't know the proper way to hold a guitar, and are unsure of basic hand posture (or have any of a number of other fundamental questions that may plague a neophyte), then this book is not the place to start.This book is appropriate for a person who has played for a few months and is seeking to add more depth to their playing repertoire, but for those of us who still don't know our a*ses from our elbows this is not the place to start."
1,limited appeal,"When you found this book, I hope you were not expecting beautiful photos of French Country or Classic styles of interior design. Instead, this book is the equivalent of a bad art house movie. It has out-of-focus pictures of grungy looking rooms taken at unflattering camera angles in bad lighting.If you are someone who likes to polish up ""diamonds in the rough,"" you may like this book. Because I think only people that can look at junk and find some intrinsic value in it will like this book. However, those people will probably like the book titled Big City Junk better."
5,Great reading,"sad, funny, nostalgic and a beautifully moving story, cleverly told from the perspective of a man, who seems pretty straightforward emotionally, yet who is able to evoke emotional complexity that completely pulls you in and wins you over."
5,Magnificent characters!,"I love books that are chock full of rich characters. Books from authors like John Irving, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. This is one of those books! Smithy Ide, his sister Bethany, her uncle Count and others will burn themselves into your memory. It was hard putting this book down and I was disappointed to be through with it. Highly recommended!!!"
3,Well Written but Frustrating,"This guy Smithy Ide is a frustrating character. He just won't assert himself in any manner whatsoever, letting the world push him around. He gets into a whole variety of situations on his spontaneously conceived bike ride across the U.S., but he's always at the mercy of these situations right down to when he arrives at his final destination in Venice CA. I kept wanting this guy to be something I guess, by the way Ron McLarty conceived him, he couldn't be. What I'm saying is he was a character I just couldn't personally relate to, though I could feel sorry for him. He has redeeming qualities, but because he has such low self-esteem, he lets others push him around. Anyway, it's an interesting story and maybe because of its frustrating main character, a memorable one, but I can't say this will be my favorite book."
2,"Blah, blah","I was really looking forward to this and was disappointed. The writing is poor, the plot weak, and the ending pathetic. The only reason that I can see that Stephen King recommended this book is that the author has co-written books with him. I was looking forward to a memorable read and this was not it."
2,Too much whining,"A fat guy sets off to bicycle across the country letting the trip help him come to terms with the impact his mentally ill sister has had on his life while also keeping him rooted in a relationship to the girl next door. McLarty gives us interesting characters in an interesting story, but there is something profoundly annoying about this book. Perhaps the author is bilking the reader for too much sympathy; perhaps it's the scrambled time sequence. I don't recommend it."
4,Fun though predictable,"This is a very enjoyable book about a guy who somehow finds himself in the middle of events by chance, during an unlikely cross-country redemption trip on a bike. The author does a very good job at making you dislike the main character at the beginning, and as the book progressess you learn to accept him, feel compassion for him, and finally root for him. The book plays a lot with the preconceived judgements people make about others just by looks, or circumstances. The story becomes a little predictable after a while, and even though I knew how it was going to end, I wanted to go along for the ride... and it was a fun ride."
3,"Read it, but don't believe the hype.","So much has been made about how this book came to be published (in printed form anyway). An established best-selling author shining a spotlight on a struggling comrade. I don't think anyone could argue that this novel deserved to dwell in the slush piles forever but neither is it the heralded classic some have made it out to be. I read it, it was okay, worthwhile even. Is it as good as Confederacy of Dunces? Is it the next Catcher in the Rye? Well, no. It's more Where the Heart Is than The Odyssey I'd say. I'm not sorry I read it by any means but I don't think it's the 'Must Read' novel of the year either."
1,Unbearable!,"There is no reason anyone would want to spend an extended amount of time with the protagonist. Not likeable, not believable, not relate-able.The episodic structure is an artifice, not something that helps the story. If you like Forrest Gump as your source of history, then you will like this book as your source for interpersonal relationships -- this book is just as unbelievable with asprirations to being a feel good experience."
5,Great Book!,Loved this book! The main character is someone you grow to care about. His story pulls you in. Did not want this book to end. Best book I have read in a long time.
2,unrealistic characters and dialogue,"I, too, was really looking forward to this book. I usually enjoy novels about journeys of self-discovery, and I also enjoy books about travel and interesting characters. In fact, I got as far as page 127 or thereabouts, but I realized at that point that I was wasting my time. The book started off well enough, and I liked the character of Smithy, but the characters he meets along the way are just too bizaare; they simply didn't 'ring true', and the dialogue was poor.A very disappointing selection."
3,"Okay, but not great.","I was so excited to read this book when I read all the hype surrounding it. I'm a huge fan of John Irving's, so when I heard that Memory of Running was about a ""quirky"" character I figured it was on the same calibre of an Irving novel. So, I was disappointed when I started reading Memory and found that the writing is mediocre at best. So many other writers (Toole, Irving, Proulx,Roth) have done the ""loser"" plot much better than McLarty. It's a nice, quick, light read, but I don't feel it's deserving of the 5 star reviews it's been getting."
3,Take A Wild Ride With Smithy Ide,"After losing both parents in a car accident and learning the whereabouts of his missing sister's remains, Smithson Ide sets out on a cross-country bike ride to claim her remains so she can be laid to rest with his parents.On this journey, Mr. Ide is hit by a truck, get shot, and meets a cast of interesting characters with stories of their own. As we accompany Smithy on his trek, we share in his personal growth and realizations of how he is in charge of his own destiny. Smithy learns he has not been alone in his misery for all these years as the people he meets reveal a small part of their personal sufferings.Will you find this book enjoyable? I just don't know."
1,What is all the fuss about this book?,"I'd heard great things...but I don't get it.The story is depressing and predictable from the first page..and I don't feel any connection to the main character at all.There are a lot of good books out there, but this isn't one of them."
3,"Okay, but not great.","I had such high hopes for this book. It had high ratings and I had seen that Stephen King thought it was great, so I figured it must be, right? I just didn't get some things, like why Smithy had an epiphany that bananas were fabulous and ate them for every meal. And I got tired of hearing his obsession of every female's breasts. His conversations with Norma were so odd and choppy. And if he got shot/almost got shot/got beat up one more time, I think I would stopped reading. I get it already - poor Smithy always gets the short end of the stick. Still, the main story was okay and I understood what McLarty was getting at. I am sure a lot of people can relate to Smithy, but it was sort of lukewarm for me. I was disappointed . . . I can see why publishers had rejected McLarty's book for the past 15 years."
2,Mediocre,"To be fair, I haven't finished this novel. It's not as if I have no free time, I do-- I just couldn't stay interested in the characters at all. Chapters here and there are well-written and drew me in, but the overall ""quest"" of the main character is boring and cliched, and there is nothing in the novel to make me like him. Right now I have no real reason to want to finish the book, other than to fill up moments of sheer boredom."
4,I'm traveling but I heard it came in good shape!,"a little slow on the uptake but in excellent shape, thank you!I wanted to take it to TX with me but it arrived when i was here for 12 days. Next time i will pay the extra money, thanks!"
2,Predictable Plot,"This book is so predictable that I had a real hard time finishing it. The story is contrived, boring and repetitive. It does have some very funny and touching moments but they get lost in the more unsiginificant events intertwined in the narrative. It is full of one-dimensional, stereotyped characters. There is nothing new nor refreshing in this book that merits the high praise it has received. We've seen these type of stories in many other books so there is no uniqueness in it."
4,Road Novel Meets Redemption,"The Memory of Running is a solid contemporary American novel. It combines outer and inner journeys with a fabulous finish. I've already read it twice and presented it at a book group. My take is that it's a really good story that offers a good deal for discussion--I definitely wanted to share it with others. Although my life has been nothing like Smithy Ide's, there were aspects that hit home; and McLarty writes so that you really experience it all through Smithy's eyes. It's quite moving. I borrow most of what I read from the library (book collection out of control); but I wanted the hard-bound version of this for myself, which says a lot."
3,Great Book Club Book,"""Smithy"" Ide is the kind of character who gets under your skin. At the start of the book I thought it would be so predictable that it would get boring. The author, however, has big plans for Smithy. His character descriptions are so direct and his writing so good that I felt as though Smithy was speaking to me - that doesn't happen very often. I did feel compassion for Smithy and cheered him on. Although some of the ""incidents"" along the way are somewhat far-fetched, I still liked the book. Bethany, Smithy's dead sister, also has a persona that one can almost feel. My only fault with this book was that it sort of petered out at the end; I guess I wanted a more dramatic finish.I would recommend this book for book clubs. I'd rate it a 3 for good writing."
5,The Memory of Running: A Novel,"The best book I've read in a long time. I'm so glad Stephen King ""discovered"" this author and look forward to reading more of his, Ron McLarty's, work."
3,I won't be afraid to shop with this dealer again,The item came within the predicted time line. I won't be afraid to shop with them again.
3,This is a sampler--not the 5 disc set,"Thinking I was getting a great price on the 5 disc Tristan und Isolde, I bought this item. I was surprised when only one disc was delivered and then noticed on the CD cover, Highlights. The cover of this CD and the 5 disc set is identical, except for the fine print. If I had been more careful I would have seen there was only one disc in description of the item. My mistake and I hope others don't make the same one.As to performance it is certainly enjoyable and if one does not want to sit through the whole five discs, this will do just fine."
3,My first book on PCOS,"This was the first book I bought for PCOS so that I could understand a little more about it. I agree with some other reviewers that the tone is a little patronizing, and slightly condesending- but I don't feel like it's intentional at all. The book has a lot of good information.It does hard on the holistic approach, and all-natural way of eating....I guess you have to expect some of idealistic fodder when you are reading a health related book. I felt disconnected from Harris- which is unfortunate considering she should have been able to bring it to a more personal level since Carey contributed for the medical portion. All in all- it's a good guide though- with a lot of information, a little harping, but for the good of understanding I could get past it to read on."
2,"Basic, superficial information","This book is good for someone who has been newly diagnosed and is looking for more information. However, all of the information - plus more - is readily available for free online at reputable sites such as INCIID.org and PCOSupport.org. And, now that PCOS is being researched and treated with more respect, our knowledge base on the subject is changing almost daily. The information contained in this book will soon be out of date. I would not recommend this book and instead would refer others to the sites mentioned above for the most up-to-date information available, plus excellent support services."
1,not a good source for infertility information,"If you are looking for information on medical treatments and want to go beyond ""the pill"" this is not the book for you. I am infertile because of PCOS, and picked up this book looking for some sort of support. I should have looked elsewhere. Don't waste your money!"
5,Excellent album,"This album was put together after Hendrix died. Regardless the essence of Hendrix is captured wonderfully. Several of the tracks here are first rate, my favorite being ""With The Power"". ""Message To Love"" and ""Stone Free Again"" are also classic tracks. This is a must have for any Hendrix enthusiast."
4,Alan Douglas Was Not All Bad!,"Though much maligned in later years, I've always thought this was Douglas' best work with the Hendrix archives. Coming after the often inconsistent and uninspired tracks on ""War Heroes"" and ""Loose Ends"", ""Crash Landing"" was full of fire and energy and received very positive reviews in its day. True, it's not pure Hendrix but Douglas' finished product was actually quite an improvement over the masters. The fact is that Hendrix would jam in the studio with just about anybody and the overdubbed percussion tracks are far superior to those on the original masters. No, it's not pure Hendrix but Jimi's talent and spirit shine through. Definitely worth a listen."
4,Long lost Hendrix album,"I had this album when I was a teen and lost it somehow,who knows. It kind of haunted me. One day I thought I would try to find it, there it was! Thanks to Amazon music. Is Crash Landing a must have,no. But for me it is. A good solid Hendrix album with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. I think it is a little lost gem,well worth having. ThanksAmazon!"
3,full of overdubs,"While I do and did enjoy this recordings it is important to understand that in fact the album was put together using various tracks in various forms of completion. Message of Love With the Power are kept pretty much in tact to how they were recorded. Over the rainbow ,stone free again, Peace in Mississippi,come hard down on me baby uses the basic same song structure but new modern bass and drums. If you want to hear how they were recorded check out the box set or south saturn Delta. Captain Coconut was actually part of jam that was edited using another jam. So I guess if you are purist you don't want this cd. If you collect you love it. At the time when this and Midnight Lightning came out it was sold as new unreleased hendrix with lots of excitement. The new producer claimed that this was the ""new direction"" I guess it could have been worse and I am sure most are familar enough with the story behind these tracks"
3,Not worth the money,"I had heard a lot of bad things about the Alan Douglas produced Jimi albums so I never purchased one until now. It was expensive at over $30 but I had an amazon certificate and am a Jimi fanatic. This was one of the few Jimi albums I had never listened to so I was really looking foward to hearing something new. Now I can look foward to this album collecting dust on my cd rack for years to come. I have no idea if all the stories about Jimi's parts being erased or rerecorded by session musicians are true but the album just isn't very good. On some of the songs you can tell the choices made were not Jimi's and the session guitar, bass, and drums are not on the level of Jimi or any of his regular bandmates. Overall the songs aren't terrible but I don't feel the need to listen to them over and over again. I would only suggest this album for somebody who wants to collect everything of Jimi's."
2,Any true fan of Hendrix knows this is crap,"I bought this album when it first came out and was very disappointed because the original musicians were erased and studio musicians who never played with Hendix were overdubbed in their place. Capt. Coconut is kinda neat, flamenco, psychedelic Hendrix. However the rest is marred by Alan Douglas's poor decision to re-record the backing musicians. Its not the way Hendrix intended it to be heard and is comparable to someone ""improving"" a picasso painting by changing the colors to conform to their living room. El Stinko. This album should be avoided."
2,Douglas stuffed it up,"Don't believe the other review, this isn't Jimi at his best, it's done with overdubs from musicians who didn't even know Jimi.Avoid like the plague.Novelty value only."
1,This is music without Soul - it's the sound of Hendrix being raped,"Crash Landing is Hendrix stripped of all soul and feeling. It's a grotesque release only surpassed by Midnight Lightning in lack of musical integrity. I hope all fans of this garbage wake up one day and find Hendrix's real music, and realize why no fan of Hendrix's art rates this piece of turd as worth anything more than the trash can. Go and search out the original pre-Douglasized tracks, they are all a bit longer, a bit unstructured, but have got something this sterile release completely lacks - soul and feeling. Sorry about your loss Bob Booey! Still, by the look of the reviews here I'm sure you'll find some poor sucker you can get rid of it to."
3,good and not so good to boring.,"I only like three songs out of this lot.""They all Laughed,"" You and Me"" That's What God Looks Like To Me."" Sinatra didn't want this Album published,but somehow it got out!!And in a way,I'm glad."
4,enjoyable toy,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old son and he really enjoys playing with the imagination Desk, and Clifford is his favorite. He has been learning all about winter, fall, spring and summer. The tape is a little hard to insert into the desk, but this is a great toy!!! My son loves to color and can play for hours."
3,Too pricey,"A little pricey for a coloring/work book, The cassette is only useful for this book. I can't afford many of these, so my grandchildren get very limited play time with this"
2,Uneven and lacking sufficient illustrations,"I yield to no one in my admiration for Dr. Nuland's story telling, writing skills, or speaking eloquence. However, THE WISDOM OF THE BODY is not a successfully made book. It mixes together fascinating clinical stories with monotonous, drawn out descriptions of the body's functions. Nuland does not always succeed in conveying the body's anatomy and physiology to the reader, and the result is often a restless boredom. This book has only 8 or 9 illustrations, and should have used ten times that many if readers are to understand the complex concepts Nuland discusses. As a fellow surgeon, I enjoyed reading Nuland's personal case histories, but there are much better books to consult for educating one's self on the wisdom of the body. (A few examples: Tortora and Agnostakos TEXTBOOK OF PHYSIOLOGY, Frank Netter's CIBA illustrations, or Dr. Paul Brand's FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE.)"
5,AWESOME BOOK,I LOVE VANESSA MILLER BOOKS. SHE IS A GREAT WRITER. I LOVE THE RAIN SERIES. ITS A MUAT READ BOOK

1,Just a couple of things to consider...,"1. It is possible that the Pentagon ordered Flight 93 to be shot down and it could very well have been. People reported seeing the plane come down in fiery chunks. If they ever acknowledge this, ""Let's Roll!"" is going to become as trite as ""Where's the beef?"" and you'll want to hide this book in the closet somewhere.2. Look who's on the cover of the book. Hey it's not Todd Beamer. It's, hey, it's Lisa! Do you think she's trying to cash in on what presumably happened on 9-11?Nyah. ;-)"
1,The book is just the beginning...,"We've got a potential franchise here folks. What about ""Let's Roll: The Movie""? Maybe some Todd and Lisa action figures. Hey, she needs to make the most of her 15 minutes of fame. GOD BLESS AMERICA!"
4,Her Own Way,"After reading some of the very negative reviews about ""Let's Roll"" I felt compelled to put in a good word for Lisa Beamer and her book. The book is not GREAT literature, nor is it meant to be. It is a personal story of how Lisa Beamer dealt with the tragedy in her life, and how God was the One who pulled her through, and continues to be central in her life. I did not feel she was being ""preachy"", but honest and genuine. I do not think that she was looking for media attention, but because of the heroism her husband displayed, I think she was trying to honor him, and honor God. I have much respect for this woman, and admire her courage and faith in God during such a horrible time in her young life. It's a good book, an interesting and honest peek into the life of a 9/11 widow."
1,regrets,"I regret that I have to agree with some of the negative reviews of this book. I have found the stories of quiet courage displayed by many of the survivors, family of victims, and others suffering loss on 9/11 more inspirational than this book. It is simply not that remarkable in terms of inspiration or literary worth. I have read stories in the newspapers that affected me more. There is a grieving widow who is paying for surgery for children. There is another who is raising money for teens. Neither one has their photo plastered on the front of a book cover. I got the very uneasy feeling from the book that the author wrote it to prolong her fame."
2,HDWK - How do we know?,"This book depicts events that are still yet to be proven true (or false). Whether or not the passengers of Flight 93 brought the plane down themselves, their bravery and legacy will not be diminished. However, the government is not releasing the cockpit voice recording. Also the Pentagon will not confirm nor deny that Flight 93 was shot down. Eyewitness accounts in PA state tht the plane fell to the ground in several pieces and in flames. You be the judge. Until this is proven true, I cannot accept it as truth."
5,Extraordinary courage exhibited by both Lisa and Todd Beamer,"The American people owe a huge debt of gratitude to Todd Beamer and the other passengers of flight 93. Lisa Beamer's book lets us get to know about Todd Beamer's life before September 11. It also offers insight on how Lisa Beamer has managed to go on with her life after that horrible day. She pays tribute to the other passengers and crew on board flight 93.Both Todd and Lisa Beamer have shown extraordinary courage under extraordinary circumstances, and Lisa Beamer continues to provide a fine example of faith and dignity."
5,Truly Inspiring!!!,"I wish all Americans had Lisa Beamers faith. I read it cover to cover over a few days time and it made me want to be a better person. I loved the stories of their homelife, courting, childhoods, and struggles they had to overcome as a family. Their faith is remarkable. They were just an ordinary family living day to day trying to make the best decisions for their children. Lisa didn't invite public scrutiny to be a part of her life and she didn't expect all those invitations for interviews. She is not profiting off the book for herself or the tragedy itself. She gave an honest account of her faith in God and how it has helped her. Shame on those who say otherwise. Maybe they need to RE-READ the book. They missed something the first time. God Bless You and your family Lisa Beamer."
1,One story out of thousands,"One would imagine that the loved ones of everyone who died at the hands of terrorists on September 11, 2001 has a story at least as interesting as Lisa Beamer has. They just didn't get the media and political attention that she did. An attractive woman, she makes a good poster child for the tragedy.This is a dull book. The most interesting part concerns what supposedly happened on Flight 93. Unfortunately it is all speculation.I read it at the library. You should too if you want to read it. Spend your money on something else.One thing I have wondered about which this book doesn't answer: What were the other passengers doing while Todd was on the telephone? It seems they got everything planned without his help and he gets the glory with ""Let's roll""."
2,NOT my bible thumping cup of tea...,"This book was not at all what it was marketed as, nor was it what I expected. In my opinion, the frequent references to God, numerous bible passages, and the author's clear assumption that GOD is the only way to achieve hope distracted from what would otherwise be a heart breaking story of hope, leaving the reader to take what they may from her experiences and her husband's legacy . As a reader who admires Mrs. Beamer I was anxious to read this book, but quickly found its religious overtones to be alienating and at times, even preachy.Hers is a truly remarkable story and I admire her strength and composure in telling it and I am grateful that her faith has seen her and her family through the unimaginable.I had hoped that the ""moral"" of the book would be more along the lines of accept the path ahead of you rather than accept GOD and only GOD."
1,"Oh great. Let's capitalize on our tragedy, shall we?","This book is one more example of the shameless commercialization of grief that became popular in this country after 9/11. In another generation, Lisa Beamer would have borne her grief with some dignity. Now she feels the need to shove her whole relationship and life down our throats and by the way, give us some gratuitous Christian testimony on the side. ""Let's roll"" is an overused, overhyped phrase. The fact that this woman goes on speaking tours to exhibit her grief makes me sick. Making a bestseller out of tragedy just shows that even a horrible event like 9/11 in this day and age can turn into a big bankroll for somebody. Gone are the days when people bore up under grief and soldiered on...now we have to make everything public. Here's an idea: take the money you would have spent on this book and donate it to a charity."
5,kw,"OR, and this is ""just a thought""! - maybe she is NOT looking or wealth and celebrity, but trying to find something to make her feel closer to her husband, and to give her some type of peace, if possible, despite his horrible murder. and yes, los angeles (see ""review"" below) you go ahead and move on with your little life - enough grief? you were as far away from the WTC on that day as you can be, so you can sweep it under the rug, but others of us were not. others of us in downtown Manhattan and elsewhere saw our brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, friends and other relatives die that day. we can not, and will not forget."
1,Dreadful but short,"This book is clearly the work of a hack writer (Ken Abraham) who took whatever might have been of value in Lisa Beamer's story and reduced it to a kind of Christian mush. Beamer is a woman of courage and dignity, but there is nothing whatsoever in her story that interests or inspires. More off-putting than the book's heavy-handed Christian sentimentality is its failure to develop any narrative momentum. Let's Roll is a kind of prolonged vacuum desperately seeking the ending we all know is coming."
4,"Pleasant, easy, uplifting reading","This was a well written, easy to read book. It focuses not only on the life before and after 9/11 of the Beamer family but also on their faith and beliefs that brought them through this awful experience. We learn of a man who was dedicated to his beliefs, his family and his work (often to a fault).Lisa also shows how her faith in God brought her through this experience and provided her the strength to consider the needs of others that also went through this terrible ordeal.Whether you have the same beliefs as Lisa or not, you'll find her to be a woman of extreme strength and courage dedicated to her faith. She is also strong enough for this book to be a vehicle of sharing that faith with others.I found it uplifing and encouraging considering the traumatic events that caused Lisa to be brought into the limelight."
3,A hard book to review,"""Let's Roll"" by Lisa Beamer is one of the harder book for me to review. While I was reading the book, it was very clear to me that both Todd and Lisa Beamer had much faith, but at times it seemed to me that the point was being driven home to the reader and for some that could be a real turn-off. Another problem that I had with this book was ""Yes Todd Beamer did some that was very brave on 9-11-01, but other poeple also did very brave things and you didn't not see their families on TV or after the birth's their children they more than likely didn't get letter from the President Bush."" Lisa Beamer never explaimed why she felt that Todd and herself were being single out for so much attention when they were many heroes that day."
1,"Look at me, I'm media girl","I can't get enough of the lights camera and action. I'm the only one that counts, me me me. I'm going to sue to get the copyright to let's roll, time out, and merry christmas. enough of this woman already."
1,The Bible Thumper's Book of Platitudes.,"I picked up this book in a dentist's waiting room .. and it nearly made me wish I was the one in the chair.What could have been an interesting story about dealing with sudden loss was little more than the ""inspiration-lite"" stuff you'd find in a Family Circle article: banal, one-dimensional, and written at about a 5th-grade level (I'm guessing the publishers accurately predicted the educational level of their born-again target audience). No serious thought, no interesting insights. A McBook for those who like their simplistic platitudes laced with ham-handed Christian proselytization.If Lisa Beamer is not a Bible-thumper without an original thought in her head, she sure did a great impersonation of one.About the only good thing I can say about ""Let's Roll"" is that it's as short as its title.Unfortunately, it's about as thoughtful as the title too."
5,What an Inspiration!,"This book inspired me to have a closer relationship with God, cherish my family - especially my husband - and become a better person. What an amazing woman and the epitomy of what a Christ-like woman should be! The whole book just filled me with inspiration. Shame on these few reviewers who claim she was trying to cash in. She didn't receive a cent from this book - it went to her charitable foundation for parentless kids named for her husband. Just goes to show that some people will find the bad no matter what. But, the ones with Christ in the center of their lives, find the GOOD! Thank You, Lisa, for being an inpiration and a true servant of Christ."
5,True Messenger,"Lisa Beamer tells us who Todd Beamer was. She gives us insight into this modern-day hero. Lisa presents the Todd Beamer Foundation and the significance of the phrase, ""let's roll"" to her. She articulates the value of faith, hope, and love in our relationships. Lisa encourages all of us to apply these principles to our everyday lives...strong messages in this book!"
3,One Woman's Story,"Lisa Beamer does an excellent job writing a simple yet moving review of she and her husband Todd's relationship leading up to the tragedy of September 11, as well as depicting their unwaivering faith in God before, during and after the tragic situation they found themselves in. The crescendo of events from the time the plane went down through the unraveling of what likely happened aboard that doomed flight, and straight into the media frenzy that followed, Lisa Beamer clearly set forth a goal to enlighten the world to her story and imortalize Todd with the words that share the title of this book. It is a goal she certainly acheives, regardless of how her writing seems to compell readers one minute, and almost repel them the next with a few too many disjointed, one line references to Todd's endearing personality traits; the same one line references that make this book as sweet and valid a testament to family emergency and survival as any I have read."
3,I feel for her but who knows what really happened.,"After reading the book I was left with a feeling of speculation.No one knows what happened on the plane which took 44 people totheir deaths.I had a sense of sadness when she kept bringingup ""God's Will"" Sometmes human beings make choices wetherpositive or negative which unfortunatley determine other'sdestiny.We also don't know how many other passengers were involved in this or if the hijackers simply gave up and had afight and the plane crashed.Ok,I have to say I feel there wasmuch Christian dogma presented in the book.I can understand how Lisa could find it comforting but at times it comes across asmore of a book of preaching than experience from a great andhorrible loss.I feel for her and the book gave importantgeneral information."
3,Beamer Memory Book,"This book isn't what I thought it would be. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I felt drawn to Lisa because of our similar age and family situation.Through reading this book, I felt more like this book was written for Lisa's children. Maybe they are the ones who she had in mind while writing this book, because the book oozed with details that I feel would be most special to her children and family as time goes on. At times, I almost felt like I was intruding into another family's life. But, how easy we can forget those details unless they are written down. I can imagine this book will be the most special and important to her children and family as they grow older."
4,Add This One to Your List,"I completely disagree with the Switzerland review. I don't think Lisa tried to give the ""right"" interpretation for scriptures, but rather, the right interpretation for herself. I think she's doing what seems to be quite a tremendous job of coping with this horrific situation. Furthermore, if you'd have preferred to see her fade away from the limelight following the attacks, then why did you bother to read her book?! I found it to be inspirational and think that it's worth reading"
3,Adifficult book to review but felt Lisa is sincere..,"A difficult book to review. I commend Lisa Beamer for sharing her story and sharing her grief. The book gave us a glimpse into just one victim and their family on that fateful day, Sept 11th. Mrs. Beamer has been blessed with a wonderful support system, good friends and family. The story cannot be judged as good or bad, it is what it is. I felt wanting in certain areas to know more about Todd and Lisa's early marriage and the trip they took to Italy on their last vacation. I also felt that Todd was a wonderful husband and father but at times it felt like when we put those gone on a pedestal. But then again Lisa may have been fortunate enough to have had a uniquely wonderful marriage. I think it is a great book to give to someone that may be grieving. Would recommend"
3,children and adults will love this,"Nicely-done animated version of HEIDI, based on the novel by Johanna Spyri. Young Heidi is sent to live with her gruff grandfather in the Alps. Her kind nature soon endears her to the mountainfolk as well as her grandfather, and their lives are very happy, until Heidi is taken away to Frankfurt, as a companion for the lame Klara.Although this version comes from the series of Goodtimes animated classics (which aren't exactly masterpieces of animation), the quality of the animation in HEIDI is quite lush and the characters are drawn in the Japanese Anime style. The heart and humanity of Spyri's story comes across very well, and adults (as well as children) will find themselves happily caught up in Heidi's world. Highly-recommended."
1,Inappropriate and Disrespectful,"I did not approve of this DVD at all. The picture and sound quality were very poor; but what I mainly disapproved of was the picture of Jesus on the cross. He was completely naked. This is highly inappropriate and disrespectful. I was going to put this DVD in the church library but I cannot now. If I could get a refund on this, I would. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the LORD."
3,Better for Tea than Coffee,"Loose Tea: Works Great, highly recommendCoffee: Needs work, it lets quite a few grounds through and clean up is worse than with the tea. I followed directions, coarse grind, followed the time it recommends for brewing.Overall: If you are using this for loose leaf tea I would say go for it, but if it is for coffee be a bit wary. I found this item at my local grocery store for 3x the price here on amazon which is why I gave it a shot."
2,Travel Press Review-Bodium,"Price - goodDurability - Poor. Cracked when dropped from three feet onto a wooden floor.Function - Fair. Course ground coffee still got through the filter.Overall the coffee made in this press came out excellent once you got rid of the grounds mixed in with the coffee. I use the darkest roast, such as Italian or espresso roast, ground coursly.Great idea, just be careful with it!"
1,Waste of money,"I use a regular Bodum press at home every morning to make my coffee and would use nothing else. I bought this to travel with and take on a camping trip so I could have real coffee. They way it is made, it only has a little rubber gasket around the edge of the plunger, and no matter how slowly you push the press, most of the grounds get by and into the coffee. Also, there is no screen at the top to strain out the grounds, so unless you like eating coffee grounds with your breakfast, I would steer clear of this product."
1,"Everything good, but grounds in the coffee","A key part of a coffee press is keeping the grounds out of the coffee; this press can't do that. As others have noted, the seal seems loose and allows even large grounds through when pressed. Fine if used and then poured into a mug to allow to settle, which is obviously a problem for a travel mug. I have a cheapo travel camping press that makes a better seal than this! It's too bad too, because the capacity, insulation, and drinking spout are all nice. I contacted Bodum to complain and never got a response. Unless you like chewy coffee, avoid this!"
3,Be careful how you use it...,"I have had one of these for about five years. I use it at work, and it works just fine. Sometimes, some tea sneaks past the plunger, but this is not a big hairy deal.I bought one for my daughter for Christmas, and she put it into the dishwasher. The threads were deformed by the heat in the dishwasher, leaving it worthless. C'est la vie..."
1,"Great concept, bad execution","I was very excited to get this at the price, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. The concept of this was perfect for the office since I prefer French pressed coffee. However, the problem with this device is that the rubber ring does not make contact with the glass at the top. This causes grounds to be left in your coffee. Not sure why they made the glass slightly larger at the top. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Cheap Plastic & Tapered Inside,"Like many other reviewers, I usually ended up with coffee grounds in my mouth.The mug is tapered on the inside, which defies logic. It doesn't help that the plastic on the edge of the filter is very flimsy. Had I kept it, I doubt it would have lasted more than a few months of everyday use.The insulation was nice, and I sometimes used this as a travel mug for coffee made in other presses, so I give it two stars."
1,Don't bother,Don't bother with this one. The tapered sides allow a lot of grounds to get by. Also my mug cracked from the heat (I think) and liquid leaks to the inside from both inside and out. Not worth the money. Lasted only 2 weeks...
3,Bodum travel press,"When I received the travel press I unscrewed the top only to have the ""press"" unscrew from the plunger and remain stuck at the bottom. I sent an e-mail to the company about this and got no reply. I mailed the travel press back to the company with a detailed letter and asked for a replacement. Shortly thereafter, I received a replacement and I was very pleased with that service. I had another one of these that broke unfortunately so I bought the replacement. Why Bodum would design the mug so the filter screen unscrews with the lid is beyond me."
2,Not for TEA,"When making tea, you have to push it down really really slowly and even then some leafs make it through to the top. Not recommended for making tea."
2,Travel french press,"I like the look and feel of the cup, it makes great coffee. I have had a little problem with grounds escaping into my drink when the plunger is near the top (the cup seems a little tapered and the plunger doesn't seal as tight at the top as it does at the lower half) I wish the plunger where a bit longer, there is always 2 swallows of coffee that can't be drank."
1,Chunky Coffee,"I recently bought this product, for only 4.00. Not a bad deal can make enough coffee for just me on my way into work. However after I get to work I poor out all the coffee into another mug, clean out the Bo-dumb and then repress the coffee to help get out most of the chunks. This mug leaves chunks of coffee no matter what. I do not use fine grinds, I only use a french press at home. This thing is terrible its such a hassle to use. The rubber around the press just does not catch the grinds.This will go on a camping trip with my boyfriend for a quick fix to make coffee, they wont mind chunky coffee in a pinch."
2,Good in theory; less so in practice,"I had this mug for a few months before it cracked and the double-lined wall filled with water. Sadly, it is now landfill.The two major weaknesses of this product--hit upon by almost all reviewers--are: 1) the plastic lip on the press lets grounds pass through, leaving bits in your coffee, and 2) it cracks easily. Granted, I tend to be rough on my travel-ware (the gym-home-school-work circuit has really done a number on my SIGG bottle), but this mug died even without any trauma.Both problems would be solved if the mug was double-walled glass, which would both solve the cracking problem (unless you dropped it) and would allow for a metal mesh lip around the press--just like the other, non-travel Bodum products... which work fine.Good idea in theory; less than successful in practice."
1,If you like grounds in your coffee,this thing is horrible. I always have coffee grounds in my coffee. this is a big waste of money. only buy it if you like grounds in your coffee and feel like wasting money.if you must have french press coffee. use a another press and just pour the coffee in this thing. you will not have coffee grounds then hopefully.
2,Subpar product from bodum,"This press is inferior to other bodum french presses. The silicon seal along the plunger is not tight enough to seal against grounds slipping past, regardless of the size of your grind. Also, as other users have observed, mine cracked after a few uses and I've never put it in the dishwasher.I do not suggest buying this product unless you like gritty coffee."
2,Disappointing,"I have owned two of these, the first for about 2 years, the second for about 6 months. The plastic cracks, on my second one after just about 3 months. I'll be looking for another alternative. They have redesigned the plunger part of it so it lets almost no grounds through, and the coffee is good."
2,Pretty Crappy,"While I love french press coffee and am a fan of Bodum products, they always tend to be on the fragile side. The outside plastic on this travel press cracked within the first two weeks of using it. The material is less than what one would call ""sturdy"" and the press routinely lets stray grounds through even though I've been following the manufacturer's suggestions and using coarse coffee.Great in theory, much less so in execution."
1,Filter does not work at all,"As the happy owner of two other Bodum coffee presses, I expected an effective product. The most important function of a coffee press is to separate the grounds from the drink. This coffee press completely failed in that function.Both on medium grind coffee grounds and loose Chinese tea, the press allowed a significant amount of material to pass.For example, 1 mm thick tea branches floated up past the silicone sides.The basic problem is poor design: despite good quality plastics and metal stem, the silicone border is not rigid enough and not large enough to grip the cylinder wall. I do NOT see any material defects in the cup -- it just works poorly.However, the top lid is quite sturdy and comfortable. Useful as an overpriced hot drink mug for cocoa or milk."
4,No more Barney Miller coffee at work,"The coffee club at work is hit or miss, but mostly miss for my tastes. I'm not a coffee expert, but it has to be more than brown water. This let's me make a nice strong cup of coffee. I would give it 5 stars if it had a strainer to keep out the chunks at the very end of the cup. I have made many cups it it's still going strong."
3,"Good, not great...","This is a good value, but it's not a Lexus... you get what you pay for. Despite my rant, IT MAKES A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE!!!However...1) Filtration is mediocre - grind your bean a little less fine. If you buy bean and grind them at the store on the ""Bunn-o-Matic"", try the PERCOLATOR setting!2) PREVIOUS Bodum models had a second filter screen at the mouth port. I miss it, but admit that the new unit is easier to clean.3) It is plastic. It WILL hit the ground - it's Murphy's law of coffee mugs. IF it does, it will break.4) It costs ""only"" about ten bucks. Great if you're on a budget.5) If money is not an object, then spend more of it and get one of the PLANETARY DESIGNS units... Ooh La La!!! (Here is a link to one of their products!)Planetary Design Desk Press Stainless Steel French Press Cornflower Blue"
2,Ok if you enjoy a mouthful of grounds...,"I liked the whole idea of being able to make and drink my coffee out of the same thing, but it just doesn't work. The plunger seems really cheap and allowed at least 25% of the grounds to pass through leaving you with (for lack of a better description) ""chunky"" coffee. I would not recommend this product."
4,"good, but one flaw",very nice....perfect for those who travel a lot. only one problem.... there is too much space at the bottom of the cup (the plunger doesn't go down far enough). There is about 2 inches of space in the bottom of the cup for coffee grounds (and therefore 'trapped' coffee that I can't drink !!). They should have designed the plunger to go just a little further down in the cup. Otherwise... it's great!
2,Faulty seal,Within 3 months of purchase liquid built up inside the walls of the mug. I had always washed it by hand as suggested by the manufacturer.
2,Very Fragile,"While this product performs as advertised (yes, it lets a few grounds/leaves through, but so does a normal French press) and is very convenient, it is also fragile. I had one for six months, until it fell out of my bag and cracked when it hit the ground. After arguing with customer service for a week (it was given as a gift and naturally didn't have a receipt), I got a replacement, and just today (three months later) a short drop broke the already-fragile connection between the two sides of the tumbler. They won't replace the product again, 1-year warranty notwithstanding.Treat it like thin glass, basically."
3,"great idea, 1 design flaw","i have to say that i do love it and use it every day, but, the one flaw is that the stem screws into the lid in the same direction. it has such a tight seal on the rubber gasket around the screen that when you unscrew it, it occasionally unscrews the screen stem from the screen, then you have to dig the screen out. i wish they would have put reverse threads on the stem and this would eliminate the one flaw in an otherwise great product!just remember to tighten the stem after every use."
1,Not worth the effort,"I travel often and enjoy making my own coffee instead of relying on the coffee and coffee makers supplied in many hotel guest rooms, so I was looking for a plastic press I could easily pack and not worry about breakage.Sadly, this press doesn't live up to the normal Bodum quality. The seal on the plunger doesn't seal well at all, and you end up with a mouthful of grounds in the bottom of your cup. I ended up carrying a small sieve and filters with me to filter out the grounds, which really made it too much trouble to make a cup of coffee in the mornings. Thankfully the lovely agents of the TSA alleviated the problem for me on this last trip as they rearranged all the items I had packed in my suitcase, dislodging the press from its safe, cushioned location and it arrived broken into pieces."
1,"Great idea, until it broke.","I purchased this exactly a year ago and have used it on a few trips. I was on a cross-country trip last week and used the unit for about the tenth time. It broke. As I pushed the plunger down I heard a crack. I now have coffee in between the inner and outer shells of the mug. Sadly, I will throw this away and purchase a better-quality unit for my travels. Nothing is better than having a good cuppa while on the road, and nothing was worse than that crack I heard, making this unit useless.I have two Bodum glass presses at home that I use several times a day; they continue to perform yeoman service."
2,Bodum should be ashamed..,"I've used Bodum French press pots for years. When I saw this, I thought it would be the perfect camping alternative to a barely functional stovetop percolator that we use.Wrong! The cup part is excellent, holding liquids hot for a long period without burning your hand. BUT, the filter mechanism is terrible. Even a child would see that the silicon ring that is supposed to keep the grounds below the filter would not work. It is far too soft and pliable to do anything at all. The result - no matter how slow you press or how careful you are, this is 'cowboy coffee' - each sip is an unpleasant mouthful of grounds.I'd return this piece of junk in a heartbeat except that I got it on super-saver shipping and the shipping would eat up the value of the return. So, I ordered a $4 Melitta travel coffee maker that hopefully will fit on top of this nice cup! Maybe between the two of them, I can get one decent product.As a longtime Bodum fan, I'd have to advise you NOT to order this item."
1,The empirical basis of this book is severely lacking,"This book purports to be ""provocative"" and ""important."" It is neither. The empirical basis for the book is in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of ""political actors."" They apparently reveal what public opinion is. The big question is: Who cares what these political actors think? I might as well go ask my grandmother what public opinion is. It would be just as provactive and interesting. In this book, Prof. Herbst attempts to understand what public opinion is by asking others. In her previous book ""Numbered Voices"" she attempted to do this by looking at historical references. Here is a newsflash for Prof. Herbst: There is no such thing as public opinion -- stop wasting your time and ours."
1,You don't need it,"I have been dumping mine in the trash can for 5 years now.... never bought one. It can be messy, so take care when dumping it."
3,waste container,"I used the original one for a year and emptied it when it got full and cleaned the ""lens"" off and that seemed to work well. About the time I got a new one of these the whole printer quit working. My husband is a network manager and wasn't able to fix it. So we got a new one of another brand."
4,Good Value,"This item was a good purchase. The equipment works well. It was a good value for the price paid. I haven't needed it often, but it is nice to have around when I do."
4,three wheel adjustment time consuming,"High quality unit, prior to this builders level had always had 4 wheel adjustment, much easier & faster than this 3 wheel. Must have missed that detail in reviews and description. Otherwise pleased with unit."
4,A Somewhat Handy Little Guide,"This book doesn't contain an overwhelming amount of text, but does provide black-and-white pictures of a number of magickal seals. This book covers an eclectic variety of seals: Seals of Solomon, Seals from the 6th & 7th Books of Moses, Abra-Melin squares, Anna Riva's voodoo veves and more. There is precious little text, but if you need a brief guidebook providing basic identification of commonly used occult seals, this might prove to be helpful. Its primary use would be as an identification tool, to be used in conjunction with other magickal texts."
4,"Many seal are ok, but not all","this book show a lot of seals and symbols of magic I found a good symbols very usefull like the goetia seals an the seals of anna riva(to colect money,protection etc.)this anna riva's seals realy works with a correct consacration, but about the voodoo veves are all wrong."
1,A copier-coller of coarseness !,"Don't waste your money, the only secret of this peace of scribble is the Anna Riva's greediness !Try The Complete Book of Amulets and Talismans of Migene Gonzalez-Wippler. Vol 1 not 2."
2,Needs more info,"This is not a review! This is a request for more info on this product. Accuracy? Working range? Manual, or self level? please E-mail me more info so that I may decide if this product is right for me. Thank you"
4,More info needed,Agreed with the first respond. Questions: -What is included : tripod ? measurement pole? -Procedure of measurement? same as other laser?
3,"Made for a good listen, but..",sounded way too much like a summary of the events (good history lesson) rather than historical fiction! There was barely any dialogue! Maybe the actual book is better.
3,Almost 2 for 1,"This is easily Jeff Shaara's best novel. It doesn't slow down like ""Rise to Rebellion"" . He is slowly getting away from the temptation to tell instead of show, but it still happens at times. This book easily could have been two novels, which would have given more space to describe more of the Revolution in detail. A few small chapters seem inserted just to name drop historical figures like John Paul Jones soley to say it covers all the important figures There are so few novels about this important war, that Shaara should get some credit for raising attention and interest in it. However, I still am skeptical that he will ever reach the level of his father's ""The Killer Angel"". I would recommend ""The Glorious Cause"" to any history buff or anyone curious about American History."
4,My Favorite Sharra Book.,"I consider myself a fan of Jeff's work, though sometimes I must admit to finding some of the books a little slow. I would have to say that this is the best one I've read from him. Although the first book in this series is important for its setup, this is the heart of the American Revolution. I enjoyed reading about the struggles Washington faced in holding this ragtag force together, while battling his own Congress and Generals' betrayal. Recommended!"
5,birth of a glorious nation...,"With RISE TO REBELLION and THE GLORIOUS CAUSE, Jeff Shaara has given us a definitive history of the American Revolution. With his carefully researched history and viewpoint from the characters viewpoint we are treated to a front row seat of the birth of our nation. How he creates such vivid characterizations and blends it with the historical facts is an amazing story. This story will leap off the pages and fire up your imagination. I found THE GLORIOUS CAUSE to be my favorite Jeff Shaara novel to date. Great storytelling. Great writing that will make the pages fly by. Incredible history lesson. Just good stuff!"
5,Another Great Shaara Novel,"""The Glorious Cause"" is the second book in a two-volume series chronicling the American Revolution. Written in typical Shaara fashion, the story is told from the multiple perspectives of the war's major figures. If you enjoyed Jeff Shaara's previous novels on the Civil War and the Mexican War you will not be disappointed in either ""The Glorious Cause"" or ""Rise to Rebellion,"" the first book of the series.I am a big fan of Jeff Shaara and have read all of his books to-date. I think that all readers should understand that Shaara does not write history books per se. Rather he writes wonderful fiction told in historical settings. I am sure that he does his due diligence in researching the facts before undertaking his novels. But if some of the facts don't jive with the true historians then so be it. That should not diminish one iota the pure enjoyment of reading this novel. High school history class should have been so enjoyable."
5,Great Book,This book was a gift for my son-in-law who has read all of Jeff Shaara's books. Ordered and received very quickly. Great service and price as always.
4,silly raptor review,"The Glorious Cause is a great novel on the American Revloution by Jeff Shaara. The book has great character develoment, a lot of action, and a great, historical plot. Another thing that makes the book great is that Shaara uses all of the literary elements. I like the book because the tone of Jeff Shaara was serious, and descriptive. That was nice because Shaara is not biast when presenting the information. The book was a lot better than the first book because Shaara strong writing action, not polotics."
5,THE Classic of World Literature,"The best edition of this great work that I have yet to see. The notes are outstanding, the background material useful, and the commentary erudite. A must edition for the serious study of Cervantes."
4,Morph meets caveman,"How did man find fire, how did cavemen cope with the common cold and what to do when the dinosaur comes calling. Find the amswer to these and other common day problems in GOGS. A clay animation that rivals Aardman for its humour and morph for it's violence. A treat for the whole family."
1,overly strict return policy,"I ordered this item as a gift for someone else. When she opened the package, the comforter cover was very wrinkled, so she ironed it and placed it over her comforter. It wrinkled badly within minutes. When I tried to return it for this reason, I was told it could not be returned because it had been ironed and was not ""factory folded"". The item had only been out of the package for a short time (less than an hour) and had been immediately repackaged as it was quickly clear that there were major problems with wrinkling. Apparently, anyone who orders this item needs to be certain that they are willing to keep it as it is almost impossible to return. So... don't order if you're planning on taking it out of the package before you decide whether to keep it or not! I will not be ordering from this company again."
2,"great color, scratchy cotton","I had been looking for twin duvets in this color for a while and was excited to finally find these. The color did not disappoint. And a twin comforter fits quite easily into the opening.The downsides are: (1) it emerges from the dryer very wrinkly, and (2) the cotton is quite rough and scratchy! If I had been able to feel the cotton beforehand I would not have bought this duvet."
2,Mediocre,"I thought this would be a great deal for the price, but cover was incredibly wrinkled upon washing and had no duvet ties to secure it. I've had it for a year, and buttons have popped off, etc. Seems cheaply made. However, I used it for one year in a dorm and it served its purpose. Just don't expect to use it for an extended period of time."
4,Love it! ~ Rich color and nice fabric,I wasn't sure if the color would be the same as in the photo but it was and I'm very pleased about that. The ironing wasn't fun because it's cotton but I hate ironing anyway. lol All around a great buy and purchase.
5,"Inexpensive, gorgeous, easy","I love this duvet cover. I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg yet I wanted quality. I also wanted the cute buttons rather than a zip in, and this one is it!The real color is just a tad darker than what it looks like in the picture but it is a lovely purple suited for any bedroom. Easy to get comforter in and out and I've already washed it a few times."
1,plum,thought this was a comforter because of the pic....turns out it was a very expensive...SHEET.... my bad... but it is very soft.
1,will not hold jersey card,"will not hold jersey card or any other thick card,,only holds normal thickness cards,what a waste of time can buy these any where"
5,Excellent mid to low price Blu-Ray player,"I did hours and hours of research before deciding to purchace this player. I look at every $200 or under Blu-ray player available, compared features vs. price, and clearly thought out what I wanted in a player. It is safe to say I made the right decision. I couldn't be happier with the decision. This player meets or exceeds the quality and functionality of any player on the market. The 1080p picture quality is just jaw dropping. If you have a decent HD T.V. and think your HD cable or satellite picture is great, you will not believe what you see with this blu-ray player. It's a major step on the evolutionary ladder of high definition."
3,"More Truthful Than Members of the ""Academy"" Would LIke To Admit","Former Alabama governor Fob James said he was familiar with and could handle any kind of politics until he discovered Univerisity politics, always personal, always petty and almost never about issues or philosophies for the common good.That's what this book is all about: the rough and tumble, always petty, always personal, world of campus politics.Funny, ironic, iconic, and small-minded, but more accurate than members of the ""academy,"" as they call themselves, would like to admit--but they, members of the Academy, are the ones who will enjoy this book the most--they will see all too many of their friends and colleagues in it. There is often truth, much truth, in satire and so it is with this book.Takes awhile to get into the rhythm and flow of the writing, but lots of humor, irony, and, unfortunately, truth in here...Members of ""the Academy"" will love it--if they have any sense of humor and perspective at all."
4,the best Russo,"***** I tried to revise my reviow from 4 to 5 stars, but the editor won't allow that. I have read several books by Richard Russo now, and this is my favorite. It is really funny. The situations Hank gets himself into are comical. Having been an English major myself, I enjoyed the send up of campus politics. This is a fun read."
5,Marvelous,"For many, many years I have searched in vain for a book that would be a match for my all time favorite, The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk. What a find to stumble across Straight Man. Richard Russo has that rare ability to bring his characters vividly to life using almost no descriptive prose. Hank Devereaix's congenital talent for self destruction in spite of his better intentions remind me a great deal of Mutiny's Willie Keith except that Willie eventually grew up. From cover to cover this book is a delightful comedy, and character study as well as a wonderful spoof on the world of academia. Being one who from time to time suffers from Reader's Block, this book also opened the door on the path back to discover all of Russo's talents in Nobody's Fool, Mohawk, and The Risk Pool. Please, Mr. Russo, keep tapping away."
5,Hilarious and perceptive,"This is a superbly constructed novel, with rich and varied characters enmeshed in multiple sub-plots. William Henry Devereau, Jr. will be remembered as one of the most brilliantly crafted characters in the academic satire genre."
5,Funny and Heart warming,"This is straight up one of the funniest books I've read. The situations in which the main character finds himself might ring false to anyone NOT in academe, but for anyone who has ever taught in a rural Small Liberal Arts College (SLAC), it is wonderful! The character is flawed, as usual, in Richard Russo's books, making him loveable, yet stubborn and frustrating to read about. Yet he is so well meaning that one can't help but love him.I couldn't help but love him. Maybe it's because I recognized him in the characters I see on campus every day."
5,Funny...,"William Henry Devereaux Jr., approaching 50, is the English chair of English at small town West Central Pennsylvania University. Budget cuts lead to fear of layoffs among the tenured university staff. This is one of the funniest serious novels that I have read where Russo humorously captures the life of academia and small town America. The novel's essence is captured brilliantly in Tom De Haven's book review in the NY Times Book Review (July 6, 1997)."
2,"A few mild smiles, chuckle at the end. Glad Im not in Acade",Sad that the talented characters in this academic setting do so little with their lives. There are more laughs in any sitcom. The final page gave me my biggest smile. All professors should spend at least ten years in real life. Their sense of humor saves them but amuses me little.
2,I don't get it.,"I must be missing something. I found this story about an ordinary college english teacher to be quite dull. Not funny at all, in fact I found Hank to be one of the most irritating characters of any book I've ever read, I think maybe he was supposed to be that way but why would anyone want to read about it!? Nothing happens in the week or so that this book takes place in his life at least nothing to write an entire novel about. My advice would be to skip it, there are so many other good books out there!"
1,Great reviews! Cool cover! What a bore!,Are all Russo's best pals in the book review business? The jacket and a couple of pages reading in the shop made me think I'd found something worthwhile. Funny? A couple of laughs here and there. The characters? All charmless bores. Bah!
1,Major Disappointment,"After reading the glowing reviews of Amazon readers, I rushed out to buy this book.I must confess that I found myself unable to finish it. The first 100 pages were so painfully bad that I finally gave up. There's not much to talk about because the plot is non-existent. Seinfeld was an uproariously funny show about nothing. Straight Man is a remarkably unfunny book about nothing. Don't waste your time or your money."
4,Real characters,"I loved reading ""Straight Man"". I usually read all bad reviews written at Amazon.com prior and after reading a book. The bad reviews in this case did not make my opionion on the book change an inch (as most times they do). Hank, the main character, is sometimes cynical and even rude, but underneath is a good guy. He likes his son in law, even knowing he cheated his loved daughter because he can emphathize with him. But he has scruples, and sends him away anyways. He has impulses to cheat on his wife, but loves her so much that he does not dare. He is nasty with most of his colleagues, but mainly because they take themselves to seriously.Hank is so real you want to smack him or be friends with him. Like any living person he alternates between being a great guy and a first class jerk.Read the book and you'll understand!"
4,One of the Best Campus Novels I've Read,"In an era when almost all of our writers are also professors, the campus novel or story has become a norm. Straight Man is, however, also a great read, accessible and entertaining to non-academics. The narrator is authentic and heartfelt. His sense of humor about love, academia, literature, and life in general elicits by turns gut-busting laughter and wry, ironic grins.The only other book of this sort as well-written and as entertaining is David Slavitt's The Cliff (LSU Press). I advise everyone to buy both of these books and settle in for some good laughs and some of the most quotable passages in American literature."
5,"Well written, funny and credible","Straight Man is a comedy about an English profess undergoing a mid-life crisis at the same time as his university is undergoing a budgetary crisis. As is typical of a Russo novel, the prose is often brilliant, the scenes and dialogue vibrant.. Many scenes border on the farcical, and are very funny, without detracting from the credibility of the characters. There is a large cast of characters, and while many are typical denizens of an academic novel, the professor's colleague Tony is a particulary fresh and delightful secondary character. The professor's relationship with his daughter is very well done, and Russo's portrayal of the professor's marriage is insightful; at the same time the wife's character is more described than developed Russo sometimes relies too much on ""shticks"", such as the use of Occam and the professor's sarcastic repartee. In summary, Straight Man is very enjoyable, well written, funny, and deals with credible people and relationships."
5,His Best Effort,"It is hard to believe, but Richard Russo has outdone himself. A dab hand at the craft of characterization and setting, Russo creates a landscape that has room for the elegance of medieval philosophy, the mind-numbing foolishness of academic life at a third-rate university, the inherent pathos of a man at mid-life, and the often transitory nature of even the most intimate of relationships. The bonus: Straight Man is laugh out loud funny. Read this book at once!"
3,3 1/2 stars...,"This book was, as most of Russo's are, a snap shot of time in the life of a small town guy. I enjoyed it. However, usually the snap shot encompasses a climactic event, and in this case I didn't feel like that was the case.While Hank was struggling with his school, friends, and children, I didn't feel like there was a real story underneath.Hank was well developed (as a character), and as usual, Russo's writing is more than noteworthy, but the other characters were slightly underdeveloped and you never got a feel for his daughter, his wife, or even his colleagues.I think that this time, Russo didn't do enough to develop the characters, and he spent a lot of time describing scenery and places ... I'd rather he had done more people, and fewer objects - in terms of description.If you want to start reading Russo, read Nobody's Fool or Empire Falls - those are each a better indicator of what Russo is really capable of."
5,Hidden Gem - Hilarious,"My sister came across this book at the Goodwill store and sent it to me in the mail. It may be the best package I received all holiday season. I laughed...I laughed some more...I learned, I enjoyed...I chuckled helplessly in the middle of the night keeping my husband awake. It was the kind of laughter you're not sure is coming and if it does...is it appropriate? Then...who cares? It's hilarious.I want to hang out and have cocktails with the main character and wait for some gems to just flow from his mouth.My used copy is not going to the Goodwill...I'm only giving it to people who will feel obligated to take my recommendations and make a full report on how right I am about this book after they've read it. Good Stuff!"
4,Witty and Entertaining!,"Laugh out loud funny mixed with touching insights about work life, home life and family. The felt as if it were truly written by an English professor. The non-stuffy, Dead Poets Society kind."
5,Fantastic read!,"Sophisticated wit, interesting and well-developed characters, and a great plot. I laughed out loud all the way through and read passages from the book out loud to my husband. I loved it!"
4,"Not as funny as ""The Risk Pool,"" but worth reading","Richard Russo's latest book deals with a college professor as he struggles the responsibilities of being the head a department where no one likes each other and the responsibilities of helping his adult daughter in her failing marriage. Russo accomplishes this with his usual flair for language and situations. I often laughed out loud, but not as much as with his previous books. I have loaned this book out to friends, and we all agree it's worth the time to read"
4,'The Straight Man' by Russo is Updike's 'Centaur' revisited.,"How is Hank Deveraux, Jr. not George Caldwell? Both are academics teaching in New England. Both have their counterpoint references: Caldwell's is the myth of Chiron, Deveraux his Occam's Razor. And, both men are consumed by conflicts generated from tenacious humor, perceived sexual opportunities, and their familial infrastructures. It works. Richard Russo has captured John Updike's voice from 'The Centaur' which I have missed and enjoyed revisiting. I know I will read Russo's other novels, and urge others to enjoy 'The Straight Man.'"
5,Meaning,"While my initial reason for reading the book was to enjoy some dark humor about the academy-my goal changed as I delved deeper into the text. I laughed out loud at many of the antics-and being an academic administrator I can attest to the reality of some of the most satirical moments. However, in the end I was very moved by the insights about the meaning of relationships. In fact, I had one of those brief moments of insight and clarity that make everything seem worthwhile."
2,Straight Man,"Not a terrible book, but whoever used the word ""uproarious"" in the review I read needs to look up the word in a dictionary."
2,No better the second time.,"I HAD to re-read this, to give my favorite author the benefit of the doubt. Alas ...There seems to be an obligatory urge of every author, whose day job is teaching at a university, to relate all those madcap highjinx perpetrated by the wild-and-crazy guys who inhabit acadamia. What comes glaringly across to readers is the recollection that their hopes for a college experience worthy of the name was trampled by the unimaginative, petty hacks who hold forth in the hallowed reaches of higher education. Read Jon Hassler's ""Rookery Blues"" for the same depressing jog of your hopefully-buried-forever memories. I didn't care a whit for any character in this book. And this from the man who could bring me to tears with ""Nobody's Fool"" and ""The Risk Pool"". Richard, I hope you've gotten it out of your system."
3,Maybe I read this in the wrong situation,"In part, because I'm the same age as William Henry Devereaux, Jr. Or perhaps because I read it in short snatches on the bus. But the book just didn't work for me. There were too many characters with too little value to them, and I frankly didn't have the concentration on the book to keep them straight.There's a scene in the book where he drives his injured daughter back to his house and there are some of his colleagues waiting for him. He essentially abandons his daughter to deal with the colleagues. I don't really care to learn about a character who might do that, let alone one who doesn't end up suffering for treating his daughter that way. Oh, great, he ends up getting Julie and Russell back together.The duck/goose thing was fun, the bits about real estate wars among college colleagues were interesting and poignant, but at the end, where he had all the male characters hanging out together, I felt like I didn't care about the fate of any of them."
2,Pathetically Unfunny,"As he lay dying, a famous old actor is reputed to have said ""Death is easy ... comedy is hard."" With this in mind, I should be kinder to Richard Russo whose new novel, STRAIGHT MAN is pathetically unfunny. The setting for the story is a college campus in Pennsylvania; its main character a smart-ass professor of English who is such a malcontent he belittles everyone he encounters with his juvenile pranks and witless remarks. I'd read that the book was laugh-out-loud funny. It is not. Irritating might be a better description"
3,If you read WONDER BOYS...,"...you've read this book. Only, you read it funnier. Still, the voice of the narrator is equisitely sharp and witty. I'd say, read until youre bored, then stop. It never changes."
2,Straight Man,"I like the way Richard Russo writes. However, I got tired of hearing all about the English Department. We read it for our Book Club and no one really enjoyed it."
5,A must read,"This was a book I read only reluctantly, as it was touted as ""funny"" and I generally react unfavorably to contemporary comedy. HOWEVER, once in my hands, I couldn't put this book down. Fast paced and engrossing, Straight Man is deliciously cynical, while somehow also managing to be humane. I found myself chuckling aloud on the train as a read it, much to the consternation of my fellow passengers. I highly recommend adding this to anyone's ""must read list""."
4,"A solid read--funny, insightful`","If you are familiar at all with college faculty or want to learn more about our professors when you were in college, this is a great book for you.Russo has a great command of the language of academia and I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occassion. Maybe it's just me, but the epilogue tied together too many of the loose ends. Sometimes I like novels to leave you hanging and yet Russo cleans up all of his messes (I suppose most people will appreciate this). It's almost like he offered that up for the paperback edition because too many people complained about unresolved issues. It was almost anti-climatic. But that is my only complaint on this fine read."
5,"One of the best books I've ever read, period.","Perhaps this book appealed to our family because we live in the bizarre world of academe. However, the writing was so exceptional that even those not familiar with the unique workings of academic politics will enjoy Straight Man. The two adults and 24-year old son in our family laughed until tears ran down our faces...then read the book again. Its strength is not just the exceptional humorous writing, but its ability to tap into human frailty and vulnerability, as well. I plan to read everything this man has ever written, and I wish he'd write more!"
4,Slow starter that picked up steam.,"I think Russo is one of the most talented living writers. This is my third Russo book in the last month and I just purchased two more. Straight Man took me a little while to warm up to, but once I did I couldn't put it down. It's about academics, so it's understandable that the characters are not supposed to be instantly likable and have to grow on you. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud...and that's rare."
4,Not Exactly a Page Turner...But Well Worth The Time,"This book took me forever to read, even though I totally enjoyed it through and through. Similar to Richard Ford's ""The Sportswriter"" and ""Independance Day"", the plot (what there is of one) is not really the point here; rather, it's the protaginist's ruminations on his life, his friends and collegues, his wife, his dog, and, to especially hilarious effect, his urinary track. I've enjoyed Russo's other books, but he is truly in top form on this one. The book is stunningly funny without being annoying or seeming like a one trick pony. The dialog is sharp and constantly entertaining, and the last sections concerning the main character's father and father-in-law are two of the funniest set pieces I've ever read. Now that I really think about it, maybe I read this one so slowly because every page and paragraph is meant to be savored."
4,"Witty, fast-paced and totally enjoyable","The book is totally fun! I purchased it without knowing much about it, other than being on a bookshelf of ""Staff recommendations"" in a book store. I'm a big reader of John Irving and Pat Conroy and find ""Straight Man"" easily compared to characters belonging to Conroy and Irving without all the whacked out and twisted plots, but still maintaining character depth and interest. Someone suggested this might not be a ""chick"" book.. but I'm one chick who has passed it along to other chick friends knowing they too will thoroughly enjoy reading ""Straight Man"". There seems to be only sadness and dysfunction on the Best Seller List these days - lighten up your subject matter for a change. You'll enjoy this one!"
3,A father thing,"There are two main reasons for having knocked off two stars from this book. First that for the second time, Risk Pool being first, I see the author again knocking on the door of the dificult emotions towards one father. Second star dropped out because it seems just too right for a man like him to come over all pending solutions to his life over a weekend. But all in all, pick it up and enjoy a funny story."
3,One sentence review,Russo may have written 'Straight Man' just to entertain himself; the reader's entertainment is a fortunate by-product.
2,You have to be a man to read this...,"I'm a 35 year old woman, not at all a feminist, but the women in this book are ALL sexist portrayals. Only Meg and Rachel seem to be real, the rest are bitc*y and/or skanky. He does nothing to shed a positive light onto women, and it has a very good ""men good, women bad"" light. Even by having one professor, a man, who is quite a feminist displays this obvious sexist attitude.With that being said, if you are a man or work in the education system, you may get some enjoyment out of it. For me, after 130 pages, I'm calling it a day."
3,"Writing, Good. Storyline, OK.","I'll keep this one short. The story is about a cynical man going through mid-life crisis. I'd have to say the target audience is probably the same. Since, I'm somewhat of a cynic myself, and since I was born in 65, you'd think this story is right up my alley. But, it was really just OK.I'm not disappointed in having read it, but I won't be passing it along to anyone. Is it funny? Not laugh out loud funny. But it the narrator pokes fun at everything, so you may chuckle some."
3,a difficult read,many in my book group found this book funny and charming but I found it difficult to appreciate and hard to get into
5,To the point.,"A wonderful, common sense defense and explanation of Catholic ceremonial practice.Shows how and why Catholics continue to worship the same way they have for 2000 years."
4,All terrain wheel barrow,I ended up having to buy another wheel as the one on my barrow (an older true temper) was a different size to the one that came with the product. Was a breeze to install and now I have no more wobbles or tipping when pushing a heavy load over rough terrain. Won't go back to one wheel ever again.
1,early fathers,The early Church Fathers did hold a high regard for the scriptures AND Sacred Tradition. Read the REST of what the Fathers had to say - especially regarding the Eucharist!
5,"Great for a rookie or the ""I think i know it all vet"".","SURVIVING STREET PATROL IS A GREAT BOOK. IT'S UP TO DATE, AN EASY READ AND FULL OF VALUABLE INFO THAT WILL KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES AND OUT OF A PINE BOX. I HAVE BEEN ON THE JOB FOR SIX YEARS AND, AFTER READING THIS BOOK,I REALIZED I HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLACENT. ACCORDING TO THE BOOK,MOST OFFICERS WHO ARE KILLED ON THE JOB HAVE FIVE PLUS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. DON'T LET IT BE YOU! BUY THIS BOOK AND REFRESH YOUR, ""I KNOW EVERYTHING"" MIND AND STAY SAFE."
5,TOP RATE,"These binoculars are first class and well worth the money. I have used them at NFL games and on vacations, recently in Glacier National Park.I like the way they are made, the ease with which they are adjusted, and the protective lens covers that fit over the end of lens and the view finder lens cap that is attached to the strap. You are less likely to lose the lens caps and view finder cap, as everything neatly attaches and fits in the carrying case.The view from short and long range distances is great, and for the price they are excellent.CSP"
1,Disappointing...buy something else,This is disappointing...a few of the remakes are ok. Some cuts are intolerably poor. The overal quality is poor and it is not as advertised.
3,Hits and misses,There are some outstanding cuts on this CD and some that just should have been left off. You might want to just download the ones you like after listening to the CD.
2,Not that good,"The cold play song is the only really good song on here. ""Dancing Shoes"" is horrible; the lyrics don't follow the beat. The Franz Ferdinand spanish cover is interesting."
3,I guess I should have read more carefully...,"This is a CD of non-Latin musicians playing their most Latin-inspired pieces in their own individual styles. If you are a fan of these bands, you might like it. But if you want authentic Latin rhythms and melodies, this is the wrong CD for you."
2,genre crash,"somethings just shouldn't be fused. The best songs in this album are the few songs recorded soley by the Buena Vista greats, which redeems the whole entire purchase."
2,Canned pseudo-latin music for gringos,This CD has remade and remixed versions of pop songs transformed into Afro-Cuban rythms. Not worth getting. There's plenty of good music out there to spend your bucks on this CD.
4,Very good music,I received the product pretty quickly. It is really nice. Some of the lyric's translations are not the best but the music is amazing!
3,Rhythms Del Mundo,"It's a good idea and not bad for the effort. The songs while some work very well ,the others were just a good try . I can see what they were trying to do. Anyway it's for a good purpose"
2,Where's the beef?,"I think it's pretty wimpy. There's no rock. Jazz-Pop fusion perhaps, but certainly not Jazz-Rock fusion. Jazz-Rock would imply that some element of rock exists. He should have gone back to the quarry."
2,Which group is this again?,"I can't quite remember correctly, but when I put on this cd a few days ago, I had to take it out of my cd player and look at it again, just to make sure that it said Larry Carlton on it. I believe when I pulled it out it did say Larry Carlton on it, but I would have just as much expected it to say Steely Dan on the front. This group has about as much their own sound as a dog its own apartment. And ""sounding"" like Steely Dan isn't as much a crime as ""recreating the sound of"" Steely Dan, which it seems that this group has done to a tee. I disagree with the notion that this music could make an old blues man cry. I do, however, believe that this cd could make Donald Fagen and Walter Becker cry, and then cause them to take litigative action against Larry Carlton for copyright infringement. I'm not saying this is horrible music, I like it, but I know it certainly should not be sold in the cd store under Larry Carlton."
5,The best album of Operacion Triunfo!,"This is one of their best albums, I bought it last week and I can't stop listening to both CDs. CD #2 has the best songs from gala #1-9, CD#1 has some of the songs from the gala that took place on December 22 to help the children of the world, so they can have a better future. I recommend this album to everyone and keep watching Operacion Triunfo 2 on TVE internacional (like I do)."
5,Very Good Cooler for the Price,"I really recommend to any one who owns a dual core processor. I have the E8600 processor at 4.0GHZ and the temperature at idle (Gaming) stays at 51-53c in the summer with room temperature of 86c. Its very easy to install. Just place the backplate to the motherboard, if you already have one dont remove it, most plates of the 775 processor coolers have the same screw dimension. All you have to do is just apply artic silver, find a screw driver, place the cooler on top of the processor and screw down the heatsink and voila. You are done."
5,Great quick review,Comprehensive overview of high yield facts for in-service and written board review.
2,Not a good print,"I am very surprised with Print quality of this book as I have been reading the same book which is own by my friend and I order this book because i have to return his book now.When i compare the two books, the one i got look like a photocopy rather than a proper print quality."
2,There's Better Books!,"Well - this review is obviously in the minority here! After having read the exciting and spellbinding ""The Saxon Tales"" by Bernard Cornwell, and the fantastic storytelling of Judson Roberts in ""The Strongbow Series"", I really expected (and wanted )to like this book. I didn't. I found the writing style excessively philosophical, the characters except for Skilgannnon, rather predictable, and overall was bored by the story and the writing style. Sorry guys."
3,Nothing New here... Same ol' same ol',"This book does not give any new depth to the character Druss, so all you Druss fans expect to meet an older Druss. On the other hand, meeting a new character like Skilgannon is somewhat interesting, but the use of demons in weapons is a bit tired, as was the 'joinings' threat, and Nadir shaman (one of the Khans) clones in other books.I'd wait for the trade to come out."
4,not bad,this book was pretty entertaining. the characters are very realistic and relatable. I felt the ended was rushed and somewhat unsettled. I guess that is why there is another book in the series. other than that I feel the ending could have been written differently. I enjoyed the book otherwise..
4,An excellent yarn,"This was my second book by David Gemmell. I gather that Druss has been the main character in his other books, but this one centers around Skilgannon, who seeks atonement for the atrocities he committed for his queen, whom he loves but can never have. A chance encounter with Druss, the legendary man, brings him in full circle to his past and an enemy he thought long-dead. A tightly packed adventure, and I hope this is beginning of a new series."
2,Squandered Potential,"After reading some glowing reviews of this album and band, I was also intrigued by the artwork and packaging after checking it out online, and decided to give it a shot. Very disappointing release....I don't really know how to express my displeasure in this review. They are seemingly competent musicians, they clearly have a grasp of what they wanted to do with this disc, and as previously stated, the art is interesting and well-done for an obscure indie release. It just comes across as extremely repetitive, lifeless, and plain old boring. I'm not sure what this is supposed to be....very uninspired and tedious instrumental prog-rock. Sorry guys, A for effort."
1,Pure garbage..less then a 1 star but they wouldn't let me go lower,"This is garbage. This ""author"" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys. It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it. Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever. Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book. as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"This book gives a very accurate insider's perspective on the illegal conduct that occured at smaller brokerage firms during the 1990's. It is both entertaining and very informative, especially when it details exactly how some of the stock manipulation scams were pulled off. It will certainly be an eye-opener for many investors, especially those who were conned into investing with these types of rogue brokers."
5,OUTRAGEOUS!!,"I met Louis in the 90's. He was one crazy kid with a gambling problem, his story is one of a kind, i read the book several times it is so good!! Best Wall Street Book Ever!"
3,More biography than non-fiction,"This book piqued my interest partly because it was unavailable for a while. However, it leans much more heavily toward a biography of the participants, particularly the main protagonist than toward a description of how the scams actually worked and similar aspects.That said, the book is well written and engaging, an easy, quick read that can be finished over the course of weekend."
3,It took about two chapters to loathe the main character...,"I would compare this book to sitting down with some crazy guy at a bar and listening to him ramble on for a few hours. The book had the feel of random musings by Louis Pasciuto. The author was either unable or unwilling to look to other sources in writing Pasciuto's story. You never hear from any of his victims. You never hear from any of the other people involved in these fraudulent schemes so the reader is left at the bar with only the word of Louis Pasciuto. Now the book did elicit some emotion from me as I learned about Louis. While some readers may be enamored or humored by this guy, he comes across to me as the worst type of thief and general bad guy. Definitely worth reading, but if you are looking for something more comprehensive and well researched, look for anything by James Stewart who is a MASTER at his craft."
1,masonry & concrete constuction revised,"I found this book to be very vague and not for the "" do it yourselfer"" SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,never be without a pick on stage,I love these pick holders. They're easy to get on and off. They hold a nice amount of picks. And you get that rock-star feel (throw picks at the audience). A must for any gigging guitarist.
3,Interesting but Made for Hollywood?,"Some interesting insights into congressional happenings as far as lobby influence and ""staff/page"" influence. I found the characters fairly realistic; but the chases and skirmishes were totally unrealistic. Result: The action became science fiction.As long as one likes fast paced, unbelievable action tales, one should enjoy this."
2,Wait for paperback,"Don't go by the book jacket when selecting this book. For whatever reasons, the description on the jacket doesn't match the book.The plot was intriguing, however it never built up steam for the climax.I'd wait for paperback."
2,His worst novel to date,"This novel was highly disappointing. For starters, the story described on the jacket is not at all the one told in the book. Had the jacket described the true story, I likely would have skipped the novel. I have read and loved every B. Meltzer novel to date. I am a huge fan who spent many months anticipating what turned out to be the bore of 2004. The plot was unrealistic and boring. The fight scenes were highly unbelievable especially since a former world class fighter kept getting his butt kicked by amateurs. It would be unfair to those who have yet to read the book for me to go into detail about my many objections. Suffice it to say it left a lot to be desired."
2,Half-baked plot,"What do you get with a half-baked plot, multiple chase scenes with miraculous last-second escapes, fight scenes with the weak guy/girl somehow surviving, and unlikely characters who are not especially compelling? A book that doesn't deliver. The behind-the-scenes Congressional staffer/lobbyist interaction was of some interest, but it too was sketchy and unrealistic. Perhaps the author has some better books sitting out there."
3,The believability game,"The first 66 pages of this novel are told in the first person by the chracter Matthew Mercer who ends up describing his own death. Which is, of course, impossible. This sort of thing has been used by other authors but always with bad effect. The need in a story such is this is to suspend belief but Meltzer immediatly violates that rule. The reader is left with the feeling he's been suckered and begins looking for other faults in the story. Meltzer happily supplies them: a thug incapable of feeling pain, a 17-year old girl with the maturity of a saint and an implausable plot to transmutate elements. There is no question that Meltzer can create cliff-hanging situations but if he had only had the sense to use a third-person voice at the beginning of his book, the reader wouldn't have spent so much time looking for other improbabilities."
1,Boring!,"Even for this genre, this book was totally implausible. The villian was an invulnerable mindreader until, of course, the ""final battle."" There were basic questions that any of the characters would have asked before proceeding, but, did not -- because that would have been the end of the book. Similarly, the rationale for not going to any authorities for assistance did not hold water.Moreover, the dialogue was stilted, preachy and talky. The ""action"" sequences were excruciatingly long and pointless.Finally, I listened to this book on tape and the reader was overwhelmingly underwhelming."
5,AMAZING,this is my favorite book. i was a page in the u.s. house and meltzer's descriptions of the capitol and surrounding areas is astounding. i don't think i'm at all biased about this book because of my experience. i honestly feel like this really is the best book out there. i've never been that entrenched in a book...not even harry potter!
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"This is Mr. Meltzer's fifth book, and I've read them all. He writes interesting stories with twists and turns that keep my interest.He tends to write about Wall Street or Washington DC. This particular story is set primarily on Capitol Hill. It's the story of Matthew and Harris, young but seasoned congressional staffers, who play a mysterious betting game to keep life interesting (as if working in DC isn't interesting enough). There's a bit of risk, reward and lots of status to know that you've been invited to play in the ""Game"".When one bet gets out of hand and people start dieing, they realize they've stumbled on to something more sinister than imaginable...and that the bad guy will stop at nothing until they're no longer a problem. A young Senate page, who originally agreed to run a simple errand, gets entangled in the mess as well.It was hard to put this book down, but I have to admit: the climax was a bit of a stretch. What else is new in Washington?"
2,fast start...slow finish,"was really excited about a new meltzer book!! the description on the back sounded great...started it, and yes, a ""political intrigue"" novel. then...what started as a really interesting idea soon turned into a ""spy kids"" chase. zero game...how about zero character development. totally lost me when the two characters hop a private jet and head off to a mine in south dakota...really disappointing..."
4,4 1/2 stars,"I, for one, thought this was one of Meltzer's best. Fiction with a high entertainment value.Along with a good look at the workings of the political machine, it provided a suspenseful plot that moved very fast. A very enjoyable getaway.Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing,I've enjoyed Brad Melzer in the past and the plot in The Zero Game seemed interesting so I had great expectations. Unfortunately the book was very much a disappointment. I gave it a two star rating because if nothing else I thought it was funny. I don't think Melzer intended his novel to be a comedy but to me it read like one. I had the feeling that I was reading a spoof of a political thriller. The plot quickly gave way to one chase scene and narrow escape after another with the bad guy always knowing exactly where the good guys would go next. I wish writers would spend more time developing the story rather than simply writing chase scene after chase scene.
3,My First Meltzer Read,"What a ride! Nothing that I expected. Meltzer has done a lot of research to come up with a great read in The Zero Game. I even learned something as well as was entertained. Good job Meltzer.If you're looking for a different and exciting novel, read LUST OF THE FLESH by Beverly Rolyat. A story about district attorney, Nick Allapapalaus, who finds himself caught up in a web of lust, deceit, mystery, suspense, betrayal, murder and sex galore. Is he really the biological father of his ex-wife's promiscuous teenage daughter's infant son? Or has he been set up? A compelling, riveting, engaging, pageturning novel. Enjoy!"
1,into the Toilet,"Brad must have some young chldren. The first two chapter use ""potty "" humor add infinitum. He also overdoes the kid book analogies. It is so tiresome and booring that you do not have patience for the rest of the story.From the first page, you just want to throw away the book. Don't wast your timne or money. Read anything else"
2,the zero game,"poorly written, little plot, awful. kept reading hoping it would get better. such was not the case. finally gave up.The Zero Gamenever again"
2,Below Expectations,"To be fair, I stopped reading halfway through. First, this guy is writing the same book over and over. In this version there is way too much meaningless chatter between the characters and some of the situations drag on and on and on. There is so much good literature out there, I can't recommend wasting your time with this one."
3,Average Book,"This book was only average. The plot was alright and the story was interesting enough, it was just hard for it to keep my attention. I would recommend a great book from this author, The Millionaires. That book was hard to put down."
4,"Another fast, thrilling read","I'm a fan of Brad Metzler, and I enjoyed this fast read. If you enjoy mystery thrillers, this book is up your alley."
5,great open. ok close.,starts off strong...very strong. fades in the middle and then the close comes back a little bit. do not think that the villian aspect was sold completely. overall a solid read...
2,The tension level wore me out!,"The Zero Game is fair in my mind. It's full of mystery and intrigue set in Washington, DC amid the political world. Harris and Viv are very complex yet likeable characters. Yet I constantly found myself rereading in order to follow what was happening. It's full of action and I had trouble keeping track of who threw the punches and where they landed. Maybe that's just me wanting a story that was more subdued. The tension stayed at a fever pitch through the entire 400 plus pages. Stories with that much pressure wear me out. I try not to let my own personal preferences skew my reviews but it's not always possible. Brad Meltzer is a highly successful author, but his writing just doesn't appeal to me.Linda C. WrightAuthorOne Clown Short"
3,Could have been better,"The story is far fetched but I could look past that if not for the writing style. The best books to me are the ones that involve you in the story, the ones that pull you in and make you feel like you're a part of the events as they happen. This isn't that kind of book. Instead of being along for the ride, I feel like I'm sitting in a bar having the main character tell me a story of what happened to him last week. If you can find a cheap copy, maybe used, you might pick this up. It's not worth it at full price."
2,A definite eye roller,"After starting off on a high note, The Zero Game quickly falls into the same plot structure as DaVinci code, ie. Find a clue...run, run, run...find a clue...run, run, run...on and on for five hundred pages or so. I did find some of the Washington ""insider"" stuff to be interesting, so kudos to Meltzer for his extensive research. But as far as the story goes, I wasn't buying it for a second. Unfortunately the entire plot hinges on a character who is supposed to be brilliant acting like an idiot throughout. At no point was I convinced that the protagonist couldn't simply call the authorities and then hide out until the whole matter was resolved. And the villains are so ridiculous and one-dimensional it's not even funny. You've seen these guys a million times. Based on the research that went into this book, I wouldn't write Meltzer off, but he definitely needs to dedicate more of his time to crafting a compelling story with believable characters."
1,Zero Game,"Either the person who wrote the description on the book jacket did not read the book, or if Brad Meltzer wrote it, he forgot that he killed off his main character early on. The description includes the dead character as one who is still alive and ""in a frenetic chase from the secret tunnels under the Captiol to an abandoned gold mine halfway across the country, the TWO friends ...on the run, THEY turn to...the only person they can trust: 16-yr.-old..."" AMAZING! The one character is dead BEFORE any of this happens! This was the beginning of many disappointments and confusion for me. If this had been the first Brad Meltzer book I had read, I would never choose his books again."
3,"Good, but long winded...","This is a good book. The problem is simply that it's too long winded. There are passages of action that should be describable in a couple pages, but drag on across 20. This is meant, I assume, to build suspense, but the net result is that high-intensity action becomes a little boring.Overall, the book is quite good and entertaining... not so much a political thriiller as it merely uses the guise of politics as an introduction to the novel rather than for the plotline. My only other complaint is that it left me with one unanswered question -- unfortunately, that question pertains to an event that happens that starts the roller coaster ride of a story. Without an answer as to why things were done they way they were (I don't want to give away anything), I'm left not understanding why there was ever a story to begin with."
3,Not even in your dreams - but fun to read,"I was turned off by Metzler in the first book I read of his,The First Counsel. I then read later efforts and adjusted my thinking. This book is fine as long as you suspend belief in the ultimate objective, i.e. believing the plot. However, there is a lot of insight in this book in to the working of the legislative side of the government which is instructive and interesting...and as I have said...if you buy into the plot that he sets, the rest is easy. I did have a problem with how he told this story. In the first person for two of the characters, one of whom is murdered, and then back to the third person. Maybe it works for others...it didn't for me. However this is NOT a bad book. It is just a bit different and if you like the author...go for it."
3,"Needs more thought, less action","I really like Brad Meltzer's work and was excited to pick up Zero Game. But I'm disappointed: the whole book reads like the script to the movie he hopes to sell. Way to much violence--and in bone-crunching, gravel-slicing-into-face-as-person-slides-head-first-into-ground detail. Too much running around, not enough mindplay.As usual, he's a great researcher, characters are likeable, and he paints a good picture. I'm still a fan, but I'll skip the movie."
3,Mediocre thriller,"On the good side, Zero Game DOES have a lot of action, and decent characterization. The problem is that the plot is so far-fetched that it's really hard to get into this story. It borders on ridiculous. I got the impression the author had a pretty good idea for a book, then was determined to carry it out even when it didn't work. I did finish the book, but it was certainly not Mr. Meltzer's best effort. For those who feel driven to read every one of his books, you'll make it through this winding road of absurdity, but at the end you'll ask yourself whether it was worth the ride."
2,Not his best.,"Just finished ""The Zero Game"" and John Grisham's ""The Pelican Brief"" kept popping up in my mind. Not to say that this book is a retread but once you finish, you have a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel. I couldn't really invest in the story as the character development was pretty sparse (along with the jacket summary being wrong!!!). And is Mr. Meltzer trying to redeem the bad guy at the end??!! Wait on this one...it will hit the remainder bins."
5,"Fantastic Thriller, A Fun Read!","No summary of the book here, if you want that, look at one of the other reviews.This is the first Brad Meltzer book I have read. I could not put the book down...finished the 460 pages in two days. If you are a fan of John Grisham type thrillers, you will enjoy this book. I will be waiting for the movie to come out and reading some of Meltzer's other works."
3,"Easy to read, informative albeit implausible","If you want a sneak peek into the life & work of Capitol Hill staffers and lobbyists, this is an excellent book. It is also a fast read and enjoyable thus making up for the implausibility of the story (one undestands poetic license but there are limits). This is not a sophisticated novel but it is still pleasant to read."
2,Nothing to write home about...,"I bought this book thinking it sounded interesting, and since I'd heard quite a bit about the author but hadn't read anything of his yet, I gave it a whirl. I was extremely disappointed about a quarter of the way through the book, and from there, it only got worse. Meltzer is a gifted writer, I believe, but not gifted enough to break as many conventions of fiction writing as he does with disturbing frequency. I had to grit my teeth to read past the halfway point, and am genuinely surprised at how many positive reviews this novel has received. It's not the worst I've read, but I have to say I expected more. If you can smell bad writing from more than a mile away, look somewhere else. This novel was a page-turner in the sense that I read on only to see if it would improve. It didn't."
2,Meltzer's First Failure,"(Beware: plot disclosure). Brad Meltzer is obviously a very smart guy, a former lawyer-turned writer. His books have that ""insider"" flare that really grabs the reader, at least in his first books. But now he's managed to commit a cardinal sin of novelists: killing off his narrator. In addition, THE ZERO GAME is little more than one big chase sequence, in and out of Washington. He gives very brief glimpses of Congress, and they're fun, but unfortunately they are not enough to sustain the novel. I'll look forward eagerly to Brad Meltzer's next novel, but sadly, this one just doesn't work."
4,"Good (Great if you like long, long chase scenes)","I agree with the reader review that says that Meltzer has good story ideas and sloppy execution. This book, though, was very satsifying and has a great twist very early on (once you get there, you'll know). I loved the early twist as well a later twist, but a lot of it in between is filled with chase scenes and 'what is going on' moments. Meltzer likes to rely on funny characters (like in The Millionaires) but chooses many unrealistic scenes where the main characters should be dead (especially if being chased by a killing machine. I liked this book, though, even with its flaws and felt I learned things about the government (even if some of it is pretty hardcore fiction). To those who are sceptical about what really goes on behind the doors in D.C., I think that anything is possible."
1,Not Worthy of Meltzer,I have really enjoyed other books by this author but this is beyond stupid! One chase after another described in detail for pages at a time. The plot could have been covered in one chapter. It goes on and on with little in the way of interesting detail. The worst read I have had in years!
1,Whatta Waste,"I agree with reviewer Estee Beck. Meltzer never once grabsthe reader's attention and it seems like the author hasveered away from his past novels and is now aiming for ayounger generation, therefore, the inane dialouge betweenHarris and Viv. I never once caught on to what the gamewas about, not till the very end, by which time I wasexhausted by the lengthy chase sequences. I found it highlyimplausible how everything falls into place for the victimsof the chase. Is it that easy to get a private jet totake you from D.C. to S.D., at no cost, plus have a carwaiting for you on your arrival?"
2,Zero it out,Meltzer lastest effort leaves you yearning for more. The plot does not have his usual level of development. The main characters in this book are uninteresting and the overall story is convoluted. I would recommend bypassing this book and latch onto some of his earlier works.
3,"An Alternative Universe, Hurrah!","Harry Harrison has never been one of my favourite authors, and this book certainly did not change my opinion. But I have to admit, alternative histories have always been my weak spot and in ""a Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah"" Harrison succeeds pretty well in combining an intriguing victorian setting and and an interesting plot with the enormous engineering project required by the tunnel between England and its North-American colony, USA. As in Harrison's popular science fiction parodies, this book also has a fluent storyline and although it didn't quite catch the level of sense of wonder I expected, at least it managed to keep away the boredom of our mundane world. And isn't that way most of us read science fiction anyway?"
4,When Cords Are Needed...,"In a world where wireless game controllers are common, this is still a good product. Gamers like myself, still play on older consoles, and get much enjoyment from that. And when you have older consoles, cords are needed. This product makes it easier for myself to sit and play my Game Cube games from my couch without having to move the console, and stretch the power cord. The product works and I found it cheap. Not much more, I can say about that."
2,Disappointing,"This book is great if you want to get an overall sense of what makes certain pieces of furniture valuable. But in terms of details, fuhgeddabodit. There are no close up shots of anything. The pictures are all B&W and of poor quality. I bought this because I wanted to see details of Federal furniture. What did the inlays look like? What kind of wood was used? The book doesn't even attempt to look at such details. So, ""Fine Points of American Furniture"" is a rather misleading title. The title should have been, ""In the Macro Sense, Why Certain Pieces of American Furniture are Valuable From a Design Perspective: A Collection of Poor Quality Photos."""
1,Product I never received,"I ordered this book 10/15/08, and was told it would be delivered between 10/23 and 11/7/08. It is now Nov.18, 2008 and I have yet to receive my purchase. On Nov. 13, 2008 I e-mailed booksong29 and have never received a responce even though I paid for this purchase on Oct. 15th. Where do we go from here?"
4,civilizacion y cultura,This book is very well organized. Each chapter progresses chronologically under each sub-category. Each capter also includes a timeline in the beginning and questions at the end.
2,Convoluted and confusing,I bought this book because it was required reading for a class. The text is written in such a way as to be unclear and and very unweildy for third year Spanish students. The vocabulary was very advanced and I found it more helpful to read about the history of Spain on the internet or in the encyclopedia for an overview before thinking about attempting this book. This is not a book that I would strongly recommend to an intermediate student.
1,confusing,I have been reading this book and think the format is awful. He skips around time periods and has details of one thing and then nothing on another. There is no visual aid for where the people came from and occupied Spain. There also is no outline or good intro for the book.
2,Civilizaci√≥n y cultura de Espa√±a,"First, I paid extra money to have the book deliver quickly, however, I received the book five days later. A friend of mine didn't paid for fast delivery but she got the book 3 days later. I was really disappointed because amazon has always been reliable. SO I paid extra money for nothing.The author of the book is not impartial, he presents the facts according to his view, for him it looks like Franco did nothing wrong!!"
5,Always needed,You know when you need it you never have it so now with it being on a key chain you've always got it.
5,it's great to get the music I love so easy and quickly. Great price too!,it took me forever to find this album. I remember Luther before he became famous and I love the quality of his voice
5,Just what I needed,I needed a binder for my cookbook - one that would work for sheet protectors and oversized indexes to work with the sheet protectors. This was just the thing. Works great! Good quality!
4,"Great as far as it goes, but you'll probably need more.","With the other three Premium Editions (covering exams 70-210, 70-215, and 70-217), once you master the material they present, you've got a pretty good chance of passing the exam. If you rely on this one as your only resource, you may be in for a rude awakening when you take that exam! The exam goes into several subjects, in particular routing, and certificate services, in much more detail than is covered in this book. Still, there's a great deal of relevent information here, enough to make it well worth the price. Combine this with a couple other resources, though."
3,A Bit of Everything,"This is an album that contains some of the bands best known songs and some of their lesser known songs so therefore I suppose it is a ""Collection"" of sorts. It is certainly a mish/mash of their songs so will please some but maybe not all but is a break from the traditional ""Greatest Hits or Best Of"" as you get a good mixture of their overall work. If you want a true ""Collection"" it just aint out there. Hopefully somewhere down the track someone will sit down and compile a true Dr Hook Collection (which will take a double album) and contain all their true hits, some misses and some rareities like ""Wild Colonial Boy""; ""Daddy's Little Girl""; ""Red Winged Blackbird"" .....and so on and so on but until then if you want their best of stick with ""Hits & History"" or ""The Singles"" and supplement your appetite with this album for some of their lesser known songs."
5,Emmylou Collector,"I am putting together a collection of Emmylou's life work and with the sellection and prices on Amazon makes for fast work. I love late '70s alternate-country and Emmylou Harris is an icon. Her recordings are always great, great songs and musicians."
5,Haunting,I first purchased this Album in vinyl and it is well worth having it in CD. A beutiful album taking full advantage of Emmylou's voice
3,memorex karaoke machine MKS 8506,"I purchased two of these from Target last Christmas. One of them never worked..The other wokred fine for a while but now the microphone doesn't work. I think target has quit carrying them, because I cannot find them there. What a bummer. I spent a fair amount of money for nothing, and no way to get them fixed.Hopefully Memorex will stand behind their product."
3,"Good performanes, but they don't make you want to dance","Masur recorded the 21 Hungarian Dances in 1981, years before he helped lead the revolt against the E. German Communist party or came West to head the NY Phil. in what turned out to be a dreary tenure. The performances are good enough, with nice ensemble and forward recording of the woodwinds. However, there's not much bounce in Masur's step, and unlike the set conducted by Mogrelia on a super-budget CD with a Cassovia ensemble I've never heard of, Masur didn't make me want to dance. Go for big-time conductors like Abbado and Karajan if you want virtuosic rendiitons, Mogrelia if you want a spring in your step."
2,Bait & Switch ?,"It was always a surprise to pop this disc in the player, only to get a pedestrian tour of the dances, not the rousing performance I heard in Leipzig before Masur skipped town. Er, emigrated.Now that I have started loading discs onto my server for the iPods and entertainment centres, I have learned a possible reason why: the imprinted label on my disc may say Masur and the Gewandhaus, but the embedded titles say the album was recorded by Irwin Fischer with the Budapest Festival Orchestra in 1983.I don't want to denigrate Fischer or the Budapest, but their standards have not always been of the highest calibre. Some of their recordings are more suited to shopping centre audio systems than to good home entertainment systems and serious listening. And of course Philips is not at the top of the heap for accurate CD production."
4,"Bought for a class, but pretty interesting","I bought this book for a class, but it's pretty interesting anyway. The Catholic viewpoints in here are a bit... unrepresentative, though. The Jewish viewpoints were very enlightening."
4,The grooviest cd this year!,"This CD features artists like: SClub7, Sonique, Stephen Gately, Steps and lots,lots more. This double CD has all the songs that are in the UK charts at the moment and will no doubt go down a storm. I recommend this to anyone and even if you have to get it export so it is more exspensive it's worth it. Everyone buy this CD!"
3,A departure from the first two,"This is a fine C.D., it`s a a real departure from ""Art of tea"" and""Sleeping Gypsy"". I own every C.D. by Micheal Franks,none are bad, this one`s a bit more mellow, but the title track is the best.. Stephen C.Burgiel"
4,Burchfield Nines,"I am a rather dedicated fan of Mr. Franks' music, having been introduced to ""Popsicle Toes"" on a road trip through Canada in 1976, and collecting all of his music since then. I listen to him on a daily basis. His quirky lyrics, off-beat phrasing and jazzy delivery never grow old for me. Burchfield Nines does not disappoint. It is not one of his strongest recordings, but it is consistently Michael Franks and, like the rest of his catalogue, it will be listened to and enjoyed over and over."
2,"Easy read, but not all that interesting","This book is exactly as advertised - Greta's opinions on a variety of issues. While I may agree with her on a lot of issues, I'm not sure why I should care.I learned a little about tort reform, was creeped out by her section on the death penalty and found the CNN slams a little annoying by the end.Overall, this was an easy read but not all that interesting."
1,Her Heart Was Definitely Not In it,"Greta's book is disappointing & inconsistent She seems afraid to take a stand on most issues, yet she does gently lean toward the left on others, suggesting that she is a ""closet right winger"". She says that she approves of the death penalty after a fair trial yet contradicts herself by saying that we have no right to kill another person despite the severity of their crimes. Greta appears to be at a psychological crossroads. She either doesn't know quite what she believes or she is trying to cater to everyone by being ""middle of the road"". She seems lost in the realm of controversy. Issues like current events and the law would have made for better reading, but her ideas on these lean toward the left (as seen on her show), and this would contradict her negative feelings about labels. With more passion, relevant topics and clarity, the book would have really soared."
3,Sure thing..,Sure It's good! That's for sure but I must say that they can do better than that! This album was better than the first but I think the first album were much more heavy than this. The texts are better than the first but still not good enough. I know they can do better! The best songs on the album must be Keep on movin' and Two sides of the story. The reasons why I think that is that it's more than just party and lovestorys to the texts. And that's what I rate is good. Because people get tired of listening to the same old stories. The album was good but the next one will be better!
1,Not a good followup,"I only liked one song ""Serious."" The rest of the album is just complete album filler to me. The absence of Max Martin on this album is painfully obvious here. Not that Max should be the main one for them, but he was a major part of their edgy debut from 1998. The other producers and writers for this one created songs that seem unfocused, uneven, and sometimes forgettable songs here. There not a lot of the funk that dominated the debut. And rival groups Backstreet Boys and NSYNC put out better albums than this limp album. While I give Five effort, this album just failed to excite me in 2000 the way that their '98 debut did."
4,Almost but not quite,"I loved five's first album and this ablum was good but not as good as the first. I liked every song on the last album yet on INVINCIBLE there are some song that i just skip, I love five and always will but you can't have a great Cd everytime. Can you?"
1,THE CLONE OF THE CLONE!!!!!,"UNBELIAVABLE!!!When you think the only backtreet boy clone was nsync...comes Five, a clone of the clone...This is completely terrible, i mean, the five menbers even know each other before the music company create the band five...THIS IS A PRODUCT... they even wrote the songs...It's all total embarassing...it's kinda embarassing listen to this...go listen to michael jackson or madona, it's way way better...."
5,David White 26x auto level,"I recently purchased this level to replace a broken nikon ax-1which sells for the exact same price as the David White package. Tocompare these two levels is like comparing night to day, with this one being the hands down favorite! The viewfinder on top is great and the overall ""feel"" of the controls and the movement is by far better than the competitor. I also found it much easier to level up, and like the fact that it is a little heavier than the other, feels sturdier on the tripod. This is a great level for the price! And I was also really pleased with the aluminum adjustable stick that came with it!"
2,"A Little English, Please!","I have had this item about 12 hours now. It is my very first experience with this type of product. It is cute as can be, but very confusing. The guide is very poorly translated, (read practically indecipherable), and suggests that I look on the website for clarification. There doesn't seem to be a website. The one I found has no manual, and is just a retailer. I had little trouble adding music or photos, and the sound and picture quality are fine, but it won't play the photos once I get them in there, and, with only one tiny joystick to control all functions, it is very difficult to figure out. It warns you to read the book first. I wish I could.A search of the net found me only other folks asking for help learning to work the little dear. Next time I will spend a little more time, avoid the hype of the closeout bins, and get the genuine article."
2,Don't give this to kids,I gave this necklace to my ex's kid and he snapped the cross in less than a minute. So I do not recommend this necklace to any childern under 10 years old. Other than the pendant the cord necklace is easy to clean and doesn't break as easily as the pendant (unless cut by a knife or scissors).
