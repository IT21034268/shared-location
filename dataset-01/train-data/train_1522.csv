3,Retirees with fond memories of Europe will love it...,"Nice locales. Slow action. Mid 1800-s Upper Class life in the Austrian (Austro-Hungarian) Empire. Girl (Sissi) is supposed to attend young emperor Franz Joseph's engagement but ends up meeting him prior to the event. It's not hard to guess the rest.Karlheinz BÃ¶hm (who plays the emperor) played the protagonist in Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" a few years later. Perfect choice after playing in a 10-hour romance movie. Romy Schneider (Sissi) disliked her role very much.Hungarians loved Sissi. She favored them over Austrians at her court. One of the main bridges over the Danube in the Hungarian capital is named in her honor."
5,At long last....,"At long last the Sissy collection is available in the USA. Beautiful sets and costumes make the film enjoyable in any language. The true history of Empress Elizabeth may be twisted, but they are beautiful films. Watch the English dubed Sissy; My Love Forever and then watch the un-dubed version. That will make watching the foren language films in the collection a lot easier to follow the plot."
2,Do yourself a favor and spend $$$,"This cleaner is fine for really small areas that need cleaning - absolutely useless on bigger areas!!! Doesn't clean very well and leaves alot of water in the carpet, even after going over it tons of times! Left my carpet streaked with uneven cleaned areas and dirty areas. Also found the dirty water recepticle defective - sometimes it would pick up the water and sometimes it would not. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and purchase a better quality product - don't waste your money!!!"
2,Not what I expected.,The Circle Flow was cheaply made and not what I expected it to be. It was not easy to handle and not very pliable. The CD was ho-hum at best
5,Wonderful workout for traveling women,This is a good core workout - I take my ring when I travel for work; with this DVD and my computer...I'm good to go!
5,Small hands I've got!,"I do have very small hands and I have always found the stock mouse to be too large and too heavy. This is also a problem for precision as I am a computer animator and a mouse that is too heavy is also too slow to keep up with my work. This mouse is so light and so small that it keeps up and doesn't weigh me down. Since my first version of this mouse I have gotten two more computers and each time I have again ordered this mouse for my new system, I've tried others but none compare. Light and small!"
4,Sweet....Maintains the Character of Pooh As You Learn,"As a home-schooler, I depend on my materials to include all the important aspects of the subjects taught while keeping the student interested. Pooh's Learning Library does this with the help of the gentle, sweet Pooh characters. This workbook progresses through the lessons in continuing stories that maintain the personalities of the characters and their familiar relationships perfectly. Each activity is labeled for concepts taught which is extremely helpful to the parent and there are resource guides in each section as well. The graphics are lush and very well rendered. A generous book with 192 pages of fun and reward stickers your child will easily understand what is expected of him due to the logical way the activity is laid out. With glue, scissors, and pencil at the ready, you'll have everything you need in a Pre-K workbook to teach reading, math, language, writing, and fine motor skills. We can't wait to get the next book in the series!"
4,Excellent series,"I have just become a Family Guy fan and it's just awesome.Obviously not all the episodes are equally funny, but in general it's a pretty good show that you shouldn't pass by....Stewie and Brian rock!!!!!"
5,Family guys is one of the best shows on tv!,"Family guys is simply one of the best shows on TV. Grab a friend, a beer, and a few hours and try not to laugh your butt off!!"
5,Awesome but a warning for the hardcore fan,"All the episodes of season 3 are absolutely fantastic. But why wouldn't they be, family guy is the greatest animated show in history. I'm just writing this to warn the hardcore fan. Fox cut out scenes in the first volume and they may again. For instance, the osama bin laden scene and the JFK pez dispenser scenes were cut entirely from volume 1 so hopefully there part of the deleted scenes on volume 2. In other words the episodes may not be truly full. Also, Seth McFarlane the other day announced that family guy is very close to a comeback and a movie is in the works so live on family guy!"
1,"Great Show, Ridiculous Price!","This show will likely rerun on FX, cable has proved a show doesn't need 5 seasons to get syndicated. $... for three failed seasons, are you kidding me.Heed my advice, spend half the money and purchase 3 seasons of Sports Night; six discs, one collection, chances are you never caught it while on ABC.Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Family Guy, it's underrated ,unlike the Simpsons, which by all accounts hasn't been good since Maggie ""killed"" (shot) Mr. Burns.I will say, Family Guy is so much better minus the comercials, and somehow its funnier on my PC than I remember being on my TV."
5,EXCELLENT EPISODE.,"One of the best episodes, especially because of Brian getting hammered after seeing what he did to Peter. Oh, hey Amazon. He bid 100 Million on the vase, not 10 Million."
1,2 discs short,"i ordered this and received 1 disc. i sent it back and was sent one disc again ... i want a refund .... this is ridiculous!:::::UPDATE:::::i sent the disk back a week or so ago and asked for a refund, i got an e-mail tonight that said that since they had exchanged the order they would not be giving me a refund ..... i really hope that this is some sort of mistake that gets sorted out .... i've never had a problem with amazon before but this may be the last time i order from them.:::::NEW UPDATE:::::it was a mistake and i was given a refund!!"
1,UPSET,"when I ordered this dvd set I thought it was NEW, when I got it, it was USED and in poor condition, not very happy!"
5,Simpsons who? Family Guy Rocks!,"if figured if you are looking at the 3rd season you've seen the show so i won't talk about the storyline of the show. this disc set is so much better than season 1 & 2. i had thought Family Guy could get any funnier, but i was wrong. BUY THE [...]DISC SET!!!"
5,This is going to be great!,I just recently bought the 1st volume of The Family Guy on Labor Day weekend. The show is awesome!!! I can't believe I misses out on this show when it was on Fox! I will for sure get this DVD set to add to my collection! I also recommend the first volume to people--go buy it now! :-)
5,Best Comical DVD Ever!!!,"This DVD is just amazing. The menu system is great, and easy to use. Each and every episode has a commentary. And the un-aired ""Wish upon a Weinstein"" is hilarious. A great gift idea for any fan, or just a great gift to give to yourself."
5,Best freakin' show on TV,"This show is freakin sweet! All I want to share with you are some quotes from my favorite episodes.It is Peter's b-day.Lois: Look, Peter! Stewie wrote you a card. 'Happy birthday,Daddy. Love, Stewie'(Stewie grabs card)Stewie: What the...? Did you...did you...FORGE MY NAME? Is that...backward S supposed to be cute? Why, I'm crapping doublefor YOU tonight!Another great moment is when Peter gets liposuction.Peter walks in is door, muscular and thin, after getting liposuction.Brian: Hey, you can't just walk in here...holy crap it's Peter!The family is in court, and Peter has been sentenced to 3 yrs. in prison.Lois: Oh, no!Meg: Oh, no!Crowd: Oh, no!(bursting through wall)Kool-Aid man: OH,YEAH!!(slowly backs away through rubble)These are just some of the few great moments in Family Guy history, but boy are they FREAKIN' SWEET![thank you]"
5,Seth Mcfarlane should do a Pixar movie!,"Seth who provides most of the voices for the show should be utilized more for his vocals talents. Pixar, who's great at using vocal talents should give him a look. By the way, these DVD are brilliant. Fox really screwed up."
1,Don't order this set from Amazon - they can't seem to deliver correctly,"For some reason Amazon can't seem to ship this series correctly. Twice now they've only shipped me one disc (vs. the three that are supposed to be in the series). It wasn't even shrink-wrapped... very bizarre. And it was shipped from Amazon (not a Zshop, etc.) along with a brand-new CD that arrived fine. Really disappointed."
1,Overrated,"Brian is the only character that doesn't make me want to rip all of my hair out. Stewie used to be my favorite character, but he's not as evil anymore. I nearly died when I saw him try to comfort Peter at that sporting event. Disgusting.This show does better without recurring themes, like when Peter's boss dies and he's a fisherman. AWFUL. We have to put up with that idiocy for the rest of the season.Family Guy was absolutely hilarious the first 2 seasons, but it ran out of steam very quickly. But, how long can you outright copy other shows (King of the Hill, The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, etc.) and still be funny?"
2,The Show Was Cancelled. . .,". . .because it was a poor excuse for comedy. Unlike others, I felt there was very little redeeming value to Family Guy. I can sit through an entire episode and not have the urge to laugh -- not even once. And that speaks very poorly for the quality of said show. The writers seemingly tried too hard to be irreverent, and the product they produced could easily be equated with what the family dog, Brian, left on the rug. Often the writers would resort to jokes about rabbis which not only bordered on antisemitic but were so unfunny one would have to wonder whether they were purposely trying to write crap. If you're looking for a crude, irreverent, yet funny animated comedy turn to South Park. Or, better yet, skip directly to the most creative, well written and produced animated comedies since The Simpsons, Futurama and King of the Hill. Remember, you can easily tune to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim if you're craving the dismal, dubious comedy of Family Guy."
5,The Funniest Show Ever!!!,"Many shows have their moments, but this is the first show I've ever laughed OUT LOUD, multiple times in one episode. The humor is so creative and edgy and amazingly timed. I will say that you do need to be around my age (I'm 40) to get alot of the inside jokes, but if you do their hilarious. And if you don't there's still plenty to make you laugh. I would HIGHLY recommend all three Volumes that are out now."
5,Best show ever made. Period. of all time.,This is the funniest -best written show of all time.i have never laughed so hard at a tv show or movie. who stupid idea was it to cancel it? Fox made a big mistake.
5,Funniest TV show EVER,Family Guy is the best show ever! It's different cutting edge and definetely not P.C! It's everything a TV show should be!
5,"Shame on you, Fox","Yes, Fox shut it down, but just maybe it'll come back. Right, guys? Right? Oh, damn. Yes, even though it'll be another five months before this volume comes out, I have seen every episode from Season 3 and I think every one is worth owning/watching. Very witty, very catchy and just plain hilarious. Thank you Seth for creating a wonderful cartoon and to the rest of the cast and crew for helping make it extraordinary."
5,"""Family Guy: The Movie""?","Yes. they are in production of making a family guy movie, as well as A direct to DVD movie, 25 more episodes and Seth macfarlane's new show ""American dad"". Sadly it fosuses on a more politiclly satrical show. For example: ""Brian wallows, peter's swallows"" is wat the new show will be like and nothing like episodes that focus on peter. Back to the movie, it focuses on an unaired episode, where stewie finds out he is gay. And American Dad is a mix of family guy and all in the family. It is about a CIA agent named stan, his family. and an alien named roger who he rescued from area 51. He will be the ""Brian and stewie"" of this show. It may air from anywhwere between late 2004 to mid-2005. ALLLRIGHT!"
1,"Amazon, what happened?","I waited for 3 weeks for my DVD to arrive, and when it finally did, there was only 1 disk, not 3. It wasn't even shrink wrapped."
4,"It's good, but not great","Family Guy is a great series, which utilizes lots of visual comedy to become one of the great comedy series of the last 10 years.Many of the jokes are Hollywood related, talking about fairly obscure people like Joyce DeWitt (Three's Company). I don't get many of them, but I'm no film expert.Volume 2, while good, is just not *as* good as Volume 1. The funniest episodes are in the first Volume. There is a lot of Broadway musical stuff in Volume 2, which has always been one of the things that bugs me about the show. When characters break out into song, I change the channel.If you like that sort of thing, go for it. If not, be warned that it's there, and it seems to be more prevalent in this set."
3,Not worth the money,"During it's first season, Family Guy was hilarious and edgy. By the end of the second season, the shock value had worn off and the jokes had lost most of their luster. By the third season, it was just barely worth watching.Stuey's take over the world routine had gotten more than a little thin, and Peter Griffin had more or less turned out to be a bad Homer Simpson/Hank Hill clone without the luxury of being sympathetic or very funny. The shows vulgarity had once been an asset but had now degenerated into a huge disadvantage. Though there were a few funny episodes, the DVD is only worth buying for hardcore fans."
3,ok,The DVD's are in okay condition but the case for the dvd's is all cracked and isn't usable and there is no cover on the case
4,family guy review season 3,"i have watch this show on tv, and i bout all the season on dvd, there are extended things on the dvds that u dont see on tv which i like"
5,The best TV show on TV,"TV's most disfunctional cartoon family is all here, and their final season (until they got picked up in 2005 by Fox again--a rarity in the entertainment industry) sparkles with the typical one-line, flatulent-heavy humor that Family Guy became famous for during its first three season run. The genius behind the show, mainly due in part of creator and star Seth McFarlane, has hardly been as appreciated as it should have been, largely due in part to the usage of cruel humor and hurtful celebrity-bashing the show bases much of its plotlines on; but people need to look past the crude fart jokes to see Family Guy is truly a freakin' sweet (thanks, Peter) piece of TV magic. This show doesn't require any insider, delve-in-deep intelligence or insight to enjoy the show, and that's part of the reason Family Guy rocks so hard. Like the best of SNL, Fox's born-again Family Guy is one of the best shows out there, regardless what conservative extremists may say."
3,It's okay if you're a fan.,Family Guy==moderately funny at times mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmm mmmm mmmmmm mmm mmm mmm mmmm mmmm mm mmm mmmm mmmmm mmmm
5,the best season to date,"Sure some seasons focus on Peter's antics and some on Stewies world domination, matricial delutions of grandure and some focus on Quagmire, Cleveland and joe but season three has to be the best over all Family Guy. It doesn't focus the interest on one character but instead incorporates every thing you have come to love about the show. Everyone shines even Meg. If you only purchase one season of family guy season three is the season to purchase."
5,Still hilarious,In the 2nd and final volume of Family Guy keeps the laughs coming with Peter's over the top antics. In the 3rd season the series goes more in depth with its charecters and become even funnier that the first two seasons. You have to get these hilarious 18 episodes including a never aired episode. If you don't think this show is funny well then you just don't like comedy. GET IT NOW! You won't regret it.
5,"This is the best show,nothing beats it","This it the best show ever made, infact they should make a day where everybody gets off work and school and they play it all day non stop, Season 1&2 were great and there is no doubt that season 3 will be too. By this or I will come to your house and beat you up."
5,Best cartoon show ever!!!!,"1. What are the two episodes per disk people talking about?There's 5 to 7 on all of them.2. Simpson's folks - there is no comparison.The two shows are too different.This is not a copy; its more creative and hard edged.The Simpson's is more polished; but Family Guy isfunnier. (Sorry, its the truth.)3. For a 2 1/2 season show; I'll let DVD salesand Cartoon Network ratings speak for me.It has been reported in TV Guide that Adult Swimis beating the ratings of Letterman, Leno and Kilborn(each) in 18 to 34 males. (Amazing)4. I watch a lot of TV but I never knew Family Guy existeduntil it was already cancelled and they were showingthe last episodes on Thursday. (2 hour blocks)If I didn't know about it; I doubt most others did.So its ratings were actually amazing.5. DAMN FOX TO HELL!!!"
5,Funniest Show Ever,Ok i love this show. I nearly piss my pants at every episodes antics. I mean its so random you just have to laugh. Theres no way to fight it. So if you dont own this go out and buy it right now. Its only like $40 and its worth every penny. Also if you dont have the first box set go out and buy that too.
2,family guy umd for psp,Did not realise UMDs from US do not work in my psp. Was not aware of different regions as games play ok
4,Borderline Ridiculous Fun,"Family Guy reflects just how ridiculous, how humorously selfish, how absurd much of contemporary life is. A highly recommended way to spend a few minutes with the unfortunate risk of addiction."
2,"Get Seasons 1&2, skip this one","The original writers left the show after the first two seasons, due to other projects. New writers were brought in at the last moment and the whole basis of the show went from clever humor and nostalgic references to fart jokes. Do yourself a favor and skip the third season, keep the first two seasons, which were in my opinion, gold."
1,family guy with t-shirt,It said comes with t-shirt. NNO T-SHIRT. THATS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS.VERY DIAPPOINTED. COULD NOT ANYWHERE ON THE SITE TO ASK ABOUT IT.
5,maybe better than the simpsons,THIS SHOW IS MORE OUT THERE. IF YOUR INTO THESE SHOWS YOU MIGHT EVEN LIKE THE SOUTH PARK SERIES TOO (CLASSIC ONES BEFORE SEASON 7-8 SCREWED IT UP). VERY SIMULAR TOO THE SIMPSONS BUT MORE OFF THE WALL AND DARING.IF THE PRICE IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU RENT IT/BORROW IT THEN BURN IT TO A BURNABLE DVD SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE. IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT TRY DOWNLOADING THE EPISODES ON THE INTERNET.
1,Worse Panasonic ever,"I have own 5 panasonics in the house and this was the last one I bought that have made me think that panasonic A/C had gone south as far as quality goes. The oldder panasonic I have bought many years ago were the BEST because they were freezing, extremely quiet, perfect quality that I would expect from panasonic. They were all made in either malaysia or Japan. But this model I bought was made in Shanghai China. The fan is misalign and it makes annoying loud noises. Even when the fan is not making noise, the unit itself is far from quiet. It is not cold at all. I left it on for 24 hours in a 200 sqft room and I don't feel any cold air at all. Once I shut it off, the room is hot. That tells me that the unit did not generate any cold air at all or it did not do a good job of sucking in the warm air. So do not buy this model."
1,Shoddy Construction,"I PURCHASED A LUFKIN MEASURING WHEEL AND THE MEASURING WHEEL FELL OFF AFTER ABOUT 300 FEET, IT IS ATTACHED BY SCREWS THAT WILL LOOSEN WITH USE.SO BEFORE YOU USE MEASURING WHEEL YOU HAVE TO TIGHTEN THE SCREWS. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER LUFKIN PRODUCT AGAIN...."
5,Solid insights for Lifestyles Marketplace,"As our company prepares to move beyond just offering products and services towards offering ""experiences and transformation"", Marketing in The Soul Age, by Harvey Hartman, has been vary valuable to us. Its practical and sound insights have proven valuable as we develop strategies to reach consumers in the new and often difficult Lifestyles Marketplace. We highly recommend this book."
4,Useful,"Excellent, not for the beginner. I bought this as a companion to Johnson's ""Sea Kayakers Handbook"" I could have just used this one."
2,a little low of a rating but...,"i was not expecting just a to do list for if you want to long distance kayak. it talks about gear and items you need and thats about it, i expected more and didnt get much. if i need reviews on gear i can find that, plus its outdated."
5,Could not put the book down.,I could not put this book down and had to immediately order the next one in the series. It is such a great parallel for our day and has great lessons to learn. It really made me think about my own life.
2,Too Easy,"The instruction is good, and I like that it incorporates the fitness balls; however, if you are already in good shape and have some mat pilates experience, the exercises are extremely easy and there are only 6 reps on many of the exercises. Definitely not for intermediate or advanced fitness levels. I am posting this review because I wish I had known this before I bought it."
4,"Yes, Yes, Yes, but then...","Three movements of insight, intelligence, suspense, beauty, feeling (especially in the beautifully executed adagio, the best since Boehm's 1980 VPO account), the right tempi and the gorgeous Vienna sound. And I already thought, this would be the one I have been waiting for since so long. Warmth, no steely sound like HVK. Finally, the perfect ninth, so I thought... But then, in the fourth movement, tragically, things go astray. No harmony, no passion, too many unccordinated individuals. Just compare to Herreweghe with La Chappelle Royale & Collegium Vocale & Orchestre de Champs Elysee on Harmonia Mundi (also on period instruments), and hear what true drama and exitement is really all about...!The next time, Sir Simon, with the Berlin Phil, listen to the Herreweghe (or a thrilling Solti with CSO), and transfer that spirit to the best orchestra in the world and let us marvel in the choral finale as well, please, please...!"
3,It's alright.,"I've listened to enough professional euphonium players to know that there are much, much better recordings out there. His style throughout the entire album is consistent, which is a problem when you're going from a modern piece to a romantic piece. It bothered me to hear such a mediocre performance of such great pieces of music."
2,Learn How The Bad Guys Do It,"This is an easily understood novel that is both interesting and informative about how hackers attack applications. The first half of the book is a simple story that keeps your interest, and the second half is a text book on the history of voting machines and techniques for reverse engineering computer software. You have to want to learn something about hacking to read this book."
2,SWISS CHEESE,"The Scifi Channel coproduced this lame, low-budget yawner. Once everyone gets on the space ship, the set looks like something thrown together by a junior high thespian troupe. Isabella Hofmann plays Harper, an alien out to experiment and study humans to find out their makeup. (ho hum). John Prosky is the alien leader, shaved head and filled with misanthropic nothings. Michael Weatherly is the somewhat hunky hero; Cristi Conaway is the sexy but bland other alien; only Eric Allan Kramer as the almost beefcake Bravo makes an impression: watch as he follows Conaway's sinewy, sexy glide in an attempt to pick up girls--it's funny. Even Jeff Kober (from Falcon Crest) doesn't do his usual seedy job as a snarly redneck. Low production credits, a meandering pace, and relatively poor acting sinks this one fast."
5,Its okay but be careful with the price,"I order this book because I needed for a class I was taking,Its okay but a bit outdated because our school system uses a more modern version so some commands don't really work, but the majority of them work so you are good.I rented this book so it was in great shape so I strongly recommend you renting the book because you get to keep the book for a around 5 months when each term is 3-4 months so I guess is better renting than owning (if you make copies of the most important commands).The ""renting price"" is something to be aware of because it changes every day,I ordered the book when the price was 50$ but the next day I checked an the price dropped to 25$ so I called and they fixed my money and offered me a refund.Thank You!So checked everyday to see if the price change for some reason...The book it's not that big as the others out there and it also has pictures as a reference to the commands you need to type..."
2,So hard to follow,"I have taken more than a few programming classes and read my fair share of technical textbooks. This is in the top two worst list for me. It's very verbose. It doesn't have screenshots. The charts are ugly to look at and not easy to follow. Someone clearly missed the point of a page break.To add insult to injury the author still has not published a digital copy. Now I'm lugging around a huge, poorly written text and I can't use a search function to parr down the verbose nonsense to get to the information I really need.I wish instructors would quit using this book for Unix classes!"
1,Do not buy,"This book will waste your time. The author can't explain basic staff.Not even one script worked!! Here is exactly in the book on page 417:"" We do not show the program headers...for the sake of saving space."" If I can get it myself, why should I read your book?! There are a lots of similar non-sense stuff!If you want to have headache, then buy this book. I will never buy any book from this author anymore.I wish other people had written this before I bought it."
3,weak adhesive,"The first one wouldn't maintain a good stick to my sander, no matter how I pressed it to the disk. After several stops to re-adhere it, it came lose while the sander was running and crumpled in the gap between the work surface and the sander disk. The second one in the pack performed better."
4,why so much packaging?,your sanding discs work fine and are easy to put on but why so much packaging to get them here?
4,A good starter,"AS far as one disc compilatioh go, this is pretty good. It can be a fine starter to Muddy, as you get his earlz one man /duo recordings -acoustic as well as electric featuring Muddys excellent raw slide guitar as well as his mid fifties and early sixties track with a gret fullband with Muddy's vocals getting even better and many of the best musicians Chicago blues had to offer. However, this is just a starter, as it does not feature gems like Honey bee, Streamline Women, Blow wind blow,or You need love to name a few and it has nothing from his post Chess recordings, which means you willmiss all material of the three great records made with Johnny Winter, not to talk about live recordings, which Muddy made plenty of also in his Chess days and that aren't represented at all too."
1,If Mein Kampf wasn't fascist enough for you...,"Delusion racist trash, published by the American Nazi Party - sorry, I mean the National Alliance (It's so hard to tell them apart). The truth cannot be found in this book - although if you can make it to the end I guarantee a splitting headache and an abiding distrust of ultra-right wing nutjobs!"
4,Proud owner of this amazing book,"Simply put, this book should become the new bible for White men and women the world over.Should you manage to hunt down a copy of your own I promise you will not regret it."
2,Breakable,"I had one for 2 weeks and some parts started coming off, easily breakable. If it was selling for $50 or less I'd recommend it but not for $130+.."
1,The thing stinks,"I bought this a few months back and it was a complete bust. Poop in the gears, non stop rake of the infrared eye gets blocked or the mechanism won't seat. It is loud as other have noted. It should come witht he top included not as an add on-I have two cats, one just jacked his fanny up and shot urine straight out over the side.If you don't mind digging hardened kitty litter out of the mechanism, the loud noise and daily tending, then you should do OK with this."
2,Sounds like some writers work for the company...,"The first review sounds a lot like what you hear when you call to report problems.The gizmo is good, as long as it keeps working. But you have to buy specific brands of clumping litter that they only tell you about when you call the center to complain. In other words, if the item does not work anymore, it is YOUR fault.The crap often sticks to the rake. You always have to dig in no matter what. And if you add a couple grains of litter beyond the line, the thing either does not rake or does not stop raking!"
4,Time Saver,"Though not entirely infallable (what is), Litter Maid is remarkably effective at doing its job. I've owned one for 5 years and consider it a great help. And will buy again."
2,Great for only One Cat,"I have three cats and purchased this item so the litter box could stay clean while I was at work. Unfortunately, the cats preferred the left side of the box and the ""scooper"" would jam and not work properly. It became harder to clean than the regular litter box. It is now boxed up in a closet. I don't feel like I can throw it alway because I spent so much one it. There should be a note on the box to let you know this product is not meant for households with more than one cat."
1,Maybe the worst engineered piece of equipment I've ever seen,"Bought one. It quit working within 6 weeks. The litter box lid never did fit correctly, and the unit just stopped running.Littermaid sent a replacement. The lid on the replacement wouldn't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment. After some fine tuning, the unit worked for THREE days before quitting.Perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived. The units I have bought and received are USELESS.As it is, I'm out $170 with no hope of a fix..."
1,RIP-OFF!!!!!,"I feel as if I've been robbed! The product jams constantly, causing me to have to scoop out the problem. Also, the rake mechanism is jerky, and at times, it literally shoots the s*** out onto the bathroom floor. And if your cat's stools are not firm, they stick in the rake. So you have to take the top of the unit off, turn it upside down, and clean it with a wet cloth. YUCK! Unless you buy the additional privacy tent, odors are just as bad as with an ordinary box. The only plus is that my cats get a kick out of watching it run."
4,Very good product IF ...,"I have used this product since its inception (at least 4 years). I have 2 cats. I can usually leave the box with no attention for about 3 days. I sometimes have to scoop some ""remnants"" but over all it beats having to scoop it every day and I can go away for the weekend without worrying about it. The MOST important thing in the equation is the quality of the clumping litter. I strongly recommend the litter made by the company that makes this box - littermaid. It works the best. Keep in mind that this approach will be expensive. The recepticles and the litter can get expensive. But if you have the money to spare, it beats having to scoop it once or twice a day (like I said I have 2 cats).As far as noise - yes it can be a bit noisey. But I keep mine in a closet (I cut a hole in the door for the cats to get in) and have no issue. You can always turn the power off at night and turn it on in the morning."
2,"Good, but not Great","I loved this item for the first few months and then it broke down for whatever reason. My problem was with the company. I spent about 6 months to a year trying to get a hold of the company for help. I tried emails, numerous phone calls and snail mail, but I never got any response. So I gave up and tossed it and pray that someone else (who understands what the phone is for) will make another version."
5,Who wants to share a toilet that doesn't flush?,"Before you buy this product ask yourself, ""Why do I want it?"" If your answer is, ""I'm tired of litter and looking at it"" then this product is not for you. This product is for people who love their cats and want them to have a clean toilet every time they go. The littermaid requires maintenance and cleaning just like a regular litter box. Take care of it and it will work."
2,Sounds good but isn't,"I got this litter box for two primary reasons, to keep the dogs out of the litter box, and to keep a constantly clean litter box with 3 cats.The box has about a 10 minute delay after the cat uses the box before it ""sweeps"" the litter. This is too long, since by that time, if the dogs want into the box, they have smelled it and are already into it. The timer cannot be changed. Also, if you have a curious cat, they keep getting into the box & delaying the sweeping, or get in the box without using it causing constant sweeping.Also, if the cat's feces is anything but full firm, it gets on the litter rake, and you have to take it apart to clean, which is much worse than manually scooping the box.Additionally, 2 of the 3 cats will go to the standard litter boxes, since they don't like the automatic one. One is scared to death of the auto litterbox and won't go within 15 feet of it.I had so hoped this would be the perfect product, but it has some definite draw backs."
2,cannot be repaired!!,"I have bought seven littermaid automatic mega self cleaning litter boxes over the years, and all but one have broken for the same reason---they continue to rake without stopping. A tiny red plastic piece breaks off into the litter. This small part is part of the control of the rake--without it you cannot stop the raking. Also, this usually happens about thirteen months after purchase; therefore not under warranty!! and it cannot be repaired. I am now looking at other models of automated litter boxes and hope to habe better luck."
1,Littermaid Poor Quality,"While this product cleans the litter box well when it works, the problem is we've had two of these stop working in 2 months. Apparently the motor driving the rake is weak and burns out easily."
2,Works Ok...Not Worth the Money,"My LitterMaid worked for approximately 8 months before stopping all together. Now it is a worthless plastic pale. If you pay a lot for this it is not worth it. I found that it did work most of the time but required a good deal of cleaning and upkeep. I was more involved in cleaning the litter more times with the LitterMaid than without it in many circumstances. It is also VERY LOUD. It must be placed somewhere that is not in close proximity to anyone sleeping or they will be waken up several times a night. When it worked it was a nice gadget to have. Unfortunatley, it did not work 100% very often."
1,What a nightmare!,"i now have two kitties and decided to take the leap into the self cleaning litter box world since i live alone and travel enough. i thought i was splurging for a good model but it turned out to be a big headache. the littermaid mega never seemed to work right. the first problem was that it would continue to rake the box over and over even though the dirty litter had been removed (and it's LOUD). it has come off the track about 10 times, the rake is constantly filled with waste and the most recent problem is that the rake is now stuck at the dumping position. i've had it for TWO WEEKS. would not recommend. also, don't bother with batteries, they last about 3 days."
2,"good book, i guess","this book had a good story. I did not like the way the author wrote about it, but the background was good."
5,Excellent!!,"I picked up this book by accident looking for something to do. I hadn't read a novel in years. Surprisingly within the first few chapters all I could think of was the book. I was hooked. It had it's humorous parts, it's scary and suspenseful parts. King's writing style is wonderful in that it kept someone like myself interested and also it makes the reader feel as if they personally know the characters. I couldn't wait to finish and start the next book. Awesome!!! Made a fan out of me: )"
3,Strong readable narrative,Do you enjoy great writing for its own sake? Then this book is for you. But I was dissapointed with the story. This book was recommended as being tops in modern mystery writing and I felt strained and cheated. I didn't like any of the characters. They were not believable. The situation of Tyler Road just wouldn't wash. A lot of writing seemed pasted in to make a bigger book. At the end I was hungry for a Linda Barnes book or a Donald Westlake. I wish I had started skimming earlier instead of waiting until I was 4/5 of the way through the book. If I donate this book to the Senior Center I will do so with a handwritten caveat.
2,I read 3/4 of it and skimmed the last 1/4,"I was really hoping to like this book...I generally enjoy female crime fighters (ie, Kinsey Malone, Kay Scarpetta and Barbara Havers). Unfortunately, I really did not like this book. King was trying to paint the heroine as a superwoman and seemed over-anxious to prove she was as tough as a man. Also, King went heavily into descriptions on several occasions, yet I had a hard time following her. I had to reread several passages because they were so mired in detail I lost sight of the big picture. I never did get a feel for the characters. I know I was supposed to like them because the author told me how virtuous they were, but I just didn't."
3,Character Mind Boggle,"Since thoroughly enjoying the Mary Russel series, I looked forward to reading Ms. King's police woman series. Unfortunately, my simple mind cannot function when a slew of characters are thrown at me. Therefore, several times I had to re-read previously read pages to get into my gray matter who belonged to who and why. Ms. King is excellent at character developement and I enjoyed Kate and her police partner. But it was a bog-walk getting to the final chapters. Toward the end the pace picked up and became entertaining. Kate and her police partner would be fun to follow up on, but am afraid of ""Character Mind Boggle""."
1,Bad plug,"The product shown on the Amazon website was what I wanted, but NOT what I received. The product received does not have a smooth outer diameter, but has ribs around the OD; it does not work for my application."
1,Don't waste your money,"It looked good in the package and did feel good in my hand but it felt and looked cheap. It is all plastic and the mouse ball was very loose plus it is very large in your hand. In my opinion it is a waste of money.When the item arrived and I unpacked it the serial number was smudge so you could not register the product.If your looking for a remote for your presentation I would recommend the Kesington remote. It felt great, eazy to use including the laser pointer, plus the usb adapter fits right inside the remote when you are not using it so you can't lose it. When not in use the battery turns off saving your battery."
2,"Great idea, but...","It is an excellent device for power point presentations... But after ONE MONTH of use, it did not want to work anymore. Only the laser still works, but, who wants that huge pointer without the mouse...?One more thing: The trigger should be the laser pointer, and the middle button should be the ""previous slide"" button. Iogear may build a fantastic tool if they follow this modest suggestion..."
3,IOGear RF Mouse,"I love this product. The screwdriver thing is an annoyance but let's get real...is it a big deal? No. The advantage of this product over ALL other presenters is, this device is a TOTALLY wireless mouse you can use anywhere! If you need to demonstrate any computer application to an audience, you need a mouse. Using this device, you can walk around the room and have complete control of the application! Normal wireless presenters usually don't work as a full-blown mouse, or if they do, they are clumsy. The Phaser has full mouse capability AND you can use it as a presenter. So what is the downside? THE UNIT IS NOT RECHARGABLE! BOO!! It eats batteries like candy so you ALWAYS need about 6 or 8 extra sets of batteries. If IOGear ever made this unit rechargable, it would be the perfect mouse. (and for the other folks, maybe they could include a screw driver, too!)"
3,Breaks easily,This is a great product but care must be taken or it will stop working. It dropped a few times from my desk and now it only scrolls up and down.
2,Below Poetry a More Accurate Title,"I wanted to like this album. Kalaniemi is a versatile and skilled artist, and I have enjoyed many of her other works. This project smacks of a bit of navel-gazing. Its rambling, uninspired ""melodies"" lack direction, sense of purpose, or individuality. In fact, I found one track sounding so much like each other that it was impossible to ever develop a sense of where I was in my listening. The liner notes confirmed that this was a largely unrehearsed (and perhaps even unprepared-for) project. It is amazing that the artist listened to her recording and thought others would enjoy doing the same."
5,PERFECT,jim carry was so good that it mad me qustion if it was really Andy Kaufmen. It actully make you feel bad for Andy.
2,Not what I expected,I thought this would be centered more around Andy Kaufman's experiences in Taxi. I wasn't expecting a somewhat boring role to role that he potrayed
5,Possibly one of the most underrated movies of all time,"""Man on the Moon"" has to be one of the finest movies I have ever seen. The acting and writing of this movie was phenomenal. I was not a Jim Carrey fan until this movie. He played the role of Andy Kaufman better than any actor could.A majority of people who did not like this movie do not understand the comedic genius of Andy Kaufman. Don't go into this movie thinking it is your typical Jim Carrey comedy, because it is not. This movie was meant to be a serious biography and it succeeded."
5,"Boring, snoring, flooring,....","If you are not willing to understand this film, please do not watch it, because it will be quite a survival. Boring, snoring, flooring,....For all you people, trying to experience the world of Andy Kaufman, this is certainly the most beautiful and moving film produced the last ages.Although some people think there is no humor in this film, well a pity for them. In my opinion this is good fun, especially when you are amazed every five minutes (even when you watch it for the eleventh time). But I agree, do not expect Jim Carrey. Although his name is on the cover, I did not recognise him at all in this film (i.e. good acting).There is an arteest on stage, a brilliant piece of arts. Whether you hate him or like him, you'll remember him for sure."
3,"Decent film -- a real downer, though","I went to this movie expecting a comedy, a real feel-good type of film. What I got was a depressing drama that leaves you with a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach.With that said, I'd like to say the acting was not excellent. Carrey (Kaufman) puts up another solid performance, will not as mesmorizing as THE TRUMAN SHOW among others. Danny Devito and the remaining supporting cast does not have believable roles and their lines are forced and predictable.Parts of this movie will make you laugh, but don't expect the whole thing to; brace yourself for a dramatic documentary.If you really liked this movie, I suggest you see PATCH ADAMS or GIRL, INTERRUPTED -- both of which have better acting while remaining in the same genre."
1,Not what Andy would have wanted....,"Oh man, where to start, ok how about this movie is too long. I felt like I was sitting through a six part mini series only I wasn't interested at all. Don't get me wrong, Andy Kaufman was a true innovator and comic genius, but anyone who understood him would know that he must be turning over in his grave knowing that a big budget hollywood bio-pic had been made about him. This movie stands in contrast to everything that Kaufman stood for mayhem, mischief, and improv. Jim Carrey does an admirable job but this movie is a mess. Taxi is just breezed over as are his relationships with the Taxi cast members. Courtney Love is a complete waste of space, her character has no bearing or use in the realm of the story. Pig vomit is pretty good as Bob Zmuda but he can't save this train wreck. Do your self a favor and watch the E! True Hollywood Story on Andy its shorter and much better."
1,Complete waste of time,"I can't believe all of the hype I've been hearing about this movie. While most will argue that this is Jim Carrey's best performance ever....it is still a totally boring movie and I can't believe that Jim Carrey put this much effort into a script which should've been thrown into the trash! I rented this movie and I've got to say that I just couldn't wait till it was over. I should've just taken the money, laid it on the table, and lit it on fire....I would've enjoyed that more than the movie...and it wouldn't have wasted so much of my time. I am very serious.....I have never in my life seen such a waste of film....even when Geraldo went to open Capone's vault and found nothing at all...at least I got a good laugh out of that!"
2,"Yeah, sure he acted it well, but highly overated.","In my opinion Jim Carrey has truly acted in two movies, Truman Show, and Man on the Moon. I still did not like Man on the Moon though. I find that when movies are accurate in depicting a biography, (which Man on the Moon was) they sometimes lose what an audience wants to see in a film. This was a funny movie. However, when I say that Jim Carrey acted in Man on the Moon I am saying that he acted in a comical character, I do not feel that he acted in any drama scenes. Truman Show was a comedy yet it still had drama scenes. I'm sure many people disagree with me but this is just how I feel."
1,Save your time and money,"...this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, four thumbs down. Please run away, save yourselves. I don't know who these people are who liked it but I would suggest some serious medication. The actors and anyone involved with this film must have hated Andy Kaufman. This film is a slaughter of his career. There is nothing even remotely funny or touching or anything in this film worth viewing. The best thing about it is that he finally died so I could hit the rewind...if only this were true for Jim Carrey."
1,Dissapointment for Gen X-ers,"I am stationed overseas, and the ""new release"" films we get are several months behind the U.S. I had read reviews of this movie from this site before seeing it, and I have to ask: ""Does anyone under the age of 35 ""get"" this movie?"" Come on, who wants to spend 2 hours watching a story of a ""star"" who ruined his own career? (Not to say that Mr. Kaufman wasn't a good entertainer, but it's something that should have been left to Vaudeville instead of video.)I could have spent the money I wasted on this movie for a Jim Carrey film that actually has some laughs. The acting was superb on all parts, but could have been better spent on a subject that could ""reach"" a wider audience.Comedy? Definately not. Drama...yes (No-one deserves cancer, which is the only teary-eye part of the movie)"
2,Not a good movie,"The reviewer ""Heather from California"" is most likely working for the publicity department at Universal Studios. She gives a raving review to a very bad movie about Andy Kaufman. This movie was a big disappointment, barely scratching the surface of what made Andy Kaufman a brilliant performer. It offers only fast snippets of his antics, omitting much of his most interesting work, and reveals nothing of his true nature. I am not alone in these opinions, everyone I have talked to about this movie found it very disappointing."
5,Good,"Article arrived in good shape. As advertised. I haven't had the chance to review the movie yet, but it comes highly recommenced."
3,not for everyone,"This film was a lot like the Kaufman. It had its moments of brilliance, and it had times that left you underwhelmed. If you do not care for Kaufman, do not bother with this film. No one could figure him out, so that is reflected in the film. He was a strange character. There doesn't seem to be an overall point to his life, other than to ammuse. Likewise for the movie. For what it is, it is good. But there are other biopics that are much more interesting. More because of the subjects than the film making.On the plus side, Jim Carrey gives a wonderful performance. I thought he was robbed incredibly by the Oscars for not even getting a nomination. He won a Comedic Actor Golden Globe for this role. Comedic role??? It alone is worth seeing. Worth renting, not buying."
4,Jim Who?,"When I first saw this movie I was blown away by Jim Carrey. With the exception of a few moments I forgot that it was him in the film. Jim truley became Andy Kaufman. I cannot think of a better performance from anyone this year.While the film may not have pleased everyone, I for one loved it. It was made the way that Andy Kaufman would have wanted it made. No one could tell where the truth ended and the fiction began. This is a great way to remember the genious of Andy Kaufman."
4,AN OSCAR WORTHY PERFORMANCE!,"Jim Carrey diserved an oscar for his incredible performance inthis movie! I've been a big fan of Andys, since I was a kid. Inever new he was such a psycho. Andys standup comedy routineswere absolutely hilarious! Jim Carrey did as good a job,bringing Andy back, as Jamie Foxx did, bringing Ray back! Ifyou're a fan of Andys, you have to see this amazing film!"
4,Rasslin' Andy,"This highly entertaining documentary is a compilation of video showing the late comedian Andy Kaufman's adventures in professional wrestling. One has to admire Andy's chutzpah as he insults the whole southern United States, impugning their intelligence and even personal hygiene. It really is awe-inspiring to see the passions he stirred up--almost no one got the joke. Andy was years ahead of his time in his appreciation of pro wrestling as gonzo entertainment--the whole scene was only beginning to heat up when he died. Includes a straight-faced interview with Robin Williams in which he mourns his friend's lapse into ""insanity."" Although this didn't happen very long ago, it makes you nostalgic for a time of more innocence--there was more pride in regional difference and less cable-TV driven cultural homgenization, and the ""sport"" could be used for lighthearted comic purposes, instead of being just the hormone-crazed, violent spectacle of today. A fun video."
2,Fun but pointless.,"I found myself disappointed by this movie. It's supposed to be a biography of Andy Kaufman, but the movie only goes into the shallowest of details, spending most of its energies to progress from one comedic routine to the next. While these comedic scenes are often funny in their wackiness, they're forgettable, and certainly don't make me want to become more like Andy Kaufman, apparently the director's ambition...The approach seems problematic. Jim Carrey was more or less put in the role of re-enacting Andy Kaufman's ""greatest hits"". Regardless of how good a job he did or didn't do, wouldn't it make more sense just to watch an old Andy Kaufman collection? I remember various channels broadcasting such programs, around the time the movie came out."
3,real thing is better,"This movie is entertaining and the story is well-told, but my problem is that it's not much more than Kaufman's routines done by Carrey. And while Carrey tries hard, I couldn't see him as anyone other than Jim Carrey. The physical differences between Jim and Andy are plainly seen when you look at documentary footage of Kaufman on the DVD. The movie offers no insight into Andy's madness and just reproduces old events that were much funnier when they were actually happening. I would recommend checking out documentaries on Kaufman (such as his insance wrestling career) if this film sparked your interest. Otherwise, if you've seen Kaufman's stuff, this movie sheds little light.However, the Tony Clifton stuff is quite funny, even moreso than when Andy did it."
2,I'd rather be on the moon than see this again.,"""Man on the Moon"" is the ugly step-brother to Forman's sensational ""People v. Larry Flynt."" All through ""Man"" I found myself longing for interesting characters, a story that had some substance, something funny. This is a movie about a comedian, right? Why was it so unfunny? I loved Andy Kaufman's brand of humor and I still feel the world misses him. This movie, even with the amazing Paul Giamati, could not bring Andy to life any more than a shot of adrenaline could for his corpse. Carrey gave a nice, if not completely flat performance. Love has the screen presence of a coffee table with a whiny voice. DeVito...was he even in this thing? By movie's end one is left to wonder, who was Andy Kaufman and can I get those two hours of my life back?"
1,Jim Carrey Why?!,"Yes why?! What was Jim Carrey thinking...? It's a very stupid movie. I wish I never watched it. It's not funny at all. It's so boring. The only reason why I watched it was because my sister thought I wanted it when what I actually wanted was the one with Reese Witherspoon. I just thought since he was great in Dumb and Dumber, Yes Man, The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura and others, that he'd also be great in this film but I was wrong. It's now in my trash."
3,"Boring, but entertaining","He was a star of TV's Taxi, a regular on Saturday Night Live and one of the most outrageous personalities in pop culture history. his name was Andy Kaufman. Jim Carrey stars as the legendary comedian, from his early club days to his untimely death in 1984."
2,Man On the Moon.,"It was too bizarre for me, Jim is a Good actor and He did a good portrayal of Mr.Kaufman but I didn't think much of the movie nor Am I obviously a fan of the person. Others should see the movie and decide for themselves."
2,A boring movie.,I was nevr a fan of Andys and this movie shown why towrds the end I might of showed some sypathy but o well we all die they dont need to put a bunch of stuff and cluter it together to make a non sence stuped movie. Even if you are a fan of his or was pass this movie up. Its not worth it.
2,If i were Kaufan i'd get [angry with] this movie,"I couldn't believe this. It's very boring and offensive. Most of the time I like Jim Carrey movies but this one really got in the way. This is a definite flaw. It shows nudity on it that is very offensive. It's not the worst though. the Blair Witch Project won that one. If you like Jim, get dissapointed. Also get dissapointed at The Grinch for also being boring. Me Myself and Irene is a much better movie than this garbage."
1,BORING!,Jim Carrey delivers an Oscar winning performance but the movie is so boring and terrible that it should have been burned.
2,Not too Good!,"Jim Carrey's performance was great, too bad Andy Kaufman's life wasn't, so don't make a movie about it. I was really looking forward to this movie it was a great disappointment to me and my family. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of Carrey's performance. Kaufman had problems but they would have been better shown in a documentary form in about 30 min. not a 2 hour movie. Kaufman was very hard to feel sorry for even in the end. Also he wasn't very funny at all, Taxi was the only thing he done well. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. Sorry Jim!"
1,strange movie,"this guy had problems for sure, i never seen his act, or his appearances on taxie..or even a clip, i had heard jim carrey's perfromance of theis truly bizarre person was good and was almost a carbon copy of the real man.i don't get his humour at all, or saturday night live for that matter, mad tv and in living color for me...!"
1,Don't Believe The Hype!!!!,"This movie fails on all counts. Why?1) Jim Carrey is not convincing is Kaufman. Carrey is tall and lanky. Kaufman was short and shlubby. Also, throughout the movie, Carrey gives this weird, letcherous leer that I suppose means that he is pulling a fiendish prank on us, the audience. It's more of a distraction than anything else.2) Danny DeVito plays his manager, yet there are scenes of Kaufman on the set of Taxi with the origional players. How strange is that?3) Not unlike the the Belushi bio-pic, Wired, the only way to appreciate Kaufman's comedy bits is to watch the origionals on vhs. Any immitations, even with Carrey, are by definition second-rate.4) Dare I say it: Kaufman wasn't that great! His stunts and hijinks were more the result of his LACK of talent. His routines reflect his inability to ENTERTAIN the audience, instead of irritating them. The pseudo-intellectualising of Kaufman after his death is the REALLY laughable thing."
1,"One star for Jim's excellent job, but....","Jim Carrey's acting is great. So good that you can forget its Jim. I liked The Truman Show, so I thought I'd give this one a chance. The problem here for me is that I never was a fan of Andy, and was always not even interested in seeing a movie about Andy. But, I gave it a chance after seeing Jim's other work.---the bottom line is that I don't like Andy's ""comedy"" and never did, and this film presents Andy's ""comedy."" The film will give you insight into what Andy was like when he did not do his act, and I found that as unagreeable as his ""comedy."""
2,Not as good as i heard....,"Man on the moon was an excelent biography, but a very poor and boring comedy. If you feel like laughing, this isnt for you. However, if you want to see the life of andy kauffman, by all means get it. I was pretty disapointed though..."
5,Spellbinding,"Jim Carrey is absolutely spellbinding in his portrayal of the late Andy Kaufman. Lore has it that Carrey stayed in character even when he wasn't shooting a scene. I may be incorrect, but I don't believe he was even nominated for an Oscar for this role and that is an absolute joke. The movie does a good job of moving through the different periods of Kaufman's ever-changing comedy periods. The one thing that I didn't particularly like about the movie was the time devoted to crowd shots, but I suppose that was Forman's way of showing Kaufman's effect on an audience. Highly recommended both for Carrey's performance and to learn about Kaufman."
3,Jim Carrey Is Great But. . .,"The film was really long to me. It had so many segments that were dragged out very long. When I thought it was over, which was by the way perfect, it had another 10-15 minutes more. To me, this film was basically an A&E biography. It told the facts and it really wasn't entertaining, hollywood style. BUT! I will say that Jim Carrey was brilliant and should have recieved allot more. If you're gonna buy this film buy it for Carrey's preformance."
3,Dry Law,"While I appreciate that Land Use is very LAW oriented, a little more time could have been spent on developing the guiding principles of these laws, rather than just stating them and talking about how just the decisions were (when some were not at all!)However, it would definitely be a good book for someone looking for a way to protect themselves from the illegitimate excercises and outright stupidity that Land Use Planning has become."
1,Failed after 14 months of use,"This drive started off great, but performance has been dropping off and the drive was sluggish. Yesterday it finally failed and all the drive will do is make a clicking sound. Not recommended..."
1,Yet another failure after 13 months,It is almost like they are designed to fail one month after their badly supported warranty ends. I would not recommend anything Lacie to anyone. They are surely going to go out of business with the reputation they are gaining.I am mostly disappointed in Apple for continuing to sell their stuff in their stores.Cost me my iTunes library and you know what a nightmare that is.
4,Easy to set up,"This was very, very easy to set up for my Mac PowerBook. However, I was surprised to find I need to plug it into the wall for power; I thought it would get the power it needed from the Firewire. Also, it is a bit heavy -- maybe that is good though as it seems very sturdy and secure."
1,Failure is the norm,This is the best external drive we purchased out of a range of external drive products and it gets one star because it did last a little longer than the other products.We purchased the first drive as a replacement for a failed Maxtor and the La Cie lasted a few months longer and had to be replaced.Six drives later we have finally been forced to find a hardware specialist to design and produce a custom made box from Addonics which we have been using for some time now without failure.The last of our La Cie drives has finally failed after 8 months in use and we will be returning it together with a legal demand for a full acceptable explanation for the failure of all these various drives or a full refund from the retailer.I would be a fool to recommend this drive (or any of the other major brands) to any person who relies on their external drive for mission critical backups.
1,Huge failure rate and dismal customer support,I bought three of these for a huge project. Two have failed.Buy a GTech maxtor or any other manufacturer. LaCie are junk andI will never touch their products again. The drives are third party drives.I tried pulling out the drives and enclosing then in an external enclosurebut discovered the two drives in the 500g are raid striped and difficult torescue when they will inevitably die.
1,Do not buy Lacie,"I have a iTB Lacie. It has not failed yet, but sometimes it just does not connect to my Mac, for weeks at a time. All the previous Lacie drives I have owned (three) have failed after a short time. I bought this drive after a two year moratorium on buying Lacie, to give them a chance. This drive is not significantly more reliable than my previous Lacie purchases. I feel I have wasted my money and I feel that Lacie produces inferior drives and cares nothing about its customers' data."
1,Delay Write Failed - Very Disapointed,"I have always been told that Lacie is the professional grade choice for drives. It is not the case with this one. I bought it in May 06 and have had nothing but problems. I have already reformated it once. Now I get continual ""Delay Write Failed"" error messages. Not worth the money for an unreliable drive. This is a very expensive paper weight.STAY AWAY FROM THIS HUNK OF JUNK!"
2,ALL Lacie drives,"The casings on these drives blow huge chunks. We've had two literally start smoking. One was only 2 weeks old. We simply went out and purchased two new casings (other brands) and they work fine. Yes, we could have pissed and moaned to Lacie and gone thru all of the red tape/hoops to get one replaced, but we were under a tight deadline and did not want to deal with the ""we are unable to duplicate the said problem ergo you can't get a refund"".Anyway, there time is done move onto the G-Raids, we'll see how long they last. Hopefully, with better customer service will prevail.Most people, purchasing these drives, are using them in a professional capacity and should be treated on the same level. The fact that Lacie will not own up to their product's well documented faults is a travesty.Who's got next 'cause it Lacie is thru.... Basic courtesy may have helped keep them alive, but we live int the USA and we have freedom of choice. Bye-Bye Lacie!!!!!Sorry, to vent!"
3,Easy to Use and Works Well,"It works well on athelete's foot, but is not as effective an fungal infections of the nails. It did really soften my feet and clear up the fungus under the skin."
5,Endearing film for Christmas,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film so much as I'm not a great fan of comedy but found it well acted and amusing. The theme of 2 men - one straight, one gay, experiencing how it felt to be in each others shoes, is probably not original but was portrayed in an amusing and catchy way. The opening sequence showed just how much young minds can be influenced by bigoted people and the end sequence portrayed the irony of how people change their views. I would give a special mention to Kirsten Lea who gave an endearing performance as the bewildered girlfriend who finds the love of her life changing before her just as she's ready to commit. A definite hit in time for Christmas viewing!"
4,"Not Perfect, But Entertaining Nonetheless","Walk A Mile In My Pradas is a comedy with a good cast, some good laughs, and a happy ending for all characters involved. There were some problems, though. I know that everything is resolved by the end, but there are some pretty homophobic and despicable characters in this movie. Thankfully, one of them changes and the other one gets sprayed with whipped cream. Despite some touchy dialogue, Walk A Mile In My Pradas is still a fun little comedy. And it was great seeing Dee Wallace, as always."
4,Look elsewhere,"True, these are good recordings of well-played Beethoven symphonies. The problem is that there are other far superior versions available. Instead of these, seek out the new Jarvi cycle or Vanska cycle."
3,"Very Good Dire Straits record - ok ""used"" condition","Despite the ""Condition: Used - Like New"" claim from ""Mr-Magazine"" the record wasn't really ""like new"". The cover shows wear. Ok, it is an old record but I already posses the same record for many years and my cover, w/o being too careful about it, looks much better. More important, the record itself has audible scratches. Why did I order a 2nd copy? I need it for A/B comparisons of different turntables and phono equalizers. The original record received top recommendations for music, lyric and sound quality and it is true, the record is really (still) very good :)"
5,This book was so great,In this book they get a call for the oss and they have to go on this kind of tv show and find out the truth about this other team. i bought everyone of theese books and so should u

2,Thin and Washed Out Sound,"For full disclosure, I have only symphonies 21-41 of this set which came as a part of a larger EMI Mozart set. I found the sound thin, blurry and washed out. I have a LOT of Mozart symphony sets, Marriner, Mackerras, Bohm, Bernstein, Naxos and Barenboim. This one is one that I will not be returning to. I listened to 35,39 and 41 and found nothing inspiring. The blame is not with Tate, I suspect, but with EMI for a very poor recording. Save your money..."
1,This one should not be even sold now,This book should not be sold to anyone - complete waste of money. First and most important that it is outdated and there is no tram line 20 now. And second it is not a map but a schema that you still need to put to the map to make it useful anyway. Third - in any hotel you will get much better free map. Enough said.
2,THE CHRISTMAS CAROL,"This tape is a good interpretation of the animated version of Scrooge, but it is defected - I do highly recommend this tape once it has been correctedCharles Dickens - A Christmas Carol"
4,Charles Dickens - A Christmas Carol,"The first copy I got of this was defective, but the seller reimbersed mt money quickly and the second copy I got works perfectly, they main draw back is that it is not subtitled or has closed captioning which is important for me as I suffer hearing damage."
2,DVD Defect,"The DVD has a defect in it. I didn't realize it when i bought it online, but then I saw a lot of people had the same complaint. The seller did refund me though."
3,Nice shoe is you don't need to walk a lot,"Cute and mostly comfortable sandal, but the tapered heel was a little too unstable for me with my walks-a-lot lifestyle. Also, the buckle was a bit uncomfortable."
5,Motorcraft transmission filter kit is great prize and quality,"This filter kit is a original direct fit Motorcraft part although it does't come with the gasket. Great prize and fast shipping, easy to install."
5,Christmas plates,This was an addition to other Christmas plates we had gotten for daughter in law for Christmas. She loved it.
2,Difficult Switch!,"I purchased this item for an 8-days white water rafting trip on the Colorado river. The switch for this item is a ""sliding switch,"" meaning you slide it side to side to turn it on/off. It worked fine for the first few days until sand got stuck between the switch and I was unable to slide the switch. Most of my friends purchased a push button version of this headlamp and they were happy with their purchases. My recommendation is that if you are going somewhere sandy, you might want to consider purchasing the other version of the headlamp."
2,left stranded,"i bought this while i was deployed in afghanistan . seeing at night is a huge factor here with all the rough terrain. this light performed like it should for about 2 weeks , then it started to flicker while in use. after a month it would shut off when it wanted to . didn't matter if it had good batteries or not , it continued to do it until it finally stopped working completely. HUGE LET DOWN PETZL . from now on i'll be buying princeton or just go without."
2,"Good news, Bad news","Good News: This product provides plenty of useful light, even with the red filter filpped-up to maintain night vision.Bad News: Despite sealing the case with sikaflex and electrical tape, the unit did not stand-up to the rigors of offshore use. I took this on a trans-atlantic sailboat race (crew of 4 on a 40' Class 40) and the unit failed less than half-way across. I don't know how, but the case cracked in 3 places, allowing salt water to penetrate, which led to the demise of the batteries and the unit itself.I recommend this unit for terrestrial use."
5,Great Headlamp,"I needed a head lamp for night land navigation in the army and this thing fits the bill. This thing took some falls and still functioned, very bright, and easy to switch on an off. Time will tell how it holds up but for now I'm quite happy with this purchase."
4,"Good light, not quite up to Petzl spec though.","This little light has the standard (good & comfortable) Petzl headband. The on/off switch is a mechanical slider that is a bit difficult to slide and to get used to. It is no where near as useful as the electronic push-button on/off/intensity switch on the four LED models. The flip up red light does have an orange quality about it when turned on inside a house, but once outside it feels more red. I wish there were a way to control the intensity, but then I knew that wasn't possible with this model. I bought this for use during night photography and stargazing. Will add an update after I do one of those activities."
4,Headlamp,"This is a very convenient headlamp, and was recommended to me by a friend who has had one for some time and likes it too. I use it for working in the garden at night. The Red lens keeps the light from diminishing ones night vision, and my friend tells me that if you want to see animals at night, the light w/the red lens up, does not bother animals."
2,Doesn't stand up to test,"I wasn't exactly thrilled with this product -- maybe I got a bad one, after all, not every product a company produces will be 100%. With that said, I used this headlamp on a two month underway on a submarine. The problems I had include the case not being able to fully shut with batteries installed, i.e. the batteries were too fat to fit in the designed holders. This caused the light to flicker in and out and between a bright and dim intensity. It was extremely annoying while in a dark control room trying to perform my job. Also, the red flip-up lens broke off with normal use. Also, if you are going to use this headlamp because you need the red light to save your night vision, be advised that the shade of red isn't as deep as a red LED -- it's more of an orange. Because of this, the light is noticeably brighter and not as ""covert"" as you may require."
1,fillter,"I bought 1 at Ranger Joes at benning, right before my night nav.All military personel! dont get this item! it does not give a red LED.It orenge insted, your buddys will want to kill you if they have there night vision and then you pull that thing out.I ended up getting some cheap 1 that u can get at walmart for $5, and thats great."
1,Description on item is wrong.,"I actually love the Petzl headlamps, very light and comfortable and well made. The reason I am giving this one star is the descption indicates that the light has 3 brightness levels and an blinking mode which it doesn't. It also indicates it has 4 leds which contradicts the title of the item. I think it's worth the extra money to get the version that actually has the 3 brightness levels and the blinking mode."
4,"Received wrong item, but it's still a great headlamp","Ordered two red flip-up headlamps but received two blue ones instead....Otherwise, this is a great product that I've been using around the house and for bicycle commuting. It's light, small enough to fit nicely in your pocket and comfortable to wear. It has great lighting distance. Overall, I'm pleased with the product even though it's not what I ordered."
5,musk,This is the only after shave cologne my step dad wears. I get it for him all the time for his birthday and Christmas. He really loves the scent.
1,Skip this one...,"Go for the Aqua Velva Ice Blue instead. The musk smells like Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds perfume for women. It is nauseating and smells very cheap. It unfortunately lasts an incredibly long time for an aftershave. For the same price, smell fresh, clean and masculine with Ice Blue instead!"
2,Not enough flavor.,I really love chai tea and thought I would try this one. It really wasn't a strong enough flavor for me. I would have to double the amount suggested and still it lacked compared to others I enjoy.
2,Not what I expected!!!!!,"I ordered this stroller because the price was right and it looks pretty durable. Assembly was simple. It is very difficult to steer, the wheels are plastic and the front two have no swivel option. I took it for a test drive around the block and it was horrible to maneuver going up and down hills. Seems to work okay on the flat areas. I received it yesterday and have decided to sell it already!"
3,Combi Iv Thunder,"It's okey, but one thing that dissatifies me is the front wheel. It is not rotatable, so it makes it harder for me to try to push it."
4,Good but not great,"The one and only, but very annoying problem was the front wheal not turning left or right, which made handling the stroller a bit challenging."
1,A Waste of Money!,"Complete waste of money. Bar is uncomfortable in back and product broke after a little use. Instead of refunding my money, Swimways sent me a few bars & screws to fix it. Do not waste your good money on this piece of junk."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I paid $150 for this piece of garbage yesterday. This product is so bad I do not know where to begin.The bars that go across the legs and back are killers.The coolers just fill with pool water no matter what position you are in.The three positions are all lie down. Sales person said I would be comfortable reading. No way, after ten minutes my neck hurt.Getting off this is really bad. It topples over you no matter how many different ways you try to get off.Pontoons are too hot to touch while in the sun. So where does one put their arms.Honestly I can't find one positive thing to say."
2,Buyer Beware,"Although this book has some good explanations, charts and diagrams, the reader should beware that the book has some very serious errors in certain sections (particularly section 5). It would appear that the book was self-published, and probably did not undergo sufficient peer-review. This book should not be used as a primary reference."
3,Packaging,It would have been nicer had it been packaged in the store fiesta packaging rather than a brown cardboard box. I had purchased 11 other place setting from various stores to get all the colors and this was the only one that came in brown cardboard
2,Fiesta 4-Piece Place Setting - Plum,I bought 2 sets. The cups in one set came chipped in two places. I didn't want to return the whole set so I found a replacement cup elsewhere.
1,Worst Customer Service Ever.....,"If you have an opportunity to purchase Fiestaware from another source, I suggest you do it. I waited nearly five weeks for one place setting of Plum Fiestaware. I was patient when receiving e-mails about delays in shipping my order. Finally the order arrived. There were deep scratches on the plate and cup---these DID NOT occur in shipping but had been packed that way. This was a disaster from start to finish."
1,Fiesta Black and White Set,"I recently purchased a double set of white and black Fiestaware.I was greatly disappointed to see knife marks on both sets after only using them three times. For years I had Johnson Brothers Heritage White and Waechtersbach red and black, and never a knife mark.These plates are cheap and a slight bump chips them. Plus it took three shipments to get an undamaged set."
2,Plum Fiestaware,"I thought I had ordered 5 piece set, but got 4 piece set instead. Plum color was way darker than photo shows almost blue very close to colbalt color. Sent the set back and lost $6.00 shipping so ended up paying $6.00 for nothing. Very disappointed."
1,TERRIBLE,"What a terrible vacuum. Worked fine the first time, but then went downhill incredibly fast. A mere 6 months after its purchase, this loud, useless waste of space will not even pick up a ball of dust, on any of the carpet settings. The accessories have pathetic suction when attached, and the bagless cup is a pain to empty, and scatter dust whenever it opens.Do not buy this vacuum unless you are going to give it to someone you hate."
3,The book is fine.,"There is nothing wrong with the book, but I was expecting "" Other Stories"" to be different ones. The older copy I have has some short unique stories in it and I was trying to find those."
5,My Grandson Loved It,The first time I came across this story I was at a public library. I knew then I would purchase the book. Since then I have been blessed with a very energetic grandson. I definitely knew he'd love this story. I have read the story to him and to my great nieces and nephews and everyone listened enthusiastically. We Love that there isn't just one story but three stories in this book.
5,great!,three stories in one book. the first is about being realistic about your abilities. the second is about self-sufficiency. and the third is about the dangers of starting something you cant finish. all in all a great book.
5,Fans of Trashcan will love this....,"This album is to Trashcan Sinatra fans what Nirvana's live, acoustic album was for their fans. For the few of us out there that have heard of and like this group, this is a great find. I stumbled upon it on itunes and bought it immediately."
4,Perfect for a lazy float in the pool,"Very comfortable lounge. Really nice on super hot days, as your body is partially in the water while you float. Got to love the cup holders. Pretty easy to get in and out of the lounge while in the pool. This is my second year with it and it has held up well. The only thing negative I can say about it is that the screws were a little hard to get in to attach the pontoons to the chair. But overall just what I was looking for."
2,blr,"The swim lounge is way too big, bulky, and awkward for a backyard pool. I keep it hanging on the wall in the garage because it it too much of a hassle to manage. The recliner mechanism doesn't work correctly."
5,great guide,"I wish I had found this earlier in my grad career. While some of the advice seems like common sense, it is still nice to have it written down in one place. Sometimes you just need a reminder of these things. Some of the advice I hadn't heard before, and I was glad to be able to read it. I keep it around almost as a reference book, because as you get to different stages of my grad career I want to refer back to it. I have also lent it to several friends."
1,Didn't do anything,I got these for my special needs son to calm him down. I didn't really like having to have them on me whenever he had a meltdown. I think they just placebos to be honest.
3,Not a very good remedy,Frankly I did not find this product sufficient enough to control my minor anxiety relief and recommend other alternatives for relief.
1,Did not work for me.,I took it for many days as directed but I had not even a minimal relief. I do not recommend it.
1,no difference,I have been taking the this for a few days and have not noticed any difference.I have tried other homeopathic medicine for other problems and they have worked. This one has done nothing.
2,A little ticked off,I woke up this morning to an overdraft in my bank account. I had my subscription set up for the 24th of the month. Today is the 14th and the funds were already taken out of my account. I use a card that is strickly for online use and I only have enough money on it for the things I buy online. No more. No less. Every week I put in exactly what is needed. Well my stupid $8 bottle of pills just cost me $35 + $8. I am very upset with this company. I am cancelling my subscription. I was giving this stuff a chance to kick in since I really had not seen a difference yet but I know it takes some time. I guess I will have to look for another company that sells it.
4,Aine,"For a first time reader of his work, it took me a while to get in to Willie Russell's style of writing and inclusion of poems. However, once I got used to it, I couldn't put it down. It was beautifully structured with parts of the story happening retrospectively which surprised and kept me interested. I will definitely try some more of his books."
3,Depressing and sad,"I bought this movie because I collect everything featuring Carla Gugino. The movie is depressing because a young man who had everything going for him threw it all away due to perceived racial prejudice. It is sad because it really happened - to Edmund Perry, in 1985."
1,Great performance - terrible mastering,"Unfortunately, this famous recording is sabotaged by the mastering. A result of the ridiculous collaboration between EMI and Callas' horrid sister Jackie, who claimed ownership of Callas live performances (like that could be true!!!!) this mastering, copied from either Verona or AS-Disc, is a few minutes too long due to a downward drift in pitch; its on three CDs while more consistently pitched versions on Melodram or Legato are on two. Look for the Legato version - its sounds better than the Melodram. But avoid this set."
5,Awesome,"I'm thankful to EMI for releasing this definite performance of NORMA in such brilliant sound. Were it not for the applause it could be a studio-recording. Absolutely beautiful, the very best Norma!!!"
1,Casta Diva in a Tin Can,"This was the first ""Norma"" I ever purchased, and it turned me off to live opera recordings for a LONG time (I am still wary of them and investigate them carefully).While I recognize that Norma was a great Callas role (I am not a Callas fan), unfortunately, this 1952 does not show it. In fact, the entire recording sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and there is an annoying (though periodic) hiss. The volume balance is also a problem--some tracks are inaudible while others will blast you into the next room.The moral of the story is, pick another ""Norma"" to purchase (preferably the Sutherland/Horne one)."
3,so so,"the grill itself is a pretty well made piece of equipment. however cust. service stinks! I needed a set of hardware to replace nuts & bolts that loosened & ultimately got lost. i recieved a little paper envelope in the mail. all the envelope contained, was a hole & no hardware. contated co, never heard from them."
4,Just a Touch of Honey,"This all organic candy may be initially offputting because it is packaged like a cough drop. Make no mistake, it doesn't taste like one.It is a mildly sweet, smooth candy with just a hint of honey. As I purchased many cases to be a part of a ""Bee"" themed party favor, I only hope that they aren't mistaken for cough drops & put away in a medicine cabinet somewhere because they would be missing out on a nice little honey flavored treat. Connie, Tinley Park, IL"
4,Old School Still Hits HARD!,"There is no shortage of CD's out there claiming to have the right mix of ""essential"" old school funk. Of course most of them have the same old jams and are predictable to the point of boredom. Old School Vol 1 is exactly what it claims to be; a selection of classic tunes and choice tracks from back in the day. After wearing out the grooves myself I recommend that this compilation is the one you should purchase if you want to remember just how great funk used to be (I mean Double Dutch Bus, Atomic Dog, Flashlight, etc) or want an intro to a genre that Dropped a Bomb on an entire generation. This one will keep the party happenin' for sure!"
5,Love the cd.,"I love this cd, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that Rob Base was on it. Everything else was from a different era. He should have been on a cd from the 90's."
4,A good book,"There is no escape from the fact that analysis is hard.I have spent a full year (academic year) with this book. Furthermore, I have several other texts on analysis compare to this one. This book is the best I have seen.A few more examples would a be nice addition. However, where present, the illustrations are excellent.I think the authors did a very commendable job on material."
1,Horrible book,"I won't say this is the worst Math book I have ever used, but it is certainly up there. No nearly enough examples. He proves the theorems and then throws 15 exercises at you with having done even one. Of course, on some chapters, he does have ""some' examples, but not nearly enough. My professor started using this book and switched in the middle of the course because of the difficulties the students were having.Steven Abbott's book is much much better."
1,Waste of money!,"The plastic is way too thin and flimsy to work with. It is a big hassle to try to attach to your cage and in the end it doesn't stay secured for 5 minutes. The velcro pieces don't stick to anything. The plastic scratches by just unrolling it. And they charge you so much in shipping because they ship it in a 5"" skinny roll in a 16"" box! I found this product to be a big waste of money and of packaging."
3,average,"start point 0 starstime covered (1949 -1998) +2 pointstracks selection (Cray duet/ no Sweet little angel, NO SWEET SIXTEEN!!!) 0 pointsNumber of key songs 6/12 +1 pointlength (just one disc, not near 80 minutes)0 pointstotal 3 points = 3 stars on scale.recomendation: buy it only if you are curious whether you'll like B. B's music, but not as a definitive hits collection."
3,"Appeared used, not new","This arrived with the packaging already cut open and so appeared that the item was not NEW, as it should have been, which was rather disappointing, if you pay for a new item then you should expect to receive a new item."
5,Ministry at its best.,Purchased on cd long ago the box set still contains my favorite version of nearly every song on it. A must have for true Ministry fanatics!
5,Wonderful Illustrations - Inspiring for Young Naturalists,This isn't the end-all-be-all books on bird identification. But it is not trying to be. My kids enjoy the Crinkleroot series and this one did do something that none of other books did... talked about how to use binoculars to bird watch. The gnome likeness of Crinkleroot will appeal to those with an attraction to Waldorf toys (we have many gnomes and fairies around here).The drawings are wonderful and have inspired my 5yr old son. He has used them as a reference in his nature journal.I would put the age range on this book around 3-7.
3,I knew it was used.,"Many of the books I've purchased that have been used were in much better shape than this book was. It was pulling away from it's spine and had been written in. It is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, so I was disappointed that someone else had signed their names in it."
1,Nay,Caitlin Kiernan's writing shows no growth whatsoever. For all intents and purposes these stories are the same ones as in Tales of Pain Of Wonder with different titles and names. It's tiresome. It seems like the author cannot come to the grips with the fact that the 1990s are long over.Avoid.
3,"Clever, But Tired","I've read all the Thursday Next books and liked each less than the one before it. While none of the sequels have been as entertaining or as innovative as the first, they have all been worth the effort. This, however, is the entry when you really start to feel how thin the joke has grown. The plot devices are teetering on the edge of whimsical and contrived and the humor often falls flat. There are still a few chuckels to be found here, but it really isn't worth a second look. You might be wise to check this one out from your local library instead of shilling out twenty bucks."
4,Worth your time!,"SOMETHING ROTTEN is a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging way to end this zany and inventive series. For anyone who enjoys literature and smart contemporary fantasy, this is definitely worth your time. Most of the people I've recommended this series to have really enjoyed it and been ""hooked."" If you're the type of person who can't suspend your disbelief easily, and has no patience for alternate universes and droll literary in-jokes, then pass this by.If you enjoy fun, intelligent escapist reads, then by all means check out the Thursday Next Series!"
1,"Love the book, hated the audio...","I absolutely love this book and I absolutely hate the audio version of this book. If you are a fan of audio books and/or the Thursday Next series, I highly recommend you go for the first 3 books on CD and skip this one. This is a different narrator from the first 3 books. She has a very limited range in terms of the voices she can produce. Half of the characters sound exactly the same. She also pronounces many of the names differently from the other narrator, something I find very annoying. I hope that she is not used for the fifth book in the series."
3,Maybe 3 1/2 stars...,"For the money, this is a great little vacuum. I have had the Eureka Mighty Mite for years which I actually love. I bought this for work and it's got quite a bit of power. I don't love the hardwood floor attachment, and the #1 problem with this is that the bag holds about 2 tablespoons of dirt. So, that's why I figure this is so inexpensive. They are making their money off of the bags for this baby, because they need to be changed at least once a week they fill up so fast. But that's my only complaint!"
1,miserable vacuum,"I vacuumed up a broken light bulb one evening.Next day, I noticed broken glass underneath the vacuumin the closet where I'd stored it.Also, the plastic exhaust/vent cover is not rigid enough to stay wellattached. As a result, my leg gets blasted by the exhaust (and dust, presumably) as it bypasses the vent.Price is cheap $50, so I wasn't expecting much. But this little vac delivered even less. I am returning it after just a couple weeks.I will try the Eureka 3670G, which I am hoping is similar to my old Mighty Mite (which was a great, cheap little vacuum)."
1,don't buy this vacuume!!!,"I am on Amazon.com today to look for a new vacuume!!! About 3 months ago I bought the Eureka 972A canister vacuume...and it's the worst thing ever. I have wood floors and thought that it may work good....but it scrach my floors. Then I thoght I could use it on my ruggs but that does not work either bec it just dont have any suction power. It may seem like a good price....but save your $50 becuse it wount do any good! I whish that I would have spent a little more money to begin with, and gotten a vacuum that actually works!!!!"
1,Warning: do not buy this piece of c***,"do not even consider buying worthless Eureka 972B. I have loved Eureka; for over 10 years I had a great Eureka and it's still would work, if the cord & wheels did not fall off.I bought this Eureka compact in October 2007, now in June of 2008, it quit. I have stone floors, two area rugs and a 1000sq ft (temporary)house to clean. The Eureka could not pick up fallen dog hair, nor the dust for which I bought it for. The bags are so puny, that an Ant could not make a home of it. The power that drives the suction stops at the coiled hose.End result, had one good Eureka, one that was not worth the postage. Only thing I found that was likable, was the color. Fun Yellow, but this Eureka does not suffice as a Frisbee for my dog."
4,Eureka 972B,"I replaced a Kenmore bagless canister with this model. Both are very similar. The Eureka has more power, is quieter, and best of all; I don't have to clean the filter every time I use it. I am using this on about 1600 sq ft of tiled floor. I live in a dusty environment and have 3 cats which gives me a lot of hair and tracked cat litter. I have used the Eureka for a month and have not changed the bag, not even close.The first and only problem I experienced the last time I used it is that the retractable cord lock will not lock. This doesn't seem serious and I'm confident can be easily repaired.For the price, I would definetly recommend."
3,"Good quality, poor attachments","This is a sturdy, attractive, lightweight vacuum cleaner with good suction. It's easy to operate and a handy size. I would have given it a much higher rating except for the attachments, most of which are way too small. The brush, for example, is tiny and covers only a small surface. I already have an upright vacuum so I bought this one mainly for the attachments, which I thought would be a standard size (like the main parts are). I do like using this vacuum on floors, but it isn't very practical for window blinds or other hard-to-reach places."
3,Worked a week and broke.,"I bought this Blue Trimline phone for a friend because she wanted a beautiful blue phone she could hang on the wall. After searching online I was happy to find this. Unfortunately, it only worked a week and she didn't tell me until I came to visit months later. I was unable to return for replacement. I would have liked to give my friend a phone that worked."
3,Nice pictures but a little disjointed,"This is a book that tells you about the nice parts but don't hope to get information on putting the ideas together. It is was the title says, I guess."
2,not comfy,"Cute, good color, but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size"
3,A Decent Replica,"This is a very decent replica of the natural shofar at a fine price. It is physically attractive and sturdy. However, mine arrived with a mouthpiece that was merely a thick, blunt stub. In order to sound well, that area required extensive, careful reshaping (in this instance, with a Dremel, using both shaping and sanding heads). I stress the word ""careful"" because the shofar would be ruined were too much stock taken off in the process. Also, the product description indicates that THREE notes are possible. I have been able to evince only TWO (and the accompanying pamphlet indicates only the TWO)."
1,unbalanced and often sparse,"While it contains some useful information, this book is rather haphazardly written. Some years are beyond skimpy, and the information is in several areas dubious at best, if not blatantly erroneous. The anonymous author's tone is occasionally supercilious (think Joe Queenan), which is fine, if you're into that sort of stuff. I think the author finagled a way to give himself the one good review."
3,This is Pop! (Culture),"""What Was Hot!: A Roller Coaster Ride Through Six Decades of Pop Culture in America"" lives up to its title. This book touches on every aspect of pop culture in America in the 1950's going through 2001. It covers the hit movies, music, actors and fads in each year. This book is a good reference tool for anyone interested in pop culture, but this book can get boring because it feels like some parts where written in a hurry! If you are a serious fan of pop culture, check this out. If you're a casual fan, skip this one.Taylor Hodgkins, 6/23/08"
4,An Engrossing New Tale,"Me, Myself and the Eight is one woman's quest to hold on to her sanity by any means necessary.A.F. Allen tells an interesting story and once you get into the novel you won't be able to put the book down.Felicia Morgan owns her own accounting firm and literally bumps into Tyrone Eggins while waiting on the eight train. She is leery about embarking out on another relationship, but her self-conscious kicks in and she finds herself battling within herself on whether or not to give Tyrone a chance.Tyrone is a professional ballplayer and fights hard to prove to Felicia that he's not a player. During the course of the story, he does things that Felicia has only dreamed of. Is he too good to be true?Take a ride on the eight in A.F. Allen's engrossing new tale Me, Myself and the Eight."
5,Lifesaver,"I am so grateful for this product. My dog would not take his medication no matter what we wrapped it in (lunchmeat, peanut butter, mash potatoes, cheese, meats). You name it, he refused it. Eventually he stopped eating entirely because he could smell the four pills in his food. I was resorting to grinding pills twice a day and squirting the smelly liquid into his mouth. It was terrible. Then the groomer recommended Pill Pockets. I honestly didn't think it would work but it has literally been a lifesaver. He loves them and eats them like treats with his pills inside. I get the small, beef flavor . My dog is almost 14 years old and on heart medication. I was losing hope a few months ago until I found this product. Now he gets his medication twice a day everyday and he he looks forward to it."
5,Great Product....Great Company,"I have been purchasing pill pockets for about 6 months now due to my 7 yr old Beagle needing her medicine twice a day. She is excited to eat them everyday and doesn't have a clue her medicine is in them....or doesn't care because of the yummy taste. The price was excellent compared to the $9 - $12 for one packet in most pet stores. More suprisingly was the customer service I received. After sending an email requesting money back for my expedited shipping costs as I did not think I received my order in time, I quickly got a response. A representative from the company explained exactly how expedited shipping actually worked (I wish Amazon was this detailed) and that they were in fact within the time limit as promised. I received several emails back that not only answered all my questions, but also educated me on the whole shipping process. I appreciated the personalized service I received, and can't wait to buy from them again!"
5,Excellent for administering regular medications,"This is a great product. We give our dog daily medication, plus his monthly heartworm meds. This mades it so much easier than trying to stuff pills into cheese or hotdogs. My dog actually looks forward to his medication now. Highly recommend."
5,Flawless,"The former review absolutely has ""IGNORANCE"" written on it. Callas never shrieked in her life, esp. not in the years 1949-1959. This Aida finds her at her most luscious, easy and brilliant time. Her voice is as rich and beautiful as cream and it beats such canaries as Sills and such bores as Tebaldi and Sutherland easily. This Aida not only has the unsurpassable Callas but also del Monaco, Taddei and Simionato. All GIANTS, VOCAL GODS! No other Aida can boast so exquisite a cast! Callas RULES! Such hatred only proves her genius. True geniuses were always hatred. Look at Caesar, he was killed out of jealousy and petty hatred. Forget the heartless basher, his divas will suffer the same fate he inflicted on Callas."
4,Callas and Del Monaco,Excuse my previous review--Callas and Del Monaco were paired together at least twice--and this is the proof! A somewhat inferior radio recording (this is why it receives 4 rather than 5 stars) of two of the greatest vocal virtuosos of the last 100 years or so. This is a must for those refined music lovers who can discern the higher standards of performance demonstrated by these two timeless artists!
2,POOR RECORDING,"I bought this CD based on two things: Maria Callas and a customer review. I truly regret taking the reviewer's advice. This is an extremely poor recording. The Triumphal March is thin and tinny. In fact, the whole recording sounds that way. The reviewer even said that it sounded better in mono rather than stereo. I totally disagree. I came back to this site to re-read the review and I can't find it."
5,Eric,"I think this young man sounds amazing; I have been following his career since he was in high school and he has never ceased to amaze me with each new adventure he has embarked on. His professional career is International now and he gets better with age, just like a fine wine!"
2,What grows in Iowa...,"Bradley Moore is one top knotch accompanist and Mr. Cutler was fortunate to have him. his is a disappointing debut album, it fell short of expectation after hearing the Met broadcast of La Juive in December. His voice is so incredibly effected that there is no connection between the singer and the text. And thus, it immediately resonates as FALSE to the listener. One wants to be swept away in music, not question if Mr Cutler too much of a juvenile to understand the emotions he is singing about.To his credit, Mr. Cutler has solid technique. Unfortunately, technique does not make an artist. The fundamental element that is deficient here in both the cd and in the artist is HEART. If Mr. Cutler would only bother connecting with others, unveiling their humanity and revealing his own, then he would surely avoid the self conscious/self indulgent errors of relying solely on technique. Heart and humanity make an artist, a lesson Mr. Cutler is in dire need of learning."
3,Window Guide Clip,Don't Like Chevy products but I needed this to replace the broken guide on my brothers car so I bought it.
3,Not the best Dear America Diary,"This book is suposed to be a diary, not a ""story"" book. Personally, although the story has a nice plot, it reads like a story, and I think it has too many coincidences to resemble ""real life"". This seems to be fast becoming a trait of the Dear America diaries. I have been collecting them since I was twelve, I am now fifteen and am really noticing the differences in the newer books. The older diaries were really like diaries. Bad things happened, it wasn't all sunshine and smiles. Even though Maria's best friend died, it is glossed over. I think that Valley of the Moon is good historical fiction, but isn't on the same level as some of it's predecessors."
3,Valley of da Moon,"In Alta California, Rosalia keeps a diary as a friend what had happened in 1846. Rosalia was just 13 years old and 14 in the next part. This happened when she has to stay with the Jhonston family in Alta California. It also happened in All Soul's Day which is called: "" Day of the Dead"". All Soul's Day happened 2X in her diary. In the end of the epilouge, it says: Rosalia went to San Fransisco at the age of 73 seeing the Jhonstons and she was killed in the great San Fransisco earthquake in 1906."
4,Between - 'Dharana' (Yvp) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1978, looks to be Between's third proper release. Personally, I like their first album, 'And The Waters Opened' a tad better. Tough to describe, but try experimental / kraut-like. Some just might simply tag it as 'World Music'. Two best tracks are the title cut ""Dharana"" and the seventeen minute epic ""The Voice Of Silence"" (nearly worth the price of admission alone). Line-up: Peter Michael Hamel - keyboards & organ, Robert Detree (Embryo) - acoustic guitar, Gary L. Todd (worked with Terry Riley, Stan Kenton) - bass Robert Eliscu - oboe and Cotch Black - Drums & percussion. A nice piece to own."
5,An amazing plot!,"Ms Collins has penned a winner with Sword Across Time. This book is a page turner, filled with witty dialogue, ancient magic, multidimensional characters and well rounded secondary characters.Ms. Collins has found the recipe for a book that will blow you away. Suspense, paranormal, humor and romance. If you love the mystique associated with Merlin and Nimue and the legend of Arthur and Excalibur, and want to read about a beautiful modern love story unfolding, then I highly recommend Sword Across Time.I was enthralled, impressed and I can't wait for Ms. Collins next book."
5,DA BOMB,I have been playing SWAT3 for ever and this version is better than any othe fps even r6. In this game the single player is OK but hte multiplayer IS COOL hardly any loading and 1000s of mods. Want a paintball game? download zpaintball mod to get a paintball game or perhaps a r6 remake no problemo! (...) theres like 100s of players online and an easy to use multiplayer lounge. This game is so cool! in single player ther is anout 20 levels and 3 weapons but in multiplayer thers 500 downloadable missions and over 900 guns. This is cool!
5,simply the best,"make sure you buy this game, for SWAT3 is simply the best single- and multiplayer-game existing: gameplay, graphics, sound, action, content!"
1,"if you like terrible graphics, and even worse gameplay... try this complete waste of time!","when i got this, i was expecting a really cool and kinda creepy FPS... but instead i got a game where all you do is raid buildings for criminals. sounds ok right? well if you put in the terrible gameplay, graphics, and absolutly no music... this game starts to really suck.i've played alot of games... and this isn't a good one, i would know! so since your looking at FPS's, i'd recommend Timeshift, section 8, or F.E.A.R. all of those are AWESOME:)P.S. if your dependant on getting this... you should know that it does work with vista, even 64-bit versions."
1,Keyboard ok.. mouse weighs a ton!,Sorry Microsoft.. go back to the drawing board on this one. Keyboard works ok... you don't get the 6' range they claim.. outside of 3' I get inconsistency. Mouse is a Mack Truck! Where did all that weight come from? It's not the batteries.. haven't a clue- but this unit is going back. Convenience of wireless blown away by weight of that mouse!
2,Mouse Really Is Way Too Heavy,"The mouse really is way too heavy. Regardless of whether it weighs 5 oz. or 15, it's by far the heaviest mouse I've ever had to use. My hand and arm are worn out after an hour of use.I kind of like the keyboard, though. It seems to work pretty well and haslots of features for a lower-cost keyboard, including the ""special function"" keys such as email, home page, etc. (I didn't understand how great these can be until you get used to them). My only problme is that the function key functions for Outlook are switched around (and hard-labeled), and the ""Send""/Receive key doesn't seem to work.Overall, though, I'd pass on this combo. Find one with a mouse that only uses 1 AAA battery instead."
5,This book is delightful!,"Margy has a way of describing perfectly the antics of her cats. She has a way with words that captures the spirit of cattitude and transports the reader right into her living room! My book is a treasured possession. I like to read it out loud to my cats. They pretend not to be impressed, but all sit and listen, tails twitching, blinking slowly, and with just a slight movement of whiskers that suggests they are smiling. If you are a cat-lover, this book is a ""must-have""."
3,"Amazing music, bad idea","Sure, the music is amazing. I suppose you can call this a Allman Brothers sampler.If you've never bought an Allman Brothers cd though, you're SO MUCH better off buying their albums. Start with these, The Allman Brothers Band, Idlewild South, At Fillmore East, Eat a Peach and Brothers and Sisters."
2,Save Your Money,"This album is entertaining for the first listen, but then becomes unbearably saccharrine. It's alright for taping, or getting a copy from a friend. Definitely not worth buying, however."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"This is just what I needed. A new cd which I'll likely ruin by listening to it over and over again so many times because it's that good. Not one bad song on Full Moon Cigarette and that speaks volumes in itself of the talent. Also, if you listen for a little longer after the last tune there's a little surprise at the end. One more song. Two thumbs up, awesome CD!"
5,AWESOME!!,Full Moon Cigarette has not been out of my CD player since I received it. Gran Bel Fisher's singer/songwriter talents are far beyond his years.
5,The best of Narada on one CD!,This CD was my entry into the world of Narada. I love it! I use it to put me to sleep. I recommend this highly.
4,Pleasant Reading,"I purchased this volume of poetry as much for comparison's sake as for pleasure. I've piled up the latest Norton Anthology of Poetry, Christopher Ricks's edition of The Oxford Book of Verse from 1999, and The Oxford Book of American Verse as I study for the GRE subject exam in English Literature. The Norton should serve the practical needs of any student or reader, but I purchased this after skimming it in the local library, deciding to compare the selections by renowned poets found in most anthologies as well as view the work of poets who have now faded into relative obscurity today, or at least, they didn't find their way into my undergraduate syllabi! Even after exam preparation, this will be a pleasure to open, and it is certainly an easier travel companion than the unwieldy Norton. If, however, you're looking for twentieth century poetry in your survey, then try to locate the Ricks volume."
2,pyramid review,"I bought these for my dj system in custom enclosures, and they couldn't handle the power. Started to rattle. Maybe need to use small sealed enclosure but not good for ported boxes. bought other brand subs for my boxes and they sound great!"
2,Hoping Big but Disappointing,"The title ""Comprehensive Orgainc Transformations"" strikes me with much hope that all representative functional groups tranfer and reactions will be fully explained and included in one volume for easy reference. Well, not so quick.Cited references from this volume might be the only (+) that I will credit to the piece. The organization of the book is extremely perplexing and weird. It is not very easy to find a reaction that I desire. In fact, the details for transformation are disappointingly little. If you plan to get this book with the same expectation, you should turn to Jerry March's Advanced Organic Chemistry or the Beilstein Cross-Fire Organic Reaction and Compounds software. Any advanced texts on organic synthesis will give you more details.Oh, by the way, the price () is just stunningly high and ridiculous."
2,stiff fantacy,"I bought this book because I love fantacy novels. Although, the stories are well written and classics. The book reminded me of assigned literature from english class, a bit dry. I did find a couple of stories cute, but not great. This book is easy to put down. If you wish to know the evolution of fanticy novels then you would enjoy this book."
1,Does not work properly,"The item turns on and off for no reason. Not a good product, possibly be good if it actually worked. When it is working then it sounds alright. Also, the picture does not actually represent what it looks like. The PSP sits on a clear plastic cradle, it does not physical connect to the speaker."
4,Evil that good men do.,"This true story of a hijacking and hostages. A disturbing fact filled book: extreme human experience. Hostages and captors,not imaginary but real in a part of the world ,that maybe in 1980 would not have half as much interest as it does now. That sad commentary for Americans today. Maybe if we had all had this book on our list to read ,we would not have been so foolish to think such a thing only happens: Not Here,but in another place.."
2,Beginners book,"This book is for a teen or beginner starting their first expeditions into the world of songwriters. The book gives about a paragraph in every possible area of music starting with the history of man, but gives less info of use to intermediate or above levels. One glaringly hilarious inclusion is the suggestion that you can make a living as a musician in NYC but not elsewhere, or that a deal can be made on a handshake in the music biz. The section on the Nashville chart system is helpful. Take a look, but be sure to supplement with ""Tunesmith"" by Jimmy Webb, or any of the many other books by successful Hit songwriters."
5,I Never Knew,"I own about 50 songwriting books on different sub-topics. This one is the broadest look at the subject- it covers what any ten of the others do. It's not perfect, but if it was a thousand pages longer, it would be. I'm planning a trip to Nashville soon and this will be a big help!Kenny"
4,Awesome,Very nice for someone looking for the basics and then some to get started. I enjoyed it and so did my family.
2,Overpriced and under supplied,"I bought this fall 2011 in preparation for the April 2012 Civil PE Exam. I used this to prepare for the morning breadth exam. I was disappointed, not in the questions, they were representative of the NCEES exam type questions, but the number of morning questions in here is very short. I felt short-changed like I'd paid too much. For a new price over $100, I'd say you should find a cheap used version first, or other references as an alternative. The price for this book should be about $25, not $100!"
4,Good Study Guide,"This was a great book, I really liked that it included in the solutions where to find the charts and equations that you need in other reference books like the AASHTO Green Book and The HCM. It really helped me prepare for the PE Exam. Some of the questions might be a little more difficult then the test itself, but at least I was prepared for everything."
2,Controversial view of Southeast Asian prehistory,"Eden in the East turns the prevailing archaeological view of southeast Asian prehistory upside down. The author presents a view of southeast Asia as the cradle of civilization with the technology and culture of an Ice Age southeast Asian subcontinent spreading north and west at the time when the sea levels rose following the melting of the Ice Age glaciers. An interesting idea, but without real support of actual archaeological excavation on the part of Dr. Oppenheimer (a pediatrician). The author picks and chooses data from many sources to suit his theories. A questionable technique to say the least. The second half of the book reviews the legends and myths of various cultures concerning creation, floods, Cain & Able stories an so forth. Mildly interesting, but not convincing."
3,Eden could also be the Mu (pronounced other ways) of Oceanic legend,"Anyone interested in another theory, though it doesn't refute anything presented in this book, check out this article, see the map of Sundaland at the bottom of the page.The article is written for the Cthulhu Mythos genre, but aside from that, the facts presented in there are real facts based on real finds that include Sundaland - a land that is now under the ocean. That's the place that is being referred to as Eden. If the article is uninteresting, just jump to the bottom of the page and SEE Sundaland for yourself. There is also a very large image you can get to from the bottom of the page. The image was made from an actual map of the ocean floor."
4,Mixed Bag,"Mr Oppenheimer's book has some interesting ideas in prehistory of SE Asia and counter againist an entrenched European centric view of civilzation and shows some good evdiance in that Prehistoric South East Asians may have been more advanced than we previsoly suspect. However Mr Oppenheimer is not an archeologist or a scienist who does work in these fields and some of his theories seem way out of there. For instance in SE Asia there is an division of people who are lighter skinned and have mongoliod charasctces and must have shared an common recent ansectry with the Chinese and Nergiod looking people who look like Australian aborigines, which must told an recent story of invaders from the North."
2,ONLY FOR NON-ASPERGERS,"I am an adult with Aspergers and bought the book after reading the great reviews here. Although it is a good book that shows some aspects of the Aspergers world to outsiders, for us who live and swim in it, this was an unsatisfying book. It merely scratches the surface of our world. Buy it if you want just a glimpse in."
4,Neurotypical (NT) and autism/Asperger's (a/A) - Meet Halfway,"This book brings to mind June Carter Cash's beautiful, fair-minded statement to husband Johnny Cash: ""I'll meet you halfway."" A more fair and loving statement has yet to be made.I did feel it was helpful in many respects. It is good to get the voice of a man who has intimate, personal knowledge of a/A and explaining some of the sensory issues that accompany this neurobiological condition. Since people on the a/A spectrum are expected to make concessions to the NT world just to get along socially, it is nice to have books like this that provide explanations of what people with autism contend with. The world is for everyone and not just for the NT population. Shore does a good job of encouraging NT and a/A to meet one another halfway. This is about cooperation."
5,Andsnes on Grieg and Schumann,"Leif Ove Andsnes rarely puts a foot wrong, and this recording proves the point. He might be considered to be a ""natural"" for his fellow Norwegian, Grieg, and he certainly is, but he is also splendid in his recording of Schumann's magnificent concerto. The Grieg's fiendish last movement is superbly executed, and his musicality is everywhere evident in both concerti. This is terrific stuff, and Andsnes brings new life to a favorite pair of ""war horses."" Highly recommended!"
3,You don't miss your water ...,"I've owned the Kovacevich (BBC SO/Davis) version of the Schumann and Grieg piano concertos for some years and been somewhat disappointed at the less-than-sparkling audio of these 1971 Philips recordings.Favourite Piano Concertos, Vol.2Decided to buy the Andsnes version after reading several reviews. Not a disaster, but a wake-up to how truly excellent the Kovacevich version is. The Schumann concerto is my favorite and Kovacevich's phrasing and momentum envelop you and sweep you along in a way that - at least for me - Andsnes does not.So I'll be sticking with the Philips discs for a while. The trade-off between audio quality and performance is no contest - and if you don't already own it the ""Favourite Piano Concertos, Vol 2"" set it certainly is terrific value. Just wish Philips could get some Decca engineers to come over and remaster them ..."
2,OK but Staier Herreweghe is much better,I was eager to get my hands on this (Schumann) performance but after listening to it I still favor (by a lot) the Schumann done by Staier and Herreweghe. The problem with the the Andsnes performance is not the piano playing but with the over-orchestration by the Berlin Philharmonic. They are overpowering (and overbearing) to the point of sounding like they're playing in the bottom of a tub filled with mud....this is supposed to be a delicate piano concerto not something Beethoven would have pounded out for his Emperor. Unfortunately the Staier is hard to find but once found you'll throw all of your other cd's of the work away..it is THE definitive performance if there ever was one. The performance is crystal clear with all the beautiful nuances of the orchestra exposed. If is a refreshing performance that I have listened to time and again. It (of my 500 classical cd collection) is maybe the best recording I have.
5,Really pumped about this.,"I've been looking all over for a way to transfer heating oil from my underground tank, down 6 feet or so, and tried a Harbor Freight rotary which did absolutely nothing. Also tried a few lever types to no avail. Didn't want to spend a ton on some kind of fancy electric pump, when I came across this baby. Dropped the hose down 7 feet, pumped a few times, ka-blooey, oil was gushing into my barrel at a good clip. Easy to operate, smooth action, no leaks, nice piece of work. Love it."
1,Piece of junk,"fuel washes the paint off of it, didn't even pump 200 gallons of fuel and it was leaking fuel, sucking air, and the paint is coming off."
4,Good Pump,"Once the pump is primed it delivers an enthusiastic squirt with each push of the handle. Care must be taken if using a filter funnel. It will easily splash the fuel overboard. My relief valve arrived defective and I had to ask for a replacement, which was promptly sent. If using in a polyethylene drum be aware that the pumping motion will want to rock the pump back and forth in the bung hole as you operate it. Excellent for gasolene."
4,Best Transfer Pump I Have Used,This is a really good fuel pump for the price. It is now the second one I have bought in the last 2 months and plan on getting 1 more...
3,"A Weak Follow-up to ""Fiorello!""","With a great score, but an inferior script, ""Tenderloin"" fails to succeed. Its script needs to be re-worked by Neil Simon, taking away the importance of the ""Tommy"" role and buffering up the role of Dr. Brock and his challenges. Perhaps a ""Gangs of New York"" atmosphere might help and Daniel Day Lewis in his first Broadway appearance might work."
4,A decent presentation tool... with some reservations...,"I have used this remote for a while now and it is excellent for what it does - run PowerPoint by remote control. The ""remote mouse"" feature is pretty much useless, but for just presentations - it's fine. I found that you have to remove the batteries from it when you store it in its case, because the on-off switch turns on pretty easily. I also keep a whole box of ""aa"" batteries in the projector case in case I forget...Plus:Easy to use - plug and play. I've let others use it and as long as they have Windows XP - it works very easily - just plug in the receiver and boot up!Bluetooth Range is incredibleLooks like a Star Trek PhaserMinus:Shutoff switchRemote mouse - worthlessBluetooth receiver does not work with any other Bluetooth deviceRemote does not appear to work with any other Bluetooth receiver, but I haven't tested extensively.Software overrides other mouse software - a minor problem if you use a regular mouse with your laptop."
5,To people who couldn't make it work with Mac,"Please make some effort first before writing a review. This works GREAT with Mac OS X. Yes the ""Back"" button (right) will not work out of the box. You need to:- Install Logitech software for OS X(comes with it)- Configure the right button for ""Keystroke"" and assign ""Arrow up"" or ""Page UP"" key to it.- Be in the mouse mode, not presentation mode.If you do that left and right buttons will work as supposed in Powerpoint slide show mode.Excellent product."
3,"You need ""something"" to get it work for your Mac.","I read the recent review from PowerBook G4 user and got confidence about the compatibility of this product. Now, I can't use the right button for backwarding a slide in my powerpoint presentation. Tried to install OS 9 MouseWare software came along with the product. It didn't work. I contacted technical support of Logitech, but they just simply said that this product is not compatible with Machintosh computer. Then, why they put that OS version MouseWare in their CD? Going back to the review that I read, what that user downloaded from the internet and could get it work? Did the right button work properly? You may want to check the review from Chile to see what I mean.Even though with this partial functionality, this device is really must-have item for anyone who wants to present in speedy and smooth way. That is why I am still trying to find any way to make it fully functional."
4,Good Product and Good Customer Service.,"I purchases this Thermos a couple years ago. It worked well. I picked up another used one at Goodwell without a stopper. I ordered a new stopper online and it was reasonably priced. It was a good thing I had a working spare because the first one lost it's vaccum. I could feel the hot or cold on the outside of the bottle. The product has a ""Life Time"" warranty against defects. I retuned the faulty unit and was sent a replacement immediately. Except for the inconvenience of getting a replacement, it has served me well and I would buy another.Thermos Nissan Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Bottle"
2,keeps coffee hot! Makes coffee taste like plastic :(,"I rate the thermal properties excellent. It keeps coffee hot all day. 24 hours later coffee was still warm. However, I bought this Thermos so I could bring great tasting coffee from home to avoid the less than desirable coffee at work. Unfortunately the thermos itself imparts a ""chemically"" test to the coffee. Just to be clear I don't mean after 24 hours, I mean the first cup tastes bad. I've repeatedly washed and rinsed the container. The taste is becoming less prominent but it's still there. Not sure why I'm the only one that has noticed this...Maybe mine is defective??"
5,Great Thermos,"I gave it to my son as a present, he loves it. It keeps coffee very hot for 12 hours. Great product."
3,Keeping It Hot!!,"We bought this as a back-up to a Thermos we bought years ago...and it is still going strong. This new one has a cheesy plastic style twist on plug - we'll see. We have used it once, it worked good, but we want to try the ""overnight"" test - make coffee about 8:00p.m. and then have it the next morning - like we're camping - that will be the best test. It is a nice looking container, and hopefully we will get many years of use. Oh, it sure would be the Stanley - what a major waste of money - no C/S to contact either."
1,Buy another product,"I bought this thermos to replace an identical one that was at least 15 years old and was beginning to look grungy (but still worked perfectly). This one looks almost identical and seemed like a great fit, until I noticed it leaked. It does not leak from the top, but from the sides where apparently the interior cylindar is leaking. I saw this same complaint from another purchaser, but just thought they had one defective item. Now I wish I had taken their advice. We dug the old one out of the trash and will be returning this one."
2,"It works, but materials are questionable","This product works, however I was disappointed to discover that it was manufactured in Communist China, where quality control, labor standards, and raw materials are questionable at best. I was under the erroneous impression that it would be made in Japan."
2,Thermos Nissan Stainless Steel - leaks,"The thermos is great at keeping coffee hot for hours. I started taking it to work and was loving it, until is started to leak. I rinsed it out daily to clean it and never used anything inside to clean it but when it is full, it leaks. So, if you like hot coffee that drips on you - you'll love this."
4,Good product,"This is a good product but I returned it as I ""assumed"" it had a wide mouth and it did not. My fault as it didn't say it had a wide mouth."
4,Still Crazy [Good] After All These Years,"I have had one of these for what seems like forever! 15 years? It's a great product, indestructible (remember when the glass lined thermos' would break? You would shake it around and hear all the glass tinkling?). Coffee is still warm the next day! And sometimes I will drink it. The only problem is cleaning, with the narrow mouth, it's all but impossible, without a toilet brush, to get inside. I'm not totally sure how much I care about that (actually I don't since I use it all the time and just rinse with water). I am a tough grader, so I give it a four."
3,More than you would ever want to know,"A very long and critical modern biography of Rhodes. The author choose to leave absolutely no detail of his life untold at great length. Most annoying is a pseudo-psycology approach of Rhodes as a product of intense love for his mother and a less than great relationship with his father. If you can get by all that, reading this will give you something of a contemporary understanding of the colonization of southern Africa and the relationship of Brits and Boers before and during the Anglo-Dutch war."
3,that it cpuld hav ebetter music in it.,"personaly i think it could be better because i'm only teenager what do you ecept from me but it is good but me i don't really listen to it, why do you have to have so many words well this all i can write."
4,Legacy Trilogy not on Kindle,"Had to get the Legacy Trilogy in paperback format because they are not available in Kindle format. The trilogy before and after are, but not this one. Apparently it is available in the competing electronic format. Not complaining about the books, they are great."
3,OK but no Hertiage,"The Heritage Legacy books were definitely better. This was ok for a plane ride but no ""can't put it down"" book"
4,Quirky and interesting.,"While the Cathy Gale episodes of the Avengers suffer somewhat from having to be reconstructed from ancient videotapes, they still are well worth viewing. Steed is younger, and much more ruthless, and he is well-matched by the tough, independent Cathy."
4,the avengers '64 set 1,Sorry to report that this item is not as described when I purchased it. I was expecting dvd format but received vhs instead.
4,Peel's first year,Honor Blackman's last season as Patrick MacNee's crime fighting companion. Mrs.Gale and John Steed foil ecentric criminals through six episiodes. The charaacters remain unflappable throughout in the way we have come to expect form Her Majesty's servants (at least that's what they appear to be- their offical capacity is never really stated). Lots of fun and well written.
3,"Very Comfortable, But Slides Down In My Shoes","I bought these a few days ago at CVS drugstore, and though I really do like them I am unhappy with how they slide down in my shoes. When they slide down a half inch in my shoes then I'm not getting the arch support I need and my feet then hurt (a lot). I even tried to keep them in place with strong 2 inch wide double stick tape, and still have the problem as the tape won't stick to the gel insoles. I then tried using the tape to tape the top of the insole to the shoe, but then I feel the tape against my foot, and, when the insole slides down a little anyway then there is a ridge of tape that is definately uncomfortable on my feet. I hope I can find some way to keep them in place; otherwise I probably won't keep using them.Also, I don't think the arch support is very 'supportive': it's barely there."
2,A bit disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed when I received this product. It reads ""fits women's sizes 5-10"" however this gel support is very bulky and didn't fit in the majority of my shoes. I ended up giving them to my husband."
2,not worth the money,"Good idea on these supports, but the gel seems to ooze at the edges with repeated wear. would not buy again."
5,very good toy for children,I am very satisfied with the product. It is really good for the imagination for children.
3,"I liked it,but the format was terrible","Very good book, I deeply agree with the author's theory about why we are in the mess we are in; however, the paragraph structure is just awful. It all runs together and this can be an headache for someone like me, who has bad eyesight!"
4,motorcycle camping made easy,good basic knodledege. lots of pictures. a quick read and good for use as refrence. the lists of manufacters was helpful.
4,2 Wheeled Camping,I really enjoyed this book. It help me with questions I had concerning camping on my bike. Cut the trail & error part of the lerning curve. I would recomend this book to anyone looking in to this subject.
2,Motorcycle Camping Made Easy,Was not exactly what I was looking for. Information in this book was already known to me.
1,"Stupid book, motorcycle camping.",My husband hated this book. He said the book is not written well and the ideas projected in this book are not realistically useable.
3,Not bad if you don't know how to camp,I can't say this is a useless book.It's fairly well writen and covers the basics of camping.My complaint is that at least 3/4 the book coversthe basics of camping and camping gear not specific tomotorcycle camping. If you have NOT gone camping beforeand you want a book that covers both the basics of campingand motorcycling in one book then you might be happy with this.If you already know how to camp then you might be disappointed.There are some useful contact resources for motorcycle clubsand campgrounds and motocycle specific gear.
1,silly simple,"If you have ever spent one night camping in a tent in your back yard, you know as much about camping as this author. There are no special insights offered...nothing that makes you say, ""Wow. Why didn't I think of that?!"" Buy a Boy Scout manual and you're way ahead of this silly book."
2,A bit much,"I have been camping with a motorcycle for well over 30 years and found the information in this book to be great if you are pulling a trailer or have a chase vehicle other than a two wheeler. The longest I spent on ""the road"" was 3 weeks and was comfortable with carrying a lot less gear than the author suggests. There was some useful information in the book."
3,Motorcycle Camping Made Easy,"The book has a lot of good ideas you may not have thought about. Lots of good information and it gets you thinking about you're needs. Some good reviews about all aspects of camping on a motorcycle, tents, sleeping mat, sleeping bags and packing ideas, and lists that may help you at trip time."
5,Motorcycle Camping Made Easy,"I would recommend this book to anyone who looking into motorcycle camping. I found it to be interesting and informative, well worth the read. If you are a seasoned camper you might find it a little basic, but it was just what I was looking for. I haven't camped out for many years and was looking for a refresher course, and it filled the bill nicely."
1,black & white & Low res,"if you click ""look inside"" they show full color imagesshameless cheat - amazon.com must better remove this item out !!!!!!!it just black & white printed, no color (all pages inside)and product pictures are low resolutionall pages look like photocopy(on-demand publishing)too expensive to pay"
3,A MUCH IMPROVED KYLIE!,"Whilst Kylie may not be the greatest singer in the world, she has indeed made some fairly memroable recordings. This third album in her catologue matured from those of her previous two teeny pop albums, KYLIE (1988) and ENJOY YOURSELF (1990) and BETTER THE DEVIL YOU KNOW is by far one of her very best efforts to date. The tracks are all instantly hummable and highlights include, STEP BACK IN TIME, SHOCKED (a far superior version is featured on this album then that of the bland remix it received when lifted as a single), THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER and ONE BOY GIRL. Certainly not brilliant but is worth a listen and as i said before, has far more depth and character than her previous two albums to this point. On the whole quite good with a few exceptionally really great songs."
2,Kylie ' s Rhythm,"I 've already have this album on record format ,I don 't think is one of the best of hers.Only the songs ,that realesed as singles worth hearing ,If you buy the greatest hits album you will have these singles.The only difference is the version of "" socked "" ,which is a bit longer than greatest hits ( doesn ' t include the rap part )."
5,A comforting read for winter,This is a beautiful book with diverse feelings about winter and its effects on people and the landscape; enjoyable to read. I go back to it and read it again. The true measure of a good book for me.
5,A Cornucopia of Silver/Gray Moods,"This is a collection of stories and meditations about or involving wintertime, a season where we shelter indoors by a warm hearth from a bleak outer world and, in doing so, reflect within on thoughts of past and future times. It's also the period where we enjoy the fruits of summer's diligent gathering, or starve in shivering misery.Arranged in sections by theme, this diverse collection evokes many moods of winter for warm hearthside meditations or cool summer escapism. It also serves as a good sampler introducing the work of many wonderful authors for further reading."
5,"Great Pads, No Noise",I've run multiple sets of these pads on a Z06 Corvette and have had no squeaking noises at all. They are a bit dirty under very hard conditions (running on a road course) but that is to be expected.Thumbs up!
4,durable design,"This item was ordered from the site on the web. It showed measurements in increments not accustomed to, and when it arrived, it was about big enough for a cell phone, my bad."
2,RunSkipShop Shipped Older Version,"Camera bag NOT AS PICTURED. RunSkipShop shipped me an older version of the Tamrac 5680. If you want the newer (better) version, don't buy it from them."
1,Not Durable,"I'm currently looking for another crate pan for my dogs wire Midwest crate. The plastic pan is not durable at all. The first crack appeared when my dog (Boxer) was only 5 months old. Now she is 18 months and the pan has several cracks in it. Luckily she doesn't have any accidents while being crated!! I'm just now replacing it because the local pet stores in my area, including Petsmart, doesn't carry them in their store. I'm told everywhere I go to check online. In my opinion the crate pans are way too expensive to have to keep replacing them."
1,Low quality,"Cleaned the pan on a sunny weekend in the backyard. Left it in the grass to dry. Came back an hour or so later to a warped, buckled pan. Lovely! Now it won't fit into the crate and can no longer be used. Such high quality."
2,Didn't survive the angry Weimaraner,Had it like four monts and it developed a crack then promply disentigrated and had to be replace within 8 months...
1,less than fluff,"In the past 8 weeks I've read the following books in addition to the title reviewed here:The Biotech Investors Bible (superb!)Instant Biology (outstanding! amazing!)from ALCHEMY to IPO (decent)The Biotech Age is reminscent of 3rd grade textbooks.I really wouldn't call this collection of printed typea book. A professor from Vanderbilt who has little insightfulinformation -- you'd be better off reading randon articleson lifesciences from the Internet. OK, to this pointI've berrated the book and the author. All I can sayis that there simply wasn't much in the book. I can'tsay I learned anything from this guy and yet I learnedso much from the other books."
1,Bereft of Content,"The book brushes but does not paint and is written on an 8th grade level. Buy it for your young children if they are interested in the business or promise of biotech. A much better book is, The Biotech Investor's Bible by Wolfe."
5,Excellent overview from a business standpoint,"This is a thorough, well-researched guide to the future of biotech as much as the present. Much of what was predicted in this book (at the beginning of 2000--when Internet fever was at its height) is already coming true. Biotech is indeed replacing information technology as an engine of growth and the cycle is just getting started. This is not an investment guide, but it shows why everyone should have part of their portfolio in this sector. More importantly, it shows that we will reach a point in the future where biotech developments will impact not only our health, but also the state of world hunger, the way we manufacture products, and the way we clean up pollution. If you're interested in biotech from a business angle, rather than a scientific one, this is a great source."
3,LOOKING FOR A GOOD BIOTECH BOOK,"I'm hoping someone can help. I'm looking for a good book regarding cutting-edge genetic and biotechnology research. I'm primarily interested in a 'big picture' view of what's to come over the next 1-2 decades, especially from an investment perspective. Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated!rrurban1@aol.com Rob Urban"
2,Not helpful for us,"I have a 6yo and we have tried to use this dictionary whenever she asks the ""What does ____ mean?"". So far not one of the words she has asked about has been in there and I have owned it for over a year! I think it is great for just leizure reading and discovery of a 5-7yo but for a true elementary dictionary it does not have enough words or depth."
2,Not up to my expectations,"I bought this book because of the rating by another person, and the name Webster. Once my daughter (she's 6 years old)got the book, she read it and really enjoyed reading it. The only thing is when it was time to write the definitions for her spelling words, she struggled because the definitions aren't clear, they have sentences describing words, not clear definitions. Words like every, shall, etc., are not listed in this book and the definitions used in this book are merely sentences that describes the words. I personally didn't like it at least not for my 6 year old."
5,A dictionary for children,"This dictionary is perfect for a young child, especally a child with English as a second language. The pictures are colorful and life-like. The words and definations are easy to read."
5,"Yes, it IS the Sandpipers, just not the same ones you're thinking of","The Sandpipers were a vocal singing group that started in the late 1940's many years before the ""Guantanamera"" Sandpipers. These singers, which appeared on the Golden children's record label included Anne Lloyd, Mike Stewart, Ralph Nyland, Dick Byron and Bob Miller and were directed by Mitch Miller, years before his ""sing along"" fame. But here is the twist -- amazon incorrectly list the Golden Sandpipers as being on this album, when in fact that is not true. Actually it is a later vocal group sometimes called The Golden Singers or The Glow Tones, directed by Jim Timmens. One of their vocalists is Rose Marie Jun, who did loads of commericial jingles and Broadway demos for composers. This album is a studio version of BABES IN TOYLAND made in the early 60's, not a soundtrack. I have submitted these changes to amazon so hopefully when you read this there will be no errors."
4,Very good basic information on garter snake care,"A book on the captive care of garter snakes for beginners has been badly needed for quite some time, and this excellent little book fills that need very nicely indeed. While it does not provide the level of information that serious garter snake hobbyists would like, and could be more precise in terms of diet and the unique requirements of some species, that sort of detail would be inappropriate in a beginner's guide like this one. It sets out the basic requirements (feeding, caging, health) that any snake keeper just starting out is going to need to know. I breed garter snakes myself and am very happy that I can now refer my customers, particularly the younger ones, to a book that answers so many of their questions."
2,Could have done without,"I read this book in seminary. I can't remember much of anything about it except that it was irritating for me to read. I am an out and out conservative theologically and I hold to the Bible and I tend to not like the irreverence I sense from some liberal views of the Bible which this book attempts to lay out many ideas and ""scholarly"" information about the background of the Pastoral Epistles. It was not fun to read through and I can't say I got anything out of it. Wouldn't recommend.But, I can't say I have another recommendation to get background information on the Pastorals, but I hope you can find something better."
2,Cargo Carrier,"I received my shipment promptly, however, all of the necessary hardware was missing, which I purchased locally.Overall, the carrier serves its intended purpose, but the tray is two -peice and very flimsy, in fact, mine came cracked, and the mounting bracket is quite low quality.Okay, if you're not looking for a very high quality unit."
4,ALMOND PASTE,My husband and grandkids alike love the cookies I make with this paste. I have to keep my children (8) out of them so there is some for the rest. Just kidding but everyone loves them.
4,Nice Remote meat and chamber thermometer,Does a good job of monitoring heat in chamber and meat. Remote part is really nice. Be carefull not to expose cables to direct flame as they will stop working and you will have to purchase another set.
1,150 in Tepid Water,"Simply, this fellow does not work consistently. I was unsure of it's accuracy, so I put the probe into warm water (roughly 100 degrees) and I get a measurement of 150. Um...no.I may have lemon--not sure, but I am sure that tepid water is not 150 degrees (nor is the ambient air, which the probe is now measuring at 152...again, um, no.)I'll see what I can do w/ the company/Amazon, but the unit I received fails in it's only real duty."
1,Handy but useless,"I've been using this thermometer for about 8 months now, thinking it was pretty decent for the price. I love the fact that it's wireless and has an audible alarm for a set temperature. The stand on the display unit is also nice. BUT...Big problemI just checked the thermometer against my other digital thermometer. This one read over 10 degrees warmer than the other two (which were the same, 0.5F) at warm tap water temps. It seems the hotter the temperature, the more this thermometer is off. It would explain why my 165F chicken was still looking a little pink. With no option to calibrate, you're out of luck unless you come up with a handy spreadsheet to equate the read temperature to the real temp, but even that requires another working thermometer.The only thing this thermometer is good for is the trash."
4,It actually works as advertised !,"Very happy with this unit. For the price, you can't beat it. I wanted another brand that I had heard was one of the best but no one had it in stock so I found this little gem. Took my temperature with it as soon as I put the batteries in just to see how accurate it was - it gave an accurate reading. I like the feature of being able to monitor the food temperature while it is cooking. If you cook on the grill frequently this is a must have. I haven't used it much as I just recieved it a week ago it but so far, I'm very pleased."
5,Great Product,This is wonderful thermometer. I have a Treager Grill and with this thermometer my cooking has improved tremendously.It is very accurate. If you are into outdoor grilling this is the product for you.
4,RediCheck Remote meat thermometer,"Gives actual temp on the remote and not on the trasmitting unit. I can seem both the ""set temp"" and the ""meat temp"" at any time during cooking. The last one I had was not RediCheck and would not tell me the temp. It only beeped when the temp was a certain number of degrees away from the set temp. That sounds helpful but knowing the temp and seeing how fast it is moving is much more helpful, since I cook anything from chops to large roasts which vary in thickness. Also the probe is covered with metal sheath not plastic like some models. Clips are the only weak item. Wish it had a magnet or stronger clips. Arrived on time as stated and is working well."
2,Avoid,"Ok.. where to start on this one, first off on day one I received the thermometer the probe was DOA, all I was getting was an error anytime I tried to use it. Now they back order these probes, so it took me 2 MONTHS to get a new one. And yes, at first I was very happy, but after a while I started realizing that it's not giving me the proper temps, and there's no convinent button to press that automatically gives you the current temp. There's a tiny one on the back that requires a pen to press, but that's no good. So it updates it's temp every few seconds, but sometimes it wouldn't so what your reading on screen could be completely different from what it actually is. So I don't use it anymore, because it does not provide quick accurate information."
5,BBQ Remote,Purchased two of these some time ago and finally got around to using it. How have I been BBQing without this for so long? Easy to use and the remote operation kept me away from the smoker until the alarm went off. Perfect BBQ. Highly recommend for the serious backyard BBQ chefs!
1,Junk!!!,This is cheap junk. Don't bother buying this crap. Worked once. Receiver will not register food temperature after only one use. I've done all the trouble shooting I know how. I've looked online to see if there was any information but there is nothing that I haven't already tried. I did not abuse this in anyway. It still looks new because it IS new. Just a bad product.
1,Died after Six Months,"Tried to find one of these that would last. I'm still looking. This one worked for Christmas dinner and several meals before that but today died. By died I mean giving erroneous readings that bounce all over the place: 132 to 406 to 232 to HHH. Closed both ends down, repositioned the probe and started over. No luck. Very disappointed."
2,Doesn't read temp,"This item has been hit or miss. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Has been more frustrating than anything and by the time I figured it out, it was outside the return policy... great idea, bad execution."
3,Re-check meat temp,I looked forward to getting this thermometer to save time running in and out while smoking meat. I have found that the internal temp of the meat doesn't really register correctly and I have to use a hand held meat thermometer to get a true reading. I'll be giving this one away and get a better one that gives true temps.
2,Hit or miss; great when it works,"It's true you get what you pay for. This thing rocked for the first 4 hours of a brisket smoke; it froze up on me after that. Couldn't get it working until I took the batteries out and put them back in. Happened again with smoking some chicken thighs a week later, and everything else I've used to cook it with. If I could, I would return it. It gets the 2 stars cause I know how to get it working again, and thus, I don't end up over cooking my food."
2,Not too reliable.,"I have used this for one year. It is very difficult to get to broadcast to the remote. I keep thinking it is the batteries, so I replace them and the transmitter still cannot reach the receiver. Not a good investment."
2,Amazingly poor design,"I'm beginning to lose faith in Amazon reviews as this thing has quite a few good ones, but I found it to be really badly designed. What do you do with a digital thermometer every time you use it? You turn it on. This thing has *microscopic* on/off buttons...on the back! And then there is the setup routine. I have to go find the printed instructions every time. Why not print the instructions right on both units? And not in 2pt font! Mine stopped taking the temperature after only four uses. It syncs up, shows the temp, and then sits there and the temp never changes. It is really clumsy as a replacement for the simple ""pen"" style ones for use in the kitchen. And the beep....oh, the beep. Why must things beep?! It wakes the neighbors. Unbelievable. If you buy one just remember: you only have 30 days to get a full refund."
1,Broken on arrival,"The thermometer was defective on arrival. I dutifully inserted the batteries as instructed and then tried to register or sync the thermometer with the monitor but it kept failing to register the temperature. The temperature kept reading ""HHH"" or ""too hot to read."" I repeated the attempt multiple times but kept getting the same reading. According to the manual, this indicates that there is a ""short"" in the circuit and damage to the product.I promptly returned the product. It's a shame because the product sounds so good."
2,Works well but batteries are a pain to change,"This Thermometer combo works well, but has the flaw of needing a screwdriver to change the batteries. This is a pain in the butt when you are trying to keep track of something on the grill and the batteries need to be changed! It is an additional step that has left it laying dead in the drawer."
3,Worked well for about 5 months,"I'm a busy home cook, especially around Thanksgiving, so I liked the idea of a remote receiver that I could clip to my pocket while the turkey cooked. It worked well, although I kept coming into the kitchen to check the bird anyway...just in case! The meat thermometer was reliable for about 5 months, until I accidentally dropped the transmitter on the deck while attempting to remove the probe from some grilled chicken on Mother's Day. Now the transmitter blinks as if it's transmitting, but I'm not getting a temperature read on the receiver. I'll contact RediCheck to see if they'll spot me a new probe. If not, I'll probably replace this thermometer with an instant read thermometer. I'm finding I don't use the remote feature enough to justify the extra drawer space that this product requires."
1,No stars,"This RediCheck was terrible and I ended up returning it. It worked for about 10 minutes and then failed to communicate with the sending unit at all.. Would beep work for about 2 sec, then nothing... I gave up on it and ordered a better product. All in all, I bought it for the price and ended up getting what I paid for I guess."
3,Pretty good unit,Syncing to read remote temp is not very intuitive and the overall range is limited to maybe 100 feet. Unit works pretty well and the temperature readings were accurate.
5,good thermometer,I've had it for over a year. I use it all the time. I've never had a problem with it. Would definitely recommend!
4,Works pretty well,"Range at my location is about 50 to possibly 75 feet. Also, don't forget to turn it off when not in use as it will drain the batteries quite fast. Does a decent job."
4,Remote thermometer,Works great. only 2 buttons. Simple and very easy to work with. Rated 4 because of the 4 small screws you have to remove to change the battery.
3,Tracks listed are incorrect,"The tracks listed above are not all included on the CD. Even the links to audio clips play unexpected songs. Specificially, tracks 3,5,10,11,13,17 and 18 are not on this CD, That's Van Morrison, Otis Redding, John Lennon, etc. The CD Box set also is missing these tracks."
1,AMAZON RIPS US OFF YET AGAIN!!,"I would like to second the comments of another reviewer! The CD you get when you order this disc from Amazon does not contain the advertised tracks. I also now have TWO of them, thanks to the incompetent Amazon employee who did not carefully read my complaint either. Neither disc contains the Van Morrison tracks nor the Lulu track, ""Cry Me a River."" Other discrepencies too numerous to list also exist. This is false advertising in my book and I hope won't end up paying for either disc. I think this is a good example of how Amazon feedback is worthless. There is NO communication, only boilerplate responses that are irrelevant!"
3,Uneven offering,"I bought this album after hearing a few cuts on the online radio station Pandora. I was mainly interested in the collaborations of Jeff Beck with Tom Jones (yes, that Tom Jones) and Lulu. These are first rate cuts. The rest of the package is uneven at best."
4,Blues via the UK,"There are some great performances here from American artists that impacted the blues scene of the UK as well as the UK's Clapton and Mayall, but the real thrill here is brand new material from Jeff Beck and his performances with Tom Jones and Lulu. Jones and Lulu both give inspired performances of some contemporary American blues classics and JB is his usual twisted self wringing every bit of blues out of every note he plays. Someone should convince Jeff and Tom to tour together because this tease is barely enough. I've got to buy the DVD."
1,Wrong track listing!,"The track listing is wrong! No John Lennon, Otis Redding or Van Morrison. While the remaining music is still great, do not purchase this disc if you want to hear the tracks from the above mentioned artists."
2,Meh. Kinda' boring.,"It is hard to give this a review as I kept falling asleep watching it. Not sure how other people feel but it was boring to me. Since this review has to be 20 words or more, I'll just blather on to fill the required space."
4,A young actress makes this film simply enjoyable,"I only saw the second half of the movie, and that should be a statement for itself. The woman name is Angela Gots. She has just made my day. At first I was amused by her beauty, but in a matter of minutes discovered that there's definitely more to her. her subtle facial expressions were truly impressive and the fact that she had no fear is even more."
4,Long Live Dark Shadows,"I loved Angelique. She was played as I always thought she should be. Dark, mysterious, and intriguing. I too was upset when they killed the series. I vote we petition NBC anc CBS to recast the series. At least so we can record it for postarity."
3,Good camera for the price,"I purchased the camera last xmas and took few pics indoor and outdoor. The pics outdoor came out fine, some of the indoor ones came out very dark. You need a very bright setting for indoor pics to come out good. Overall the camera is fine for the price I paid, I can take it every where I go because of the light weight and small size, and it looks very neat. I also like that battery charges automatically while you download pics to the PC instead of having to replace batteries. Downloading pics is very easy, just plug in the USB cable to the computer. But again if quality is your main goal, this is not the camera for you."
1,Terrible Picture Quality,"If you plan on taking pictures indoors with this camera, save yourself the hassle of returning it and run away now. This camera has no flash, and therefore all indoor pictures are dark, blurry and terribly out of focus. Stay away."
4,Great for what it is.,"Anyone who doesn't like this camera doesn't understand what it's intended to do; it's not a $700 digital. The pictures are not perfect, but it's a fun little camera that takes fun pictures (excellent for parties if there's enough light) and, yes, they do come out pretty well. The MGI software is ok, but I still prefer my Photoshop."
4,"Small, Sleek Cool.","This small Logitech Pocket Digital Camera is perfect for uploading and sneding images in email, or putting images on your webstie. Its small size can fit almost anywhere. There is no LCD display, which means you cannot see the image until you upload it to your PC. This camera is perfect for what I do, upload images to my website. Do not expect to get high-quality prints from this digital camera. If you want printed images that look nice, look elsewhere. But, if its small prints you want, or a camera that uploads pictures to the web, this is the camera for you."
1,Disappointing Digital Camera,"I recently purchased this camera and was very disappointed. I am hoping to return it. The photos come out with a greenish haze and are not very focused. I tried photos inside, outside and in my office and they all turned out the same. I also had difficulty installing the camera on my HP tower. I contacted Logitech support and it took 2 days for the first reply which was that i needed to call in from 7am to 5pm PST. Those are my work hours. When I responded this was not satisfactory, I got an email with instructions that I finally was able to get the camera installed.You get what you pay for. A disposable camera with 35mm film takes way better photos."
3,As kid friendly as it can get,"This camera is perfect for kids. With only three buttons (shutter, hi/low resolution, sound on/off+self-timer) it is very easy to use. The Windows-XP software is also easy to use: plug in camera to USB port, press download button and pictures are transfered and deleted from the camera. The camera uses the USB port to charge the battery. My 6 year old daughter can take pictures and download them without any help. It was also a big hit at show-and-tell.Daylight photos are good enough for kids."
1,Poor picture quality,"i bought this pocket logitec camera for 50 and at first i loved it. the sleek slim credit card designe meant i could take it anywhere unlike a big camera is recognisable. anyway i took pictures and some came out well and few came out reaaly awful. after a few hundred shots, on the camera screen it displayed ""e9"" message and it wont work any more. i pressed all the available buttons, read the manual and it still said the same message. the camera froze out of the blue and it just would not work any more. i think it was a waste of money for me to buy this. a few extra money would've bought me a better reliable and lasting camera. if you can help my problem please email me at: ..."
2,"Cute, but not Competent","First of all, any mention of 1.3 megapixel on the box is effective lying. Sure, the camera can produce 1.3 mp images, but only by internally transforming 640x480 to 1280x960. lemme repeat this, this camera only takes 640x480 (350kpixel) pictures. I was not satisfied with the quality of the upsampled pictures. Also forget about using this indoors. The slow shutter speed and lack of a flash will make every picture a dark, blurry mess. On the good side, the Pocket Digital is truly slim and light, and easily rides in any pocket. The aluminum case protects the lens and electronics well. After deciding I didn't want to deal with the poor performance of this camera, I returned it and bought a Pocket digital 130."
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy this camera. Pictures are fuzzy, and since there is not a flash, you need really good lighting. This is not worth $1. Don't waste your time or money"
2,no not quite good as it seems,its very portable but its just too dang blurry when u take the pictures. and the camera feels like it wont last more than 6 months of use with it
1,Its not up to the Logitech name,I bought it and am returning it todayCome-on Logitech you can do better. Poor picture quality is inexcusable
1,What a disappointment,"I got this camera to enable me to take quick pictures for use on websites. I was not looking for amazing quality, but the images produced by this camera were absoulutey atrocious. I think it is one of the coolest looking of my toys, but other than a conversation piece, it is worthless. 1.3 megapixels... the quality was so very disappointing. And i was SO EXCITED TOO!!"
1,bogus,I bought three of these cameras. The first one was lost when it fell out of my husband's pocket while he was trail riding. The second was lost when it fell out of my husbands truck while he was on a trip. The last one had a problem with the battery not charging. This is when we found out that the camera had an internal battery that was not replacable.I e-mailed the company and they told me to call the company. I called and called and was never able to get through. I then called the sales branch of the company and he told me that the best time to call was 7:00 am my time before the rush. While this was quite awhile ago. I never did get through to anyone. And I have a worthless camera that was used for less than 6 month.My advice to anyone looking at this camera is to run the other way.
1,Dead battery,I can no longer charge the battery. And there is no apparent way to change the battery. This is a piece of junk! Logitech should take it off the market.
2,1.3 MEGAPIXELS IS VERY MISLEADING...BEWARE!...,"This item is advertised as 1.3 MP. Very misleading. When you measure pixels the TRUE measurement is the CMOS sensor resolution. For this camera, the CMOS sensor resolution is ONLY .35 MP. Yes, that is right -- .35 --. The 1.3 MP this camera markets on the outside of the box is INTERPOLATED pixelization -- this is an algorithimic method of ""blowing up"" or ""magnifying"" the image -- often making the image look very pixelated. For a small pocket sized inexpensive digital camera with TRUE CMOS sensor resolution, look to the Aiptek PenCam SD 1.3-Megapixel Digital Camera. This is actually cheaper priced, allows you to take video, and has a memory expansion slot. By the way, if your batteries run out, you can replace them -- unlike with the Logitech which comes with rechargeables BUILT IN -- guess you have to throw the camera away when it stops holding a charge?!"
3,"Not really 1.3 megapixels, but simple and convenient","If you want a camera to take VGA quality pictures that you can carry easily in your pocket, this is a good choice. I had researched this camera long before it came out, and was excited that it purported to have 1.3 megapixel resolution, but after I bought it and read some more reviews I found the fine print saying the 1.3 megapixel resolution is ""interpolated"" from native VGA resolution (VGA is 640x480 pixels, or about .31 megapixels). All that means is that the camera ""dithers"" or basically breaks up the captured pixels into more pixels, which doesn't really do much to improve picture quality. Despite that disappointment and my view that the advertised quality is very misleading, I kept this camera because it does what I wanted -- it lets me very easily carry around a camera that takes pictures in daylight that are good enough to e-mail. If that's all you want, and the price is acceptable, you'll be happy with this camera."
4,Not a bad camera after you learn it...,"It's not a bad camera after you get the hang of it. When you first use it, pictures might turn out blurry or jagged indoors or outdoors, but after a lil practice you'll get it. Main thing is holding the camera steady. Don't jiggle the camera when pushing the picture capture button and all the jaggedness will go away =)Not too bad of a quality either. 640x480 resolution but it's quite handy =)"
3,Handy pocket cam.,"I bought mine because I can keep it in a tiny side pocket of my purse, and it is virtually weightless. I have dropped it (lots), SAT on it, forgot and left it in the hot car, and had it banging around in the bottom of a pack. It always survives and takes beautiful scenic pics. Not much on action (no surprise), but when you wish you had something for that great sunset, there it is. Lower your expectations a little, and it's a nice little cam for the money. And never a dead battery!"
3,"Size matters, and small is a good thing","So you're thinking about buying a new digital camera, something to take pictures of the family and friends...maybe print them out to look at later...well then the Logitech Pocket Digital is NOT for you! It really is a pretty cool little camera (emphysis on little...2""x3.25""x0.4"" or 5.7x8.8x 1.2cm for you metric folks). It's a great little camera for taking pictures of all those wacky things you just wish you had a camera for...however, don't expect it to be taking award-winning pictures for the family photo album. It may have a small and large picture setting, but the camera really only takes pics in 640x480 format (the larger setting only expands the 640x480 into a larger, blurrier picture). One hint: get it on sale (like I did), its not worth the $99 Logitech would have you pay."
2,Quality not included,"Great in portability and looks, but severely lacking in Image quality.What good is a camera that fails in its primary role of capturing the precious moments of your life?It's a cool looking gadget, but albeit a useless one. I've owned 5 digital cameras and this one wins the WORST BANG for the BUCK award.If, however, the price came down... it would be an entirely different matter..."
1,What a waste of money!,"This logitech camera does not seem to live its reputation of 1.3 megapixels. I took many pictures and found out that this camera is best used for scenery pictures, not close-ups... i.d faces of people. Overall, pictures of this logitech camera produces mediocre results. Results making the eye strain just trying to figure it out. Save the money and buy a better name brand digital camera."
1,Worthless Pictures,"I got this camera and tried it out a couple times, in varying light conditions, and every time the pictures were worthless--you could hardly tell what they were of! When the object of the picture was a person you could barely tell who they were, and everything was terribly blurry. I was so disappointed with this camera and had to return it--save yourself the frustration and get a better camera!"
1,pocket digital,the camera is extremely small and light. how ever the shutter time is extremely slow so every picture is blurred. also the level of noise in the pictures is unacceptable. i am very dissapointed. i would recommend putting down money on a better camera.
1,Useless,"Sure, it looks sleek and pretty, and weighs nothing, but this camera can BARELY take a picture. Unless you have near perfect lighting conditions for professional circumstances, the most you will get is a couple of dark blotches. Even then, your're lucky if the pictures look like they've been ripped off of a security camera. I purchased one for the casual snapshot with friends, thinking I didn't want anything big or expensive, just to carry around. It's not even capable of fulfilling that duty poorly."
4,Great gift for a child's first camera!,"My ex bought this camera for my daughter who is 13 and promised if she could take care of it he would buy her a higher end camera. She's had it for a year now and it goes everywhere with her. It's great to take to school outings with her friends, to the beach, or anywhere else she wants to go. You have to be in very bright light for it to work, but you can't beat the portability. The quality is good enough for her and she posts pics on her MySpace all day long! LOL If you don't want to spend tons of money the first time out for your kids, this is a great option! It holds up to around 50 pics at a time!"
4,"Singer writes the ultimate story, a must read for all.","To those who might have dismissed Isaac B. Singer because he is perceived to be a ""Jewish"" writer writing about ""Jewish themes"", I ask them to please read this book. The theme of the novel encompasses all aspects of human behavior and develops the omnipresent theme of ambivalence of action in making a decision. The book can be read in no more than two days, so put it to the top of your summer reading list."
5,Pilates for Upper Body,"I was surprised by this workout , I actually like it! I usually find Stott Workouts too boring but it was refreshing using 2 weighted balls in a pilates routine.Moira instructs 3 students who perform the exercises in different levels, they use the balls in every single exercise , even in pushups when you put one ball between your calves and one between your knees while doing them, by the end of the workout I was really sweating and feeling fatigued in the upper body but I don't weight train at all(I just do pilates & yoga) so for people who do, it might be easy.I use 2.2 pound (1kg) balls I bought at a local store , not the stott balls (it doesn't really matter).The workout is 40 min. Stott Pilates have another toning ball workout called ""Amazing Tone"" & according to them theyre very similar except this one have a few extra exercises and supposed to be for ""teachers"" and ""avid home exercises "" so don't buy both of them."
5,Stott Toning Ball Workout,"Although this 42-minute workout did not produce a sweat for me, it did exhaust upper body muscles I didn't realize I had! As a result of using the Stott Pilates Toning Ball Workout for just a month, I've noticed a dramatic improvement in my posture, my arms and upper back, so the two and a half lb weighted balls used with the gentle movements of Stott Pilates is an outstanding combination. Moira uses the ""shell stretch"" after each exercise that includes reverse spinal flexion, which protects the back and the abdominals from injury, thus ensuring a safe and effective workout. I find her expert guidance and constant attention to her students' correct positioning extremely helpful in that I don't have to always look at them in order to understand what to do. That said, I highly recommend the Stott Pilates Toning Ball Workout."
2,manhattan conspiracy; blood on the apple,wouldn't recommend this book. it was not well written and what part had to do with manhattan seemed like an after thought.
4,"Mellow, night time, jazzy blues instrumentals","Ronnie Earl is a really great guitar player - always tasteful, always precise, yet not at all mechanical sounding. This is a terrific example of what he's capable of producing with just a small combo. The material runs the gamut from straight mellow blues to uptempo jazz blowing, although I suspect only guitar players will find it an album to listen to intently. For others, it's a great disc to have in the changer for your next intimate late night party. Note to Ronnie: if this had a few vocals by Kim Wilson or Sugar Ray Norcia on it, I think it would have been perfect."
3,I'd like to be more generous...,"... but to my ears, Vivica Genaux is not a vocal star of the first magnitude, as her enthusiastic fans seem to feel, and although she has some of the gifts to be a star of second magnitude brightness, there are serious flaws in her technical spectrum. An earlier critical reviewer expressed the opinion that she should stick to the Baroque repertoire, since her voice wasn't 'big' enough for Rossini. I confess that I was thinking exactly the opposite, after hearing her ""Arias for Farinelli,"" that she ought to seek a niche in the 19th C repertoire. Now it seems that she really does fall in the crack between. Her vibrato is too unacceptably constant for baroque, and her presence is too small for romantic. It doesn't help her case that I've heard all the arias on this Bel Canto CD sung by the greatest sopranos of the 20th C. Going head-to-head with von Stade on a selection from La Cenerentola is clearly a tactical blunder."
1,Worst movie ever,"It's a chick flick, and yeah, my 13 yrs old wanted to see it, she hated it too, it's just a dumb story, it's fantasy. If I could I would give it - 16 stars to bring the whole review down to zero where it should be. Who ever reviewed this and give it more then 1 star has issues."
5,Bella Mafia is a hit!!!,This is a must see movie. I am not into watching Mafia movies but this is really a great movie. The plot is awesome and the actors are great. It was so good that I am going to buy the book. Watch This movie!!
2,Warning,"Beware if you are ordering this product from outside of USA. I am in NZ and had issues with customs as it looks like a Asian copy and not an original studio release.That said, this is still a great movie and a nice change from the male dominated mob movies."
4,Edited for DVD....,"I love Vanessa Redgrave, so I'd watch anything she is in, which got me to this made for TV mini-series. This imported DVD version is the only available version. (There was a video edition...). The DVD looks and sounds great, and the film is highly entertaining, but it is odd that with the popularity of Mob films, and the star power in this one, that no American studio has issued the complete version....This one is missing about 35 minutes...."
4,A new outlook on the Godfather-formula.,"A unique new idea in the Mafia crime-movie. Four women, stripped of their manfolk start a vendetta of their own. The female in the crimestory seems finally to have come of age. Good acting by al the leads, especially Kinski, Redgrave and Tilly and an original story premise more then make up for some weak area's ( A series of rather unlikely coincidences making a twist in the family relations possible, and a villain who switches a little too easily from a halfwit-psycho to a charming young man and the other way round.) A must for all the fans of Godfather."
1,It's not in English!,"I ordered this movie and it came in a completely different language. German maybe? With, I think, Japanese subtitles. Very disappointing."
2,Bella Mafia Imported dvd,Stay away...scenes are MISSING... [my copy has Korean letters on it]...The original movie was worth the view...The cast was great...
3,Made for Tv stuff but pleasent,"A family is crushed but the murder of it's male members, including the deaths of two children. Now the widows of these men and this family must unite to find the killer or killers and get revenge for the lives taken.This is a predictable movie but watchable if you have nothing better to do."
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed. This reads more like a history book with occasional quotes thrown in. It is at times redundant. It is slow and difficult to read. This is not for the leisure reader who enjoys history mixed with fiction.
5,Something rotten in the state of Denmark,"This book was recommended by a friend who said that the mixture of history, sex and gore would appeal to me. She was right. I loved this book. Knowing nothing before of the pitiful king, Christian VII, his child bride Caroline Mathilde, and doctor J.F.Struensee, nor of Danish history, I found every page gripping. The interplay between these three persons, and the court officials around them make for a fascinating read. I even read some Danish history online to find out more. But I advise those thinking of buying it to get the unedited hardcover copy."
4,"If you love Shakespeare, this book is for you!","This book includes famous quotes from a variety of literary works by William Shakespeare. If you love Shakespeare's amazing words but don't have the time to read all of his plays, this book is for you."
4,Keep in mind this is a SLENDER Shakespeare!,"Any disadvantage this book has is that it is so small . . . But it is a good foretaste to his words and wit.I bought this book as a ""gateway"" to understanding Shakespeare. We have these long scripts we are reading, these five act plays written in an indented poetic Elizabethan English, sometimes verbose. And our English teachers wonder why it is so hard to understand the Bard.(I wonder if Shakepseare envisioned people reading his scripts, insteady of watching the scripts acted out on the stage!)I bought this book and have read it in parallel with the play-scripts that I am studing. I can capture the meaningful quotes and ideas in the plays. And that has made all the differnce in my perosnal enjoyment of Shakespeare!"
4,Jazz Pianist to Watch,"Stone's Throw is an impressive debut recording from a pianist and composer of considerable talent. Noriega's tunes crackle with individuality, making it clear that his ambitions reside in innovation not imitation. Introspective at times, energetic and boundary-stretching at others, these tunes seamlessly blend jazz and modern classical influences, expertly rendered by Noriega and his trio. Victor Noriega is a young pianist to watch."
3,A good but difficult book,"An Eye for A Dog is a good book that requires the reader to work very hard in order to get the maximum benefit from it: it should really be a DVD. It explains clearly and with excellant line drawings about dog structure and movement but the reader has to carry out excercises on just about every page in order to ""get"" the point that the author is making. The system works but it is rather like going back to school and requires effort. Additionally some of the authors comments are rather old fashioned in today's dog world and some of the breeds chosen as type examples are not generally popular ones, so that one tends to start to lose patience with the author. As said, this is a subject that today would be more user friendly if presented in DVD format with an accompanying booklet."
4,An Eye for a Dog: Illustrated Guide to Judging Purebred Dogs,"This book goes a long way towared explaining the secret of really ""seeing"" a dog. Cole uses drawings made from photographs of purebred dogs to systematically show differences between dogs, and then invites the reader to choose the ""correct"" drawing, based on breed standard. The book is clearly-written and readable. I think there is something in the book for anyone interested in purebred dogs--the dog lover about to buy a purebred puppy, the person wondering whether their dog is ""good enough to show"", and the experienced breeder exhibitor. I am a breeder/exhibitor, and I have recommended the book to my dog show buddies, including top breeders. Whatever your level of involvement, if you love purebred dogs, you should read this book."
2,"Great in one way, terrible in another.","I am trying to understand how to examine dogs for certain attributes. I want to understand why one body type can do something another can't. This book is great it explaining how to evaluate a given dog against its standard and will go into detail THAT a dog is supposed to be formed a certain way, but doesn't speak at all about WHY or HOW that form allows for a given function. Very frustrating, but it has to some extent helped me sharpen my eye for detail."
4,An eye for a dog,"This book is a good book for a breeder, handler or judge. As a pet owner I felt that it was to technical. I however liked the book because it gave a lot of examples that were easy to see and the author explained what was to be seen in each picture."
5,Training the eye,"Some things you never see until you notice them and after that you can never unsee them again. This book offered me loads of these eye-opening moments. The detailed illustrations don't always make it easy for you to compare one, on the first glance identical, dog to the next but makes you work hard and trains you better. You need to, however, have a bit of understanding on different breeds and/or take the time to read the standards in the middle of an exercise. But at the end it will be worth it! I am yet to train my eye to see excellent movement in real-life speed but at least I know what to look for plus it has greatly contributed torward an interest into different breeds I rarely noticed and now watch with keen attention. A great workbook for anyone trying to develop the eye for a dog!"
3,Fait Accompli - Excellent Imagery but Rampant Thoughts,"For a first book, this is well crafted. Some of the poems in the book are superb, while some are plain mediocre. But this is definitely a big book of poetry, and since most poetry books are half the size (excepted Anthologies or Collected Works), I will venture to say that about 50-60 poems in the book are par excellence.There is a lot of passion in his words and imagery, and in many more ways than one, the final words in his poems tend to hit home. Modern as the author's poetry may be, there is some classical moody feel to it which is quite palatable. Some poems are preachy, and one can do well without them. But for a first collection, I find it quite good. I will recommend this book to those who are interested in feeling out contemporary East Indian writers for lately their contributions have been quite powerful in fiction scene in NY."
2,Didn't Last,"Received quickly and in good condition, but after only a month, started getting printer cartridge errors. The black cartridge appeared to be leaking somewhat."
5,Got Ink?,"This was the best deal on HP Ink I found anywhere so being the smart consumer I am, I jumped on this. HP to me has the most affordable ink for their HP printers and well with the way I print pictures and data, this will last me awhile. Good deal, if you use this type of toner ink on your printer, go with the bundle deal."
2,The yellow ink dried up,The packaging was mangled as though it were wet. No worries the air tight seal was still intact. The problem is that the color ink cartridge dried up my computer is telling me that the ink is full but when I do a test the yellow is gone. Won' be buying on line again.
4,Works,I can't get over how expensive print cartridges are. I have purchased refilled cartridges in the past and was not pleased with the results. I am only slightly more pleased with the results of new cartridges. It seems like they just don't last as long as they should. I certainly don't print hundreds of pages off before the thing goes empty so i'm not sure what the issue is. I have read somewhere that if they aren't used reguarly they dry out but I have no idea if that is true or not. Amazon almost always has the lowest prices on this type of stuff although like I said i just can't believe how expensive they actually are. I have purchased several of these combo packs and they save money and seem to last the longest.
5,If only all textbooks were worth the price like this one,"This was required for a course I took and this is one of the best textbooks I have ever used.I had to take several criminal justice courses and this was my favorite, though all of them were interesting.This textbook is not dry, even though the subject matter is legal.The authors provide all aspects of evidence and pose the exceptions and why they exist, whether through court rulings or law.one of my favorite chapters is on the judical process itself. And of course the limits of witness testimony ( the exceptions and privlege that would prevent a doctor or lawyer from testifying against you, and when they can. ).It is funny, since I took this course I now can watch courtroom shows and understand the various technical stuff. Or watching court tv."
5,"Great drive, even better software","I needed to replace a failing Seagate hard drive and was unsure of how to duplicate the contents of the old drive on to the new, higher capacity Western Digital drive. I was extremely impressed with the included data lifeguard software. It could not have been easier to use. It even created customized instructions that detailed how to set the jumpers on the old drive to use it as a secondary unit. Since it was factory installed I would otherwise not have known the correct configuration. A fast and easy upgrade. Highly recommended."
2,WD2000JB is not reliable,"I bought this drive in 2003 year, and it failed after 2 years. I sent it in and got a new drive, since it was under warranty, and it's giving me trouble after 3 months! If this is like the last time, it will be dead within a month.This is in contrast to my Maxtor 6Y160P0 which has been running for two yearsand my dual Seagate ST3200822A which have been running for a few months with no hiccups.Linux reports the full drive name as WD2000JB-00GVA0, avoid it.Unreliable. Go with Seagate or Maxtor.I'm getting a new maxtor diamondmax 10 sata, IDE is getting obsolete."
2,questionable quality,"I used this for a few months before parts of the disk started to become ""bad"". The bad sectors started as 10MB and progressive grew to 60GB. I had to return it before the end of one year, and they sent me a new ""refurbished"" one. Don't know how long this one will last..."
1,Only 1 year warranty says it all,Drive went bad in less than two years and their warranty is only good for one year. The kind of company that makes hard drives they expect to fail after one year is not the kind of company I want to trust with my data.
1,Short-lived,This drive was great for the three months it worked before it crashed. I will not trust WD with my data in the future.
3,Ugly Looking Thing,This mouse is a so-so product in my book.Not the most attractive mouse.Changeable faceplates are unusable due to their color.
1,Very Little Science Fiction,"That collection of short stories displays PS's talent for writing and nothing else. All stories fail to grab the reader's attention. Either they are rehashes or long boring descriptions going nowhere. Yet I plodded through, always expecting the next story to be better than the previous one but never was I rewarded. Being a talentuous writer is not enough when imagination leaves you, indeed."
5,Very good adaptogen,"I purchased Rhodiola Root per my doctor's recommendation. I have been nervous due to my financial situation and uncertainty with my job. Although, both are not real problems as the finances are quite manageable, and the job is not going away. I guess I was just taking it too close to heart. After the doctor ran a few tests on me he concluded that I am under ongoing stress, and my adrenals are burning out. He suggested to start taking adaptogens, and Rhodiola Rosea was among his recommendations. I started doing that, and the relief was almost immediate. My situation has not changed, but my perception of it has. I am not as much worried as I used to be. I am better with my wife and kids, and I stopped waking up at night worrying about things that aren't worth it. I highly recommend this product as it helped my mind to take over the emotions and to stay cool."
4,"For me, very good efects.I have","I have 30 days to use the Rhodiola Rose root in 400 Mg. two times a day, the efects are very good for me, because I have a charge of stress very hard all days, and in the nights I can't sleep with tranquility, I need say that the sexual contact with my wife was undiferent, but, you must beleavme, I have 70 yers old and today the nervous are going out and my sexual feeling is more great, of course I'm not a young man with the Rhodiola use, but , I feel more strong, More calm and the effects in the marital contacts are much more satisfacttory. Please I give my apologies for my poor english, I'm mexican and I have not many practic with this language."
5,useful herbal supplement,"I like this Rhodiola rosea -- it seems to reduce stress from extra long working days with abnormally little sleep, as sometimes happens for a few days or weeks at a time. I don't take it regularly, so no opinion if you get immune to itsapparent benefit.Also, this was my introduction to Swanson vitamin company, which turns out I've been very happy with for other subsequent purchases."
3,Rhodiola Root 400 mg 100 Caps,"I was frustrated because this product Swanson web site didn't ship to California.That's why I've ordered it on Amazon.com where it was a little more expensive.This order was shiped on time.Important: I am taking this product for 2+ weeks and doesn't feel ANY effect I have experienced before taking adaptogens:no increased energy, concentration, or stamina.It's my personal observation."
2,Stick with the Siberian brands - this one is marginal,"Yes, you can buy Rhodiola rosea on Amazon, but you'll end up with products like this one, with no clinical trials and absolute uncertainty as to the effectiveness. Rhodiola is a very important herb, and those who are considering taking it should look for brands that are used by researchers. The University of California studies Rhodiola and they use two brands for their purposes, neither one of which is sold in health food stores. Neither one of which sells at a low price point. You get what you pay for with this herb."
1,Tried it -- too low powered for me,"I sincerely doubt that this product is 400 mg. It has no feeling of activity. It's like a mystery capsule that you take and forever wonder ""Did it do anything?"" The only advantage I see for this product is that it is cheap. But, after comparing it with other brands, I find it not even worth that much."
5,Exellent Adaptagen for type O blood type,"This supplement has really over the weeks been nourishing my adrenals and causing me to have more control over the stress my three boys cause me. I take one a day. I've had it now for two months. By the second week I noticed my body feeling calmer (but I also use my Jack La Lane Juicer too and have an electromagnetic chaos eliminator ie. a ""Q-Link""). The combination of these three plus exercise and zapping with my Hulda Clark parasite zapper, has done a one-two punch on my fatigue and stress."
1,The worst History book I have ever read,"History means objectivity. This book is full of subjective statements about facts, wrong or inexistent documentation in many of its assertions, and a clear bias in its writing. Paul Johnson tries to convince us that the History of the U.S. has been a difficult journey with a magical, divine end. Statements like 'for the first time in human history', 'the most important achievement of mankind', 'unknown in the rest of the world' abound.I was looking forward to finishing the book already after twenty pages. I would rather call this book 'Stories of the American people'. Let us be serious.I recommend the book as a good background reading before watching 'Independence day', or as a complement of Henry Kissinger's memoirs."
1,not that reliable as far as delivery time goes,"The book took three weeks to get here, which seems kind of ridiculous to me. The product itself was in good condition when it finally arrived."
1,Just start at the end,"Boy, am I glad I finally picked up this one. This has been fifth Johnson's book I read; without this one, I would probably go on reading and have to un-learn even more.Johnson's writes in the grand tradition of British tabloid journalism: looking for sensation and scandal, with an abundance of often patronizing opinions and utter disregard for objectivity. As long as you do not know what he writes about, it is entertaining and enjoyable. As soon as you enter the subjects you are familiar with, you will either smile (if you like his bias) or open your eyes wide with horror.So do yourself a favor, read about 10 pages from the last chapter and you will immediately know if this book is for you.As for me, I am finished with Johnson!"
1,Waste of your money,"Ha-ha. Another Paul Johnson gem. Had this been labeled ""fiction"" I'd give it five stars. Basically, this untiring Anlo-Saxon supremacist wants us to belive that Britain is the flower of humanity and the Americans are really well-disguised Englishmen. Oh, and the French are EVIL."
1,Utter Trash,"The Focus on the Family crowd is currently hyping this excrement on its ""Boundless"" right-wing PC website. That should tell you enough.For a REAL history of the American PEOPLE, try Howard Zinn's People's History of the United States."
5,America: Greatest of Human Adventures,"This is a superb historical narrative, authored by a gifted writer and an immensely talented, conservative historian who has an abiding faith in and respect for America: ""It is,"" concludes Johnson, ""still the first, best hope for the human race."" Johnson weaves outstanding scholarship, keen historical insight and analysis, and, yes, personal wisdom, into an historical text that reads like a novel, yet is bursting with more facts than an almanac (his source notes alone run to over 90 pages). Caution: Johnson's masterfully articulated but politically incorrect views (the engine within his story) will provoke, anger -- or possibly persuade -- readers subscribing to more liberal interpretations of American history."
4,Long but great,I purchased this book for my AP U.S. History class and just finished it today. Although it was long (976 pages of reading!) I thoroughly enjoyed it and like Paul Johnson's perspective and writing style.
2,A Striking Disappointment,"The problem with this book is that it isn't A History of the American People. It's a History of the American Government. The People appear in the book very sporadically, if at all. Unlike Mr. Johnson's excellent History of the Jews and History of Christianity, this volume is striking devoid of revelations. It reads like a college history text -- a decent one, but not one that makes history come to life. And that's what I miss -- that sense of life that's in Mr. Johnson's other books, and in the books written by Jan Morris. I do believe that Mr. Johnson can do better than this."
5,A book that makes United States History INTERESTING,"I really enjoy reading this book. It connects all the textbook facts into themes while adding interesting little tidbits that keep your attention. While definitely not the final word on everything, I adamently recommend this book for supplementary reading."
2,Full of unuseful facts about history.,"Johnson's book is full of interesting but not really useful facts about elite people in American history. He blends the facts with information of the elite, such as George Washington. I found that Johnson's book left about the little people in the history of the U.S., the people he talked about the most were the elite and polictical powers."
1,bizarre reading of American history; badly researched.,"It is difficullt to swallow a purported ""history"" of the American people that extols the virtues of Harding, Coolidge and Nixon as first rate presidents at the same time as it castigates Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a ""bad"" president. It becomes more difficult when these and other outlandinsh revisonist concepts are offered in the context of a badly researched book. For one who attempts to write a history of the American people to confuse and combine the identities of Confederate Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and Joseph Johnston shows that the author just doesn't have a real grasp of his subject. This is one of several factual errors that are annoying to the knowledgeable reader, an annoyance that is compounded when the book moves into the 20th century and presents a point of view that just doesn't make sense.This book is bad history."
4,A History of the American People in one short book,"The review title says it. Huge topic and compact product. High school history texts, written by or for review committees, cover topics of huge historical significance with a sentence. This book avoids that but it is till bodacious in scope and adequate in coverage."
2,An Over-simplification of History,"One must give some credit to Johnson for his ambitious attempt to narrate American History in one book. That said, the result is a frighteningly simplistic, depth-free ""listing"" of events. Worse, where he tries his pen at explanations of important moments in US history (particularly recent history), his point of view seems to come from Mars instead of London.Johnson displays an amazing lack of understanding of American politics and law. He chides American leaders and policy makers for their naivete, and he almost chuckles ""I told you so"" at America's international ""failures"" (as defined by himself) -- all attitudes that one associates with pre-WWII England, before the American rescue of the British way of life.A project of this magnitude would be vastly better if written dispassionately and without sly commentary. His slant of history makes the read much less enjoyable."
5,interesting and fun,This novel is on of great thought and insight. When you read it you can tell that it was thought out for a long time. The thing that I really like about it is that it makes American History fun. History is a very boring to lots of people and U.S. history usually makes those ideas start. The thing that Paul Johnson does that is different from most history authors is that he does not linger on one subject to long and his ideas are ones that are very intersting. I read all kinds of history books and this one has to be the best American History book I have ever read. Paul Johnson also touches on subjects that most people don't really think about. One of the ones that I found most interresting is that of the influence of jazz on America. Paul Johnson is a great writer and historian and I recommend him to any person looking for a good history read.
5,An Outstanding Commentary on the American People,"Some other reviewers have strongly criticized the historical accuracy of this text. However, the author, in his apologia at the beginning of the book, notes that this is not a standard history text, but rather a tribute to the American people. His writing style is far superior to the dry reading of history textbooks as he probes into the psyche of those who shaped one of the greatest powers on earth. Johnson brings history to life!"
4,A Worthwhile History,"I found this book informative and interesting, and would recommend it to anyone seeking to gain some understanding of American history. However, as a Englishman, I find at least one of the reviews on this page extremly offensive and arrogant: how dare someone casually accuse the Enlgish of living in the past and claiming to have ""rescued the British way of life"" when - fair enough - you gave us help that was desperatly needed, but had you given it earlier thousands of people would not have died; so, screw you, you bomabastic L.A. moron."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,"Finally, a history of the American experience, without apologizing for our forefather's decisions and actions. This book should be placed in all middle schools throughout the country, before the ""PC"" history crowd sterilzies their minds. A must read for all serious history students."
3,poorly edited,"The edition of this book that I read (1997, paperback) was fascinating, but poorly edited. It is refreshing to read about the U.S. from an outsider's perspective and I found the text engaging in that regard. However, it is full of countless typos that should have been caught by any self-respecting copy editor. That so many copy-editing errors were allowed to slip by makes me wonder whether the book was properly fact-checked as well, and if the other reviewers here are correct, it sounds like it wasn't."
1,Don't get too close...............,"Don't get too close to the present with this book! I found the first half very engaging and thought-provoking. I didn't disagree with any of his interpretations until we got into the 20th century and oh my gosh! Warren G. Harding was a fine president? FDR was a Commie who ruined America? Nixon didn't know about Watergate? I can't imagine (because I stopped reading) that Reagan would be anything less than a combination of Jesus, Charlemagne and Sister Theresa, and anybody who opposed Reaganomics must be clones of Charles Manson. Mr. Johnson seems to be able to carefully weigh and consider evidence from long ago, but when he gets towards modern times, he becomes a Rush Limbaugh-sputtering and spitting clown. But read up until the 20th century and you'll be rewarded. And as a high school U.S. History teacher, I might even assign some of the later chapters to illustrate how bizarre some thinking has gotten in this age of Political Extremism and Quackery."
1,A History of the American People,"The first 700 pages of this history are great! Unfortunately the last 300 pages reveal the author's biases! I don't understand how the author can absolve all of Nixon's presidential sins, but damn all the Supreme Court's rulings and the Democratic presidents since FDR! Does anyone wonder why GWB would award Paul Johnson the PMH, especially since GHWB was denigrated so thoroughly?"
1,Tunnel vision for the conservatively oriented,"I had bought a copy of Harold Evans ""The American Century"" which I enjoyed mainly for its excellent collection of photographs. After reading reviews complaining that it was too liberal, I decided to have a look at Johnson's book for a different perspective. I have been surprised and saddened by Johnson's tone. Unfortunately his book is not written from a scholarly perspective of investigating the complexity of American history with the purpose of illuminating the truth. All history is biased to some extent, but the language used by Johnson is beyond persuasive- its arrogant. I was hoping to find a reasonable presentation of a conservative perspective of historical events, but this book is written with such narrow mindedness that it reads more like an extended diatribe. I find it sad that talented historians sabotage their works with such strongly divisive motives."
1,Lost track along the way,"When I first started reading this book I thought I would stand the fact that is was too long. It was well informed, interesting and at times entertaining. My feeling was that I would rate it with at least 4 stars. Somewhere along the way I think Johnson lost track of his argument. He started covering too much material with no structure and stating very personal points of view as facts. When I got to the Great Depression I decided to quit. I realized there were more better informed books out there and that I was wasting my time. It was unfortunate, the book promised much more than it delivered."
1,A promising beginning but a pathetic end result.,"What began as a promising good read turned sour and distasteful long before it ended. Mr. Johnson obviously bit off more than he could chew without revealing his inability to write dispassionate history. By the time he reaches the civil war one begins to see a personal bias in his writing. I almost sensed a bit of racism and anti-Semitism in his tone. By the time he reaches the 60's it becomes obvious that he has lost control of his objectivity and has lapsed into a conservative political diatribe. You don't have to read the last 100 pages, you already know what he is going to say."
1,A jaw dropper on Nixon,"I haven't read all of this book, but I have just read the portion about Nixon and Watergate. I almost tripped over my jaw (which was on the floor) as I made my way downstairs to write this. Not once in the 4 or 5 pages devoted to Nixon and Watergate (a witchhunt, in Johnson's delueded opinion) is any mention made of wrongdoing on Nixon's part. No mention, for instance, is made of Nixon's attempt to obstruct justice by attempting to have the CIA stop the FBI's work on the break-in. I don't know what this says about the objectivity of the earlier chapters, some of which I have read and enjoyed. Not being a great student of American history, I have nothing with which to their objectivity. But this Nixon debacle does not offer me any encourgagement.(1 star rating based entirely on the Nixon stuff)"
3,Great through 1875; Very disappointing 20th Century,"Bought this without reading reviews or knowing reputatin of author, becuase I wanted a general survey type of history. First half was very interesting. Gained many new insights on the founding, settling of America. The author very nicely traces the development of the slavery issues, even during the periods when it was not the foremost political issues.However, when the author gets to the 20th century, his political orientations are so blatant and obvious, that the sense of major themes being developed is lost. The last 50 pages of book are disgustingly racist, sexist, et al. I will not read any more history by this author."
3,The first half: Great. The last 300pgs: Opinionated Drivel,"I wish I had read the reviews before I undertook the task of reading this lengthy work. I thought Johnson's analysis of key and also minor players through many of the countries challenging growing pains to be well researched and interesting. Once he got to 20th century politicians though, he turned his book into a partisan attack on Democratic ideas, minority movements, and anything other than conservative thinking. In Johnson's mind, FDR was a bystander, while Nixon was an innocent victim. While there is always room for interpretation, to ignore the blemishes of Reagan and Nixon, and ignore the contributions of Kennedy and FDR is irresponsible."
5,A great book,"I got Paul Johnson's History of the American people many years ago when I was still living in my old country, and found it absolutely fascinating. It reads well and keeps dry facts which can make history so unappealing to a minimum, and portrays the evolution of a truly unique country with a unique people in a clear, although not always objective manner. Be aware that this book isn't so much a history of the United States as a history of its people - verbatim what the title says. I recommend this book, as other works from the same author because even if the reader doesn't agree with everything he says it gives a perspective which is worth to consider, as well as some food for thought."
5,Great activity book,"I love this book and use it regularly in my classes. It really teaches the kids to think logically and follow the clues to the correct answer. But best of all, it is great fun!"
3,McCrumb's first effort,"Having read most of the Ballad series and a couple of later MacPherson's, I finally found a copy of McCrumb's first book, Sick of Shadows. While it lacks the polish and originality of her later efforts, I found it an enjoyable read.Elizabeth is a new college graduate, clueless as to her future. She's drafted to be the bridesmaid for her cousin who attended a mental hospital for her ""finishing school."" Much of the book is devoted to the eccentricities of the Chandler family - a cousin who lives at the physicist's commune, an overbearing aunt and the cousin who built his home in the style of Neuswanstein (spelling?) - the Disneyland castle. It takes half the book for the murder to occur. The local cops are terrific characters. The solution is a bit improbable but I still enjoyed to book overall."
2,A bit far-fetched,"I was disappointed in this, the first Elizabeth MacPherson book, having found McCrumb's Bimbos and Zombies books so delightful. Perhaps she was feeling her way around a new protagonist with a less broad style. In any case, I found the plot far-fetched, what with Alban's ""castle"" in the middle of nowhere. Eccentric is one thing, but this I found beyond credibility. I'm wary of investing more time in the McPherson mysteries, and will probably stick to McCrumb's masterful Appallachian novels, in which the writing is simply superb."
2,"O.K., but I figured it out early.",I found this book enyoyable until I guessed who did it fairly early on. I liked the character who narrated the story and would try another book by this author.
3,Light and easy,"This ought to be categorized with the Young Adult books. An easy read, likeable characters, and just enough plot to hold the attention of an adult. It would be a great introduction to the genre for a tween, if you could get them interested in a story without vampires!"
3,Another enjoyable Elizabeth MacPherson mystery,"The first of the Elizabeth MacPherson mystery series. The murder is referred to in ""The Windsor Knot"", so you may guess who the killer is if you read them in reverse order. It is still an enjoyable light mystery, nonetheless."
1,Piece of junk,"TOTAL Piece of junk!!!ughh.Starting from the first time I got this cooler the plastic that is supposed to keep the laptop away from the fan itself was too weak, which created a ticking noise every time the fan hit the laptop (3-4 fan wings on each fan * 100+ rotations a minute). I had to put a piece of rubber to keep a distance between the fan and the laptop.The fans are extremely noisy and really annoyed the hell out of my roommate who wanted to throw the cooler out the window. And as loud as they were, it did NOTHING to cool off my laptop.My laptop actually shut off several times from the heat while the fan was actually running.Plus, after a month or so of keeping with this garbage, the UBS line started to die to the point that the fans only worked when I played around with the wires. (Extremely dangerous & annoying - I was only able to do this because I'm an engineering major).All in all, total garbage and my money went straight into the garbage can."
1,Cheap. Poor Quality!,Don't buy this. Whale garbage. Made of plastic not metal. Fan speed is slow. I purchsed one from ebay that is made of metal and the fan speed is stronger.
3,IS THIS MADE OF METAL OR PLASTIC?,"I have not purchased this product yet, but I really want to - one problem is that I have a question that everyone has failed to answer with their reviews... My question is - is this item made of metal or plastic? There is an identical one - well at the pictures are the same - called ""USB Powered and Most Efficient Metal Cooler Pad with 3 Built-in Fans for Laptop Computer"" by Dekcell also sold on Amazon. The pictures are identical but the descriptions do not match up?? Could someone who has purchased this item clarify this for me - I would greatly appreciate it.. THANKS!!!"
1,Died in 3 months,"A bit over 3 months this thing died. I could smell the odor from the burnt motor. Very nice design, but my MacBookPro was constantly slipping on it too. Contacted Amazon and manufacturer for warranty exchange/return."
2,"Nice base, but the electronis are not so good","I did a bit of research on cooling bases for my Mac Book Pro and ended up with this one. seemed like the right fit for my needs. The 4 port hub, external powered fans, all seemed like a good plan. However, the fan power and hubs do not work consistently and didn't come with a power supply and should for this kind of money. I suspect I will have to go in a fix things up. I will first post a question to the manufacturer, but do not expect much. In general I like the product, just poor quality control on the electronics."
1,why do people rate this high?,im a gamer i have an alienware laptop that gets very hot i got this product because of the high reviews well the ports didnt work the fans made sound but seems to just do that i could hardly feel any air flow comming out of it it was so weak that my laptops fans still kicked on to cool it down not to mention that a month later one of the 3 fans crapped out this is over priced junk! this product is now being used by my boyfriend as a laptop prop up seeing as tho nothing works in it any more i cant belive people give such high reviews for things that only kind of work screw that oh and the cord to plug it in to the wall was way to short
1,Lightweight,"This is made from lightweight plastic. There is a little lip in the front, so if your laptop has controls on the front, this cooler will interfere with them. Also, if your laptop only has USB slots in the front, the cooler's short USB cable may not reach them. Widescreen laptops will hang over the sides and make the unit a little unstable. The fans are quiet though."
5,cool fan,I have a T23 Thinkpad. It works great! The only problem was that it got warm after an hour's use. I thought I would try this fan to see if it would work. Because of the low price I thought there was a catch. Because it plugs into a usb port I didn't expect it to be very efficient. I also thought it would be loud. I was wrong. This keeps my thinkpad from getting warm and it is surprisingly quiet. The only drawback is that it is curved and opened on the bottom so it does not sit on your lap comfortably. But if you get a little lapdesk there is no problem.
3,Nzxt Cryo LX,"It's a good lap top cooler. Probably the most powerful one you can find. But my MacBook Pro had trouble powering it. At least there is a DC adapter outlet built into the Cryo LX. It's obviously built for the gamer. It's big and moves a lot of air, but it's meant to be kept on the desk, especially if your plugging it into a wall outlet instead of your USB ports."
5,The best,"Very quiet, very good it is priced higher then other ones but its worth it cause its still running as if I just bought it. I am using it in afghanistan it stays on high it fits 15.6 well, you could actually put a 17 inch on it so it is big. Just don't expect to carry it around its a stay on the desk or whatever type of cooler."
4,Good Item,"This cooler reduces 10+ degree for my laptop. and it makes almost no noise. And the delivery is very fast. And the structure of this cooler is very simple so that I think I can clean it up easily by myself. Anyway, I recommend it to the people whose computer need decrese degree in day of high temperature."
1,Disappointed,Product is very flimsy and cheaply made. Two fans work and one fan only works for a few seconds every time it's turned on. I recommend investing in something different.
2,Front Ledge Too Thin,"I bought this cooling pad over other pads because the pictures showed a lip at the front of the product that could hold my laptop on our portable computer table we use with the tray at an angle, but it does not work; the ledge is too thin and the feet for the product protrude through the top and raise the laptop above the useful height of the lip. I am sure it works great as a cooler, it is substantial and sturdy; just not for my needs. I need a cooler for my HP that can't keep itself cool enough on any surface. I think I may need to toss my computer table, or my laptop."
1,Crappy,"OMG I would be saying this, but this is THE CHEAPEST, BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK I have ever bought. I already owned the LapCool2, but since I dropped it once and the blades on the fans broke, it became very noisy, so I came online and looked for a replacement. I was very happy to see that a newer model had come out, and at a cheaper price even, but BOY, did that lower price come at a cost! No more 4-port USB hub, no more aluminum cooling plate, no more nice reclining footies or flip-out footies to help machine get more ventilation. If I had got it myself, I'd have sent it back immediately as a misrepresentation, but unfortunately I had someone bring it to Mexico for me since I couldn't come to the USA to get it myself. I will NEVER again buy something just trusting on brand credibility or experience with previous products."
2,cooler pad,Longevity short. The fan can not be muffled. Laptop cooling on a scale 1 thur 10; give it a 3.
2,Bum Fans,lasted about a week and then the fans started making noises. Now it makes an annoying noise every time I turn it on. I have to gently tap the top and bottom of the fan for it to not make that noise. I wish I had an extra set of hands to give this product Four Thumbs Down!
3,Cheap.,"When I type and put barely any pressure on it the fans touch the plastic, kinda dissappointed, shoulda just paid the extra and got a better one, not as high tech and effective as it says."
2,Notebook Cooler,"I'm NOT impressed with this cooler. Hardly any fan power, plug-in part already broke. Very cheaply made. The best part of this order was the quick shipping."
3,18 inch laptop cooler,"Big and bulky. Does a great job cooling my HP 18.4 laptop. Careful, you can pinch your fingers."
2,started to make noise in one day,"Yesterday I received my order and was very happy about it. For just few hours. Then it started making noise, more and more loud. Yes, it does its job, keeping my laptop cooler than it was before, but today I feel quite sick after using it for just couple of hours because of this noise."
3,"Does it's job, but don't set it in your lap","It certainly does it's job keeping the laptop cool, but having no bottom is a real problem.We've only had this about a week now and I've already stuck my fingers into the fan blades twice now, and to actually set it on your lap you must first set it on a large book or clipboard to keep your clothing from getting caught up in the fans and stopping the whole works.It works great, but be careful using it."
3,It worked for a month...,"This cooling pad worked so great for the first month or so I had it, and then it just stop working. No matter how I tried to fix it, it just burned out. My computer gets rather hot and somewhat overheats and doesn't run super well when it gets that hot, so I really needed this cooling pad. Not sure why it quit working, but it might of just been because it's cheap plastic and couldn't handle how hot my computer got. Sad it didn't work out but glad I didn't waste much money."
2,LapTopCool3,The LapTopCool3 worked fine until the fan quit. Had it about a year. It seemed to do the job although the plastic surface was too slippery. It had pads on the top to supposedly stop the laptop from slipping off the cooler. They weren't very effective. I ended up cutting up several pieces of sponge to prevent the computer from doing that. Also the power cord that attaches to the computer had a tendency to disconnect. No big deal though. I bought a later model which I disliked intensly for one reason. The bottom of the later model is not covered rendering it very uncomfortable in my lap. The edges of the exposed bottom of the cooling pad dig into my legs. So I gave up and bought another device.
3,"It cools the laptop, but....","When I start up my laptop in the morning, it truly sounds like an airplane is taking off in my office! Fortunately, it quiets down after a minute or so.The three-fan configuration does cool off the laptop, so the product is satisfactory. It will probably be OK with any size machine, because I'm using it with a 17-inch computer. So if you can get past the roar, you might want to try this."
3,Notebook Cooler,"Its OK.At best a 3/5. It doesn't keep my Macbook Pro as cool as I would like it to be, but it certainly runs a lot cooler than before.Its plastic, I thought it was going to be Aluminum, which would help cool it down if the fans were integrated into the cooler well."
5,Quiet with Great Performance,"I cant believe that its so quiet. Honestly, I can't even hear it at all. It performs very well always keeping my laptop cool. I have had my laptop and it running for a week at a time and the bottom of my laptop is still cool to the touch. Occasionally the end of the usb cord that fits into the device come undone when it on my lap, but it takes one second to plug it back in. I would definitely recommend this Vantec USB notebook cooling pad to anyone I know."
2,Cheap crap,"Cheap crap that made as much cooling effect as a book on my dell. Within 1 month one of the fans is dead. The plug on the side falls out with any movement or looses contact. The fans blow out the back which is nice, but if they were reversible I could bring cool air to the bottom of my laptop where it gets its fresh air and actually cool the laptop down."
2,Works- Sort Of,"I was looking for a good laptop cooler as a possible replacement in case I return my ComfyLap Adjustable Laptop Desk I got for X-mas. The cooling fan on the desk works much better and is much quieter than this product despite the fact it only has two fans in the center. I thought with three fans and a raised surface the Kinamax would do a better job. However, when I touch either side of my laptop's front panel it's still warm. With the desk cooling fans, one side was slightly warm and the other completely cool.The Kinamax works a little and does keep my laptop fans from turning on as much but knowing what's possible I can't say this is a product I will keep. Probably will return it. The fan isn't loud but it's more noticeable than the other.Update 2/6/12 - This thing just keeps running louder and louder. The fans aren't touching anything and even when I take the laptop off it runs just as loud. Downgrading this product from 3 to 2 stars."
1,Horrible Fan,This is a very very very cheap product . I do not recommend it to anyone. Please shop around you will find something much better and better $ value.
2,Kinamax FAN-NTP3 Business Notebook Cooler Pad,This item needs to be rated as to what computer it will actually work with. We have tried it with a couple of different brands of lap top computers and found that it is very difficult to impossible to keep the computer from sliding off of it. To say the very least I am very disapointed with this cooler!
1,This product is terrible,"To start off, it's a complete waste of money.The cooler is extremely noisy, and makes awful screeching sounds depending on the placement of the laptop.It doesn't support my laptop well, at all.It gives off an awful burning smell.It does not keep my laptop cool, and gets hot on the bottom making it uncomfortable to prop against legs.It's terribly flimsy, and as I type it makes awful noises from the light weight of my fingers pushing the buttons.I'm extremely disappointed after reading other good reviews on this product."
1,BAD item.,"Product does not reduce heat from computer. It does not cool, but triesto remove the heat. Only ran for a couple days before breaking, but it didn't actually work anyway. Better off just blowing a personal fan on the laptop, which helps but is very inconvenient. This is a really bad product. And nowhere on the cooler or its packaging does it state ""Kinamax"" or any brand name. I would rate it zero stars if I could."
2,Not the best,I bought this for my daughter and the first time she used it one of the fans began making an annoying noise which naturally stopped when she removed her laptop This thing is flimsy and if it is not sitting on a flat surface when you use it the fan hits up against the side making the annoying noise. My daughter put it in her closet and hasn't used it since.
4,Good for 2-3 years,"This product was used to cool my netbook, and did OK until one of the fans stopped working (and making noise)."
4,Good for the Money,"Quiet, performs well with my wife's laptop that remains docked at all times. Would not be suitable for portable use because of the open bottom and exposed wiring."
2,Loud and one Fan doesn't work.,"I just got this 2 days ago. One of the fans does not work and it's really loud. I am not living in the states right now so I am unable to return it, but if I could I would. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Good purchase,The laptop cooler does a great job. The only problem was when it was recieved and plugged in it would not work at first. The problem was one of the wires was not conected entirely and that caused it not to run. All in all good buy.
5,Very good product,"Very good product - what you see is what you get kind of a product. The two coolers are very quiet and they keep the laptop cool. No on/off button, plug and play. The noisy laptop cooler never started after using Vantec's cooler. I am using for almost an year now, no problems it all.Recommended. Cheap and worths the money."
2,bad plug. bad bad plug!,"The fan part of this unit works fine. But for some strange reason, the unit's power cord has to be plugged in at both the USB end into the computer (which is fine) and also into itself (which is not fine.) In only a few weeks, the power cord connection in the unit starts to become loose and fail. There is NO reason this cord shouldn't be permanently connected and internally wired at the one side, and only need to plug into the computer with the USB end. Mine stopped working and I had to take it apart and solder the wires together inside the unit myself in order to make it work.I'd pass on this unit and look for one that is hard wired so you don't have to worry about the connection. Also the plastic is very thin and cheap, so if you pick it up by one end while it's running, the torque will make the fan catch and grind."
4,"Works well, but needs some additional controls...","First of all, this is a really good cooler.At first, I was concerned because of all the metal - and how it may affect wireless signals. So far, no trouble.One obvious mistake I see is there is no ON/OFF switch. I thought that was rather strange, as you just need to unplug it to shut it off at night (I use a Mac).The air flow comes out the sides, near where you may have a wireless mouse -- and I find that slightly annoying.All in all, I think it's a slick item and I recommend it."
3,Kinamax FAN NTP3 notebook cooler pad with builtin 60 mm fans for laptop,"I absolutey loved this for the first week.It cooled my laptop quietly,then after the first week it is a bit louder,but tolerable.So I am still using it as I need it.Dell laptops do not cool well on their own,not mine,nor my stepdaughters, or my sons eithers. I like the product alot,I just wish it had stayed as quiet as it was the first week.Its not so loud that its distrating yet,but much louder then it was.I can stand it as it is,if it does not get any louder then this.Its still does its job keeping my laptop cool."
2,Not very durable,"I bought this product awhile back and I actually don't even have it anymore because it's BROKEN!!! It's made of some really cheap plastic, The fans did there job for about a month and then there starting making really loud noises until the cease to work at all."
2,cheesy peice of plastic,"if the back of the laptop is uneven it can press on the fan guards which result in fan stop and ""creepy"" noise..."
3,Kinaax NTP3 Laptop Cooler,"The product does a great job of cooling a laptop and is VERY quiet. It is perfect for use on furniture, but if you use it on your lap, as I do, you need something under it. I used a cutting board.The construction is flimsy, the wiring open on the bottom, and I managed to break the on/off switch after only 6 weeks of toteing it around in a case with my laptop. Leave it in one location, like on a desktop, and it should give years of service. If you are very careful, it can stand up to travel.Because of the construction issues, I replaced it with a Targus PA28U. This unit is more durable, the wiring fully enclosed, and cools just as well. It is not as quiet and is more expensive. It sits on a desktop or lap without additional support."
2,Cooler laptop but not to the desired level,"This product does cool down my laptop but not to the point where you would expect it to be. My laptop's internal fan still comes on because certain areas of my laptop are still overheated. I can feel that the top of my notebook is still overheated even while the fans are running. Also if positioned even slightly off, the fans rub against the bottom of my laptop and start to make a grinding sound. It seems that this laptop is for smaller notebooks possibly because mine is 15"" but the advertisement says anything from 12""-17"". If I could do it over, I would have bought a different one. Definitely not recommended."
4,"Low price, do a good job!","I'm have used it for about a month now. It's working quite well, blowing air to the bottom of my Acer TravelMate. Work quietly.However, there are some drawbacks:-Can't place on your lap directly. Need to place on a hard flat surface otherwise will not have air flow.-No additional USB port, so you lose 1 port of your notebook for it.-positions of fan are a bit above the hot spots. They blow behind the keyboard. But my notebook's hot spots are behind the hand rest.If you accept these drawback, it's a good deal."
3,Thin but not enough air,"This product is thin, but does not generate much air flow. I like that the air intake is in the back instead of on the bottom like earlier models, but the plastic housing is so thin that it can be pushed into the fan blades."
1,The most flimsy cooler I've ever used.,"Title says it all folks. This is the most flimsy laptop cooler I have ever used. Apply just the slightest amount of pressure to the bottom of the cooler and the plastic bends in and either the fan makes a horrid noise or it completely stops until you re position the cooler.I suppose I shouldn't have expected much out of this for the price tag.. But I at least thought it would be more durable.If you're looking for a decent ++ laptop cooler, continue your search."
5,Does what it says,Before I got the Vantec LapCool 3 Notebook cooler my laptop used to get overheated and shut down quite a lot. Since using this laptop cooler I have not seen my laptop shutdown even once. Have to agree with other reviewers that this laptop cooler is super quiet. Well worth the money.
4,"Good fans, poor cable.","I purchased this product in September of 2009. It has worked fine for me until this last week. The cable is now faulty and you have to move it in certain places in order for the fans to turn on and work.I decided to just you a power plug for another thing i had that i didn't use anymore. This product supports a Rated DC5V, but I'm currently using a wall charger for a toy i had to let the fans operate now (The Charger is a DC6V). I give the product 4 stars because of the excellent quality of the fans, and how they actually do work. The cable was the only problem. So if anyone is having and issue with there cable, use a wall mount charger you might have laying around :). I wouldn't recommend anything over DC6V."
1,Really awful,So very disappointed. The connections are poor. The cord that enters the USB adapter is already separating from the wire. Wire is now exposed.I do not abuse anything - this is a very poorly made piece of equipment.The idea is to use this with a LAPTOP - thus there is some movement required from time to time. This fan will NEVER last.I'm so disappointed. I won't be ordering from this company again and don't recommend anyone doing the same.
1,crap,"crap, one fan stop working after month, another makes terrible noise, uhh, need to find something else"
5,Silent and powerful,Really quiet and nice that it is powered by USB. Heat is ejected to the rear so it does not bother you. A++++
2,"Does the job, but is dismally designed","Yes. This unit keeps notebooks cool and the fans are very quiet. But that's all the positives I can state for this product.If you like having the laptop on your LAP (where else) this unit is dismal. The bottom and the fans are exposed and sharp edges make you want to avoid using the fan in the first place. My laptop (a ThinkPad T61, is not a good fit on the surface of this unit. The shallow lip on the front is not effective at keeping the laptop from sliding forward.Good quality fans, poor product design."
3,Cooling Fan for Laptop,"This product works okay, just found it a little flimsy, should have been built better but okay for the price."
2,so-so product,"It works - however -1. draws too much current from my old usb 1.0 (dell inspiron) jack and sometimes the computer gives warnings.2. makes about as much noise as my laptop fan.3. it can only be used on a desktop, not on your lap.4. workmanship is below average.Also, the unit draws air from the top where computer is - not sure if this is more effective than blowing to the computer."
2,Good while it lasts,"This item pushes A LOT of air and really keeps your laptop cool; however my fan died in about six months after purchasing, and when I contacted the company, they were a load of bull. They said I was responsible for the shipping to their factory, then if they didn't find anything wrong with it, I had to pay a restocking fee for them to ship me a new one. And they claim this product has a one year warranty, if that warranty is ""you pay us to fix the product"". The product pushes a phenomenal amount of air, while it lasts."
3,Loud sound,"Awful, can't even use it because the fans hit the plastic way to much, causing a loud sound.dont bother. the fans are good and its light wait. it just not a good product for me."
1,Died quick,The power supply near the USB end ended up with a short less than a month from purchase. I have to hold the cord at a steep angle to get the lapcool to turn on. As soon as I let go it goes dormant again. Worked well while it worked. Put better quality wire in the USB supply and this would get a great product for the price.
4,Don't confuse with the Dekcell model,"This cooling pad is very similar (I would say a knock off) to the one offered by Dekcell and available on Amazon with the title ""USB Powered and Most Efficient Metal Cooler Pad with 3 Built-in Fans for Laptop Computer"".I use the Dekcell model at work and am satisfied with it, and wanted to order one for home use. Although I was the one who actually selected the one to order at work, I goofed up at home and ordered this Kinamax instead. They have basically the same design and the fans seem about the same strength, but the Dekcell has a nice aluminum frame and the Kinamax is somewhat flimsy plastic with sharp corners.I'll keep this one, but hopefully others will read this review and choose the aluminum framed Dekcell instead."
1,Worst product purchased so far...,"Hi, I have a very bad experience with this laptop cooler. As of this morning, I threw it into the recycle bin within 3 months of purchase. I would say that I should have brought those ""made in china"" laptop cooler as it's cheaper and more reliable.The main problem with the product is that the cooling fan fails to spin when I plug it into my USB port and will only work after a lot of twitching of the USB connector. Apparently, it's due to some defective design that cause this problem to happen. And it didn't just happen to me. Another colleague of mine who have brought the same product has the same problem as well.So far, I have tried to communicate with the manufacturer and as of yesterday, I didn't receive any respond from them.So to all prospective customers, I won't recommend this product as you can get cheaper and more reliable stuff out there."
2,Well it's still running...,"I can't say much about this thing, essentially it's a large - empty and light housing for two computer fans. I've had to take it apart constantly to figure out what was causing it to make noises, I still don't know what it is/was. However that aside after breaking it, saudering it and gluing it back together, the fact that it still works amazes me. So it's a very reliable product nearest I can tell, but it's got a very low quality standard. Still it keeps my lappy cool when I'm gaming so I can't really complain. Though I would recommend you find one with 3 to 4 fans, two just ain't enough for a desktop replacement. Oh and it's hard as hell to clean dust from if you aren't willing to take it apart. Unless you like using compressed air, in which case it doesn't really matter.2 stars for it still working.. somehow..."
3,Its okay,"Good quality, but laptop slips off. Plastic surface is too slippery. They (manufacturer) should put some rubber pads or rubberized surfaces to give laptop a grip when placed on this cooler."
1,Does not cool hardly if at all!,"I bought two of these, one for use & one for a backup & I will be returning them. I come to find that this cooler hardly does any cooling at all! They are also very, very poorly made. Don't buy this thing, its junk! The Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler works MUCH better & is better made."
3,True deal of the NoteBook Cooler PAD FAN,"CONS: With the fan on, my laptop still gets pretty hot in 2 hours or so.3 fans(seen on the picture)PRO:I think this was made for mini netbooks.Makes very low soundInexpensiveCON&PRO;: The Laptop-fan is slanted like a ramp. So if you are sitting on your bed with it, then it will hurt your back but if you put it on a desk, it will feel more comfortable."
1,Poorly made,"Pro's- Cools efficientlyCon's- Exposed cables- Exposed fans collects dust- Makes excessive amounts of noise- Glides off when you're using a Laptop Support board ([...])Within months of using this it started to glitch due to the cables being exposed.And the noise the fans makes makes me turn it off and leave me with an overheated laptop that doesn't performthe way I'd like it to. Easy to say, I am now looking to buy a new cooling pad.I would NOT recommend anyone to buy this."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"CHEAP PRODUCT! I wish I could give it no stars...I have only had this for 3 months and it already broke. The wiring is super cheap and fell out where the usb connects. I am trying to figure out if there is a warranty, but I don't think there is one. That will teach me never to buy something without a warranty! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Piece of Junk,"This piece of junk is flimsy, shoddily built and all 3 fans died within 2 weeks. I returned it to Amazon for a refund, but never got the refund.Very frustrating all around."
2,"Not ""Slient""","Cons: This is not as quiet as I would have hoped given the ""Silent"" claims and feedback left by others. I occasionally have to turn off since the background noise is annoying after a while. It would be nice if it was larger -- really is the size of a netbook.Pros: Plastic seems sturdy, nice and thin and most importantly does a good job of cooling the laptop.Summary: I'm not keeping this one and don't recommend since it's not ""silent"" enough."
4,Kinamax FAN-NTP3 notebook cooling pad,"I have found this products performance very satisfactory. The triple fan design cools well, but it has one flaw. Just as other reviews have stated, it has no back cover, exposing the fans and wiring. That is a problem with carrying and using the cooler on you lap. As suggested, a cutting board or similar flat surface item is needed, to protect this products units from your fingers and clothing."
5,really cool,"If you use your laptop on your lap, then this is the product for you. I took my laptop into be fixed because it was over-heating and shutting down. They recommended a lap top cooler, of which I had never heard. Surfed the web and got this product. It performs well, as does my computer.Plus, it is a real bargain."
2,Disappointing,"The fan is reasonably quiet, and moves air well. However, the fan wobbles/vibrates, and I am concerned about the long term impact of having the laptop, especially the disk drive, sitting on top the constant vibration, so I have the fan turned off."
2,Lap cooler died within a month,"I've had the lap cooler for about a month and just noticed yesterday that the fans stopped working all together. I'm not sure what happened, but I surmise, if overworked (left on for a long period of time), that the fans will burn out.The product did work for the month and I was seemingly satisfied (although my 15"" macbook would slide off if it wasn't on a sturdy surface.) -- hence, not a lap cooler, but a desk cooler.I'd suggest you think again before purchasing this brand of lap cooler. Perhaps one that doesn't haven't to connect to your usb."
2,Doesn't help at all for me...,"I bought this with the hopes of bringing down the insane temperature my customized HP zd8000 laptop was turning out. It was routinely running at 147-180 degrees Fahrenheit (147 idle, 180 watching a video) but it is also almost seven years old now. That was with my old laptop cooler which saw one fan stop working entirely and one fan go on and off periodically (there were only two fans on it). I plugged this cooler in and there has been no change at all. Still running the exact same temperature. Very disappointed considering the price and other reviews."
3,It works,"Cheap material and it looks like it's not gonna last very long, but it works great. I think it's a good deal for the price."
4,Very quiet,"Sept. 2, 2010:UPDATE: The laptop cooler is very good and it is very quiet, however, I have noticed the grid that separates the fan from the bottom of the laptop gets weak and when the grid gets hot, it will sag and the fans will rub against the fan grid. This is probably done by material fatigue. I'll still by another one like this, because it is very thin, keeps the LT cool and very quiet. For 20 bucks a year, I'm not complaining.Works great for me. Very quiet, draws cool air and then extracts the heated air from under the fans. Very nice. I will buy another for my other laptop. Don't know why others may have given this a bad or common review, but it is a very good fan and the price is right also."
2,Wrong Way!,"Built better than some, but disappointed. This blows air UP under laptop, not suck hot air OUT from under and away in back. Not as effective as some less expensive."
1,"Worked good when it worked, which wasn't for long","My wife uses her laptop exclusively, and all day long hour after hour. She puts a lot of mileage on it, and as such the laptop gets a tad too hot. She needed some exterior cooling mechanism, and so she purchased this. It worked for about a month, then one of the fans stopped working. Not long after she said it started to smell like something burning, so it was unplugged and thrown away. I vouch for her claim that it smelled like burnt wiring since I also smelled it. I would steer clear of this item at all costs."
2,It seemed to be working fine but died after 4 months,"At the beginning it looks promising since it is light and somewhat keeps the laptop cool, but the product is so crappy it died on me after 4 months even though i did not use it often..."
2,"Great price, not wired very well.",Have had the product for less than 3 months and the wiring is shot. One fan went out in the first week and just lost a second tonight. The wiring comes exposed easily.I do like that it was usb powered and didnt have to be plugged in seperately.
2,Useless,"I bought this because my laptop was overheating to the point where it would stop functioning. I didn't expect my laptop to be completely cooled down, I just wanted to make sure the heat wouldn't affect its performance. I feel a weak breeze from the fans, but they produce no noticeable effect on my laptop--it still crashes/freezes from overheating (you can fry an egg on it..).Pros:-lightweight-quietCons:-flimsy plastic construction-not effective-breaks easily"
2,Lapcool 3 fan is noisy,At first I was pleased with the performance of the Lapcool3 notebook cooler but the fans started getting progressively louder and louder. I believe that the laptop weight (5.4lbs) was too much for the laptop cooler. The cheap plastic that protects the fans sags onto the fan with any measureable weight from the laptop and causes undue wear and tear. Yes it cools jsut fine but it is really loud. Would not recommend this product.
2,Does Not Last,"I have now bought two of these, and will probably buy a third sometime next year. They first one only lasted 6 months. Cheap, shoddy construction. The USB power cord separated at each end. So, why did I buy another? It's the right size for my very small notebook and the padded cooling pad cover I have. If it's the specific size you need, that is the _only _ reason to buy this."
3,"So-so, needs better wires and connection.","Purchased on June 12, 2008-After 3 years of use this cooling fan still works but suffers from the same manufacturing defects other brands do. Shortly after purchasing it the wires connecting to the on/off switch stripped. Like Targus, use cheap wires and bad connections. It is the weak point of most cooling pads.I have since completely removed the on/off switch and tied the wires together so the unit is always on when the USB cable is plugged in. One fan makes a lot of noise on initial startup and then calms down after a minute or two. Overall it does a good job cooling the laptop but one needs to place it on a flat surface when using it on a bed or lap for proper air intake. A book or tabletop underneath works best."
4,"Quiet, Slim, Light, Works, but not cool enuff for MacBook Pro with Battery","It looks flimsy, but it isn't. I like the USB connection. It holds up to what it says: quiet, slim, light, and it works.For MacBookPro with battery, it works ok, but it's still a little warm, but bearable. So I decided to remove the battery, and it just works fantastic! I love it and I'm happy about this product. I highly recommend it to others!"
4,Does the job...Yes it has exposed wires...3.5 stars,"I read the reviews about the exposed wiring before buying this and still bought it (mainly because it was cheap). By itself, you can't place it on your lap. I placed it in a cookie sheet and its a match made in heaven. If you buy this, you should go to the cook wear section of amazon and get a 15.25"" x 10.25"" x .75"" cookie sheet (the size I'm using).Other than the exposed wiring it does a great job of cooling my 15"" MacBook Pro."
3,"Noisy, but works.","It did make a difference keeping my Macbook cooler. But it is very noisy. At least my unit was.I wound up getting a Targus and it is much quieter and does a great job. Both are plastic, butthat's better than lugging around one more heavy thing. Doesn't suck as much power as otheritems, but it does take a chunk when you're unplugged.This one is cheaper, but the Targus at W*****t runs around ten more."
2,Low Quality Product...,Product is of very low quality and does not push out as much air as I had expected based on the specs.But it is cheap so if you are looking for something economical and are not expecting too much this product is for you. If you want something sturdy and high end avoid.
4,"Keeps the laptop cool, but works best on flat surfaces","So in the right condition these fans work wonders. They are what you want, quiet yet powerful.The only down side I ran into is that when it's not on a flat surface air cannot be sucked into the fans. There is no back to the device so on a blanket or even a couch like surface the fans will rest directly on the surface and not be able to function properly.Bottom line, you get what you pay for and I'm happy with the product."
3,It works but you get what you pay for,"It is a flimsy fan. And I would not feel comfortable using this if I were contsatntly moving it around. But it is inexpensive and works as described. In my use(I use it to keep a BoxeeTV cool) it is on a flat surface and will not be moved. The fan does not come attached to the base. You need to screw it into the base with two screws that are in the middle of the fan. It is very quiet and does provide a decent amount of air flow. I've had no issue with vibration so far. It has two blue LEDs, but I cut those off since I have no need for the light. Mine will be in use 24/7. Although with the quality of the fan I'm curious how long it will last in use 24/7. But it does what it says and provides a decent amount of air flow."
5,Still works great.,"Bought this for daughter laptop that was constantly running hot. After setting this fan under the laptop and plugging it in, it has not ever ran warm."
1,This is a piece of crap!,"For starters, when I opened the box, the fan wasn't even attached to the base. Because I didn't feel like returning it and having to wait for Amazon to process a return or exchange, I decided to just glue it back on... Which worked for about 2 minutes, at which point it fell the hell back off. And on top of it falling apart, the fan is open on the bottom(not eclosed). Which means that if it is not sitting on a flat surface, the fan on the bottom can come in contact withm and get tangled in anything. I've realized I don't have the patience for this crap, soooo it well be returned promptly."
3,Fans not where I needed them,"This notebook cooler is actually more lightweight than I thought it would be. That part about it is great. It is also extremely quiet and easy to use. What I should have thought about before I bought it was the location of the fans. My laptop was overheating in the upper right-hand corner, and the fans were located in the center, so the cooling system did no good for me. The fans also didn't seem powerful enough to solve my overheating problem anyway. Something more powerful (and noisy?) may have worked. I ended up adjusting the power usage control under the control panel on my laptop, and the computer cooled down."
5,Strong Vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum for as a gift for my wife (she asked for a new vacuum) and she loves it. The amount of dirt and cat hair it picked up was quite impressive. The dirty floor light is interesting, and seems to be correct. It's not hard to learn to use the self propelled feature, actually its very easy to use and easy to empty the dirt cup."
4,Darn nice vacuum,Ok I'll keep this short:1) Setup took 5-7 minutes.2) Started up No Problem.3) The self propelled feature is really cool - it works like a hot damn.4) The bin does fill up a little quick5) Though from the pictures the handle looks cheap - It is not. It's brushed aluminum I think. Very nice to use and comfy.6) A little heavy but negated by the self propelled mode.7) Doesn't like stairs to much.8) Has lots of accessories hidden in the vacume.9) Good reach on the hose!10) I used this on new carpet which had tons of fuzz - So much in fact that I almost filled a garbage bag - and it plugged the hose on the vacuume once. Took 5 minutes to clear.11) I'm a guy and I have to say that I actually LIKE vacuuming when I'm using the vacuum.Would I buy it again? Yes. ..
3,SKIP IT!,"ONE OUT OF FIVE STARS! Within the first few minutes of using this vacuum, the belt broke. That was just the beinning! There are multiple filters that need to be replaced all the time; the bagless container needs to be emptied after EVERY room; the roller brush works only when it feels like it and the belt needs frequent replacement. I would say this vacuum ""SUCKS!"" But that would actually be a compliment for a vacuum. Definitely SKIP this one!"
1,The worst vacuum in the market,"I bought this vacuum based on the high ratings that I read in the reviews. To make a long story short, if you are looking for the worst vacuum cleaner in the market, if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that needs an overhaul every time you use it, if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that will give you mechanical problems every time you use it, if you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that will get you broke because the belts break and the filters plug and the hoses plug, go ahead and buy this one. Eureka should be sued for putting out such a defective product."
5,Not much to improve on this one.,"My husband saids I am the queen of vacuums. But when I find something I like I stick with it. I have had this vacuum for almost 5 years w/o any problems. No broken parts and it's never needed repair. Cleaning is great and it's easy to use. I orginally brought it because of physical problems and needed a vacuum that would move w/o pushing, now my 9 yo daughter does the vacuuming with ease. Would be nice if it had a longer hose for the attachments. And it is too heavy to be carrying up & down the stairs all the time. In our last house I had less expensive light weight vacuum for the second floor. This is a great vacuum for the ranch house that we have now."
5,Winning Concepts for Draw and Lowball,"The book is terrific. The service was terrible. I accidentally double ordered the book and the Amazon clerk refused to allow me to cancel one order, saying that ""The book was already pulled, boxed and ready for shipment."" Although it was only two minutes since I had ordered the book twice by mistake. I now own two copies and will never do business with Amazon again,"
4,Beethoven Piano Sonatas,Excellent. Backhaus has a true sensitivity for this fantastic music of the conmposer. Fine recording.
4,Eureka Vac really sucks,"After reading all the reviews about various vacuums and looking in stores at available vacuums I was extremely disappointed in the offerings. Some vacuums are priced as if the were new cars and others priced low enough to be attractive except that I am not into cheap chinese made plastic 99cent store appearance which eliminated most in the price range I wanted to spend. I found this vacuum while shopping through Amazon and after reading the reviews I thought it might work. It is pretty much the standard old gonna last a while vacuum. It does not come with any gadgets for furniture or curtains or spider webs, it is just the basic floor vacuum. It works very well on carpet but has drawbacks on rugs as it pulls them up off the floor because it has power. The chord is very long which is a plus and the construction of the thing is satisfactory. The height adjustmant is adequate for various carpet types."
2,Not worth buying by any measure,"I don't understand how this vacuum has such great reviews. Sure, it has a lot of metal parts. So what? It still works terribly.My main gripe is that this vacuum cannot clean hard floors. It will kick dirt and debris around all over the place though. Try vacuuming a hard floor bare footed and you will actually FEEL the debris hitting your feet as they are shot around.On carpet, this vacuum does better, but again, it will still kick dirt around.I want a vacuum that will suck dirt and debris up, not fling it around everywhere.Also, I'm not sure if this is due to our having dogs in the house, but whenever I use this vacuum, it immediately disperses a terrible smell consisting of hair, dander, and dirt. I'm not really experienced with different vacuums, but it seems to me that they shouldn't do this.I do not recommend buying this vacuum."
4,work horse,We seek these vacuums out for their durability. Our vacuums get used in a collegiate atmosphere and thus are abused rather than used. They hold up extremely well and we are able to get replacement parts at our local repair shop.
2,home owner,"I bought this product be cause of the reviews, but I found they weren't correct, this vaccum is a pile of junk, it is noisey, it is hard to push, and it dumps the things it picks up back on the carpet or floor, the only thing good about this machine is the cord at least they were smart enough to put a decent cord on it, The next time I will buy at a local store, at least I can tell them in person what a bad product they have"
1,I hate this vacuum!,We bought this vacuum a little over 2 years ago. AT FIRST I loved it. It is very heavy..but it did do a good job. Now that we have stairs to go up it made me not even want to vacuum because it was so heavy to carry up the steps and awkward to carry. We have a german shepard who sheds a lot and it just can't keep up with the fur. The handle doesnt release anymore easily. I have to literally bang it off the ground to get it to release and sometimes even that doesn't work. Changing the bag doesn't do anything for picking up the fur and nothing is clogged in the brushes. I am going to TRY to contact the customer service dept but I'm sure we're past the warranty period. But I just used those words last night to my husband that I hate this vacumm!! I bought a Kemore Quick Clean last night and I love it and it was half the price of this. Amazing on the pet hair. I can't believe what the eureka was leaving behind. Unbelievable! Buy a kenmore instead and save!!
1,"Cover states ""24 hits"" and there are actually only 12.","Vocals are just like I remembered Hank Ballard. I only wish all 24 songs were available. The one that got me was (#21) ""Someday We'll Be Together Again"" and the CD stops at the 12th song. Very disappointed so I'm sending it back hoping to receive a copy containing all 24 songs. I've always loved anything Hank Ballard sang. He has a quality in his voice unmatched by anyone ever in this lifetime of mine. Very grabbing to the heart."
1,TOTAL RIP OFF,Blatant fraud! Advertises 24 songs and delivers 12! Will never buy another Hank Ballard album in ANY format!
2,watch some of the lyrics if your kids are young,"My daughter asked for this cd after seeing it advertised on nickelodeon. While most of it is fine, specifically the Veronica's song talks about spending the night with a guy and giving him the ""ride of his life"". Not really what I had in mind for my 9 yr old!"
4,really good,"girl next is a great cd for tweens & teens. The only reason i rated it 4 stars was 2 of the songs(Fool & 4ever) said things like you asked me over 4 a drink or 2. And, next thing i know i woke next 2 u. then in 4ever it said i want 2 spend the night with u,we can make this night last 4ever. so its not a c.d for young kids. but otherwise it's a REALLY good c.d. with great songs!"
4,A few really good Songs,"I really liked a few of the tracks.I bought the CD for the ""Material Girls"" song, but found that my favorite track on the CD is ""Outside Looking In"" sung by Jordan Pruitt. I found myself liking Jodan Pruitt's singing a lot more than any other artist on the Album.I like the ""Cinderella"" Song, performed by the Cheetah Girls, but I prefer the version done by the group Play.I have always liked the lyrics to this song a lot, and the tune is o.k.The version of Material Girls, performed by Hilary and Haylie, is not any better than (not even as good as) the version done by Madonna, and not much different. Madonna may be much more talented than Hilary and Haylie, but I still like Hilary's and Haylie's voices a lot.Some of the other songs I really liked are:BreakawayWhen There Was Me and You"
3,Some good and some bad songs,"Some good songs were on here like (Cinderella, Ultraviolet, Your New Girlfriend, Outside Looking In, and Material Girls) and there were some bad songs like, ""4Ever"" and ""Fool""In ""Fool"" she said, ""..You invited me over for a drink or two....And next thing I knew, I woke up next to you"" and in ""4Eer it says, "".. and I wanna spend the night with you, with you, with you, come we tonight we can make this night last forever...""I guess this CD is OK. I dont' listen to it much."
3,TRAM Marine Antenna,"I bought this for a small boat used mainly near land, I didn't want an 8 foot long antenna. Mast is good, base is cheap, missing SS nuts and no instructions for funky base adjustment!"
1,Tram Antenna,This antenna and mount are of very cheap quality. The mount broke on mine on the third time out. I can not recomend that this be used for any type of boating in other than perfect conditions.. ( no wave action.) For a stationary mount to the side of a building it may be ok.
5,This book was the bomb.com,"This was a very helpful book that was very well written. I would highly recommend it to any Network Admin or anybody just wanting to learn more. It didn't only focus on CISCO products, but on the generic products used. It not only explained routers, switches, etc. it explained Network Managment, and other useful tools. This book also gave good troublshooting tips and also came with Network Blueprints. I was very impressed and will look for more books by this publisher."
5,"A well-written, thorough book.","This book is a great resource for covering the basics of all aspects of WANs. As a Network Engineer getting into WANs, it filled in all of the holes. A fantastic reference for people who realize there is more to working with computers than certification study guides."
5,Best Cisco Introduction book,"This is my first Cisco book, summarises Cisco's 2.5"" huge Product Catalogue in a nutshell. And this is a comment from an IT (non network) manager. Someone had recommended Ballew's/O'Reilly's book but unfortunately dropped it halfway through when this book came out.Cisco recent announcements to go global means expansion into WAN internetworking, AVVID, etc. So could Tom continue into a second volume, with more practical and deeper issues, case studies, and even comparisons with other vendors (ie Nortel, Lucent, Extreme etc) ? Cannot think any reader not giving this book 5 stars.This is for non technicians as much as Lammle is to CCNA and CCDA certification. It's particularly precious in this part of the world where up to date English IT books are a rarity.Good stuff and well done."
5,"Excellent overview of not just Cisco, but also networking","I bought this book before I began working for Cisco, and it really helped me understand the fundamentals of networking. Everything is explained in plain-english --- perfect for those starting out in the field."
5,***SIX*** Stars!,Finally . . . a book that speaks to mere mortals. Well written with good explanations. The authors provide a good balance of technical information while presenting the information in a real-world context. A FANTASTIC place to begin understanding the Cisco line and routing in general.
3,Medium book,"This is an OK book, not as great as everyone says. Not good at all if you are pursuing Cisco Ceritificaion unless you use this simply just to start out and then buy another guide that does what this book does anyway's."
3,laser detector,"It worked right out the box, but I wish I would have known it only works with a pulse beam laser(which nobody could tell me) thanks Dewalt. It did not work with my line beam laser so i returned it."
3,I like em.... but...,"These shoes are definitely unique. They seem rather long and narrow, but that is the look they are going for. I have not worn these shoes very often, finding the right occasion for these dressy/casual shoes can be difficult to decide. I find they comfortable and really like the Bacco Bucci brand of shoes. I will definitely proudly wear these many many times, may not appeal to all though..."
1,Sunwa 7 funstion 16 Range Analog Multimeter,This is another piece of garbage imported from China. Unit worked for about 2 weeks. Do not buy this item for any reason.
2,A shame,"I liked its design (appearance) and the fact that it could play just about any media I own, from vinyl to CDs. I plugged it in and turned on the radio - sounded good and got good reception, even of hard-to-get stations. Put in a CD - could not read three out of four discs. I popped in a tape - noticeable deterioration of sound quality. Ah well. I put on a record - sound quality plummeted! At that point it sounded like distant music broadcast from a tin can. Since I'd bought it primarily to play records, I returned it to the store the next day."
1,disapointed,Well at first the package arrived it was damaged and so was the product we sent it back to have them fix it and they have contacted us back!
1,dishonest and damaged,This item was advertised as new but arrived not only in a damaged box but it had obviously been used as all the safety packaging pieces were missing and there was graffiti type writing in permanent black marker all up and down the front of the unit!!!!! I couldn't believe it!!! as it would be more of a hassle and expense to return it (& there were no instructions on how to return it if necessary and no packing slip) i kept the item and now have a graffiti damaged stereo unit when i mostly chose to purchase this unit for it's appearance. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again!!!!
2,"Looks bood, but . . .","We received the grill and it looks great. However, a lot of heat escapes and it is very difficult to control the cooking speed/heat. It is nearly impossible to restrict the airflow.We would not purchase this item again."
1,To be Stale or Not to be Stale,Hard as a Rock.. Would never soften.. Only two months from freshness date :( . I had bought this brand before from oldfashionedcandy.com and it way amazingly firm yet chewy. I only baught from this new site because it was a couple of dollars cheaper in price. :( aww maaan. Now it is hard for me too get back my refund. I shipped back product all by myself through another carrier all paid.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in the ropes. They were tough to eat. If I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds, they were pretty good. I did get a response from the seller, and they said that they were in a warehouse, and due to the cold weather, they were firmer. The ropes were within their expiration --or shelf life date. I probably will not order them again."
3,Prerequisites of DTV: The revolution in Electronic Imaging,"This book by Jerry Whitaker requires a AAS in electronic Engeneering Technology and/or a understanding of TV, DVD Sattelitte, or Computers to grasp the techniques of digital decoders and encoders. Knowledge of Binary 1's and 0's in different size bytes is essential. Series to parallel conversion and digital to analog conversion is necessary to understand the manipulation of the serial data in the encoders transmission basics, and the compression and expansion of parallel data , with memory manipulation of the order of the frames of the raster. Digital Television Fundamentals:Design and Installation of Video and Audio Systems: by Michael Robin and Michel Poulin is an excellent prerequisite and follow up book to this one. The same requirements of digital data techniques are necessary... This book does not include the new decoder circuits used for transmitting and compressing the digital data, nor the circuitry of the monitors."
3,A good preview for newcomers to the field,"The book covers many issues in DTV as well as TV and video in general. It seems that it was intended for those who would like to go wide but not deep into details. There are 4 pages describing general A/D & D/A, but only few short paragraphs for the Trellis Decoder and Data De- Interleaver of the ATSC standard. I expected to find in this book more about the new standards and less about the general background."
2,head hunters,"way too intellectual. hard to read and I can not even get through the first few chapters. Too bad, I really wanted to have an inside look into the making of the album."
1,RIPOFF!,"Amazon needs to add negative stars.These clipboards SUPPOSEDLY cost $0.19 each - what they DON'T tell you is that the shipping is outrageous!!! I was going to order 12 of these clipboards. The total cost of the clipboards was $2.28. When I was looking over the order before clicking on the PLACE ORDER button, I was startled to see that the cost of shipping was over $53!!!!!! Don't shop with these people. Look elsewhere."
1,Axiom: Save your time and money,"I bought this book with hopes that it would be good reading during my vacation. I ended up watching CNN instead. How is this book bad?1. No plot development or feasible links between actions.2. No character development. Characters are irrational to the point of seeming to be bi-polar.3. Drop all of the gratuitous ""F"" and ""S"" words and loose 5-10% of the book.4. Too many pointless and inappropriate discussions of the virtues/evils of conservatives and liberals. I was expecting an entertaining survival tale, not fifty repetitions of the author's political philosophy."
1,A waste of time and money.,"This book is poorly researched, poorly written and completely unbelieveable. The poetry is even worse. I regret the time I wasted with this book and only wish to spare others the experience. John Carter, our hot headed hero, leaves the murdered corpses of two of his children and his wife in a pile in the bedroom of his house and ventures out to save the world. Within 24 hours from the time his wife and children's blood began to coagulate on the bedroom floor he was in orgasmic bliss with a prostitute who politely declined his kiss as to not offend him with her foul breath resulting from her last customer. Gee, what a guy, what a gal, what a story. Believe me it gets much worse. If you are considering purchasing this book, save your money."
4,Long live the Queen (Lucia)!,"This is the first of Benson's books on ""Lucia"" that I have read, however I have seen ""Mapp and Lucia"" on DVD - which is a riot and if you like the ""Lucia"" books, you really need to see this on DVD.I think sometimes that the English have a very different sense of humor from us Yanks. I just happen to be a person who ""gets"" the British humor and that's why I enjoyed this Kindle book so much. I will get the others available now - can't wait!"
1,"Awful, no redeeming interest whatsoever","eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. Emmeline Lucas aka La Lucia rules the social life of her small English town and exemplifies, in her own mind at least, a cultural ideal.What a perfectly horrible story. Lucia is self-centered, self-satisfied, and smug to boot. Her husband is content to have their world revolve around her and their joint ideas of culture. The townspeople share their warped tastes. A satire should be amusing; this was just pathetic. I couldn't get far into it before throwing it away in disgust."

5,great CD cheaper than buying from Itunes,"Im happy with the CD, however when it arrived the case was broken, so you cant keep the outside of the case on. postage was pretty slow (1 month+) compared to other purchases"
5,I can't wait for the sequel.,Troma is going to spoof themselves and make a more outrageous spoof on their own film. It will be called Bukkakeman instead of Kabukiman. It will be hilarious.
3,Not the best,I loved Sgt.Kabukiman in the Toxic Avenger. I was excited they had a movie about the guy and so I checked it out. All I can say is Sgt. Kabukiman is better off in the Toxic Avenger films or in the extra's on various Troma dvds. The film is not as good as other Troma films but worth watching. I think the one thing people love about it is the theme song.
3,Great little vacuum if you can stand the noise.,"Light, powerful, easy to use, but noisy as ...returned it after just one use and went with the Bissell Powerglide series. The Bissell Powerglide is much quieter."
1,0 stars would be more appropriate,"A complete waste of money. Specifics:- Lacks suction power, passes over dirt or spits it out the back. Small dirt suction opening clogs easily. Tool hose clogs easily.- Difficult to use tools. Hard to attach tool hose to vac even harder to unattach. Requires a jerk to loosen from vac. Then needs to be turned 180 degrees to restore on back of vac. Some tool attachments store loosly and fall off, others store too tight. Attachments come loose from each other when vacuuming with them.- Cumbersome cord storage on back. Even though it has turnable lever to release cord it has two small tabs on the cord storage that continue to hold cord in after lever is turned..."
1,Piece of c...p!,"I can't believe they sell such a piece of c...p!After inserted the 9V battery, I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time, and I heard a cracking noise right away. One piece of the mechanism fell off, and I could hear it when shaking the box. Of course, the shuffler was broken... Wished I could have read the first comment before buying that piece of c...p in some store."
3,You get what you pay for,"This product is great for those who don't play cards much, but hates to shuffle. It is loud and jams easily, but in the long run gets the job done."
1,??What is it???,"Is this a DVD movie or is it a dvd of the broadway play ... like they did for ""Cats""..........because THATS what I am looking for.......... dont want to spend the $$$ if its something I dont want!!!! Any help or ideas???????"
5,buy this one ASAP,"you will not find a book with more advise, even if you are under 50... it's incredible what basic steps we forget to take but Bob Dilenschneider reminds us in a very thoughtful volume that should be read by everyone."
2,Nothing spectacular at all,"Although the author has written this e book very well, there's nothing spectacular since the information given is availabe all over the internet for free.In fact google returns more links and more information than given in this book. The two links described in the book are too well known to even kids."
4,It's A Good Book,"I Really Think that it is a decent book, although some of the things may have been better explained. But, all around a good one."
5,This book is so awesome,I love reading Selena so much I would rather read a book about Selena than go to school.I think all ages should read this book.she was famous for her singing.I admire her so much.I love for you to read it and admire her as much as I do.
5,Great for grading,The rod is great with the Dewalt rotary lasar. Easy to read numbers and simple to use. Raises and lowers well.
2,not one of Charlie's better efforts,"it's tough to knock such a great guy, but when Charlie Harper isn't collaborating with Nicky Garrat & Alvin Gibbs, the UK Subs just aren't the UK Subs. It's merely Charlie and some hired hands that tool around Europe, drunk and ranting. if you do like the late 80's/early 90's version of the UK Subs, then you may appreciate this. But if you've heard their first 4 albums, or even the excellent 20th anniv duo of Quintessentials and Riot, then you've heard the best the UK Subs have to offer. I guess the bonus live cd is a plus, but in this case only the diehards need apply."
2,There is Bonus Ballet as it claims on this DVD,"I just bought this DVD two weeks ago after I read all the excellent review. This DVD calims it has 45 minutes of bonus of ballet which I would imagine the same as I watched live-broadcast on new year. However NO ballet on the DVD at all. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the Ballet go on the DVD - it's not on IT. It was such a surpise to me because the main reson I bought this DVD instead of its CD version of the concert is that I really like the Ballet (from the live - broadcast on new year's concert).I like products of this recording company ""Deutsche Grammophon"" and I have many CD collections from this company. I just couldn't figure out why this is happenning!!! I was disappointed even though the music was excellent."
4,"Love, Women, Lust and Violence!","The Author weaves a suspenseful tale of true love between two women and the abuse of one. From steamy acts of lesbian love to the abusive, violent act of a jealous husband against a pregnant wife and her lover. This is one you won't be able to put down from beginning to end!"
2,Don't bother,"I thought this was a book. It's more like a large pamphlet. In my opinion, if you pay this much for a ""book"", you should get a book. It reminds me of when I was a kid and had those ""pop up"" books. Has pretty pictures but no substance. If you want to learn about your VFR...read your manual."
2,he missed a whole catagory of Interceptor,i am the owner of a 1985 VF1000R Interceptor. i found this book/pamphlet on the Interceptor and was very excited. i ordered it but to my dismay there is only a half-paragraph mention of the VF1000R Honda Interceptor - go figure!! the VF1000R was a landmark bike when it came out - it put the Interceptor on the map!! and this guy doesn't even mention it! perhaps his cat hit the delete key while sleeping on the keyboard and erased the chapter on the VF1000R.it's a tiny book and worth about half what it's currently selling for. (the Hong Kong press that it was printed on can't be _THAT_ expensive)it is pretty informative and a quick history in the VFR motorcycles. there's not much out there on these bikes so you just have to take what you can get!
3,"weird taste for me, but good product and company","bought from reading 'the plan' book, it's a recommendation for Health, but prefer pills myself. As they say 'to each their own'."
2,Not enough tea in the bag.,This is the weakest tea. You can see inside the bag and there is only a teeny amount of tea in the bag. I use to bags to make one cup. Would not recommend this brand.
1,Not actually a pack of 24,"Note that, despite being called ""Norpro 422D Glass Measuring Shot Glasses (Pack of 24)"", including a description that says it is a display pack of 24, and being priced ridiculously high for a single glass, you are actually only buying one shot glass here. Other items on Amazon are a much better deal."
2,Buyer Beware,"I can echo all of the same comments other users have about this vacuum. From the burning smell of the beater bar to the wallowing cannister to finding the special bags it all adds up to an expensive mistake. Why haven't appliance makers been able to ""get it together"" by now?"
1,"Eureka !! , I've found it, A piece of JUNK!","I purchased mine when they were merging with Electrolux so mine has an Electrolux cogged drive belt which eureka nor any service center knows about. You got it, my belt broke after 2 weeks of use. The customer service people at eureka are all about 16 years of age and know nothing. The supervisors are nearing 18 and know less. Bottom line no help at all. As far as eureka is concerned, my model does not exist. Buyer BEWARE, purchase anything but a eureka product. I purchased a Bissel for one third the price, all the parts are readily available, and it works great."
2,I hate this vacuum,"It is big and bulky to pull around, the hose gets twisted, the wand will not stay up and broke. It seems to vacuum okay but I absolutely hate using it. I'm exhausted by the time Im done. We have hardwood floors and this was the top recomended product. Waste of a lot of money."
1,Same problems!!!,"I thought maybe my machine had a unique problem, but it is the same as everyone else's. Burning smell, belt constantly breaking and finally, the melting end pieces. I took it to an authorized repair place and was charged for a new roller even though it is the design that is obviously flawed. The repairman said the problem is that I am vacuuming up too must hair and the solution is to not vacuum up so much hair. Unreal! Eureka refuses to back up their product. By the way, I did some extensive research myself and spent the extra money on something a little better that average, the only reason to buy this machine is the power head and it is critically flawed. Any machine can have good suction, just buy a shop vac for a lot less money, but without the power head, this unit is just a super expensive dust broom."
4,Worth a look,This is an excellent product for the money. It compares well to more expensive European canisters. A good assortment of tools comes with the vacuum at no extra charge. The suction is strong and adjustable. The carpet head has a separate motor and lifts dirt from the carpeting effectively. The wand to the carpet head is plastic and does not feel as solid as the metal wands on a Miele but the cord is nicely integrated. If you're shopping for a high end vacuum and are looking to the European canisters this one will do everything they do for a fraction of the cost!
1,I'v e changed my mind.,"I entered this website with full intentions of buying a Eureka 6984A Canister Vacuum Cleaner on the spot. However, after reading several reviews about burning smells, poor design and poor performance, I will not be purchasing this model. Thanks to those who took the time to report their experiences with this machine. I am disappointed, but will continue to look for a more satisfactory cleaner."
2,worked well at first but broke after 6 mos of light use...,"I liked this vacuum at first. It cleaned well when it worked. Here are my problems:1. The canister easily overturns when trying to move around corners. It needs two swivel wheels or needs to be balanced better.2. After a few months of use, the carpet attachment started to squeak from what sounded like the wheels. Annoying for a product that is only a few months old.3. A few months later, only 6 short months after the unit was purchased, the carpet attachment quit. The brush won't turn because it is rubbing plastic on plastic. It is poorly constructed. It smells like burnt rubber when I try to use the carpet attachment. You will notice that the canister is made in Sweden but the wand and floor/carpet attachments are made in China. They should have spent a few more dollars and had the entire thing made in Sweden."
2,Very disappointed,"At first we were very happy: the suction on the vac is very strong, the roller also very effective, and the hepa filtration seemed to be working perfectly. Within a week or two the wheels on the powernozzle began to squeak. And now, just a little under two months(!) after we bought it, the roller brush is not working at all. Because the design of the roller is to have plastic end pins inserted in and spinning in a plastic holder, they wear, get hot and melt. What a teribble design. Maybe the better metal roller on the more expensive Eurekas work better, but this one seems to be fatally flawed. Not recommended except, perhaps, if you have little or no rugs and carpet to do. But why pay for such an expensive powernozzle then?"
1,Eureka 6984A,"The Eureka worked fine at first. Now, with medium use, the beater brush started smelling like it was burning. It became terribly noisy and my wife shut it off. I have just read some other complaints here by people having the same problem. Want to know what kind of guarantee this has and if anything can be done. Ours was bought only EIGHT months ago and we have no children and or heavy traffic on our carpets. We use it infrequently.Our previous Eureka lasted over 12 years!This is really bad news.Bill Schulze"
1,don't buy this vacuum,"Where do I start? First off it tips very easily. One tug on the hose and it flips over on it's back like a dead beetle.Secondly, the power brush isn't powerful enough to spin. Never mind the hi/medium/low pile carpet settings. I use it on low pile commercial grade loop carpet and the spinner barely spins when set on high. If it is set on medium or low the spinner doesnt spin at all and the air smells with the foul smell of burning rubber.Eureka used to be known as a high quality vacuum, or so I thought. After this experience I'm moving on to antoher brand."
1,this tangled vacuum,"I bought this about 6 months ago, have been searching for bags for the past month...guess I will order them on line. This vacuum gets tanngled every time I use it..cannot go 5 feet without having to get the cord untangled from itself. Additonally, this vaccum smells like burning dust all the time during use.Try something else!"
1,what a disappointment,This map comes as a single sheet (as most maps do) however only one side is printed on. All of South Korea is represented and highlights the various interets in the country. I am surprised that while roads and highways are represented on the map they are NOT labled. Furthermore I am equally surprised that an extremely poor map of Seoul is given with very little detail. The roads in Korea can be confusing and with no labels you are being set up for failure if you try and drive here. No subway map is given and what a shame as Seoul has a great subway system but many of the maps in the subway stations are in korean. You would be better off printing a map off the internet than wasting your time with this map. What a sham!
4,Provocative and Scholarly,"This is a relatively short but provocative book about the myth vs. reality vis-a-vis our ideas about ancient Israel. Philips systematically approaches the topic with chapters entitled ""Defining the Biblical Israel,"" ""The Social Context of the Biblical Israel,"" ""Who Wrote the Biblical Literature, and Where,"" and ""How was the Biblical Literature Written, and Why?"" He indicates that the book is designed for ""students"" and this may explain the dearth of notes and more extensive documentation that scholars may expect. On the other hand, the level of writing is sufficiently advanced to suggest the book only to serious or advanced students. This isn't a book for the general public."
4,Where Were You When The Lights Went Out?,"OVERLOAD by Linda HowardBlackout! The entire Southeast was without power - but there was still more than enough electricity between Elizabeth Major and Tom Quinlan! They were stranded together in a Dallas high rise for the duration - and setting off enough sparks to light up the darkest night.HOT COPY by Carole BuckHotshot newswriters Mitch Nelson and Christy Kavanaugh had loved their way through the big blackout of 1977. So imagine their surprise when they were reunited to cover the great lights-out of '93. All thoughts of keeping things cool were doused along with the lights!STEAM BATH by Suzanne CareyThe elevator didn't work and neither did the air-conditioning, so prim-and-proper Melisande Taylor was stuck in a sweaty office with the man not of her dreams - sexy, irritating Joe Carbone. And Jose had a lot more on his mind than passing the time with boring conversation..."
3,Fun for the troops,I saw this two films on the internet and found them to be very campy and hilarious. So I sent them to our daughter in Iraq and her friends. Good service from Amazon.
4,Silly and Fun,"It is more witty than many parodies that have been tried, the acting, casting and writing work well and it does have rocket ships, the moon and enjoyably bad ""future"" gadgets.If you sometime enjoy ""silly"" (Monty Python, Laugh-In), as I do, this might fit your bill for Popcorn night. Surprised me....Best,Joe"
3,Monarch of the Moon,This was an attempt to take a humorous approach to good old fashion sci fi serials that were shown at the movies many years ago. Unfortunately it was too overstated and lost some of its humour due to a lack of subtlety.Monarch of the MoonThere are plenty of other similar movies that work better.
5,Great Wireless Bridge,I'm using the Netgear WGE101 to contect to a Netgear WGR614 router/switch which in turn is connected to a cable modem for internet access. It works flawslessly with 99% signal strength at 40 feet and several walls between the two devices. The security features that you can use with the combined Netgear setup is really outstanding.
5,Works great with the Netgear WGT624,"I just picked up the WGE101 from zoomfly.com, it works great. DIdn't have a difficult time setting it up, everything went smoothly."
1,Didn't work for me,"This product didn't work for me. It refuses to communicate with my Linksys 802.11g Access Point/Router box. According to press reports other people have seen the same problem and the Netgear firmware in the WGE101 box seems to be at fault. What's odd is a Netgear 802.11g USB adapter works fine with the Linksys access point.The Netgear bridge did work with the Netgear WGR614 access point, but I had to stop using the Netgear access point because it locked up every few days for some unknown reason.Given my experiences with the WGE101 and WGR614 boxes, I think Netgear isn't up to speed yet on 802.11g technology."
2,Trite,"""Battlespace"" continues the far-flung adventures of the Marines, this time investigating the disappearance of a previous expedition. The strength of Douglas is in creating interesting, albeit rather predictable, characters. However, Garroway (the protagonist) holds few, if any, suprises, and while being somewhat likable, is rather two-dimensional. I was disappointed that the author doesn't develop relationships to any great degree, with most characters being little more than ships passing in the night.Both ""Star Corps"" and ""Battlespace"" revolve to a greater or lesser extent around the mythical ""Hunters of the Dawn"" - a race that thrives by dispatching up-and-coming species. It is against this backdrop that ""Battlespace"" takes place - and it is because of this backdrop that the ease with which the marines dispatch the Xul ends this book in a most unfulfilling way. Overall, readable in a couple of evenings, but not memorable."
4,Good Read,"Good continuation of the storyline... starting to get off into imagination a little more, and starting to get pretty unbelievable"
4,Fun read,"If you liked the first, you'll like the rest of the series. Ian Douglas is like W.E.B. Griffin with a brain."
4,Actually Good,"this book and book one of the legacy trilogy are better than the fisrt 3 books, the author has certainly done better this time around"
5,"Battlespace (The Legacy Trilolgy, Bk 2)","This book in an addition to my SciFi book collection, very good space action book.Alway good to read about new worlds and aliens."
4,Fast-paced fun read,"When I started to read Book 2 I knew I should have started with Book 1, although one can get a firm sense of what transpired previously. Suffice it to say, I bought the trilogy (after the fact) and thoroughly enjoyed the story. If you enjoy Weber's Honor series, you will likely enjoy Douglas."
5,love him,This was a great purchase!! fell in love with it!! Speedy service and no hassles! will definitely re-order and great recommendation!!!
3,Not quite as funny...,"It seems like Kevin kicked off a tour without writing enough material to actually fill a one-hour show. And his previously material was better, before his kids became a major topic in his act, which has some decent material, but not as good as the adult humor he used to do. And it dragged -- lots of ""down-time"" / set-up talk that does nothing to make you laugh.All-in-all, some funny stuff, but it is almost a chore to sit through the whole thing waiting for the occasional nugget.The replays of the Martin Lawrence show currently airing on Starz, featuring random 5-minute acts from amateurs is a lot funnier than this..."
3,Seriously not that funny,This comedy movie was just okay. A few laughs here and there. I just I don't find most stand-up to be funny enough for an entire movie. Maybe his next movie will be better.
5,WAY better than I thought,"His comedy DVD before this one (grown little man) was HILARIOUS, so I didn't think that he could follow it with a funny DVD, but he did. This thing was surprisingly hilarious. There's this chest joke that had my friend & I in tears laughing. My ONLY complaint is that it's not 2 hours long, but that way too long to be doing a stand-up routine...I'm just being greedy. This was great though."
2,OK,"kevin has got a little better with standup. its a bit dry. movie had its funny moments, but definately not a classic."
5,TOO FUNNY,"Always makes me laugh.You don't even need to read reviews: Believe me, it will be worth it."
4,Funniest Thing Ever,This was really funny to me. If you thought this was funny then you will also like Kevin Hart: I'm A Grown Little Man. He also clowns on Shaq .
3,Funny if you haven't seen any of his work before...,"I LOVE Kevin Hart, but because this was basically the same thing as watching ""I'm a Grown Little Man"", it left me disappointed. I'd wished I'd seen it before I purchased it. He also tells the same jokes in the All Star Comedy Jam, which features more comedians."
1,Seriously NOT FUNNY.,"Didnt have me laughing but I saw the ppl in the audience laughing uncontrolably. I dont think it was funny AT ALL. Just MY opinion, of course. But I was straightfaced throughout the whole thing."
1,I'm not but....,"When someone says ""I'm not a BLANK but..."" that only proves they are.It's a shame that this has hate speech in the first 10 minutes I had really wanted to give this guy a shot at being funny but I cannot let people I care about be subjected to such a thing as this nightmare tries to be."
1,paid but still havent recieved my video,i order this product a month ago and still havent received it yet. so with that being said i'm not to happy.
5,Hilarious!,"Kevin Hart is the funniest person alive. He makes me snort, cackle, clap my hands, etc. He is hysterical & I can't wait for the new DVD to be released in January. My face & stomach hurt from laughing so hard. <3"
3,just ok,"Had not heard of kevin, I thought it was somewhat funny but the show became repetitive and lost my inteterst"
5,Kevin Hart: Seriously Funny,I couldn't stop laughing at Kevin. He is so funny to me. This is a good buy for anyone who loves to laugh.
3,this dvd was alright,this dvd wasnt too bad but it wasnt all that funnyhe do have some funny partsit couldve been better
1,Really? this is humour?,Try out Mr. Universe for stand up comedy that will make you laugh and is not filled with negativity and foul language. Although the humour is more about mundane experiences and not the gritty life that Kevin Hart portrays at least I don't have to be exposed to unadulterated vulgarity. After 5 minutes I shut it off and watched 'Happy' instead.
1,Not Funny,"Perhaps it is a sign of the times, but comedy has evolved from Red Skelton, to Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and now, Kevin Hart. The evolution from no profanity to profound profanity (Murphy) has in some cases made comedy funnier and better. However, this entertainer simply isn't funny. Now, I know comedy, like music, is a personal taste. What I find funny others won't. Music I like. . .others won't. But, go back and watch Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy and when you have tears rolling down your face from laughing so hard you can't breathe, you realize how little talent is displayed here. It is titled, ""Seriously Funny."" The joke is on us. He just doesn't show us the talent his predecessors had for making us laugh. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. I don't think I even SMILED watching this. It is that NOT funny."
4,First good laugh in a long time.,I laughed because I could relate to it being a father and husband. I honestly expected more vulgarity (having been used to Eddie Murphy and others) but even though there is some it's all in good fun. Very good show that I would watch again.
4,Good stuff,"Kevin Hart at his best. His style of delivery is refreshing because he provides quite a bit of background to his stories. I think this helps with the delivery of the jokes. Needless to say, I was laughing throughout the whole set."
3,Movie Ok,I thought the movie was new material however I had previously seen it. Still worth watching when you in need of a good laugh
4,"Not everything made out to be, but definately worth a read.","This man is a salesman, which means first he sells himself,which he does quite succesfully in this book, a bit to the detrimentof the book. It makes it appear that anyone can go to people with a pretty good product and have it sell. It may sell, but a years worth of 60 hour work weeks isn't worth $10,000.Found his little tricks like counting competitive products on the shelves, and other stuff, very useful. Resources are OK but have a larger variety as compared to other invention books. Throughout the book he stress low cost and investors, which to me seem contradictory, although his information on both is good. Not much of what makes a good product and clear steps to bring items to market.For those I recomend Marketing Your Invention by Mosley and Winning At New PRoducts by Robert Cooper.Overall this book is worth buying and reading."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"As a first-time product inventor and longtime Webpreneur, I found Debelak's book both refeshingly creative and rooted in solid business principles that will help usher entrepreneurs along the right product development path -- continually arming them throughout the process with tips and tools to test (and re-test) the validity of a new business idea as it moves to market.Bringing Your Product to Market is chock full of litmus-test-type checklists and common-sense (yet far from obvious) ideas, such as reaching out to product packaging specialists to get a more accurate forecast of how many units a product might sell.In short, this is a **must read** for anyone serious about introducing something new or unique into the marketplace.I'm eager to continue putting Don's tenets to work (and the test) and am moving on to a more formalized product testing stage. Stay tuned for more case study updates!"
3,Not all that bad.,"Some of Mortiis' more mediocre work. If you liked anything from Fata Morgana, or the Selvmord album, I'd recommend this. Track 1 isn't the greatest track and it, as a whole, can get a little reptative, but it is good never the less. Not genius, but good."
5,Best book on meditation yet!,"Clark Strand cuts right to the heart of meditation, without dogma, gurus, religion, beliefs, or any of the other gunk that gets in the way of sincere and honest practice. In a beautiful style reminiscent of Thich Nhat Hanh, Strand has created the ideal meditation companion and guide. While Strand is probably among the few teachers who would never invite a following, he most certainly deserves one. If you read no other book on meditation, read this one. If you have other books on meditation, put them on the back shelf and read this one. If you have never meditated before and want a book to teach you how, read this one. This is the only meditation guide you will ever need. It is superb!"
2,A Let Down,"I had high hopes for this book, but was very disappointed. Being an individualist, I hoped this book would provide information on getting more out of meditation without seeking any kind of teacher. I was disappointed because this book lacks any spiritual heart. If you are looking for a book that strips meditation of its spiritual content, and is repackaged for a consumer society, then buy this book. If you seek a book that delves into the spiritual aspect of meditation, then look elsewhere."
2,Yesterday's News,"I did not find much value in this book, aside from the chapter on teams. I think this book is valued because it was one of the first books written on the subject of new product development (NPD). But the theories and insights are out of date. Instead, read Dr. Cooper's Winning at New Products, New Products Management by Crawford, and the PDMA Handbook."
4,Shield episodes to keep,A lot of good episodes that need not be missed for shielders put these in the do watch drawer.
2,Goodbye Mr. Jordan,"I like Julian Lennon, having bought and enjoyed Valotte, Help Yourself, and Photograph Smile. His gentle voice, harmonies, and piano certainly recall his father, but with his own perspective.Unfortunately, that perspective is missing here. In its place is Patrick Leonard, who served as producer and masterminded the transformation of Julian Lennon into a generic LA-glam guitar rocker. It doesn't work. Julian's voice is morphed through production to sound like a watered-down Bowie, singing over wailing processed LA guitar pyrotechnics and cheesy synth lines and beats.If I have described something you will like, by all means get this album. Otherwise I would move on."
1,Fire Fighter Knife with Molded Plastic Detail,"If this knife didn't have a sharp blade you would think it was a childs toy. The ""Fire Fighter"" detail on the knife is molded plastic. This is really a poor excuse of a knife and a rip off of our fire fighter family. I gave it 1 star because you can't give it a zero."
4,good practice,"it's been a while since I took the test, but this book was good practice problems. Gets you in the motion of about 6 minutes/problem. I didn't like the hints just under the problem statement. I would cheat and look at the hint. I put sticky paper over the hints to prevent cheating.I only used this 6min solutions and the ChERM manual and practice problems and passed on my first attempt"
2,decent,"I don't care for the book...it's not set up very well.The product was described correctly, but shipping took a long time."
1,Nearly unreadable,I had to review this book because it was shocking how poorly written this book is. The book is all over the place and follows no coherent structure. It was painful to have to try and learn from a book that feels as if it was written by half a dozen different authors that all had their own idea about how to go about the task.
5,Great delivery,"I bought this book for school, have not started the class yet but I got a book in great condition."
3,Too expensive.,"Shells are a dime a dozen practically so why pay so much for 3 shells? They smelled very chemically when they arrived and I boiled them before I put them in the tank. One also chipped when I dropped it on the counter when opening the package, not good if your crabs climb at all, as they always seem to fall off. I would have paid a couple dollars more to get a 30 pack and been happier with the quality."
3,Bad grammar in a grammar text. Buyer beware,"This grammar text is uninformed regarding the past perfect. It is an important tense and should not be overlooked, but you will have to go elsewhere for enlightenment. See erroneous definition on page 192 for substantiation of this well-founded opinion. Buyer Beware."
3,Takes Work to Use Example Code,"This book has lots of code snippets, but so many of them are out of context of actual usage (within class and standard modules) that the beginner is really left to READING about things rather than trying them. This is a mistake on the part of the Dummy editors. The authors need to give the beginning Dummy the ability to play with the code. It does no good to explain controls and then not provide the code to create the form or even provide the form for the reader to play with and practice. There are some sample files included, but they are far from useful and don't even follow the book. For example, the Chapter 6 Sales Tax form isn't included. I'd look for a book that gave you more examples for practice. Failing that, it's not a BAD book; it may take another book or two used along with this book which really defeats the concept of a Dummy book. Dummys need practice, not reading material."
5,Access VBA for Dummies Review,"The book is an easy read. It can be used as a starting guide for beginners or even a reference book for a little more experienced users. It can be read in full or in pieces, it is a great reference to have on hand while beginning and continuing projects. No complaints. I only wish there were some exercises in the book to go through."
3,Maybe a good place to start but no what I was looking for.,"Seemed ok at first, nice and easy, but quickly turned into just an introduction. The forms chapter was at the end of the book and very short. Forms are what access is all about. I was disappointed.dan"
5,.............Am I in Midgard anymore ?,I was so disappointed to find she has not written any more- The trilogy was full of everything you could possibly want in any story- The twins made the bridge and I just wanted to keep climbing it........... who knows if I'd still be in Midgard~
1,Strong and Awful,"My wife and I are huge fans of Chai Amore products. I've tried every flavor and I like them all with this one major exception. I agree with the other reviewer, this was undrinkable. I could not finish it and neither could my wife. Would wholeheartedly recommend all Chai Amore products other than this one. Stay away."
5,Keeps on going and going and going...,"My son received this toy for his first birthday, he is now 4 years old and still playing with this toy. Now his one year old sister has joined the fun and they love creating everything and anything with the blocks. I love how this is a toy that will last for several years and the kids do not outgrow it. This is something that will be around for a long time. Still looks like new!"
4,"Fun, but needs more blocks",My kids love this toy! The only problem is that there are not enough blocks that come with it to build much of anything. That was the first thing that my husband noticed. He told me that the kids were having so much fun playing with it but that I needed to buy more blocks when I went to the store b/c they did not have enough to really build anything.
5,Great Toy,This was one of my son's favorite gifts for his first birthday. He loves the wagon and will take every block out and then put them all back in...He can't quite build anything yet but I build things for him and loves to immediately tear them all apart.
5,Fun for boys and girls,This toy was purchased for my son when he was just over a year old. He's now 3 1/2 and he still plays with it all the time. His younger sister (17 months) loves to play with it too. They love to fill it up with different toys from around the house and take turns pulling it around. They also love to sit in it and pull each other around. This toy is very durable and we have had no problems with it at all. Very good value for the money.
4,Awesome for Kids,"It's really a cool toy for growing kids. Along with blocks, my kid store all his small toys in the dump wagon.Must buy!!!"
5,Perfect for a younger builder....,"These blocks are the perfect size for my littler builder who immediately made his first masterpiece moments after opening the wagon.... my only wish is that there were more blocks.He also appreciates having a ""handy storage"" place for his toys... the little guy is fastidious... (yes, I am blessed!) We play ""build"" and then ""throw the blocks into the basket"".... so the wagon can double for lots of things.The handle did fall off though it was easily reattached. I don't think its meant for ""heavy duty"" play."
4,"fun, but not good push toy","My almost-walking one-year-old throws the blocks all over the house; and he continuously tries to use it as a push-toy/walker, but it's far too lightweight for that purpose, and he falls down a lot. We go on lots of walks where he pushes the wagon and I pull the handle to keep the wagon from rolling away from him. If you want something that will keep your kid entertained in one spot, this is not the toy! Also, there are two ""people"" blocks with paint that comes off easily with sharp new baby teeth--the people blocks are made in China, and there is no notice that they are non-toxic, so I quickly took them away from my son."
3,Good toy but the wagon is dangerous,"I bought this toy for my 13-month old son. He loves playing with the blocks, and it's very durable. However, he also loves climbing into the wagon. It wasn't designed for toddlers to sit inside the wagon, but it's just the right size. The wagon has a way of tipping backward suddenly, and is especially dangerous if someone pulls it while a child is sitting inside. There is a tiny picture on the wagon showing that children are not meant to sit inside. I think that's a bit ridiculous. What child can resist climbing inside a wagon that is the perfect size? So, I'd have to say that I cannot recommend this wagon, only because children are very tempted to use it in ways it was not designed."
4,GREAT TOY,BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD SON HE LOVES IT BUILDS HAND CO-ORDINATION AND HELPS WITH HIS PATIENCE
1,Great idea bad execution,"I had been watching this toy for a long time hoping it might go on sale, but when we were going to the beach I decided to get it. My kids love the full size wagon and they loved the idea of having a little one they could play with inside. The main problem I have is the all the wheels don't turn, maybe mine was defective, but it makes it difficult to pull. The weight of the wagon is so light also that it easily lifts off the ground making it harder to pull. Maybe I just got a bad one, but with so much to do did not have time to return it. It sits in the corner, the kids don't even use it as they have learned it is simply a source of frustration."
5,wagon,I bought this little wagon w/blocks for my grandson who is just beginning to walk. He loves it! Put the blocks in! Take the blocks out! He likes to climb in himself and also to push the wagon from behind. Agood choice!
5,Really love this wagon!,"My son's NeNe got this for Christmas. He had to have it immediately, a week before! He's 14 months and I think its appropiate for his age. The blocks are the right size for his hands. There colorful, stackable, and very sturdy. I must say, he tries to get in the wagon, so I have to watch him. He can pull this around with his other toys. It's educational, fun, and I play with it too! =)"
5,Durable and imaginative,I purchased this wagon and block set for the nursery at our church. It is used by ages up to 24 months. They have another set of these block that stay in the middle of the floor because they are played with so much. Nice big size for little hands. IT's easy to get them to clean up ntoo since they love to fill the wagon!!
5,My son's favorite toy!,"The mega blocks are my 2 year old's favorite toy. It's one of the ones he uses every day. Had some for almost a year now, & he's not tired of them. Had to get some more when he started using them all. The wagon is fun, but nothing compared to the blocks. Mega blocks are a must have for toddlers."
5,Very Well LOVED!,"My dad got this for my son for his first birthday, and he is still playing with it and he is just over two years old. The pull handle has come off several times, and mommy has to ""fix"" it for him. Other than that, it is VERY durable. He sits on the wagon. He fills it up with his stuffed animals, cars, and other toys and pushes it around the house. You really need to have more blocks in order to do anything fun with the blocks. All in all, it is a great toy, and was a great gift."
4,Nice Surprise,"I recently came upon this album having heard they were a good post-Radiohead ""brit-pop"" band. I must say this is a really good cd throughout. I have yet to hear any of their other efforts, but based on this album alone I would reccomend this album to those interested in blur, radiohead, david gray, etc."
5,A Par Excellence in Brit Rock,"Travis is undoubtedly the best brit rock band of it's time. It combines simple melodies, inspired lyrics and excellent vocals in a blend that is satisfying to the ear and uplifting to the spirit. Fran Healy's strong voice shows through in such songs and Writing To Reach You and As You Are and his smart lyrics in Driftwood causes the listener to think. The whimsical She's So Strange delights the listener. The US did not do the album justice. A timeless work of lyrical art. ~dAb"
3,"Nice, but....","I am interested that so many people want to compare Travis to Radiohead, but apart from the voices and the fact that Travis' songs have the feel to Radiohead's more subdued, comtemplative songs, there are a number of differences.Travis are nice. If you're looking for a band that your Mother will like, here they are. There's nothing original, groundbreaking, cutting edge, harsh or hard. Travis play very nice songs, with an accoustic feel, which are a cut above most songs you hear. The main problem is that the album is too one paced. Where is the harshness to jolt you?Yes it is a good album, and I can see why it has sold in huge quantities, but let's stop the Radiohead comparisons."
4,Watch out..............,"Although this album is a brilliant one to chill and sleep to, it can wear thin a bit easily. I loved it at first, but after listening to it 50 times too many, the songs began to sound samey and boring. A great find, but don't spoil it."
4,"Very good, no matter who they sound like.","Why does it seem that every new band in the past few years is called the next U2/Radiohead/Coldplay? Anyway, regardless of the comparisons, Travis has a great album here in ""The Man Who"". You may be tempted to get ""Singles"" instead, which is also great, but this is their best album. Like many, I picked this up for the hit ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"", then found the rest was just as good. The opener ""Writing To Reach You"" is excellent as well, and I believe both ""Driftwood"" and ""Turn"" were singles also. All four of those songs make this worth the purchase, but I really enjoy ""The Fear"" and ""She's So Strange"" too. There's also a hidden track, which I think should stay hidden. This album is very consistent in mood, and the musicianship and singing are both tops. My only regret is not getting this sooner."
3,"Good fun, but unoriginal","I bought this CD on sale at the local record store, and started out enjoying it. The songs were all fairly catchy. Only problem is the songs are fairly simple. After listening to it for a few times, they start getting rather old. Add to this the fact that they reference Oasis and several other bands in their songs, and you start seeing that all their songs are rather formulaic. When I listened to ""Writing to Reach You"" another time, I noticed that in addition to mentioning Wonderwall (by Oasis), it also had almost the exact same chord progression in the same key. Good for a couple hours worth of listening."
3,it aint bad,"Good grief. Judging from previous comments, you'd think that we were talking about something serious: this is still pop music, right? Well, almost. The pace is pretty pedestrian (Scotland isnt that miserable is it?) but the songs are pretty,er, actually they are just that, pretty. Wether you want that in a band that is shifting serious numbers of units is another thing all together'Writing to Reach you' 'The Fear' and the inevitable 'Why does it always rain on me? (cause you live in scotland mate)'lead the way on here and nothing else really comes near. It reminds me of the stuff i listened to when i was 18 (though it doesnt actually sound like Suede's debut of 1993) and if you are 18 then that is probably a good thing- a soundtrack to while away the nights at university pondering why noone will......but i digress.Cheers"
3,"Good, but not exelent","I found Travis very cool as i listened to them the first time (an accoustic version of ""driftwood"". Then i bought the cd and i think the ""the man who"" isn't not so excellent as the british pappers write. When you hear it a few times it begings really to annoying. to say the true i hate Healy's voice. He's never as good as Tom Yorke from Radiohead. As someone here as written i found his voice very whiny. I think Travis copy from Radiohead as the Simple Minds did in the 80's to u2. But Travis will always be second. When you want to listen to good british bands listen first to The smiths, the cure, oasis, blur or u2. They are more interesting and not so reapeting as Travis. I think the hype will go soon and they"
4,Great Brit Pop,"A group you probably never heard of, but will in the coming months when they tour with Oasis this year. This follow-up to their homeland hit, Good Feeling, has exceeded expectations. After being called the Best Band in Britain this past year, they're ready to hit America.For those of you who don't know, these guys sound like Radiohead on Prozac. More pop and more uplifting lyrics overall. They range from the pop ballad to fast electric guitar riffed songs. If you love Brit pop, pick up this CD."
2,The soundtrack for Dawson's Creek,"OK....I am a big Radiohead fan, so when I heard the comparisons I picked this one up. THESE GUYS ARE NOT RADIOHEAD. Not even close. The only similarity is the singer's voices....and the fact that almost every track on The Man Who sounds like a softer variation of ""Paranoid Android"" or ""No Surprises"". Further, almost every track on here sounds like the one before it, the only one that stood out was ""Writing to Reach You."" This album caters to a teen audience...the whole thing can easily provide the soundtrack to Dawson's Creek. I can just see Dawson giving Joey that last meaningful look before breaking with her, while ""Slide Show"" plays softly in the background. C'mon. Radiohead? NO. And Oasis would kick these guys around and use them for wallpaper. This album is more like the Beatles Anthology CDs...lots of short sweet little tunes thought up by their creators in a matter of minutes."
2,Cry me a river...,"Don't get me wrong, this record has some good songs on it, at and times can be very enjoyable, but come on, how much contrived emotion can you cram into a album. ""writing to reach you"" is good and I like ""driftwood"" but songs like ""why does it always rain on me"" are just palthetic. The sound is stale and the lead singer is putting on such a fake, tortured ""whoa is me"" facade that it seems like he is going to burst into tears at every minute. And i can see some comparisons to radiohead, but if you think that the emotion present in this CD can match a good radiohead song like ""high and dry"" then you are sorely mistaken.."
5,One of the Best Albums around,"Brilliant album from our Scots lads, cannot fault it. It must be good as all my friends have bought it. Why does it always rain on me, Turn, Driftwood etc can't get these out of my head. If you do one good thing today, Buy It!"
4,Lightweight and overrated!,"There's not much to say about this album really. I like Travis very much. And although they do some great things on this album, I can't help placing them with so many lightweight alternative groups from the mid-90's. The first six tracks are good. ""Driftwood"" though is unbelievably cheesy. Travis needs to stick with what works for them. Like the first two songs, they are both great. But they tend to jump from mysterious-alt rock to cheesy pop and into a glacier-like flow. I think Travis is yet to find their niche within their own music genre. But, they are very good, just not settled in."
4,Better with each listening but...,"...not quite 5-star material in my opinion. This is a beautiful pop achievement in these days of fewer-and-farther-between catchy melodies. Previous reviewers are spot on in noting that Travis' style is somewhere between The Verve and Radiohead -- Fran Healy's vocals bear a close resemblance to Thom Yorke and, yes, David Gates of 70's popsters Bread. Despite a few tedious, if not uninspired moments, this album gets better with every listen ... at first listen I was ready to dismiss them as Radiohead knockoffs. Yet, unforgettable pop gems like ""Writing to Reach You"", ""Driftwood"", ""Turn"" and, of course, ""Why Does It Always Rain on Me?"" make this an album not to be missed. Here's hoping they continue to gain their due recognition and evolve a style of their own."
3,"Please learn some new chords, lads....","I waited a long time for this one to be released here as well, and though this album is great, I'm glad I didn't spend an extra fifteen bucks to get it before now.Since this album went over huge in Britain, I've been reading a lot about it in the music press, and the merits are deserved but at the same time, I was singing along with the new songs but with lyrics from the first album.The music can be beautiful even with Fran's voice as its own instrument (don't take all the lyrics at face value) but at times, I hear very little inspiration or real movement away from ""Good Feeling"", their first album. The hidden tracks caught more of my attention than other parts of the album, by the way.I hate to say it, but at this rate they'll be the early 21st century James (go dig out your copy of ""Laid"" if you wish and think about it) for their newfound American audience...."
2,looked good on paper...,"i bought this because it sounded like it would be great - however, on listening, i was amazed at how bland it sounded. everything about this record is just 'ok', as in C or C+. it's like belle and sebastian - without the irony. it's like the housemartins - with no edginess. it's like radiohead - without the depth.i think that travis are kind of a 'light' version of all their influences that might be perfect for for the 11-17 year old audience who are still impressed by cute blue-eyed men, or as a stepping stone away from boy groups and girl groups up to the next level of pop music.they have some talent in the song writing and playing department and they may actually produce some good music in the future. unfortunately, this just isn't it."
2,The man who thinks this album's overated,"How on earth is this still in the top 10 in Britain after a year of its release. I brought this after hearing why does it always rain on me which i quite liked but even that got boring after a while. The only good tracks i have to say are Turn, Slide Show and blue flashing light(the secret track). But other than that the albums not up to standerds. If the public could bands like Muse and Coldplay then the man who whould be nowhere. Frans whiney voice does not help either.Take my advice dont follow what the charts say. If you want some great indie bands then take Muses Showbiz, Embraces Drawn from memory and Coldplays parachutes but dont waste your money on an album with 3 good songs on it."
2,Not Bad...for a Radiohead Tribute,"What's all the blather about?Is it listenable? Sure. Catchy even? You betcha. Demonstrates nose for songcraft? Uhhuh. Swipes it all from Radiohead? Cha-ching!Greatest form of flattery, my foot. This thing is planet of the apes, all the way. Granted, they're not as clueless as Bush. But, ...masterpiece? Best record of the year? Come now! To your senses all.The lyrics are on the Jewel side of stupid; the melodies on the Squeeze side of novel.I just don't get it. But I'm sure you, the faithful, will flog me into submission in so many unhelpful votes cast. The high cost of dissent. Ooh, the sting. Thank you sir, may I have another."
3,beautiful but bland music,"Much better than there dissapointing follow-up, The Man Who is best described as beautiful. The songs: Driftwood, The Last laugh, Why does it always Rain on me and Slide Show are all very beautiful songs. they aren't very memorable but substain repeated listening well. In my opinion the best tracks are the hidden ones. Travis sounds best unpolished because it gains the edge the other songs are laking. The lyricks of the hidden tracks are also more direct and poignant."
2,Isn't That Cute!,"Clean, crisp bouncy pop tending toward the cutesy, fans of twee pop will probably enjoy it. I found it somewhat grating. Not recommended for hard rockers."
3,Not Radiohead,"I like this Cd. It's good, but not great. It doesn't sound like Radiohead, whom I like very much. This sounds something like the Beatles ""All Across The Universe"". It's very mellow with nothing shocking or disturbing to rattle your brain. Pretty safe, tame stuff for a Sunday drive."
5,One of the best,"Travis' second mainstream CD,Man Who, is probably their best overall CD. For those of you that know Travis, it is a mix between Good Feeling and The Invisible Band. If you listen to these CD's in the order they were recorded, you can see the evolution of Travis as a band and their style of music.It is a tremendous CD which will get better as you listen to it more. (This is especially true for their first CD, Good Feeling). So for you Travis fans, you'll love it. For those Travis fans-yet-to-be, give it a chance and you will soon love it as well. The style of music lies somewhere along the lines of old Radiohead, Remy Zero, and Oasis. The mostly depressing lyrics have a hint of Aimee Mann in them, but not as complex. Enjoy!!!"
5,Very engrossing,"Although it isn't overly spectacular, or exciting, or even original, it is still a very warm and charming album. I find it hard to take it out of my player. Perfect for late-night listening."
2,Sorry I purchased this,"I found this cd too quiet and introspective for my tastes right now. This is not to say this band has no talent or that others will feel as I do. Most of the other reviews here are glowing, so this cd just doesn't click with me."
2,"Not Bad, Not Great",having finally heard the whole album i have to admit i was a bit disappointed Travis merely sound like a James cover band that doesn't even have the originality to make songs sound different almost all songs on this cd sound the same. Each song on its own sounds ok but put them all together and it gts a bit boring. If you really have to spend your money I suggest you by a cd by James or dare I even say it Oasis.
3,Loses its appeal pretty fast,"I listened a few times (bought it on the hype) and it got progressively less interesting each time. It's pretty guitar-based Britpop a la Oasis (Godrich does it again) but lacks the experimentation and willingness to annoy that their peers have. Writing to Reach You will stand the test of time, although the rest sounds more and more like filler. Better to stick with The Bends or Mutations until something more interesting comes along."
5,Scotland rocks,"a powerfully addictive album that showcases the skills of a band that seems to combine some of the best qualities of Radiohead and Dave Matthews - while leaving out the bad behaviors and formulaic leanings of an Oasis.Scotland produced a fine band, indeed."
5,the album that rocks in melodies,"it is my best discovery last year. Although the album didn't sound very good at first, it is now not leaving my cd player. from the very first song to the extra track...amazing lyrics and layers of sounds. ""driftwood"" struck out of the album. The album consist of isolation, lonliness, and morning regret. it is a must have for brit pop fan and folk-melody fans. I am lookng forward to listen to Travis' new album, and i have great hope for it. Also, i started to listen to Travis's debut album, ""good feeling"". it gives so much raw energy and hyper good emotion songs. Travis is gonna be around for a long while. Buy this ALUBM"
5,"Very Nice Soft Pop, with a touch of Bread.","Travis is one of those bands that have come quietly on the scene, and are finally getting some well deserved exposure on MTV.Their current single ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"" is getting airplay as well as it should, the vocals, and instrumentals are of a 70s group Bread feel, with a Millenium twist.The rest of the album holds strong with songs like ""The Fear"", ""Slide Show"" and ""Luv"".This album is consistent and strong throughout. A definite buy for the soft rocker at heart.MY GRADE: A"
4,The Band Who.....,"made a great CD. Bursting through the wall of insufferable teen pop that has monopolized the airwaves is the glorious band Travis. Although a friend had sung their praise a few weeks ago it wasn't until I saw their startling video ""Why does it always rain on me"" on MTV (a rare moment of programming originality) that I was made an instant believer. No hype here, no Radiohead comparisons needed, just good music with a heart. Thats it!"
4,Excellent Album,"I just bought this album and it is excellent. The vocals and music are strong and the group shows a lot of promise. As good as it is, and I do understand the Radiohead comparisons, there is room for growth. While there are several great songs, there could be a little more variety in the sound. Some of the songs start to sound similar. And yes, I'm a huge Radiohead fan, and they have not reached that level yet. The mood to this album is much different than Radiohead, but it's clear that they borrow either directly or at least from the same influences of Radiohead. Mood aside, I don't think that they've dsplayed the layers and textures, or the same level of unparalleled musicianship of Radiohead. I do, however, think this is a great album and look forward to their continued development. They have the ability to write some really beautiful melodies."
5,Great Album,"Bought it because I liked "" Why does it allways rain on me"" and I liked the rest of the music."
5,Something to clear up in regards to Travis,"The Man Who (1999) was released before Invisible band (2000 or 2001, depends on english or american). Not the other way around. This said, this album was great. A complete turn around from Good Feeling. Songs like ""Writing"" and ""Luv"" are inspiring and melodious. The whole album is mellow with hints towards meloncholy yet it does not fail to uplight spirits and delight the ears of those who listen to it. A great buy and a friend for life."
4,Good cd!,"I like this cd. I had heard of the band through a magazine, and so I decided that from their review they HAD to be at least OK. They are great! Off the top of my head, I can't think of any band that sounds similar to Travis... though there has to be one out there somewhere--- 5 stars for being complete and utter gods at their music...minus one for almost getting me into a car accident (I was singing to ""turn"")"
3,Brilliant? erm....maybe,"Some of these songs are amazing! then others you have to wonder 'what went wrong here?'. I wont take apart every song on the album. but with songs like, 'why does it always rain on me?' or 'Turn' you realize that the lyrics are complete garbage. The album is unique though and worth owning. I myself have no idea why they are compared to radiohead they sound nothing like each other at all. Bottom line- if you like bands like The Verve and Oasis you will probably like this Album, if you like your angst ridden rock i dont think this has much to offer (not that theres anything wrong with that mind you).ps- The last hidden tracks are probably the best songs on the album."
4,Right On!,"I can't believe how this band keeps getting better and better. I love their sound, clean crisp guitars, and mournful vocals. Well, sometimes mournful, sometimes cheery, but always right on. My favorite album of the year."
2,was interesting when it came out...,"but now it's just kinda lame. Their sound (to me) gets old and becomes a little too weak fro my tastes. Not as complicated as some of the other bands that are putting out stuff nowadays. I put them in the same catagory as Semisonic. Just OK. Better than cookie cutter bands, but not really up to par to be included in a collection of good music."
2,Campfire Music,"As a singles band I would rate Travis however as an album band they are boring whinning Scots and should be left to the Scottish Highlands. Every song pretty much sounds the same, an annoying singer, a couple of acoustic guitars, percussion and the odd other instrument. The music is downtempo and uninteresting, not much originality either. I recon you would get the same effect sitting around a campfire with an acoustic guitar, and then you would probably sing to better songs. The music is too imposing and depressingly bad to sleep to and too boring to play around company, so what do you do with it? Throw this album in the fire, at least it might impress those around you."
2,Been awhile since the last Radiohead album hasn't it?,"I think the reason why the album is getting such great reviews is that people are simply craving for a new Radiohead album. What you have here with this Travis album is a step down and the next best thing available. Deny it all you like but Travis are nothing more than Radiohead clones. Don't get me wrong the songs are decent, but by no means original. If you are dying to have something to tide you over until the next Radiohead album then this is the album for you. For the rest of us out there, save your cash for the real Radiohead. ON a positive note though, Travis are a band that's talented enough to keep an eye on. Hopefully their next effort will see them attempt to write their own, original songs."
1,THE MAN WHO...(finds travis to be overrated),"It's hard to figure out why Travis are such a hyped up band. The first song I heard was their cover of ""hit me baby one more time"", which I found pretty good actually, and bit comical as well. Unfortunately, their own material soon started whistling past my ears on the radio. Songs like ""Turn"" and the exceptionally bad, britpop-ish and slow ""why does it always rain on me"". About a week ago I heard their album, and I do believe I tried listening to it without my recent britpop prejudice (can anyone blame me?). But what I heard, was probably one of the most overrated recordings in years. Travis are basically as unoriginal as it can get, plus they sound phenomenally alike all a the other hyped up british bands around these days (for example the band with the parachutes album). I think this is quite a shame really, because if Travis had a little ""soul"", their music could easily work. But this is simply mediocre pop music at its worst. To be avoided!"
3,GOOD stuff,"good stuff from these boys...thouroughly enjoyable, but not ground-breaking nor mind-smashing in my point of view. best track is ""Driftwood."" ""Why Does it Always Rain on Me"" is also a great tune. i was pleasantly surprised by these guys, they've gotten so much press i thought it was a fluke. a really nice record, i like it on a sunday afternoon."
4,"Put it on, no put on!","Travis's ""The Man Who"" is the perfect listen when you need something different. Whatever you like to listen to the most, sometimes you get tired of it and need a little change; that's where Travis's latest release comes in.I've found it to go best with my study time, when I'm hitting the books. It's a nice mix between fast and up-beat and slow and mellow. That's what I look for in a study album. But, hey, it's not just for study time. That's just me.At times it reminds me of Radiohead, at other times it seems like a scene from ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,"" at others, it's something all together different.It's good. Go for it."
4,On Travis - The Man Who,"Melodic angst. And yes, it is reminiscent of Radiohead. The highlight is the faster-paced, ""Why does it always rain on me?"" (#7). Ironically, the clouds somehow seem to break on that song, pace-wise. It speeds things up a bit.Overall, clever lyrics, radiating sadness and Britishness. Perhaps a melancholic brightness? One to listen to when it's raining, although that might be too much grey! Glad I own it, though, if that helps. It's pretty in a distant sort of way. And not *quite* as hopeless as Radiohead."
3,this is actually 3-1/2 stars...,"After seeing them and the video for ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"" on MTV's 120 Minutes, I decided to take a chance on them. After hearing ""The Man Who"" only twice, they remind of a band you can see perform while sitting in a coffeehouse or cafe. They're a bit mellow for my tastes, but somehow, I have the feeling that I'm going to listen to this CD a bit more often. The best tracks are ""Turn"" and ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"". Recommended if you're into Beatlesque music, Oasis, Radiohead, and The Verve."
2,Ecco Mary Jane,These shoes looked really nice and cute. They did not fit my foot...but I am a difficult person to fit.
3,Great Price Eureka Vaccum,"HEPA filtration is great. Ergonomics are fine, suction adaquate. A good buy."
1,disappointing,I have to push stop/start & clear a number of times before I can start the timer. It never just shuts off. It's always counting or on a clock that I don't need. I was looking for simple & this wasn't it.
1,junk,"as someone else mentioned, this is a surprise coming from Oxo/Softworks. A surprise because it is awful. Buttons do not register presses properly. It is annoying to use. You really do not need to know more. There are many other timers on the market. avoid this one!"
1,Back to the drawing board...,"Seriously, don't try this timer. I didn't believe the reviews until I tried it.It's worse than you'd think it'd be, especially for the OXO/Softworks brand. The screen is like a recessed! slit; hard to see; bad angle; and on top of that tiny. The buttons are very hard to press. You will try to press 'stop' and it won't work; then you press down really hard and it accepts it after 4 tries. Goofy controls and it is not user intuitive. Feels slightly cheap too, especially the clock/timer button. Just annoying. Mine got returned, thankfully. Believe me try something else! Or at least, keep the packaging and receipt, you'll return it."
1,junk,"don't buy this timer.- it's annoying to press the buttons; they're fairly stiff, and you have to push them down all the way for it to register- the clock is not accurate at all... after only a week or so, the minutes will be significantly off- the display is rather small- when using the timer, the screen automatically flips back to displaying the clock when left idle for a little while."
3,Bringing in a Brown New Year,"Charles Brown is known for two classic Christmas hits, ""Merry Christmas Baby"" and ""Please Come Home For Christmas"". Both of those songs appear here, on this reissue of his first Christmas album, although these are rerecordings and not the original hit versions. Those are the best songs on this album, which is a pretty uneven album. To be sure, there are some other fine songs, like ""Wrap Yourself in a Christmas Package"" and ""Christmas Questions"", but some of the songs are rather forgetable. But the real problem with this CD is the sound quality. Whoever remastered it did a terrible job. It is labeled as being in stereo, but it is actually in very poor mono. The worst sounding song is ""Merry Christmas Baby"", which is very scratchy sounding, like an old 45 that has been played too many times. I wouldn't recommend this CD, buy one of Charles Brown's other Christmas CDs. I haven't heard them, but they have to sound better than this."
4,Delightful!,"1876 Sacramento, California and Prosperity, ColoradoRough and gruff mine owner, Ross McCain wanted the children of Prosperity to have something he didn't have despite his success of operating flourishing mines. That was knowing how to read and to have an education. Lonely and desperate Jessica Tierney wanted the freedom to choose her own lifestyle and the frantic Jessica didn't deter the misunderstanding that lead Ross to believe she was Prosperity's newly obtained school teacher. Ross didn't want Jessica to know his secret of being illiterate as well as lonely, so can these two mismatched individuals possibly provide what the other needs?An enjoyable quick and easy read."
4,Wonderfully whimsical,I found this story moving and entertaining. The story was a bit drawn out and tedious at times. Overall I enjoyed the story and thought it illustrated the depression. It made you think of how much we take for granted in our world. Also how would we handle their circumstances if we had to face their challenges. We live in a society that has so much and they live so well with so little. I feel this story woudl make a wonderful movie.
5,Fallen Angels,THIS WAS A TRULY HEART WARMING BOOK...I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND OUT THERE ARE A SERIES OF THEM..5 STARS
1,Fallen Angels is a dissapointment,"I read Fallen Angels because I needed to for school summer reading. I was bored by the book's predictable storyline, and disapointed by the inconclusive ending. I endured through the book's smarmy lines only to find out I had read the wrong book. I would not recomend this book to anyone, and I hope every coply is destroyed in a nuclear explosion."
2,Mixed emotions,Mixed emotions about this book. It took me like 1hr to get through itand I actually skipped parts of it because it didnt apply to mydaughter. I dont feel like I learned a lot from reading the bookand I wouldnt tell my friends to go out and buy it.
3,How do you feel about trolls?,"If you hate trolls, you will hate this. If you love them, well, you still might find this annoying. But my kids (3 and 6) love it. The Trollies sing lots of 50s rock hits in their high squeeky Troll voices. The horror! The horror!"
5,Good even though Used,"I loved this video as a kid, and bought it for my neice. Another viewer pleased. It arrived on time and in good shape. It was bought as a used thing, but it still is in great shape."
4,GREAT Starting point!!,"This book is a fantastic starting point for parents getting ready to transition a kid on the spectrum from elementary to middle school. Lots of evaluation tools and guidance on who, how and when to use them. Lots of ""backbone to borrow"" when working with teachers, administrators and therapists to get a strong, individualized program designed and set up. Help with timelines, objections and obstacles, resource ideas, and setting priorities. The case study and personal history sections were very comforting (I really am not alone in this struggle) and informative (just what is important to a 12yo boy on the spectrum about school).Highly recommended - but start early!"
1,Terrible,"I've seen a lot of anime, and this is by far the worst animation and story I've ever seen. If you want the same thing with good elements, watch Ninja Scroll. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Lacking.,This was really a bad movie. It really lacks plot. In fact it doesn't make any sense at all. I'm glad I only rented it.
1,Wraith of the Viewer!,"Wraith of the Ninja has only one good quality going for it, it makes us appriciate Ninja Scroll even more. The characters in this over rought film are litteraly and metaphorically two dimesional. The animation is o.k., I can say that I have definitly seen worse animation. The voices are down right annoying. The story is absolutly rediculous. Take my advise pass on this one and get ""Ninja Scroll"" instead. If already own ""Ninja Scroll"" then try ""Street Fighter II:THE ANIMATED MOVIE"". WARNING THIS FILM CONTAINS SCENES OF STRONG VIOLENCE. Sugested viewing age is 15 and up. Yet nobody under seven would even find this waste of animated cells entertaining."
1,Absolutely Horrendus,"I must admit...I was duped. It's a popular anime title, and the animation on the box peaked my curiosity. Once I popped it in to watch, I was deeply dissapointed. Here's a list of why:The animation is awfulThe plot is confusingIt's terribly boringOverall, it's really ""cheesey"" - they fight monsters out of the blue for no apparent reason, the monsters just show up. I think this is a disgrace to japanese animation. Want a reccomendation? Go with Akira or Ghost in the Shell."
2,There are better,"Some of the lowest calibur anime you can find. If your looking for a decent ninja anime movie, try Ninja Scroll. There is much better anime out there."
3,Unimpressive,"The dialoge was lame and the music was annoying. The movie jumps into the story without explaining much, then various characters will spew out info for the viewers, but it makes no sense as the heroes should already know these details, so there is no real reason for them to be mentioned.( EXAMPLE: Some old guy tells 2 people about the Shadow Ninja clans, but they ARE the Shadow Ninjas, so wouldn't they know their own history?) There was also an overabundance of dramatic, minor character death scenes. The plot is the standard ""demon-possessed warlord must be defeated by heroes with magic weapons otherwise the gate to Hell will open"". It picks up at the very end when the last bad guy reveals his intentions, but is otherwise pretty standard. This is a mediocre ninja movie. Pick up Ninja Scroll instead."
1,One word: Pathetic,"I'm sorry I even SAW the movie! The plot was horribly cheesy and the dialouge sounded like it came out of a low budget horror film. When I bought this, I thought it might be as good as other ninja animes, such as Ninja Scroll, but I was terribly mistaken. For anyone that knows a good movie if the saw one, please, don't buy this movie. You'd be better off keeping your money."
1,This movie blows wang,one of teh worst anime movies i have ever seen. the story is boring and pointless and teh actoin sceens arent intense. if you want good anime see Akira or ninja scroll. Iria is good too.
1,Don't waste your time,"Horrible! Confusing storyline, bad music and weak character development all combine to make this one of the worst anime movies I've seen thus far."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This may not be the worst anime i have ever seen but it sure comes close. A covuluted and unbelievable plot, another weak female character and a lousy ending combine to get this film a 1 star rating! Stick with Ninja Scroll."
5,HACK HACK HACK HACK!!!!,This movie is great if you're into tons of hackenslash madness (which coincidentally I am). The fighting kind of reminded me of a really bloody crouching tiger hidden dragon. Tons of back flips in the air and hacking arrows with swords and all that unimaginabley cool stuff. The animation is really really good considering that it was made in 1989 but compared to ninja scroll and Princess monononke it's kind of dated.(It is better than MD Geist) The dubbing is good and the weapons they have are unique and sweet.Overall you should definitely buy this DVD.
3,Um....er...ah.....,"Okay, I understand that this movie is actually the Yoteden OAV series all thrown together (with 40 some minutes taken out). But I wish they did keep those 40 minutes in. First of all, the plot is so complicated that I don't even have it figured out yet. The music is horrible and the dubbing not much better but still not the worst anime I have ever seen."
5,great anime!!!,"If you like ninja scroll, you'll love this movie. A good story line and great fighting scenes to match. The story line is in depth, so it doesn't bore you after 30 min. Pretty bloody but hey that's japanimation for ya!"
1,>shakes head in dissappointment<,"I was told this was the sequel to Ninja Scroll, IT IS NOT! What it is, in fact, is the single worst anime I have ever seen. Poor animation, lame plot, weak characters and voice acting almost as bad as ""Battle Angel."" It is absolutely unbearable. NOT RECCOMENDED!"
2,Had potential at first,"At the start of this movie, it seemed rather interesting. But the the movie rambled on from subject to subject, time period to time period, and the plot twist toward the end was so inaudible, that only a computer could understand it completely. I never know the intentions of any of the three shadow warriors, and it is impossible to keep track of the seven obero ninjas (unlike the 8 devils of Kimon in ""Ninja Scroll"") and the love between Sakon and Ayama was not very beleivable. This movie needed a better introduction, and more time to straigten out the plot. 189 minutes would be more suitable than a meager 89 minutes. Throw in irritating cheesy fight music, fights in which you don't know who is who, and plot twists involving characters who were never really in the movie that much in the first place, and you have one dissapointing movie that could have ranked among great Ninja movies like ""Ninja Scroll,"" or ""The Dagger of Kamui."""
3,very average,"Some scenes were good, but overall it's not worth buying. There are much better works of anime out there and this should not be at the top of your list. It gets way too slow at times (unlike good anime) and it's the kind of movie you won't really want to see again.So take my advice, if you must see it, rent it."
2,Too sad,"This anime is by far one of the worse I have ever seen. It has no plot other than the good guys beat up the bad guys. The characters were very poory done. The scenery is the only good part of this movie. If you want a good ninja anime, get Ninja Scroll. Bury this one."
2,Watch the Original,I have to agree with bishamon01 that the movie version isn't nearly as good as the original 3-part story. If you liked the movie version or want to watch the story as it was meant to be then watch the original 3-part version which I think is titled Yotoden: Chronical of the Warlord Period
3,Great target card,"The card is great, makes hanging ceiling grid easier. The metallic strip fell of and I had to reattach. Also found it cheaper at wall tools."
3,Watchable TV movie,"In between her acclaimed turns in ""Murder in Texas"" and ""The Burning Bed"", Fawcett made this watchable TV movie playing a high class hooker in a brothel who becomes involved in a sting operation with detective 'Beau Bridges' to catch an extortionist played by Harold Gould. Fawcett is of course excellent and has one or two 'standout' scenes, she is entirely credible in her role - my problem like other reviewers was in the casting of Beau Bridges who just seemed 'wishy washy'. If you're looking to pass the time you could do far worse."
5,My Printer is FREE!,"Free from cables my Printer is. Setting this up was a little trickey/different than what I expected, but was easily figured out when I followed the instructions. The setup was over in about 10 minutes and I was able to print the first time we tried. Setting up new computers was also laid out step-by-step by the instructions so you don't do anything wrong.Very straight forward and well documented. Thanks to D-Link."
5,just ignore the instructions,"If you ignore the instructions for seting up the print server, setup is a snap. just turn off your printer, hook up the device in normal mode, power the device, power the printer. then follow the quick setup guide for your individual computer settings and it works in 10 min. flat."
1,This thing just won't work.,"Spent 2 sessions with tech support with two different printers from differnet manufacturers, Brother and Samsung. Could not get it to work. An hour wait for tech support each time.Have about 6 to 7 hours trying to make this work. Could have printed about 5,000 pages in same time.Instruction manual is incorrect and all settings have to be entered manually.Tech support told me to return it as defective.I'll try another manufacturer."
1,Difficult setup for D-Link DP-311P,"I am an experienced pc / wireless user, and I returned this product because I was unable to set it up. The installation manual was complicated / unclear, as well.Linksys Wireless-G user."
3,Incompatible with Compaq iPAQ Connection Point CP-2W,"I have a Brother HL-5150D laser printer and our household network is driven by a Compaq iPAQ Connection Point CP-2W router. Although the D-link DP-311P could detect our network, it was unable to receive a DHCP single. We could get the printer recognized on the network by 1) using the wrong network channel and 2) a static IP address. This allowed the printer to function perfectly for a limited period of time. Somewhere between 30 minutes and 2 hours, the printer would ""fall off"" the network and was no longer recognized by our computers. For our computers to re-recognize the printer, the Compaq router had to be turned off and then on.I recommend only using wireless hardware that all come from the same manufacture to avoid these conflicts."
4,A life lived for others,"At first I was wondering when they would share more about His faith & his church, but the more I watched, the more I realized it was his character that spoke loudly to others. I liked how honest it was; that he wasn't perfect, & owned up to his mistakes (the story of a fight in school ect.) The ending with his father was a great way to reach others for Christ. Maybe good for older youth group in church. Also, video techniques kept your interest, too. A blessing to watch."
3,Must have,"I like the assortment. Price was pretty good too.The whole family actually likes it, including the dogMerry Christmas to all who review"
2,Emergency Use - But Not For Long-Term,"I have to say that I thought these were the lowest-quality imaginable for each of the three items per pack - the cheese was greasy all over the outside, and otherwise nondescript rubbery strips; the ""meat sticks"" were leathery and dry and sort of sandy; and the pretzel sticks were likewise blaa.I ordered the pack of 12 to keep in my office desk for snacks. Because they were so unappealing, I didn't really burn through them and, after a few months, they really started to look even worse, and that was with keeping them stored in a very stable, dark environment (desk drawer in a climate controlled area).So, I think you could do better to buy better quality versions of these items; but if you really want the convenience of having them packed together like this, and can get around the low quality, they are probably okay for you if you don't try to keep them too long or in a hot car etc."
1,"Was suppose to have 12 in package, but only had 11.","I sent this as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, the box it was shipped in was not damaged, but the package the snacks were in only had 11 instead of the 12 it said it should have. It looked as though someone had very carefully removed one of them."
5,Good Stuff,I ordered these and got them on time and the jack link's/cheese/pretzel's were very good and i liked them alot. Would order again. and ive told friends to buy them if there looking for a good deal.
3,I prefer the Short shots.,"Jack Link's Jack Pack!, 2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)I bought these before I had triedBuffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short ShotsI prefer the Short shots.I realize that this is a matter of personal taste. The Jack Links are okay (3 stars) the short shots are 5 stars, in my opinion. The prices are compatible for the quantity.Gunner February, 2010"
1,Very Disappointing!,"After changing kitchen decor, I was hoping to find my favorite kettle in yellow/citrus. It wasn't available so I shopped around for a temporary replacement. This looked a little small for us but it also looked simple and safe enough for the family to use, so I purchased it, hoping it would temporarily suffice. Even with low expectations, this kettle was awful! It is not what I would consider yellow but so pale as to be more of a cream color, with a slight yellow tinge. It chipped within a week of CAREFUL use. There is no way to pour without DRIPPING and spilling much of the water that comes out! I had thrown away the packaging and couldn't return it, so I tossed it out. I will happily settle for any color, just to get my favorite kettle back. That one lasted for years and still works great! Based upon this purchase, I would be hesitant to buy another Oxo product."
3,Adventure Marred by Outdated Views of Adoption,"I enjoyed reading this book to my 10 year-old son until I read ahead to the ending. I was shocked to see how the author, Craighead George, presented adoption. My son and daughter are both adopted in open adoptions, but reading about adoption in Tree Castle Island is like going back to the 1960s. Adoption is presented as a shameful secret. There is a lot of emphasis on how the adopted kids look nothing like the adoptive parents, how they only share real and important things with their ""real"" siblings and ""real"" parents--not the adoptive parents. Frankly, I won't be finishing this book with my kid because it's almost harmful in the way it addresses adoption. If you have adopted kids, you may want to skip this book."
4,Itching to camp in the Okefenokee?,"My 9 year old son really enjoyed this book, accepting the amazing series of coincidences uncritically, but he was amazed that Jack woke up the morning after making his bed out of Spanish moss with nary a bite from the redbugs that usually infest the stuff. The Indians and settlers used to bake the moss before they used it. We visit the Okefenokee often, and this book's descriptions of the shadowed cypress bogs and sun-hammered prairies adds another layer of appreciation, but watch the facts: talk to folks who live around the swamp when you visit!"
4,The Tree Castle Island Adventure,"This book is about a boy named Jake who venture into the Okefenoke Swamp and learns the secret of his childhood . The adventure has mysterious sounds , scary secrets , and a happy ending . This book is recomended for everyone ."
3,Tree Castle Island book review,"I gave this book 3 stars because it is about how someone can survive on an island without tools. This book is about Jack, who sets out in his homemade canoe for the Okefenokee Swamp. When he lands on an island he finds... read the book to find out what happens."
3,Three stars,"I would give this book three stars because this book is a good book but some parts are too unreal. The ending was okay. I didn't really like the ending because some parts I didn't want to happen, they really surprised me. I didn't like the ending as much as the beginning. It was very confusing. There aren't even really sad parts at all and I like books that have feelings and emotions and are realistic.The parts that I liked were when the characters meet and their adventures in the Okefenokee Swamp. This is a really cool book. They should make a sequel or a movie or something to see what happens. So good job Jean Craighead George, you have made a very interesting book."
4,EASY NIGHTIME READING,"EVEN THOUGH THIS STORY WAS ""LIGHT"" READING, I ALWAYS FIND ELLIOT ROOSEVELT'S WRITING ENTERTAINING WITH ENOUGH INTRIGUE TO MAKE THE BEDTIME RITUAL OF READING PLEASANT. THE TOUCHES OF HISTORY MAKE IT ALL THE MORE FUN."
3,Difficult plot!,"Purchase this book for a relative who is in a nursing home and because she loved all the other Elliot Roosevelt books I sent I thought she would be as thrilled with this book. She said she did not like it, said it was hard to follow."
4,a good read,"Actually, was not sure what to expect when I began reading this book. Had read some of them by Margaret Truman, but not Elliott. It was surprisingly very good and I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,"Waste of money, do not buy!!","Do not bother in buying this product it is not easy to use nor to understand or hear what it is saying. I also have tried to return it, but the company that sent has returned any of my emails, Amazo has been of no help either."
2,RETURN,"TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND TO USED ,NOT LIGHT AT THE SCREEN A MESS MY HUSBAND IS FROM BRAZIL HE COULDNT UNDERSTAND HOW TO USED.DONT SIMILAR THAT WHAT THEY SAY AT AMAZON STORE."
2,Not really useful,"Tthe quality outside is ok, but the translation is only in one direction. Englisch into Portugues. This does not make sense at all and is on travel useless."
1,Maxtor drives are only temporary,"I've purchased 2 of the 1TB Maxtor OneTouch III Turbo Edition Hard Drives .... both just quit working after a couple months .... I was very fortunate to have backed up the backup in both situations, but I will NEVER get another Maxtor. I've replaced with LaCie and so far so good."
1,Worst Hard Drive. Ever.,"I've had two of these.See, I had one, and thought ""surely no national brand would be this utterly awful"" so when it failed (and it will fail, I assure you) I thought it was a fluke.Still, I wanted to be safe so I didn't get another one for the office backups. I did, however, get one for the home backups.Failed the exact same way. Apparently the drive itself will work, (or ""work,"" as they call it at Maxtor) but the power supply / drive enclosure will fail. It will nto give any indication it has failed, it will simply never couple to your PC, server, whatever. The light on the front, however, that'll stay lit. No problem there.Seriously, these things are like a pox on utility. I have other brand drives which work and have continued to work in the space of time these pieces of junk have gone from new to fail. They're just awful.Stay away. I beg you."
1,just don't buy Maxtor,"Just don't do it. There are too many other brands to choose from. Avoid Maxor. It is that simple. We had TWO fail within the same time period. These drives simple suck. All the others who wrote similar remarks are perfectly correct. Anyone posting a postive review either has not used the drive enough for it to fail, or they just got lucky. Don't buy a Maxor!"
1,Seagate not willing to replace these anymore,"I've had 2 of these fail within the last week. Seagate is replacing my failed drives with a Seagate 2TB xTreme. When I bring up the fact that the feature sets are not the same since I use the OneTouch in mirrored mode, they say that the OneTouch 3 is no longer being manufactured. Also, you have to pay if you want advanced replacement which makes no sense. Unless I have a spare drive available, I don't have the opportunity to salvage my existing data before sending it back?I'll stick to Western Digital from now on."
4,Maxtor External Drive Review,"This product is just what I needed - large disk, capable of RAID 1 configuration and FireWire enabled. And for the price (which is continually falling), it suits the need. Just to think that 20 years ago 1.5 TB cost hundreds of thousands of dollars!"
1,Failed to format to NTFS - hangs at 73% for days,"I'm a tech teacher and own 4x500 WD MyBooks, a 400Gb Seagate, 2 300Gb Maxtors and a few generic 250Gb drives. This Maxtor 1.5 TB OneTouch III Turbo Edition looks like bad news - it failed to format to NTFS, hanging at at ~ 73% for about a day. I tried a second time, and could see no indication that this drive will ever format completely. I just don't have the time to spend days waiting around for drives to format - they should do so right out of the box, or Maxtor should supply them pre-formatted for either Mac and PC. Rating: Not ready for prime time - ""One Touch"" won't do it!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I used to own this drive. Note very carefully how I say ""used to"". This is because the drive failed catastrophically. One might even go as far as to say ""EPIC FAIL"" if one were so inclined.While transferring files from the external to a new internal drive, the drive itself started to make a clicking sound. The transfer was interrupted,the drive itself disappeared from My Computer and the transferred data was corrupted beyond recovery.The drive itself was dead, and it was trying to take over seven years of my career as a professional artist with it.It was *physically* damaged, which necessitated sending it to a Class 100 clean room. Due to it being a pair of 750gb drives in a striped RAID-0 array, the recovery was even MORE expensive than a standard forensic data rescue. It has cost me just under $4000 to save my data and my career.I will NEVER buy Maxtor products again. EVER."
1,Maxtor/Seagate External Hard Drives,"Failed after less than a month, lost all my data & their response was ""that I should have backed up my backup as electronics fail"". I'll never buy another one of their products again & I doubt I'll ever shop Amazon again, with only a 30 day return policy!"
1,Bagless? Hardly!,"Where did they get the idea this vacuum was bagless?! It's NOT.Other than that tho, it seems OK."
1,Sounded great for SIX weeks,"Bought this unit and it sounded great in my son's room but while playing a CD it quit 6 weeks after the purchase. Now no CD will play and only the tuner will work. Tried unplugging it to reset it (as if it were Microsoft) and blowing out any dust, but still no dice.The 30 day warranty won't help me now. Looks like other RCAs have similar problems."
3,Nice cooking tips,I liked the old recipes but the trivial travels etc. of the ladies was too contrived. They are so much better when they are cooking and just talking to each other. I would not buy anymiore of this series.
5,sirius antenna,I needed a replacement for my radio and everyone else wanted a lot for it but Amazon had this one at a good price. Well made.
5,excellent,I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT I WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM AMAZON PLEASE INFORM ME WITH OTHER PRODUCTS.
2,Watch doors and windows,"I used this antenna with a boombox. It worked fine until a sliding patio door cut the wire in half. My problem here is the sliding door was not slammed shut or mishandled. The wire seemed awfully fragile to break the way it did. If you will be putting the antenna outside, make sure the wire will not be pinched by a door or window."
1,No signal at all,"I'm a veteran Sirius customer and can honestly say this item is worthless for the most part, especially if you live in Area 5 (see Sirius' webpage on positioning and installaion). Never has worked in the 2 years I've owned it, regardless if it was inside or out- sat it 75 feet away from any building with a clear sky above and still never worked. This just doesn't have a strong enough signal to pick up anything especially in area 5.However I did find something interesting- the magnetic small car antenna works better than anything even for a home docking kit which I use it on. It will pick up a perfect signal even beside a building and obstructions above- save yourself some $$$$ and just use the antenna for the car at your home too!"
3,"You'll need the perfect , undisturbed spot for this antenna","I was unable to get a consistent, satisfactory signal with this unit.I found that unless you had perfect alignment to the satellite, this antenna did not receive the signal consistently well. Also, the least movement of the connecting cord or if someone moved the blind/curtain, this would often be enough to move the antenna and thus disturb the exact positioning required to make this antenna function properly.In the end I returned this unit and got an extra car antenna (the one with the strong magnet); this allowed me to put an extension cord under the window sill to the outside. I then was able to easily find a site that gave me excellent, continuous satellite reception using the magnetic antenna (exact positioning is not nearly as demanding for the magnetic antenna). Since then my home unit has worked perfectly."
1,"Cromwell, A Historical Novel","This was awful from page one. The author irritatingly tries to re-create the quaint English spoken in Cromwell's time, but it doesn't sound authentic. I didn't finish it."
3,2 of the best songs from original LP cut off! Bummer!,"I loved this album when I had it way back when, but the CD has eliminated 2 of the best songs on it to ""fit"". Bummer! I downloaded them separately, but it's still not the same. Otherwise, a great Joni live experience."
5,Highlight of Mitchell's career,"I saw this tour live and when I saw Joni come out with some of the best musicians in the world backing her up I about fell out of my chair. Mitchell, Pastorius, Metheny, Brecker, Mays, et al, did not disappoint.The performances of many of Joni's best songs are superior to the studio versions with unmatched life and vibrancy and Mitchell is in amazing voice.While some may prefer Joni's folk/pop career, for me her jazz-influenced work is by far her most imaginative and compelling. Joni and perhaps Sting are unmatched in their ability to fuse pop/rock/folk/jazz.Reaching back to ""Court & Spark"" and concentrating on her two masterpieces ""Hissing..."" and ""Hejira"" and with the best from ""Mingus"" there is little here that doesn't rate five stars."
5,Joni's Jazz,"I've always loved this CD. Joni is at a plateau in her career here, having moved from folky singer/songwriter to Jazz influenced singer. She probably started slipping a bit after this. Her voice here is perfect, and her phrasing is as always truly unique.Favourite track for me is ""In France they Kiss on Main Street"". Pat Methany plays wonderful guitar and the band are really powerful. However 'Coyote' 'Hejira' and 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' are all great in there own ways.The band is phenomenal, Michael Brecker is on Sax, Jaco Pastorius Bass, together with Lyle Mays on Keyboards and Don Alias on drums. This is a one-off Jazz super-group that only ever worked together for this tour, and never recorded in the studio as a unit.If you like Joni Mitchell's Jazz side this is an essential purchase and you can buy the DVD of this as well, which is well worth getting."
2,Cracked CD covrer,"The music is great. The CD was packaged in a bubble wrap emvolope. This protects from impact but not twisting or compresseve loads. The plastic CD case was almost broaken in half. The CD is fine, but when the jewl case falls appart the CD will get damaged. I will get a replacement for the case, but the replacements are not the same, and you usualy loose the art that inserts into the case."
2,Deeply disappointing,"I've been a fan of Joni Mitchell since the early seventies, but this is a concert performance free from any evidence of joy, unstudied spontaneity or audience interaction. A self-gratifying performance from Miss Mitchell, massively inferior to her Miles of Aisles concert album. Adding insult to injury, the quality of the recording on this CD is inferior: Muddy and indistinct. For compulsive collectors only."
1,Why?,"I hate to say negative things about Joni, but man-this album is far from decent. I'm not the type who gets freaked out about ""change"", but I truly wish she would have just kept Max Bennett and John Guerin (even if they did divorce). No offense to Jaco, but his ""fretless"" sound can get out of control. Especially on sweet tracks like ""In france"" and ""edith and the kingpin"". It really doesn't fit. The whole sound just kinda makes me sick. If you want a good live Joni album, get ""Miles of Ailes""."
2,Good Information but No Color,"Among the art books I own, this is the least used and that's a sad fact. I generally read art books from cover to cover when I first get them and this one was no exception. The information given about early modernist art is in-depth, complete and, I feel, required reading for any artist. However, when I go back to one as reference and realize the entire book has only 8 color plates in over 300 pages, I generally drop it in search of another which shows the art as it was meant to be seen. I fully understand that this is probably a college textbook and costs may have been a concern, but modernists works were not only unique for their use of shape, line and composition, they were also considered groundbreaking for their use of color. To show so little of it is a misstep in an otherwise decent book."
5,"The Right Foundation, The Right Answers",Too few certification books today provide the firm foundation that you need to be successful. They seem to focus on the questions you'll be asked. Although this book did provide direct feedback on what to expect out of the exam it also developed a firm foundation for what you need to know -- whether you take the exam or not.
5,Best study guide of my 15 study guides,"In the past year of purchased and read 15 study guides. I rate this one the highest for organization, clarity, relevance, and usefulness as a reference. The practice questions in the book were ecelent and gave good explnations. It would have been nice if the additional practice questions were included in the CDROM instead of having to register online. The tutorial on line was very general and rather boring, but good for those times when you don't want to read."
1,Please...Don't waste your time or money....,"I rented this movie a few days ago, and it was awful.Horrible acting, ultra low-budget, with a plot that made no sense.I fell asleep, it was so boring.Save your money and your time."
2,Wasted potential.,"<strong>Plasterhead</strong> (Kevin Higgins, 2006)Utterly generic slasher flick notable only for the appearance of scream queen Raine Brown (<em>Horror</em>). That it is generic, not to mention intensely stupid, is not why I hated it quite as much as I did, however. That is because the movie could have, with another revision or two to the script, had some very interesting things to say about race and vengeance (think <em>Candyman</em> here, naturally), but that part came off as nothing more than a confused muddle at best, a plot device at worst. Depending on which of the two interpretations you go with, the movie is either incompetent in the former case or offensively racist in the latter. I chose to at least give the screenwriter the benefit of the doubt. *"
2,Plasterhead,"This movie had a good story but the movie kept going on with nothing really happening. Plasterhead would appear but really do nothing important. He was probably the dumbest horror villian i've ever seen. The few death scenes are decent but nothing that made me stand up and say cool. The last half hour really gets dark and you can barely see the movie.Overall, didnt have bad acting and there is a story. However, it goes nowhere and I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is looking for gore and killings."
3,Really good premise....if only they had a bigger budget,"I have to say that I really enjoyed the premise behind ""Plasterhead"". Despite the goofy name, the film packs a decent little slasher punch. ""Plasterhead"" himself is a pretty impressive monster/killer. The guy is HUGE and menacing! The supporting cast are made up of your usual horror film cliches, but not so annoying as to ruin the film. (Luckily, the most annoying character in one of the first people to buy it!) The make up effects when used are very good, and the lonely wooded landscape and small town are a perfect setting for a horror film.I just wish the film makers had a larger budget for special effects. The lack of on-screen kills really hindered my enjoyment of the film. I want to see some slashing in my slasher flicks, and unfortunately most of the kills happen off-screen. Still, this isn't a bad flick, and with a larger budget they could have started a nice new horror franchise."
2,Should have had help,This book is not very well written. The author should have had the help of an experienced writer. Unfortunately it reads like a soap opera instead of a holocaust survivor story. There are other stories of this type that are much more worth reading. I do not recommend this book.
5,An excellent handbook to aquarium fish,"While this book does devote a small section to setup and maintenance of an aquarium, this book works best as a reference guide for species info. Hundreds and hundreds of very nice pictures are augmented with good information on each species' water and food requirements, temperament, maximum size, and miscellaneous background information. I've found a few species missing from this book, but even with over 870 species there are bound to be a few left out.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for good, consolodated information on hundreds of fish. It's also good for those trips to the fish store when you don't trust the teenage attendant to give you accurate information about that one fish you really like."
5,Excellent insight to aquarium fishes.,"Dr. Axelrod's Aquarium fishes of the World is an excellent book on freshwater fish. Dr. Axelrod is one of the world's foremost experts of fish and their environments, having a species named after him. This book is a must have even if your not setting up your own aquarium. Great reading!"
4,Good Freshwater Reference Book,"This book is worth the investment. It's almost impossible to cover all freshwater species, but this book does a good job in covering all that may come along. I did not find the X-Ray Tetra but I did find the Ruby Pristella. This section did refer to the Pristella maxillaris or the X-ray Tetra and how similar the two Tetras are. The plant section, while not as well organized, does present a lot of information. There are some typos. If you can forgive these, it is a worthy investment."
2,"A Memorial to What Could Have Been, Dr. Axelrod's Great Downfall","Fish pictures and descriptions are not on the same page making this book difficult to reference. In his day, Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod was the leading ichthyologist of the hobby but after he became the owner of TFH Publications he was driven more by money than accuracy as reflected by most of his later books. This is probably the best of the lot.The downfall of Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod is well documented, from the time of his federal imprisonment to his last known whereabouts in Switzerland, an almost unprecedented fall from grace. Perhaps you should own this book as a memorial to what was and what could have been."
4,The Wiz Motion Picture Soundtrack,"The Wiz is a rich reflection of urban America in the wonderful land of OZ. Quincy Jones shows his versatility here, and the singing performances by the cast are superb.My only hesitation comes from the often weepy songs written for and performed by Diana Ross' character, Dorothy. Other than that, the soundtrack is excellent!"
4,Original Music,The songs sound just like the ones in the movie. Just like home sang by diana is little flat. But over all a very good buy.
5,Believe in YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this soundtrack last summer, and all of the songs on there are JAZZIN'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I especially love ""Ease on Down the Road"" by Diana Ross & Michael Jackson, ""The Emerald City Sequence"" by the cast, ""Everybody Rejoice (Can't You Feel A Brand New Day)"" written by the late Luther Vandross (We'll miss you!), ""Believe"" by Lena Horne, and ""Home"" by Diana Ross. All of these songs have got a lot of heart, soul, and inspiration to every soul in this world. So what if Diana Ross is too old to play Dorothy? She's just bringing out the kid in her, and she did a really good job at it, too. You'll love this soundtrack twice as much as the Broadway edition, so ""ease on down the road"" to your local CD store and buy it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as the broadway...,"To be honest, I found the film version of The Wiz strange. Yes, this CD is impressive, but that's one of the problems. Diana Ross in ""Soon As I Get Home"" is almost laughable. The simpler Broadway cast gives just the right effect. Seeing as Ted Ross and Mabel King were in the Broadway show, their performances were quite good.This CD is missing some songs from the Broadway that I think would sound great if they were in the movie.""Tornado"" would have been awesome in this film if it weren't changed to a snowstorm...It could have use a real ""So You Wanted To Meet The Wizard"" Etc... Broadway's better... :-)"
3,pretty good,this soundtrack is better than the film.the songs that really stand out for me is ease on down the road.and You Can't WIn.one of the greatest Vocal performances in the Great Career of the King Of Pop.this set brought together Two of the Music Worlds Greatest Talents ever Quincy Jones & Michael Jackson.together they changed the world of music and it hasn't been the same since.i wish they would get back together again.
5,Who doesn't love 'The Wiz',"I showed the class that I teach the Wiz and thought it would be great to let them hear the sound track. They love it. I love it. If you love the Wiz, buy this soundtrack. It is the soundtrack from the movie. You will be singing for days."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The performances are technically well done, but lack any ""soul"" or spontaneity."
1,A freshman effort from two who should have done better...,"Lumet and Jones had experience and success when they picked up this project - unfortunately neither had experience or success with adapting a broadway musical to the silverscreen - and it shows - quincy jones obliterated a perfect score with meaningless dribble and sidney lumet miscast and misdirected the rest - what a shame - the original score (music and lyrics) by charlie smalls was perfect, melodic, lyrical & memorable - mr. smalls should have told mr. jones to, ""play it the way i wrote it!"" - all melody is lost, the lyrics are half sung half spoken in some overacted and oddball interpretations - it's a visual mess with a cheesy studio feel - buy the Original Broadway Soundtrack to get a real sense of the music and story - buy tickets to a local production - just don't waste your money on this junk of an adaptation - poor charlie smalls..."
2,"Sadly, the years have not been kind!","Wherein the songs from 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"" are timeless and will be heard for years to come, ""The Wiz"", unfortunately, reflects the period from which it was composed, only enjoyable to those, like myself, that were around at the time of its release. The songs sound like leftovers from ""The Dude"" and other more successful albums,produced and arranged by Quincy Jones.Only ""Believe in Yourself,"" magnificently performed by the legendary Lena Horne, has any lasting value.Perhaps, the failure of this producation to be major hit put a damper on any Broadway revivals of the show that spawned the movie."
3,Nice solo debut,"After hearing Between You & Me I decided I needed to hear more Fabienne Delsol, so I tracked down a CD copy of this, her first solo record I believe & her previous work with the Bristols.Was I disappointed? Not at all, just as good. Musically interesting, great songs & arrangements & musicianship. It just sounds good & every song is strong. What do they say? All killer, no filler? Something like that. Favourite tracks for me would be ""Chills & Fever"", ""There Are Some"" & ""Don't Fall In Love With Me""."
5,VERY PLEASED!,I ORDERED THIS DVD FOR MY GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS. HIS FACE WAS PRICELESS WHEN HE OPENED THIS PRESENT ON CHRISTMAS DAY. HE LOVES BEN 10! AMAZON IS WONDERFUL!!! THANK YOU!GRAMMYJ
3,It makes a good gift to annoy your sister,"As a young man, I found that the greatest value in this book was that I could annoy my sister by giving it to her. Unfortunately, she also found similar value in returning the book to me. As a result, we've both been inspired to great heights of creativity in finding new ways to give this book to each other."
5,A deep look at the private human psyche,"Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather searches to descibe the truth of our personal,critical inner voices. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has questioned their inner voice and wondered if they were alone with their own private meanderings. Prather uses his thoughts and ruminations as philosophical journeys into various stages of emotional and psychological transition. Notes to Myself is a helpful guide to reconnecting with the personal truth. Its format reads quickly and flows in the media of journal enterings. Prather's bold honesty and soul searching are almost always poetic and capable of moving the reader. I often times go back to this book;each time I get something more out of it(a sure criteria for a great book). This book has something to offer anyone over the age of 13."
5,Life-long meditation,"I received this book when I was 18 from my best friend. I recently lent it out and never received it back. I am now 33 and a single working mother of five wonderful children. This book, along with ""The Quiet Answer"", provides my solitude, my motivation, and my inner peace. When the world is falling apart, I seek Hugh Prather's words of wisdom to guide me into his peacefullness. Thank you for such a beautiful work of art."
1,14c is too much,I agree with the reviewers that thought this book a waste of time and money. I see that it is being sold used for 14 cents. I wouldn't pay half that.
5,Food for thoughts,"Helpful insights, makes you be aware of that we all are trying to achieve the same goal in life...become the person we are."
4,Hello Old Friend,"My dad introduced me to this book many years ago. Hugh Prather's comments still ring true. Hugh examines what he says and does as well as what others say and do. He comments on the 'why' of our actions. As he reflects, so do I and it makes me a better person. Thank you, Hugh."
4,Notes to Myself,"I found this book after many years stored away. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it again to find how much wisdom it had. All the theories, spiritual and psychological where all touched upon in this book. It's a little jewel with many levels."
5,Excellent RPG with incredibly well thought out magic rules.,"Highly recommended. Three levels of player character types, tons of customization tips, great setting (medieval europe where every superstition is actually true!) and simple but elegant combay system. Check it out."
1,Toy-like Canister,This canister cleaner has small bags that require frequent changing. The cord is very short making it necessary to unplug it to often. The hose is stiff and doesn't allow for ease of movement. It is very much like a childs toy.
3,Try finding a bag....,I bought this vacuum for my new apartment and it's been great. The biggest problem is finding bags for this model. I looked everywhere in Seattle and they were nowhere to be found. I went to the Eureka web site and you're able to order them there. Great for bare floors and it's small enough to store in a closet.
1,Very Dissatisfied!,The suction on this vacuum is terrible! If you only need it forvery light cleaning its usable but thats about it.
3,ah....classic brain rot,"I watched this all the time when I was a kid....it's good for kids who cant quite figure out a plot, stoners, and those who want to mentally shut off...here you go"
4,Fat but not forgotten,"Well, you've got to like Brits, and you've got to like upper-class Brits, and you've got to like food, and you've got to like to laugh... But if you can say YES to all four, then you're likely to find these shows very entertaining indeed. It's such a charm to spend time with people who don't take themselves too seriously, and who share their love of eating so generously."
4,Two Fat Ladies Rock!,"This set of videos is exactly what I expected-- dry British humor, interesting food preparations and two eccentric ""seasoned"" chefs with a beautiful English backdrop. Clarissa and Jennifer are a hoot and I'd love to have a dinner party with them!"
5,Cooking with glee!,"My Mother was a great cook, but is now confined to a wheelchair. Although she won't be whipping up the recipes, watching the Two Fat Ladies is one of her best sources of entertainment now."
5,2 fat ladies are itchin... to get into your kitchen.....,"omg...if you loved seeing Jennifer and Clarissa on tv... you got to own this. ive waited for... what .... nearly 10 years for this series to finally come out on dvd. and im loving every minute of it. i think you will too. and the last dvd has a wonderful memorial of Jennifer Patterson's life that was amazing, facinating, and funny... God bless her!"
5,wonderful ladies,"These ladies are rare. They are excellent cooks that cook right from the land. No short cuts here. Their sense of humor is delightfull. I would have been honored to have met Jennifer Paterson. Her death was excedingly premature. The world is not for the better without her. The Fat Ladies are bright, well educated, humorous and can never be replaced. They brought alot of joy to my life by watching their shows. I learned alot about cooking and laughed till I hurt. Why they are off the TV I will never understand, and why more VHS and DVD are not avaliable......They are the best."
5,PERSONALITY GALORE!,"I SIMPLY ADORE THIS SERIES!""TWO FAT LADIES ARE A QUICK SPIN ON A MOTORBIKE FOR YOU TASTE BUDS""FUNNY, INFORMATIVE AND A BIT OF EDUCATION AS WELL. NOT YOUR TIPICAL BRITISH COOKERY. SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERNT FROM THESE ""ULTRA"" BORE-ING SIT COM LIKE, SUPER FAST PACED, LOW FAT EVERYTHING, AMERICAN COOKING SHOWS. INSTANLY FELL IN LOVE. ONE OF THE ONLY COOKERY SHOWS I HAVE EVER SEEN COOK USING AN AGA COOKER. SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGA COOKERS IN FACT. IN KITCHENS ALL OVER ENGLAND! WE JUST DO NOT SEE THAT HERE IN AMERICA! PRACTICAL, DELICIOUS RECEPIE'S ONE CAN DO AT HOME. I WATCH THESE OVER AND OVER IN THE KITCHEN WHILE I COOK."
2,I think I am disappointed,"Maybe I was under a false impression, but I expected better, funnier and more appetizing!"
2,Not the same quality as the first 2 seasons,"Just a short feedback. I have the first 2 discs, their quality is OK, given the fact that this is an old cartoon. The second package is brilliant, very nice with the musical cover.But this one, what a mess. Lousy package and bad video quality. What happened? The picture is not sharp, there are artifacts and the video is somewhat degraded. Are the originals ruined or did they just change the supplier, to a cheap and low quality one?As I don't see anyone complaining, I wonder if I had bad luck and my disc is defective.Please, if someone else reads this and agrees, please leave a feedback, so others can know about the quality before buying.In any case, it was good to see those episodes once more. I hope they do better in the next volume."
3,"Great cartoons, but DVD has some deficiencies","The cartoons are terrific, cheesy or both depending on your point of view, but they're pure Speed Racer so if you like nostalgia or sharing these old cartoons with your children, be sure to add this to your collection. I would give this set a higher rating just for the cartoons, but the packaging is a real issue for this volume in the Speed Racer collection, hence my 3-star rating.All the problems with this release relate to the packaging, which does not live up to the quality and inventiveness of the previous two volumes. The packaging does not adequately protect the DVD and the fact that there are no extras is a real shame. It would be GREAT if the producers of this DVD collection would put the orginal Japanese version of the theme song and opening titles on one of these volumes as an extra feature. Instead, there are no extras at all, fun or not, on this release."
4,"Great Picture Quality, Lousy Packaging","I picked this up today and found that the picture quality was on par with the earlier versions. Perfect for completists like me!The packaging for this volume is far inferior to those for the other two volumes. The disc is packaged in a circular tin with lightweight sponge material protecting the data side of the disc. The tin is shrinkwrapped with a cardboard insert that the tin slips into halfway; don't discard this piece of cardboard, as it (and not the tin!) lists the episodes. It'll be very easy for the disc to get chipped if one isn't careful; there's some bounce room inside that tin for the disc to travel. Not a great package, in sum.My volume doesn't look anything like the Amazon picture, either; the tin is embossed like a faux steering wheel, and the front of the cardboard insert has the Speed Racer logo along with pictures of Racer X, Trixie, and a few of the gang.Again -- great product. Lousy packaging."
5,GO Speed Racer,"A great classic that cant be beat....I'm gettin all the seasons,....They just dont makem like this anymore"
3,speed racer dvd review,"It was nice to see the original cartoon shows once again after many, many, years."
2,Misadvertized,"Though these pill pockets are very effective (and tasty) for dispensing medication to my cat, the Amazon web page clearly shows the ingredients to include probiotics. The 6-pack of Greenies which I ordered and received from Pet Vet Vitamin Shop do not list any probiotics in the ingredients on the packages. This merchant was unable to explain the discrepancy."
1,Misplaced in the Library,"This was one sorry book. Out of 126 pages, maybe 8 of them were helpful. It should have been listed as a book of cheesy quotations rather than of wedding toasts. And what is point of all those pictures (about 25 in total) ? Please, save your money..."
4,"A pretty good Wi-Fi ""radio""","OK, it's not a radio. It's really a stand-alone web browser with good speakers and and audio amp. But that's being picky.If you have a wireless network in your home, or are within range of one at work, you can listen to Internet radio without booting up your computer. The controls are a little confusing at first, but easily learned. Once you've programmed a few stations, it's pretty much like using the presets on a normal radio.A very neat device with lots of features. A little pricey, perhaps."
5,Great!,"This radio deserves its stars. It worked right out of the box (router required). Audio quality is probably not up to classical music, but is certainly adequate for normal listening. It does not tie up the computer. And we can listen to any one of thousands of stations, just like short wave only better. My only quibble would be that this radio may not be necesssary in a metropolitan area where there are many FM stations available over the air -- we live in a small desert town where we only get two NPR stations, with a large antenna, and sometimes even that is questionable. We like it well enough that we are thinking of getting a second one so we don't have top move the first one around so much."
1,Do not recommend,"While I agree that this product seemed to work OK out of the box (although the on/off switch did not work and this was worrysome....you could turn it off by unpluging or turning the volume down), Some of the preprogrammed stations did not work, so I followed the instructions regarding updating and that was the end of the radio. I'm glad I did it within 30 days of purchase so I could return it...I certainly would not recommend this radio."
2,"I Love Larry, But . . . .","If you're a fan of either Larry or Ian, you'll recognize every word in this book, verbatim. It's all taken from other material by these two men. Since I already read everything Larry Winget wrote, his ""answers"" were simply quotes from other (more effective) books.If, however, you've never read Larry or Ian, this book will be a nice introduction to their very different approaches to self-help, motivation, and life in general."
1,National Socialism = Nazism,"This book is basically revisionist history. It is well known that ""National Socialism"" is not socialism at all, but Nazism. The author glorifies Hitler's Germany and the Nazi party. For any good that the author claims that came of Nazism, the party fails on the points of democracy and inclusiveness for all people. This is why the Nazi's killed off not only minorities and Jewish people throughout Europe, but also true socialists and communists."
5,Pilates - with new awareness (combine with book),"I always thought these simple movements and breathing techniques were boring. But combined with the book:Pilates on the Ball: The World's Most Popular Workout Using the Exercise BallI began to understand how to isolate the deep core muscles, rather than using the larger. stronger hip and outer abdominal muscles.The exercises are done slowly (which takes strength, concentration, and awareness).This has been a help in improving my posture. I am 78 years old, and keeping a strong straight spine while walking has become a challenge.I think this combo of book and DVD would be useful for younger people too. Never too soon to understand how your body works. And make sure the deepest muscles are engaged.P.S. I bought the KINDLE ed. Apparently the paper ed comes with a DVD (who knew!) - However, Moira Stott, on this DVD, was Colleen Craig's teacher! And it would be interesting to compare the DVDs."
2,Screen Protector,"A lot of money to pay for one sheet of screen protector! It doesn't go on easily and has a lot of bubbles which you can't get out after you put the screen protector on. Also, difficult to get off after it is on. I'd look for another screen protector next time."
2,Low Quality,"Your local pet store might not carry hermit crab shells, but if you ask them they just might order some for you. They would probably be much higher quality than these. They are very thin shells compared to ones I have purchased at supply stores and are too expensive for only 2 shells.Save your money and your crabs frustrations and buy another brand or buy local."
4,Author of Survival Meditations for Parents of Teens,I just love how the Dobson's bring God's message into parenting.If your kids are a little older you might want to check out my book on surviving parenting the teens years...with God's help of course!
5,Good for families,"This is a really good book for couples who are raising children. I would wait to get it until your children are about three years old, though. Many of the questions in the book deal with discipline and other concerns that young children aren't really going through. This is a good daily devotional for couples who are raising children. It makes you think about things together and learn to be better parents."
2,Disapointing,"Not at all what I was expecting. Does not do the band or the fans justice. The ""coverband"" audio tracks of some of Thin Lizzy's better known songs is pathetic. Not an outright abomination, but doesn't even come close to representing the band and what they were about live and in the studio. No interview or insight from Gorham, Downey, Robbo, White, Wharton, or Moore. More or less a waste of my hard earned money. Try again!"
3,Still Waiting,"This IS better that the HORRIBLE ""Boys are back in town"" (whose sole redeeming feature is Gary Moore's participation). But being a HUGE Lizzy fan (seen them 3 times beginning in 1977) I'm still waiting on the DVD releases of Live and Dangerous (and please...the whole thing NOT the castrated version released on VHS) and Dedication, to say nothing of the Rock Masters show. Until then I will not be happy. In fact I could make a list of 30-40 magnificent VHSs that are not yet on DVD."
5,I finally found it!!!!,I was first introduced to this the book over 10yrs ago as a college freshman. Its great collection of stories and poems about the central valley in California. I have no idea what happened to my first copy but Im very excited to finally have another.
5,"Outstanding - I lived there (1933-1951) real, honest,moving","Having lived on the fringes of 99, Bay Area-Delta (Antioch, Brentwood) I know the Okie stories from living it, cutting ""cots"" the whole 9-yards. These are wonderful writers because they lived their words."
5,"If you want to change any in your life, read this book","I read this book for recomendation of my friend Ken, the same day that i read it, i begin to change any thinks for me in bad stage. Read it, and change that thinks, that you don't like.Escuse me, my english is too bad."
2,Disfunctional Top Pully & Table,"I bought this hoping that it would be a good upgrade for my 1970's DeWalt. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a mistake. The spring-loaded cantilevered top pully may be the poorest design going. I started by replacing the 16g 125v lead with a 12g 250v cord. It now starts faster but jerks the spring on the top-pully and eats the belt. I've tried holding the tension handle but the entire mounting system gets tweaked somehow and the belt won't stop racing off until it's too late. I've been tweaking tools for 30 years and this is the first one that has me thinking that Craig's List is the best solution. I've also been cruising the blogs hoping that some aspiring engineer will sell after-market fixes for this Grizzly embarassment! Don't buy this model. Buy something that has 2-bearings on both pullys."
4,Good Value single with 5 songs,"Hallways - good song, showing a calmed down side from their previous albumEasy (remix) - awesome remix, heavier on the bass and drumMental note - another awesome b side, very much in a similar vein to one quarter of one hourElectricity (live) - should be a familiar song with all fans, good live rendition, not much you can change in a song like this though for a live versionSnapshot - an instrumental, pretty rare from SFK but not bad, gentle warbling song which is a nice end to the single"
3,Mobile Action MA-8280P USB Data Cable for Samsung M640,"Does not install its own drivers, if other drivers were previously installed. Does not handle ringers. Does not allow you to define Contacts fields. Interface is clean and relatively easy to use. Allows easy movement of photos, movies, and music."
1,Stay away from it,"All of my other phones are Motorola, so I had to by this software for my wife's Samsung Sync.I could never get it to work. After crashing my computer 3 times, I just gave up."
1,Piece of Junk,"I used this for 10 minutes and was impressed that it was sucking up so much. The Owner's Guide isn't that useful so I struggled to get the brush to work on the carpet (you have to switch a toggle back and forth). Finally I did and it worked well. Then I sucked up the fringe of a rug by mistake. I do that sometimes with my other two vacuums, and I just turn them off and it's not big deal. But with the Eureka I IMMEDIATELY smelled burning rubber! Horrified, I quickly turned it off. I turned it back on and the roller brush wouldn't turn. Long story short, I unscrewed the bottom and realized 1) the roller was not new (lots of scaring) and 2) the BELT was broken! It just arrived today! You have to be kidding me - now I need to take it in, or return it. I'm am very upset about this. Also, this vacuum is VERY HEAVY!! Not worth it if you have a house with wood floors and area rugs -- too much switching between settings."
2,ha ha ha!!!,"who said that this album is a good one? in Germany the guy is very popular but many fans hated him also,.....the songs he wrote had been sung by Thomas anders. Bohlen is a scandal maker in germany..."
5,"some songs are great, but weird drawing.","i must confess that the drawing on the jacket is wrong. the painter does not know albert king. albert king is ""left handed"" guitarist. the jacket drawing must be corrected. as an albert king fan the drawing is just not acceptable."
5,Great Beginner Book,"This is a great book that easily transitions between topics and is well written(unlike most other programming books). Also, when I had a few questions , I e-mailed the author and he personally gave me a book reccomendation for what to read next...(He suggest reading Soustroupe's advanced material)..."
3,Non Fiction,"A pretty reasonable textbook for an introduction to the C++ language and a beginning look at object oriented programming and all the data structures and templates and other techniques that this entails.Methods, operator overloading, constructors, destructors, class members, programming structure, syntax, all that sort of stuff."
2,A good fill in book,"I bought this along with several other books on Montana. Its a good resource and has a lot of information, but I found it was hard to use. It was more like a textbook that required me to dig and take notes. While they did provide a few maps, they were sketchy and really didn't help me find where things were located. This is compared to the Montana Roadside Directory which I found to be nicely laid out, and easy to use. I would still recommend the purchase of this if your planning a trip as a supplement to other information. It was my second favorite book of the several I bought."
1,Poor Quality...,"This brand used to be the best for car mats and I owned a set of these so-called premium mats for each of my vehicles. However, they now only last for a couple of months and holes wear completely through the mats. I e-mailed Kraco and asked what happened to the quality of their car mats, but never got a response. I now call these disposable mats and do not recommend."
3,Expo Dry erase markers,"The markers are great, however the eraser part falls off easily. You can put it back on, but then it doesn't stay very well. Other than that, the colors and the grip of the markers are great."
4,Response to Uninformed Review,"The previous reviewer obviously has not read the book that he rated so low. Harold J. Rosen is an Honorary member of The Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), an honor given to few CSI members. This book, in its first edition, predates the CSI Manual of Practice, and it has been updated over several decades.Construction Specifications Writing: Principles and Practices has been the leading textbook for teaching construction specifications at colleges and universities.The 4th edition has been superseded by an expanded and updated 5th edition, co-authored by this reviewer, that is consistent with the CSI Manual of Practice and includes more examples and resources than CSI's MOP."
4,Good product,"I have found this text to be highly useful in explaining the purpose and content of specifications. The text provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of what should be in a specification. The only thing that might have been better was if the authors had spent more time on the technical specs and less on the EJCDC and other standard items that do not appreciably change. All in all though, this is an excellent text and well worth the price."
2,not the same layout as print,"This is one of my largest complaints of the kindle system as a whole. This book is a dynamic book, meaning that the page is sized for the text. The problem with this feature is twofold. First, the parts lists are difficult to reference quickly. Second, a page cannot be referenced by page number (as is done in most lecture classes). It would be a great Kindle feature if you could choose between standard book layout styled print and dynamic pages (depending on your personal preference or quality of eyesight). Until then, this book is best bought as a hard copy."
4,Good gift for 1/2 off,It's a nice gift for the $19.99 price. The full price would have been far too much. I love Spring Rain so I'm ordering another one as a gift and one for myself.
1,Be careful of this doctor's advice,"Although Darshak Sanghavi seems like an intelligent doctor with impressive credentials, I would heed caution to some of the advice he offers. In various publications and this book Darshak gives medical advice that he has no right giving. He often states things as fact when it is really just personal opinion and has even gone as far as to referring to studies without doing his due diligence."
5,Country Stars,"God bless all you real country lovers. This CD is Roots Music. Please check it out. I am a lover of Surenuff Texas Honky Tonk.But these ol'timers had it all figgerd out. WE FOUGHT WARS AND DID OUR DUTY!!. Give this a listen,from our roots. You won't be sorry. Where it all started. Jimmy Rogers would have been proud."
2,Doesn't light up,This item didn't work. It's cute but not happy with the fact that this is the second one I have purchased and neither worked.
2,Disappointed in CD,I was extremely disappointed that this was NOT the 2 CD set advertised on TV. Not only is it heavily censored (words that the radio versions allow are bleeped out) but the Live song has been edited so that the entire first stanza is missing.
4,Newspeak Ballads,"A pretty good compilation of songs. I would have given it 5 stars, but they put the edited radio versions of each song on the CD...which means no potty-mouth. Whenever a banned word comes up, they figure out some way to mute the singing, or cover it up with some noise. I always found this practice completely annoying, but hey, It's not as bad as the old days when they just covered it with a tone. It is however, ridiculously excessive in Everlast's ""What It's Like""."
3,not too satisfied,"I misunderstood when I bought this album I thought I was getting both discs. What a bummer! Anyway, the disc I got wasn't too bad. It is fun to go back a few years and remember special moments from high school."
2,Should have paid more attention,Thought it was the 32 song cd set. NOPE!!!Missing more than 10 songs!Not as seen on tv.It sucks but I guess it was pretty cheap.
3,"Tracks are censored, and this is not the ""As Seen on TV"" 2 CD Set","Like several people have already commented, this is NOT the 2 CD set advertised on TV. It's only one CD, with a mix of songs from the 2 CD version.Also, some of the tracks are censored (notably track 1); considering that it costs a bit more than most CDs, you might expect to be getting the full, unedited, original songs, but you don't quite.Still, all songs that I love."
2,Music Selection,I expected the same genre of music but it wasn't in my opinion. I was disappointed in the variety.
1,FAKE CD,THIS IS NOT THE CD SEEN ON TV.........THIS CD CONTAINS ONLY 18 SONGS THAT ARE EDITED AND NOT THE REAL SONGS.I WASTED MY MONEY
3,Buzz Ballads,"This is a great cd. The only thing is I guess I thaught this was a two disk set, maybe I just didn't read the the discription well.Anyway I plan to eventually get Buzz Ballads #2."
1,Misrepresentation,This cd is a single disc instead of two. It has some of the same songs but not all of them. stay away from this product.
4,Not the 2 CD collection,This is the best of the 2 CD collection. One of the better compliations out there.
1,Smells Like Teen Spirit - by Tory Amos?????,"Can you please have songs sung by the artists that created them. Nirvana did Smells Like Teen Spirit. I find it insulting tha the greatest band of the ninetys didn't make the album, but their song did being sung by someone else. Come on folks you went through the trouble of putting his wife on there!"
1,One cd????????,The buzz ballads cd is a two cd set - this was a compilation of the songs put into one cd- not happy
2,Not the 2 CD set as advertised on TV.,"It was my mistake, I thought it was the 2 CD set, just like I was about to order on TV. Unfortunately this was just 1 CD (half the songs as advertised on the commercial). So when you order make sure you get the 2 CD set.Other than that the songs were good, and the CD was new in the wrapper."
1,Wrong CD Listed Online,"I bought this CD thinking it was the 2 CD set I saw in the commercial, and I was wrong. It is a single CD with only half of what the TV version has."
3,Not as seen on TV.,"Firstly, this is not the two-disk set you've seen on TV. It is just one CD. So bear that in mind when pondering your purchase. That said, it is a decent compilation of some memorable hits from the last eight or ten years and makes an excellent gift for that friend or family member we all have who just can't move on from their highschool days. A solid C."
1,Buzz Ballads,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you can sell a knock off of something you should at least say it is!!!!! This isn't even the real Buzz Ballad!!!! Thats A LOT!
3,"Good Music, but not many songs for the price","The song selection is fine, but the collection seemed a bit overpriced for what you get."
1,arg,"All I have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads. It really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are.Ballad--A ballad is a story, usually a narrative or poem, in a song. Any story form may be told as a ballad, such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form. It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.Some good examples of ballads:The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Ballad of Jesse James,Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier,Ode to Billie JoeWhile there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not. The same goes with that Monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock."
2,missing CD,This Cd was to have been a set (as advertised on TV). No wonder it was less expensive than the one advertised.
2,upset,"When making the purchase I was unaware that there was both a double disc and a single disc version of this product. When i researched it I only found the double version. I thought I was buying the double version and did not see any disclaimer that there are different versions and I needed to check which one I was buying. Had I known this was a single disc version, knowing only about a double disc version being available I would not have made the purchase."
4,good selection,This is a good selection of artist. It is a good mix of easy to listen to music to music that will get your heart going and you singing along.
5,Zippo Review,"A true gem of the zippos, excellent art work by Mazzi, truly beautifull. A great lighter for the collector or for everyday use. Excellent!"
4,Good value,Good value. Runs just slightly large. Why do reviews require so many words even for something so simple? Word word.
4,Does the job.,"Comfortable leather shooting glove. Good price for good product. Take some time to get it nice and ""broke in"", but after that the comfort level is where you'd expect it to be. Hope this helps"
3,so-so,"while they work, kind of hard so a little conditioner and they are usable, so for the price are ok."
1,Cheap. Junk.,"I tried it on, then it went directly in the trashcan. My title explains it all.I blame myself though. Should have spent more money on something of better quality."
1,Airplanes Book,"This book was grossly over-priced. The ""color"" encyclopedia would imply the book to be in color. The book was very small and black and white for a $50 charge"
4,Very Acceptable Performance at a Surprisingly Low Price Point,"This is obviously not one of those high-end $100+ headsets with a really finely-balanced feel to it, and it is certainly not cordless.That being said, this unit works very well, and provides a high level of sound quality, and is reasonably comfortable in its fit.What is really surprising is the price, which is shockingly low for such a relatively good-quality headset. I'm impressed."
3,ok for shorter calls,"The headset has a longer than normal cord, but it's still not that long. The volume is good. The negative is that it is not that comfortable to wear for very long. My previous headset was a VoiceStar which was much more comfortable."
4,Awesome,Works great with my panasonic cordless. I hear them and they hear me just fine. I love hands free. No more neck cramps too. Can't beat the price either.
3,Panasonic headset,A good unit but with one flaw if you take it on and off repeatly as I do. There is a weak spot in the headband where the over the head band adjusts. Other than that they are a great unit.
5,Favorite headset so far...,I figured this would be like every other hands free I have purchased in the past. This one is very clear and loud. I will likely buy a few more...as I'm very satisfied.
4,Headset for home phone,The Headset works but hard for people to hear you. Wanted it to be hands free while talking on the phone.
1,A major disappointment.,"I work at home and I purchased this along with the Panasonic KX-TG7622b phone since both the Amazon and the Panasonic web sites indicated that they would work together. However, when I unpacked the phone, I noticed that there was no place to plug in this headset. My only other option is a Bluetooth headset and I find them uncomfortable to wear all day."
1,Died in less than 2 weeks--Beware,I bought this handsfree headset and expected value since it was inexpensive..but never expected it to not work after a few weeks...So beware...
3,Not as good as stated,Aftar reding so menney great reviews on this headset decided on getting one for my self. Don't like it all incoming calls sounds low maybe it's just the Panasonic Kxtg1032s not the headset.
2,Poor audio quality,This headset has poor audio quality - lots of voice breaks. It must be a fault cable or the headset is not up to the mark. I use this for daily conference call - and looking for an alternate product. Not very comfortable to wear either - slips off the head...uncomfortable mic placement.
1,Is this thing supposed to feel like a vise?,It HURTS too much to wear this thing! Did they forget that human beings were going to be trying to WEAR it?
4,Works Great with Panasonic cardless,This headset works great with Panasonic carless phone. I am unsing it for lot of conference calls from last 1 month.I have no issues with voice quality.It is best handset available for less than $10.
5,Worth the money,"Comfortable, I wear it for hours at a time. Has yet to fail me and never a complaint from somebody on the other end, except maybe to tell me to shut up."
3,Not altogether happy with this headset,"I had high hopes for this very reasonably priced head set because I'd gotten some referrals from others who were happy with theirs. However, they don't use it for professional and group calls. The transmission of my voice is fuzzy and the volume not good. I'll be returning it for a better one."
1,Disappointing - Unacceptable Sound Quality,I work from home and spend a ton of time on my landline. I am looking for a good headset - one that delivers excellent sound quality at a reasonable price. I am very disappointed by this headset - sound quality is very poor - it cuts in and out and is too quiet. I tried it all day yesterday on my many conference calls and it received an overall negative vote. A few people said it sounded OK but the majority of people I interact with had trouble hearing me. Not acceptable - back it goes.
1,"1 Star Headset, 5 Stars for Amazon","I purchased this headset for the home office. It worked well at first, but within the first week it was very staticy like I've read in other reviews. I'm usually pretty gentle with electronics, but maybe it was the way I stored the cord by wrapping it around the ear and support pieces on either side of the headset. If that's the case it's very touchy since I wrapped it loosely. That being said, Amazon refunded my money without me having to send the headset back. I tossed the headset in the electronic recycling bin. My company purchased a Plantronics MX500i 3-in-1 Headset (also sold at Amazon) and it works great. It works well with the home office analog phone and VoIP software phone. I also use this when I travel so it stands up to not so ideal storage in my backpack.Since there's so many positive reviews for this headset, I'd recommend trying it out because you may get a good one. If it doesn't work, try the Plantronics headset mentioned above."
5,Works great on the PC too! Simply the best headset.,My favorite headset by far is the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband. It is comfortable and sounds great. The only issue was plugging it into my PC.I purchased the Headset Buddy Adapter 01-PH25-PC35 Phone Headset to PC Adapter and this solved the problem and worked great.I am in a loud location so I still had just a very small amount of background hum when on the PC. In Windows 7 I adjusted the properties to add Noise Suppression and now it sounds like I am in a silent room.
5,Nice Addition to Any Phone with Headset Capability,"We purchased this headset along with an ATT Cordless Phone Set. Just plug it into your phone, and if you have a cordless phone, clip the phone to your pants........and you are free to roam and talk completely hands free. No more having to stop what you are doing just to be able to talk on the phone.Crystal Clear Reception and Comfortable on your head.Great Product.....Highly Recommend."
4,easy for walking and talking at the same time.,I find this convenient for walking and talking with cordless phone. It is easier to carry the phone around in your hand than to hold it to your ear where I inadvertently move it away from my mouth. You can also set the phone down without losing contact if you need both hands. I had a problem adjusting the volume down but solved that by moving the ear piece off center. I am satisfied with it.
4,Headset works good,"I read other reviews on this product and decided that it has to be, at least, worth the price.My wife uses this headset, she does handle it gently, but has had no problem with it breaking. She periodically has trouble with people hearing her but that is a problem we have had forever with economy headsets.Overall, it was well worth the small price we paid for it."
4,Great headset,I purchased this item as a gift for my mother. She reports that it works well and is very comfortable to wear.
2,"Good at first, but breaks fast","I loved this product so much I bough another one after the first. Then they both broke. Pay more or just avoid altogether. I used to use it to talk to my ex-girlfriend. So I don't need it now, but was worth it at the time. I wish I had just paid double the price & gotten one good headset, instead of having two broken headphone. I think anyone would agree."
4,Good Product For The Price,"Good headset for the price. No frills or gimicks, just a good headset for $10."
2,Panasonic KX-TCA60,"I had one that was still working, but thought it time for another one for a back up as I use it a lot, upon receiving it, I called my friend in Fl and said Hi, what do you think, she said huh? I can't hardly hear you, I checked to make sure it was turned on, than checked volume and yes it was up, so I moved it all the way down and then all the way back up and still had to speak very load to be heard, as for hearing her, it was not nearly as well as I could hear her on my old set, so I probably over rated this product, panasonic used to make good products but seems latley every thing I buy from them is not up to standards. If you want to yell while talking on this product then it is for you, I would not buy this product again."
1,Had to return this item,"Interestingly, this headset does not fit small heads. I'm a small woman and the headband cannot be made small enough for this to fit. Never got to see if it worked. Sad."
2,Not so hot,This unit started cracking and allowing a lot of white noise after less than 6mo. I threw them out and bought another pair.
5,Skip the others.,"Right. This works great. For a woman. Its small, lightweight and I can talk and hear and walk around with this thing, clip the phone to my hip and I'm in heaven. Also great for talking on the phone and typing on the computer at the same time / like the professionals do - but don't expect professional sound quality - the sound is excellent but not studio - but as good as any upscale phone would sound. Love that the microphone is 100% adjustable (I can drink or eat while talking and typing!). Oh brother - too much multi-tasking, but you know, the world just won't wait! Buy one if you simply need to talk and type or talk and do just about anything else with you cel or landline/hands free. Sound only in one ear, but the headpiece and mike is reversable (left or right side) - so whatever is more comfy for you. If you have simple needs - don't spend more. Buy."
4,A good tool for the phone so you can be hands free...,"I like using this headphone when I want to be hands free. it is a bit awkward after long periods of time, but it does the trick for a low price!"
1,Minus 5,"(Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband--to go with the 4 Panasonic cordless phones I also purchased.) Since there are no negative stars as to ratings, I can not express my rating. Maybe a minus 5, if that is as low as you might go. I bought 2 headsets (1) Oct 12, 2011) and (2) Sept 29, 2011) Within 3 months both had stopped working.I am not a happy camper, and it seems I am stuck with these purchases since the return time is up."
1,What? Can't hear you. What did you say? Hello? Hello?,"Nobody could hear me. That's a problem when talking with clients; they say they can't hear me, and yes, it's plugged into an (expensive) Panasonic phone, and that's the long and short of it. I could hear them, but I have to be able to communicate clearly with clients, and when they say they can't hear me, I've got to pick up the handset or put them on speaker. It needs an amplifier. Just plan and simple, it doesn't pick up and send the sound to the other person. Yes, I have adjusted the mike so it's near my mouth, and around a few different spots, does not matter. Otherwise it's comfortable, cheap, and looks OK. Maybe I can sell it on Craig's list for a profit....?"
2,a little too large,"I received the headset in a timely enough matter, but find it is a little too large and I have a large head!! It doesn't adjust down far enough to keep it comfortably on my head while driving.....I wear hearing aids, so a blue tooth is out of the question....Guess I'll just try to find someone with a bigger head to wear it!!!!"
4,My Wife Won't Take It Off!!!!,"I bought this for my wife three months ago, and that dummy won't take the darn thing off!!! I'm all, 'Honey, time for dinner!' and she shows up with the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset strapped to her gigantic dome!!! I was all, 'Nuh-uh!' but there she was, yammerin away to her momma in rootstown.She e'en wore it in the showers the other week, and though it got all wet, I do think it still is a-working.Brouhahahaha!!!"
2,"Good start, but a month later...","When Washington state banned cell phone use while driving, I invested in several headsets. Listeners agreed that this was the clearest of the lost, so I settled on using it. And a month later, they reported that the sound quality had degraded to the point of unintelligibility. Lots of clicks and other background noise. So my search continues."
4,Comfortable but cord is too long.,"Very comfortable fit.However, the cord is about 12 inches too long and tends to catch on things as you walk around.Shorten the cord and this would be 5 stars."
4,headset,It only has hearing on one side which I find to be weird. The volume should be higher also since you are only listening on one side. It doesn't sit right on the head...for me. I do enjoy being handfree though.
1,iPhone Users Beware - Not 3.5mm Plug,"Panasonic has dropped the ball on their headsets. They have yet to make one tailored for the iPhone.This headset requires an adapter as it has a 2.5mm plug.Additionally, it is a mono plug and not a stereo plug.The adapter for the iPhone you want has a stereo 3.5mm plug that drops one channel and coverts it to a mono output for the mono plug of this headset.It is hard to say which adapters do this properly to avoid shorting left and right output channels from the iPhone 3 & 4.Cellet, available on Amazon, has a 3.5mm stereo plug that mates appropriately to the iPhone 4.Check it out before you buy this model.Hopefully Panasonic will introduce a headset with a 3.5mm stereo plug in the future to properly mate to an iPhone without an adapter.I do like the Panasonic brand generally and the fit of their headsets."
2,Don't know yet!,"I purchased it to be used with a new phone, but I had problems with the new phone. The initial feedback was it did not sound good. Kept it anyway (should have returned) and I will try it again once I replace the phone."
1,not a fit for the phone,"I can't really say how well this headset works, because it did not match for use with the Vtech CS6219-2 DECT 6.0 Expandable 2-Handset Cordless Phone System with Caller ID and Handset Speakerphone (CS6219-2) that I purchased at the same time. It IS comfortable to wear, but that is as far as I was able to get. I thought I was doing my home work, because it was listed as something that was frequently purchased by people who also bought the Vtech phone, but I didn't realize that the plug jack was not a match. I am hoping I may find a use for it yet. A little misleading if you are not into the minute details of these devices."
4,basic headset,"It gets the job done and just works. A simple 2.5mm headset.Pros:*Noise canceling mic (they will hear you but not everything around you).*Doesn't pick up your breathing.*good sound quality on mic and earpiece for phonecalls.*Not too uncomfortable. (unless worn for long periods, then it feels bothersome)*Reversible.Cons:*No mute/volume controls.*Can't hear yourself in the earpiece. Since the padding muffles outside sound you have wear it off center be able to hear yourself normally in that ear.*Constantly reminds you that you are wearing a headset because of what I list below:**A-symmetrical.**Very little padding on non earpiece side.**Mic has to be right in front of your mouth or you will sound muffled. This puts it in your peripheral vision."
4,Good value for the money,"I bought this at the end of 2007, used it every weekday since, and it finally broke yesterday. I was comfortable wearing it, I got good audio on my end and my callers didn't report any problems on theirs. I'm not even bothering to shop; I'm just going to get another."
4,Great headset for the price,"For less than fifteen dollars, this is a fantastic headset. I've definitely worn more well-made devices over the years that adjust the mouthpiece and headset size more smoothly, but at this price, the sound is great and plug in was perfect.Plus, the package was easy to open (none of that needing a blowtorch to get the plastic package cut open!)"
1,I can't believe I bought this again!,"This headphone is very uncomfortable to wear - it is too big, so if you snug the headband to your skull, it collides with your ear (I do not have a small head) if you don't snug it up, it slips off. You cannot adjust the end of the head clip and it digs into your head at a sharp angle. If you try, you will snap off the end. I would return this but the shipping would cost almost as much at the unit itself. I wish I could give zero stars for durability and wearing comfort.There is no volume control or mute.the mike is too big and it gets in your way (when it is not sliding away from your mouth.I would not have bought it except that the picture was lacking enough in detail that I did not notice it was the same as the one I already had. There is no product number or model number on the unit itself.Ack! I HATE this product!"
1,Broke in 100 days and no consideration from Panasonic,"This headset seemed like a bargain and got rave reviews. at about 100 days after puchase (and probably used a dozen times) the microphone completely stopped working. Called Panasonic and they said sorry, over 90 days, buy another. Only good thing about this is that I only spent $15 for something going off to the landfill. I would not recommend purchasing this headset - unbelievably poor quality!!!"
2,Won't last a year,"The headset was good for about 6 or 7 months. It worked fine, then as most headset are apt to do, it started to go. I started to hear static and then the band on the headset snapped in two. I don't know that headsets are good for more than a year. Another headset added to landfill. Would pay more for one that lasted."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product. I purchased it to replace an older headset that I have had for years and was wearing out. When I first used this I noticed the sound volume and quality were much worse than I was used to. People I was meeting with via conference call said they could not hear me very well, which has never been a problem before. I am going back to my original one."
1,"OK, then quickly broke","The microphone on mine stopped working after 3 months. Panasonic wanted $30 to ""repair"" it. It was OK while it worked, but ultimately not worth buying."
2,AT@T headset better for home phone use,"AT&T HEADESET A BETTER BUY!!! I live for my headset at home. It allows me to get all my work around the house and home office done without being tied down to a phone. I found the panasonic to be ok. To tight on my ear, gave me a headache and the boom for the mouth piece was to big and not flexible. For a great headset I highly recommend the AT@T H420 for $17.99. The headset is lightweight and adjustable. The mouthpiece does not get in the way like the panasonic and is very flexible. You can also adjust the volume or mute the call right on the AT@T headset. The panasonic did not have this option. So if you like to be mobile while chatting, get the AT@T and do not waste your time with this panasonic!!!"
1,Not a great headset,"There is an echo sound when using this headset. If you touch the plug while using the headset, it creates static on the line. Not impressed with this headset."
1,Wasted money,This is by far the worst business product I have ever purchased. It provides static-full conversations and an undesired humming that makes you run for the handset.
5,Look no further,"I bought this headset to replace a Radio Shack model that I've used for years. The cord went bad, and I went back to Radio Shack only to find they stopped making it. At the time, I tested all the expensive, well-known models, and no one could hear me. Very frustrating. I read the reviews here, and knew that in the case of headsets, you don't always get what you pay for. I gave this headset a chance, and it's great. I'm told I sound just like I'm using the handset. The sound on my end is not quite as clear as my old Radio Shack model, but it's plenty good. You won't be disappointed. It's fairly comfortable too. I guess I should mention that I use it with a Panasonic cordless phone. I'm not sure if that makes a difference."
2,"bad fit, flimsy","This headset seemed ok when I got it. But....the headband is not adjustable and is too large for my head. I can't walk around and do things because it falls off. And as with all headsets that have the 90-degree connector, the wires break where they enter the connector and it stops working. It loses volume and then you start hearing an echo. These things don't last more than a couple of months even with exquisite care. I would much rather pay more and get a better one but it seems everything out there has the same design problems with the 90 degree cord. I'd much rather have a straight connection on the cord and can't imagine why they insist on this built-in obsolescence 90 degree connector."
2,Not what I hoped,"I've been disaapointed with this product. I use it at work and clients complain that they can't hear me or that there is an echo, and I had to get an adapter for it to work with my office phone."
2,Not reliable,"Initially, sound was good compared with the competition. But within a couple of weeks, I started getting all sorts of crackling sounds. The problem is probably in the submini phone plug making a poor connection with the handset. I had the same trouble with several handsets.I have put the product in the trash."
5,Very good headset!,"This was my second order for the Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset. I have parrots and sometimes they bite through my headset cord before I can stop them. I've tried several headsets over the years, but the Panasonic KX-TCA60 outshines anything I've ever used, especially for the price! I will buy more very soon."
2,Bad sound,"I compared it to my falling-apart cheap GE headset. The sound from this headset's microphone is nowhere near as good. I recorded two voice mail messages, one from the old headset and the other from this headset. The sound from this headset is muffled but the cheap falling-apart GE headset sound is great.I'm returning this one. However, I would appreciate any tips ond finding a replacement for the GE. I've tried several and the microphone sound is the same - muffled and inadequate for business calls. I've received complaints about every new headset of this type. Help.Maybe cheap headsets were better made five years ago. I'm at a loss."
4,Good enough value for the money,"If you are looking for a low cost effective headset for a cordless phone this is a good choice. No bells or whistles but it has good enough sound and is loud enough. A faint buzz can be heard but only by the user. Everyone I call says I sound fine. I bought it for the long flexible microphone so it could go right in front of my mouth. When I use a headset with a shorter mike on the side of the mouth people can't hear me well. There's no volume controls or mute button, just so you know. I would buy it again."
4,Great deal - works well,"for the price, this is a great deal. I've used it daily for almost a year with no problems. With my phone, the earpiece is a bit too loud (I can't turn the volume down enough sometimes) and the mouthpiece a bit too soft (sometimes people say that I need to be louder), however both of those things could come from other factors as well. Audio quality seems good. My baby has pulled on it a bit and hasn't damaged it yet. Fit is flexible but strong. It's no more than your basic headset with no frills, but definitely recommended if that's what you're looking for. Besides, it's cheap enough to replace in a year or two if it breaks."
1,???,"I bought the Panasonic Hands-free headset with a panasonic cordless phone, they are offering together. The only problem is this headset don't work with the panasonic phone that i bought...So, WHY they were together??????I felt like a fool."
1,Stopped working in 4 months,The headset worked fine for the first four months but then something happened and I hear a ringing sound and people hear an echo. I called panasonic support and they said there is a 3 month warranty and won't do anything for me. I told their script reading support person I won't be buying panasonic anymore.
1,Worthless out of the box,"Perfectly packaged when received, this headset had great sound to the ears but the microphone gives a weak, muffled output using my Samsung cell phone as well as when tested with another brand of cell phone owned by my son. The cost of shipping is equal to half the price of this disappointing unit, so it is destined for the e-waste bin instead of the hassle of a return."
3,Its Okay not the Best,I chose 3 stars because it fits comfortably but the customers have a hard time hearing me they always say my connection sounds staticky and tell me i need to purchase a new headset.
4,Hands free headset,"First time user of headset, what a life-saver. Very easy to use, can really multi-task. Comfortable, no movement once on, microphone easily adjusts to make voice more distinct and volume controlled."
4,Not a bad headset for the money,"I purchased this headset to replace a Plantronics I had been using for 2 yrs. I've always used a Pantronics. I needed an adaptor cord on the plantronics to fit the 2.5 mm jack and the connector wore out. I purchased this headset based on the reviews. The one glaring thing I noticed is that when you speak, you can not hear yourself in the ear piece. It's like talking with an ear plug in one ear. You only hear yourself out of your free ear. It's distracting. I do not wear the ear piece as snugly over the ear which resolves this. Otherwise, sound quality is good. I have not heard anyone complain about my sound quality on the other end. Overall, for the price you can't go wrong. I don't know why you can't hear yourself in the ear piece. I'm going to continue to use this but when it comes time to replace it, I won't buy another one."
4,Great sound,Sounds great. Have two of them. The plastic strap will break. I fixed it with Duct tape. I also have a large head. Sound quality is first rate. Comfortable to wear.
1,Money down the drain,"I bought this Panasonic headset because I purchased new Panasonic cordless phones. MISTAKE! It broke in less than 2 months. The sound quality was only ok. I've used Plantronics in the past and sound is much better. I was disappointed that I would only get a year or so use from those, but now that is looking pretty good!"
5,Headset Does The Job,I did a great deal of looking for headset compatible. It has worked up to my expectations.
2,Already Useless,"Had the unit three months, already people say I sound like I am under water. Now I have to buy another headset.M Stratton, Iowa"
2,Not for business use,"I actually like this headset. It's lightweight and comfortable. However, I simply cannot use it for conference calls from home. You will sound like you are in a tunnel. My little bluetooth headset from my cell has better fidelity. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks for a better headset."
3,Excellent performance,I am using this one with panasonic head phone. I love this one so well the headset is permanently attached to a cordless set
3,it's fine,This was the (Amazon) recommended heaadset for our new DECT 2-line cordless phone. It's reasonably comfortable and good voice quality though the foam speaker piece is a little large.
2,headset,you get what you pay for. have had complaints re: voice volume & quality. Not nearly as comfortable as other headsets I've used.
4,Works well,"Purchased this headset. I like it much better than the RCA one it replaced. However, I had to return the 1st one because it was defective. The replacement works great. Having hands free while at my desk saves the kink in my neck."
1,Does not work,Used it for 4 months and it doesnt work anymore - no sound is transmitted at all. Did its job while it lasted!
