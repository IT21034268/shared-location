1,"NEVER PURCHASE TELEPHONES ON AMAZON FROM ""CHAS""!!!!!","The telephone I purchased did not work. It was soiled and loaded with the seller's personal information. Neither Panasonic, nor I, could fix this phone. It was advertised as having dual handsets but DID NOT have but one (1). The seller put a message on the invoice that came with the phone stating, ""I couldn't find the other phone"". Very shady, childish, underhanded seller! I sent the phone back to him/her but have heard nothing further. My main reason for purchasing this phone was the dual handsets.With a heavy heart, I purchased some books last week from Amazon but my trust is gone.Margaret Connors"
4,A Nice Phone,"This is a very nice phone to have; though little bit expensive. I have been using this for more than 3 years. When I bought, I paid nearly $240.Pros:The 5.8 GHz frequency is amazing; the quality is very good even when I carry the phone outside my home (Mail box, etc). No interference with other wireless devices.Cons:Shorter battery life; this doesn't last more than 1.5 hours. I work from home a lot; need longer battery life as I need to be on the conference calls few hours a day.When we receive International calls, we don't get all the digits of Caller's Number(they are longer and they get truncated).Speed Dial storage capacity is less. I think it can store up to 50 numbers only.Suggestion for Improvement:When we are on the call, system records the numbers we punch (like Account # or Credit Card #). The system should ignore all the numbers we key in once the call is connected to enhance security."
3,Unable to pickup a panasonic station when a non wireless phone is off hook,"Other than that, we are happy."
3,Why only 4 handsets?,"They advertise you can put in the kids room, the garage, etc...If I'm counting right you won't have any phones left to put in the living room, bedrooms, office, etc...They had 8 with the 2.4 version, what moron decided 4 was the number?"
1,No great leap forward,"see item B0002VMDIY, the TG-6500B, for my comments on the system. In brief, not impressive; have since returned it and purchased the Uniden TRU8866 (item B0002EZUYK), which I'm quite happy with."
3,Fun movie...typical Arnold,"Arnold Schwartzenegger plays Soviet police-captain Vanya Danko, opposite Chicago PD's Art Ritsek (Jim Belushi), tracking down a Soviet drug dealer.The contrast between the old Soviet Union and Chicago are striking. The USSR is clean, organized and oppressive while Chicago is dirty, chaotic and freewheeling. A great visual description of Communism vs. Capitalism.A big letdown to me was when I figured out the handcannon carried by Arnold was a Desert Eagle .50AE pistol. Those things are way overused in Hollywood. It would have been better if they had kept the Soviets with eastern bloc firearms. The laminated SKS rifles being carried by the Red Square honor guard looked cool, and it seemed like all the other Soviet bad guys and cops were carrying Makarovs. The US based bad guys carried a wide variety of firearms.This is a good movie that is typical Arnold. If you like Arnold, you will like this movie. Belushi is an added treat."
4,Arnold Rocks!!!!!,"admit it, sometimes the big guy just picked the right material..in this movie he is perfectly cast as a russian policeman after a drug lord who is on the run in the US.. Jim Belushi is over the top as the Chicago cop assigned to keep Arnold in check...really funny when Belushi calls Arnold ,.....Gumby"
2,not new,The price should have been a tip off that the product was not new even though that was how it was listed. To me new means in the package unopened.
5,Good Movie!,I do remember that I've seen it before on HBO. But never been a own of my DVDs so I did purchased it for my own DVDs. They're a Russian Police & Chicago Police were looking for Russian Suspect in the Chicago crimes. Russian Cop must capture a russian suspect to brought him a trial in the Moscow but He finally killed him is done. He returns his home in Moscow. They're all excellent movie. I love it. Thanks :)
2,Not as good as 1st release,"Don't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like I did. The earlier ARTISAN release is still much better than this special edition. The image is better and ALSO the sound. I don't know what Lions gate thought they were doing, but remastered? no. I compared both several times before writing this even though I only had to compare once. Might as well wait for a HD DVD to come out, this is a waste unless you want the additional features."
4,"Doubts all gone, now that I have watched it.","Read the reviews of the BluRay on two other sites and they weren't very favorable. This is after I had already ordered it from Amazon. It isn't reference quality by any means. There are some soft scenes, and I noticed a few artifacts. But this BluRay is so much better than the non-anamorpic DVD, which was the only version I had. Am really glad it's finally out on BluRay, now if only I could get Raw Deal, Running Man, True Lies, Red Sonja and the Conan the Barbarian movies on BluRay."
4,Awesome 80s Action Flick,"It's a shame they can't do action like this anymore. Sure, its not the most original story, and the actors won't win any Oscars, but it sure is entertaining. The premise is pretty basic: buddy cop movie with a chicago cop and Russian cop (during the cold war era). Arnold is his usual excellent self, and jim belushi is hysterical. The action is top notch, and the story well played (based on a very simple premise). The most important factor: it was really entertaining. There's not a dull moment, and it was enjoyable the whole way through. Overall, I'd say the movie was excellent for action fans, and would highly recommend it."
3,80s buddy cop flick still has its moments...but no classic,"The 80s was the golden era for the buddy cop action flick and Schwarzenegger and Belushi make a pretty decent team in Red Heat.Unfortunately (even by buddy cop standards) the paint-by-numbers, fish-out-of-water story is rather tepid.Some funny moments, some decent action but nothing special.The BD is almost the same as the flick. Serviceable but nothing more, and perhaps not as detailed (DNR maybe?) as it should be."
3,Arnie buddy cop comedy that has its' moments,"With the success that Walter Hill scored with 48 Hours, he returned to the buddy cop formula with Red Heat. Teaming a Russian cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger, dead pan) with a Chicago detective (James Belushi) to track down a killer, the film shines with the interaction between good 'ol Ah-nold and Belushi, even as it gets more and more predictable and ridiculous as the film goes on. Still though, Red Heat is fun if you don't mind the cliches, and for Arnie fans it's worth seeing to see just how dead pan Arnie nails down his role as the humorless Russian cop. The rest of the cast also includes Peter Boyle, a young Laurence Fishburne, and Gina Gershon. This re-released Special Edition from Lion's Gate has a few solid features, but if you already own the previous edition don't feel the need to upgrade."
5,This is a must-have book for traveling to Florida with kids!,"Ms. Brandon takes the guesswork out of vacationing in Florida, with her common sense approach to this book. Information is organized in a user-friendly fashion that makes it easy and fun to include the whole family in the planning process! Her vast knowledge of the subject matter is apparent; she has given clear and concise descriptions of specific attractions throughout Florida, from a perspective rich with personal experience and humor. Indeed, it is an enjoyable book to read, even if a trip to Florida is not on the horizon!"
1,it sucks,This product sucks. It is extremely noisy. It is impossible to hear anything but the dryer motor when it is running. It really sounds like it is going to explode.
2,Very disappointed!,"When my original Hot Tools dryer finally wore out after many, many years of use I wanted to find an exact replacement. This model (1051) looked to be the closest. I was so disappointed when I first used it and found several things that weren't as good as the original.*First of all it is very, very loud!*The bonnet doesn't pack back into the small storage space and must be left half out which is not convenient for storing it*The bonnet also becomes disconnected from the hose while in use occasionally.*The design for the controls for heat are much harder for me to use than in my previous dryer.It seems to me the over all quality of the dryer is much lower than their first models."
2,Left Wanting,"Far too many artist renderings, and though this was about vintage THEATRES AND OPERA HOUSES a particular theater I was looking for in San Francisco - the Orpheum - was completely missing. (Perhaps the building is too exterior-plain to warrant inclusion.) What's really needed is a comprehensive book, mainly of photos, of these fancy older theaters that are still standing and in use, both interior and exterior shots. Otherwise, it was nice to recognize other theaters I've been to, including the Bolshoi and the Maryinski, though another distressing element is how few interior photos are available, and I think the focus is literally on architecture, so they're serious about the title. Mainly there are exterior shots of standing buildings, with less attention paid to interior construction or decor. Accompanying text is included, of course, though i found some theaters with photos had no text to accompany the inclusion."
3,The Gingerbread Man,"The first book was great, the various sequels are pretty much standardized chapters plugged into a semblance of order by some auto-writing computer program. If you want to find out what happens to those happy-go-lucky guys with ginger on their finger, buy this book and the rest of the series. I classify it as good airplane travel reading. Professor Turtledove writes well and I like his ideas, but some of these books are obviously written only as a sequel. The sex is ok but needs to drip and throb a little bit more. Carnage is pretty standard, maybe some more burning acrid flesh needs to be plugged in. None the less, its a good read so buy it and read it and, hey! keep out of those ginger snap cookies we're sending those to the Admiral of the Overlord Fleet."
4,Yamabushi's mini reviews XIX,"Continuing to chronicle an alien invaded WWII earth. In just the second book turtledove numerous plot threads start to slow things down. Where, a chapter about 1 interesting character is followed by 2 you couldn't be the least interested in."
3,too lost in the scandals,Volume 2 is not nearly as good as volume one. The author gets too lost in the sex thing which detracts from the theme of the series.
3,"Enjoyable, but subtly flawed","The book was mostly enjoyable, though did seem to sometimes skip about and dwell on unimportant characters. My main problem with this book was the subplot dealing with Jens/Barbara/Sam. This seems forced and unrealistic. My impression is that Sam would have been in serious trouble for shacking up with someone elses wife. Instead the author wants us to feel that the husband is the bad guy. It just doesn't play out. Sam, you cheating scoundral, I hope you get nuked in the third book. (and don't beg off that you thought the husband was dead. Missing for a couple of months does not a death make.)"
3,"Cool Idea, Poor Execution","After reading the first book in this series I was pretty much hooked. I thought it was a very interesting idea to have invaders from space interrupt WWII. What is most interesting is that the aliens have our current level of technology.However, In the second book I started abridging Mr. Tutrledove's writing pretty brutally. There are so many contributing plots that really don't contribute, and each sub-plot just rehashes the same themes. When I came to the sections with the Russian Pilot Ludmilla, I knew we would hear about how her German mechanic was always trying to get in her pants but he was such a good mechanic she'd put up with it. Every Time. So I'd read the first paragraph and the last in her section. Yawn.Heavy handed abridging was the key to enjoying this series. The idea is fantastic, and I'm still tempted to read further into the colonization series."
1,Couldn't be worse,"The first book in the series was passable, but weak. This was the worst book I have read. For good story telling and better character development read David Weber, C.S. Forester, and David O'brian. I have not stopped reading in the middle of a series, until now."
5,Turtledove's Alternate History and Sci Fi,This book combined alternate history and science fiction. It was very well put together using actual events for the start and included historical figures as they would probably react to the new circumstances.The author describes how common people would have their lives changed by the different chain of events. He is good at describing people and their lives. I really enjoyed the book.
4,"A very enjoyable book, including logical science fiction.","I bought the first book of the saga supposing that I would find a story similar to The Guns of the South. That is, I thought that WWII would be won by the Nazis, in my original view, a much more interesting story than one featuring a invasion from an unknown planet. My initial disappointment, however, was more than compensated for by a nice, enjoyable story, that although pure science fiction, it perfectly makes sense. Maybe the second part is somewhat boring compared with the first book, but it still deserves to be read. To find out how Turtledove will manage to solve the saga continues to be a good reason to read the third and the fourth books."
1,Boring with one dimensional characters,"I read the first of this series and was bored to tears with Harry's long-windedness. For some reason, a few months later, I decided to buy this book to see how the lizards made out.What a mistake. This book is so boring that I just skipped entire chapters to avoid having to read one more narrative about some arrested-development adolescent shooting his gun and thinking with his crotch.The one exception to this is the Jens Larsen character who gets utterly reamed by the author. (Note to Mr. Turtledove: you are not Charles Dickens. When you try things like this, you come across as crass and manipulative. Stick to your standard simplistic and silly descriptions of combat.)The villains in these books have to be the biggest morons in the universe and they have so many vulnerabilities (they can't handle the cold? Geeze!) that defeating them is a challenge only for the twits populating the pages of this book.Stay away. This book is a waste of money."
2,corny science-fiction,"One advantage of this book is that it has a hilarious cover: leaving it on your coffee table will guarantee a hit conversational piece.As for the text itself, it pretty cheesy. It's a time-traveling story about a Black militant and White supremacist who each try to go back in time to change things around in favor of their race. Like any time-travel story, though, there are serious problems with the plot."
2,thoughtful,"Quality Construction, but to stiff. Hard to get phone in and out. I have purchased a previous Cell Case from Amazon that was a Nicole Miller. It was soft leather and approximately same size. I love it. Have never used this one, sits in a drawer. I use Cell cases daily for work as a property manager. On the go constantly and must keep hands free. Cell phone a tool not a fashion statement."
3,Metal clip didn't last....,"The design is nice, unfortunately the metal clip didn't last. I received it in third week of October, it's Dec., 12 (2012) and after using it maybe a handful times the clip fell apart. I really loved it. Without the metal clip the leather strap it's just on the way..."
1,Stopped working after a month of very little use,"Avoid, purchase foredom instead. Before it stopped working altogether, the torque slowed down a bit after the second use. I only use copper so there is no excuse for this to happen."
4,Good Quality and Gets the Job Done,"Very good quality and is second best to the Foredom I use in the metals shop. It operates very quietly but I wish that the rotary had a little bit more variety in speed. Overall, this was a great product for me and I use it in my own metalsmithing studio at home. This price is almost a steal."
4,Nice light!,"We bought this as a replacement to another underwater light whose seals went bad resulting in total failure in less than a year. This Pelican is still going strong and it is BRIGHT! We also use it out of the water because the size, long battery life, and brightness make it very handy. The waterproofing adds to the product -- we can use it in the water (pool, beach or tub) and in the pouring rain without any worries. This is the second Pelican product I've bought and I'm impressed."
2,not great by any stretch of the imagination,"Back when I was considering a move to Holland or Belgium and was immersing myself in the Dutch language, I got my hands on this film, hoping for the best. Generally, I have enjoyed Dutch cinema, so this was actually quite disappointing. It is not that this was a terrible film; the story was actually fairly interesting. A group of busy, very different sisters conspire to sabotage their brother's upcoming nuptials in order to safeguard a family property (he will inherit it if he marries). Having believed for years that the property was safe (because the brother was widely perceived to be gay) the sisters are shocked and band together, despite their very obvious and frequent differences. Overall not a one of the characters here is very likeable, and though I applaud films that take a candid look at real people with real personalities (likeable or not), this one just rubbed me the wrong way. It's watchable but not great by any means."
3,Typical European sex comedy,"Halina Reijn is a wonderful actress, so I bought the film. However this movie genre is not my favorite. I didn't find the movie particularly funny, nor scandalous. I would watch the movie again though."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I don't mind quirky, but I need to feel some sympathy or interest in the characters. Couldn't find that here even by the half way point. Boring movie."
5,One of the landmarks of CGI development...,"This Video represents the work of dozens of PIXAR animators since the early 80s. This is not the best CGI seen now but it shows the development of computer animation through out time and the incredible talent these people possess! Those who love CGI will love this video...though it is linked with Disney, these clips were made long before Disney got involved with PIXAR!"
1,Surprisingly a dud,"Somehow, this tape was defective. Oh, the programming was great, but this particular tape caused my mom's VCR to make strange noises, & my dad's VCR to go kaput, just as I was trying to stop & eject the tape when the program was over. The tape is stuck in the VCR & it won't work anymore. If it's not too much trouble, I'd like my money back please! How can I get a refund if the tape's stuck in a now-kaput VCR? Please answer back ASAP!"
2,Give this one a miss - it's not a good movie,"While the blurb sounded good, unfortunately Clone did not live up to its promise.While the acting was ok, there were a couple of flaws in the script and the movie was very slow going in quite a few places.The only bright light in the movie was the ending, which unfortunately made all of the previous 98% completely useless and a waste of the viewer's time.Spend your money on a better movie."
4,Very Twisting,"This movie had many interesting aspects. Don't watch this unless you are fine with some crazy twists. No, this movie didn't have the production quality of say... Avatar. However, it was very good nonetheless. The ending was... wow! Which leads me to say, yes. I gave this 4 stars, just notched one because of where it fits in my tastes. I will recommend it though."
5,"Great for younger kids, too","I have three children, ages 6, 5 and 2. They love sitting around and having me plunk out these melodies on a keyboard or piano while we learn the lyrics together. It's a great activity for all! I Love this book and that it's getting my kids excited about music at such a young age!"
1,Breaks quickly,After two weeks the first spring broke; a day later the second; repaired with rubber bands as item has no warranty; band repair lasted two months with many band replacements; then the plastic started breaking and now has completely failed and no other repairs are possible - only two months use with us as the repair authority (replacing the springs would have cost several times the unit for S & H). Would have purchased a different one if I had known it was so incredibly wear inferior to minimal play use.
4,A droll fast moving story with little violence or sex. Lot of fun. I couldn't put it down.,This is a fast moving story with a chuckle on every page The protagonists are so human one can relate to them. Set in a university the characters are realistsic with their professorial quirks and insghts onto living.
1,Crap!,Wow this is an extremely low budget movie with bad acting. Just another slasher movie with typical plots. I mean how many times has this type of movie been made with young teenagers drinking and doing drugs with a maniac killer after them. Don't waste your time.
2,Just another low budget slasher film,"Just another low budget slasher film, there is some decent actors that help carry the film but each and every moment is totally predictable. Naked girl in shower (Nice full frontal) of course she's going to die. Short cut through woods, no good can ever come from that. The flash backs are a bit annoying and the sound is badly regulated, background noise overwhelms the dialog most of the time.If you're just looking for a B-Rated slasher film, this one's for you and there is enough T&A; to keep the guys interested."
3,Much Better,I found this work to be much better written than BANGKOK BABYLON as well as very informative. The author's prejudices become obvious at times but I guess if it's his book he can say what he thinks. Reading THAILAND CONFIDENTIAL would be helpful to anyone planning a visit to Thailand for the first time.
2,"Well written, in a pessimistic baby boomer sort of way.","You can learn something from everyone, and Jerry Hopkins is no exception. Reading his book, helped me move into my mindset for a trip to Thailand, without me realizing it. Thailand is a place of contradiction, like the US, like the Buddha, like people's internal struggle. This book, along with several others, helped me to go to that place, in an honest way, and be myself, and respect those that were being themselves. At the same time, it helped me to keep up a background of vigilance, in the sense, that people are always looking out for themselves, no matter where you go, and it's good to know the rules of a culture that you have never visited. It offered me the freedom to be me, an American, to be me, respectful, to be me, curious, and it was one of the books I read before going to Thailand.Sincerley,T (tgsnydermd@yahoo.com)PS: I tore the cover off of the book, because it was a little creepy in an 80s sort of way."
4,Cracker barrel musings on Thailand.,"In his introduction Jerry Hopkins describes himself as a Grumpy Old Expat, and at times reading this book is a lot like sitting next to an aged uncle at a wedding, listening to gravely pronouncements of what's wrong with the world and who's responsible. But there's also some gentle humor and some sharp observations and the tone overall is one of steady, cool detachment. No extremes, no heady flights of imagination, no rants, no raves, no prose poetry. Just a steady flow of information in a calm, confident, slightly bemused voice. Sometimes the author crosses the line into pedantry, and lectures his reader. But in much larger measure ""Thailand Confidential"" is a thoughtful, gentle, and ultimately charming collection of meditations. It would be a good choice for somebody making their first trip to Thailand and looking for something to read on the plane."
5,Beats monster cable outright!!,"This cable is awsome before buying this i have use several monster cables to hook up my bass cabs but they always go out after a few months they have an unlimited warranty, but for what you pay for monster brand products they should last. This is the custom planet waves cable for the same price as the standard monster cable these are STOUT they have great strain relief and crazy thick sheilding don't look anywhaere else planet waves rocks!!"
4,book: Does the World Need the Jews,"Not Gordis' very best book, but important and timely just the same. Worth being in your library."
3,Baby Mammoth - Bridging Two Worlds,"A marked improvement over 10,000 Years Beneath the Street, Bridging Two Worlds shows a more mature sound for Baby Mammoth. Song development is less on an issue this time around, although some of the tunes don't have the complexity that would shoot them into the stratosphere. Not all, though: ""Slipping Jigsaws"" is a lazy-eyed journey that takes some interesting turns. ""Moonburn"" has a sax sample atop easygoing synth chords and a shuffling beat. And the final track, ""Crack Phase One,"" is a delicious ambient snippet. Worth looking into!"
1,waste of money,"The only thing I agree with is the title, this book is a completely useless piece of ****!! all the parodies and jokes made no sense to me, thank god I didn't buy it instead borrowed it from a friend and he too says it was a complete waste of time and money.."
1,"Not a reference book, has some humor","If you are looking for reference material on Star Trek, this is not the book for you. It has a few funny points and was enjoyable to read."
4,"Quite funny, if not for uber-fanboys","You need to know the series fairly well to get some of the jokes, and the humor and many references are decidedly British, but I had a lot of fun with this book.Some folk who take Star Trek a mite too seriously take offense to this book, so if you have no stomach for a) irreverence and b) the Brits, you might not enjoy this.Otherwise, I found it a gentle jab at the ""revered science fiction cash cow"" we've come to love (until Voyager)."
3,Groan!!!,"I know the basic premise of this book was good, that God can take all things difficult and painful and work them together for good BUT the first two hundred pages of the book were of spoiled, obnoxious relatives, it was very tedious to read it over and over as Dale perfectly submitted to the trial. I guess it is definitely a matter of taste because I loved the Gold Shoe, while some disliked it for the obnoxious relative that came to stay, I found that book delightful and skillfully woven with the Mother's growth as she sought the Lord in it. This book is like a long drawn out dose of castor oil!!"
2,Christmas Carol,This version was obviously made for early television. It does not even compare to other copies such as with Alister Sims or George C Scott.
3,Just as I remembered from 1954,"Okay, I was 4 1/2 years old in Dec 1954, but, some of the scenes are as I remembered them. I believe that it was b-cast twice, same cast, in 1954 and 1955. This video may be a compilation of available sources. It's a musical, but, only a few songs. Well worth it to catch a view of Frederic March on TV. One thing I don't recall, are the long, silent pauses, of the camera just focusing on the actors movements and expressions. Really, it could probably have been done in 30 min instead of 60. Still, worth adding to a home DVD library."
2,"Oh, Brother!","I'm glad I only payed $2.00 for this one. The overblown musical number from Scrooge's past was so unexpected that I laughed out loud. And then to immediately follow this happy, joyful ""love song"" with the break-up just didn't work. At least it isn't as bad as the Reginald Owen or Patrick Stewart versions."
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","Being something of a fan of this tale, I like to collect different versions of it. Of course, at this point, I have most of the better or more well known versions. This year, I thought I'd give this one a try. I did enjoy it, it wasn't terrible. But nor is it a particularly memorable take on the story. It does its job, it entertains, and it is probable that I shall watch it again at some point. But I'd likely recommend it only to the, ""A Christmas Carol,"" adaptation completionists."
2,Hacked up for 1950s TV,"If you've seen all the other Christmas Carol adaptations, you might find this one interesting for its contrast to the others.I found the plot chopped up to allow time for the choral numbers and for Fred March to needlessly emote. For example, there's no Marley door knocker and no ghost of Christmas future to speak of.On the plus side, it reminded me a lot of the TV specials of the late '50s and early '60s - I half expected Fess Parker to appear at any moment. Also, the video quality was pretty good, though the audio was a bit muddy throughout.All things considered, not so good."
1,A Christmas Carol Gone Wrong,"Through the years I have been collecting the many versions of ""A Christmas Carol"". It has become my favorite holiday movie. When I ordered the Fredric March version, I was unaware that it is a musical adoption. I hate musicals. So needless to say it was a hugh disappointment to me.The basis of this wonderful classic was truly lost through song.Could you imagine ""It's A Wonderful Life"" being told this way? I wasn't able to get through even half of it. I'ts in a landfill now...right where it belongs."
1,A Christmas Carol,I have been looking for the move A Christmas Carol that I saw when I was a young girl. I do not know who played in it. All I know is that Scrooge was a little skinny man who went to bed with his nightcap on and nightgown on. I cannot find that movie. Disapointed.
1,IMO,IMO not so good. I love Fredric March but he does not do Scrooge any justice. Could not even finish watching the movie.
1,Worst version ever!,I have over a dozen different versions of this movie and this is by far the worst I have ever seen --- I even turned it off after 20 minutes. The acting is terrible (and these are professional actors.)and the script doesn't match the Dickens story either.Not worth buying --- I'd rather watch the The Muppets or Mr. Magoo.
2,Disappointed in the content,"This version of ""The Christmas Carol"" did not show some of the original scenes. Example: Excluded the part when Scrooge comes home and looks at the door knocker and sees Marley's ghost. This was not in there. Seems like they left out scenes from what it orignally was supposed to be. The price was right but overall disappointed."
1,Awful!,"I bought this because my husband thought it was a different version. We love the story, but this version is terrible. It was made for television a long time ago. Lots of old-fashioned singing instead of dialog. Parts of the stories were also left out. Do not waste your money. It is truly awful."
1,To paraphrase an old saying...,"This is not a DVD to be tossed aside lightly, it should be thrown with great force! The fact that this was an early TV presentation does not excuse the terrible adaptation of a Classic Christmas tale, nor the wooden performances of the actors despite that fact that two of the great ones are represented here. Dickens must be spinning in his grave."
1,BGarlock,"I have been purchasing variations of this movie for the past few years and have enjoyed the other two that I have purchased. I am terrible with remembering the names of actors so can not give names of actors but can only say that the other two were older versions. I was very disappointed with this version and would only recommend it to someone for the sake of allowing someone to see for themselves just how much it could have been improved upon. The musical portion where one of the ghosts sing ""Merry Fairy"" was to say the least laughable and rediculous but at least it did serve the purpose of some comic relief."
5,Great old Flick,Great old Flick the old black and whites are the best scrooges the old special effects are great considering time period and the story is more traditional and not all modernized and wrong
2,Poor Quality,"I received this DVD in good time and fine, unused condition. However, the quality of the film itself is very poor.I do not recommend purchasing this product."
2,Christmas Carol with Fredric March and Basil Rathbone,As much as I respected Fredric March and Basil Rathbone their names was why I bought the movie. This cinemintography was not what this age has come to expect and therefore we were not pleased with the CD at all. Very disappointed.
1,musical,I thought with Basil Rathbone & Fredrick March the movie would be outstanding but who ever put these 2 guys in a musical just wasn't thinking also they did not follow the story line that well. VERY DISAPPOINTED
2,Disappointing,"As a fan and collector of versions of A Christmas Carol, I was very disappointed. I did not realize that it was a musical version nor was it plain just what year the version was made. I may never watch this version again!"
3,so so,"This is a television program probably shot on video tape. The technical quality is surprisingly good for being over fifty years old.They had to cut out many of my favorite portions to make it fit in 30 minutes of story with the 20 minutes of singing solos and duets to make a total of 50 minutes. Most dramatizations are 60-90 minutes long without any singing interludes. One example of things cut out is the late partner's face on the front door where the knocker usually was. Another is the dressing gown hung on the wall and looking like it was occupied.This is a US television production and lacks the ""Britishness"" of the original book and British dramatizations of the book.All in all well worth the time to watch it once, but it may not stand the test of time for you if you have some of the British productions on DVD."
1,Very disappointing!,"First issue is, the description didn't say it was a musical. I love musicals, but this was very bad, singing was beautiful, but it took away from the storyline and left little time to tell the story in one hour. In the interest of being concise, the singing should have been eliminated because so much of the Christmas Carol scenes, which to me were essential to really understand the transformation of Scrooge, were gone. Basil Rathbone was a great actor and one of my favorites, but his talent was wasted here, anyone could have done his Marley. Scrooge was OK, but at times when he would give that crazy grin confused me and seemed inappropriate. I fast forwarded through the singing of Belle and Ebenezer and decided this would be the only time I watched this version of one of my favorite Christmas stories."
2,A christmas Carol With Fredrick March,"It wasn't what I was expecting. A little too old for my taste, but over all not too bad for the money."
2,A so so flick,I am not a fan of movies containing a lot of music or singing. I purchased this to add to my collection of Dicken's flicks. I prefer the other versions available.
2,Not my favorite version,"This is not a very good version of the Dickens classic. I had not seen it and now I know why. I am sure there are some people who might find it entertaining. I,however, am not one of them."
3,A Christmas Carol,"Not one of the best versions of A Christmas Carol. It was OK, but Scrooge seemed to be missing something."
3,movie,I bought this movie because we are fans of A Christmas Carol and own all versions that we find.
5,Best telling of The Mitten that our family has come across,"This version is told with more charm and wit than the Jan Brett re-telling of this tall tale. And the simple drawing style is a good match for the words, keeping the focus on the story rather than distracting with elaborate detail."
4,good to teach compare with other versions of the mitten,I do like Jan Bretts' version better. I used the book to compare with jann Bretts version. Used venn diagram with my preschool class. they enjoyed comparing the two stories.
5,book a must for kids,"This book is so great I had a old copy that was my moms when she was litle then mine, so I bought a new one for my daughter it is GREAT, very interesting and good for the imagimation. However there were some coffe stains in the book when the seller listed it as new."
5,Cook Book or Art Book,"Reading Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook is almost like taking a trip to this exceptional restaurant. The photographs and commemorative menus are stunning and the recipes are terrific, but it is the warm, generous personality of the staff, particularly Michael Wild that are expressed in the text that impresses me most of all. You'll want to share this treasure."
2,Battery doesn't charge in camera,"The photo on the product shows an original Sony Battery. I paid the high price for this item because I didn't want any hassles with 3rd party batteries. Nothing on the order page indicates it is a 3rd party battery. The battery I received is a 3rd party battery and will not charge in the camera. It does work in the camera, so I'm just going to buy a cheap charger and use that. The product shown here is not the one you will receive. Just buy a cheaper 3rd party battery and you'll be better off than getting one from this deceptive page."
1,This was not the best intro text for Oracle,"I was reviewing Oracle texts for a high-school database class, and I had the misfortune to stumble upon this text. A more appropriate title might be ""Oracle8i by Dummies"".The author clearly does not work much with Oracle, and much is the material has been grossly distorted or just plain wrong. There are many other intro Oracle books that are far more complete. This one was a huge disappointment."
2,A disappointment,"I have not read most of the book, but the first couple chapters were not helpful in the task of creating a very simple database within an hour or two, which is what I was looking for. If you are in a big hurry, Oracle8 Bible, by Carol McCullough-Dieter, might be a better choice for someone with no familiarity with Oracle."
1,avoid this book,"The sample code in the book has typos, the website that is printed for additional help is useless, the sample code downloaded to create the sample database gives an error."
5,Jewish Renewal: How religion and sprituality link to LIFE,"Rabbi Waskow provides historical insite and warmth to a newer vision of Judaism. His door is open as is his heart to include everyone, including zealots who often disagree with Waskow's 21st century vision of revived Jewish study and 16th century rabbinic interpretations of Torah. He breathes new life into ancient traditions and ritual. Not a favorite with Rightwing Jews or Christians....."
5,not much to add - except re-release is out soon,"A re-release of the set is due out June 8th, 2010J.S. Bach: Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 1 - 6- Hybrid sacd and cd that will play on any working cd player"
5,Should Be Read By All,"This book sits on my coffee table in the living room. I draw from Mr. Berry's philosophy and writings almost daily. This book should be required reading in colleges and universities. It speaks of the sensibilities most of us have forgotten. I have loaned my copy to many friends, all have read it, it has changed the way they approach their lives and how they look at how we all live."
3,A Bit Too Snarky For My Taste,"I was quite disappointed. I'm glad Wendell Berry has created a nice life for himself, but somehow the essays made me feel inept and something-or-other, likeunworthy? He obviously doesn't abide fools gladly, and maybe not even half-fools like the rest of us."
4,Good product,I have used Lobob cleaner for decades at the recommendation of my original opthamalogist. I find it's quality has been consistent even though local supply has not. I was pleased to find it available online.
5,Excellent Cleaner,I purchased this cleaner for my contacts. I still use gas perm lens and it is the best product on the market.
4,works well,"There are not many options when buying products for hard contact lenses. This one works well enough, but comes out a bit fast so you get much more than you need from one squirt."
5,Lobob,Great product - cleans wonderfully and removes protien buildup. Have used this for many years and it is still the best cleaner on the market. Have tried many others but I always resort back to this one.
5,Great stuff,"All of the Lobob Optimum products are great. I've been wearing gas permeable lenses for a long time, and the cleaner they are the more comfortable they are.This cleaner is the best I've used, and I've tried them all. When combined with their other products you may rethink switching to soft lenses or getting surgery."
4,classic spy story,"Josef Vadassy is a Hungarian refugee living in France earning a living as a language teacher.While on holiday on the Riviera he innocently takes a roll of film of his holiday into be developed and as a result he is arrested as a Gestapo Agent.What follows is an intriguing tale of espionage with Josef trying to uncover the real spy prior to his world being destroyed.It's very Agatha Christie in that it has a cast of characters all in one place at one time with the spy being one of them. There the comparison ends, its very well written and the tension is continually built. This is Ambler at his peak."
4,Ambler is Evergreen,"I have seen many old movies based on Ambler books but for some reason, despite my interest in espionage fiction, never read him. You'd think given its pre-war vintage that the book might be creaky and dated. It is as fresh and intriguing a read as if it had been written yesterday. The characters are great, the flawd, scared but redoubtable protagonist carries the plot forward powerfully and the assortment of pre-ww2 character stypes, although understandably a little sepia-tinted with time, are terrific.A great read. Ambler proves why he was leader of the pack and why so many writers who came after him strived to learn the tricks of the trade from him,"
3,Not Your Normal Vacation,"Imagine scrimping and saving for that special vacation. Someplace you have always wanted to go. You arrive and things are splenid, that is until suddenly you are arrested for being a spy. Thats the case here, and to make matters worse, your told you can't leave the country unless you help in finding the real spy and if you refuse then it's off to jail.Josef Vadassy is the main character in this book. A language teacher who gets arrested in France and is arrested for a crime he hasn't committed.This was a good book with many twists and turns. You find yourself laughing at some of the situations that Vadassy finds himself in and feeling sorry for him at the same time.Though this is an older book,it sort of reminds you of an old movie or radio program.If you are looking for something light hearted then I highly recommend this book."
2,Alas.,"I'm both a Groucho fan and a mystery reader, so this book just had to be good--right? Wrong. It is filled with a great many Groucho-like wisecracks, but the ambience of Hollywood and the story fell too far short to make this worthwhile reading. The plot and characters were just a wee bit hard to follow, and I ended up not caring much one way or another who dunnit. Readers who like the Marx Brothers and mysteries would be better served by Stuart Kaminsky's ""You Bet Your Life."""
4,A Candidate for Mystery on PBS,This is one of those books that you wish had been written back when Groucho could have played the lead himself or that some enterprising person working for Mystery (on PBS) would turn into one of their series as a change of pace from their more serious fare.
4,One day I shot a gangster in my pajamas...,"...how he got into my pajamas I'll never know. This is a short, sweet book, under 300 pages, and the main appeal has to be the idea of Groucho Marx solving a mystery. To add a touch of poignancy, the murder seems to be modeled after the death of Thelma Todd (an actress who died in a similar manner to this novel's victim, not to mention a Groucho co-star). Goulart writes despicable villains and likable heroes. I wouldn't mind reading another of Groucho's case files."
5,A Fun Read,I loved this book and hope to eventually see more Groucho Marx/Master Detective stories. From page one you find yourself swept up in the story and characters and wish the book lasted even longer. Especially fun for fans of Groucho Marx and the Golden Age of Hollywood. Highly recommended!
2,DISAPPOINTED,It would have been nice to see someone else besides Fiona Bruce in her unflattering outfits walking by herself down all those long corridors.
2,Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout,"Nothing new here: muddler type flies catch fish as do traditional hair and feather wing streamers. Put a mallard wing on a Muddler and call it a 'Zoo Cougar'.The patterns section is dissapointing. Bow Buggers,Cone Head Marabous, and a few crawfish patterns are about all that is here. The technique section is OK, but misses out on the truly new streamer methods being used in the West. Probably applies to the authors home waters in the east better than the Rockies. If you fish streamers a bit you should already know 90% of what is in this book."
3,Read it on the beach,"Easy reading, light weight, inoffensive. I read this book while on a pack trip in the Sierras and did not regret taking it along. However, the suspect Dr. Crone was never credible. The plot twist (there is only one) is not very satisfying or believable. Like others, I still cannot figure out how he came up with the title. I suppose the publisher pulled the name out of a hat looking to make a set with the other Martini books. If you don't expect a lot you will not be disappointed."
3,Why audiobooks are abridged!,This audiobook is a great 4 hour mindless bit of candy. Steve doesn't pretend to be a great wordsmith. He only gives us a decent fast-paced legal thriller with a character we like and a mildly spooky and mysterious plot line. It zaps you with a surprise ending. Do you need to listen to every word to get the essence of the audiobook? No. You unabridged purists would do well to adjust your attitude and enjoy the show! You could listen to more stuff by-the-way!!
1,...,"Mr. Martini owes me .... This book didn't make any sense at all. I have read and enjoyed all of his books until this bomb. The only interesting thing about the book was why he would title it ""The Jury"" when he only mentions the jury a couple of times. He must have been bored and needed some money because his heart wasn't into it."
2,BORING!,"I have read many of Martini's books and really like the ""can't put it down"" style along with them usually being quick reads. I never really got into this book, even though I finished it (and I don't know why I bothered). It was boring!"
4,Chris Noth as Madriani,"I have always loved Martini's Madriani character. I was looking forward to reading The Jury and was very pleased by it. Although I have a bit of a problem with the title (the Jury wasn't a big part of the book) Martini can tell a courtroom story with the best of them. Of course, the fact that my favorite actor Chris Noth portrayed Madriani in a recent TV mini series just increased my love for this character.A must read if you are a fan of the legal thriller."
2,Leigh,"I am a Martini fan and have enjoyed his previous books, but this one is not up to his usual standards. First of all, the title is very misleading. The jury had no impact on this book at all. Secondly, there were a lot of loose ends and missing details. It's the details that usually make the Martini books most interesting. Were he did put the details, such as with the testimony of the expert witness, it was boring. Although I finished the book, I didn't really enjoy it."
3,Ok story; Don't read it because of the title,"Far from the best from Martini. Why it is called ""The Jury"" is certainly questionable. I have some thoughts, but that might give away the ending which was good and unpredictable. The story of Dr. Crone was slow and tiresome. The trial wasn't particularly interesting either."
5,Worthy of O'Henry,"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I work hard to provide unexpected plot twists at the end of my mysteries. Steve Martini certainly provides a brilliant final twist to his plot in THE JURY. THE JURY is Mr. Martini's latest legal thriller featuring Paul Mandriani. The San Francisco attorney has relocated to the other spectacular California waterfront metropolis--San Diego (America's Finest City, by its own admission). Mandriani is tasked with defending Dr. David Crone, a medical researcher involved in cutting edge human genome mapping. Kalista Jordan, a fellow researcher, is murdered. She was a professional rival, and Crone becomes the prime suspect. A suicide and confession changes things unexpectedly, and then comes the ultimate O'Henry twist. THE JURY is a terrific book."
2,Short and sweet,"I was excited to discover another ""Madriani"" book was coming out from Steve Martini. But when I got the book, I was a little surprised to see it was only about 290 pages long. After the murder occurs at the beginning, the book jumps right into the trial. The trial was slightly interesting, but overall I really didn't find any new characters that I liked or that held my interest. The resolution was uninspired, and near the ending, the book got downright silly.I expected better from Steve Martini."
3,You won't deliberate long over this one,"If you're looking for a good fix on a cross-country airplane flight this book will just barely tide you over. The Courtroom dialog is exciting and well-written. The rest of the book, however, is difficult to believe and the final plot twist is too silly to take seriously.From a technology perspective, Martini does get into an interesting area of science, but he never develops it.It's not that this is a bad read, it's just that it's not a great read."
2,Why is it called The Jury?????????????,Someone explain to me why it is called The Jury. I looked at the cover and wondered if my book's insides had been exchanged leaving the title? I can't see a connection. This book is a too-drawn-out legal story that really drags in the last fourth.
2,Fool me once...,"Shame on you. Fool me about 100 times shame on me. Guess I should have seen the 3 and half star reviews before me. A 3.5 on a best seller like Martini usually means no better than 2 which is right on. I buy these can't miss bestsellers, then read the dreck, figure out the ending after 50 pages or so and wait for the next one to buy. I'm an idiot. Long live Richard Russo and John Irving."
3,Entertaining but way too long,"This was a fun novel overall, mainly because I love the dry wit and comaraderie between Madriani and Harry. The plot was pretty easy to guess from about 1/3 through the book, from motive to the actual murderer. There was a lot introduced that never amounted to anything at the end (the disposal of Jordan's body, the mother's shocking testimony), serving only as detours that go nowhere. A lot of ""physical evidence"" was never explained either, and forgotten by the end of the book. There is one particularly dreadful chapter about nylon ties that will cause even the most helpful Ace hardwareman to fall asleep. A fun and quick read, but don't get too hung up in the details, Martini sure didn't."
2,The Jury's Verdict? Not guilty of legal thrills,"If this had been my first Martini book, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, but given the Martini standard, this falls far short. The title has no relevance, other than it gives the book buyer the illusion that the jury itself holds significance to the story, as the attorney the judge did in earlier books. But rest assured, the jury makes no impact on this story. We never even learn who they are. The motivation of the killer was weak, and the action was tenuous in this entry to the Madriani series. I never understood about the mystery van - it followed our hero, but why? All in all, it was a quick read, and evidently, too quick of a write for Martini."
2,a cell out,the title amounts to false advertising of a pallid tale that gets bogged down in pseudo-science. a minor effort by an author usually known for his uniquely outlandish imagery and irreverent wit. a very talented writer of legal fiction seems to have succumbed to rank commercial packaging. his loyal fans are in for a disappointment.
3,3 1/2 stars,"This time around Paul Madriani and Harry Hinds are defending Dr. David Crone, a research scientist accused of murdering a young African-American colleague named Kalista Jordan. The evidence points strongly at Dr. Crone. Was it racial? Did it have to do with the highly secretive genetic research Dr. Crone was working on? Or was it a combination of both; Racial genetics?Madriani and Hinds do what they can in this rather lackluster effort by Steve Martini. A fairly slow-paced, very average legal novel like this is not what I expected from Martini. This was a dry Martini. It also seems to me that the title was chosen before the book was written. The Jury???A good story thats just not up to Martini specsInside the covers:~A scientist goes where science takes himRecommendation: The Library"
2,"Disappointed, as well","Having read and enjoyed all of Martini's earlier efforts, I have to say, this one let me down. The plot is boring and predictable, there is no real interaction between the characters, and absolutely no subplot to maintain interest. As has been mentioned earlier, there is also no ""Jury"".I had been looking forward to this one, and noticed that the release date was delayed several times. Now I see why. It seems time to give this character a rest."
3,Incomplete,"A good story but some facts aren't explained, a genetics physician is accused of killing an associate professor, a brilliant younger black attractive lady, Paul Madriani, Steve Martini's alter ego I assume is the lead player in this story along with his faithful companion Harry Hinds. The courtroom action or rather inaction at times is really hard not just scan over and go on to a more interesting part something like beating a dead horse, its hard to be critical without revealing too many spoilers, another good novel from Mr. Martini but far from his best."
3,The Verdict Is In - 3 stars,"I have usually enjoyed the Paul Madriani character and the cases he gets involved in. Somehow this particular story kind of mills around without much energy and has some trouble keeping the reader's interest. No one ever represented anyone charged with murder that was clearly more guilty, so you know he is innocent. After that you wait for the onion to get peeled down to the answer. There is not enough courtroom action here and one learns a bit more about genetics than we really want to. This isn't a bad book. Just not up to his usual standard...which is wha the verdict from ""this jury of one"" at least is three stars."
3,Disappointed,"I have read all of martini's books and enjoyed all of them. This one left me waiting for something to happen. The title, ""The Jury"", oh well, where did that come from. The books was indeed about a murder trial, but the jury was definitely NOT in the plot. they never appeared except to enter and leave the jury box maybe twice in the whole book. It was short, predictable and not worth the money. will be careful before I purchase another one of his."
3,Another slow one for Martini,"What happened to the first 150 pages. Martini tells you 3 times who the killer is. Just like his last book, the killer is given away in the first 30 pages. I thought I got a book that had lost the first 150 pages. It's listed at 448 pages, and it comes out with 291. One must wonder if Martini has gotten bored with the Madriani character."
2,Potentially great video ruined by annoying soundtrack.,"The dogs in this video are WONDERFUL, but the editing ruined the experience for me. Much of the video has the original audio removed and replaced with incredibly annoying, pounding music that just wore me out after the first few minutes. The segments that do include the original audio were actually enjoyable (in spite of the still overpowering soundtrack). Being able to hear the audience responding, clapping, dogs barking, etc allowed you to feel the REAL energy at the event. Removing it robs you of that experience and, at least for me, made it feel unnatural and extremely fatiguing to watch. I ended up MAYBE watching 15 minutes, forwarding through most of the two discs."
2,Not the product inside the box,"The image makes it look and sound like an all stainless steel scale, but it is not.Only the top is stainless, the rest is black plastic (not even the grey look in the image).Scale works fine so far, I'm keeping it.Amazon wants me to fill out a second report in order to investigate the complaint.They sent this review request a second time after I informed them of the problem.Amazon is making me do repetitive work and wasting my time.Order it, open it, feel the disappointment, move on."
1,Do not support warranty,"My Weigh does not support the warranty for their scales... very disappointing..I will not be buying another of this brand,"
3,"WARNING! 2nd movie is actually ""Reaching For the Moon""","Due to error by Family Value the second movie here is actually ""Reaching For the Moon"" (1930) with Douglas Fairbanks of Robin hood fame. One of only 5 talkies he did at the pinacle of his career. Its actually the better of the 2 movies and the actual transfer runs 6 minutes longer than the typical 65 minutes! There are no beginning titles though! The plot is outstanding: Wall Street wizard, Larry Day (Fairbanks), is a financial genius but an incompetent with women. Entranced with a beautiful young woman, he takes lessons from his valet on the subject of womanizing, then follows her on an ocean voyage, where cocktails, laced with a ""love potion,"" work their magic. He then loses his fortune in the market crash, and feels he has also lost his girl. The young lady, however, is not blind to the fine young man inside the awkward exterior."
4,"steady throughout, but very suspenseful at the end","This was the first book i read on my kindle thanks to a girl friend of mine that recommneded it. I thought at times the story line jumped around a bit making it choppy but overral it was an easy and enjoyable read. Once I got about half way through I couldn't put it down, wish it didn't so abrubtly but i would definitely recommend it to others!"
3,The best laid plans.....,"After a very sobering stint in prison, Jamal Stewart has vowed never to return. It is his mission to find legitimate employment, and shy away from the lifestyle that landed him in prison. When he meets up with his old friend Dawg, his resolve is severly tested. Will the lure of fast money, fancy homes and expensive cars be too strong for Jamal to resist?In ENTANGLED, author K. Elliott gives a very detailed description of a day in the life of a drug dealer - the highs, the lows, the consequences and the repercussions. I found this to be a good book and would recommend to those who enjoy the urban ""street life"" genre.Reviewed by Renee Williamsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,Entangled,"This was my first book by this author, it was an interesting read. It gave you a lil of everything that goes on in the street."
3,Unbelievable,I can honestly say I've learned a great deal from this unbelievable book. My judgement on things are totally different now.
4,I am not a BIG reader,"I amm not a big reader but once I got into the characters, I couldn't put it down. I just got the other two in the series. You won't be disappointed."
2,All over the place,The concept is good but the book was all over the place. There were no gradual transitions...It jumps from one scene to the next on the same page. Extremely confusing!
3,Entangled,"This book had to many things going on at once, characters jumping infrom left field. And the writing was kind of on the down side, but loved the ending.Overall i was a bit disappointed!!! But i do love K. Ellotts books"
5,Wow!,From the first Chapter I was hooked! I felt like I was in a movie. The characters in the book captures your heart even when you try your hardest not to like them. It's full of suspense. After Chapter 3 forget trying to put this book down. I loved it! It makes you think about things in life in a new perspective. It definitely brings reality far too close to home!
3,Mediocre,"I liked the book...although i've read better. It seemed to lack excitement all the way to the end. I would suggest reading Tru to the game by: Terri Woods instead. it has a better storyline, characters, and more suspense."
1,hated it...so unreal it was laughable,"OMG whoever told this author they had a gift of writing urban lit was a total liar. I hated this book. As a matter of fact, I removed it from my device. I'm a fan of Urban Literature and this was a major dissappointment. If I could give it a half star, I would."
5,ENTANGLED,I went to a hair show in Atlanta back in February and saw Mr. Elliott and a few other brothers selling the book so I decided to support a brother and buy it I just got around to reading the book and I just couldn't put the book down!! I loved the book it hit so very close to home that it made me sit down and think. I hardly ever read books but this is one that everyone has to read expecially us black women I gave the book to my best friend and she hasen't put it down yet either. Mr. Elliott thank you for keeping my attention and thank you for opening my eyes even though this book my be a fiction story it really hits home...To anyone that haven't read this book take my word for it YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!
4,MRS COX,IT WAS NOT MY BEST STORY BUT IT WAS A GREAT STORY! I'M WONDERING IF THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK THE AUTHOR PUT OUT. IF SO I HAVE REASON TO BELEV THAT BY NOW I BET THE THE AUTHORS HAS GROWN AS A WRITER AND THEIR WORK IS BETTER THEN BEFORE. I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT ELSE K.ELLIOTT HAS OUT. GOOD JOB
2,Thought It Would Be Better!,"First let me say that I am a reader, who likes to read different authors, subjects, all types of books. After reading these reviews, I thought the book would blow me away. Needless to say, I didn't not enjoy the book. The book wasn't poorly written, but the plot was on a below average level. I was disappointed at the main characters stupidity and how the leading male was more focused on himself. I am not thrilled that I even spent $0.99 on this book, as it was not worth the change. So disappointed!"
4,NEVER OUT OF STYLE,"For me, a classic is something of which I never tire. That's surely the case with this men's cologne.Kouros, the classic figure of a Greek youth, in all probability an athlete, is an apt name for this scent from Saint Laurent. It's vigorous, dynamic and free-spirited. A combination of a woodsy fragrance and spicy notes make it popular - a man's cologne with scent-appeal.The container is trim, rather stately, reminiscent of a Greek column"
3,Not worth $20.00,"The Calphalon Stainless-Steel 4-Piece Measuring Cup Set is very heavy and the handle is long but the handle doesn't look like it's securely attached. Also, Calphalon felt the need to make their name 4 times as large as the engraved measurement. Since both are on the handle, this means the first thing you see is Calphalon and after you look closer, you'll see the size of the scoop. (Personally, I would like to have seen it the other way around.)"
2,"""Needed Much More Conflict""","This book started off with promise as the Pernese dolphins rescue Alemi and his nephew, Readis, from a wild storm at sea. And I did like how a handful of humans tried to re-establish relations with the marine mammals. Interesting to see the dolphins butcher the English language, which led to some problems of understanding between the two species. But then the story ground to a halt. Everything went swimmingly between man and dolphin and there was hardly any conflict I could see. The efforts to stop Thread just got breezed over, and the problem Readis' mother had with him communicating with dolphins could have been expanded on a lot more. To be honest, I did not even get to the end of the book. I just couldn't see any goals that needed to be achieved or conflicts that needed to be resolved and did not see the need to continue on to the end."
2,An Editing Nightmare,"I have always loved reading Anne McCaffrey's work, and I'm sure, had I purchased the book it would have also been a good read. But the Kindle version of this book is absolutely BAD!! Whoever edited this book needs to find another vocation. There are mis-spellings galore, and I suspect portions of the book are clearly missing, as the storyline jumps in places that make no sense whatsoever.Too bad, as my husband bought me a Kindle Fire for my birthday, and while I like the device, several of the books I have read on it have the same poor editing to some degree.Step up your game Amazon!!"
1,"wow, what ...","This book was a bore. A lot of things happen oh so convientently on Pern, but this really takes the cake. All the people have to do is ring the bell and suddenly all the dolphins pop up and talk? And speak intelligable English? And NO one ever tried this before? Despite all the references to dolphin rescues? And don't even get me started on the incredulous population who deny the talking dolphins even after hearing the damn things talk.The conflict between Readis and Armina was identical to the conflict between Robinton and Petiron, Menolly and Yanus and Debera and her dad... not to mention Sean and his father. Child wants one thing, parents want the other blah blah blah. This went no where ands it didn't even get there very fast."
3,Not up to McCaffrey's standards,"After reading the other Pern-books, I felt let down by this one. The overall plot was good, but there were just too many questions left unanswered to my liking, and it was far to longwinded at some parts. The idea of the dolphins was overall fantastic, but the way it was presented was not.I'm waiting for a sequel of ""what happened next"", in hopefully a little more capturing style. And if you haven't read other McCaffrey's books, this is NOT the one you should start with."
3,not much about dolphins,The first portion of the book is about the recontact between the humans & the dolphins of Pern. However soon it becomes a place to put stray stories about Pern at this time period that weren't used in other books. It reminded me of one of those movies that people see only to see the guest appearances by various actors.
4,Great Book....Bad Copy Job.....,"The Dolphins of PernI have been a big fan of the Dragonriders of Pern series for years. I have read the whole series, except for the books written by Todd McCaffrey, twice and some of the books three times.I just bought my new toy, the Kindle, and I thought it would be a good idea to have the series on my Kindle. This the third I've read and I was very disappointed by the lack of proofreading involved in this book. There were typos all throughout the book and some so blatent as to be laughable!I always give all McCaffrey books a 5 star rating, but I had to give this one 4 stars because fot the typos.I hope the people that input the books take care to do a better job from now on!"
5,great books,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
3,Not a book,"At first blush, I was wondering whether this was a new book versus the old one sitting on my bookshelf ,with the same title, about 2 feet from me. The Dolphins of Pern is a good book. Just remember when you see this MP3 CD is an audio book.The paper book is much cheaper. Heck, you can't beat $4.00 for a Hardback including postage."
1,"Avoid later-day Pern stuff, read the early works","I am really not being fair, since I haven't read this book. But I've been burned by ""later day"" Pern books, so I am secure in telling people not to read this or anything made recently except All the Weyrs of Pern (it's a must, all the rest of poorly written unimportant crap).I really DO NOT like McCaffrey writing the story of the first settlement, or the first fall, or the founding of this or that place or weyr, since a) it takes the magic and legendary quality out of the Pern, and b) exposes us to her later-day writing, which is far less in quality than the Dragonwing/Harperhall trilogies and Moreta (gotta read Moreta!). Do yourself a favor, and don't read any of the ""early Pern"" books. Get what you need to know about the founders from Moreta and avoid the rest.P.S. What does she add things like talking dolphins later when they were NOT there from the beginning?"
3,this is an ongoing problem....,"Dear Anne...please please PLEASE get somebody to check for typos and continuity errors! When a character whose death in a previous novel was a main point in the plot suddenly reappears several years later...I'm sorry, but it just blows the entire illusion for me. And when did Aramina turn into such a b$$$$? If anyone, she should have sympathized with Readis's affinity for the dolphins..."
3,A good read if you absolutely can't get enough of Pern,"I have to agree with several of the reviews that noted how Anne McCaffrey's later works about Pern seem to have lost something that she did so well in her earlier ones. I am a loyal McCaffrey fan, so please don't take this as some kind of ""Anne-bashing""--but, The Dolphins of Pern just wasn't up to par with the first two trilogies. While the concept of the friendly, talking dolphins is appealing, the storyline goes all over the place, jumping over years in Readis' and other characters' lives, losing focus and generally feeling less like a plot than an ongoing report on the amazing new dolphins. I hope Anne isn't just writing in response to pressures from fans and her publisher, but I have a bad feeling that she became bored with Pern years ago. Read this book only if you are a Pern fanatic."
3,"Contacting the ""shipfish""","The ""shipfish"" are the dolphins of pern and they once helped they once accompanied the earlierest settlers of pern. Altough he child (Readis) who is not understood by his parents is reminiscent of Menolly's story, there's so much to like. I just wish there was more about the dolphins and less about Readis. Pern also has changed a lot in this book and what I think made Pern interesting is how people interacted and were dependant upon each other though the re-discovery of the dolphins and the events that take place after-ward will keep your eyes glued to the page."
1,Heard this story before,"Child wants to follow dream, is stifled by overbearing parent, has a serious injury, runs away from home, finds a cave, meets up with critters. Sound familiar? Sounds exactly like the plot of Dragon Song doesn't it. I was very disappointed. I love this series of books and the world of Pern, but I recommend you save your money and not purchase this book."
2,Worst book of the Dragonriders series,"Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series has always been one of my favorites. But this is no Dragonflight! The Dolphins of Pern is by far the worst Dragonrider book, with some of the least appealing characters. If I read about that kid Readis whining one more time I may just rip the book up. HOWEVER, this book does provide more insight into Pernese history (ie the dolphins), and some parts were quite enjoyable. But if you are new to the series, start with Dragonflight or Dragonsong--this will have no relevance to you if you have not read others of the series"
4,A TRIUMPH OF TRASH!,"I have been obsessed with this movie since I was about seven years old. I saw it on the afternoon movie while visiting my Grandparents one summer in Clovis, NM. Since that day, the hideous vision of the leprous Countess DeSade lurking around in the dungeon has never left me.I adore this movie in all its cheapness. I love watching it and I don't care what anyone says.The scene where the Countess DeSade in her rotting dress and veil steps out from the dark corner and says, ""I am the Countess!"", will haunt me forever.It is oddly one of the defining moments of my childhood, or at least something I remember better than almost anything else.I am STUNNED that this has been given a DVD release, but I am completely overjoyed!!"
3,Engrossing piece of trash!,"The budget for this turkey must have been about $[...]. The film looks like crap - with color fading in & out. The acting is horribly bad as well, but the story is amazing and bizarre. The leper is the dungeon scene is enough to make anyone's flesh crawl. The twist ending is great too, but I won't give that away here. If you are looking for cheap trashy thrills this might just fit the bill."
1,did I order these?,"Yes, they are small, but what I got and what's in the picture are not even close! My earrings are all orange stones with none of the lovely shading that enticed me to order them. Talk about being disappointed, that's an understatement. Too bad, so sad, I've been had."
2,a long and disappointing read,"If you like books about extremely self-absorbed people wondering why their lives are so meaningless, this is the book for you. I kept looking for a transformation in Kathleen, but as she jumped from her landlord's bed to many more, she only remained the Irish tramp so stereotyped in England. O'Faolin's historical narrative detailing the famine was fairly good. I finished the book but it was really a waste of time."
1,There are too many good books to waste your time on this one,"The only interesting thing about this book is the information about the famine. If that is of interest to you, I would suggest reading about it elsewhere. This book is too much muck to slog through to find few bits of historical information. The main character has no redeeming qualities and the self pity is enough to put you over the edge. I don't have a clue why this book was written or published. If you do give it a try and keep thinking it will get better, give up on it, it only gets worse."
1,Archie Bunker goes to Ireland,"I've often wondered why people found a fat, brainless, rude, emotionally abusive and bigoted man named Archie Bunker so amusing. I could never watch 'All in the Family' for more than 2 minutes. But millions did and it shouldn't surprise me that there are so many glorious recommendations for this book. The main character is so self-absorbed in her pathetic, empty and immoral life. I tried reading this book for my book club but had to stop about half way through. This book is torture and a complete waste of time. Maybe it's that Archie Bunker syndrome that there are so many people out there who really enjoy the idea that someone else's life is as bad if not worse than theirs."
3,"Lovely writing, really hard to like main character","I'm only halfway through this book, and the title for my review pretty much sums up my impressions. O'Faolain describes things beautifully. But I am completely exhausted with the main character's lack of character and obsessive self-reflection. Perhaps it is a generational thing (Gen X here), but I find her VERY difficult to relate to. Perhaps she'll find some personality by the end of the book, but I'm pretty much just hanging on in hopes that she grows a pair. (Tongue firmly in cheek.)"
3,What happened to quotation marks?,"I'm not ready to write a review of this book, although I am full of opinions, but as for now, I just want to know about this current trend of leaving out quotation marks. I gave up on Cold Mountain for this reason, and I was sorry after I bought ""My Dream of You"" when I realized she does this also. I have struggled through it because I have had to reread many passages when I realized it wasn't her thoughts, but someone speaking. What is the reason for this? Why is this considered acceptable?"
2,My Dream of You,"The characters seemed flat, one dimensional for the first 300 plus pages.I couldn't get myself to care about them. Much of the narrative in those pages seemed to me extraneous to the book. Only the last 100 plus pages held some interest. Had I not been reading this as my book club's choice I would have put it down after the first 50 pages."
4,My Dream of You,"This was a wonderful book. It's not a quick read; some of the passages tend to drag a bit. However, it is quite reflective and thought provoking. There were many passages I would have to ponder for a bit before I could return to the book -- some which made me feel like I needed a nap afterwards to recover.Kathleen is at the same time lovable and pathetic and annoying. Some of her qualities make her an unlikely heroine, but the reader can't help but wish her the best."
3,Depends on what you're looking for...,"I'm a big O'Faolain fan, but this book suffered by being way too long. I found the plot to drag, our heroine living a life a bit too surrealistic, and no all-absorbing element to suck the reader in and keep her/him reading. Being cheated on the Talbot story was perhaps O'Faolain's biggest crime! This was built up to be a pivotal part of the plot, but was never delivered. I was disappointed by this latest, but hope that others find it better than I did. Try Thomas Moran's _Water, Carry Me_ if you're looking for a great Irish romance with enough twist to keep you turning pages."
3,"Great imagery, slow story","I did not love this book. It was very long and often put me to sleep. Having said that, the imagery of Ireland is wonderful, and the mystery of the Talbot affair kept me reading. I wanted to know how that story turned out much more than the story of Kathleen and her lover. Not worth purchasing, perhaps a library read."
2,"For 500 pages, I expected a little more....","I got halfway through this book and was tempted to stop reading, but since I had already invested 250 pages I thought I would finish it.I was a little put off by the lack of quotation marks that make it hard to determine who was speaking at times.Kathleen was such an amoral character that it was hard to relate to her. And after all the expenditure about the Talbot case, I expected a little better resolution to that story.Not recommended."
3,Save your money - use your library card instead!,I had a heck of a time getting into this book - about 150 pages I forced myself to read before I got to the point where I actually wanted to continue to read. Maybe it is because I am only 21 and have a difficulty relating to the 50 year old main character. Maybe I don't agree with her values. I have to admit the only thing that's keeping me reading is the silly romance. This one is not going to be a classic. Not a book I'm going to read again. Not a book I recommend purchasing. Go check it out at the library and save yourself the money.
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait to read this book because I enjoyed Nuala's autobiographal effort so much. I actually found the novel disappointing and almost embarrassing at times. The central character Kathleen is a bit of a dag, whiny, self obsessed, humourless. The other characters just don't come alive somehow. The plot is predictable and plodding. The sex scenes are cringe making. I guess it really lost me when Kathleen's middle aged lover leaves his false teeth on the bed. More detail than I needed, Nuala."
1,Terrible,"Such a shame- I had hopes for this one. Instead it was drivel. Overwrought, florrid nonsense. Absolutely hated the main character. Full of navel gazing and embarrassing sex scenes."
5,Introspection and Passion,"I bought it for my wife, but it's not just a woman's book. Nuala O'Faolain weaves together the past and present of Kathleen de Burca (herself) with an old marital scandal of an English landlord and his wife from mid-19th century Ireland. In so doing, she connects the reader with his/her own personal and cultural pain and life struggles, causing one to make personal evaluations of life as it is.O'Faolain has a unique ability to weave the story together in a fashion that draws you in. You feel like you know her personally; you feel like you are there. I think that's because she connects us with the pleasures and disappointments and crises we all know and experience in life.It isn't necessary, but one gains additional understanding of Kathleen de Burca by reading O'Faolain's ""Are You Somebody"" before reading ""My Dream of You.""It's not just a woman's book. It's a passionate, soul-searching read. I recommend it."
2,Self-Obsessed,"The beginning of this boox was wonderful -- unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative about the Irish Famine fascinating and quite well-written, and then was excited about the prospect of a different kind of historical fiction, along with the critical perspective on travel writing...but the book disintegrates from there. The narrator can't stop thinking and talking about herself. The whole book is fileld with ""I""s that are uneccessary, from a technical viewpoint, and the character/author is so self-obsessed that when her best friend comes to her in a moment of crisis, the author's only response is ""But she didn't ask me about ME, can you believe it?"" UGH."
2,too long--unfocused,"A 500+ page book is a huge commitment of time. I had this book on my bookshelf for years, and decided to finally read it. It started strong but lost its way mid-way. Because I was over 200 pages into it, I decided to keep reading. It was a slow read. The portions of the book that related to the Irish Potato Famine were enthralling. However, I found the protagonist to be poorly drawn and her behavior inexplicable--the text never really delved into what made her tick. In the end I came away with the feeling that this book could have used a good editor who would have helped the author decide on her focus and then edit the text down to its appropriate length. This story could have been written in half the pages, and I would not recommend that people commit their time to reading this book because in the end you will come away frustrated and sorry you spent so much time reading a mediocre book."
3,would benefit from some major editing,"There is some excellent evocative writing in this novel. If only it were properly edited, I would have enjoyed it much more. I would start with the novel within the novel, which just is not very good, with a heroine of little interest. My appreciation of Kathleen, as her life and self-examination unfold, would have been on firmer ground if I were privy, earlier in the book, to the events which led directly to Kathleen fleeing Ireland. The episode between Kathleen and Carole's ex-husband was overkill.Finally, I think Kathleen had enough of a moral sense, at her worst, not to list Shay's being a happy husband as possibly being one of things which made her fall in love with him (p.414); I do understand that if you are seeking a mate, PREVIOUS happiness with a spouse is a positive."
5,Poignant,"It took me some time to read this book. I would read a chapter, put it down and go about doing something else, then pick it up again. At 500+ pages, and densely written, it's not one of those ""I couldn't put it down"" books. But Kathleen slowly wound her way into my heart and I read the last 250-odd pages in two nights. O'Faolain writes in so much detail about Kathleen's thoughts and feelings--in a lesser writer,such in-depth description would have been boring and tedious. But O'Faolain's writing is never that. Thought-provoking, especially for someone like myself with ties to Ireland, and the Ireland of the famine. I did find some of the writing about the Talbot Case frustrating in that at first I wasn't sure whether it was Kathleen fictionalizing it or whether it was truly what happened. Perhaps that was deliberate on O'Faolain's part.I would recommend the book to those who enjoy reading a mixture of fact and fiction, who enjoy reading detailed life stories. I certanly did."
4,A good read for any woman 35-100,"My Dream of You was not only an entertaining story, it provided a poignant insight into historic Ireland and the dilemmas and dreams (yes, there are some left!) faced by middle-aged women. I found the story at once depressing and inspiring, reminding me that even though I'm ""getting up there"" my life is by no means over yet and if I am going to get anything out of the rest of it I have to ""do the active thing."" The only drawback I found was that I had to be able to read with little distraction as Kathleen jumps from decade to decade and back again at every turn. Cudos to Nuala O'Faolain. Well done."
1,Too down and depressing,"There was something that drew me to this book, maybe it was the cover, I don't know. But after I started it, I had a very hard time reading it, much as I wanted to. The woman was so unhappy, and everything seemed so miserable, I couldn't continue. If you want a book that involves intrigue, fun, confidence, genuine passion, or anything of similar like, I would not recommend this book to you."
1,Explosion!,"I loved this pot until the ""Explosion"".A few weeks ago while I was cooking with the lid on, stove not very high, I lifted the lid to stir the pot and the lid EXPLODED all was left was the handle and a spoiled sunday lunch. I was lucky that I didn't get injured, but I was very disappointed. I only handwash the pot so I don't know what could have caused this..So just beware..."
5,happy,i got it fast and just in time to ship it to my friend for xmas. she loved it. that made even happier.
3,a so so image,"this image is not very reallistic compared to the official sets, but for the price I guess it is ok"
2,When an 'engineer' ruins everything...,"What do ""engineers"" have in their heads to treat such masterpieces the way Mr. Crimp did with these Mengelberg recordings? They're 'overfiltered' and with serious problems of balance in the Franck Symphony. As a result, one does not hear the clicks and noises present in the original, but high frequencies are not present either. IMO Mr. Crimp made the ""mediocre"" originals sound even more mediocre.As for the performances, if you appreciate Mengelberg's abilities as a colorist (like I do) and if you're, just like me, a fan of his surprising and funny rubati, these performances are for you. But, for God's sake, try to purchase the earlier Teldec reissue of the Dvorak (Symphony 9 "" New World "") and the Opus Kura edition of the Franck (Franck: Symphony in D; French Music). With all the clicks and noises/hiss there's much more music in these alternative releases.The performances deserve 5 stars, but the ""remastering""..."
3,Nice from Feist,"I love Feist,but this cd is just re do's! And i did'ent care for the song's not sang from Feist.Only true fans should buy this cd..."
2,Only for fans of feist and remixes,"I love Feist's music, I think the true formula for her succes are great music pieces combined with awesome lyrics, saddly most of this renixes disrupt the lyrics and the music leaving a black hole where the essence of Leslie Feist's songs are lost. Yet if you are a fan of feist and remixes there are a couple of songs that sound great, but rather than buying the album I would buy those songs digitally."
2,Feist Butchery,"Wow, if id actaully paid for this album i'd be even more angry right now! There are some nice remixes on this album, but more importantly there or some real howlers, who is this ""VV"", cut his attemps and you'd have a good album, im not sure if its possible to mangle mushaboom more, even if he tried. If you loved Let it die, which i did, dont buy this, youll be sorry...oh im listening to Open Season as i write this, When i was a young girl [vv mix] is playing, seriously cringe worthy"
2,Didn't Like the Combat Experience,"I don't like RPG's where you only control one character in the party, and the computer controls everyone else. I want to be able to control every action; that's how I prefer to play RPG's. Therefore, I did not like this game, despite the good setting (though the story was generic, the ~10 hours I played through). I'm sure other reviews cover the positives, but this negative was enough that I stopped after [constantly] replaying content because the AI was another hostile enemy. This may give the impression the game is hard, but it isn't. I could see how to beat every battle, if only the AI would cooperate. It would not combo with me, and it would not heal me. I was not interested in repeatedly grinding so my main character could one-shot everything, not with *that* combat system. YMMV."
2,A soulless entry in a soulless series,The Tales of series is as boring and as generic a JRPG can be. There are better series that are more worthy of your time and money.
4,Give it another chance,"Yes, this games has a lot against it: crap graphics, a 2D battle system that consists of little more than button mashing, character outfits so weird looking that I was convinced the main character would turn out to be a robot, no voice acting for half the game, and its the only main tales game not made by the tales team. On the other hand, this is one of the few games that really pushes character development. Unlike most RPGs, which add tons of characters to the group of heros and then ignores them for the rest of the game, you get to know all the characters and watch relationships develop between them, pushing you to finish the game just to see what happens next. The only exception to this is Shirley, who is boring, has an annoying voice, and is scarily obsessed with the main character to the point of trying to kill ALL humans just because he says he doesn't like her."
3,Mediocre and Melodramatic,"While it has admittedly fantastic music and good voice acting, most everything else about the game you can find elsewhere and better. There is no reason to own this specific game when you can buy the latest installment in the series, Tales of Vesperia, instead. If nothing else, Tales of Vesperia on Xbox 360 will give you the same repackged archetypes and endless, self-indulgant cameos one would expect from the series, only prettier and more refinded."
5,"bad angel, why you so bad?","well basically all i had to say was already (...) in the reviews, and all i can say is that if you have the chance, play tales of symphonia first. this is a way different experience imo. oh and ignore the kid's review. so what if their weapons are funky. that dosen't matter."
4,Good Re-release.,Good product. No Problems. Originally for dreamcast. I noticed some slowdowns in places where there was a lot going on. But that is to be expected for ports to the playstation. Also some slowdowns between menus and whatnot.
4,Fairy Tales are Timeless,"Remember when you were a little girl? We each loved dreaming that we were a princess and that we were whisked away by our prince charming. That is why this movie is so appealing.It is a decent, witty movie that you won't be afraid to take your daughter to.This movie is not corny. It is very well written with no sexual content or profanity. How refreshing! Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, and Hector Elizondo work so well together. They are charming and very loveable.It is so wonderful to find a great ""escape"" kind of movie such as this one. One where you can leave the stresses of the world behind and dream of fairy tales coming true.If you want to see a movie that will make you smile - and one that you won't have to peek over your child's shoulders with to double check on the content...Princess Diaries is a wonderful selection."
4,A Royal Delight,"PD2 was a suprise for me. I wouldn't have even seen this movie if I hadn't bought the first one and got the free pass to see this one. It was pure sugary sweet, wholesome goodness without being to goodie-goodie.The queen of ever lasting goodness, Julie Andrews, reprises her royal role and appears to be having a lot of fun. The plot is simple. Princess Mia has to get married in 30 days to retain her crown. One problem: She's not dating, seeing or in love with anyone.This is a great movie for teenage girls because it sends a positive message to young ladies. It is also refreshing to see a film every once in awhile that has no foul language, nudity, sex and violence. This is a film for all ages including adults.If you like the first one, then you'll enjoy the second. If you haven't seen the first one, that's OK, you'll still fall in love with PD2."
3,not as bad as you might think,"When I had heard that there was going to ba a sequel, I was excited. I saw a six minute preview, and yes, she is 21. The story line is this: her grandmother is going to abdicate from the throne. Mia will become the queen, but she must marry within 30 days. There is a big hassle to find the right man, and it is down to two guys.I like the fact that they use the same people for the same characters, like Lilly and Joseph. And though other people might think otherwise, I think that this movie will be entertaining, though I agree that the plot does make the first movie pointless."
1,God Awful!!,"I really struggled to find a way to put a positive spin on this bad film. The only star I can give credit where credit is due for is for Julie Andrews and her amazing comeback from a disastrous vocal cord surgery to sing in this film. Aside from that, this film was not funny, nor was it interesting. I never laughed once.This is really a big problem with Hollywood studios nowadays. They see a successful formula and they try to capitalize and make a sequel. But along the way, they forgot to make a great script. There's nothing wrong with making money. But why on earth would you sell your soul for a bad storyline. The screenplay is 90 percent of your movie. Disney should have concentrated on that instead of hurrying a sequel. Don't bother with this god awful film!And to those who gave this movie 5 stars to this trash, ""What were you watching?"""
1,Whoah ?,"Look, i have to say this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. I saw it at night and turned it off halfways through because i was so bored. You see there was a plot of course, which was very ""discretely"" forshadowed when the princess drops her crown and a man picks it up saying something like, ""Be careful princess someone might want to steal your crown so don't drop it--like me."" That was in the first five minutes of the movie. This movie has only attempted to follow the usual cliches such as having the princess encourage all the orphans to be princess too or falling into a fountain with the man she won't attempt to loving because he's trying to steal the thrown from her. There were times when i was unsure of whether i should be laughing or crying. this movie reminded me of bad comic strips that aren't clearly funny or dramatic."
4,Great Film for the Whole Family -- Especially Girls,"There are times when I'm embarrassed to say I like this series of movies, but I do! Yeah, they are a bit hokey and cloying, but they are also fun and something the entire family can watch together. In addition, the movie has a nice message about standing own your own two feet, accepting responsibility for your actions, and understanding the effects of your choices on those around you. **SPOLIER** Another great thing about this film is that Julie Andrews sings a song, especially considering the damage to her vocal chords after having corrective surgery done on them. She sounds great and it's nice to see her singing a song for young girls again. A great family film!"
2,No one's driving this bus(t),"Just a bad, bad Disney movie with almost none of the elements working. All of the quirky characters, like the over-enthusiastic ladies in waiting, or the loudmouthed captain of the guard, were not in the least amusing. The plot is laid out in simple terms three or four times, so that we can be sure to keep up (never mind the fact that we all know where it's going from the start), and most of the humor is based on how cutely folksy Hathaway is, or how hip Julie Andrews as the Genovian Queen can be (she rides a mattress down a staircase during a princess slumber party, and then dances to modern music!) (!!!!). The movie was too bland to get a lower rating, but if I felt like I didn't have to leave some space for those movies which flop stupendously or are offensive, I would have given this a 1."
1,Um I don't know ............................................,"I fell into the trap of seeing this movie to find out more on Princess Mia's fate. What a total dissapointment. I fell asleep half way through it! I feel this movie was made for 2 year olds. It was just to plain and predictable. Now I do think Anne Hathaway is funny but at times it just doesn't look natural. After five years of being princess, she should've tamed her clumsiness. It's just too silly at times. Not even Julie Andrews could save this movie. Her lines are not funny! The writer didn't put enough drama as in the first film. It was a little fast paced but I do think that it was interesting to see how difficult it is to have a relationship when you are a princess and the stress of having to marry someone without love. If you have tots see this one, if not I say skip it."
4,My Review on Princess Diaries 2,I thought this movie was better than the first one only because there was a better story line to it.
3,NOT as good as Princess Diaries 1,"I actually kind of liked The Princess Diaries, even if it was a ""girls"" movie. This one screams ""lets make some money off the fans of P1!""with a cheaper look to the movie, it was filmed on location in Los Angeles and much of it either looks like a studio lot or some sets not up to the standard of the original movie. The plot is sort of all over the place and often slow, I kept finding my self hitting the fast forward button on my DVD player, and the new casting is weird (they did bring back most of the original actors, that helped save the movie).I especially hated Raven's appearance, not because of her but because it was so obviously being used as a promotional tool for her Disney stuff.Most of the time Anne Hathaway was very good (although the clumsy bit is getting old),I doubt that was actually her in the opening college graduation scene. She and the other originals were what made this movie worthwhile."
4,Princess Diaries 2 Review,"I was looking forward to Princess Diaries 2 with excitement and I was not disappointed. I loved the 2nd movie as much as the first. Mia is more sophisticated now and much more the princess, but you feel yourself still loving the character. I can hardly wait for it to come out on video. I will buy it right away."
2,"No Michael, No movie","I think anyone who has read all 5 of the book series would agree with me that this movie is a waiste of time unless michael and mia are together. If this movie is about her finding another guy to MARRY, then why did they have michael and mia together in the first place? I am not interested in this movie at all, and it is a big dissapointment if you read the books, although the books are 10 times greater than the movies anyways."
2,A big thumbs down compared to the original,"Princess Diaries 2 will be such a bummer for those who loved Princess Diaries. Robert Schwartzman, as Michael in the first movie, will not returning to be in the sequel. So basically, the plot is now, that the first movie wasn't really like a fairy tale, true love doesn't exist. There will be a new guy playing a prince who Mia will fall in love with. I'm sorry, but that just ruins the first movie."
1,You're forgeting about US!,"We 10-12 year old boys don't understand the mysterious likings of jewerly, fashion, and how we are SO cute to girls. My mother even likes this film. Don't buy this 'cause it's too peppy and sexist to the male gender. Also, this should'nt be considerd as a ""Family"" film. Why? Boys are part of the family, this ""Family"" movie isn't for the whole family. Go buy a non-sexist, worth-viewing, real movie insted. What grosses me the most is that this film was directed by a BOY."
2,"Boo - My wife made me suffer this eyeball murderer, Good HD quality though",Worst movie I have ever had to suffer in the confines of my own home. This is a total chick flick and should be flagged as such. I'm having nightmares involving this movie playing in an endless loop...
4,great service,The DVD was in good condition when I received the package. It also arrived very quickly. I will definitely recommend this seller.
1,Messed up,"I bought this to complete my set and it had scratches all ovr. Not ""like new"". People rlt need to understand what these categories mean. Like new is LIKE NEW! Not scratched to where it doesn't play! Ergh."
1,Pure garbage.,"The first movie was fun, but so so. This one was a total loss. Got it because wife wanted the set in our library. It has a good ensemble cast, but none of the roles have purpose, develop, or really support each other. Not the fault of the actors. Total amateur work by the writers that is reenforced by the director."
5,The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,"Mia has matured into a stunning, young woman and is ready to assume her role as princess of Genovia. But no sooner has she moved into the Royal Palace with her beautiful, wise grandmother Queen Clarisse, than she soon learns her days as a princess are numbered--Mia's got to lose the tiara and immediately take the crown herself. As if getting ready to rule wasn't enough, the stakes for Mia have never been higher--with Genovian law stating that princesses must be married before being crowned, Mia's in for a parade of suitors who'd all like to be her king. Princess Diaries 2 does incredible wonders to a person's attitude. A enchanting movie, that will keep you smiling."
5,A royally good movie! By Ashly,"If you ever dreamed of becoming a queen and ruling a palace then this movie is for you. Princess' Diaries Two is a movie to be loved by all and watched more than once.Mia's grandma teaches Mia how to become a princess and a queen. The queen invited Lord Deveral and his nephew, Nicholas to stay at the queen's palace. Mia's problem is that she has to get married. She has to have an arranged marriage and get married to Andrew Jacjabe but she has feelings for Nicholas.Does Mia marry Andrew Jacjabe or Nicholas? Find out when you watch Princess Diaries 2. Hopefully there will be a Princess Diaries 3."
5,Childhood favorite,"I love this movie. I remember watching them when they came out. Chris Pine, Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews and Princesses what more could you possibly want?"
3,Its good for kids and adults,"I was looking for something fun that both parents and kids could watch together. Its not an amazing storyline, but entertaining family fun."
5,great,It was a fun movie which I enjoyed. It was light and fluffy. The actors were very good in their parts.
2,"The only reason why I gave it two stars is because the jokes were so bad, I actually thought they were kind of funny","This movie really only deserves one star, but i gave it two because, like I said, it was so bad it was funny. It was so predictable. Disney has done it again: take a pretty but not very talented actress (Anne Hathaway), give her lots of pretty dresses, corny lines, a sunny dispotion, and call it a movie. I haven't actaually read the books, so I have no idea if they're good or not, but the movies certainly aren't. I guess it's ok for little kids who want a cheap , cute movie, but it's still really bad."
5,I LOVE PRINCESS DIARIES 2!!!!,"I absolutely love The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. It was so completely wonderful. Every aspect of it was great- from the acting to the story to even the beauty of Genovia. Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews were wonderful. Also Mia's to love interests were wonderful and I did not miss Michael one bit. In fact, this movie was better without him. I just couldn't see him in the love interest role. Don't let the only 3 stars fool you into thinking it isn't that great because it was only given negative reviews by people who haven't seen the movie and are upset it isn't like the books. It is not supposed to be like the books at all. It is an entirely different story based on the CHARACTERS created by Meg Cabot. You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It fills you with the happiness and love that the first movie provides and it is just as enjoyable as the first if not more. I love The Princess Diaries 2:Royal Engagement!!!!"
4,The Princess Diaries,"I love Julie Andrews and she did such a wonderful job in this moview.Anne Hathaway does a great job, also."
3,O.k......,"I saw the first princess diaries when i was about 9. I loved it!! I saw it over and over and it always gave me the inside laugh. When I found out the 2nd one was out I was sortive wary. I didnt want to see the guy she married and all the romance. My younger sister tricked me into seeing it.(you did not need to know that) and so I went to the theater. From the first 5 minutes i knew i had wasted my money...sortive. Ya its cheesier than the first, the comedy isnt at all funny, and its not as witty script. But halfway through the movie I couldnt wait for it to be over. The movie was o.k. and is one you should see but isnt one to buy so you should probably rent it. There are some good scenes but this one doesnt seem to expand the characters. Mia's best friend Lily is not the same at all. And wheres the guy that Mia supposedly liked. The maids seem really obnoxious and etc...like i said you should probably just rent this. Its o.k. but not a hit."
1,Horrible sequel to PD1,This movie was so disappointing. It was completely different from the first movie AND all the books. Where in the world was Michael?
3,A step down,"Princess 2 is a step down from the first. While the first was sweet and cute, there's nothing of that here. Instead you get a movie only a tween will like. All the adult charm is taken away and filled with fluff. I'd expect more from Disney."
5,Princess Mia has to get married...,"Princess Mia has been busy since we left her in the Princess Diaries. She has had Princess lessons, and has also just graduated from college.Queen Clarisse, Mia's grandmother, wants to step down so that Mia can become Queen but the royal ad visors say that she can not be Queen until she is married. There is another hiccup also. Viscount Maybrey wants his nephew Nicholas Devereaux to be King since he also has royal ancestry. The advisers say they will give Mia one month to find a husband and then she can become Queen.Mia is given a list of suitable husbands (one of which was Prince William) and she picks Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth. They get engaged to be married, but Mia finds herself falling for Nicholas instead (even though she cannot stand him.) Things come to a head at Mia and Andrew's wedding. What happens after? Watch the movie.This is a very good sequel to The Princess Diaries and Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine (who plays Nicholas) are great."
2,"a cute movie, but not at all like book","I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I am such a big fan of all the books. After I saw it, I was disappointed, though. It is NOTHING like the book. I thought it cute, but very disapointing."
3,"Good, but could be better","This was a good movie, but I thought the first movie was better than the sequel. THe first movie stayed true to the novel, while the second movie wasn't at all. I mean, it was cool, seeing a european country, and mia as a princess, but wat happened to michael??? he was supposed to be mia's true love, not nicholas."
1,I don't think I quite understand,"Aside from introducing information that would have made the storylines of the books obsolete, this film fails to deliver as either a serious drama (yeah, right), a romantic comdey, or any form of comedy ast all. The humour is poor, at best, and the acting is remminicent of that of any badly-written teen movie. A let down for fans pf the book everywhere. Why bother?"
2,Hello?? Ever hear of 'Following the story line'????,"I saw a behind-the-scenes clip for this movie, and I am OUTRAGED!! They're going to make Mia get married! For all of the people who've read the Princess Diaries Books by Meg Cabot, you will Not be pleased! I mean, who gets married at 15 years old?!?! The sickos! And whatever happened to Michael? Though I will admit, it does look somewhat funny, but since it SO does not follow the true story line written in Cabot's books, I think maybe they should change the title. Maybe to...A Royal Engagement: Sequal to The Princess Diaries MOVIE, NOT based on the Book by Meg Cabot!!! Ok, sorry about that...I just had to get that out, lol! Ok, I hope all the book & movie fans of The Princess Diaries found this review helpful, and I hope you still see the movie and enjoy it...when you do, though, maybe you should just pretend a book-story-line doesn't exist for that day? :-)"
3,delicious- all are not simple!,"This recipe book contains some delicious recipes for one or two. Some are more difficult than others, so if you are looking for a simple fast recipe, this is not your book. If you are willing to take some time to prepare a nice meal for yourself, induldge and enjoy! Very good finds, that can also be doubled or tripled for more guests!"
5,Great gift idea,This is a great gift idea. I already had it but a relative mentioned cooking meals for one. I was able to get a new copy and send it to her. Great value deal.
4,Feeds One What? Linebacker?!?,"First, the praise: I do enjoy the receipes and the attention to details. After many years of cooking and being an empty-nester, if I can't find the exact ingredient I make a reasonable substitution. The Stilton burger is almost as good with a domestic blue cheese and not nearly as expensive. The fish receipes are very good and give me an excuse to try new fish.The complaint: who is eating all this food in one sitting?!? I always have enough left-over for at least more full meal. Be careful, not everything reheats successfully."
1,Too froufrou.,"I got this book as a gift, and really, it has more use as a coaster than a cookbook. It seems to be written from the point of view of a lonely old brittish bachelor, it's short on use and long on fluffy language. It has very few actual entree recipes, and they are all complex. If you are interested in finding good nutritious easy recipes for single servings, skip this one. You're better off trying to scale down the recipes in Betty Crocker. The only plus to it was that it has pretty pictures in it."
3,Item looks good - description is wrong.,"If you are looking for a small calculator, this is probably ok. I didn't use it, so don't know how well it functions. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a desktop calucator that is as big as the description - DON'T BUY THIS ONE. It is only 5.5 x 4 inches. I'm returning it. No problem there.Just wish it had been the advertised size."
2,CASIO Calculator,Incorrect model number was shipped. Not exactly as adverised or ordered. Amazon was very understanding and refunded my purchase price promptly.
2,Tax Rate,"How do you set the tax rate for these calculators? If someone out there knows, could you email me at: pwmpn2@umr.edu"
4,Portable Size But Large Enough to Use/Read,"The buttons and display on this calculator make it easy to use, but the size of the actual unit is nice and portable and doesn't take up too much room.Someone asked about setting the tax rate: Hold ""SET"" down until SET appears on display. Press ""TAX+"". Enter desired tax rate (i.e. 8.75). Press ""SET"" again to save. You can recall the set tax rate by pressing the ""TAX+"" button once."
3,Product is not the one pictured,I didn't catch this but the picture is of model MS-80TE (which is what I wanted) but the title is for model MS-80TV. It is only a slight difference but the MS-80TV is a bit larger and the buttons are different shaped. I REALLY liked my old MS-80TE and was hoping to replace it with the same model. The MS-80TE works and I am sure I will get used to the larger size and the buttons. Just wish the picture reflected the actual product received.
4,Dreaming in Clay -- A Dream of a Book!,"I wrote the 1st review of this book. There are 3 typo's in the second paragraph. It should read ""Shearwater POTTERY not potter, (2) struggled not strugged, and (3) their ART not air. Thanks for letting me make these corrections."
1,complex notation system,"I did not use this book while teaching my child to read. This book requires the child and the teacher to learn a complex system of notation. More than just learning the different sounds letters can make together, this book requires you to number, actually write out and memorize a number, for each letter than can be sounded out in more than one way. So the words you learn to write, spell, and read are diagramed with numbers. It's very complex. I would not even attempt to teach my child using this system. It seems very frustrating. This program also requires the child to be able to write everything that is to be read. My child is beginning to read well and enjoys practicing writing, but he is not required to write the word before he can progress in his reading. I recommend instead Phonics Pathways by Dolores Hiskes and the excellent starter books by Nora Gaydos in the Now I'm Reading series."
1,Difficult to use,"This book is NOT easy to read or follow. I found the layout of the book very cumbersome. I have used many different texts as I have homeschooled my daughter and this book is by far the most difficult to use. The instructions provided in WRTR for reading, writing and spelling are not at all well defined. It is not clear where to begin and where to end. I budget for my daughters school books every year and I now find myself having to invest in more books to cover these topics as well as putting us about 2 months behind schedule for this schoolyear. I found myself reading and re reading this book to try to make sense of it to no avail."
5,Learning to Read is Hard!,"This is a great program, but very difficult! My mother taught me to spell using the WRTR, so I was very excited to try it with my 4 year old. After only a couple of weeks, he knows almost the first 26 sounds! And he can write half of them...amazing progress.I was disappointed...the phonogram cards need to be purchased separately. So, while the book is inexpensive, it is really not enough to do the program. You have to have those cards!Also, I was disappointed in the general approach...I believe this program is probably mostly used in the home environment, however, this book is definitely written with the classroom in mind. You can adapt it, but it gets a little frustrating!So...overall...awesome program. The results are definitely worth the hard work to learn how to teach it. Good luck!"
3,overwhelmed by book's organization,"This book is confusingly organized, and got a bit frustrating trying to figure out how the whole system works, I felt like I was going to miss something by how it was organized and wasn't entirely confident in what I was doing. I ended up purchasing Teach Your Child to Read in 100 easy lessons, and saved the Writing Road to Reading so I could use the Ayeres word list for my 1st grade son. I can see the benefits of teaching your child the spelling list, as they will learn why certain sounds are spelled certain ways."
2,I really tried to like this book...,"After reading The Well Trained Mind and Classical Christian Homeschooling and both recommending this book I really, really was excited to try this book. After opening the book, which is large--not thick, but large as in phone book size, I was so frustrated and ended up sending the book back to Amazon. I consider myself to be fairly smart, I have a college degree and taught in a public school, but this Spalding method looked like a foreign language to me. I have no idea how children can memorize these numbers and be expected to write tiny numbers by their words before they can really even write well. It probably works wonderfully and I may regret sending it back at some point but it seemed to me to be the single most confusing system of teaching reading, writng, and phoinics I've ever seen. I do recommend however Phonics Pathways, and Teach Your Child To Read in 100 Easy Lessons."
5,Used Book,I purchased this book used and I was made aware before I purchased that the rear cover had a fold in it. I decided to go ahead and purchase the book anyway and was amazed when the book came. I could barely detect the small crease in the back cover. I was definately pleased with the savings and the book with hardly any damage.
3,Blue Knight,"Not one of my favorites. Couldn't get it to stand. My 8yo had to prop /lean it on something. It's okay, - not one of my favorites, but it will serve the play/fantasy purpose it was intended for.Unless it's super cheap, I'd pass on this one."
4,This blender is cool.,"I bought this blender to take on the road with me and ended up using it mostly at home. It blends up my fruits and veges when I feel like making raw vegan soups or sauces. I love that I don't have to plug it in and find it easy to clean and use. There are 2 different crank options, one for heavy duty blending and one for mild. Obviously you provide the muscle but not much is needed. You will need to keep it steady (it does come with a mediocre clamp) and it takes a little getting used to but I'm quite happy with this unit."
3,Not what I expected.,"It actually became like a work out just to try and blend anything on this. It needs two people to blend, and it doesn't liquefy. The product is a bad invention from my perspective."
5,Constipation Relieved,"Hi, I've never written a review before. I am having trouble finding Paragone II, the 2nd part of the treatment, but I anticipate additional digestive improvements. I would recommend this product to anyone with digestive issues, if your doctor says it is OK."
2,WORKS,"Received the product on time. I was hoping to get what it appears to be but the cap that goes over the fill hole is NOT SCREW on, Therefore it didn't work for me."
4,Entirely different type of book,"This is not your typical werewolf romance. In fact, this is not paranormal romance, this is more urban fantasy. I liked the authors writing. I didn't mind the change in point of view. I enjoyed all the characters except the main character, Ivy. This woman is not to be messed with. The author is very thorough in her background on wolves and well she should be since she spent a year observing real wolves. It certainly paid off in this book. If you're looking for romance, this is not your book. If you're looking for something different and a little on the dark side, then you should enjoy it. I for one found it very entertaining."
5,"At last, a FRESH horror author with a new take on an old tale","I decided to read this book based on the fact it was a finalist for the IPPY awards for best first horror novel by a new author. I read the book straight through - something I rarely do anymore. Ivy is a different werewolf - one more like the ancient wolf strain introduced to her in the aftermath of the intial werewolf attack she endured on Christmas Eve as a child in Germany. This is a great read with likeable, eccentric characters, setting and dialogue which capture the region, unexpected twists, and the real treat - intelligent. And if you don't have an opinion about wolves - you may find you do by the end. I anxiously await the sequel!!"
5,Ivy has reached the moon...,"To say this was a page-turner is a definite understatement. You don't have to be an animal lover to appreciate the detail and descriptions Farago so eloquently gives throughout the story. I enjoyed being surprised and caught off guard with the suspense and drama, because it was not expected and kept me guessing throughout the novel. Farago has mastered the difficult task of keeping her readers captivated and intrigued by this story which jumps off the page at you. There is a little bit of Ivy in all of us and I look forward to the next installment."
3,"Not bad, not great - nice diversion.","Actually I had to look twice at the cover on this book as the art work makes it look more like a young adult novel. The girl on cover looks to me younger than the character in the book it supposed to be. ANYHOW, the book kept me reading; I like werewolf stories and having just been in the state of North Carolina where the book takes place I gave the book a try. The first half of the book does keep you guessing as to who the killer - wait I better not give too much away. I will be interested to see if the author continues the story of Ivy."
2,inconsistant plot,"This is an okay story, nothing great. It had a slow start, and I didn't think very detailed or indepth as far as the charecters go. I don't know if this is an editing issue, or how it was written, but my book seemed like it was out of order or missing stuff. A subplot would be finished, then it would start over and in another section a subplot was begun, but without any supporting information. It was confusing and frustrating. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone, but I am willing to give the author another chance."
5,Ivy Cole and the Moon,This was my first book by Gina Farago and it will not be by last. I enjoyed reading this book and loved how it was able to keep my attention throughout. This was definitely not your typical werewolf book.
2,"meh, it's dull","It started out well, but the longer it went on, the less interesting I found the story line. The vengeful werewolf idea was appealing, but I don't like the way the book skipped from the different character POVs. I also found the writing acceptable, but not extraordinary. The romance was also pretty crappy. IMHO."
3,Okay,"This is a great book but the only thing that irked me, was how the book favored dogs more than humans. More sympathy is given to dogs, if I wanted to read a dog-based book than I would read the Dog Whisperer...I was looking forward to a story about a werewolf, not a dog rights activist who prefers dogs as friends to humans...geez I know that sometimes society/humans can be cruel, but there is always someone out there who is sweet and honest."
2,Boring,"I found this book boring and regretted paying for it. I didn't really care what happened to anyone and started skipping sections so I could ""finish"" it."
5,Measuring Spoons Measure Up,These are the heaviest most rugged spoons I have ever encountered. As they were a premium to on my order the superior quality was not expected. A person is going to have to take extra effort in order to damage the set.
5,Very interesting,"I have read quite a few books about the science of disease research and this is one of the best yet. Folkman's story is fascinating and Cooke tells it well. Highly recommended!Also recommended:""Decoding Darkness"" on Alzheimer's by Tanzi and Parson"
2,"interesting story, but ......","I work in this field of research. I do like the story of the persistance and creativity of Judah Folkman. However, the author stumbles in describing some of the science and the intellectual contributions of others that led to some of the Folkman lab's discoveries. After reading the reviewers' praise for Mr. Cooke's ""detailed research "" on the book's back cover, I was diappointed by some obvious errors in the book. I believe that most of the innaccuracies are the unfortunate result of the author's failure to corroborate all of his facts. He may have been in a hurry to get the book out, but I wish that he had taken a little more time to get the science and other facts straight."
5,Dr. Folkmans War,"This book is a very well done documentary of the trials Dr. Folkman went through to have his ideas on cancer treatment considered. His ideas are now becoming the new approach, offering much needed hope for patients and their families. For anyone interested in cancer, this book is worthwhile."
2,Doesn't cover ALL MODELS,"This haynes repair manual says ""1988-1998 - All Models"", but does it cover the full-floating axle in my 1988 3500/1-Ton? No. It's your typical repair manual though, a fair amount of information for the do-it-yourself kind of guy. You'll probably notice that many of the instructions or the pictures are too vague to make any kind of sense of when you need that information the most...but sometimes the book is helpful. 2 stars."
4,Long Wait for delivery/Good Info,"By the time I received this repair manual, I had fixed the truck,s "" no heat"" problem. I haven't even looked in the book. It's there for the next problem that I can't fix without a manual."
1,mediocre,"Although I have many Haynes manuals and continue to buy them, I am generally disappointed when I use them. I recently wanted to know about the PCV valve (like where it is and what it looks like. The picture in the book looks like it is from a mid 70's car, not a '99. This is quite common for Haynes. Their books go into great detail on easy things like unbolting an alternater, but are very sparse on more difficult things like transmissions, emissions, ignition, torque specs, capacities, and wiring -- exactly the things I need vehicle specific information on. Haynes manuals pale in comparison to more comprehensive manuals published by Bentley. I have a Bentley manual for my VW, I wonder if there is a similarly conprehensive manual for Chevy trucks. I will look.P.S. If you know very little about mechanics, a Haynes book is an OK start, but you outgrow them fast and you will be frustrated trying to find simple info such as tire pressure."
3,Good Guideline,"it doesn't go quite far enough but as a first step it's good enough, If you are in a hurry I would recomend it."
3,Not as thorough as the Chilton's Manual...,"I am keeping this as a spare reference manual, but the Chilton's Manual is much better and way more thorough."
2,handy but not what I hoped for.,"it seams that every time I go to look in this book it tells me how to do it on a 88-95 2wd truck. when I have a 98 4wd witch is very very different, but it gives u a general idea. I have much better luck by just simply typing my question into google."
5,Happy Hauntings,The first time i read this book i could not get myself to put it down. Though i tried many times i just couldn't. This was a very creative and in many ways a very imaginative book. It was enjoyed by many people of several different age groups. Though i am a firm believer in God i see no harm in a little fun as long as people know that it is all make believe.
4,Moss - East Coast Chip Shop,"Moss' mellow debut EAST COAST CHIP SHOP has all the hallmarks of what made Pork a great label. Slow, funky beats, gentle melodies and a sense of humor. The quasi-Oriental tones and the harp intro on ""Retread Lightly"" give it a strange, dreamy quality, even as the tempo stutters slightly near the middle. ""Moth"" starts off with some scurrying percussion, while ""Skeptic Manc"" hits a more ambient groove. ""Billy Bibbit"" has a simple guitar intro that funks up soon afterwards. But other tracks go for more tried-and-true techniques: ""Apple Pie Hubbub"" is solidly standard. A nice album overall."
5,Loved this show...,"I loved this show---it was original, surprising, and uplifting. I wasn't sure I'd like it when I first saw ads for it, but once I watched it, I was hooked. This 2nd season is fun to watch, but it's bittersweet to realize that I'll never be able to see what was in store for those thoroughly enjoyable (and talented)characters. Even so, the last episode ended on a good note; with questions unanswered, to be sure, but with a confirmation that most things were going in the right direction, at least. I miss the show, but am glad I have the DVDs now to revisit the stories; it's like reading a good book again!"
5,eli stone,Loved the show when it was on the air. Glad that it came out on dvd so we can watch it again. sorry that it was canceled. K. California
4,2nd season more about relationships,"In the second season of Eli Stone, conflicts among the characters emerge, distracting from 1st season focus on Eli's visions. The courtroom and entertaining delusions take a second seat to numerous sub-plots concerning family and friends. All of the characters play larger roles, often times leaving Eli as just one of the people with problems. All in all, the 2nd season is heavier and more dramatic than the naive and quirky 1st season, but different doesn't make it worse. One could even argue that exposing flawed, complex characters add depth to the show. (I kind of preferred the archetypes of the 1st season's supporting cast.) Just be prepared for the emotional ""cliffhangers"" requiring you to watch the next episode (or next several episodes) for closure. But don't get me wrong; there is plenty of ""quirk"" left in this show. It was still one of the best shows on TV, and I will miss it dearly."
3,eli,Not as good as season 1 is seems the writers powered down for this seasonNice to see Jonny Lee Miller again
1,THIS IS AN UNAUTHORIZED STUDIO COPY!,"Unfortunately my review is not about the movie. I want to warn anyone who purchases this particular format with this picture. THIS IS NOT A AUTHORIZED STUDIO RELEASE. This is someone's Idea of making a ""homemade"" copy from a VHS tape & transferring it to DVD format. The picture, sound & quality is just too awful to go into. Do not, I repeat, Do not waste your time or money on this non authorized release."
4,A Rich Slice of Lomography,"This book is stuffed with amazing images. Some are of the mundane, others of violence, or nature, or pets, and basically anything else you can think of. However, all are inspirational to look at. I must admit I'm fairly new to lomography, but I think a seasoned lomographer would still thoroughly enjoy this book. There is so much to look at it would be hard to get tired of this book. It is pretty expensive, but if you are into lomography and have a space where you can keep this out and look at it from time to time, it's definitely worth the price."
3,"Lomo book: Don't Think, Just Shoot",Initially send me the wrong book but allowed me to keep it while sending the correct book. Book finally arrived over a month after ordering.
4,Everything you need but one,My 7 year old loved this kit to go along with her brand new microscope (along with the entire family) Only thing it was missing was the glue to adhere the top plates to make permanent slides.
5,Christmas Surprise,"We got this for our nine year old daughter for Christmas because she has a budding interest in science. We purchased the book, microscope slide kit and microscope together and are very pleased by the product and quality. The entire family has been doing experiements and love using all of the items together. A great starter kit for a child."
3,Not Great,"I pulled out the styrofoam from the box and was not impressed. It all seemed, well, cheap. With scissors, I cut away the foam slide holder from the rest. Now I've got a light-weight slide holder (could float, I suppose).Seriously, I thought there would be a bit more substance to this kit, but I realize it is relatively inexpensive. Glad I got free shipping as part of a larger order from Amazon. I wish I had tried a hobby shop first for this particular item."
5,Science aids that do the job,"My grandsons are home-schooled and this slide making kit has been a bonus in helping them explore their country woods, fields and ponds."
2,Age range?,"This is a bit too complicated for my 10 yr old daughter, but I bet next year it will be great."
2,Somewhat flimsy,"Bought to accompany microscope purchased, but had not read the details as I should have. Plastic slides work OK and I guess they are safe, but for our 12 yr. old I could have bought more serious slides -- probably good for the under 10 set."
3,Not really what I expected,I suppose I expected something a bit more quality. The slides are thick plastic and everything else is simply average. Really something for young children to play with who have scientific interests.
5,Slide making,This is a wonderful kit for the child who wants to make slides to use with a microscope. Great for children 8 or above.
4,Elenco Slide Making Kit,Bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter - to go with a microscope we bought for her. She is very in to science. She was very excited and wanted to work with it immediately. It is a great starter kit.
2,Save your money and find other sources of slide preparation,There is nothing in the kit that is worth what you may pay for it. Vague and very brief instructions. Best visit library and then internet to obtain suitable materials to make slides. You simply cannot learn to make the many types of slide and mounts from this too basic of a kit.
3,Needs reediting,"I enjoy this kit. Here are some ups and downs of this item.Ups:1-The amount of slides given.2-Magnyfing glass.3-Specimen tubes.Downs:1-NOT ENOUGH INSTRUCTIONS.I was literally lost. I didn't know what to do i think it was in-exclamatory.2-Plastic tweezers really ""that's cheap"".3-Acouple of items weren't even instructed I didn't even know what they were."
4,I should have read the discription a little closer,"This set is for kids, it's a great starter kit for kids but a little to safe for my use. Plastic twisers and plastic slides."
3,Elenco Slide Making Kit,"Received Elenco Slide Making Kit packaged with other purchases (microscope, slide box). I looked through the kit to make sure nothing was missing. Instead of 12 slide covers, there were only 7. Not sure why. Nothing was broken, though. The kit is very much for a beginner, nothing high-tech or fancy. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Beware! Journalistic hack at work,This book is nothing more than a cut -and-paste job based on the familiar accounts of duels with a few sneering comments thrown in to demonstrate the author's cleverness.The discerning reader with quickly recognize that the author is ignorant of the most basic techincal knowledge concerning the weapons she discusses. Clearly the author has not bothered to seriously research her subject--the certain mark of a journalist hack job.
1,"So, so dull.","This is a facinating subject, but Holland turns it into an incredibly boring read. While her book has some interesting historical information, one has to read through lenghty and unentertaining anecdotes to get them. Her literary style tends to be sophmoric and unpolished. Perhaps most annoying, her political bent often comes through in her writing, and it can be insulting. This is a book that I could not even bring myself to finish reading, and I cannot recommend it."
3,Dissapointed,"As a corrective massage therapist I'm looking for good pictures to show to clients so they can understand our goals. For example, I need to show how the brachial plexus can be impinged by scalenes in the neck, then by the pectoralis minor, and how that impingement affects the rest of the arm. But there are no nerves shown here. And I like to show the Psoas muscle and it's place in the hip complex, but if it's in there somewhere, there's no way to open it all up to show that. I thought it would be a fun thing to use, but it is a little too overwhelming for the office. I haven't figured out just what to do with it, yet."
2,Dissapointed,"We expected dimensional man to be well, more dimensional.My husband is a teacher and bought this as a teaching tool. This would be more useful if you could access the layers better and if it had a back view also. He doesn't have a vertebrae under his layers and the access to look at the heart is limited an awkward. There isn't a brain in the skull to view either. Over all very disappointed. Dimensional man will probably end up being a very expensive Halloween decoration."
2,My two cents - that's all this book is worth,"I have to disagree with everyone else. I found this book boring. Too many of the questions were really easy - and it's NOT because I'm too smart for the book. When you check the answers, quite a few of them indicate that 80%-100% of Mensans got the questions correct. On top of that over half the book is devoted to triva, vocabulary, and culture. With these you either know the answer or you don't - there's no intelligence involved - only familiarity.I assumed this book would entertain me for a day. I hoped it would entertain me for a weekend. Instead it bored me for a little over an hour as I took the quizzes. If you're looking for tests of logic, reasoning, and mathematics skills then this book will be of minimal interest to you."
3,Circus peanuts,"I purchased them to give as a gift since they are not the candy that I crave what-so-ever. My brother loves 'em, I hate them."
5,Loving and Hope Filled,The Wind Boy is a wonderful book that I purchased for my sons years ago and read to them several times. We loved the story and the characters and found it to always be a haven to return to at any time. I continue to read the book on occasion when this world becomes too chaotic. Ethel Cook created a wonderful place with hope for those who struggle to have what they need. She points us toward awareness of the unseen nature of so much that is worthwhile and inspired.
5,The Wind Boy,"The Wind boy is a beautiful fantasy for everyone of all ages and genders. We have one original which has been a family staple for 60 years so I am giving one to all of our extended families for Christmas to keep the legacy alive. The book was set in a war torn area and involves a family who's father is away at war. The main character is the Wind Boy. It's nice to have a ""fairy"" type character who is a boy as most of the fairy craze seems to be only for girls. With so many parents away at war right now, it is a book of hope for all. I'm so glad that it is back in print."
3,Sickly Sweet,"We read this book because we like fantasy and this came with high recommendations here and elsewhere. We generally put down books that we're not enjoying, and we did finish this one, so we did enjoy the story. However, we found it sickly sweet. My girls (who were 7 and 9 at the time) kept laughing at the overly sweet and repetitive language. I found it too cloying to be comfortable reading aloud."
5,5 star,I love this CD!! I was first introduced to Allan through Selah...love them and love him!! This is a 5 star cd and i listen to it regularly...a must get if you like selah or allan.
2,Cashel Quiet Ride Bug Armor,"In principal this is good. However bugs can get underneath, making the horse even more annoyed."
1,Matte product disappoints,"Applying product to totally dry hair still creates a somewhat shiny ""wet"" look. This is a lame matte styling creme. If you're looking for a real matte finish, go for Khiel's Creative Creme Wax or Aveda Pure-Formance Grooming Clay."
2,trying far too hard,"Im sorry, but i was really dissapointed in this film. I guess it may have been because it had been hyped up by my freinds. But if youre part of the party scene, this will leave you feeling a bit confused.I think maybe this is the american take on what the party scene is all about, looking cool, using the latest buzzwords, doing some 'cool dance moves', wearing baggy pants, did i mention looking cool? Yeck.The plasticity of this approach really turned me off, because this is not what the dance scene is all about. Its about leaving your ego behind when you go out.The film has some interesting ideas, dont get me wrong. But it looks a little contrived when comapred to 'Human traffic'(get the UK version of Human Traffic, the US version hass all drug references removed)."
5,~~~~RAVERS UNITE!~~~~~,"IF YOU HAVENT EVER RAVED, THIS MOVIE WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO TRY IT AT LEAST ONCE!...TRY EVERYTHING AT LEAST ONCE!...""LOVE IT WHILE YOU LIVE IT..."" ;p"
3,C for average,"If movies were graded like we were in grade school, this movie would get an S as in Satisfactory Effort, but a C academically. Having produced a near-accurate depiction of the rave scene is one thing, but to produce a credible film narrative is another. I can see many ravers watching this and saying, ""Ohmigod! That's us last weekend!"" but anyone interested in film as a visual novel will be bored, listless, drooling, and generally unhappy. I hoped for more. Other things to note, the background music volume on ""Groove"" is much too sedated and the rave just feels empty. For an event that features John Digweed it just feels like a Tuesday night weekly in an empty warehouse. Don't consider ""Go"" a better alternative. It'll knock you out like sleeping gas."
4,"Seen in Austin, TX","I saw this film at the Dobie in Austin, TX. It was done very well. Every second reminded me of my college days. The soundtrack on this movie is the best. I would advise buying it as well as the DVD. If you ever wanted to know what a Rave was about, you have to see this movie."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"A typical teen/early-twenties movie juxtaposing moments of characters being fun slacker caricatures, and moments where their humanity comes through. It's not about the rave scene, that's just the setting. It's about people, and the people in this slow-paced movie aren't very interesting. Their emotional issues didn't engage my interest or sympathy, and the fun scenes didn't make me wish I was there. Movies that did the same thing better include Dazed And Confused, Suburbia, Spun, The Party Monster, Empire Records, and even Go."
5,Our very special time and place,"This movie is awesome! Dmitri Ponce on the cover is my friend from childhood. Proud of him. great visual of our time in San Francisco doing our thing. Being Ravers. Absolutely the greatest 5 years of my life, and probably everyone who lived it. Thank you so much for making this film. worth every penny spent. Love, Love, Love!"
4,Excellent Look at the Underground Warehouse Party Rave Scene,While the acting in this movie leaves a bit to be desired. The set and soundtrack certainly make up for it. This movie has to be one of the most accurate portrayals of the rave scene to date. This movie does tend to play up the negatives a bit more than the positives but still ends up being a very well balanced mix of both.The movie begins with an email spreading word of a party going on that night. That email starts a flood of people all over the area getting prepared for it. We follow several sets of characters as they prepare/head to the rave. We follow the producers as they setup the equipment and decorations. We feel the anger when the Police harass them. We feel the energy and the PLUR radiating from the party. We feel the pulsating basslines of the various DJ's as this movie never skips a beat.Are you feeling it?http://www.groovethemovie.com
3,"It's Okay, has flaws though...","The thing this movie does right is throw a some what convincing party, and has a pretty good sound track(I wish the music in the movie was actually on the sound track-don't buy the soundtrack). However, they also make club goers out to be a bunch of mindless junkies. I was actually kind of embarassed to be grouped in to this catagory. I am a clubber/party goer, and we're not all drug abusing, candy sucking retards. Some of us(Most Of Us)are intelligent mature grown ups and enjoy the party for the music, not the next big high. Ya, the ""E""tards are there too, but the majority of people you find at parties are cool down to earth grown-ups, the ones you see in groove are poser wannabes."
5,Finally,"Finally someone made an accurate account of the party life in California. Not glorifying, not condemning, but real. True and well done. Character development was a bit spotty, but the interaction is perfect and the soundtrack just can't be beat. Excellent cinematography. Very well directed. GREAT set production. Wonderful all the way around!!"
3,It's just ok,"For those looking for some great movie with good acting and a great story, you should probably skip this one. This movie is ok, the music takes it from a 2-star to a 3-star. It shows very accurately what takes place in the underground rave scene and has some good parts, but like I said, you won't feel like you have really spent your time wisely. That said, I've wasted time in my life watching this quite a few times, but mostly for the music."
3,"OK movie, left me disappointed.","Overall, this movie left me disappointed. The acting left something to be desired (to put it lightly), it didn't really have a plot, and it was unsatisfying in general. There's a slight love storyline between two of the characters, but it's underdeveloped, and was probably just added to give the movie more mass appeal. The highlight of the movie by far was John Digweed's cameo, in a scene where he has a conversation with an aspiring DJ after performing a set. Sure, it gave some insight into the whole rave-underground world, and the whole party set is really cool (they have a chill room, a dance floor, a living room, a fruit and water stand, a massage room... they have an entire warehouse to work with!). ""Groove"" is worth a try, and can be entertaining at points - but if you're looking to experience a rave vicariously by watching this, that's not the way to do it-- just GO to one. Enough said."
3,"Nice Idea, Poor Execution","I liked the idea of a ""in-depth"" look into the rave scene. However, I feel that this movie sold out in several ways to cater to the pop market. The love storyline was unrealistic and obviously a marketing ploy to collect mass appeal. The music was decent when Digweed showed up, and some of the plotlines were believable, but overall I was left wanting more. A more realistic documentary is needed to further explore this mysterious realm."
2,Pointless,"Thiis movie is quite pointless. all it is about is a bunch of people trying to have fun at a rave. There is no real action and no drama. The only good thing about the movie is the music. If there is one reason to see this movie, it is to hear the music."
1,Was sent the wrong kind of DVD,I did not see anywhere on the description that this was not the correct region DVD. Very disappointed to see that I was not able to play it on my own DVD player.
3,read before you buy if you in the usa,if your in the united states and want this video then your only going to watch it in your pc or laptop cause it dose not play on dvd player ps3 or xbox...its a import and like a dumbass i didnt read the fine print lol.....its still in english and you can watch it but because its a import alot of devices wont play it only pc but you have to change the regions.... its good and clear n works fine just but always read everything.....
5,Well Glorified Night Life,Being a Person of the bay area I can watch this film and see what's real and what's not. The ravers act like we do and the parties are thrown like we'd like them to be. But the film has a kind hearted cheeziness that sadly isn't real. This is a film of night life glofied. The rave scene is sadly dying and we don't get to have the fun everyweekend that these kids do. It's a reminder of the way things were... Good Film... my favorite!
5,A movie that contains the true spirit of these parties,"This truely captures the entire rave scene before the involvement of harsh vibes. it really took me to when i first went to them. i know many other reviews said that, but back in those days, where it was all about the music, and drug usage was limited oh my god, it really entranced and rekindled my feelings for it all over again"
4,Great and accurate depiction of underground raves,"This movie is a great and pretty accurate depiction of underground raves. If you're not a techno-music fan or don't even care about raves, you'll probably find this movie pointless and superficial and you should skip it.But if you're the least open-minded, interested about what underground raves are about, you will like it. I know I did."
1,Worst movie ever,"I'll keep this short... the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, there was no plot, and no charactor development. The soundtrack, however, was pretty killer...."
3,Could be better,"I liked the acting in this movie and the storylines get off to a good start but I feel let down by the way they end. My interest grew when Colin's fiancee caught him making out with another guy and then she runs away and cries. After that you don't get to hear them speak to each other throughout the rest of the movie. I would have liked to know how their conversations went. Were they just going to forget about it? Did she accept Colin's bisexuality? Did they break up? So many unanswered questions. The scene between Colin and his brother is really confusing and pointless too. The portrayal of a rave is nicely done though, if you've never been to a rave, this movie will make you understand why you don't ever want to go. Mostly brain-dead teens on drugs mindlessly dancing to senseless music. The thing this movie doesn't show is that when the ravers grow too old to rave anymore they realize how screwed up they made their lives."
2,I don't recommend buying casebooks!,"Get a Gilbert's Law Summary on the subject and a Case Brief Book.If they do not have a Case Brief Book keyed to the casebook that you are supposed to buy, just buy any of them that you like because if the case is important enough - and shouldn't it be? - it will be in all of the Case Brief Books.If the case is that important, it is also on Wikipedia!Don't waste money on casebooks! Buy the Gilbert's and a Case Brief Book.Before you buy ANY casebook - take down the ISBN number and check the resale value of the book PRIOR to buying it... the choice of NOT buying it will be made for you!Best wishes for much success, always!"
3,Groove Diggy,"I have a bunch of these type of CDs. I like to lay around the pool and get real blown away with this stuff in the background. I normally review this kind of stuff under my other name of ""Lounge Lizard"". People that know me well, can't grasp my odd attraction to such mellow dance/downtempo stuff. I own and play acoustic folk-rock and have for 30 years and so this stuff is a general departure from where I came from. I can't even say this compilation is much different than say a mediocre Cafe Del Mar, but I have kept it moving on my CD changer, so it fills the bill. It has some nice mellow downtempo and is not overly trance/dance. Undiscovered Ibiza is my favorite so I bought this one - not as good, but good."
1,Waste of Money & Time,"This book is appropriate for those in the lumber industry, forestry managers or students at OSU in forestry/botony majors. It is a waste of time and money for those with a casual interest in trees or shrubs of Oregon. Instead, utilized Pojar & Mackinnon's ""Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast"", published by Lone Pine. In regard to Manual of Oregon Trees ... the verbage is stilted & jargon laced, illustrations are few and non-informative. The book was/is a required text for course work at OSU."
4,Look great but not for flat feet,"My son found these cleats online in effort to find metal cleats in his size. I was skeptical at first because the price seemed too good to be true.The price was great and I love the way they look, but the arch is too high for my flatfooted son. Will have to send them back, what a shame. He got a pair of Nike instead now."
3,Million worth of sad,"I watched a large part of Letters, all of Million Dollar Baby which was a sad story.I haven't finished Mystic River yet."
4,THAT IS A GREAT BOOK,That book is very educational. I liked it very much and I will recommend for my friends to buy it and read it. Good work Danticat.
4,It was a very nice journey,"The Dew Breaker turned out to be a very well thought out and very friendly journey through the inner workings of a few questions with the origin of feelings and persons. It betrayed the how many came to arrive in the United States from the tiny half island of Haiti, one of the oldest independant countries in the Western hemisphere, this was a story told backwards from the present to the distant past, when the untamed streets held different players, with very different (from us) ideals of station in life and place, I have read most of Ms. Danticat's novels and this one is by far the most adventurous. The use of language and imagery provides much of the color and accomodations for this journey, it was comfortable and enjoyable."
4,Compelling but just slightly lacking,I loved the beginning of the book. I was drawn right in my the great storytelling and unusual story but I got a little frustrated as the book began to skip around giving short vignettes of other characters - but not quite anough of any one. The end was again moving and compelling.
5,The Dew Breaker,"The Dew BreakerNot what you think it will be at first. Again, it is a lot of short stories that are all linked to one family and in particular one man who did something that he has to live with forever. He has been forgiven by his wife, but he can't forgive himself. Edwidge Danticat is one of my favorite authors. She brings you into her stories and makes you feel the intertwined stories along with her characters. Highly recommended."
3,"Love the Restaurant, wish the book was as good...","I am a regular customer at the Big Bowl in Edina, MN. It's a wonderful place, with imaginative, tasty, fresh foods. I only wish this cookbook lived up to the restaurant. Unfortunately, many of the dishes in the book are also available in almost any good Asian cooking book. The dipping sauces - my personal favorites at the restaurant - aren't included in the book and neither are my other favorites from the restaurant.I will keep going back to the restaurant, but this book is far from the next best thing to being there! Back to the kitchen..."
1,No Kung Pao Chicken,"Having visited the Chicago Big Bowl for years when I lived there, I decided I have missed my favourite dish so much, that I bought this book. Their signature dish was the Kung Pao Chicken, which I adored.I received the book today, and was absolutely amazed...there was no recipe for Kung Pao chicken, although the dish was mentioned in the preface. They do have Kung Pao Fish, but the ingredients differ greatly.Where is the recipe for the chicken!Plus, the number of photos is a token effort. Every good cook book should have photos of the dishes - this has hardly any.Too early to tell how the other recipes will shape up, but very disappointed at the moment."
1,A pseudo-science of race book,"Michael Bradley makes outrageous and unsupported statements all throughout his book.The basic thesis is that Neanderthals and their Caucasian descendants (Jews,he claims,have the most Neanderthal ancestry) are ""psychosexually maladaptive"" and ""overly agressive"".He doesn't fully explain this nor does he cite any scientific studies to lend credence to this absurdity but he tells the reader that the Neanderthal ancestry of Jews and other Caucasians accounts for the horrors of Western colonialism such as slavery and genocide.The book is entertaining though.I laughed several times reading it.When looking for Bradley's academic credentials on the cover jacket I could find nothing other than ""author"" (Hahaha!!!)....I don't recommend this book to the general public but if you have a friend who is a Physical Anthropologist,give this book as a gift to make him/her laugh out loud!"
3,Super Reader,"Another book concerned with mental states and evolution. A crash landed Mars probe brings back dirt, with a bug. This lands in Bolivia, and the state of its victims is reminscent of Incan mummy leadership rituals, so starts a small revolution.3 American astronauts are nearing Mars, so have the same issues to face. It appears the infection gives them some sort of strange religious and/or scientific insights.Generally, becoming diseased and whacky is not good for you, whether a new Incan demigod, or a now Martian biology obsessed astronaut.A little unsatisfying."
5,Your mission is to accept this dvd,"After geting season one, I could not wait for the release of season 2. The first season dvd were better than expected with great transfers of both picture and sound. The stories, of course were even better than I remembered. This is Mission Impossible, not the movies of recent times. These episodes are based on outwitting, fooling or even conning the opposition not outmuscling them. These agents use planning and stealth to achieve the mission. Of course, something will go wrong calling for improvisation and adaptation. This season marks the appearance of Peter Graves as Jim Phelps. He has a warmer screen personna than Steven Hill of the first season. These shows hold their own even after forty years. From the first note of the opening theme, you will be hooked. Action, humor and suspense delivered with great acting and writing. Do not let this set self destruct. Do not disavow this series. It is an all time classic."
4,Mission Impossible Review,"Much better than the first season. I like Steven Hill in Law & Order, but not in the IM Force.Peter Graves is a much more animated actor and brings a lot of class to the part of Mr. Phelps.The stories are realistic, but the props are, as you would expect from the 60's, a bit corny.Overall, I loved Seasons two and three.I have ordered the fourth season and can't wait to see it with the new caractors. I thought Martin Landau gave the best performance of them all, but I will give you my review of Leonard Nemoy after I watch the fourth season."
5,mission impossible season 2,good buy. this is a great buy for those that like this show. But I wish they had more cast interviews on the bonus features. It is kind of weird seeing some of the same geust stars that they had on star trek the orginal series showing up. But then this show and star trek were in production at the same time and the same lot. But the show over all it is cool to look back on the late 60's every now and agian. But you kind of have to laugh at that 60's tech compaired to todays tech. To bad that none of the orginal cast was not in any of the current Mission Impossible movies. Well at least we know that they are not going to make MI 4 anytime soon.
2,"Season two, Mission Impossible","Although the content (the shows themselves) is quit good and the video quality is excellent this was sold as new. I have my doubts. There are seven disks, all but two had defective or broken cases. When I opened disk one, tiny pieces of plastic fell out, followed by the dvd! All the little fingers which hold the dvd in the case were broken off. As I say, 5 out of the 7 cases had the same problem.As for the content the shows are great to watch again. These earlier seasons were also written before political correctness wound up influencing the shows to become weekly missions against the mob.My favorite episode ever is in season 2. It's called 'The Town'. I believe it's the only episode that did not start with the match lighting the fuse while the theme played in the background. I'm not giving away any of the plot. Buy it and watch it."
5,Awsome,I love this series when I was a kid and still do. The theme music is just something you never forget.
5,Great product!,"My husband and I are great fans of old series like Mission Impossible. We were thrilled when the first tv season came out and got it right away. Ah... It was incredible! The downside is that we watched them all too quickly and then we had to wait for the second season to come out. And it was as awesome as the first one. So for all of those MIF fans out there, don't hesitate. We are very pleased with what we got and recommend it highly."
5,Smart TV,"Long before Tom Cruise ruined Mission Impossible, making it just a special effects vehicle so he could jump around on camera without being criticized for being nuts, Mission Impossible was a great series. Each week, the thinking man could watch a story unfold. Like a murder mystery, you never quite knew how it was going to unfold in the end, except that the MI Force would win. Great casting, and a beautiful Barbara Bain helped to make this a great TV series. I remember quite a few of the best episodes, but won't go into them now. Because this message may self-destruct in 5 seconds, and Amazon will have to disavow my actions."
3,MI-OK,"This show is OK for 60s nostalga, for first time viewers, for vegging out and for its great innovation: the self-destructing tape.The fact that it is always available at the local library (and they have just one copy) is an indirect measure of public opinion.My objection is that after watching a few episodes of the show the plots seem ridiculously contrived and, well, impossible. Hmmm I wonder if itwas designed as a social satire?"
5,Great,"As Mission Impossible was one of my favorite TV programs I wanted a DVD of it, which doesn't have commercials. The quality of the picture is a lot better than my self copied VHS ones."
4,Mission Impossible TV Season 2,Anyone who was a fan of Mission Impossible when it was on TV will enjoy revisiting the series. Excellent BANG FOR THE BUCK!
5,Mission Impossible series...second season,"I liked the series as a teen, and I enjoy it even more now. The series has the movies beaten hands down."
2,Very little actual content,"I was hoping this book would provide me with a few new bits of information on what to expect on planning a wedding and maybe a little bit on married life. But, probably the most insightful advice in the book was that I would need to learn to pick my clothes off the floor before I got married...."
4,A great book,This is a great book about John's gospel with endepth commentary about the gospel. This book is essential for any John gospel studies and is great for A-Level
2,horrible product,i got this product after 16 days of ordering... hasn't worked right since i bought it... doesn't play majority of my DVD's and quits half way through the other ones... i will never buy a cyberhome again...
1,TOO BAD!!!!,"Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web. In addition, no ""all region code"" supportted! I will return it ASAP."
1,Item came in defective,"- The LCD screen didn't work- The first DVD I played (hooked up to the TV screen) stopped reading at track 7...- I returned the item to the address writen on the box, it came back because the return address is a different one, so I had to return it a second time (at my expenses of course)- Despite having nothing to do with the fact that the item was defective I only got refunded 2 thirds of the purhase price..."
1,White Shoulders Perfume,"I did not receive the item I ordered. Very dissapointed. I ordered the perfume as advertised but received cologne, big difference in the two."
5,White Shoulders By Evyan For Women. Eau De Cologne 4.5 oz,White Shoulders By Evyan For Women. Eau De Cologne 4.5 oz - I love this stuff. Wore it when I was a teenager so it's been around a long time. It stays with you all day long. RECOMMEND
2,What is pictured is not what you get...,"I ordered this because the picture shows the splash, not the spray, and I wanted the splash. What I received was the spray. I will be returning this!"
3,slow,"Other than students few need, or can use graphing calculators.Although this calculator is advertised as being useful up to and including the calculus it is best used in Pre-Algebra and Algebra I. This is a very inexpensive graphing calculator and is, thus, very slow, the screen is pretty hard to read and the instruction book not only hard to follow and very demanding but printed on paper so thin that one can read the second page through the first.After buying this calculator neither my 14 y.o. nephew nor I know just where it `fits'. He reports that its slowness yields it fairly unhelpful in class. I prefer the entry system of Hewlett Packard RPN.We conclude that this calculator is best used for simple non timed investigation of numbers and their relationships to one another as in 2 + 2 = 4A good pre algebra calculator, a pretty good algebra calculator ad for the price ... unbeatable.A good choice when calculator theft is a real possibility."
4,n,"Not that bad of a calculator. It graphs and calculate pretty good. However, It can be difficult to use because the key are confusing. Purchase with manual is better."
4,First Graphic,"I purchased mine for $49. Its suitable for any classes through college algebra. For trig you'll want to upgrade as it doesn't graph polar coordinates though it does convert rectangular to polar and back. If you needed to you could program it to input the (x,y) into a parametric graph and so display the results.While my class mates were worrying about how to get their TI's to work I was working on the problems. Even though I've moved to the Casio AFX 2.0, I keep it for a backup. When my buddy isn't borrowing it..."
2,bad decssion,product came badly damagage. I can not use the calucator for my math assignments. the front face is broken. just beautiful thanks alot.
3,Standard Bible Atlas,The product was what I expected and was informed of before I made my purchase. Used with a little obvious wear. I was satisfied.
5,I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT,"I'm giving this album 5 stars because the review below is very biased towards pop-rock. although i do listen to korn, i dont believe bands or albums should be bashed like that. Kataklysm, Hypocrisy, Six Feet Under, Shadows Fall and others have all been bashed by people who don't listen to that style of music. People who don't like Death Metal should just stay away and leave it alone. ..."
5,great death/thrash metal,"..Kataklysm is a great band, and I'm pretty sure they don't want to be on MTV! And if little 12 year olds like you start listening to bands like Kataklysm, I'd probably not listen to them!"
2,I wish Kataklysm would quit,"Kataklysm once dubbed themselves as ""Northern Hyperblast"". Now they are just about as bad as Six Feet Under.Dont bother with this unless you are into cheesy death metal."
4,Hot Toddy - Super Magic,"Chris Todd, one third of Crazy Penis, releases Super Magic under his solo moniker Hot Toddy. The mellow tracks on here belie the Crazy Penis connection, but the little touches, like the strong piano chords on ""Together,"" help the album stand on its own. ""Stratocoaster"" and ""Headlights"" bring in the funk effortlessly, while ""The Big Thang"" throws in some horns to match the whirling synths. Granted, some tracks are so smooth that they slide right off you, but there's a good time to be had here -- a chilled out time, but good nonetheless."
4,Good rack for the price but...,"I got this rack from my local Dick's sporting goods store. This was the cheapest hitch rack I could find. As some other reviewers noticed it wobbles a lot but this proved not to affect the rack's performance. I was able to attach all different kinds of bikes as well as my XC skies and ski poles.Everything was great until I went skiing in extreme cold. When I came back the straps were breaking off. I do not know if this was caused by cold or if some kid had fun with my rack. So now, out of 8 straps only 5 are functional which means I can put only two bikes on. This is the only problem I had with this rack, besides that I would efienetely recommend it. Do not spend money on brand or hype, get what's cheap and works."
4,Good buy for the Money,"We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes. It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad. It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches. It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban. We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes. It is more challenging to get the BMXs on. One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three. Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked."
2,"you get what you pay for, which in this case is not much","Ok, like most people, I got this thing because its cheap. And boy do I mean cheap.The 'strap' mechanism is four little dots that fit into 4 little holes in the straps. Yes, thats right, its the same theory as legos. There's no double tie down, there's no snappy thing, there's no bidirectional interlock mechanism, there's no nylon cloth hitch like on a bike helmet. Just 8 little plastic nubs between your bike, a big bump, and the traffic behind you getting a face full of steel tubing, gears, and spokes.If you really want to use this, I would suggest getting some rope and learning to tie a few knots. Otherwise I never really felt 'safe' just using the lego clicky connection."
4,Change from older model.,"I have had one of these for a number of years. When I purchased it, it came with completely separate parts for both the 1-1/4"" and 2"" hitch receivers. No adapter needed for the 2"". Now, it looks like it is basically the 1-1/4"" model with a shim for the 2"" receiver. My old vehicle was 2"", now I have a 1-1/4"" receiver. My problem now is that I am trying to track down parts so that it will work with the smaller receiver. [...] Now, the Saris site is displayed. For me, it has been a solid unit, but I do agree with the comments on the straps. I bungee everything and it works fine."
1,Wobbly with poor security for bikes,"I received this rack as a gift, so I didn't get to evaluate it before purchase. I have a 2"" hitch receiver. The included 2"" adapter is worthless, wobbly, and unstable. The reason is the use of nylon and loose tolerance in the adapter. Had to buy a steel adapter that fit from another vendor. Don't trust the included cheap plastic bike straps unless you want to risk losing your bikes to following traffic. Use plently of tiedowns that you provide yourself. The horizonal bars that hold the bikes are attached to the upright pipe by screw knobs that are only hand-tightened and can back out. The upright pipe is the one thing that is over-engineered and more sturdy than needed. I would strongly recommend a potential purchaser spend more money for a better carrier. It might be OK for taking a kid's bike to a neighborhood park, but that's about it."
2,Straps are flimsy,"I thought that they price was a good bargain. Until we put iton our hitch. When we tried to put two mountain bikes on the 4-hitch carrier, the straps kept popping off. They only hold tight if you have a regular moutain bike frame that probably wasmade ten or more years ago. The assembly itself wiggles a lot."
3,outback 4-bike - plastic degrades,"The metal is ""ok"" after 8 years in the sun the plastic ""cups"" are coming apart and the plastic straps have all torn off. I have resorted to bungee, or rope. The design puts too much strain on the straps. However, for the price it's ok."
3,Does not fit my 'standard' hitch,"This appears to be a pretty good hitch mount bike rack. It is sturdy and the easy to use. It is supposed to fit both 1.25 and 2"" standard hitch mounts. Unfortunately it does not fit my VW Tijuan 1.25"" hitch. It appears that the bend in the bike mount is off slightly, making it impossible to align the mounting bolt that attaches the bike rack to the hitch mount. I haven't called customer service yet, but it is frustrating that I am spending this much time on what should be a no-brainer."
2,a review,"i had to read John Bull's other island and major barbara for a literature class. i really disliked both of them. major barbara included a preface all about poverty and how the jails should be emptied. (apparently, shaw was a socialist.) it was really pretentious and he just made me really mad. the plays themselves seemed really dry and dull. i don't think this is the fault of the class because i really liked other things we read. it just seemed like the characters were really one dimentional, the social message shaw was trying to get across was the real focus of the play. i resent that. i don't read plays to be (primarily) lectured to. they were pretty unentertaining, too."
5,Fills a need,"I was using Alka-seltzer for indigestion before I got put on blood thinners, found this product with no asprin, just what I needed."
4,"fabulous stuff, but....","As other Amazon reviewers noted, the expiration date is blank on the label. But overall I am very happy with this purchase, I bought the small 4 oz lavender scent jar to try it out as I believe someone else thought the tea tree smell was too strong. I'm happy with the smell and the Shea butter, it's very moisturizing, which I need after using the African black soap. I do recommend."
5,Wonderful Folk Art Style!,The blocks in this book are beautiful! I am making the first block now. The patterns are fullsized although they overlap which makes them a little harder to trace onto freezer paper. My block is looking great and I can hardly wait to make the other eight!
4,Amazing,I really love the look of these blocks. The person who complained about the cost of enlarging the patterns has no clue that you can enlarge portions of the pattern and then tape the pieces together. It shouldn't cost $45 to enlarge the patterns! Why go to Kinkos and pay that kind of money? She must have limited resources or is just plain lazy. It's not difficult and it should not be an excuse not to buy this book. I plan to make a grouping of 3 of the blocks and hang them in my dinning room. They are all just lovely and the photos are beautiful! I haven't been so excited over a quilt book in ages. Highly recommended!!!
5,Quilting the Garden,This book is everything that I expected it to be. Barb Adams is an expert at everything she does.
1,OCD Law Students only,"The Uniform Commercial Code is a model code designed to allow the individual states to adopt those ""ghost written"" portions of contract law their legislatures are too lazy or bored to bother with.Yes, I make a living applying the UCC as it has been incorporated in Chapter 400 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, but this book is --at best--little more than a slim overview of a vast area: it is not suited to any meaningful use in a legal practice."
3,Good pocket edition but could be slightly denser,"Make sure you check exactly which sections of the UCC will be in your book. For my commercial law class, most of our citations were found in the book but for the ones that weren't he allowed us to print out any unincluded sections and bring them to the exam.Key: Make sure the portable version has what you need."
5,Toy Shmoy. It works!,"My contractor buried one of my sprinkler heads last year when he put in my patio. I finally decided to find it but didn't want to dig up 50 square feet to locate it. So I went to sears to buy a $150 detector but they only sell it online. Online means amazon to me. After reading the positive reviews I thought, Why not pop for this toy for twenty bucks? It came in two days. I went out to the back yard and yes, I found the head in 10 minutes. One little beep was all I needed. Now I'm putting it away for my granddaughter to use when she gets a bit bigger. Or until another dumb contractor buries something I need in my back yard. Hey wait, I'm going to the beach on Sunday. Hmm, maybe I'll find a rolex watch........."
1,didn't work at all,"I bought this detector as a surprise for our vacation after reading all of these positive reviews and was terribly disappointed. It didn't detect any metal except for our van...even coins that were right in front of it. I don't know if we got a defective unit, but unless the metal in question was huge and thick like a car or a metal swing set, it wouldn't beep."
5,Fun for the Family,Our grandchildren look forward to coming and finding treasure with the metal detector. We hide metal objects under carpets and other items and let them have fun.
1,Garbage!,Garbage! Will not detect a coin. Will detect a large wrench at an inch or two but not further so it works to some extent. Still might package it up & send it back but for the cost it is not worth my time.
1,Elenco Metal Detector with Beep Alert,"The unit only detects, when it is directly touching metal?! Day late and a dollar short, at that point. The Elenco Metal Detector with Beep Alert is a worthless purchase."
3,It broke soon after Santa delivered it...,"My son was so thrilled with this present on Christmas morning, ""All of my dreams came true!!"" and it worked pretty well, for about an hour. The unit wasn't mishandled, it simply stopped working (it was a constant ""beeeeep"" as if it were detecting metal everywhere). Too bad we had to ship it back to the north pole."
1,Do not buy!!,This product did not work from the beginning. It could not even detect a quarter on the ground. The product is cheaper than other detectors but pretty useless when it can not even detect coins on top of the ground. This product shouldn't even be allowed to be sold to the public. I was not expecting long range or anything considering the price but not even detecting metal above ground is ridiculous. What a great way to waste 25 bucks.
1,Metal detector is a piece of junk!!,"This metal detector is junk. It doesn't work at all and my daughter was very disappointed. Don't purchase it!! It's not worth the cost to ship it, let alone buy it."
2,Disappointing,"I thought it was a step up from another option. Very basic. Works, but not well. Some stuff we planted wasn't detected. Pretty cheap construction as well. Hopefully the kid will get some fun out of it before it breaks or is tossed aside."
1,not that good,"the metal detector just beeps at anything not anything you can do about it, like setting it to nickel gold quarter or dime. and to me it really wasnt worth it i kept finding pull tabs and caps because i couldnt set it to anything."
3,Enh,"Not a great product. It has an adjustable shaft which makes it great for varying heights and it only needs a 9V battery so seemingly easy to operate, until you realized that it beeps a pretty much everything.Got it for the 8 year old for Christmas and the thing is either too sensitive or not enough. We haven't figured out the ""sweet spot"" for the sensitivity yet...It's ok if you're kids a really little and they won't know the difference, but if they're trying to find buried treasure, look elsewhere."
1,Not worth it,"This is just not worth it, doesn't work well, I purchased this for my grandson and it was such a disappointment I don't think he really used it once because the quality was that bad."
3,NICE SIZE AND QUALITY MISSING PARTS/BAD INSTUCTIONS,"AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE I LOVE MY NEW SHOWER, CANT BEAT THE PRICE.THE PICTURE MAKES YOU BELIVE THE RISER IS INCLUDED, BUT IT IS NOT.THE OVAL RING IS TWO PIECES AND THERE ARE NO SLEEVES TO CONNECT THEM WHICH SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE MANAFACTURE.THE INSTUCTIONS ARE A JOKE.I JUST BOUGHT SOME PVC PIPE AND CONNECTED THE RING, THE SHOWER IS GOOD QUALITY AND ADJUSTABLE TO BE HUNG HIGHER OR LOWER, VERY NICE AFTER SHBATHING FOR 6 WEEKS."
4,Interesting beginning to a new trilogy,"The first thing I appreciated about this book was Ms.Litton's departure from the traditional Regency romance setting of London. Instead the majority of this novel takes place on the ficticious island nation of Akora.Lady Joanna is looking for her brother Royce who has disappeared on his voyage to Akora. Because Joanna is determined to find him she stows away aboard the ship of an Akoran prince, Alex, and arrives on the island amid controversy and speculation. It would be difficult to say more without giving away the happy ending.What's nice about this story is that although political undertones and the typical romance elements exist throughout, the characters of Joanna and Alex are well written, completely believable, and likeable as well. I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy."
4,Good start to a new series,"I'll admit it, I had high hopes for this book. I love the Atlantis idea and as I really enjoyed Josie Litton's first three books, I couldn't wait to read this one. I liked it alot but something seemed missing. Maybe the sensual tension was off? It just seemed slower moving than previous books. I didn't feel all that close to the characters but I did enjoy the story. I'm looking forward to KINGDOM OF MOONLIGHT."
2,Not worth it!,"I've read the other books written by Josie Litton: Come Back to Me, Dream of Me, and Believe In Me was a true winner. This book here? JUNK!! OK it has a decent plot and a good setting, but come on, the characters hardly spoke! The book was filled with so much unnecessary detail that it had me falling asleep on the 3rd chapter. Since I'm a reader of her books, I'd thought that the book would get better, unfortunately it didn't. I scanned throughout the whole book the way it was written still wasn't able to capture my attention. Finally returning to my reading on Chapter 3 I read again up until page 100 before I had enough of it and quit reading. After 3 attempts, I figured it wasn't worth continuing. But if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to read dialogues, this is definitely the book for you..."
4,Compelling till the end!,"The end of this book was so mind boggling that I wrestled with it in my mind for hours afterwards in a post-sixth sense kind of way. A writer that leaves that kind of impression deserves a lot of respect.Having said that, and since HK has already provided the summary (she's already reviewed every book I'm reading and thousands more, where does she get the time?) I'll just say, I would have preferred a little more closure. I'd love a sequel!! Jimmy, the 'Golden' as the govt agents call him, is a lost and confused teenager, and keeps the reader's attention because the most interesting things start happening to him. As a fan of comics, I enjoyed the way the comic book scenes were described, even though they were a bit creepy.And yes, you WILL read it in one sitting."
2,Too slow and boring,The dance routines in this DVD are too slow. My friend and I felt silly doing it and it made us want to go to sleep. Very boring. We both did not feel like we got a work out.
1,Sheila Kelley S Factor - beginning,has nothing about pole dancing so it's a little mis leading. Exotic dancing she does give you some tips. Level one means what it says.
5,Track listing,"Track Listing: God Has Done Marvelous Things Let Us Go Rejoicing Jesus, Be with Us Now Walk with Me Just a Closer Walk with Thee O Jerusalem I Will Follow You This Is the Day Share Your Bread with the Hungry Cry Out with Joy and Gladness Increase Our Faith To You, O Lord, I Lift My Soul E Na Lima Hana The Music of Creation"
5,Powerfull rock in 6o's style,"Not much to say about this great rock album from Norway. Just well played rock in 6o's style. Nothing more and nothing less for sure! If you like Rock with a capital-R, put this CD on, turn up your stereo, lean back and enjoy the great sound of vintage instruments played by people who love playing them: BigBang! (I really love Olaf's way to play the drums - and the sound!)"
3,good for big groups,I bought this to help entertain my homeschooled children along with a parachute. It is intended for big groups but seemed well written
1,The colors of the parachute DONT' MATCH with the online picture,"I am a teacher and ordered this parachute for its colors (ORANGE, PINK, yellow, green) that I could see on the online picture. What a disappointment when I openend the box! The colors are different: BLUE, RED, yellow, green!I ALREADY had a parachute with BLUE, RED, yellow & green colors and didn't need a similar one. I ordered a second parachute for the PINK and ORANGE variations!The colors of the product don't match with the online picture at all! I really feel I have been fool."
3,western,this is about my backyard or rather was filmed in my backyard down at the creek we love it at the lee creek
2,Not for most developers,"This book does not provide the level of detail that would help most Apps developers. This book is designed more for functional analysts responsible for setups, than for developers who need to understand the underlying architecture and functionalities. Most of the content of this book can easily be gathered from Oracle User Guides. This book also tries to cover too many modules, but fails to provide much detail in any areas."
3,Not for HRMS,"I purchased this book mainly for HRMS. But there is a very small section denoted for it. I think the book is ok for the other modules, but definitely not for HRMS. It also doesnt cover OTL, Self Service or OTA."
3,Nice consise intro - more useful for clients than consultants,"The scope of this book is so huge there's just no way it could be anything other than a consise intro to the major functionality of each of the modules. For me (as an Apps Consultant) it's a decorative paperweight. I never refer to it myself however this is the book I always toss to the clients when there is no budget for any training whatsoever and some poor accountant has to switch to Oracle from another ERP - it's certainly easier to understand than the help screens ;)Overall I liked it - I think the guys from BOSS did a nice job summarising the financial applications. Of course, it's getting a bit out of date now but for an accountant it's worthwhile."
2,Hollow Tree Nights and Days,Nothing like the original. Should have been told that it was just a script copy!!! No pictures and writing in play form.VERY disappointed.
3,An Old Fashioned Children's Book,"This book presents a wonderful cosmology of anthropromorphic animals living in the deep woods, their adventures, and the life lessons one might learn from these adventures. The book contains fine old ink drawings of the creatures and their habitat. This book hails from the early 1940s, so some of the tales will strike younger readers as dated or naive. Others may find the book's quaintness charming and the adventures of the denizens of the deep woods still very entertaining and worth reading."
2,"Great vocabulary, but the story...","I found this book to have the hardest vocab out of all of the sparknotes novels. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to improve their vocab.But if you're looking for a good story, I found this story horrible. Though I love vampire stories, this one had an uncomplete plot, unsolved mysterIES <- more than one, and just confusion about what the plot really was about. The author didn't really explain the conflicts of the main character - I was utterly disapointed when the author failed to elaborate more about the main character's parents.Recommended for students prepping for the SAT; but not for anyone looking for a good read."
5,Best Vampire Book-So Far,"OMG the BEST book about vampires so far. I actually just finished this second and was looking to see if it had a sequel. I just can't believe that it's over! I read it in almost none stop. I was even reading it through my music classes! IT is an AMAZING book and I just can't escape it (Even though the protagonist is incredibly stupid! Even so, it is still a great book =]) I love- LOVE it!"
5,Super Everyday Pan!,"I received this pan as a wedding gift two years ago and I have used it just about every day since then. I frequently use it for one-dish dinners and browning meats-usually sausages. It heats evenly and it can be put into the oven to keep dinner warm. I read that you could actually bake in it, but I've never tried it. The only downside to this pan is that it does not have the stay-cool handles that the commercial series does, but as long as you can remember to use your potholders, I'm sure you will love this pan just as much as I do."
5,My new favorite everyday pot,"What a workhorse in my kitchen!! Have had it for two months and we've made everything from chili to candy in it. It's the perfect size for spaghetti sauce for my small (3) family. It holds the heat for making candy. I really like the two handles -carpal tunnel prevents me from lifting any larger pot with just one hand. Handles do get hot, so use potholders. Cleans up just with a swish. I think I should probably get another one!!"
5,A great sauteuse and a great value!,"This was the second addition to my Calphalon collection. I've had it just a few months, but in that time, it's been wonderful. The weight is perfect, and it heats up quickly (I have a gas stove). Nothing burns, and clean-up is a breeze. Due to the shallow size, water boils fast, and it can be used for boiling small amounts of pasta, rice, or cubed potatoes.This sauteuse is perfect for sauteing chicken pieces, vegetables or creating a medium-sized pot of marinara sauce.There is absolutely nothing I don't love about this pan, and I highly recommend it!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"My first use for this pot was a batch of chili. It cooked very well, using low heat, and the chili didn't stick. However...every time I wanted to check and stir the chili, the pot spun around like no pot I have ever used. I had to keep a firm grip on one handle (using a double pot holder to keep from getting my hand burned). My range is electric with a ceramic top. My husband was observing me and asked why the pot kept spinning like that. It should probably be used only on gas ranges, but that doesn't help me any. The second problem I encountered was that the inside of the lid developed several dark stains which no amount of my cleaning could remove. The pot itself, however, cleaned very well."
2,"Questionable design, handles get very hot","Photo looks very appealing. Upon using it for the first and only time, these issues crop up:1. The bottom is not perfectly flat, so it does not sit flat on my radiant cooktop, and spins around. (This will not apply to a gas range or a ring-top range).2. The metal handles get as hot as the pan, so using a handle to hold it steady is not a bare-handed task. You need to keep a potholder handy, and if you are cooking more than one or two items, the potholder comes in the way, in addition to risking falling into another pot! Wonder what they were thinking of to put metal handles; the non-metal ones would have been so much more useful.I returned mine."
2,Cheap metal & wrong pic?,"Well. I have had this pot since 2003 and it's one of those pans you don't use much. The metal is so cheap and thin...like the customers said..it spun!! betcha can't do that with cast iron!!! I'm a serious cook and I use pots and pans EVERYDAY. This one is not dependable. Cleanup is difficult, it really sticks..everything that is and I noticed some rust as well....Ahhhhhhhh..what can I say..There is a reason that I switched to good ol'cast iron. I don't wanna change my pans every two years..!!!!!Oh and the lid in this picture is differant than the one I received???Calphalon should stop selling cheap products like such..UGH!!"
2,Needed more spice,"""Delicious"" this was not; it's not horrible, but it's not very good, either -- just blah. I liked Penny a lot: ambitious, spunky, passionate -- but the story behind Cal's lack of love in their previous marriage was just not appealing. I, too, wondered how, after he had so broken her heart, that she would immediately jump into bed with him and fall all over again. I did not, for a minute, think that he had changed so much that he really loved Penny.Ironically, the best thing about this book was the descriptions of the restaurant business and the hustle and bustle of working daily in such a fast-paced environment.The next book in this series, ""Irresistible"" is even less compelling than this one. Yawn. I don't even care to finish Book 3 and 4. After slogging through the first three Marcelli Sisters trilogy, I'm pretty much finished with Susan Mallery. I just don't find her writing very interesting."
3,Delicious left me still hungry!,"I love Susan Mallery's work and looked forward reading her latest. Cal and Penny's second chance at love was an immediate draw for me. However, as I read their story I experienced their reconnection through the ""telling"" of their story but had a hard time ""feeling"" the connection. Even their love scenes were missing the special ""afterglow"" elements. I enjoyed the secondary characters and will give Ms. Mallery another chance by reading another Buchanan story. This one just left me wanting. Even the ending was less than satisfying."
5,Another Winner,'Delicious' by Susan Mallery is another fun humourous romance novel. I love happy ending and this story reunites an ex-husband and wife. Cal and Penny have been divorced for three years. He needs help with his new restaurant and Penny is the perfect solution to his problems. Cal has a lot of secrets and Penny has one big secret ~ she is pregnant. The support characters also wonderful I hope Susan Mallery explores those stories next. I would also suggest Falling For Gracie by Susan Mallery.
2,Delicious! unappetizing...,"Wow, talk about a dysfunctional family! I found this family and their friends to be shallow and superficial characters. I never got a real sense of warmth or connection between them. I was very disappointed and skipped from the middle of the book through to the end. Even the ending leaves a lot to be desired. I am surprised this book received such favorable reviews. Sorry, I won't be going back for the next course in this dining experience."
2,Wanted to love it but......,"Cal Buchanan needs some help and the only person that can help him is Penny Jackson, his ex-wife. Cal and Penny are working together, but she is keep a secret from, she is going have baby. Cal and Penny didn't work the first time but maybe they can the second time.Okay I really wanted to like ""Delicious"" by Susan Mallery, but I could get pass what poor character Cal was! He was the most self-center character that I have seen in a very long. I have the other books in the ""Buchanan"" series, so I am hoping that it will get better."
1,Title should have been Dysfunctional -,not Delicious. Everyone in this family needs help. If you're looking to be an amateur Dr. Phil this is for you - otherwise don't waste your money.
1,Terrible!,"I really like Susan Mallery, but this is a terrible book. The heroine is pathetic - a glutton for punishment. The ""hero"" is a first-class creep. And, the supporting characters are not particularly likeable. Save your time and money and skip this one."
3,A Good Solid Romance Story,Enjoyable tale of renewed love between a divorced couple. The next 2 books in the series are better.
4,Awesome book,This is the first book I've read written by Susan mallery and I can say it won't be the last! It was very well written & I literally had to read this book In a day and half because I couldn't put it down. I was intrigued by the characters & their stories. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
3,Very Good,I really enjoyed reading this book.It's great to read a continuity and see what and how things take placein a family and the dynamics involved.
2,too small,"read the reviews of the yellow version. Decided to try them anyway since they are inexpensive. I can push them onto a standard closet pole, but they don't move along the pole. The hanger hook measures 1 1/4 inch diameter- too small for standard closet."
3,Worst DVD Quality I've ever seen,"It looks like it was copied from a very old VHS tape. Lots of lines running through it, and horrible splicing in places. I guess for $4.99, you get what you pay for. What made it worse was that you could tell at one time the original must have been awesome. Other than the DVD quality, the movie was good..though not my favorite version."
4,Proficient Version of JANE EYRE,"George C. Scott is wonderful as Rochester while Susannah York is capable and satisfactory in the title role yet she seems to lack some passion inward or outward. Jack Hawkins is brilliant as the evil headmaster yet the motivations for his hideous nature are left unexplored. This version of JANE EYRE is beautifully photographed and richly textured and very compelling. John William's score is appropriately composed to augment the visuals. In all this is a well intentioned production but seems to lack some of the mysterious and enigmatic qualities of earlier versions, yet it is still very enthralling."
2,Old TV Movie on DVD....looks like it,"I've always loved this version and was delighted to be able to purchase it on DVD. However, the quality is extremely poor. It looks like it was taped off an old television set. There are skips in it, scratchy sound and lines that wiggle across the screen like an old home movie. And yet, I am happy to have it. They never play it anymore on television and I really do like the story. I just wish it was in better shape. At least the price was right!"
2,"Sorry, but Timothy Dalton will always be Edward Fairfax Rochester to me!","I can't help but see this film as ""Scrooge"" playing Mr. Rochester, and quite frankly, that will never do. Not a favorite, but I'm glad to have added yet another twist on Jane Eyre into my collection."
5,Buy this one!,If you like Jane Eyre then this one is a must. I have seen other versions of this movie but this one is the best.
2,Not the best version of Jane Eyre,"This version of Jane Eyre was not the best. First, I had the distinct impression that George C. Scott played himself. He really did not get the essence of the character that he played.Second, the movie seemed more like a remake of the Orson Welles version than a fresh telling of the story. Many of the elements of this one were clearly taken from the Welles version.Overall, if I had to choose a version of this story, I would probably take the Timothy Dalton version, which although the male lead may not look the part, is the truest version to the novel in terms of acting and atmosphere.This one was ok, but only just."
2,bad quality,"I was looking forward to seeing this, but the quality is so bad ( both audio and video) that it makes this waste of my money and time."
3,ok,After viewing I like this movie however it is not a true Jane Erye by the book It is a sweet love story!
2,poor quality,"i purchased this version of the movie because i had bought a $1 dvd of jane eyre. the cheaper dvd had some missing scenes, and i came across this dvd. i bought it, and the quality is so much worse than the cheaper dvd. i'd rather watch the cheaper dvd with the missing scene than to have to watch the poor quality of this dumb thing. if i had watched it before i threw away the receipt, i would have returned it immediately."
4,Enthralling and Rich Production,"Delbert Mann's direction is somewhat pedestrian but the cast and visuals more than compensate his static approach. George C. Scott is wonderful as Rochester while Susannah York is capable and satisfactory in the title role (Jane Eyre) yet she seems to lack some passion either from an inward or outward perspective. Jack Hawkins is brilliant as the malevolent headmaster. However, the motivations for his hideous nature are left unexplored. This version of JANE EYRE is beautifully photographed and richly textured and very compelling. John William's score is very British and appropriately composed to augment the visuals. In all this is a well intentioned and splendid production but seems to lack some of the mysterious and enigmatic qualities of earlier versions. Yet it is still very enthralling."
5,"Best version of ""Jane Eyre"" to date","I've seen all the versions of ""Jane Eyre"" made to date, and this remains my favorite, primarily because George C. Scott is the perfect Rochester (though Scott's biographer, W. A Harbinson, dismissed the film as ordinary). Both he and Susannah York invest their characters with passion without resorting to histrionics. The score by John Williams is one of his early efforts before he attained fame, and it remains one of my favorites.The movie was filmed in Yorkshire, and on its original telecast the beauty of the Yorkshire moors was evident. Subsequent transfers to VHS and DVD have been atrocious and resulted in a dark, grainy film. Nevertheless, I return to this again and again for its superior performances."
4,Flawed but best Jane Eyre production,"While other renditions of this story may be more faithful to the book in completeness, this one captures the spirit and Passion of the book better than any of the other major productions I've seen. The British versions, while competently acted and longer, are a little flat. I have to alert you, however, to the DVD version of this George C. Scott and Suzanna York movie. At least 2 new copies that I've had to return to Amazon are missing over 4 minutes of crucial dialogue between Rochester and Jane in their second conversation by the fireside (about 30 minutes into the DVD). There may be a limited number of these flawed DVD's, but I was not willing to take a third chance. The VHS version does not have this problem."
4,My favorite Jane Eyre version.,"I saw this version of Jane Eyre in China when I was a teenager in early 80's. I had read the book by then and was overwhelmed by the great performance of George Scott and Susannah York. I felt that they played Rochester and Jane just as exactly as I imagined. The music score was great throughout and it truly expressed the spirit of the characters and the story. I have never forgot the main theme for the past twenty some years. This is one of my all time favorite films.However, I have to say that the DVD quality is terrible. At least two scenes are missing in the DVD version. The pictures are too dark and blurred. What a pity!But, no matter what, I still love this version of Jane Eyre."
1,Bad Edit?,"Maybe it's just because of the horrific DVD edit but I really don't understand why other reviewers are calling this a ""gem"". I had no idea why Jane would fall in love with this Rochester (Maybe because she's in her 40's?). Maybe all those scenes got cut out. This St. John Rivers doesn't strike me as an idealistic man of God, he acts crazed and fanatical! York is too old and too pretty. Scott is at least old and grouchy but he does poorly looking tortured. The scene at the end is puzzling, Scott as Rochester is flippant and emotionless (maybe he used up his histrionics in the rest of the movie) There are so many good versions of this, this one seems like a waste of time."
1,STRANGE,"This film version of Jane Eyre has turned Charlotte Bronte's gothic novel into an episode of the Twilight Zone, evidenced by degenerative dialogue, a raucous musical score and unimpressive photography. The underlying themes of the necessity of faith and moral integrity in Bronte's novel has been transformed into humanitarian ethic, and the love between Edward and Jane which encompasses body, mind and soul, in this film has none of the passion found in the novel."
1,Stunted Performances Create a Void in the Story,"If you love the story of Jane Eyre, this version is not for you. The performances are lacking, and the screenwriter made too many changes to the plot. If you absolutely have to see it, find somewhere to rent it, but don't waste your money on a purchase. The A&E, Zeffirelli and BBC versions far outshine this film."
1,poor editing poor production,"This was very dissapointing to me. I love George C Scott, but he seemed very bored and harsh and angry playing the tragic Mr Rochester. He looked like playing Patton playing Rochester.Suzanna York hardly looked like an 18 year old the 1970s makeup didn't help and played a very cold and calculating Jane.The edits are most horrible.... film is faded. It is very dated when viewing it.I do not recommend it . Instead watch Timothy Daltons or Orson Wells version. All have Brilliant acting and feeling. Unfortunately I give George C Scoott and Suzanna York a big Thumbs down. Especially the poor miscassed Suzanna for being much too old for the role"
2,Chopped and grainy DVD copy--stick to the VHS version!,"I was thrilled to find the George C. Scott/Susannah York version of ""Jane Eyre"" released on DVD. The VHS version was perfect so I expected the DVD to be just as spectacular, if not better.I was terribly disappointed to find first that the picture quality showed it was obviously transferred from a worn film print and then horrified to find scenes actually chopped to bits!This DVD will be going in the give-away pile, unfortunately.In the meantime I'm hanging on to my VHS copy until someone whoknows what they're doing puts a decent copy to DVD!"
4,Please Release a New Unedited DVD!,This is the Jane Eyre movie that starred George C. Scott as Mr. Rochester and I think it needs to be pointed out that some reviewers seem to think that the movie itself was filmed the way you see it on this DVD and it was always badly edited but I take the advice of the reviewers who were old enough to have seen the original airings back in the early 1970's that it actually contained more scenes and that for some reason some scenes have been edited on the DVD releases and that is really a shame because George C. Scott is a superb actor and I can totally invision him as Rochester because he is a talanted actor and also because of his macho tough guy image and deep rough voice and I think someone needs to put out a good DVD release and put back in what was taken out.
3,Jane errored....,"As much as I am pleased I finally found George C. Scott's version of this novel/movie, I am so unhappy with the quality of editing and the horrendous film quality of this DVD! I find it hard to believe someone released it as it is! I saw the original version on TV years ago. I have never been able to forget it! The acting is first class, the music is to die for, (I have the LP for the sound track). But, after years of searching for a DVD of this TV movie, I was horror struck at how dark the scenes were, and how poor the audio was. It looks like someone has made multiple copies of it over and over so now you have little viewing quality left and then decided to sell it in this DVD form. Luckily, Scott and York still give brilliant performances in spite of how the DVD was produced. The movie's music theme still haunts me decades after first hearing it!"
3,DVD quality,"All in all, a good version of the story (George C. Scott is a great Rochester). Unfortunately, the DVD quality is extremely poor."
2,Don't Bother!,"Don't bother unless you can't find the version with Timothy Dalton. I watched that version first. Then this one. This one was so poorly done in comparison that I got up and mopped the kitchen floor while it played and fast forwarded through the non-talking scenes. While the acting was good enough, the script leaves too much unsaid. It is difficult to see why the two main characters would bother falling in love with each other. The plot just wasn't developed enough to warrant it. So many key parts of the story are missing. I highly recommend the version with Timothy Dalton and Zetah Clarke instead"
3,The best film version about Jane Eyre,"I saw this film when I was only seven years old.I really don't know why I am so fond of this film,such as its music and the two great movie stars: George C. Scott and Miss York.And I think this is the best movie about this classical English novel by Charlotte Bronte.Many friends around me also love it to death."
5,Delight,Jane Eyre has always been one of my favorite movies and the George C. Scott version proves to be the best. I love itI was surprised how quickly I received my copy. The price was surprisingly reasonable. It arrived in excellentcondition. I will be purchasing more hard-to-find DVD's in the future.
2,Could've been better,"This ""White Trash"" box set really doesn't have anything new to offer to hardcore Manson fans. The content in disk one are the same tracks you will find on their ""Birth of the Antichrist"" CD (which is renamed ""My Monkey"" for the box set). The second disk is the same situation, the content on this disk are the same tracks you would find on their live CD called ""Live"" (which is renamed ""Cyclopse Live"" for the box set) plus the same flaws on the ""Live"" CD are in the second disk as well, which some of the songs don't match the order of the track listing. What really hurts this set is the fact that nothing in this set brings anything new to Manson fans and the poor sound quality isn't improved. This set could've been better if there was rare and unreleased material from the Marilyn Manson and the spooky kids era instesd of the same stuff all over again. I recomend getting Manson's ""Lunch Boxes & Choklit Cows"" CD over this box set."
4,Good Guys vs Bad Guys,"I gave this a four for what it is to me; it's like a cowboy comic book. Like a lot of Johnstone's novels,they are very exciting, quick reads, and they are always good vs evil with good winning. I was always a fan of Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Maverick, etc and even though I know that the good guys never die and will always win, I tuned in every week to watch anyways."
4,Easy read,"These books that are writen but the author are fun and easy to read, you can escape for a few hours, I recomend them very much, this a good flowing book. Helps you pass away hours in fun reading."
3,biographies on who?,"Among those featured are Malcolm Campbell, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, W. Randolph Hearst, Florenz Ziegfeld, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Clyde Beatty, J.P. Morgan, Benito Mussolini, Billy Sunday, Somerset Maugham, Clarence Darrow, The Mayo Brothers, Eddie Rickenbacker, Helen Keller, Enrico Caruso, Theodore Roosevelt, Jack London, W. C. Fields, Al Jolson, Mary Pickford, Charles Dickens, Katherine Hepburn and many more.(...)"
4,Very Cute,I purchased this shoe for my granddaughter and was more than pleased when they arrived. I was looking for something a little different but not over the top and this fit the bill completely. The leather is very soft so if your child is rough on shoes this may not be for you. Although this has not proven to be a problem I can see where the leather could scuff easily. For me they work and I will order again. I believe my granddaughter loves them as much as I do.:-)
3,"Great Looking, Comfortable, but does not hold up","this is a great shoe! do not get me wrong, it is flexible which is good for a growing foot, it is also absolutely adorable! It just does not hold up. I bought these shoes for my daughter less than 3 months ago, and she has managed to wear them out by dragging her feet in them. The stitchery does not stay stitched with heavy duty wear and tear as many toddlers are know for. I would buy them again, except they are a bit expensive, and for that price, they should hold up to the demands and stress put on them by toddlers."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE - BE CAREFUL TO BUY THE RIGHT SIZE!!,"I bought a pair of these shoes but they shipped the wrong size and when I asked if I could exchange, the person, Steve at the company said I could. I send the shoes back and have left several messages/emails over a number of weeks but they have not responded back at all. So if you want to buy, then make sure it's the correct size since some manufacturer's sizes are a little off and you'll have no chance of returning/exchanging."
3,Nice soft soled shoes for early walkers,We bought these shoes for my daughter as a follow up to her first pediped soft soled shoes. We needed a little more protection and durability for walking outside.The soles are a very soft rubber and very flexible. I think they are great for beginning walkers. The only reason I gave these a 3 is because the leather on the ridges around the stitching scuffed badly and immediately. So they looked pretty tattered after just one wear.You can't beat the price though! All-in-all a good value.
2,Not so happy,"I was disappointed with this. When you look inside, the finishing is so bad that you would see pieces of the material hanging. As an adult, even a little stitch hurts and can't imagen all that extra material on those little feet. Rather pay more and get the Livie & Luca brand."
4,Lovely!!!,"This shoe is absolutely gorgeous on my daughter's feet. My only problem is that it fits a bit close. She still wears 6 in some shoes comfortably, so I bought the 7 and they just fit. Dont think she will have a lot of wear out of it but I would definitely buy another if it gets too close."
3,Shoes are cute but...,The shoes are really cute but they do not look as though they are made with quality materials. The shoes look glued together.It also took a very long time to get them. I was given a specific date and received them a week later that was maddening.
4,love these shoes...,We simply love these shoes. they are so comfortable for my little one. It has the right amount of support so she doesnt wobble too much and is soft enough that she isnt uncomfortable in them. The only reason I gave a 4 star is the sizing. I wish they were more accurate. I had to buy another one as the first one ended up being too small...
3,Uneven storytelling,"Most of C. Bard Cole's stories read like outlines for stories he seems unwilling to have written more artfully. Still, at times even these outlines can present very moving glimpses at the lives of outcasts. Cole works best when he writes clear, fast moving descriptions of his characters and uses minimal dialogue. Too often with Cole, one is reminded how often he breaks the Creative Writing Rule 101: ""show it, don't tell it."" As a published writer, he should be beyond that. The last story in the book is the longest and most disappointing. It displays the worst of Cole's dialogue, which is not his strongest talent even in his best stories, and lacks the power of the earlier, fast moving pieces. Despite its shortcomings, ""Briefly Told Lives"" is worth reading for those strong moments. Just wait for the paperback."
4,Viva Garcia Lorca,Outstanding performance. The adaptation of this master piece is admirable.Antonio and Cristina at there best. To bad that the sound feedback ruins the silent moments. But those were the resources in the Spain of the 80s.Other than that I would give it a five star.
5,Great early recording.....gotta have it for your collection,"I had this recording years ago, and have been searching for it since I loaned it to a friend (but can't remember which one). It is a great early Dirt Band recording that didn't get nearly as much attention as it deserved. Get this one for your collection"
2,This book is in poor condition.,I really don't like to leave a negative comment but I buy a lot of books from Amazon and I would rate this in poor condition not good. The outside cover is torn from the spine and the pages are tan and have a very old stain splashed out all over them. I think this is the saddest looking used book that I have ever purchased. It isn't what is shown in the picture either.
5,"An intriging, mysterious book.",This book is fabulous. This is one of my favorite Trixie Belden books
4,Denver Delights!,I recently watched the Wildlife Concert on Public TV and bought the CD. I have been a John Denver fan since the early 1970's and have many of his original albums. The Wildlife Concert is compendium of many of his classic songs from the early years till more present times before his untimely death. The melodies and his voice evoke many memories of time I had spent in the Rocky Mountains. The only distracting part is the chatter and applause between songs.
5,Wildlife Concert,"As usual, product from Amazon received in perfect condition in timely manner. Thanks. I like shopping at Amazon."
3,A sonic mixed bag,"I take exception to the reviews that say this disc has excellent sound. Perhaps heard through a fifty dollar walkman cd player through ten dollar ear-bud headphones this disc sounds pleasant but through my high fidelty system it sounds muffled, constipated and lacking in bass richness. This is most evident in the Mouvement which starts out sounding like it's recoded in a cave then later sounding like the mike is only a foot away from the piano.The Etudes fare somewhat better sonically. The performance is good in that Mr. Aimard allows Debussy's work to speak for itself. Not recommended for audio buffs though."
5,Really good business book,"This is a good business book for people who hate biz books or for those who are tired of lousy ones. Very readible,incredibly funny and very useful. Should make you some money."
4,"Great Album, UPGRADED with an extra track","This is still a great album, and I agree with the reviews (you do not need to know Italian to enjoy their musica).However, this is a re-release of the album. The CD that I purchased a few years ago had 12 tracks. This one has 13. The Samba remix of Festival was added.My advice to those who bought the original version of Festival: Download track 13, the Samba remix. You will enjoy it!"
5,GREAT SHOW,"This is one of the best doctor-murder shows of all time. In this season watch Dr. Sloane, go through car troubles and getting his rental car blown up, watch Amanda lose all of her money and Jack trying to get it back for her (and actually does!!!!), Dr. Sloane get accused of murder, and also get locked in a Emergency Room with happy gas, and arrest a girl for muurder, going to court TWICE, without double jepordy. This show is a down heart, good show.Although it is mainly about murders and the sick, Dick Van Dykes character will make you laugh. The show stars Dick Van Dyke (Dr. Mark Sloane), Barry Van Dyke (Lt. Steve Sloane), Scott Baio (Dr. Jack Stewart) and Victoria Rowell (Amanda Bentley) Hope this review was helpfull!!!!"
5,great,great dvd series i like dick in these shows and his son too i think they are good working together very good series
5,The BEST Halloween book I've ever read!,"As a teacher of pre-k to 1st grade this book is a MUST have for every classroom, and will be loved at home too. I bought multiple copies because everyone wants to have it in their book box after using it as a read-aloud, and it gets very worn from just one year's use. The author's ""voice"" in this book is excellent. The kids love to turn the lights off and have me use my ""spooky night time voice"". I have never had a child be scared from the book. Their are lots of opportunities to use the comprehension strategies when reading this book and know that kids throughout elementary school love this book! It was so well liked that kids were requesting it for a read aloud all year."
3,neat but disappointing,"I bought this book because I love Eve Bunting's work. The words are rich and the illustrations are wonderful. However, I do not feel comfortable reading this to my preschool classes because of the ending. Just as you are starting to feel comfortable with the skeleton not being real she shows a possible gravesite and the skeleton is missing by the end of the book, as though it came to life and escaped and/or ""died"". While I am not concerned about some scariness in books, this one takes you by surprise and may be a little too open-ended for the younger children."
3,disappointing and overpriced,"If design were everything, this beautiful Cross pen would be a prizewinner. From its streamlined clip which sinks into the barrel when not in use, to the huge gold nib, this pen is a looker. That being said, the metal barrel is a bit tinny, and overall the pen is bit lighter in the hand than I prefer. Worst of all is the horrible quality of writing. It skips and consistently needs a downstroke to start ink flowing when writing. I'm quite disappointed in Cross for this pen. It has joined my Sheaffer Intrigue in the pile needing nib attention right out of the box. This pen is too expensive for such poor quality control."
3,Rust pans,I love the cookie rack but the pans rusted & are NOT nonstick.I would have thought being Calphalon I would not have rust & would be nonstick.I wish I would have bought the cookie rack & not the pans
5,Wonderful movie!,"My 18 month old daughter watches ""The First Christmas"" on this DVD every day. The 20 minute show is so sweet and a GREAT depiction of the true Christmas story. And a great find for a low price!"
5,I've had this trap for 20 hours,"I live in central Florida near the coast. The past couple of days the mosquitos have been BAD!!! I put this trap together yesterday and put it out in the afternoon...only caught about 20 mosquitos in a couple of hours. However, once the sun went down, the flashing LED and CO2 attracted a BUNCH of mosquitos. I've had the trap up now about 24 hours and have probably caught 500-700 mosquitos...about 70% of those caught though are on the sticky tack-strip that encircles the unit, not in the catch basket. The trap is still under some shady trees in the side yard and everytime I check (in the early morning-afternoon...10-11 a.m.) there are about 5-10 mosquitos flying around it. So, I'll leave it on during the day. But I think the damage is done at night. I hope the motor/fan hold up. I've read a couple of reviews where they die in a couple of months. I'll find out soon enough."
1,SKEETER VAC REPAIR,"If you are frustrated with your skeeter vac because of its not starting or running poorly, it can be repaired. Please email me at Gkconst@comcast.net. I can let you know a way to get your machine up and running rather than filling up the landfill. Thanks Gregg"
4,extremely addictive,great story line with sum great twists.Mix in a little mythology and sum great action.this book is fantastic the book develops well and doesn't drag out ounce you have read it you will really see how many people have tried to copy it!
2,"I hear no evil, just bad sound","Recently I bought the entire collection of 3 DVD and I was delightfully surprised of the fast deliver (I'm living in Michoacan, Mexico) BUT my joy soon gone after viewing some episodes because the poor quality (volume) of sound. I tried on a regular dvd player that plays region 1 and 2. Then I tried on my lap with the same result, until I played it with the Windows Media Center that I get a decent sound volume. Besides, the discs look like a regular (home made) copy, with the dark blue surface very much alike with those Sony discs. The only thing that make these ""original"" is the label print. I thought that I could get a better product getting it through the legal way but with these results next time I'm going to get my stuff on a different ""bay"" where the pirates dock."
3,Allegory still relevant?,"Lawrence's last novel describes a resuscitated Christ carrying his wounds and meeting old friends. He does not want them to touch him. He needs to move away from this life. He wanders onto the property of a priestess of Isis. She believes him to be Osiris and she is to heal his wounds and bear a child with him. This is how Christ leaves behind his body and blood. The erotic interplay between Christ and the priestess evokes in him a revelation that this is the mystery of life that the Father has not allowed him to experience. In Lawrence's day, the demythologizing of Christ and the erotic interplay underline incarnation. Today it seems a bit much. Forcing Christ into sexual liaisions betrays an emphasis on an erotic gnosticism apparent in contemporary ""spiritual"" movements. But at the time this novel was written, it may have had some relevance in challenging mystical applications of the Christ myth. The writing is beautiful."
5,Cryptically stunning.,"The first time that I read this story was close to 10 years ago and it was coupled with another short titled, ""Bryn Mawr"" (sp). Being a fan of Kazantzakis, I was immedeiatly drawn into this speculative account. I couldn't put it down even when it ended. The best of this style and subject."
2,Terrible,"As most of the other reviewers, I have found this book seriously lacking in editorial professionalism. Missing code, chapters/sections out of order (ie, project 1, fix the input validation on a form in chapter 9, and create the form in chapter 10! Yes, it is that bad)To push a book this bad on a public that's attempting to educate themselves is nothing short of a sin.After visiting Premier's web site, there is no errata, nothing at all (except to download the example code).Avoid this one!G"
2,Not Professional Grade,"That's great that the other reviewer got a lot out of this book, but unfortunately I didn't. The projects are not anything near professional grade in my opinion. For example, in the first project the code in the UI makes lots of calls to the database directly. From the title, I felt that a real-world distributed application using a data access layer and maybe even a web services layer would have been more appropriate. Also, the user interface design throughout the projects is non-standard and quite hokey in my opinion. I'm usually not that critical about the application architecture and UI design in the case studies presented in a book, but when the title is ""Professional Projects"" I believe the bar should be raised a lot higher. I would recommend the IBuySpy Developer Solution Kits that are free from Microsoft over this book. ..."
2,Missing Codes and Inconsistent steps,"There are lots of missing codes compounded with the absence of an errata or support. Unlike other publishers (for example, WROX), the authors/publishers do not give you any support.I followed the steps religiously, and in almost every occassion, the programs will spit out lots of error messages. Although not recommended by the authors, you need a strong handle in Java and or C in order to use this book.The architechtual and UI design concepts need improvement. For someone who is well versed with N-Tier apps, I just find these projects lacking."
1,Real bad book,"I bought the spanish version and it's realy a loss of time and money, the book's title isn't correct, should be ""C# play a little"", the book content seems to be copy/pasted from somewhere else."
1,Horrible,"Pretty horrible book. Agree with most of the reviewers, unanimously. Authors must have been in one of those ""low quality"" outsourcing shops. Although, probably out of context, authors and the publishing house should take a look at [...], for a classic example of how a technical book should be written especially it is claiming to cover ""real life"" projects."
1,Terrible book!,"Avoid at all costs. The book was written in 2002 and is not compatible with the latest versions of Visual Studio.The companion website is no longer available, so downloading the databases used in the projects is impossible as is downloading the source code. Stay away from Premier Press books for this reason.I am so grateful I didn't buy this book, it was a ""gift"" from my C# professor in college. As others have mentioned, it is poorly edited and missing important details."
4,First Book,I thought the first book by this auther was well done..IT kept my interest throughout...I would read another in a heartbeat!Great Job!
2,"Watch out! Great book, but this edition is abridged.","Everyone interested in economics should read this book, but this abridged edition excludes Books 4 and 6 and some interesting appendices."
5,The Porcupine edition is NOT ABRIDGED!,"The other review on this page is incorrect! It's a cut-and-paste job from a review of the Great Minds edition, which is abridged. The porcupine edition is NOT ABRIDGED. If you are reading Marshall's principles for the first time, or if you want a copy for reference, this is the edition you want to buy. I don't know who is responsible for the cutting-and-pasting, but this error should be corrected right away."
3,Amazing that this was the standard for economic textbooks,"This books which dates to the late 1800's was the standard for textbooks in economic classes for many years. If you choose to read this book, be prepared to dig deep for interesting economic principles and takeaways. It's not a very difficult book to read but the author's writing style is very informal and loose along with the fact you have to get through the amazing quantity of words to find any value. The author's style is like a long winded professor talking to a class without any real point. I did enjoy the second half of the book more than the first as it seemed to have a point. As a student of economics I have to respect the early traditions and books and that's why I read this. In summary, it's a classic so you must read it but it won't change your life."
4,"Very good, but","The performance is perfect from people who are used to work together (the soprano is married to the conductor). The Figueras/Savall/Capella Reial combination has produced several masterpieces of music from these age. This one is up to their standard of excellency.BUT, the pieces are simply not as good as their first Canto de la Sibila record. If like me you bought the first before the second, the latter will always be a little disapointing.If you don't own the first yet, start with this one and then move on their first record."
5,Incredible,"The music on this CD is beautiful beyond words. A lone soprano and chorus sings prays to the Virgin Mary to implore her to quell the wrath of Jesus' wrathful judgement.Soprano: On that day, when he becomes most wrathful, remind himhow he was shut up inside you.Chorus: Mother of God, intercede for us with your son at that hour.The instumentation is very sparce, and some may find the music repetitious, but I enjoyed every minute of it."
5,Excellent Chess Book!,"This book is excellent! It is expensive but worth every penny! It would have been nice if it included some rare photos but this is very minor. Even if you own other works of Alekhine's this is still a good book to have because of it's completeness. The publisher has other chess books of this quality on chess masters such as Capablanca, Marshall, Steinitz and Reshevsky."
5,I was Turned 'Inside Out',"I am not gay nor am I a woman, so when friends told me I had to read ""Inside Out"" by Juliet Carrera I was a bit skeptical. It took me awhile to get around to it, but I eventually started it and simply couldn't put it down. Quite frankly it is a good love story: smart, sexy and extremely compelling. I really wanted to know what was going to happen to all the characters. I especially enjoyed the twisted tricks the congresswoman uses to manipulate Andrie. God,I wanted soemone to stick it to her. What a wonderful villain! Everyone should keep their mind open and read this book."
5,Wonderfully Crafted!,"What can I say - I loved this book! I read it practically overnight...I couldn't put it down! Juliet Carrera has crafted a wonderfully written story, with people in it that you're going to love and some you're going to hate - you know, regular folks. This is a story about true passion and what one person will do to protect the one she loves. I really don't want to give away too much of this story but I will say that I read the last few pages with dizzying speed and, by the time I was done, there were tears of happiness in my eyes. Yes, there is a happy ending and that's all I'm going to tell you, except to say read this book! You'll be glad you did!"
5,One of the best romance book ever,"From the moment you enter this book, Juliet captures your mind and emotions. She is able to project you into this love affair as a bystander wanting to jump out and help rescue Destiny. It is very easy to get involved and NOT be able to put the book down. For anyone was has a love relationship like this or who would like to live vicariously through this one,this book is the one for you. It is extremely uplifting, positive and most of all real. A great gift to give to anyone you know and love."
5,"Must read, indeed!","I don't care who/what you are, this book is an absolute MUST READ! From page 1 all the way through to page 396, you will find yourself unable to put it down; sometimes unable to breathe; sometimes unable to stop crying, screaming, yelling...Breathtaking, invigorating, hopeful...you name it, Juliet Carrera has created it in Inside Out...I can't wait for the sequel!"
4,Wicked,"The villian of the story, Andrie's lover, is a great villian. Very wicked. I liked the story and the content but was disappointed at the lack of love scenes. Not enough steam, and not very fulfilling. The book could have been longer also. All in all, it's a great sory. I would recommend it."
2,inside out,"Reading this book was time consuming . I believe that the story was interesting but the flow was missing. The potential of this being a ""must read"" book was lost after the first chapter. Ms. Carrera added too many details needed at the last minute. It lacked the continuum of a good story."
3,Great showcase for Robert Culp,"Enjoyable comedy about repo guys getting involved in a kidnapping has a few typical indie-faults; a couple of scenes don't wholly work (especially regarding the initial introduction of and kidnapping of the ballplayer) due likely to a lack of coverage and funds. Some scenes also are better scripted than others. Why the film generally works anyway is a spirited cast, and a loose, generous style that allows for easy forgiveness from the audience. I came at this as a Robert Culp fan, and Culp fans will not be disappointed; he doesn't just have a glorified cameo -- he is indeed the 2nd lead, there from beginning to end, at at age 75 or so looks like he's having a lot of fun in his meatiest role in some time. He's the best thing in the picture, but he's excellent, so that's not really slighting this uneven but quite likeable film."
5,Worth the wait! Hilarious!,"This is a charming romp about lovable losers. After several views, it gets even funnier! Great performances from a wonderful, diverse cast of characters.I had heard about this movie about two years before I received it on DVD. Robert Culp is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint. He's the master of stage business and posseses about a million facial expressions, which he always uses to maximize a character.Shawnee Smith lends her unique style to a wonderful mix.Don't miss the short films by Eric Flemming and Andrea Michaud that are included on the DVD; their humor is worth of Abrahams/Zucker/Abrahams.Long live the Independent film-makers! Esp. when they produce such wonderful entertainment."
5,An amazing novel. A truely great story.,"I am not usually into the romance novels but this one was truely exceptional. I was amazed with the quality, the plot, and the storyboard itself, while also admiring the detailing of the story. I would recommend this book to all lesbian readers."
1,Awful!,"I absolutely despise so-called ""romance novels"" that are filled with rape and degrading sex scenes. And then when the ""one"" comes along, they hold hands. This was a truly horrendous book, a waste of the paper it was printed on. It's only good for fire starter."
1,A justifieable review... of all we know about this book,"Two hundred forty dollars.I'd really love to read this book, to gain knowledge from it, to learn from it, to congratulate the author for his hard work and the publisher for their backing of the project. I'd really like to be able to support the author and the publisher of this book.But the price is just too much, even used copies. And no one is reviewing it... because no one is buying it, I guess.My state's libraries don't carry it. When I asked my local why, they said the price vs. requests.Author, Publisher please. If you make a book isn't the point for it to be read ... by at least some group of people who may be able to take it and run with its ideas straight to Congress?Even getting it down to a hundred is at least in the realm of the realistic.Until there's proof to the contrary, the book must be terrible because all we have to judge it by is the terrible price."
2,Angst and despair in the midwest,"Well, Brink tried to write a story for adults, but she stretched a little far. The characters are thin and the story is hyperbolic and not believable. Yes, there were great tragic love stories in small towns, but this doesn't capture one."
2,Battle Ground Dissapointed,"I have been teaching courses on WWII & I for the past 5 years and have over 300 Documentaries in my library. The flow of events in Battle Ground is disjointed. Many of the segments s are superficial and give only facts and not the why and the narration on a number of them is given in a boring tone of voice. If I were to compare it with ""The world At War"" which I would give a 9 this would be a 1."
3,Twistables?,"I have only used the ""cookie sheet"" which is really a roasting pan, as it says on the box. These products do seem sturdy and non-stick. However, when I placed a frozen pizza on the ""cookie sheet"", I heard a pop in my oven. I looked inside and the roasting pan was warped. It was no more than 425 degrees in there maybe less, I don't recall. Then after I turned off the oven, I heard another pop, and the pan warped back into its original shape. The pizza came out fine, but I have never used it since! I'm afraid it's going to explode inside my oven. I just don't feel safe. Oh yeah, I've tried the muffin tin. It was ok. I don't think that one warped. If the cookie sheet keeps popping, I'm going to return it to get a replacement. Comes with 10 year warranty."
1,Sadly dissapointed,"I own some of the Simply Calphalon pots and pans and they have been great. So, I was hoping that the bakeware would be just as good. I received the set for Christmas and have used 2 of the pieces, the muffin pan and the baking dish. Both times the items I have cooked have stuck to the pans. The baking dish stuck so bad that after soaking it for 3 days and using a dobie pad on it, the non stick finish came off.I am sadly dissapointed in these pieces and would not recommend these to anyone."
2,Simply Calphalon - simply crap,"OK, crap may be a bit too harsh but they have tried to pass this stuff off as good buy skinping on the nonstick coating and using overly heavy metal. I have had this set now for several months and the baking sheet has not been as nonstick as you'd think. I have had to scrub it a bit with as nonabrasive a pad as I could. The nonstick coating has worn off in spots -- the same spots I always put cookies or biscuits. Assuming that I got a defective unit I have another complaint. These baking pieces have rolled edges that hold water and RUST. This is no defect but merely a poor design.Bottom line:1. Great price2. Too heavy3. Poor nonstick coating4. Edges hold water and rust.5. I'd have expected these to equal the quality of my other Calphalon cokware: Pots, pans, skillets, pot holders, towels, apron and spoons.6. I would have agreed to other reviews 100% but they are from an initial point of view from which this set looks good."
3,Heavy and No-stick coating wears out,"Sorry, I bought this set and for a guy my size they are HEAVY. The non-stick coating is starting to give out and I'm back to using baking parchment or teflon sheets on top of the cookie sheets.I think they have a short life span of heavy duty usage. I wouldn't buy them again."
4,"For the ""heavy duty"" baker","This set puts my old baking set to shame. It feels like it will last to become a family heirloom! I am very pleased with the quality and construction of the pieces. Although they are non-stick, the instructions do tell the user, if the recipe calls for it, to use a small amount of non-stick cooking spray and then wipe out the extra. I did a test and sprayed the loaf pan but not the muffin tins while doing banana bread/muffins. The loaf popped right out but the muffins stuck enough that I needed to use a rubber spatula to keep from leaving the bottoms in the pan. (Following manufacturer's directions, it would not have been a problem.) My recipe also called for spraying AND flouring the pan which was unnecessary with the Calphalon pieces. Since the pieces are very heavy and slick when wet, I don't think they are appropriate for a baker with weak wrists or unsure hands."
1,Not really non-stick,"I bought these about 1 and 1/2 years ago and have not had good success. I am sorely dissappointed.I have trouble with everything sticking to this stuff, I would not recommend buying this stuff. Even cookies stick!"
2,Just Okay Pans,"These pans are certainly not living up to the Calphalon name, everything sticks to them, and they are very difficult to get clean. Granted, they are not very expensive, but I would have paid more gladly to have better non-stick.Some reviewers say you need to hand wash them, but the item description clearly states ""Dishwasher-safe; 10-year warranty"" Overall I would not buy them again."
4,Great value,"The pans are very sturdy and for not much more money than some cruddy pans bought at the discount store. The only warning I have is that when you wash the pans, either by hand or in the dishwasher, make sure you dry them immediately. Water can easily get into and collect in the rolled edges of the pans and the rusty liquid is no pleasant surprise. Otherwise, a great value and very good quality."
2,Non-stick coating comes off quickly,"I received this set as a gift and was initially pleased and impressed. After using the cookie sheet 3 times, the nonstick coating is eroding in spots. I had expected better from Calphalon."
1,"Don't waste your money on the ""Simply"" line","Having many other calphalon pieces and absolutlely loving them, I eagerly bought this because of the excellent price. What a complete waste. The coating in these pans comes off too easily, even when using plastic coated utensils and washing with care. Of course with each subsequent usage things would just stick even more. I tried to clean them (with just a sponge and gentle detergent as recommended) and those areas would lose even more of their non-stick surface. So in the end I just bought all of the same pans in the ""Not Simply"" line. Ahhh, what a relief. I do love the Calphalon quality, which is the only reason this got any stars at all."
3,Please remaster the Easybeats,"Further to Charles Phelps' excellent review, I just wish to echo his sentiments in asking that the Easybeats be remastered from the original tapes. They are arguably one of the greatest Australian bands to come out of the sixties, and deserve better. My personal preference was for the albums before England. Surely record companies, who have made so much money off the Easybeats, can make this remastering thing happen."
3,Business Coach,"I found this book very informative, and down to earth. Often books of this type are dry and didactic. I like the way the writer blends her own experiences and those of her clients into the writiing.This book is more like reading a letter from a good friend than a ""How-to"" text.I'm a business coach myself. I learned a lot about how to coach and about myself as well!"
4,Coaching into Greatness,"I have not finished this book as yet, however to this point I find it enlightening and offers a fresh new way to look at the benefits of Coaching. It combines all elements of what I believe Coaching should be to people."
3,Just out to discredit the work of other authors,"The pretentious author of this book begins by debunking the myth of the Templar treasure of Gizors and then proceeds to discredit the theories of almost all Templar authors. We are left believing that he must know the truth, although he does not present us with any credible theories of his own!"
5,Interesting and Informative,"""Managing Your Headaches"" is so readable, it's hard to believe the authors have explained more about headaches than a medical text."
5,A Frisky Hero,"Kasperle is a character full of mischief, good intentions, and energy. What he's not is ordinary. He gets into trouble often with hilarious results. Think of Tyler McNiven's (Amazing Race) spirited journey around the world and you've found a good likeness.I wonder why it's not been made into a film."
2,"Junky, throwaway camera...","Enough said. Don't expect much, this is just a basic, cheap 35mm. Point and shoot, hope for the best. Might be good for adventures where you want some pictures without risking your expensive cameras. Looks and feels cheaply made, but I've seen worse for the price."
2,"Not quite unmitigated, but a disaster nonetheless.","Painfully overwritten, with passages of eye-roll-worthy bombast that make one shudder at the thought of ever having to hold a conversation with Brown. The assiduous research the author clearly carried out is, alas, rather poorly edited, and then rendered into passages of the most torturous purple prose.Flaubert is indeed a fascinating figure; and Brown does not *totally* fail in communicating this. However, for all the technical acumen this biographer is blessed with, he is woefully lacking in grace. Don't come looking for the deft brevity of a skilled historian, but rather for a farrago of murky narrative and hack psychoanalysis reflecting the masturbatory garrulity of a writer blindly infatuated with their own talent.If you buy it, buy it used. I think someone's selling it for $0.88."
2,"Flaubert, a difficult read","Dense text resulted in my frequent loss of concentration (I got lost). When Flabert is addressed, there are too many assumptions and presumptions. Guessing I can do without. There are passages of literary excellency, but one must weed through too much tedium to find treasures. This is more of a history lesson than a biographical description and analysis."
3,Wig restorer,"It works okay to bring the rat nest wigs back to life... It's not as good as I expected it to be though, it makes them sort of greasy and heavy."
1,This is like a bottle of grease or the old tube of hair VO,"This is simply a bottle of gucky thick viscous liquid that went on looking like I had oiled my hair. Even had to wash my wig twice to get this stuff out. I would not recommend this product. The Brandywine Shampoo, Conditioner and Wig Detangler are all great products. This wasn't worth my having to pay shipping to return so it went right into the trash."
2,Doesn't work on a thicker laminate countertop,"It matched the faucet well, was made well, but not enough threads to fit my thicker counter top. I also did not like the white piece under the cover showing on top of the countertop."
1,super sad,"This rustic bronze (dark colored) dishwasher vent cover came with a WHITE washer it sits on. I have a dark countertop, so the white strip is unbearable and impossible to find in black."
4,We love it cause its natural,"We love that this product is totally natural. If you like the smell of a creamsicle then you will definitely like the smell of this lotion, because thats what it smells like. It is a little runny, but leave the kids nice and soft."
1,Irritated my skin,"I wish I would have read the reviews more carefully. I bought two bottles of this lotion and found the formula irritating on my skin. It smells great and I love that they use natural products, but something in there leaves my skin red and irritated. My guess is that the orange essence is too strong.I'm hoping to give my two bottles away to someone who can tolerate it. I'm sure most can, but if you have sensitive skin, I would be careful ordering this product without first sampling it."
3,"Just Ok, the scent is strong","I bought this lotion for my one year old son after reading the positive reviews. Prior to that we were using CA Baby Organics. The lotion worked fine, but the scent was a bit overwhelming, and left no trace of the natural baby skin scent, which I loved. After each bath, all I would smell was the lotion for hours on my son's skin. We still have 80% of the bottle left so a little of this lotion goes a long way."
3,Gives My Baby A Rash,"Although I really like this product, it gave my baby a rash. Luckily, I can use the remainder of the bottle on me!"
1,No Way,I had this item in my cart to purchase. And thank GOD I just so happen made a trip to my local natural grocery/shopping center.. Nature Patch. They had this item there and I was able to smell and test it before hand. And let me say this crap stinks!!!! It was awful I dont know who in their right mind would want their baby to smell anything like this lotion. I hated that I even put it on my hand let alone all over my baby. Just an FYI!!! I was saved so hopefully this review can save someone else. This lotion is too expensive for it not to at least deliver when it comes to the scent.
1,Worst natural product ever!,"I bought this baby lotion after checking the hazard rating at ewg.org. Was excited to find this natural product and ordered it (previously used adorable baby body lotion which is no longer available anywhere).Used only for 2 days for my 2 yr old boy and he had sever rash all over the body, stopped applying this body lotion on him and the entire rash is gone. Never expected such result from a natural product. Lesson learnt, next time when I try any new (even though it is natural) product on him I will try to apply a small patch on his hand rather than blindly trusting the product and making him suffer.As always amazon customer service was awesome when contacted them about this issue they issued a full refund."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought this based on reviews that I read for my son's sensitive skin. I've tried all the known brands like Johnson's, Aveeno, etc... and discovered that he has eczema. With no improvements with the typical sensitive skin products, I tried an organic brand called ""Love Me, Baby Me"" and it did wonders for his skin. Pretty much a 95% improvement. I figured that it must be the ""organic"" that helped and wanted to try other ""organic"" brands that weren't as expensive, so I purchased this lotion and it was very watery. The lotion is highly fragrant and caused rashy bumps on his arms. I also tried ""California Baby"" and the same thing, it's really thin and not as effective. I guess I will have to stick with the ""Love Me, Baby Me"" even though it's more pricey. Hope this is helpful for those of you in search of the right lotion and baby wash for your baby's sensitive skin."
4,Smells great,"I love Earth Mama products - especially the Angel Baby Bottom Balm! So when I was looking for a safer lotion for my son's skin I tried this first. We really like it. It's smooth, not greasy. Goes on easily and absorbs easily. I love the mild citrus scent. We've not had any rashes/reactions."
4,Great stuff,Not too thick! Just right! We were looking for good quality lotion but not CVS junk... This cream works well for dry skin areas!
4,Excellent organic baby lotion!,"I tried this lotion after reading numerous labels- this may just very well be the only baby lotion with no preservatives or artificial fragrances- even the Burt's Bees for sensitive skin has ""fragrance"" as an ingredient. This smells really nice and light, absorbs and moisturizes well, and isn't oily. It's dry out here in California and we do have to moisturize multiple times between bathing, but that's par for the course. We all use it and no one has any reactions. If they used glass or BPA-free containers and skipped the e-wax, I would have given them 5 stars."
5,Wonderful product,"Smells great (it is like a Creamsicle, like someone else said, but somehow it works) and it feels FABULOUS -- super soft, easily absorbed, very gentle. A splurge, yes, but we love it."
2,Hate the orange scent,"I got this lotion because I had used the Earth Mama stretch oil, which had a great smell and prevented stretch marks during my pregnancy. I was disappointed at this lotion. Although it worked fine as a lotion and hasn't irritated my newborn's skin, the orange smell is just overwhelming. It doesn't smell like the stretch oil at all. The smell is very strong and makes me feel nauseated."
2,Smell is overwhelming,"The lotion itself is OK, but the smell is very overwhelming. If you don't want your child to smell like an orange, don't buy this."
2,Not so much,"I heard nothing but good things about this lotion. Since using my daughter has developed a rash(though I can't really know if this lotion caused it) and it doesn't moisturize very well. Also, it smells very strongly of ALCOHOL, probably because there is a lot of alcohol in it. I prefer Mild By Nature Every Day Lotion by Madre Labs by a long shot."
4,Printer Dock Bag,The bag is fine. It does the job. However it could be a little bigger. Quality piece.
2,Not the Best,"This bag is easy to carry and well padded, but...... The printer fits in the bag nicely,but leaves precious little room for the camera, power supply, manuals and other accessories without jamming them in.Dave"
5,Kodak Travel Bag for Printer Dock,"Rencently went on a driving trip to Canada, the carrying case was excellent for my camera, printer dock, power cord & misc. items."
4,Nice Product,A very nice product when you are traveling with your camera & dock. I have a smaller case just for the day trips.
5,own two of these bags,"this bad is a pretty good size. holds my printer dock, camera and photo mp3 player which is bigger than my camera. i love it"
3,Kodak Travel Bag,"Detachable section doesn,t make sense. Compartment not large enough for camera. Bag is overpriced."
5,Saving lives with the Royalty Pill Dispenser,"I am an R.N. and also a Diabetic. I have used this dispenser every day, twice a day. I use one for my morning pills and one for my evening pills. This way I can set them up for a month. There are times when I have forgotten to take my pills or really couldn't remember but with the Royalty pill organizer all I had to do was look and see what day the last pills were taken. They have been very helpful in managing my Diabetes, helping me to take medications on a regular schedule every day. I highly recommend this item to be used, especially for the elderly who often need assistance in organizing and correctly taking their medications.Cecelia R. Peterson,R.N."
5,madside,All around awesome recording!! Tight musicians & even tighter production of the cd! This cd ROCKS!!
4,It's really a thriller.,"How did L. A. Franco ever get her job? She hates her boss and distrusts the whole LA Police Department that she works for in Baxter Clare's good, new book ""Bleeding Out"". She's tough and competent. I got the book for a birthday present, and I wasn't sure I'd finish it. The back cover blurb says ""Mystery/Lesbian Fiction"", and that isn't anything I'd pick up for myself. But after a few pages, just a sample, I couldn't leave the book alone. Baxter Clare's first novel is a hell of a story. It's very graphic, but that goes with the territory, Southeast Los Angeles. Frank, that's what everybody calls Franco, drags you along with her single-minded determination to get the villain. She's real and her friends and coworkers are real. And the bad guy is really BAD. ""Bleeding Out"" is what a thriller should be. It will have broad appeal among all us mystery fans."
2,Didn't know it was a lesbian based book...,I wouldn't have given it too many stars anyway. It was boring to me..too much police interaction and the subject was a little too weird but I somehow missed that it was also about lesbianism. I thought Baxter Clare was a man! That a lesbian wrote it doesn't matter to me..just the lesbian parts didn't interest me.
5,Great Gift,Product arrived earlier than expected and are prettier than the picture. Will be a terrific Christmas gift. Will order again
4,Moms awesome birthday,"I bought this item as a part of a 3pc set for my mothers birthday......While she loved the earrings, I myself was a little disappointed with the look to the earrings on two fronts. First off the earrings look stiff, I expected them to dangle a bit but they're straight and stiffer then a stiff on in the morn -_-. and secondly, the color of the chips were really light compared to the other 2 pieces.But all in all my mother didn't mind, and she was quite moved by the gift."
5,Very pretty earrings,These earrings are very nicely made. I bought them for my 12 year old niece for Christmas. They look very cute on her!
5,delightful,"I am absolutely delighted by the Amethyst earings, they go very well with my amethyst necklace that cost considerably more when costed by # of stones."
4,Excellent for the price!,"I bought a pair of these earrings for myself about 5 months ago. They are still in excellent condition, despite multiple wearings, and I am very pleased with them; the silver is still bright and untarnished. I bought three more pairs to give to relatives this Christmas, and they are also delighted with the earrings.The reason I did not give five stars is that the earrings do not look like the picture. Like another reviewer commented, the earrings I received are all the darkest purple; there is not the lovely gradation of tones shown in the photo. Furthermore, the earrings I received do not have the variation in stone shape shown in the photo. It may be that each pair is different, and I just received several similar pairs by coincidence.However, like I said, I am pleased with the product nonetheless, and the price is unbeatable! I would buy more of these."
3,Looks great in the picture,In reality it looks just like a bunch of cheep stones strung together quickly. Have doubts that it will hold up over time.
3,It's Okay.,"I ordered it and I'll wear them sometime, but I'm not in love with them. It's rough looking and cheapish."
2,Color not Consistent,"I know it's the nature of natural stones not to have consistent color, but I didn't like the way these earrings went from light at the top to dark at the bottom. If the bracelet can be made with matching stones, I would think they could make the earrings the same way."
1,Not up to scratch,"This was an obvioius hurried product which is not up to the level of other instructional materials available for the didgeridoo. While the spoken instructions are clear enough, the playing examples are quite weak. A seven minute introduction not only delays the beginning of instruction, but is basically a very poor display of play skills which make the user wonder why the performer is teaching anyone. While advertised as 'beginner through intermediate' the average person will surpass the playing skills of the instructor in no time flat and hunger to learn something, anything from anyone else.With all the learning materials now available for this instrument, I would recommend searching a bit more, perhaps paying a bit more and getting a far better start to your playing experience.Peter"
1,Seriously lacking,"I think the most important concept in learning to play a rhythm instrument is the rhythm. Something totally lacking in all playing examples on this disc. The demonstrations of playing are all very wandering, forgetable series of 'noises' that demonstrate a complete lack of understanding by the instructor of the difference between music and 'noise'. This CD leads the student nowhere and unceremoniously leaves them there, out ten bucks and searching for a real musician to teach them. The didgeridoo is a remarkable instrument in the right hands. This so called 'how to' CD makes a joke of it."
1,This is on the Box Set,"Having just bought this pilot episode, I now realise that it is included on the season 1 box set. The box set also has an actors commentary on it.I feel ripped of.Yuk."
4,Back in time.,I purchased this for my husband who used to watch this show while growing up. It's like he's back in time and enjoys the show.
4,Ye ha!,"The first episode 'One Armed Bandits' is a fun watch and shows the portions that are used in the opening credits which some viewers may never have seen before. Also the big jump is in this episode, it pretty much broke the car in half.Burt Reynolds is mentioned because the idea of the Dukes came fromSmokey and the Bandit. Additionally there are previews and interviews aboutDukes of Hazzard (Rated)and the guy to play Roscoe says that in Mexico the show is called 'Numero Uno' for the General Lee. I thought that was interesting."
3,Funny,"The pilot is interesting and gives you a very nice introduction to the show, I highly recomend the show."
1,Bent pole,So disappointed. The lower part of the pole was bent so it was impossible to make the umbrella look straight. It does look funny.
5,simple and classic umbrella,Since I have one set of wood furniture setin my backyard and it match good withteak finish. It is easy to open and close.
5,My most used pan!,I have owned this for 10 yrs (didnt buy from Amazon) and I use it for everything. Strongly recommend buying this.
3,Used to be my favorite pan until recently,"I have been using this pan happily for almost 2 years. Simple sautes, egg dishes, etc. I can't comment on oven use, as I've only used it on the stove top. Recently I tried searing fish; medium heat, small amount of olive oil to the pan. The fish turned out perfectly. The clean up following was unbelievably difficult and is still underway. Barkeeper's Friend with scotch brite (as recommended by calphalon) was the most effective in removing some of the stuck on food/debris, but I wasn't able to get all of it off. I'm requesting a replacement as this pan is under lifetime warranty. We'll see what happens."
3,"A good everyday pan, with some quirks....","First let me say at the price, this pan is a bargain. No two ways to slice it, for less than $30, this pan has a whole lot of utility. Now on to the down-sides:1) The handles are ridiculously small and conduct heat quickly, meaning if you cook with it for five minutes, you're going to be using pot-holders. It seems weird calphalon (who ordinarily examines every detail) would let this one slip. These handles are small, uncomfortable, and strange shaped. Its almost as if the manufacturer in China did not have the correct ones and crafted these as a stop-gap. Hard to say, I don't like the handles.2) When I fry in this pan, oil seems to stick unusually easily to it, only way I could get it off was sandpaper (which did not seem to hurt the finish).Everything else about the pan is GREAT! It's definitely worth buying for the price. My favorite feature to this is the lid, its a well-made, light but thick, well-made domed lid."
5,Awesome pan when used for intended purpose,"I just ordered another one of these pans today. I purchased one a year ago and it is my favorite and most used pan. It works great for browning hamburger, then adding taco seasoning or spaghetti sauce and letting simmer. It is not nonstick, nor does the manufacturer claim it is. I have read many reviews slamming this pan because foods like eggs stick (I have a calphalon contemporary nonstick that works great for eggs). I find that it is relatively easy to clean if I let it soak for a few minutes before washing. The pan does show markings of coloration or scratches, but they in no way affect the performance of the pan."
3,Good value,"I ordered this pan and love the size and lid, great value for a calphalon pan. Just know that most food will probably sick to the bottom of the pan, i'm still unsure whether i could ever get half of the food that stuck of the bottom of pan out - ever."
4,good cookware,"like the cookware, cleaning is somewhat of a hassle. i was surprised to see that a company, who for generations prided themselves as being US made, has now started manufacturing the cookware in China. same quality, but something to consider."
3,Great Value,The price was very good for this product. I was disappointed how quickly the anodized coating scratched through to aluminum. Still cooks well and cleans up well.
5,"Everyday, Everyway Pan","Name it and you can do it with this everyday pan - one of Calphalon's best!!!No fluff, no bells and whistles just an outstanding plain-vanilla commercial grade hard-anodized metal pan and lid that performs beautifully and cleans up with ease.This was only my second adventure into Calphalon and it will not be my last."
1,Non stick - NOT!!,"I guess when they say ""stick and scratch resistant"" they mean that the pan resists being scratched by a stick! Everything sticks to it so they must mean the other kind of stick from a tree!!"
3,Best pan for the money,"I have owned thiis pan for 6 months now, so far I have cooking pancakes, and lots of french toast, along with hash browns etc. It works as well as any non stick pan I ever used, and I have used many being a retired chef Who formely worked at a high end B&B. I have read all the negative reviews and I call BS this is a great pan."
1,Hard to use,"I found out the hard way what ""Hard-Anodized"" means: Everything sticks to this surface. Impossible to use without making a mess. Big mistake."
5,Makes cooking easy,"I recently purchased this for my skeptical wife, and I was the first to use it. I used it to fry some breaded seafood, and it was a mess. I was sure that I would need to scrub the caked on flour, but I was wrong. I wet the pan, used a little soap, and everything just peeled away. A soft sponge with a little soap is all I've needed to clean this pan. And cooking in it is easy. It heats evenly, and the lid fits nice and tight."
1,faulty (imitation? )product,"I ordered one Calaphon 12 in everyday pan-- then got a replacement both were difective They had pin holes, dings and small scraches on the cooking surface. On the replacement pan I noticed they were made in China not Ohio. Both pans did not come in Calaphon boxes.A second replacement seemed pointless.It would have been an usefull pan if the expected Calaphon quality was there"
2,Go with Cuisinart,"Bought it for my wife who is the chef in the family. I thought it was a non-stick pan for around $35, but found out that it is not non-stick. She uses the non-stick Cuisinart pan and loves it. She has to add oil with this pan, so not nearly as happy with it.Just be aware that this is NOT a non-stick pan before you buy."
2,Non Stick?,I do not like this item. I will keep it as an extra and because I got a good Amazon price. Food stick and hard to clean. Not a winner. So disappointed in this product.
3,"Calphalon is the best, but this is NOT non stick","I'd like to start by saying I love the Calphalon brand and the non stick line with the clear lids are the best. Even though this pan is a great size, beware this is NOT a NON STICK pan. In fact, half of the meal cooked in it will stick. As long as you soak the pan right after use, it's still not to bad to clean and I do use the rough side of the sponge without damage to the pan."
1,A little disappointed,"After first use, it stained already. After the second use, I put it away. I would only use it when I am going to cook with liquid. I would not use it to make steak, pork chop, etc. (It was the original reason I got this pan.) I have several products of this brand, but this is the only one that I am speechless."
3,Calphalon 12-inch Everyday Pan,"OK for the price(around $30.00). But as a long time owner of the old commercial pans made in Toledo OH, these just don't compare in weight or quality. I've had my old pans for 20+ years and still use them daily. Commercial means that they are Industrial Grade cookware. These are NOT, they are home use grade pans. As a Chef I know the difference, I work with commercial grade cookware daily. These pans are made in China. They are Not shoddy just not what the company used to sell as commercial."
2,Not impressed,I needed this size pan and thought I would give it a try since it was a great price. I have never tried Calphalon. It is no where near the high quality as my Anolon pans. The food sticks leaving the inside discolored and it does not wash well. I wash all my pans by hand. I was not impressed at all and actually very disappointed because I thought the Calphalon name carried some weight. I consider myself a good cook and use my pans alot. I don't think I will buy this name brand again.
1,Disappointing,Did not perform as expected. Food kept sticking to the base of the pan. Inconvenient size. The lid does not invert into the pan for easy storage in a shelf. So nothing can be pilled upon it for storage in shelves. Returned this product.
5,HOW can foods stick??,"I have used this line for 5 years and have never had a meal sick (even when I let it burn) less than a teaspoon of water and the food (even the burned) releases immediately and you can continue to cook.. read your Manual and then use the pans, do not discard them.. you will never replace them.. but You might add to them.. :D I now have 2 sets and all the extra pans two :D"
1,The Every Thing Sticks Pan,"I have a couple other calphalon pans, I LOVE them. That's why I ordered this one. I can't cook anything in this one without it sticking. It's way worse than a stainless steel pan without a non stick surface. I don't use it at all any more. It's not even good enough to go into my camping cook box. Don't but it."
2,Disappointed,"I bought five of these for Christmas presents. I was very disappointed when they arrived. They are no where NEAR the same quality as the Calphalon pots and pans I have previously purchased elsewhere. They aren't horrible, but closer to the value of the $28 price tag than the higher suggested retail value."
4,This is an exelent product.,It came with some minor nicks and dings but over all it's great.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the handles get really hot when you're using it. It heats really evenly and cleans relatively easily.
5,Calphalon - the best!,"I can't say enough about this specific line of Calphalon...cooking and cleaning made easy! This is my third piece and my most favorite...I use it quite often during the week, most often to stir fry fresh veggies for a quick pasta sauce - and I serve my meal in this pan."
5,Impressed,"Having a new parrot we had to stop using teflon, I heard good things about this cookware. Got it and LOVE it. If you follow the instructions it's better than teflon!! Just also purchased the set I liked it so well."
1,Love turns warped!!,Great at first. Used it strictly according to directions -- always hand washed (even the lid) NEVER in the dishwasher. Within 3 mos. noticed things (like eggs) creeping to the center of the pan. Then I got my new ceramic topped stove -- the thing literally spins like a top. Of course this means only a fraction of the pan is in contact with the heat source. It's only appropriate for oven use or on a campfire now. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!
2,"Calphalon 12"" Everyday Pan","The pan is very versatile, however, when coking, food tends to stick to the pan more than I had anticipated. The cleanup process usually needs to soak the pan and use a non-abrasive pad."
5,"Durable, way better than non-stick","After going through many non-stick pans (I had to throw them out because the coating started to peel off), I was searching for another material other than non-stick. This hard-anodized pan does a beautiful job. The trick is you have to heat up the pan before you add your cooking oil, and when the oil starts to smoke a little you add your food to the pan. With that simple ""trick"", my food rarely sticks to the pan. And cleaning up is easy - you can scrub it with anything, including steel wool without hurting the cooking surface."
5,I love this pan!,"I truly do use this pan everyday. It can be used for everything from soup to stir fry. It is large enough to cook for a croud; I just wish they would make the same pan in a smaller size for when there are just the two of us. As with all Calphalon you have to keep it very clean and heat it before putting meat in it, but those are small trade offs for the even heating and quality of these pans."
1,Everything sticks!,"I want to preface this review by saying that I own several pieces of Calphalon cookware. Usually, performance is not an issue. It is with this pan. I echo the complaints of other reviewers. EVERYTHING sticks, from stirfry dishes to French toast. Experimentation with regulating temperature made no difference.However, Calphalon products do come with a lifetime warranty. Calphalon was more very helpful when contacted, and the company is in the process of sending a replacement.You can contact the company at 1-800-809-7267. The mailing address for warranty returns is Calphalon Consumer Relations, 315 Matzinger Road, Building C, Toledo, OH 43612."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first Calphalon pan I have purchased. After hearing how wonderful Calphalon was, I couldn't believe how poorly it preformed. It seems no matter what I prepare in this pan, it sticks and is diffcult to clean. I now rarely use it and know if it was easier to clean I would use it often. Very disappointed."
1,Worst. Pan. Ever.,"I just used this pan for the first time and am so disappointed. I attempted to make chicken hash (recipe courtesy of Ina Garten) and after using both butter and oil, my potatoes and onions melded to the pan. They left a layer of crust that could not be moved, I absolutely dread cleaning the pan!I don't recommend this in the least."
4,Great everyday pan,"My only complaint about this pan is the finish. It didn't look great even before I used it. But I didn't buy it to put it on display. It's a great pan to cook in and since the finish wasn't great to begin with, I don't feel guilty about putting it in the dishwasher. Hmmm ... that might even be a plus!"
2,Not what I'd expected. . . .,"Having purchased several pieces in the Calphalon line and being quite pleased with everything from the basic Simply Calphalon to the Commercial Non-stick line, this item left me disappointed. Not only was I saddened to learn that this ""commercial"" grade pan was not manufactured in Toledo as are other pieces of my collection, but the quality was less than that of the Simply line. Rough edges predominate the handles on both the pan and cover, the weight was less than other pans of the same size, and shipping or storage had left the pan with a dent to both it and the cover. Although it still manages to function as a brazier, it does not measure up to the quality one comes to expect from the Calphalon name."
3,love this pan,"I really love this pan; however, I will never try to cook eggs in it again. It was very hard to clean after scrambling eggs.The pan has developed a brown discolored spot on the inside that will not go away. Other than those two problems, the pan is an excellent value."
4,Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid,I was expecting a larger pan but the pan still looks like a real good value. I have not used it yet.
2,Sticky Non-stick,"This is supposed to be a non-stick surface but the first time we cooked French toast it was toast. Even with spray-on cooking oil, the French toast was inedible. So much of it stuck to the surface, we had to throw it out. It stands to reason if someone is selling a product at ""82%"" discount, there must be something wrong with it."
1,Too sticky,"I wish I read the reviews here before I bought this pan. Everything sticks. I tried frying fish on Christmas eve in it. What a disaster. I had to use my 10"" non-stick omelete pan. Took me forever. This pan is also very difficult to clean."
2,This is *not* a nonstick pan,"Please don't get fooled into thinking (like me) that this ia a non-stick pan. If your looking for non-stick, this is NOT what you want. Everything sticks to it like crazy.I'm giving it 2 stars 'cos I have only tried sautéing vegetables. This pan might still be good for making sauces and other stuff. But this isn't an ""EVERYTHING"" pan like they have claimed.I bought one recently (Dec 2003) and returned it since I was unable to make simple stuff like hashbrowns, etc. With a good 3 tablespoon of oil, it still sat there stuck to the bottom! Save yourself the hassle of having to return it and the money you will be spending to return this stuff back. No wonder it has such a big price cut!"
1,Calphalon 12 inch Everyday Pan with Cover,"Item is attractive but it is made in China. Experience wuth products such as these, made in China proved to be unsatisfactory. Generally, foods tend to stick making cleaning very difficult. Because of the sticking problem, foods burn unless watched very carefully."
2,cheap quality,I thought I was getting a good quality product with Calphalon but what a disappointment. It is a poor design made with poor materials. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Almost Good Enough,"The form and size of this pan are good features, but it does not work well with sticking. Other reviews suggested that as long as you follow directions, it works well as far as food sticking to the pan. WRONG. I am very disappointed in this aspect and wish I had gone with a non-stick pan."
5,"Fast, Good Condition!","Thanks, your delivery was timely, despite the Christmas rush. The pans arrived in excellent condition!"
4,Frying Pan,Good Price & Good Product. I have been wanting to test a Calphalon Pan for a while and will likely purchase more.
1,everything sticks in it even bacon,I purchased two and wish I didn't even have one as the bacon even sticks to this product.
3,nonstick would make it great,"This is my first hard-anodized pan, and I won't buy another. The weight and size of the pan are great, and I love the handles on both sides for safe transport to the table, but with hind sight, I should have bought the non-stick 10-inch if it had been available. This size is good for casseroles for my young family of 4 kids."
1,STICKS,I Will Stick With Anolon. Thought This Pan Would Not Stick Real Hard To Clean Will Not Order Any More Calphalon.James
3,product satisfaction,"I have not bought or used this pan, but am responding to Vietnamese cook who is unhappy with this purchase. I bought a Calphalon 8 qt pot from Amazon a few years ago, and it just wasn't right. It discolored on the bottom and was not like an older and smaller Calphalon I loved to cook with. I emailed Amazon saying it didn't cook to my satisfaction, and they immediately responded and said they were sending me a new one, and to send the other back...shipping on them. The newer pan is much better. I guess I could have asked for my money back, but I really wanted to give the pot another try. So don't give up, and you don't have to keep the two pans. Good luck."
1,Calphalon 12-inch w/cover,I have other calphalon that I love but for some reason this everything sticks in this pan. I did notice that this pan says Made In China on the bottom while the ones that I like do not. Could this be the problem?? When I contacted Amazon that I was having problems with this pan they were nice enough to send me a new one but it is the same exact pan - also made in China.
1,I don't like this pan,"I have tried lots of different ways of cooking with this pan, and everything sticks to it. I bought it to replace a circulon pan, that was getting old, and I still use the circulon. I thought maybe I was using too high heat, that I wasn't putting enough spray or oil in the pan, nothing works, everything sticks. It's a big mess, and I wish I'd never bought it."
5,One of my best purchases!,This is the first real Calphalon that I have purchased. I have a few knockoffs that I use regularly. The size of this pan is great for many things. It is also nice to have a lid. I wish I would have purchased more at the awesome price so I could give them as gifts.
3,A mixed bag,"Good pan for the price, but hard-anodized surface is very thin and scratches off easily -- already have a couple of scraches on mine after a month. That's not typical of a quality hard-anodized pan. Great for sauces and getting a nice sear on meats -- but read other reviews on how to use this cookware. Everyday? I doubt it will last six months."
4,They're baccckkkk!,"We bought one of these a year or two ago when they were available and it's been doing almost constant duty on our stove ever since. Fry pan, wok, stew pot, dutch oven this one can do it all. Like other Calphalon Hard Anodized you'll find that things work better with lower heat than other pans require and, while not non-stick, clean up isn't that difficult.The only problem we had with this pan was that when we decided they were must have items for our kids and that we could use a second one they were gone. Poof. No longer available. They weren't kidding. Now after a year of looking all over for some Amazon[.com] has them back in stock again. We bought three... I hope that's enough. But I'm not sure....By the way this only gets four stars because the new ones, unlike my older one, are made in China."
2,Calphalon Hard-Anodized 12-inch Everyday Pan,"The pan we received does not have ""Commercial Hard-Anodized"" printed on the back as all the other Commercial Calphalon pans that we own and it was made in China. Our other Calphalon pans and skillets are made in the U.S.A. This is not the same quality that we expect in a Calphalon product."
2,impossible to clean,"I bought this pan as a trial -- thinking that if I liked it I would buy a set of Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware. I won't be buying more. I've only used it three times, and as far its preformance is concerned it seems fine -- the heat distribution is good, and the food came out well. However, after only three uses, it has developed an ugly hazy stain that is impossible to remove. I've followed all the cleaning instructions that came with the pan, but to no avail. The ""hard-anodized"" aluminum doesn't seem so hard after all."
5,Great if you Know How to Use It,"I bought this, and it has been the ideal size for our family of three big eaters. It browns meat beautifully. When you brown meat, get the oil hot, put in the meat, and then leave it alone. It sticks slightly to the pan, but when it browns, it pulls back away from the pan, and no longer sticks! Don't wash it in the dishwasher (I use a scrubber of terry covered with nylon net), with hot water and dish detergent, and it cleans up beautifully. Don't leave to air dry, but dry and put away, as you would any cookware you cherish. You can go from stovetop to oven to stovetop, when making something like Julia Child's Boeuf Bourguignon, without a hitch. I hesitated to buy this, as it seemed like a lot of money. It's been worth every penny. You'll use it all the time. Buy Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking to go with it, and you'll have one happy family."
3,Good pan but don't pay top dollar for it.,"Pluses: It is a good buy at the $29 sale price and useful as a roasting pan that can be put on the stove to reduce drippings for pan sauce. Might also do in a pinch as a paella pan, though I haven't tried this. Also good for wilting spinach and chard due to the domed lid.Minuses: Lid is very light and won't provide the deep all-around heating a similarly-shaped cast iron buffet casserole from Le Creuset would. Better to think of this piece as a roasting pan with a lid or a skillet without the long handle than a brazier."
5,Truly an Everyday Pan,"I have been using this pan virtually every rainy day since I received it(I grill on sunny days), and have found it to be a wonderful addition to my kitchen. The pan heats evenly and holds its temperature, and the lid is a great fit. The handles are sturdy and a good size and shape, particularly for a big guy like me. The pan cleans up quickly and easily. I whole heartedly recommend the product to any cook."
5,Get Product,I buy the commerical hard anodized pots. I have a large family and use them everyday. The food cooks evenly. Through Amazon you can get them at a reasonable price. I only wish they carried more! I really like them and wouldn't use anything else. The commerical is a little harder to clean and the flat black finish makes the food seem to disappear when wet.
5,GREAT PAN,BOUGHT PAN'S FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO BOTH USED THEM AND SAID THE REST OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS CANNOT USE THEM. THEY WERE THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT THAT I GAVE THEM. I HAVE ONE OF MY OWN AND USE IT ALL THE TIME.
4,I use the Everyday Pan more than any other pan I own.,"I've used the pan on the stove and in the oven to prepare meals. I love the not-to-tall height. It can hold a lot because of the arched lid, yet it's two-handled style makes it easy to grip."
4,Everyday pan used everyday.,This pan actually saves a lot of time by letting me use one that is a bit smaller than my wok and lighter than a deeper fry pan. Can just leave the one cleaned pan on the stove for tomorrow. Easier to handle and clean and has good sealing lid. Very good general purpose for those jobs that don't need something only that special pan will do. Glad I Bought it.
4,What a deal!!!,"This pan is such a great deal. I thought I would find it difficult to get used to having two small handles instead of one longer one, but it has not been a problem.The heat is conducted very well, and even if things get too hot and stick, clean up is very easy.I am very satisfied!!!"
1,Sticky Pan,I've tried many leading brands of pans and cookwares. Calphalon hard-anodized pan or pots are the worst of all. I've tried using differnt kind and amount of oil at differnt heat setting. The pan sticks to anything I try to cook. The only good thing is it's easy to clean as long as you soak it in warm water. I'll not buy another hard anodized product from Calphalon again!
1,Everything sticks to this pan,"I have read a lot of reviews which is why I decided to buy this pan. If you want a pan that everything you cook sticks to the bottom even when using non stick sprays and butters buy this pan. Doesn't matter how low the temperature is it will stick. Doesn't matter if you are on top of it stirring often, it will stick. I'm convinced that even water will stick to this pan."
2,Sticky!,"I thought this was going to be the same quality as the many other Calphalon pots and pans I own. It is NOT! The handles look cheap, and everything sticks to the ""non stick"" surface. It looks like a cheap knockoff. That was why it was so inexpensive, I guess."
2,why does everything stick?,"I read so many wonderful reviews here. But my experience was so bad. I tried it three times. I tried egg, tofu, and pancake. Everything sticks! And it took me an hour to clean it. It is totally unbelivable! I did everything on the instruction, like preheating, using medium heat to fry. I know this is not a non-stick pan. But, why still so many people have good experience? Is there anyone who can give me some hints on this? Thanks!"
1,Bypass this Pan!,"I purchased this pan almost two years ago. I have been nothing but disappointed in it, which is surprising because everything else that I have purchased from Calphalon is wonderful and worth every penny. This pan, however, is not! Everything sticks to it. All types of food and this is while using every nonstick spray, butter and many different types of oil to prevent the sticking. Nothing works. A few months ago, I had finally had it with this pan after cooking many aggravating meals with it. I went to Target and bought a similar Calphalon pan with a see through glass lid. It has been a wonderful replacement."
1,worst pan ever,"I followed all the directions and then cooked bacon in it, it stuck to the pan and everything else did too. Finally just threw it away and bought an Emeril cookware set, much better."
3,Attractive but NOT non-stick!!!,"I purchased this item expecting a non-stick surface, BUT IT IS NOT.Eggs, bacon, hamburg, you name it - works just like normal pans do.The surface is an attractive gunmetal color, and I've chosen to keep it, mainly because the handles and size are perfect for a family of five (stove top to table top).Cheers!"
1,Uses are limited if you want edible food.,"Have had this pan for about two months. Following the instructions with this pan is fairly useless. Everything will stick to it. E V E R Y T H I N G. It is, however, useful as a cat food dish for when we go on vacation."
3,"Size and handling great, but it sticks!","I purchased this product assuming that this was a non-stick product. I used this pan for my Thanksgiving dinner attempting ""grandma's"" fried corn for a group of twelve. Using a low heat setting I discovered that my corn stuck to the pan constantly even though olive oil was used. It was necessary that I monitor the cooking of my fried corn until it was done cooking. Upon finishing, I had to pick burnt kernels from my dish. I was rather disappointed in the product.I have ordered another Caphalon product to date. [I ordered it prior to my recent experience]. I hope that my other Caphalon product proves to be a better pan.Overall the handling and size of my caphalon 12"" pan was impressive."
3,"Caphalon Commercial hard-anodized 12"" pan & lid","What you can't see in the picture and description, is that this is lighter weight and made in China (other pieces are not). Still, for the money, it is a nice weight, and functions just fine. Handles are lighter weight material, too. Overall, appears like a knockoff--but a nice one."
3,Great Value - Mediocre Performance,"Even though I own a lot of Calphalon products, for some reason this pan seems to be extra sticky... No matter the fat I use in the pan, proteins stick. Doesn't matter, chicken, eggs, sausage, bacon etc it sticks.. The pan cleans up pretty easy though, and for the price I paid ($19.99), I can't complain. Though it is not an ""Everyday Pan"" for me, it will be a sometimes pan. It is a great design, maybe they just made a huge run of these and maybe they are 2nds."
2,good price ($20 got it on sale) but it sticks!!,"as mentioned in the title, i bought it when it was on sale, very good price for this brand. when i received it, it was shaallower than i thought, doesn't matter, however, it seems u need to put a lot of oil otherwise, it sticks quite a lot, cleaning seems ok, but still quite annoying as u couldn't only use it for one dish and then soak in the water and clean it the next day...i won't recommend to friends..."
4,"Yes, it's awesome. Yes, it's not non-stick.","Excellent pan. Hope it works over the long haul as it's supposed to do. No, it's not non-stick and yes some things will stick but once you get used to it you'll do fine and you'll really enjoy the pan. Terrific value for the price."
2,Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodizd 12 inch everyday pan with lid,"It sticks everything I cook in it, not a good product. I had few Calphalon product before, and I love them. But this one really changes my impression of Calphalon."
2,Not so good...,"I followed the instructions on cleaning, but the anodized coating came off and the pan began to look like it was rusted. Even after cleansing and drying, the pan never looked clean. I finally threw it out (after less than 1 year) because the orange rust look that couldn't be cleaned off was certainly getting into our food. Calphalon is usually a good product, maybe the anodized isn't all it's cracked up to be, as I had the same problem with their roaster."
1,"Non-stick, I don't agree",I read the reviews and thought this would be the perfect solution to my everyday cooking dilemma. But I found that a lot of things sticked to it even if I added butter to the pan. Grilled cheese would stick and then end up burning as I tried to salvage what was left of it. Pancakes sticked too. I tried different types of margarine. Now if you cook with oil it might work but for certain dishes I cook with margarine and I found it did not work well. I was able to scrap with metal utensils without damage to the pan though I found outlines of pasta on the bottom if they stuck to the pan even after scrubbing it clean.
2,Not a great find!,"I am so pleased with the other pieces of Calphalon that I have, so I thought I would add to the mix with the Everyday Pan. I have really struggled with using it. I should have ordered a NONSTICK Everyday Pan, because each time I have used it, I have had to scrape, struggle to get it clean, and spend a lot of time. It is not worth it to me. I need things that make my life easier, not more difficult. It has some great atrributes--size, presentation, etc., but not enough to make me want to buy another Calphalon pan with the regular finish."
1,finally got one in good shape !!,"Got it this afternoon, cooked in it tonight. Made philly cheesesteak... sauteed onions, bell pepper & mushrooms with olive oil & spices, & then the strips of sirloin. nothing stuck, cooked perfectly, I love it.I think of these pans as cast iron, only better. Non-reactive to foods, much lighter, and quicker to heat than cast iron. After I cleaned up, the cooking surface was discolored, almost coated. Perfect ! I don't need this pan to be pretty, just to cook great. This is what I loved about my Meyer profeesional 8"" pan I've had for 15 years. It's coated, discolored and seasoned, if you will, and is perfect for anything that needs to be seared or browned or carmelized. My wife bakes cornbread in that one, which comes out with that great bottom crust just like it was baked in cast iron.This pan's a winner, buy it."
5,I wish this shipped to the UK!,"Having done a lot of research, I can honestly say that American cookware appears to be vastly superior to what we have in the UK. (That goes for sheets and towels too, but that's another story...)If only Amazon.com shipped these (and Cuisinart too) to the UK...I've searched for them on Amazon.co.uk but no luck.An idea for the future, Amazon.com???"
5,Great Pan,"I've had a lot of pans, but they always have problems. They don't season properly. They don't have lids, so recipes that require putting on a lid are difficult. They stick. They get uncleanable stuff on the bottom and inside of the pan. I had enough, so I went looking for a quality pan. The reviews on this were a little mixed, but I took a shot.It was a good bet. This pan is awesome. I put a tiny bit of olive oil in this thing, put the flame slightly below medium, and it's ready to rock and roll. It cooks everything awesomely. Chicken, vegetables, curry, tacos, it's all good. Truly lives up to its name as an every day pan."
3,"Cook's Well, but discolored","The pan cook's very well. It also seems to be made well. However, after the very first time I used it the bottom became discolored... like the pan reacted with something. I didn't use anything acidity and I didn't put it in the dishwasher. Oh well still cook's fine."
5,Now I know what all the fuss is about,"I love this pan! I can honestly say that it has been used everyday since I received it! There have been no issues and I am buying more pans from the line! This is a great buy. I have baked, fried, broiled, and boiled in it....it is a one pot wonder."
1,I won't buy another Calphalon product!,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the ""everyday pan'! I misunderstood and thought it was non-stick because it was ""hard-anodized"", but every thing sticks to it, even when I use a little oil! After numerous washings I can not get the stains out! I only use it if I have to simmer something in a lot of liquid like broth."
1,Hard to clean,"I've used it a few times now. My food has burned because it gets stuck to the bottom, even with medium heat, and the rest of the food isn't cooked. I have an electric range which may be part of the problem, but I've never had trouble with any of my Cuisinart pans. This was not worth the trouble of me and I'm severly disappointed that with correct upkeep it looks like I've had it for years instead of 1 week."
1,Got a Defective One...,"Encouraged by the consumer reviews and great price, I got this pan. I used it only once for an omelette, and even soaking and scrubbing couldn't remove the residue. I have been cooking for 30 years and have never had a pan this hard to clean. I was rather shocked and of course, disappointed.I figured it must have a defective finish. Even the cover had a dusty appearance, and if you ran your finger over the surface, there was a visible mark, like there was a light coating of dust.I sent it back about 3 weeks ago, and Amazon says they haven't received it yet. Not too happy about that. I want my refund!"
1,Calphalon Didn't Live Up to its Name,I bought this pan last year this month and the coating has already disappeared. This pan is worthless and I will never buy it again.
3,Not a Quick Cook Pan,"Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, this pan is not for you. There is a lot of waiting-for the pan to heat up, for the oil to heat up and if you don't do it right you start all over. I wish someone would have told me....Very hard to clean even with recommended cleaning solutions and scrub pads and it's very heavy."
4,Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid,"Pan works very well. I use it almost every day. Since it is not Teflon coated, I sometimes have to scrub it a little but does a very nice job of cooking - even heating, etc. and things brown up nicely."
3,nonstick?,"the hard anodized pan was supposed to be non-stick, but it is yet to have any food cooking in it, that hasn't stuck all over. The size is right but...I already had a stainless pan that size w/ the same issues."
2,Not Happy,"I wanted to try Calphalon and the price was right. I read the enclosed documents on cooking and care, but food still stuck to it. Calphalon can not go into dishwasher. I also have the Calphalon non-stick 10"" saute pan and love it. It wipes clean with a paper towel and rinses out with soap & hot water."
3,Pretty and Sticky,I like the looks of this pan and the idea behind it. I made a frittata which I finished in the oven. The eggs stuck to this pan like glue...I had to scrub and scrub in spite of following the manufacturer's instructions and soaking after cooking. I don't get it. I bought it based on the great reviews instead of the nonstick...what a mistake.
2,Disappointing,"Does not hold up well....Size is great, but this is not the best hard anodized available. No more Calphalon products for me. Too thin, and not heavy duty. A real lightweight in more ways than one."
3,Chinese mfg cookware the same as Japanese 50 yrs. ago,"Not as heavy as the Analon 'Advanced' 8"" open skillet (or, for that matter, the Calphalon 'Kitchen Essentials' 8"" skillet). If this is 'commercial', I fear for the future of this company. My read is that it was certainly worth the low Amazon price, but the 'list' prices quoted are a ridiculous exageration. It would be nice if Amazon attempted to list the country of origin for all its cookware.You should definitely buy the heavier, 5-Star rated stainless steel Cuisinart. Priced the same, there really is no comparison.05/20/06: Trust me. The Cuisinart 12"" Chef's Classic everyday pan with medium dome lid is the same price. Buy that one and be very happy!"
1,Easily scratches,Arrived with a scratch right through the coating which looked paper thin. Based on another review (item is now made in China) I wonder if this isn't the same quality it used to be?
1,Did not live up to expectations,"When I received this pan, there was a long list of DOs and DON'Ts for proper care and use. (Don't put in the dishwasher, don't use cooking sprays, DO use plastic utensils, etc.) I believe I followed these rules exactly, yet everything I cook in this pan sticks like crazy, and has since the time I started using it. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Everything sticks!,I bought this with great expectations. What a disappointment! Everything sticks!I even called Calaphon and they gave me all these steps to go through every time I would use the pan and everything still stuck!Want one of these? Come to my yard sale and buy it for $2!
1,Sticks like crazy,I don't understand why Calphalon will claim this pan to be stick-resistant. It sticks even more easily than usual pans. EVERYTHING sticks even at low heat and a lot of oil.
1,Very disappointed,Every thing sticks to this pan. It rusts easily too. I followed all the caring and cooking instructions. Wonder if I can return it.
3,Quality pan but sticky,"Ordered this pan and by mistake thought it was nonstick. Everything cooked sticks to this pan. Can be cleaned but takes some elbow grease. Overall the pan is well made, and if a nonstick surface is important to you, DO NOT BUY THIS PAN!! It was my mistake but I still use it. For the price, hard to complain much."
4,great for everything!,"This pan lives on my stove. It's a great size for everything - deeper than a skillet but shallow enough make quick or high-heat cooking easy.This also cleans easily - no need for a dishwasher or abrasive cleaners.Unlike a normal skillet this pan has two small handles (rather than one long handle) which mean you need two hands to carry it.Still, after a year of using mine, I am finding it the most used pan in my collection."
5,Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid,"This is a great pan - we use it all the time for everything - eggs, stir fry, burgers, etc. One thing we learned is that once it gets hot, turn down the heat or everything will stick!"
3,a pan is a pan is a pan,"I was disappointed that this was not a non-stick pan, but I do like that it's just the right size and shape for a lot of my cooking needs (stove top to oven) braises, stews, paella, fries etc."
2,"Disappointed, Everything sticks to it","I purchased several pieces of Calphalon cookware/bakeware and love them EXCEPT this everyday pan. I made pancakes in the pan this morning. I accidently added too much oil to the pan but they stuck terribly anyhow. I had to throw the pancakes away. I attempted to fry eggs and it was a disaster. Hamburger has to be chiseled off of the bottom of the pan. I wrote an email to the company and they suggested preheating, letting meat sit out for 15 min and using metal utensils. My mother purchased a very similiar pan from the same company and loves it - no special preparation/instructions needed. I cook all of the time so it's not a lack of experience that's the problem. Many reviewers seem to love this pan so maybe I received one from a bad batch?? I received mine a few months ago."
2,Try Again,"I have a complete set of Calphalon purchased years ago that I love. I purchased this pan along with a 2 1/2 quart pan as gifts. Although I haven't used the pans because they were gifts, I was present when they were opened and they were indeed manufactured in China and not Toledo, Ohio. They were not the same quality as the Calphalon manufactured in the USA, the pans and the handles were rough and were nowhere near as ""weighty"" as my old pans. I would try again and make sure you get Calphalon made in the USA."
3,Good Pan,"This is not a non-stick pan. Great shape. Easy to clean. Food cooks evenly. I personally favor cast iron pans but you can't always use them. I encourage everyone to throw out their telfon pans. As soon as I switched over to cast iron and anodized aluminum, my food tasted better."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"I thought I would be able to season/condition this pot. But no go. Everything sticks. However, it does clean up easily enough, if I do it right away. I really like the pot design very much. 2 identical handles on either side. Makes for better maneuvering and handling. I wish it was deeper, though. I will use it, however, not very much. Because I am really a big fan of nonstick pans. All-in-all it is a nice frying pan if you don't mind that it dose NOT have a nonstick surface."
1,This pan STICKS!,"I agree this is a great size pan, but food STICKS to this pan more than any other pans I have had. When cooking fried rice, most of rice sticks to the pan!! The quality of ""hard-anodized"" surface is also questionable as it leaves stains after just one use! I would not recommend this pan."
2,Calphalon everyday pan...not so sure,Things seem to stick fairly quickly to the surface of this pan. They do wash out alright but the sticking bothers me. Not sure I'd buy it again.
3,"Functional, and a fair price -- just not the 'best' pan ever.","I bought this pan for somewhere around $20 from Amazon, and feel like I got a fair deal -- a solid pan which meets my need for a fair price. The pan itself is nothing to brag about - it's just a regular, 12 inch pan, large enough for most people's needs. The price is fair for what your receive.If you're expecting Le Creuset quality, look elsewhere (Le Creuset, perhaps?). If you're looking for a solid pan that'll last 10 years, and not feel cheap, this is likely the one for you."
2,Was broken or arival,Small piece in the middle of the pan broke off before the first use. Quality is not good
2,I am disappointed,"I needed a good all around pan and the reviews I read about this pan were above average, so I thought I buy it. For the price, I expected better. The first time I used it, my food stuck and after cleaning I noticed spots. I tried it again tonight making chicken cutlets. Using olive oil, it took quite awhile to heat up. I found it cooked the chicken too slowly and uneven. Turning the heat up, the chicken started to burn. Maybe I just need to get used to it but my cheap, non-stick pan does better."
2,Mediocre,"We bought this pan a year ago, to add to my kitchen arsenal. We had done some research regarding pans, and the good reviews prompted us to buy it. However, the finish has'nt lasted, inspite of careful handwashing & following the care instructions. This pan' performance is disappointing."
2,"Plain white box with ""made in China"" gave me a heads up","I purchased this pan because I like the fact that it does not have long handles and is something that would be used everyday.When this arrived, I didn't look at it right away. I had already purchased a Calphalon ""everyday pan"" that had the tri-ply stainless. I wasn't too concerned about this pan until I read one of the most recent reviews and opened it up!! SHOCK!This pan arrived in a plain white box without any indication that it was a Calphalon pan. In fact, there was a credit card offer in the box and I can only say that Calphalon should be ashamed of themselves. This is obviously a poor knock-off.This pan is going back to Amazon. The price was right but for a little more money, I got a much better pan and it even has a glass, see through lid.I have always checked to see what others think about products that they purchase. In the future, I think I will find what I want in the store and then try and buy it. What a disappointment."
3,SHOULD HAVE LISTENED,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND THIS BIG BARGAIN ON A CALPHALON PAN WITH LID.....MY FIRST PURCHASE FOR THIS BRAND NAME. I READ SEVERAL COMMENTS, SOME PRAISES AND SOME THAT SAID THINGS STICK WHEN COOKING AND THEREFORE YOU MUST EXERT A LITTLE MORE ELBOW GREASE WHEN CLEANING IT THAN THE MANUFACTURER DESCRIBES. THOUGH GETTING IT BACK LOOKING GOOD IS SIMPLY USING COMET AND A PLASTIC SPONGE, BUT, NEXT STIR FRY AND ITS BACK LOOKING SCUMMY AGAIN AFTER SOAP AND WATER CLEAN UP. I COOK ON MEDIUM HIGH AS SUGGESTED AND STILL THE FOOD HAS A TENDENCY TO STICK.....I GUESS I CANNOT LEAVE THIS OUT ON THE STOVE FOR DISPLAY UNLESS I USE COMET. NOT THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM, MORE OF A LET DOWN. EVEN USING PAM DOESN'T HELP."
5,Love it!,"Love it! This pan is so versatile & I liked it so much, I bought my four daughters one also..Great to use, great to give...Thanks, Amazon"
5,Great Value,I bought 2 of these - one for my mother and one for my sister. They both love the versatility of this pan. What a bargain for $20!
2,you get what you pay for,"The size of this pan is perfect, but cooking in it could be better. It does not seem to have a stick-resistance surface as stated...it is like constantly cooking on an unseasoned cast iron pan. For the money, it was OK, but I ended up buying another kind of pan elsewhere."
2,I am running out of patience with this pan,"I have given this pan a couple of months tryout and everything still sticks badly to it. I can't imagine trying to do an omelet in it! I have meticulously cleaned it after using it as directed since it says that a ""greasy"" or ""dirty"" pan will cause sticking, but to no avail. I have set food in advance out on the counter (to take the chill off) and have tried to follow the directions to a T. I always wait until the rim of the pan is hot to the touch until putting food into it to cook..... I have a ceramic cook top range. Is this causing problems with this pan??? I have pretty good luck with the lid on the food, causing steam, but stir frying in this thing is really tough. I don't think I will be buying another of this type."
1,worst purchase ever,"pot lasted less than thirty days. Rusted and chipped. Lid was fine. Recommend to NO ONE, unless you wish to waste money."
2,"calphalon, not all it's cracked up to be","I have had this product a few weeeks now and am very unsatisfied. I needed new pots and pans and bought a set of circulon 2 but the frying pans were too small. So I researched and ordered this pan, 12 inch everyday pan by cephalon. The reviews were generally good and cephalon was one of the top recommended brands. Everything sticks to the pan and I expected a flatter pan. This one has rounded sides and seems more for vegetables. Maybe saute' would not stick. I have used it several times hoping it just needed to be seasoned, but still I just don't care for the pan. I just finished making pancakes, only fit 3 small ones in the pan and they stuck even with lots of Pam spray. Maybe I am spoiled with the circulon 2, which is thicker and heavier and doesn't stick. My husband has used the pan too and he seeems to like it and that is the only reason I didn't return it."
1,Worst 30$ spent ever,First time I cooked I taught may First use but I tried 4 times and food still sticks to the pan. My old pan was doing the same thing so I bought this but now I regret buying this pan
1,Big Disappointment,"I love my Calphalon pans. They are of very good quality and although they are not of the non-stick variety, food never sticks. I was shocked when I received this one. The quality is obviously not the same. The pan is thinner and the surface not as smooth. The inside of the lid discolored on the first use and although I followed the maker's cleaning instructions, the discoloration remains.Also please note that although this is sold as a 12"" pan, only the top of the pan is 12"" wide (at the lid). The bottom of the pan is only 10"" wide and doesn't hold any more than my 10"" skillet."
3,attractive price - lasted three years,"Good pan for a very attractive price.When we purchased it, the pan was still described as non-stick. This it is certainly NOT. I would call actually more of a ""stick-pan"" than non-stick. Nevertheless it cleans up very well after a bit of soaking.The bottom of our pan de-formed after three years and looks now more like a wok. Thus I am looking for a replacement at the moment, likely a stainless steel pan."
5,ideal for everyday cooking,"marvelous! i had purchased the wok from calphalon prior to this, and I wish I hadn't! this pan is truly more versatile, since it is a wee bit smaller, and permits other pots to be on the other burners at the same time.. the wok is just too big... plus this pan is great for eggs benedict, since you can insert five small bowls (and water) within easily... it is great in the oven as well, i baked stuffed tomatoes and it cleaned up nicely. I love this pan, and I use it every single day..."
1,This pan is AWFUL - everything sticks to it!,"I own other Calphalon pans and like the quality, so I was really excited to get the 12-Inch Everyday Pan. I was doing a general stir fry the first time I used it, and a few pieces of the meat stuck to the bottom of the pan. Had to soak the pan for a couple of hours before I was able to get the meat off with a sponge without damaging the coating. Of course, I thought it was user error, so I gave it another try the following week. I was pan frying a large batch of delicious home-made meat dumplings in a generous amount of cooking oil, and every single one of the dumplings stuck to the bottom of the pan like it was cemented in place! My entire batch was ruined and I will never use this pan again."
3,Equal to Walmart pans,I am not impressed with these pans. I thought they would be like my Ultrex line that has been discontinued (from chipping) but I wasn't feeling it... I thought I could have saved a bundle and just have bought one at Walmart. i also read on how to use them properly (a MUST) but just wasn't impressed.
1,Worthless to me,"I know that this pan is not nonstick but copious amounts of oil don't help. And after 3-4 uses, the surface is all scratched up and the metal is showing through. It has become too much of an event to use and clean this pan - it's going to goodwill."
1,BEWARE,"Buyers Beware. I have been an amazon customer for years. I read all the reviews and was ready for my Calphalon pan to arrive. You will also note that this item was sold , not from a third party distributor but from Amazon itself. What I received was not the Calphalon pan I ordered but a Chinese knock off. I was shocked. It came in a unmarked white box with ""Made in China"" Printed on the outside. No where on the box or inside the box or even on the pan does it say Calphalon. Slipped in with the pan was a single general brochure for Calphalon cookware. I looked at the picture of the pan in the brochure and it didn't even look like the one in the picture. The handles were different, the marking were different and it looked like, well a cheap knock off. I am sending mine straight back to Amazon.As a loyal Amazonian I am just floored."
3,It is what it is,It is not non-stick and I knew that. It does take lots of oil to keepfrom sticking. Heavy duty and goes in the oven too.
1,totally unusable after a little while,"we've had ours for a few years and it has gotten progressively worse as the finish quickly wore off and disappeared, even on the lid which we don't use a lot. Washing it with a soft sponge turns it completely black, and magically, after getting rid of all the blackness, it's back the next day. I shudder to think what amount of metal or other material has gotten into our food-- thoughts that convinced me to finally carry it to the trash can today. That 30 feet of holding it turned my hands black, but I can at least be happy that it won't again. Replacing it with All Clad-- have some of those which get heavy use and haven't let me down."
1,Poorly made product,"OK, I cannot accurately comment on how the pan worked because I never got to use it. Amazon shipped it and I found that the lid was dented, which then led to fact that it didn't properly fit on the pan itself. Also, there were scratches on the bottom of the pan, as if someone had scoured it, which I didn't think was too normal...The cheap price should have tipped me off...."
3,Everything Sticks !,"Cleanup can be surprising easy after soaking, but everything sticks to this pan. Bacon, hamburger, sausage, eggs, etc ... they all stick and leave residue in the pan that takes some soaking to clean up. I was comfortable with non-stick pans when I bought this and thought it was comparable ... no it's not. I like the shape and size of the pan, just not a fan of the surface."
1,Talk about STICK.......!,"Never, ever, have I been this disappointed with Calphalon anything. The reviewer who described it with ""one issue"" is right. I don't think one could fry lard in this pan without it sticking. And clean-up is, to say the least, tedious, no matter how long you soak it. I've used it twice, and that's it......the lid should be handy, I suppose."
1,The worst pan ever!!!,"I bought this pan for a my mother as a gift, and it is the worst piece of cookware she has ever owned. I must second everything Mr. David Burrell wrote below. Nothing can be cooked in this pan without sticking and burning. I wish I could give it zero stars rating, because one is way too much. Stay away from this pan!!!"
1,Poor non-stick pan,"I have used this pan only twice, the eggs stick badly. I have my everyday set of stainless pots and pans and bought this for cooking eggs and a few other items. It is a very light weight pan and of very poor quality. I generally have liked my calphalon pans, but this seems to be a knock-off item. It is very light weight and is not a non-stick cooking pan. You get what you pay for."
2,Food Sticks all the time,I was so exicted when I bought this pan. But the fodo sticks all the time unless I put a lot of oil. I am very disppointed. Can someone recommend what to do.
3,Pan Heaven - almost,Versatile pan. Perfect size for the one-pan meal for two or three people. Doesn't clean up as easily as I had expected.
4,a little shallow,i have a number of calpahalon commercial pots and pans. this one is my least favorite because it is a little too shallow to use as a pot or wok and a little to deep to use as a frying pan. however the quality of commercial grade calphalon is unmistakeable and when i do find a use for it i don't regret the purchase. i bought one for my mom and she loves it.
3,"China-made, lesser quality","I have several Calph products in my kitchen. I just purchased this pan and KNEW it was made in China before I even flipped the pan over to check. While it is still a quality pan compared to cheaper brands(I have a smaller pan also china-made that i use frequently), it does not have the Absolute Sturdiness of the USA made Calph pans and pots. My sauce pans, my 5 quart saucier, and my larger pot are all made in the US and have a wonderful thickness to them. I'm not talking weight, they aren't uncomfortably heavy. The sides of the US pots and pans just feel much more hardy while this pan feels more flimsy.**Edit**: I came across this review again and felt that while my comments were true enough, I'd like to comment that the size of the pan is quite handy for stir fry and other dishes that might require a bit of room. Although, I've re-fallen in love with my enameled cast iron frying pan for all manners of cooking thanks to it's high heat retention."
4,"Everyday pan, Everyday clean-up","I rated this pan 4 stars, however, I must state that I use this pan almost every day.The size of this pan allows me to easily cook, and even bake, a main dish for my family of three. I have used this pan to fry, to saute, and to bake. The color (charcoal gray) is quite nice to look at as well.However, this is what I find inconvenient: the clean-up. I follow the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning this pan. With that said, I have a difficult time removing some of the foods. There are several darker spots on the pan, which I know should not be there and, quite likely, they are caused by food residue. I am afraid to scrub too hard because I have read that abrasive cleanings can ruin the finish. It is for the above reason that, I have rated this pan only 4 stars, and not 5."
4,Calphalon 12-inch Everyday Pan with Lid,This Calphalon 12-inch Everyday Pan with Lid is a great pan. The lid can also be used on other saute pans too.
1,You can cook with it....,"....and it can be used in the garden with plants .... I can not imagine a better use!it's probably designed to burn the food or invit your guest to stay home next time.I just missed so much my Tefal when I was using that awful Calphalon! it's so cheap and everything stick for ever in there....I couldn't get away of the burned spots...anyway!!:my advice, don't buy it!"
2,"Ok pan, but not worth the money","I bought this pan about two months ago for the great reviews and cheap price on Amazon, I've used it a total of 5 times and I have to say I'm not at all impressed. What they don't tell you is that it's not that easy to wash and its not non stick. However, it does heat up quite quickly. I also wasn't to happy about putting it the dishwasher, as it had the ashy texture to it when it came out. Its extremely heavy as well. Not really worth the price but it does get the job done. Point being, Ive had better and paid way more less."
3,Hard to clean,To properly care for these you cannot put them in the dishwasher. That isn't fun. It is hard to get food out of the grooves. I have other Calphalon I love. I will not buy from this particular line again.
5,Still going strong after 5 years,"I have 15 pieces of Calphalon purchased over the last 5 years, mostly in the commercial hard anodized line. I've been happy with all of them, but if I could only have 3, I would keep the 12"" everyday, the 2 1/2 qt shallow saucepan and the 10"" nonstick crepe pan.The everyday pan is my favorite because you can do so much with it. From my kids making hamburger helper, to me cooking perfect shrimp or browning a pork tenderloin before finishing it off in the oven, its versatile and just the right size.And your sauces will never be as good in a nonstick, with all those crispy bits it creates.I use it quite a bit and haven't noticed any deterioration in the coating, although I only use wood and silicone utensils and no abrasive cleaners.I highly recommend these pans. I've already given my kids these pans so they don't have to struggle with cheap discount store pots like I had in college."
3,Good wok but hard to clean,This wok is good quality. But it's so easy to get food sticked on it. And it's so hard to clean. It has been my cupboard for a long time.
2,Food stuck.........................,"My husband used his pan for the first time last night.To his surprise, the pan did not do as well then all of our other Calphalon pans. The food stuck to it ,like white on rice.He could not believe it.Maybe we got a hold of a lemon.All of our other pans work like a charm, we bought a whole set in January."
2,Made a mistake here............,"My error. I thought I was buying a non-stick type pan. Not so with this particular Calphalon line. It is a nice size, nice lid as well. Didn't notice it didn't have a single handle. Getting it to cookproperly has been a learning process. If you want non-stick avoidthis one."
2,"Was 4 stars at first, but over time...","I was very excited to purchase this piece as it was my first higher-end pan. It heats up, and retains heat, very well. There are few hot spots using this pan, so cooking in it is great. However, clean up is another issue. I never put it in the dishwasher. I only used soft sponges to clean it. I usually cleaned it immediately after using it (once it cooled). But it appears like a layer of metal or whatever has worn off (is now dull instead of having a sheen). Since it's worn off, the food has been sticking A LOT more, so it's a cycle --> clean, wear off some metal, food sticks, repeat.I still use this pan, but have put a similar style pan on my wedding registry so I can replace it soon."
2,"Even with care, everything sticks","I bought this on sale for $30 several months ago. I have other Calphalon Hard-Anodized pieces, and thought this would be a great addition. Although I read the reviews and knew it wasn't non-stick, I figured I'd be able to deal with that, as much of the cookware I have is not non-stick. When the pot came, I was disappointed at how the food stuck to the bottom, no matter what. I followed the tips of other users, made sure I used oil, tried not to put cold foods in, and gave it several months of use. I still find that whatever is cooked in this pan sticks. Maybe the one I purchased is unusual or has a bad finish or surface. Whatever the source of these issues, I have been terribly disappointed with this pan. It's too bad, because it is the perfect size in terms of cooking surface, the curvature of the sides, and the lid."
2,Not what I'd expected. . . .,"Having purchased several pieces in the Calphalon line and being quite pleased with everything from the basic Simply Calpalon to the Commercial Non-stick line, this item left me disappointed. Not only was I saddened to learn that this ""commercial"" grade pan was not manufactured in Toledo as are other pieces of my collection, but the quality was less than that of the Simply line. Rough edges predominate the handles on both the pan and cover, the weight was less than other pans of the same size, and shipping or storage had left the pan with a dent to both it and the cover. Although it still manages to function as a brazier, it does not measure up to the quality one comes to expect from the Calphalon name."
4,An Everyday Pan that works everyday,"I have owned many pieces of Calpahlon over the years and they always have done exactly what they are supposed to and then some.The nice features to this pan are the slopped sides and included lid. These features make the pan something of a hybrid but a hybrid that works.I have used it to bake in, make soups and chili as well as pan fry on the stove."
4,Not to shabby,"I own plain old copper pans. I hate non stick. So I thought we'd try something new and I think this is a pretty good pan. Food will stick if you run it too hot. It takes some practice, but a good product. I will be buying more of these."
2,Poor pan!,"This pan is extremely difficult to clean, even when following the written instructions. I am very disappointed with this product. Do not recommend buying this pan at any price."
1,Worst Pan Ever,"Everything sticks to this pan. This pan is dreadful for sauteeing, frying, searing or just about anything else. It does hold water though and if you have a high enough water content in your food, like a soup, it won't stick. But this is not supposed to be a saucepan. I cannot believe all the positive reviews. All my other Calphalon Commercial pieces are fine. Believe the reviews that say that this pan is just not the same quality!This pan IS THE WORST. You will BE SORRY YOU BOUGHT IT."
3,Not Calphalon's best,"I buy alot of Calphalon pans and I have been very happy with them until now. I wanted this pan to replace my Wok. It is large enough and when I received it, I was very delighted with it's large size. I cooked with it twice and on both times found the food sticking. Clean up was a nightmare on both times but the last time was the worst. The black marks took alot of scrubing to remove.I would not recomend this pan if you have used other high end pans in the past, It does not work as well as Calphalon's other pans."
2,Disappointing for Calphalon,"I own a good amount of high end cookware, and do a large amount of cooking. I own several pans in the Calphalon Commercial line, including this pan. This is the perfect size pan, and that is originally why I purchased it, but other than it's size, it's useless. Everything sticks to this pan, even when the pan is greased. It's been very frustrating to cook with the pan, and find out that your food is stuck to the pan. Cleanup is diffcult. I wash all my pans by hand, to preserve them, and this is the most difficult pan to clean. It still has marks on the bottom pan where food stuck while cooking. I read previous reviews and followed the advice about cleaning the pan, but it still looks the same. I've decided to order a pan from a different line."
3,Good but not great. Food sticks.,"I have a half a dozen calphalon pans, and I like them all. Unfortunately, this is the weakest of them as it does not share the non-stick coating that makes the others great. It is a very useful shape and size, but the fact that food sticks to it and cleaning it is a chore only earns it a 3/5 rank."
3,non-stick would make it great,"This is my first hard-anodized pan, which I bought for use on a smooth-top range; it's heavy and flat, which makes cooking even. I suggest not turning the heat up past ""8"" to keep the pan flat. The weight and size of the pan are great, and I love the handles on both sides for safe transport to the table, but with hind sight, I should have bought the non-stick 10-inch, although it wasn't offered. I use it for casseroles with noodles or rice, which stick more than when I use my old non-stick pan. This size is good for my young family of 4 kids."
2,Not for light meals or stir fries!,"I've never used a pan that makes food sticks to the surface like this one does! I cook a lot of stir fries and light, non-greasy food and buying this pan is a huge mistake. This pan is probably good at searing big slabs of meat and creating gravies but definitely not for preparing delicate food for thinly sliced pieces of meat will stick onto the surface and it takes a lot of soaking and scrubbing to clean them off."
3,this pan is not for everyone!,"I was not impressed, The pan sticks , and is hard to clean.Even on the lowest heat is does not perform well. I would not buy it again!"
2,Sticks everything,"I used to own Hard-Anodized Non-stick pan. It was a very cheap pan but it did work for good 5, 6 years. Since I bought this one from Amazon, I just made the last scramble egg in it and toss that out. Now, I used this brand name Calphalon pan, everything sticks! I mean not only eggs, but everything. I am thinking getting another cheap pan just so that food will come out the pan!"
4,Almost a Wok,"This pan works pretty well. I'd like the bottom to be a bit thicker for even heating, but for Wok-like cooking (high heat, constant stirring) it's a winner."
4,Nicely surprised.,"Reading all the reviews, pro and con, I decided to buy one pan of this product, before buying the entire set. After cooking with it, I will buy the entire set. As in the other reviews, the food will stick until it's released, searing in the flavor. If you try turning your food before that, it sticks! They are easy to clean if you soak them in warm soapy water. Great product!"
5,GREAT PAN,"THIS IS ONE GREAT PAN - AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE. I USE IT EVERYDAY FOR PASTA, CHICKEN AND HOT DISHES AND EVEN STIR-FRY. THE TWO HANDLE DESIGN MAKES IT EASY TO CARRY. THIS IS A STICK RESISTANT PAN, SO BE SURE TO USE A LITTLE COOKING SPRAY OR OIL."
4,Use it often,"Although this is NOT a non-stick pan, if you use just a little olive oil things do not stick. It heats up quickly and evenly. Have and would buy more pots/pans in the same line."
5,Great pan-,"Wow!! - I bought this from Amazon in '06 for $30 and can't believe it's been that long already and it costs so much more now. But, it's a great pan, good quality and will last. It's non-stick if you use it right, heat it up hot, put oil in, heat that up and add in your food to cook. Or if anything sticks, just add a little water or broth to de-glaze and make gravy."
1,2 Words........Buy Nonstick,"I bought this pan based on the name, price, and the reviews other people have written. I have had this pan less than 2 weeks, and everything sticks to it....onions, hamburgers, hash browns, even hot dogs.....and i have used olive oil everytime.......more than i should have to use for any given dish...fry eggs???? hah.....no way...I'm buying a nonstick...."
1,WORST PAN EVER,This is the worst pan I have ever had. Following all instructions from manufacturer; the pan burnt the food the first time and every time since then. Don't waste your money!!!
4,Excellent quality...,"The pan is heavy and seems to be very durable. It's not the least bit non-stick, so be aware of that before you buy. Eggs, pasta and potatoes stick like glue even under low heat."
5,"Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12"" Everyday Pan with Lid","After I figured out that you have to heat the pan before you add the oil and put the meat in to brown, I learned to love the pan. I also had to learn to turn down the heat so that the food doesn't burn. Once it gets hot, it is stays that way. I also love to be able to serve directly from it. I use it all the time. Mg"
4,Great value!,"This is an excellent all around pan good for many uses as long as you are aware that this is NOT a non-stick pan,and should not be put in the dishwasher, I got this in the Friday sale and it is a great value for the price.I use it primarily for stovetop meals or stews, braising or other sauce based dishes. Keep your temperatures under control (not too high) and use some oil or pam and sticking should not be a major problem.Most the complaints I have seen involve misuse or abuse of the pan. If you want it to last treat it like a $ 200 pan. Funny how we abuse an inexpensive pan like this then complain when it doesn't last. With a little proper use and care this is the best buy in cookware I've seen in a long time."
5,"Great, very versatile product","This is a good pan that you are able to use in a wide variety of ways. Its easy to clean. The pan also gets hot relatively quickly. I would not suggest buying this if you are unable to take care of it or if other people in your household are unable to take care of it. One of my roommates used this once, washed it while it was hot, and let it air dry and then the pan became discolored. I use this pan almost everyday."
3,A good pan,"I confess, I don't see what all the fuss is about. This is a good pan. It cooks well. (Though I've had some problems with things sticking, even when I use oil.)For the price I paid on Amazon, it was a good deal. I couldn't imagine anyone EVER paying full list price for it, however."
2,suprisingly poor quality finish,"I was very disappointed that the finish is easily scratched. The pan was in the sink waiting to be washed and I found it scratched pretty badly from I couldn't figure out what. There was nothing there that should have done that. My husband researched the finishes and thinks the infused finish must be the better quality one. I got this pan on sale, but it was originally pretty expensive. I'd say it was way too expensive for such poor a quality finish."
1,sent back to amazon,this isn't a user review because i mailed this garbage pan right back to amazon with two other calphalon pot/pans from the same line (commercial hard-anodized). the good reviews written about this and other calphalon cookware pieces from this line are dated. all recent reviews for the most part are negative because the product is from china not u.s.a. and the quality is crap. you can clearly see machined grooves on the surface and the handles just don't look like they are made good. i love amazon and have never returned anything to them before but honestly they shouldn't sell this line from calphalon. even calphalon doesn't sell it on their site (i wonder why?). i opted for analon products and so far i am very pleased. they also have sales on their site which are better than some of amazon's prices. if you want quality non-stick without breaking the bank then check out analon advanced cookware. hope this helps save some people the cost of return shipping.
1,sticky pan with handles burn your hand,"I cook everyday, but I have to say this pan is very disappionting. :-(1. It STICKS more than any stainless pan I've used, that's unbelieveable.2. The thin handles BURN my fingers, and they are difficult to work with when I do stir-fry, such pan should have a long handle that allow you to pour the food out, with ease.3. It takes longer to heat up than stainless one.I wonder how it got such good reviews. I will never buy Calphalon again."
2,"Bad Quality ""disposable"" pan...","I purchased this, and the small sauce pan right before the holidays, as they were on sale for a great price. I thought Calphalon was a reputable brand. I have used Magnalite Anodized Aluminum Cookware for YEARS, and it was finally showing some wear. For health reasons, I knew I had to replace them once the dark coating wore off to show the shiny aluminum. When the pots arrived, I noticed that they were paper thin, compared to the Magnalite, but decided to give them a try. I never wash my pots in the dishwasher, and follow all recommended cooking and cleaning instructions, yet the dark coating has already wore off the bottom of both of the pans I ordered in several spots. (within a month of use) I know for sure that this is a health hazard, and the pans are now useless.PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PANS!"
1,Very bad!! Worst pan ever!!,I hated this calphalon. Food sticks everytime and cleaning is a nightmare. I am almost at the point where i want to just throw it away. Will never buy again.
3,China vs Ohio,"This pan was made in China. The five other pans were made in Toledo, Ohio.I like the design of this pan but everything sticks to it and it is harder to clean. I am going to lower the heat and season the pan from now on, as per suggestions from other reviewers but my next piece will be from Ohio. I will keep the pan but I am disappointed."
4,"Great pan, even on ceramic top stove","My mother bought me a ceramic top stove, and while I am very grateful since our old stove was decrepit, I would really have prefered gas. However, I was greatly heartened after useing my Calphalon hard anodized on the cooktop.It works great on the ceramic top!! It takes a much lower temp to cook than the old electric and my stirfry came out better than in my well loved wok. My husband has used it for breakfast foods and his egg scramble cleaned up beautifully!This style is also a great space saver on the cooktop, even though it has a large diameter, without a handle we can use pans on the surrounding burners without overcrowding and knocking the pans off center.At this price don't even try to resist!!"
4,Great price for a great product,I think that this pan is great. It is non stick and that is why I like it. You can use it in the oven or on the stove. Just an all around great pan.
2,Think twice about this item,"I have seasoned this pan three times and still, EVERYTHING sticks!!! I am an experienced cook and have never been so disappointed! Also, you cannot use cooking spray with this pan as the manufacturere does not recommend it. I do have to say the lid fits nicely."
1,I haven't received it yet!!!!,"I haven't received this item yet. It has already appeared on my credit card bill, though. I just wrote to the seller asking whether it had been shipped. How do I get my money back?CTA"
1,hard anodized does stick,according to Caliphon customer service: 'the hard anodized product is not a no-stick product'. They have a video explaining how to use it. I'd rather purchase a Wal-Mart special at 1/3 the price then this hard anodized product. Unfortunately I missed the return date for Amazon and now am stuck with a sticking pan. It is too large for a paper weight.
2,Not truly non-stick,I was disappointed with the non-stick claim. It sticks. Maybe over time it gets better.
1,FOREVER STICK Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid,THE WORST PAN I have ever purchased. EVERYTHING STICKS. Going back to my old brand. I will NEVER buy anything Calphalon again. NEVER EVER!
2,CALPHALON NON STICK PANS,"These non-stick pans are not what one expects in performance. The pan can not be used with high heat or the teflon coating peels off. If you wish to sear food on high heat it is a big problem. I do not feel the company totally prepares or informs the user adequately to this major malfunction. I informed the company of my displeasure and was told to send the pan to them, at my cost, for evaluation, Meanwhile; I am out a daily used frypan. I would not buy an overly costly Calphalon non stick product again. All my pots and pans are starting to show signs of deteriation. Not what I expected for my $500.00 investment."
1,This is the worst pan that I 've ever used!,"This is the worst pan that I've ever used in the past 15 years!When I ordered this pan, I thought this should be a non-stick pan, but the first time I used for chicken, it was very sticky and chicken meat sticked to the pan and broke into pieces and looked a big mess. Oh terrible! I hate this pan and would never buy this brand of utensils any longer! I am very disappointed after using it."
3,not anti-stick,"The Pan looks like very good. And it is cute. However, it is not non-stickness as the produce description."
2,Opeind Review,This Item has'nt been shipped to me. I ordered it on 12/19/06 and the amazon site says it will be shipped on 3/28/07. Thats it nothing more to say. I am disappointed with Amazon this time.
1,JUNK,Listen to the bad reviews. I didn't and regret it.From day one this pan has been awful. I couldn't even cook bacon without half of each slice sticking to the pan's bottom. BACON! It gives off grease as it cooks for christ's sake. I had to scrape the slices off the bottom of the pan. This pan exhibited NO non-stick behavior what so ever.[...]
1,"Sticks, Sticks, Sticks!!!","After reading and following instructions for first-time use, I attempted a large cheese omlette for my family.. What a disaster!!! Not only could I not get it loose to fold it over, I had to pry it out in pieces. The omlette ended up being a scramble. To get the pan clean, had to soak it in hot water, then use scouring powder and a Scotch-brite pad. I'm giving it to Goodwill..."
1,Anodized not for frying,"I bought this Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid in order to try to get away from non-stick surfaces that may affect your health. My health is in greater jeopardy now because I want to jump out the window after using this piece of junk. I've used 12"" non-sticks to cook eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, etc. for 25 years, and I'll be buyiing a new non-stick today to replace this garbage product. I read all about cooking with anodized cookware on the instructions and on the Calphalon website. Cooking with oil is a deathwish in this pan, food sticks like it is coated with contact cement. The best results came from cooking with butter, but who wants to do that all the time? I am severely disappointed with this item, really hoped I would be able to move away from non-stick surface coatings"
3,Nice pan for the price,"I purchased this pan a few years ago - still in use, but do nearly my favorite, mainly becasue food tends to stick to this pan. The pan is solidly constructed and should last and at $30 the price is nice too (I hope nobody ever paid the list price of $150 for this pan...ouch)."
5,Very nice pan,"I have had good luck with the Calphalon products, Amazon has occasional mark downs on Calphalon pans and thats when I buy them. Amazon is a great company to order from they always keep you informed about every step of the order."
1,"Calphalon Commercial 12"" Pan w/lid",Was very disappointed in my pan. I did everything it said to do and my food stuck and left 2 white spots on the bottom. Looked like coating came off. Am trying again though.
1,Awful pan,"This pan is cheap because it is awful. Every thing sticks on it. I threw it out, and I'm going to buy a better one like I had before. It was very expensive but you get what you pay for."
2,Food sticks,"I am disappointed in this pan as food gets stuck VERY easily to it and it's not easy to get out. I guess the only consolation is that I can use a steel brillo pad to get all the stuck food off and it doesn't seem to really affect the pan. The listing says it is ""stick resistant"" but food sticks more to this pan using more oil than using a regular stainless steel pan with less oil."
1,horrible,I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT. EVEN WITH OIL EVERYTHING I COOKED IN IT STUCK REAL BADLY. I THREW IT IN A LOCAL DUMPSTER.
2,Amazing Calphalon Pan,"As a personal chef, this pan is great for mutiple uses. The width of the pan helps cook food fast and maintains flavor."
2,heavy pan,this pan is too heavy for me. i much prefer the circulon elite 12 inch covered deep skillet.
1,Worst Cookware Ever,I own other Calphalon pieces. I've owned better cookware from Walmart that cost less than 15 dollars. This piece is useless. Everything sticks to it. It is impossible to clean. I literally threw it away after owning it for 3 months.
4,Seems Fine,"I bought this to replace my cast iron skillet, since we bought a stove with a ceramic cooktop. Nothing will ever be as good as the cast iron skillet, but this one is basically okay. It sticks rather badly sometimes, encouraging the use of more oil than warranted, but I can live with that. Doesn't have the ""good vibes"" of cast iron, and probably not the health benefits, either!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I just finished this book last night--I read it at one sitting, something I haven't done in a while with any book. I found the story quite moving and interesting. I guess if you like Ludlum and Cussler you might not find it exciting, but there are other kinds of excitement besides car crashes and airplanes exploding."
2,A shadow of a novel,"I didn't like this. I found much of it pointless and unnecessary. It was essentially the hero's encounter with the girl he loves but can't have (vintage Hemingway fare), where they rattle on about the Italian war (or is it WWII?) and bemoan their fate several times.Nothing much happens; there was no climax, no plot movement. The dialogue is plodding and unrealistic to the point of disbelief. In this I was especially disappointed, given Hemingway's usual skill with dialogue. It seems like a shadow of a novel. The kind of novel a tired, old man would sit down and write, a story not *about* the war but a story about a man looking back and talking about the war, in a very long-winded and obscure fashion to boot. It had no life or vitality to it ... and this lack seemed to reflect as much from the author as from the book itself."
1,A tired parody of Papa,"From a longer post about it on my 5cense blog:I didn't mind so much that it was slow & nothing happens, it's just i couldn't relate to Hemingway's tedious version of nothing--sitting around in bars ordering drinks & cooing in lovey-dovey baby-talk. Or hunting with other men, stewing, not speaking. Perhaps you need to have fought & been wounded in a world war to appreciate it (or deserve the affections of a young nymph such as Renata despite the fact that you are an old grumpy prick). But to me, in 2011, it just seemed a tired parody of Papa."
1,Inane and annoying,"When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along. This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice. Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book. It is self-indulgent and inane. If the use of the phrase ""don't be rough,"" (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of ""I love you, whatever that means,"" should do it. I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful."
1,Papa Hemingway at his Pathetic WORST.,"You won't find a bigger Hemingway fan than I am, but this book is such a disappointment I couldn't even finish it. Of course, when Papa was knocked down on the canvas after this one (for an eight count), he got up and wrote The Old Man and the Sea just to show 'em who's boss...he was his own Hemingway code hero by this time and such and icon... I just hope his wannabe main squeeze Adriana (the 19 year old model for Renata) made it worth his while..."
5,NO MIDDLE GROUND,"you'll either love it or hate it. basically if you can accept that love transcends age, then the excellent writing, like a fine painting, should win you over! i travelled to venice 33 years ago, and can attest to the way hemingway brings the city of long ago back to life; if only for the brief molment whilst you read this fine book. great story too!"
4,"A warm, sad smile","People always say ""It wasn't his best."" True, but then ""not his best"" is far better than most. A simple yet, as with all Hemingway stories, deeply complex and aching look at life near its end. If you like Hemingway and appreciate his style, read the book with open heart and mind. It will put a warm, sad smile on your face"
2,Self-Indulgence,"I think Hemingway wanted to do two things: (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice. To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age. The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story. The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII. Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away."
4,Simply a good book,"Without going into details (since everyone else has done it so well), it's just a plain and simple good read. I think it's one of his best. And like all his works, it makes me feel like I have just walked out into the bright Latin sun."
2,A down book for Hem,"Easily Hemingway's worst book. After For Whom the Bell Tolls was published in 1940, Hemingway spent most of the 40s drinking more heavily than usual. In the late 40s he spent two or three years hanging about Venice with northern Italian upper crust types and was infatuated with a girl of about 21. He decided to write about this episode of his life and blend that story with the fact that he was closing in on a half-century in age. Result- disaster. The best thing about this novel is that Hemingway's pride was hurt by the withering storm of bad reviews from the critics. He wrote the gem The Old Man and the Sea a couple of years later and redeemed himself."
3,Again: Only for the Hemingway Fan,"Obviously written during a period when H. was in a retrograde orbit around his personal mythology; foreshadows his inability to make his aging present meaningfully co-exist with the exploits of his youth, both real and imagined; and is the victim of its own brutishly sentimental attempts to be anything but sentimental. Even though it's bad, it's bad in a way that only H. can be bad, which still makes it good, or at least better than most of the toilet treats passing for best-selling fiction these days. This was right before he re-captured the gold and glory with The Old Man and the Sea. H. was obviously trying to write himself out of depression, using his art to give him closure. The problem is, it mistakes yearning for honesty."
5,moving story an American colonel and an Italian Countess,"Imagine yourself sitting in a white chair under a tree during autumn. The wind gently blowing on your face and the leaves touching you as they fall down from the tree. This is the moment you would want to read a soft yet powerful story. What better than Across the River and into the Trees by Ernest Hemngway. Set in Venice, Italy, this is love story of an Italian countess and an arrogant American colonel. Though unsure about their future, all that matters to them is their undying love for each other. As time passes by they encounter doubts about their getting married.Promises of marriage, a home and family is just one part of the story. Will empty promises be kept by the Colonel? Read on and you would know."
4,"An underrated, understated, underread, underappreciated book","The book is not Hemingway's best effort, and consequently has a reputation of being a mediocre, thinly-disguised autobiographical sketch.The parallels with Hemingway's real life are obvious: The hero is an American WWI vet who returns to Venice at midcentury and falls in love with a much younger woman. But so what? Aren't writers told to ""write what they know""?The criticisms of this book chiefly stem from the fact that Hemingway wrote others that were better. But, judged on its own, it is an enjoya"
2,Hemingway's worst book by far,"This was - by far - Hemingway's worst book. Bad story, bad characters, bad dialog. Why does this 19 year-old countess care at all about this 50 year-old, ugly, divorced, poor, maimed, dying, bitter colonel? And despite 283 pages, all we get is a 2-dimensional cartoon character for the girl that he calls ""Daughter."" And, worse than the ridiculous story was the inane dialogue.""I love you very truly.""""I love you very truly, too.""...""Don't think of anything. Don't think of anything at all.""""I'm not.""""Don't think.""""Oh please let's not talk.""""Is it right?""""You know.""""You're sure.""""Oh please not talk. Please.""Over and over again. It's not just that it was late in Hemingway's career (1950). He wrote ""Old Man and the Sea"" after this. And, written later still, ""Dangerous Summer"" and, certainly, ""Islands in the Stream"" were much better works."
3,So so,"Not much happens in this book. Critics said it at the time, and Hemingway said, ""What do they mean, not much happens, why there are two wars, etc."" Well he was referring to stuff that was obliquely referred to in dialogue. But I have to say, I enjoyed this book in retrospect after I took my first trip to Venice, and rode in a gondola, and had a drink in Harry's bar. I was glad I'd read the book, then. So if you go to Venice, read this first."
1,"Looks Great, Doesn't hold water","Another leaky teapot! I've had this teapot about 2 years now and it developed a leak at the weld joint on the spout. I was going to return it, but after reading the other reviews the scrap yard sounds like a better place for it. Previous to this,I had another style anodized teapot from Calphlon, that one didn't last either. Maybe they should get out of the teapot business and stick to pots and pans."
3,needs an indicator,"I liked the look and it is a great size for most jobs. But unlike most of the tea kettles I have previously owned there is no visual/aural indication that the water is boiling. No whistle, no light nothing. As I am often doing multiple jobs in the kitchen, I really wish it had something. SO unless you are going to be checking it often, it is probably not the product for you."
2,Spout that spills and leaks....for shame!,"Who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily? since it doesn't make any noise that it is boiling, you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing. And what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways? Welding is a skill that if done right, it would NOT leak! The handle will get hot so wear your glove. On the plus side, the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place. I use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable (lasted 2 years) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more, it don't mean it would last longer. Mine start to leak after 4 months. I am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it.Overall, i cannot recommend this tea pot due to the spout flaw."
2,Problems!,After several months of use the spout leaks at the weld point. This is the SECOND time I will be returning this teapot for the same issue.
5,Calphalon Stainless Tea Kettle,"I have one sent one to my nephew when his new home was finished. He was so proud, he sent a picture of it sitting on his new stove in the kitchen."
1,Spout Rusted and Leaked After Three Months of Use,"If I could put a negative star on this product I would. I purchased this item becuase I have always believe that Calphalon made quality products. I was so disappointed when, after only three months of use, the spout began leaking. Upon further investigation, I noticed that the spout had rusted away from the body of the kettle! I then flipped the kettle over and saw the ""Made in China"" lable proudly stamped to the bottom of the kettle. I was no longer suprised that the kettle fell apart, just angry that I spent my hard earned American dollar on such a piece of junk. I'll never purchase Calphalon again - I'd be getting the same quality from an item purchased at WalMart."
1,Unusual mineral leakage/deposit,"I used the kettle for about 2 months before it began to leave hard to clean deposits inside the kettle. After regular cleaning and observation, I believe it's not the water I'm using that's the root cause. There's a certain 'mineral' leak at the weld/rivets of the handle to the body that's causing it. My guess is glue/gum is being used as part of the process to attach the handle, and it's being melted away by the constant high temperature usage.This is one of several kettles I've owned and by far the most one. I thought by putting more money into it, I'd get a better quality product. It's back to shopping for a better one."
2,Calphalon,I had to return not one but two of these kettles as the spout leaks(at the weld point) after a couple months of use.
1,Condensation & Water Collection,"I do not like this product. I bought this to match my stainless steel appliances and I do not use it that much. When left on the stove unused and empty, produces condensation on the inside of glass top and water collects on the bottom. It also leaves hard to clean spots on the inside bottom of tea kettle where the water collects."
1,5 Stars Until It Leaked,"I spent a great deal of time last fall searching for the perfect tea kettle. I absolutely loved this one. It was sturdy and held a lot of water. No whistle was the only drawback. Then it started leaking suddenly one day and almost a full pot of water quickly drained into my ceramic cooktop. I was afraid it had ruined the stove. It leaked under the spout. After reading other reviews, it seems that I'm not the only one to have this problem. It's a shame because it is one of the only kettles that doesn't have a handle get in the way of filling it and has an attractive design. Now I'm back to square one! Anyone have a good suggestion for a replacement?"
3,Beautiful design....too bad!,"This teapot is great looking and I always get lots of compliments! Love the stainless steel, handle, lid, etc. I like the tight lid because I know that it won't come off when I pour. I have not had a problem with the handle being too hot and I don't mind that it doesn't whistle. Everything about the kettle is great - but one thing.... It absolutely does fail over time. It leaks where the weld is on the spout. What is up with that? In the past, after returning it to the store where I purchased it, I have been given a new pot for no additional cost. I plan to do this again. But I don't understand why this one flaw has not been corrected by Calphalon?? Surely they are aware of the problem."
2,Great until spout fell off...,"We used this kettle for several years, and it worked just fine. We did have an issue with getting our hands burned from the steam, but kept potholder handy to solve that problem. The main reason we are not using it anymore is that while filling my cup one day, the spout fell off into my tea. OOPS! Thats not right!Called Calphalon to see about having it replaced, but was informed that they dont offer it any more. They said to ship it back and they would give me a certificate to use for another Calphalon product. Bottom line: It was ok, until it fell apart."
2,Weird Jeans,"These jeans are terrible, when I finally get them on I feel like a wool mermaid.If I want to move I have to do the worm. I gave them two stars because my worm skills are so premium now."
5,Best quality for the price,"I got this as a christmas gift for the GF, i looked online and in the stores, i could not find anything even close to this quality, this is a 1/3 carat diamond earings with a certificate that has the serial number for the earings and a picture. H-I, SI1-SI2. very good cut, color and clarity, the one i received is a little different from the picture; it has a six prong setting instead of four which is better IMHO, the diamond will not fall, i would like it in white gold but could not find a good quality one with my budget. As for the seller, very good product, excellent price, fast shipping, i can not complain"
5,Enormous single! 4 x platinum!,"Like most people I really love Shannon's monster version of What About Me off the album, That's What I'm Talking About, which has been one of the biggest selling singles in Australia's music history.The original writer, Garry Frost of Moving Pictures fame says Shannon's version of What About Me is the best he has heard by far. Garry also says his kids now call Shannon Noll ""Santa"" after his enormous success with this song.The B side track The Way That I Feel is an excellent addition to the single, written by Shannon and his brother, Damien."
4,Solid Comedy-Drama,"In Entre Monjas Anda El Diablo(1973), a Catholic schoolteacher, Maria(Angelica Maria), falls in love with Vicente ""El Diablo/The Devil"", a guy who raises fighting roosters. Don Carlos(Rogelio Guerra) covets Maria. Sara Garcia(El Inocente), Ahui Camacho(Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia), Felipe Arriaga(El Coyote y La Bronca) and Alma Rosa Aguirre co-star. This film is a real gem from Mexico's past and its tame enough for the whole family...and TV airings. Angelica Maria looked very lovely at the age of 29. Interestingly, she appeared in more TV shows in the 1970's than movies. There's amusing scenes such as orphans accidentally hitting Vicente Fernandez against a post...or a rooster pecking Angelica Maria on her rear end! Some scenes are corny, but this film is a must-see for fans of Vicente Fernandez and Angelica Maria. It's 85 minutes of joy."
1,"waste of money, a waste of effort for Madge","After waiting for the new Childrens story teller to come up with something new, you get some reshambled effort of a fantastic disco classic, murdered by Madonna's lamist lryics to date. I think most can agree, she is no expert when it comes to lyrics, but this is awful, did she dream them up whilst riding her horse? At first most would love this song, but it is not a timeless dance classic of her earler career, if this is the first taste of her new album, I may think twice about buying her album. Maybe she should stick to acting, but then again, she isnt very good at that, especially after destroying her husbands directing career."
3,Hung Out!,"Arguably for Madonna, she has always found unique ways to bring herself back as a diva, and a comeback is really what she is hoping for. After her last album, the ill-fated dissapointment American Life, her songs still remain as a constant all around this industry. Her latest single, Hung Up is a more bass dance, driven song that still blends in astrue to Madonna's ever-chaning and evolving image. Nevertheless, it isn't one of Madonna's best songs ever, but it does still show that she is still survivng. The song isn't all that bad, and it still beats songs from manufactured acts like Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears anyday.Song: C+"
2,"Great Song, Great Album, So-So Maxi-Single","I'm a big Madonna fan, so with great remorse I write this, but it's important that I do. There is nothing spectacular here. The only worth while mix is Tracy Young's mix, otherwise disposible. The album is excellent though.I give the maxi-single a generous 2 stars."
1,She needs to hang it up soon,This is one of the worst songs I have heard.It made me sick after hearing it.This single is a turd.DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING IT.YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY.AVOID THIS CRAP and get FOOL FOR THE CITY from FOGHAT instead.
5,Hung Up is Breaking Records!,"Madonna breaks McCartney Top 10 recordPosted: 19 November 2005 - From Everyhit.comMadonna has entered the singles chart at Number 1 with 'Hung Up.' In doing so, she has secured her 54th Top 10 hit and overtaken Paul McCartney - including his tally with The Beatles, Wings and various other guises. Though both artists trail somewhat behind Elvis' 76 and Cliff's 65 Top 10 hits, they are an elite group; no other artists have had 50 or more Top 10 hits.Other significant Madonna chart facts....-Longest span of Number 1 singles for a female solo artist-Most Top 40 hits for a female solo artist-Most weeks spent on The Top 40 by a female solo artist-Most number 1's by a female solo artist-Female solo artist with most weeks at Number 1"
5,FAB!,"Great mixes. I especially like the Bill Hammel Remix and the Chus & Caballos Remix. I also liked the Tracy Young remix but it was way too short (not sure why they put an edit on this disc). I'm already awaiting remixes on the future singles whatever they may be.BTW, has anyone had problems with putting the disc on your computer?? I wanted to put the disc on my I-Pod but I-Tunes does not recognize it. Same with my other burning software, Nero. Is there some kind of anti-burning technology on the disc?? Kinda bummed out...But still 5 stars for the remixes!!"
3,How they RUINED the SPD extended mix,"As a lover of the original mix of this song who longed for an extended version with the incredible break and build up in the video, I'll never get over the fact that the extended version COMPLETELY leaves out the entire ""I can't keep on waiting for you"" part, which is the only thing that changes up the back and forth between verse and chorus in the original version! For me, the definitive long version of this song is the album version."
3,It's OK,"Ok, this first track is a great one but that can't be said for all the tracks on this remix CD. The SDP extended versions are great to dance to, the other tracks I never heard in the clubs in The Netherlands before. They're kinda boring, they don't give you the energy to get up and dance to, like one mix suggests. But 3 out of 6, well 50% isn't too bad, that's why I've rated it with 3 stars."
4,"Excellent mood music, very listenable, very ancient feel","This CD's almost worth it just for the first track.I really enjoy this CD. I'm no music expert, but I think some ancient or ethnic music tends to either be monotonous or just plain weird to the Western ear. This is not one of them. It's at times dark, mysterious, playful, melodic, and overall sets a nice mellow mood. I found it indispensable for my Roman dinner party. My only (small) complaints are that the vocals sometimes seem a little over-the-top (probably much intended to be theatrical) and the volume of the tracks is uneven (some are much softer than others). I enthusiastically recommend this CD - good, reasonably-priced pre-Medieval music is tough for me to find. This is it."
4,Stiff toy,"My son bought this for himself and for the price I suppose should not have expected articulation, but he was a little disappointed that he couldn't move it like his other stuff."
2,Not very informative,No one in my class liked this text. If you knew nothing about disaster mental health topics than it may be helpful.
4,"Sturdy, light, clear, and cheap","An excellent value for the price. The only limitation is they're too close to wear with sunglasses. But they're quite comfortable and effective, with only a little visual distortion."
5,Que bien Keane.,"Keane lanza un segundo trabajo impresionante.El ""Hopes and Fears"" fue un muy buen CD.Este,a mi parecer,es mejor.Las letras traslucen angustia,cierto desconcierto,mucho temor.Musicalmente,estos chicos tienen un gran talento.Mucha armonía,mucho ritmo a lo largo de TODO el ""Under the Iron Sea"".Hay mucho de genialidad aquí.Hace algún tiempo no escuchabaalgo tan realmente bueno.Bien por la música.Gracias Keane."
4,Submergence,"Like so many bands to come of age since the turn of the century, Keane has absorbed the dynamics and mystery ofU2andRadiohead. ""Under The Iron Sea"" makes these bands touchstones, but also makes a tight, dark rock album. The anthemic ""Is It Any Wonder"" sounds like Keane clonedAchtung Baby, and this is said as a compliment. Same with the instrumental title track that leads into ""Try Again.""Lead singer and frontman Tom Chaplin faces the band's new-found trans-Atlantic success by trying to understand what the world looks like now that he's seen most of it. ""Atlantic"" and ""Crystal Ball"" ride a crest of pianos of keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley, Keane are also coming to terms with their own maturity. Catchy likeColdplaybut not as dramatic, grand likeMusebut lacking the bombast, ""Under The Iron Sea"" is a solid work of modern rock. It's also worth noting that the follow-up,Perfect Symmetry, is much lighter and poppier."
5,All heart and love,"I have been listening to rock n roll since the early '70s. Once in a decade or so a band comes along that leaves a lasting impression on me. It's not a matter of analyzing which particular songs are the best (other reviewers on this page have done a fine job of that). It just - the convergence of all factors into a total artistic sound that stays with me for years. Hopes and Fears, out for over two years already, it still holding steady on my playlist. Now this brilliant follow-up which I have been anticipating like a teenager and snapped up the first chance I could a couple of days ago. After about 10 spins I realize this one is probably even ""better"" than H&F - in the sense that it will likely sink deeper in my heart. And what to say about Tom's vocals - are they the sound of an angel from heaven? I had the good fortune to see them in Myrtle Beach last year and that show will remain with me forever. My deepest thanks to the lads for enriching my life so much."
4,Keane further improves their sound,"Although Hopes & Fears was a fairly solid debut, Under the Iron Sea seems a shred better for its good variety and simply more appealing melodies. My favorite track from the album is probably ""Atlantic"", which starts the CD off well with a really cool drum beat, emotional violins, piano, and then some soft vocals for an overall mystic and awesome tune. I also like the new hit ""Is It Any Wonder"" a lot, which uses a lively electric guitar riff to set the background beat and has an extremely catchy chorus. This song is somewhat different than the typical Keane track since the band never really used any real prominent electric guitars on their debut. Anyone who liked Hopes & Fears will likely appreciate Under the Iron Sea, although this album is a bit more outgoing and not quite as soft. I would give this CD four stars and would recommend it more than Hopes & Fears, though ""Bedshaped"" is still my favorite Keane song overall."
2,sold out,"i think keane sold out. their first cd was amazing and this one sort of fizzled and died. if they could reconnect with whatever it was that made their first one so great, they'd be back in business."
2,Mediocre and Boring,"I bought this album on advice from some ""friends."" I will start hunting each one down, and crush them with my Viking hammer. I'm more into metal, Prog rock, Blues/rock and Jazz. I was told this was a ""very Prog sounding album."" What this is IMO, is mediocre POP. There are 1 or 2 nice melodies, but that's it. I have given this at least 20 listens now and it just gets more boring. Once ""A Bad Dream"" is over I shut this off, for I can't take anymore. How appropriate for Keane to have a song called A Bad Dream. For this music is very similiar to having a bad dream. If you like the aforementioned styles of music, I strongly suggest that you avoid this at all costs. If you do like Pop music get some Pineforest Crunch and leave this in the garbage bin."
2,overdose,"I did like the first one, but with this one I can't get into it; even though the sound is still great it seems like they are overdoing what they did right the first time around, thereby turning sweet into sacarine."
3,Mediocre,"This is not truly a step down from their last album. (I still believe it is above Coldplay.) But this album is too smooth. There are just too many weak clichés and earnest heartfelt vocals. There is nothing original here and the band lacks any real substance. That being said this is a very tolerable album and is not trash and while the other album was not great, not a single song on this album matches ""Your Eyes Open"" from their last. ""Is It Any Wonder?"" is a little edgy but it feels extremely commercial as it gets old after several listens.Overall - 5/10 If you liked their last album this is more of the same and should suffice."
2,So So CD,"Without question, this CD is not even close to Hopes and Fears in terms of quality. There are a few good songs on this disk. Crystal Ball is amazing, but this failed to live up to my expectations. Their first CD is much better."
2,"one great song, lots of filler","I really enjoyed ""Is it any Wonder"". The rest of the songs don't really constitute an album."
5,Darker Keane,"I bought this AFTER I bought their newest album, Strangeland. Compared to that one, Under sounds so dark and somber! But I still really like it. Faves are A Bad Dream, Hamburg Song (love that one) and Try Again. I don't listen to this one as much as Strangeland or Hopes and Fears, but it is still a good one now and then."
4,Great album.,"This is an awesome album, if a bit front-loaded. The unique songwriting and arrangement style is never boring, and the lyrics are enchanting and extremely well written. 4.5/5"
4,Different is good,"""Under The Iron Sea"" is radically different from Keane's previous cd ""Hopes and Fears"" and the difference is wonderful. The album serves up some funky techno sounds and catchy hooks, heavy on synthesizers and great lyrics. Tom Chaplin has improved his breathing control, and although still audible, he no longer sounds heavily congested. Some of the musical arrangements appear to be written specifically to cover his breathing. Whatever they're doing, it works. Several outstanding tracks grace this cd. ""The Hamburg Song"" is a wonderful ballad that reminds the listener of the previous album. ""Broken Toy"" is very good as well as ""Atlantic"" ""Crystal Ball"" (which plays first in reverse then correctly) and ""Is It Any Wonder?"" Forget all the comparisons to Bono and U2. Keane isn't just a U2 knock off band. They deserve credit for their own work."
3,Did Not Knock My Socks Off,"Having been mezmerized by Hopes and Fears with its sweeping falsettos and strong hooks I must say this CD is a bit of a let down. To be sure I did wait until I had listened to album many times before I sat down to do this review. I also find it funny that the song I like the best is the one most reviewers here dismiss as moody and overly melancholy - ""Hamburg Song"". I most certainly would not have put ""Atlantic"" as the first song. The track ""Put It Behind You"" is a strong song that invokes the same sort of feelings the debut album did.All in all this album is very well done, it sounds very good at any volume but the songwriting is not as strong as Hopes and Fears. I remember the last 2 debuts that did knock my sock off and the followup albums seriously sucked - neither band ever recovered in my eyes - you might remember Hootie and The Blowfish and the Crash Test Dummies... I am confident Keane will not follow in those footsteps."
3,Hard to beat Hopes and Fears,"""Is it any Wonder"" was the best song on the CD. All the songs are a bit drawn out and I love Keane but the Hopes and Fears CD was far better, not saying this one is horrible but I was hoping for the same,, I love every song on the CD feeling, I had with the other. Better luck on the next one Keane."
5,Flawless!,"From beginning to end, this album is wonderful. I was a little worried about a case of sophomore slump after hearing ""Is It Any Wonder?"", but I was wrong.Keane takes things in a new direction, yet they chose to keep the heart and insightful qualities of Hopes and Fears, too. There's just the right amount of melancholy, and just the right amount of fun.I wouldn't say there's a filler song on this album. Sure, some songs may take a couple listens to fully appreciate, but all in all, these songs are unforgettable and you'll be listening to this album for days."
4,A worthy Follow Up Effort...,"Did Keane succumb to the sophomore slump? Certainly not. Did they write a masterpiece? Not quite. Instead what we find is a darker side of Keane seen only briefly on their debut album. ""Under the Iron Sea"" offers up memorable Keane piano riffs slowed down processed through analogue synths and guitar effects pedals, with ambient sounds added in the background. Look somewhere else if you are expecting a remake of upbeat piano pop similar to ""Hopes and Fears"" (excluding a few tracks). Tracks such as ""Try Again"", ""Crystal Ball"", and ""A Bad Dream"" seem to soar further with Tom Chaplin's vocals this time around, and the album has an edgier sound. A little less accessible than it predecessor, this album's darker more atmospheric quality might cause casual fans of the more upbeat Keane to turn away, but the true fans will understand.Other stand out tracks include ""Nothing in My Way"", ""Is it any Wonder?"", and ""Leaving So Soon?""."
3,Good but inferior to Hopes & Fears,"My thoughts after 2 listenings: Keane's ""Hopes and Fears"" was amazing with about 6-7 ""Wow"" songs. I had that reaction only after hearing ""Crystal Ball"" from this CD. I would give this CD 3 1/2 stars if I could. All the songs are good and none are clunkers, but it's certainly not amazing like H&F. Those reviewers who put their carefully-crafted 5-star reviews on this website 5 minutes after the CD's release must be related to the band members. Pay what you must for ""Hopes and Fears""."
3,An Easy Listen,"Hopes & Fears was a magical album. The songs were surprising. For example, We Might As Well Be Strangers slowly builds to a climax and then ends all too soon making you want to hear it again and again. There is nothing as dramatic on Under The Iron Sea. This album is more predictable.The instrumentation is not as interesting either. The bright piano sound of their debut is less prominent. Synthesizer swashes, muted piano and mock guitar bathe each song in glossy sheen. Coldplay mined similar territory on the forgettable X&Y.;Without a signature sound Keane are somewhat derivative. Atlantic sounds alot like Radiohead. Nothing In My Way could be Maroon 5. Crystal Ball and A Bad Dream might as well be Robbie Williams.Under The Iron Sea is an easy listen and is recommended to anyone interested in the groups mentioned. I look forward to future releases from this potentially great group.[DW]"
5,Talent at it's best,"I'm not a musician but as an old groover just past 50 I really love the words and great vocal on this extrodinary album. Yes they still make 'em like they used to, you just have to have patient! The one problem I have is how it is packaged. Am I that out of the loop that a band does not have to include in the multiple panels on the liner notes one single photo of the folks who are in the band? What is the mystery? Kind of like to SEE who the people are making the music. Also I realize CDs do not have the great expase that 12x 12 albums had, but can we at least have one paragraph about the band, where they are from, etc. Kripe the names of the guys in the band are 7point grey type in a light weight typeface at the bottom next to the copyright date. What the--?Good/great music should have decently designed liner notes! One thing to be understated and another to beobscure. Keep up the great music guys!!!"
5,Outstanding Musicians,"As a person who LOVED Hopes and Fears, I didn't think they could do any better. I'm extremely pleased to say that I was wrong. This is the best album I've heard in years. It is complete from the first song to the last. I just love the fact that it's so different from what is out there (I don't own any coldplay or U2 albums so I can't say if they're similar). The lowest rating I would give any song is 8.5/10. Almost every song gets a 10/10. This album gives me goosebumps it's so good."
3,Not as catchy as Hopes and Fears,"If you are reading this, you are either a fan of the band or you have heard some buzz about them.Bottom line if you are new to Keane start your collection with Hopes and Fears which is far catchier than this, their follow up.Hopes and Fears was largely a fun album, with an interesting guitar-less sound.This CD is far more experimental and I am convinced in some songs, they are going for a guitar-like sound via keyboard or synths. The CD has its moments such as the lead single ""Is it any Wonder"" and its obvious homage to U2 (I think its sounds like Even Better Than the Real Thing). ""Crystal Ball"" will probably be the next single as it is easily the most catchy track on the CD. However, much of the rest of the CD seems depressing and overly moody. In particular, ""Hamburg Song"" is overly somber.I just do not understand the direction they took with this material. It is a well produced CD but it will probably not rope in many new fans."
5,love love love this CD,"I don't know what I like better; Frog Prince or a Broken toy. Hamgourg song, nothing in my way are awesome as wellGREAT CD, if you are a Keane fan, or just looking for a gret CD with amazing voice, music and lyrics... Keane is it.Also, they sound exactly the same live."
2,Biased reporting.,"This book, like most written and portraying Hurricane Katrina, leads the reader to the conclusion that New Orleans is the only area devastated thereby. For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again. If you want to read and look at a balanced book coverning Hurricane Katrina, this isn't it."
3,infaltable carnival cruise ship,"My son wanted this toy to replace the one we bought on our recent cruise. Since this was half the price we paid for the one on board ship, I purchased it here."
5,Fun and Safe for children's bath,We've been using Tub Tints for years. They are non-toxic color pellets that disolve in the bath water without staining your child's skin or toys. My son has a blast mixing the colors and making soap potions. You won't find a better bath toy for your child's tub experience.
3,Item description not accurate,Says that there is 200 in each container- no there is not! Only 30 per container. Its a fun item for the kids but just know the description is not correct on how many you get
5,Tub Tints for Tub Fun,These are fun for children and teaches them colors. Makes their bath an enjoyable time. Some children really don't like bath time and this peaks their interest. I am a grandmother and my daughter-in-law has used these for about 3 years now. Her second child has just turned 1 so she is teaching him colors and this is one way to help.
2,Limited fun,These tablets are good because they disinigrate very well in tub water and the colors are vibrant. However the color of the tablets before they go into water is different than the color they actually are in water which makes it very confusing for both myself and my daughter. It makes it very hard for me to teach her about mixing colors (like yellow +blue=green) if we don't know what colors we are starting out with.
5,loving tub time,my son went through a phase where he didnt want to go in the tub even though he had a ton of toys and things to do in the tub. his aunt bought him tub tints and he gets to pick one or two out of the jar and he throws them in he loves it. he even says the color as he is picking it out. i just wish they had jars with one color because he loves to use blue or make green or purple and there isent enough blue tablets. well he loves going into the tub now.
3,pretty nice pot,"It is a very good looking pot. I love the look of it sitting on my stove. Unfortunately it is just too big for us as I am usually cooking for only 2 people. It would not be so bad if the insert went all the way down, but it does not. By a long way. So you end up having to put much more water than you need if you are cooking a small quantity. Otherwise it is a nice pot though."
2,Angry Red Planet: Reaction at the original premier,"Way back when, when exploitation flicks were really in full bloom, came ""The Angry Red Planet"" which was purported at the time to be filmed in a new film process, which turned out to be a red wash to make the cheap scenery and astoundingly dumb visual effects look like Mars.For the record, the film actually had a World Premiere at LA's former 4-Star Theatre, once located in the Miracle Mile District.I was just a kid and the screening was not filled, although the stars of the film, namely Nora Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen (who went on to be a major character actor) attended - so theatre mangement let me in to take a look. Without giving away too much, many shots were apparantly lifted from an old 3 Stooges short, the film reeked of cheapness, the music score wasappropriately schlocky, and it was a cheap shot from beginning to end, however, it was fun and worth seeing once..just to see the real low end of the genre.Worth seeing anyway."
4,If you want...........,"........some pure Science fiction campy/humor, give this one a try. You will definitely giggle alot at the ""goofy"" martians and the special film technique. This is a never-fail fun movie for the entire family!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,50's scifi,"Never saw this as a kid. Good romp, unfortunately, so dated. Watch it for fun. Brings back childhood memories.Enjoy."
3,A good B movie,"If you like the B movies of the 50's this one is a fun watch. Its pretty well acted the the special FX are pretty good for the time. I didnt quite like the ""Cinemagic"" used to make the Red Planet red but im sure it was pretty cool for its time. Dont pick this one apart (cause it will come apart quite easily) just sit back and enjoy some cool cheese of the 50's. My review is for the DVD version."
3,"Curiously overrated, but still fun","Hey, I'm all about some nifty 50's and 60's cheesy sci-fi flicks. Heck, I LOVE 'EM! But I have to say I think ANGRY RED PLANET is a bit overrated. I never saw ""Cinemagic"" displayed on the Big Screen, but it's fairly headache-inducing on my 27-inch t.v.The plot has one decent gimmick, the framing device of using flashbacks (used to better effect in IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE) to tell the story. But really, the acting is atrocious, even for a B-grade sci-fi/monster flick.On the plus side, the ""batratspidercrab"" thing is one of the more memorable beasties, strings and all. And the sets, though obviously painted backgrounds, are imaginative and just plain weird.Picture and sound quality are what we've come to expect from MGM's Midnite Movies line: superb. So if this kind of film is your thing, you could do worse than ANGRY RED PLANET. But. . .you could also do a lot better."
3,Lounge Lizard Goes To Mars,"Yes it's true, Gerald Mohr(with slicked back hair and jumpsuit zipper pulled down to show his manly chest hair) looks and sounds like a Vegas lounge act that got booked for a trip to Mars. Using a red filter that makes everything look like a Pepto-bismol bottle that broke, this silly but fun blast from the past is an alright time killer.The plot, a ship sent to Mars crashes upon it's return and one of the survivors has to explain what happened. As this is done we flash back and see everything unfold. Space Bats(or at least that is what they look like ) and other creatures await our group.Like I said nothing Earth shattering, but campy fun to be had if you can get into it."
2,Filmed over the weekend on some leftover sets?,"Watch the first seven or eight minutes of this movie carefully, and you'll see something interesting: only ONE scene (an exchange between a few characters in an ""aerospace"" office) was actually filmed for this movie, and the rest is all stock footage-- of aircraft, naval bases, radar equipment, etc. In other words, it's another quality production of American International Pictures! And that opening segment is only the beginning. Wait'll you see some of the more ambitious cost-saving measures later on. And I guess that's my point: if you go into this movie as a kind of ""student of schlock"", you might have some fun with it. But if you are looking for something truly involving or actually thought-provoking, take the advice of the (badly hand drawn) martian in the movie and ""keep away and never return!"""
1,you have to be terribly bored to want to buy this,"Many things don't make sense in this movie. E.g.:there is gravity in space ship in space""the air is so thin on mars to conduct sound"", said one of the crew, yet they brought along a ""sonic gun"" as a principle weaponone guy kept waving a pistol in the face of his fellow crew mates, but never aimed or fired it at the creaturespeople who were infected were not quarantinedall the crew went outside together and no one is left to man the spaceshipthe captain(? guy who waves the pistol around) said ""let's stay close to each other"" but yet a minute earlier they were shooting the breeze while a female crew were left alone to collect samples from moving plantsI guess it's ok to watch if you don't try to make sense of it."
1,god-Awful!,"This is undoubtedly one of the worst science-fiction films I've ever seen. The red hue and wierd ""music"" was boring and well..I've already taped over it-which is about as good of a use as I can recommend for this waste of tape."
5,It sure is red,"Awful acting and silly monsters make this film a fun watch. Those that gave it anything less than a 5 stars aren't playing fair. It's a bad movie for certain, but it's still a great example of the sci-fi flicks that were being spit out of Hollywood in the '50s. So just sit back, pop yourself a beer, and enjoy the spectacle of angry Martian monsters chasing the actors around through red filtered scene after red filtered scene."
3,Getchyaasstomarsgetchyaasstomarsgetchyaasstomars,"Mars is a lousy vacation spot when it's in a good mood(just ask Arnold Schwarzenegger), but when it's pissed, it's downright mean.When a rocket is retrieved from a troubled Mars expedition, it's only coherent survivor(Naura Hayden) tells a tale of how upon landing, the crew is menaced by man(and woman)eating plants, a giant amoeba, a triclops, and that spider-bat monster from the Misfits' Walk Among Us album cover. Basically it's a subtle hint to Earth to leave Mars the hell alone!Fairly typical 50s sci-fi silliness, so you know what your pretty much in for. The irritating thing about this film is the annoying red filter used for the scenes taking place on Mars' surface. I know this supposed to be snazzy looking, but....it's not! I think it was probably also used to mask the fakeness of the creatures to some degree, but fake is fake. Besides, we goofballs who like this stuff love the fake creatures!Only fans of(bad) 50's sci-fi need apply."
5,Good product,After 2 yrs this product is still working and I have had no problem with it. I hope this helps you
5,Great product,Was exactly what i wanted. Easy to install. Have replaced all the others in my home. Definet cost savings in my heating bill.
5,honey well thermostat,"The product was received ahed of its scheduled date. it works very well, and I would rcommend it for any one needing a thermostat"
2,"Cannot handle cooling applications, made in China","For some strange reason this device cannot handle cooling applications, only heating.Because of this design shortfall this thermostat cannot handle air conditioners or fan type cooling.Made in Communist China."
5,One of the best Pork cuts.,"Baby Mammoth remains one of the yet undiscovered wonders of the acclaimed Pork Records (together with Fila Brazillia and Bullitnuts). Classified as lounge music, electronica or electrofunk, theses bands have long ago discarded any of these sordid labels, creating something fresh and undescribable upon each release. Active for many years and records, Baby Mammoth's latest release is ""Motion Without Pain"", and it shows they have done their homework. Opening with the Moby-esque ""Elephunk"", the album is a complete delight, combining different styles that match perfectly, like the funeral like trumpet and the up beats in ""Tasty Maloney"", or the overused sample from ""Aquarela do Brasil"" in the wonderful ""The Ghost of Henry"". ""Ebb & Flow"" begins with a menacing speech about the human nature, only to dissolve into a charming bass-based tune. Enjoy without pain."
4,"Fun, Fun","Beautiful colour, just what you need if you need cheering, a teen movie that adults will enjoy, lovely singing, comedy, I was glad to add it to my classics collection."
5,Jane!! Two Iturbis!! Cugat!!,"The problem with the story is way too much of Pidgeon and Massey. They are quite dull, and Massey's irritating vibrato ruins every song. She also ruins Balalaika, otherwise a very good musical.The story is cute as you would expect with Jane running diplomat dad's household. She manages with her charm a great coup, to get both Iturbi and Cugat to entertain at a party she's planned for Dad. Well, with Iturbi, it was really her singing Fille Du Cadiz that persuaded him. All the time she's trying to keep lovesick Roddy from getting to serious. She doesn't sing as much as I would like. Her Italian Street Song is wonderful, rivaling others I've heard, and I've heard a lot of them.Its lots of enjoyable nonsense with very fine music."
5,gorillla poster,"shipped fast, just as shown! make sure you unwrap it the right way or it will rip like it did on me!"
5,Sweet poster,I'm so excited to put this poster up in my dorm room. Posterrevolution always does a great job pairing with amazon to give the best prices and the fastest S&H. This poster elsewhere on line was $14.99 for just the poster! The colors are vibrant and it isn't pixelated. I'll be shopping here again and again!
2,Loved the picture but not the material,This poster was not overall worth it. I loved the picture but not so much the material of the poster.
3,What the?,"I received the package on time, but the packaging was damaged. The poster has a bunch of scratches and crimps on it. If it didn't only cost $2, I might send it back for a replacement."
5,The best!,My wonderful partner gave this book to me as a Christmas gift in 1993. I have probably read the book at least 5 or 6 times since then. I enjoyed Maupin's The Tales of the City series except the last two books which were dissapointing. I hated The Night Listener.I think that maybe the Moon is Maupin's best work. It's funny and very sad and moving at the same time. It's hard not to fall in love with the character of Cady.
4,Maybe the Moon review,Maybe the Moon: A NovelIt was a good read; but i like the Tales in the City books better.I am glad I read it though and must admit I sympathized with the main character. It is well written and I do recommend it.
4,Haunting,"I read Cadence's story with much discomfort. I felt sorry for her (though Cadence didn't at all feel sorry for herself) and wanted to be finished with the book though I didn't want to stop reading. The end absolutely stunned me. I just didn't see it coming and I was saddened and outraged and couldn't get Cadence off my mind for a few days.Cadence is probably the most unforgettable character I have ever met in my reading.I listened to Maupin's Tales of the City books on tape and though I enjoyed listening to them more than I enjoyed reading Maybe the Moon, the latter book, without a doubt, made a huge impact on me."
2,Not Maupin's best work,I did not care for this work about the drarf although I imagine she like so many people who are different had a very difficult time in life the suibject matter was not my cup of tea as to reading material. It's a well written piece of work if you're into dwarfs' life stories.
1,Poorly constructed canopy,"We've never gotten to use the canopy yet because the clips are of such poor quality & construction, they broke the first time they were squeezed to open & attach to the wagon!!This needs serious thought & better quality."
3,"I WISH that I could give it five stars, I really do!!!","LOVED this canopy when I first bought it. Then it broke. One of the clamps broke off and now we have an industrial-grade clamp on one. Sigh. If Radio Flyer wants other people to look at our ""cool"" ride and see one of the clamps broken off, that's too bad, because another parent might be considering buying one of these costly items only to realize how poorly made it is and change their mind.It's very sad to see how disposeable products are these days...one used to be able to get something that would last a lifetime, and probably two or three generations. Maybe that's why I keep going back to buying things of the past and refurbishing them (upcycling)...I seem to get a lot more bang for my buck that way.Anyhow, after that rant, I'm going to probably end up futzing with this to improve it in a way that will work for us. And I might just take the Radio Flyer name off of it and put my OWN LABEL on it (with ""Made in the USA on it) this time :-)"
3,A pain to set up,This works wonderfully but it is a HUGE pain to put up and take down every time. I don't use the wagon very much bc I think protecting from the sun is a must. I thought this was a great solution and once its up its great but it doesn't fit in the bag very well. Overall it works just don't think this will be a quick easy thing every time.
3,Handle with extreme caution - highly breakable.,"Cheap canopy addition to an otherwise cool wagon. Don't break the clamps, or you'll be replacing the entire thing. Not worth thirty bucks at all."
3,Somewhat awkward to attach,"This is a sharp loooking canopy but is somewhat unwieldy and awkward to attach to the wagon. No matter how carefully you attach it it slips and slides, It is an okay item, not a great one."
3,"finally got it put up, but doesn't seem sturdy!",The directions were not good at all just pictures...and the middle bar doesn't stay inside too well...it was really by luck we got it to stay...so far it has been fine but it should be more sturdy for the price!
3,"Love the idea. Not much shade, and clamp snapped off","This is really great idea. However, as soon as we installed it, a cross bar snapped in half. Then a couple of weeks later one of the clamps snapped off. We are trying to find replacement parts with no luck so far.The canopy doesn't provide shade unless the sun is directly above. Radio Flyer could have used a wider design that curved over to provide shad as sun rises and sets. Would not purchase again."
4,Radio Flyer Wagon Canopy is a must have,"I found this canopy easy to install and it is adequate protection from the sun. I agree with other reviews that it could be challenging to get the canopy back in the bag. However, I have not tried to put it away. I do plan on keeping the canopy on the wagon at all times."
4,Good buy,"The canopy does its job. It's great looking, cute and keeps the sun out. It's tall enough to not interfer with getting in the wagon or taking things out, including the kids. One note, it fits all different brands of wagons so don't be fooled in to buying the expensive Radio Flyer wagon. Our wagon is from Lowes and cost $49, it's got the big wheels and fold down sides and is very heavy duty. There are other brands on Amazon too. Buy smart. I do recommend the canopy."
2,canopy rips easily!,"Be careful...this ripped after about 2 months. I'm not even sure how it ripped. My kids are not particularly rough on toys and this does provide shade, but is FRAGILE for the price."
2,Great idea but poor quality,"Unfortunately, we're on our third one since we purchased the first one 18 months ago. The clamps are very fragile and will literally come apart in your hands without even a discernible ""snap"" after about 6 months. The nylon fabric itself is easily worn through if you accidentally rub the canopy on say, a fence, as you are passing. We have always stored our wagon with the canopy set up in our garden shed or inside under our stairs, so it's not that it's been left outside in the elements apart from when we are using it, nor have the clamps been repeatedly opened and closed.However, it fits the wagon perfectly , is collapsible (if that matters to you) and provides excellent shelter in all the weather we have encountered during our daily walks to school in England. So we have reluctantly ordered another one. I just wish it was as durable as the wagon it is designed for. :-("
5,A Shady Deal!,"We love our outings in Florida, and this canopy has saved us a lot of worries about sunburn! I would say that this is a ""must"" for your toddler. It was a little confusing at first to set-up and take down, but it probably would have been easier if I had read the directions first. Now, after a couple of weeks, it is second nature. It sets firmly onto the wagon, and when broken down, transports easily."
3,Made in China,"Well, the wagon seems OK once you get past the initial return of the thing and finally a second shipping with no broken parts arrives, but the tires do smell to high heaven as other reviews have mentioned!!!! If you're familiar with coal tar, then you know exactly how this thing smells. My first package arrived in perfect condition (outer shipping box and inner wagon box) only to find a wooden side rail broken when the box was opened. The part was so cleanly broken that the person who did the shipping had to have just tossed the piece in with the rest instead of correcting the problem. I suppose when you get paid 10 cents a day you could care less about what goes in the box. I would rather pay more, get better quality, and keep the jobs here in the USA. I am now waiting to see how long the wood side rails will last, they seem to be made of pretty light weight wood. I've already made templates of the rails to make my own once the grandkids destroy the sides under normal play conditions."
2,"Love the shade, but the clamps break","Such a shame - like other reviewers on here, our kids loved the canopy, but after about a dozen outings, one of the clamps split. We have tried to attach the canopy in other ways, but it's too clumsy. The weak spots on the clamps are easy to see - it's surprising that Radio Flyer hasn't recognised their failings and improved them.I'd love to recommend this canopy but unfortunately the flimsy clamps prevent me from doing so."
5,Great Coverage,"I would not review this canopy as a toy. It is functional object for a wagon and does offer great sun protection at certain parts of the day, noon being the best obvioulsy. It has clamps which makes it easy to remove and install frequently. Overall, I would recommend this product as a great addition to a wagon."
4,Great item but fragile clamps!,"We bought this canopy a year ago as an addition to our girls' wagon. No regrets on buying it as it seems to do its job/purpose...wish it was a little bit cheaper. Haven't had any problems with it until recently when one of the clamps cracked in half for no apparent reason...rendered it useless. Luckily, the clamps are replaceable! The downside is that the clamp is roughly $[...] + shipping. I got on the company's website and was going to purchase 2 clamps (one as a backup) + tax and $[...] shipping totaling to almost $27. A little outrageous if you ask me.To make the long story short, I just bought a new canopy for $[...] and free shipping. At least I'll have 3 backup clamps and an extra canopy should the other one tear."
1,Still baking,"I don't recommend this wagon canopy, however, I don't think thier are too many alternatives. It looks nice and seems to be made of good materieals. The design is lacking. We have it on the All Terrain Cargo Wagon , and when attached to the sides, the canopy is so high that the wagon riders are rarely in the shade. Also, I dont have a lot of faith in the clamps used to attach the canopy to the wagon. The fiberglass frame of the canopy puts so much pressure on the clamps that they don't close completly on the wagon sides, and it pushes the sides outward enough that it will eventually lead to a break somewhere."
4,Wagon Canopy,"This canopy is a cute addition for the wagon, but I agree with the other comments the frame is fragile. I think if the children applied very much pressure to the frame it will break, also our grandchildren were intrigued by the clamps that hold the canopy on the wagon and wanted to play with them. When you begin to play with the clamps, it loosens canopy's hold on the wagon and allows it to flap in the wind.The canopy works well and adds a very unique look for the wagon. If you are looking for a cute addition, this is IT!"
3,Not impressed,I was excited about this when I purchased it but it just clamps on to the side of the wagon and the clamps can pop off easily. It also dents the side of the wagon when you clamp it on.
2,cheap,"hoped for something decent to last a while, expected alot better quality from radio flyer, cheaply made dont see this canopy lasting long,"
3,Works well but very fragile,"These canopies seem to last about six months for us. On the first one the struts in the middle broke. This last one one of the clamps broke, making it useless. I'm going to keep the broken one as parts for the next one when it breaks."
3,"Odd,","because this book leaves me feeling that he felt his life was unreal and his fiction was real.He lived in boredom punctuated by terror--manic/depressive, opium smoking, Russian roulette playing, suicidal.Was he a spy, even after he left the Foreign Office? Was writing his cover for travel? Does boredom fully explain his uncanny knack for being in troubled places in troubled times?No matter. He was a great stylist and craftsman. This autobiography (along with ""A Sort of Life"") is worth reading for his methods as a novelist and for portraits of friends, such as Waugh and Herbert Reed."
3,Meandering but interesting,"I'd have to agree with another reviewer who characterized this as ""odd."" Greene was apparently writing this in his 70s, and the prose isn't always as pellucid as one would wish. His writing career spanned roughly 1930 to 1980, and in spite of my cavil on the datedness of his style he is unarguably a major 20th century literary figure. (Apparently there's a huge 3-volume biography on him available.)The essays really meander between the struggles he underwent in writing, his travels, his impressions of the political problems on the ground in Malaysia, Haiti, Vietnam and Cube between WWII and the 1970s.It's full of juicy anecdotes, including his mixed experiences with Hollywood trying to bring some of his work to film. If you've enjoyed some of his novels (which, sadly, are dated as to style now, inevitably), you should pick this up from the library or a used book store and get some background on Greene's demons and motivations..."
1,Fine product - Bad seller,"This is my first review, even though I been buying through amazon for years. When I purchased this product I thought It would be a brand new product. For my surprise, it has a tag where it says ""Tester, not for resale""."
5,Lives up to the claim,"This toner hydrates my freshly cleansed face. The scent is very soothing as well. Never does it irritate or cause my skin to break out. I would say I have fickle skin. Sometimes, I'll spritz this over my makeup. You need just the basics for great skin. Nothing fancy or pricey. This bottle goes a long way and its benefits are worth the price."
4,"JVC LT40FH97 40"" 1080p Flat Panel LCD HDTV","The TV works great in all aspects except one. There is a fiberoptic audio output port which works fine when the TV is in ""digital"" mode. It does not operate in analog which causes me some grief as I have it hooked to my sound system and I have to use the TV speakers when in analog. Some of that is probably due to the fact that I am tryng to get a TIVO the TV and my AV receiver DVD player and VCR to all ""play nice"" together. I think if I were to subscribe to an HDTV service I could get around that problem. As it is I can receive a good many digital channels on Comcast at my present level of service (non digital). My only other gripe is the treatment the unit got in shipping. Came via Roadway Freight and I very nearly turned it down because of external damage to the carton. I took a big chance and accepted delivery but I sure hope they find another shipper as the roadway deliverey man handled it like a sack of spuds."
4,Cover leaves much to be desired,"This isn't a shabby cover piece, but the 70s paperbacks were a lot more original. On this book we really aren't given much to work with, just a very simple painting with very simple, non-detailed artwork. The gentlemen in the cover is either Fallon, or it depicts a stranger in the town of Fallon. I can't be sure because I didn't read the book. But based on the cover art, I probably don't want to."
5,have read enought LAmour to know this is a good one,"its almost a short story, but it satisfies. enjoyed the brief escape in to the old west on this one, recognized some of the story element from other books. I believe this would be a great book for someone that isn't a frequent reader but wants a nice escape. So many times I give books away to folks that wouldn't necessarily go out and buy a book. this is the kind of non-intimidating size that attracts a new reader."
5,Louis L'Amour Books,It is very easy to write a review about Louis L'Amour books. He was very fortunate to have lived and traveled the world as he did. When he wrote his books much research was done on the subject and places that he wrote about. I have read every one of Louis L'Amour's books and now after a few years its time to re-read them all. You could not read any other books that will hold your attention as these do. Read them all.
3,Disappointed,"I LOVE Dylan and love this song...I was so excited to see that it had been made into a children's book! (I'm a 1st grade teacher) While the illustrations are beautiful, it's not even close to what I visualized during the thousands of times I sang the song. It might be perfect for a less ""diehard"" Dylan fan."
4,Bold and masterful,"A bold, masterful and colorful representation of of the song. Kiddos will love guessing each animal as it is revealed and will find them just as appealing as will their parents. Jim Arnosky provides a plethora of wildlife and plants in all varieties coexisting from around the world crafting a striking visual of God's abundant creation. See if you can find all the animals listed! -Biblio Reads Children's Book Review"
5,Dylan names a few animals,"This book is wonderfully illustrated. It's Dylan, so you can't go wrong. Song is not one that casual Dylan fans would know, but it comes with a cd of the tune too."
5,PRACTICAL CATS--NOW AND FOREVER!,"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release that features a private investigator who is also a poet, I love this book. This verse collection is perhaps T.S. Eliot's most accessible work, and it provided the raw material for the fabulous musical CATS. I enjoy reading these poems, and I've enjoyed attending the musical. I think I saw CATS three times during its Winter Garden run, twice in Los Angeles, and once each in San Francisco and the Palm Springs area. CATS would not exist as a most enjoyable musical if the poet Eliot had not first jotted down OLD POSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATS."
5,Loved it!!,This book is a fantastic vehicle through which to teach sixth graders the properties of poetry. I've been doing it for many years now and it has always been a big hit. I've added the CD to accompany the print and this year I'm adding the video. Try it. It works.
3,Old Possum's Book of Practical cats,I had hoped for a more extensive selection of these poems. I was wanting to use it to show a gradnchild how the musical was adapted from the poems.
5,CATS!,"Love it Must have Huge Anderw Lloyd Webber fan Love tsElliot Perfect for cat lovers I have a Sunflower glamour cat about 16-18 years old I have Ginger and Cow-cat too""In my next life I wish to be a cat!""In memory of DEMjr"
4,"The musical is amazing , but the book is much better","I love T.S. Eliot's work. Eventhough this is written for children, there are still elements in the story that pertains to adults. The lyrical form just flows like water and even if you are not a cat lover, this book will make you think differently."
2,Disappointed,"I thought it would be ""cute"". I have never seen ""Cats"" play/movie but several people said it was great and I liked the pictures and look inside. The illustrations were... off somehow. Save for one, I was not impressed. I gave it away in the Christmas batch of books, thinking maybe the kids would make short work of it. In my opinion, it's incomprehensible to children and a weird point of view to think about cats having such... attitude. I did enjoy a few of the poems, but it will likely end up giving it to our local library when the kids get tired of it."
3,Get the Movie first,The poems were a bit hard for me to read. However after watching the movie (play) and listening to the sound track it was much easier to read.
1,The book that never arrived,"This book never arrived and has of yet still hasn't arrived, which does not speak well of the service provided by the seller (was it Amazon...I think so) and I will be looking into where it might be or what happened to it. thanks for asking me to review as I had forgotten that we purchased this...maybe we'll get it now!Maek me down as a less than please customer."
2,what was he thinking,"I'm not quite sure what Eliot was thinking when he wrote this particular set of verse, and coming from such a 'serious' poet as he was. I suppose that regardless of the quality of the poetry, it is still important to read because Eliot himself is important in the canon. But I have to wonder. It gets rather sing songy at times and there doesn't seem to be much technical mastery to the poem. And I hated the subject matter."
5,CATS DVD,"We saw the show recently at a community theater. It was wonderful. My 7-yr. old grandaughter loved it, so we decided to buy the DVD and the original book. Excellent!"
5,Cute and Funny,"This book always cracks me up. T.S. Eliot's cats are so much like cats (both fatcats and felines) I have encountered over the years that no matter which poem I read I can relate it to a real cat. It's just so charming. I recommend this to anyone. If you like cats, poetry, TS ELiot, or Webber's Cats you'll love this book."
5,A Joy for All Ages,"What a great book!! I gave this to my 22 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves books. I read to her as a child, and decided to start collecting great children's books for her that she does not have from her childhood. This is the first one I bought for the collection. She was THRILLED! The pictures in this version are really beautiful."
4,Old Possum's Book of Cats,"If you have not read this before you attend the theater to see ""Cats"" you will not get it!"
4,I loved this book!,"All of the poems are well-written and easy to understand.This is a good book for anyone who loves poetry!Thisbook is great,but unfortunatly,the illustrations are notvery good-it seems like the illustrator rushed throughthe illustrations in this book.Aside from that one fault,Irecommend this book for any CATs or poetry fan!"
5,Werry Gut Serve und Pervect,I got quick delivery and good quality from this Seller.Very satisfied would buy again.
3,Defective Disc,I have attempted to purchase this album twice. Both times I have received a defective Disc which does not play appropriately but instead produces a very disturbing distorted electronic sound with each track. Can I really have such bad luck? Or is the entire batch of discs for the reissue of this album compromised? I would like to hear it but I give up now.
2,I Don't Get It; I Don't Like It,"I'm sorry, but this is one Zane Grey book I do not like. I have only managed to read the entire thing just one time. It's boring; it's flat; it's unbelievable. Stephen Latch, the main character, is not some one you can have any sympathy for, or at least be able to think, well, maybe, perhaps; or even have any mercy for. I'm not some one to criticize an author for what he writes because I know he has something he wants to say, or an opinion; but I just don't understand what Zane Grey was doing with this book. My advice is skip it, and pick a better one and then come back to this one. I know not every book an author creates is perfect, or great; Zane Grey just missed this time out."
4,Cozy.,Better than the one I was issued in 1969. Snug fit and warm on an 6 hour outing on a 2 degree day.
3,Very Warm Hat,"This is a great hat. The wool is a bit itchy as expected and it runs a little large, but it's very warm. A great deal."
1,Genuine U.S.Navy Wool Watch Cap,"The photo shows a hat with thick yarn,with a chunky, sturdy look to it.The actual item was knitted with thin yarn and when held up to put on, you could see daylight between all the stitches.It would not keep any U.S. Navy person warm for long.Service:Hat $6.95Shipping and handling$6.30Return shipping by me (first class) $1.51Return fee: 15%I consider this gouging to a point of dishonesty. It only cost me $1.50 to mail it back; that's a bit much for 'handling'. The returns policy, slicing off another 15%, was not displayed in full on the ordering page.I am disappointed in the product and DISGUSTED with the service."
1,not as described,"Purchased this item for my uncle, it is described as 100% wool and as a genuine navy watch cap, the item received was small and clearly not wool, others have described as a cheap knock off, so buyer beware. Sold by: Captain Dave Inc. SHAME ON YOU. It's not worth the price of return."
3,US Navy Wool Watch Cap,"The ""One size fits all"" does not work well at all. This cap was way too small for me, and not long enough. I gave it to my son. They should make these in med., large, and x-large sizes."
2,Too tight and small and no return on hats,"First of all, the label says this cap is made to DOD specifications, which any manufacturer can say. It is NOT U.S. Navy issue. More importantly, I found it to be too small and tight. This hat would not fit any jarhead I ever met! ""For sanitary reasons,"" the seller does NOT accept returns on hats. And even if they did, their shipping policies on returns would make it more expensive than the hat itself. So unless you have a tiny head, don't order this hat because once you get it, you're stuck with it!"
1,DO NOT MACHINE WASH AND DRY THIS!,"The wool watch cap did serve its purpose, and kept my head warm for couple days. Then I start getting the itch on head, so I figured it because the hat is new. I looked over the care instruction, and couldn't find any on the inside label or on the website. Without thinking too much, I put it in the washer and dryer. Now my hat is sooo small that a 1 month baby can't fit in. Worst product I ever got on Amazon!"
1,They post items for sale and do not have them in stock.,"After investing time and effort into finding a pair of cleats he would like, I order them instead of another pair he had chosen only to find out 2 days later that they were out of stock. I wish all vendors would learn to only post what you can actually deliver."
4,one way,Very easy to set up and use. Just follow the directions.However this device is one way communication to printers from computer only - there is no way for a printer to send error reports or status back to the computer. This device is also advertised to handle USB storage devices - if anyone figures that out then please share with the rest of us.
2,Should have read all reviews,This product works well only after you reboot it and everything else befor printing. When trying to print after a few inactive days the first page prints half way and nothing thereafter. Junk in my opinion. Used to like D-Link but I am leaning toward Netgear now.
2,The darnedest thing...,"D.k. whether it's antivirus software or what, but getting this print server to print wirelessly just ain't happening. Have plenty of experience (read: years wasted) on this stuff and on a cuople of occasions have gotten things to work right for one of two wirelessly connected laptops, but then couldn't print from two ethernet-connected-to-wireless-router desktops. Vista Ultimate on desktop reports print server software (device home page) not kosher; Vista Ultimate laptop says it can see, but it cannot print.Guh! Good luck yo any who set forth upon these undefined shores!"
2,"What a pain to conclude, it does not work","Would have been nice if the entire range of printers was noted in a front location at Dlink, but no, you have to go hunting. You think out of 60 some hp printers mine would have made the list, but no, so Im out the money, not allot of cash, but still,it says compatable with hp printers, so take my advice and just buy a printer that has the WIFI or hard wire ready port and save the time and cash. How much is your time worth after spending the hour or two realizing IT DOESNT WORK."
3,"Does the job, but not seamlessly","It does allow me top print from windows and macs computers to both an HP laserwriter and a canon multifunctional machine. But it is a pain in the A** to set up and it is flaky. I have to do reboot and plug or unplug the printers to reset on a regular basis. With Windows computers, I can print documents on the canon, but I have to go plug in via USB if I want to print pictures or graphics. Sometimes I wonder if I just should have sprung for newer printers that have built in wifi."
1,Piece of Junk,"Have had this item for 1 year, 2 months, used it very little (it's a print server for my home network, and we've printed maybe 20 times during that time frame). I've had it on a UPS the entire time, so it had clean power, and I had it in a large room so the temperatures were never excessive. By rights, this device should have lasted several years at least under those conditions, but it's just decided to do the ""flashing green power light"" of death, from which not even a hard reset will recover. Now I have a brick and a sour attitude towards D-Link. I'm not sure why I keep taking chances with hardware from this company - every single item I've bought from them has been a disappointment."
1,Worthless with little recourse,"This item never worked correctly from the time I obtained it. My job is IT so I have a good understanding of networking. After configuring this Print Server, I could never access it wirelessly. I spent almost 3 hours on the phone with their tech support, got a case number, had it escalated 2 levels. Still no solution. When I called back after the weekend to resume the case, I got a entry level tech support guy who wouldn't escalate but was unable to solve the problem (nor communicate effectively in English). So I have a ""wireless"" Print Server that won't work without an Ethernet cable attached to it (thus pretty worthless to me), and a company that apparently won't stand behind it to replace it."
2,"Okay product, terrible instructions, but it DOES work on a Mac*","It took about 10 hours of work to make it function with a MacBook running OS X 10.4.6 and an Epson CX 6400, and I needed a windows XP PC to set it up, but yes it works. For Mac installation, the trick is that (using the windows xp pc connected with wire - not wirelessly) you need to change the static IP of the server to a DHCP given by your router and then you have to go trial an error with your browser to find whatever address it was assigned. On the Mac, set it up as an LPD printer. Also, make sure you type the queue name exactly as it is shown on the status screen and God help you if you don't have one of the printers listed on the packaging."
1,Very Difficult To Install,There was nothing easy about this install nor was the support very helpful. Long story short I returned the product and purchased an Airlink 101. The Airlink installed flawlessly.
1,NOT SATISFIED AT ALL WITH THIS PRODUCT,"WHEN I WRITE THIS REVIEW I DON'T WANT AMAZON IN ANY WAY TO TAKE THIS STATEMENT TO REFLECT ON YOU AT ALL. MY WHOLE PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT IS DIRECTED AT THE D-LINK CORPORATION, I RECEIVED THIS ITEM IN JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER I ORDERED IT. I CALLED D-LINK 3 SEPARATE TIMES OVER A 3 WEEK PERIOD AND 3 TIME I HAD TO DEAL WITH A PERSON THAT DID NOT SPEAK HARDLY ANY ENGLISH. IN 3 TRIES I COULD NOT SET THIS DEVICE UP ON MY COMPUTER. THE INSTRUCTION THAT CAME WITH THIS PRODUCT ARE SO VAGUE IT IS RIDICULOUS SO IN 3 TRIES WITH THEIR SO CALLED HELP I WAS NOT ABLE TO SET THIS PRODUCT UP ON MY COMPUTER. SO I SENT IT BACK APRIL 4 2008. NOT AMAZONS FAULT AND I WOULD NOT CHOOSE ANY D-LINK PRODUCTS. GARRY FUGITT MONROE OHIO."
1,D-Link DPR-1260 Wireless Print Server,"I had tried two units, both of which were unsuccessful at even being recognized by my laptop. I never really got to even test my printer compatibilities. My downfall was attempting to configure the print server via D-link's web browser interface. While connected through a LAN connection I could not for the life of me get the server to be recognized. With my first unit I had contacted D-link regarding my problems. After an hour or so on the phone, D-link support came to the conclusion that I was sold a defective product. So off I went to return for an exchange. Got home and attempted to setup just as D-link support had guided me last time. Still no luck. Overall, its a nice looking product, instructions/manuals seem to be a bit disorganized and incomplete, and phone support seemed to not be too concerned with helping me get my system running. Sorry, but this product is really a no go for me."
3,"Good product, easy set up but major set back for MFC's","Set up was a breeze, the web based configurator is great. However, if you want to use this with an MFC you have to stick the list that D-link issues, because IT DOES NOT WORK with every MFC. I had to hook ours back to our router and use it that way through the network, though, it took away one of the major reason why I got this print server.Also, the scanning feature only works through the web set up on an MFC, so this is a major set back.D-link needs to rethink its claim of Multi-function when it is so limited."
1,The Worst Nightmare this Year,"I am a system engineer, and expected this item to be a plug and play solution to my print sharing problem on a mixed network with Apple as well as PC computers, as it says on the box. The fine print indicates that you can download software to accomplish the promises on the box, but alas, the website doesn't actually have the software. After 3 hours on the phone with level 1 tech support that knows less than I do, I decided to return the product. I don't know if my unit was defective new out of the box, or if it's just poorly supported hardware. I don't think it was worth any more time to work on it. After all, they aren't paying me to fix this junk."
2,Didn't work with 2 of 3 HP printers in my home!,"When I read it was tested with more than 100 printers, I assumed it would work with my 3 home printers. After all, they are HP, the most common printers outthere. Not so!Turned out, it worked with my HP Photosmart 8450, but didn't work with my HP Laserjet 1018 nor with HP Laserjet 3330. Disappointing experience."
1,Couldn't Get It to Work,"I got this print server because I had read on the Internet it would work with my Samsung printer. I did never find out, because on my two Windows computers (one XP and the other Vista) I was unable to complete the very first stage of the installation, namely connecting to the print server's configuration page. I sent an e-mail to D-Link's support, but did not get an answer within four days.Thus, the print server was either incompatible with my Windows installations, or the instructions given were so bad that even I, an experienced computer user, could not figure them out (I tried a number of hours). Disappointed, I will have to bring this device back to the store."
2,Problematic,"In general the DPR-1260 server worked as stated. I used it w/ a Canon MP530 and it only worked for printing, not scanning (as I expected since it isn't a supported printer). It failed a few times and twice I needed tech support to help get it back on track. In about a year it failed completely so I recycled it and won't be buying another one."
1,Only if you feel lucky,"I have two HP printers both of which were supposed to be supported by this printserver, which is why I bought it. I have never been able to print a single page from my HP 1020 and my Deskjet only prints partial pages. Many inquiries to customer support only results in ""driver problems"" responses. Not acceptable. I have been tweeking this thing for several months and it simply does not work as claimed. The drivers are current, the firmware is updated, the network is stable and this product is basically a piece of junk."
1,"First DOA, Second completely unresponsive... returned","Don't buy this product. The first one I got was DOA, plugged it in, nothing happened. I returned that one to Bestbuy, picked up a second one, that one worked for about 5 minutes then became completely unresponsive. D-Link must have had a bad batch of these come off the assembly line. I suggest avoiding it all together, I returned mine and bought a Belkin, works great and with far more printers."
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!,THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!!! IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH ALMOST NO PRINTERS AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER JUST TO FIND OUT WHICH PRINTERS IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH!!! THEY SHOULD REALLY HAVE A PLACE WRITTEN WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHICH PRINTERS ARE COMPATIBLE BEFORE I SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,RangeBooster G for DPR-1260 Print Server,Both the print server and the RangeBooster G are excellent products. I highly recommend both.
4,Work good but some models not compatable,Great product but compatibility sometime is a issue. Find out if the printer/scanner you own compatible with it before you buy it. Setup in Vista is a pain.
2,not for Mac,I bought this since we had both PC and Mac computers. The carton said it worked on both. That is true But it does not easily go unto a Mac. It took me 1 hour with their support who admitted they had no Mac knowledge I than spent another hour with Apple who at least got me familiar enough to know how to add the IP address etc on the Mac. Than I took the PC info and manually put it on the Mac. Yes it works now but 2 hours of customer support?? Yuck! The manuel is poorly written and difficult to understand. It is written entirely for installation on a PC. Even for a person knowledgeable in Windows the instructions are cryptic and difficult to follow. It is designed to be installed from the internet but the installation works on a PC. Safari and Firefox cannot work with the web page. The CD is once again only for a PC.
4,Works well with Brother HL-4040CDN,"Was able to set this up with the Brother HL-4040CDN color laser printer. Works great. Only drawback was had to reconfigure router into WMA security instead of WEP. Now my wireless MP3 won't sync with computer. I have to attach MP3 via cable in order to update as MP3 will not work with WMA. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything."
1,In the trash,"Doesn't even recognize my Lexmark X83, doesn't like the HP PSC 2100, can't find the access point even though my laptop gives five bars signal strength at the same location."
2,Wireless Connection Doesn't Work So Well,"I have an hp LaserJet 1012 which is a supported printer model. I was able to print if I connected directly to the print server via Ethernet. Using the wireless connection, on the other hand, is hit or miss. Sometimes the print server would connect to my wireless router, sometimes not. I have a Netgear wireless router model MR814v2 which is about 3 years old."
1,I feel so insecure!,"With so many other reviews about the issues with this product I won't go in too many details. Basically I've been looking for a wireless print server that would handle multi-function devices. I can't really say too much about the long term use of product since after an hour with level 2 tech support it seemed the only way to get this thing connected to my network was to go either with WEP or no security at all - neither of which was acceptable to me. I decided to look around and see if I could find some solutions online but during the 24 hours I did so the device disconnected 5 times even on WEP. Back it goes.btw, I love that in the individual ratings for this product there is a choice for ""Clarity of manuel"". Was he the guy helping me on tech support?"
1,Horrible. Do not buy unless you enjoy endless frustration.,"I bought this print server about 5 years ago, and it's been an endless source of frustration for me. I should've returned it right away because it was misrepresented as ""the only print server to work with multi-function printers"". I knew no print server could work with a scanner (just doesn't go both ways) when I was researching it, but D-Link claimed that it specifically allowed the scanner to work wirelessly. Never did, and never got a direct answer from them about it. From having to unplug the USB cable umpteen times to losing access to it's webpage after a factory restore, it's time for it to GO! Getting a Linksys. D-Link, BTW... horrible, horrible support. Worst I've ever seen, as a matter of fact. Good riddance, DP-1260!"
1,Avoid this Rangebooster at All Cost,"D-Link DPR-1260 RangeBooster G Multifunction Print ServerThis was ordered for a Christmas gift for my son. When installed, it worked only partially. He contacted Technical Support, which first insisted that there was a secret list of printers on which it would work, and his printers were not on the list. Then, they guided him through the re-install process repeatedly until the brief warranty period expired. Then, they informed him that the product was out of warranty. Worst of all, after their help, it does not work at all. Some Christmas gift!"
1,Incompatible With Most Printers,"I have to concur with the negative reviews below. Before you buy this product, CHECK THE D-LINK PAGE TO SEE IF YOUR PRINTER IS COMPATIBLE! If it's not one of the 20 or so printers that have been designated as ""compatible,"" and you're not a certified network technician, you probably will not be able to get your printer to work with it.There are hundreds of different printers on the market; what's the use of a print server that will only work with a few dozen? From what I have read, only certain HP and Epson printers will work with this device--no other printers, no other brands. My Canon printer was completely incompatible with the print server. I tried connecting using the D-Link setup wizard--nothing. I tried manually connecting via IP address--nothing. Maybe a networking expert could get this piece of junk to recognize my printer; I'm not a computer novice by any means, and I certainly couldn't. I'm returning it and continuing my search for a better product."
5,Great price--Great Product,"Successful feedback on ALL print servers on Amazon hovers around 3 stars, it seems to me, after looking at dozens of print servers, that compatibility is the biggest weakness of ALL print servers. Well that and people who don't know what they are doing when setting up a print server. Remember that printers have always been and will most likely always be finicky pieces of hardware and the more we demand out of them the more we can possibly be unhappy. This D-link print server worked flawlessly on my HP 6540 desk-jet printer. The DPR-1260 has a firmware update (which I did not use) that I believe is only 2 years old which improves on the printers this device is compatible with. It came with adequate instructions and a nifty cd if you desire automation during setup which I did not use so I can not speak towards the usefulness of said cd, but I'd bet it would work fine. Bottom line for $40 to transform up to 4 printers or scanners into wifi devices it's worth the risk."
5,Works just like it should,I had some problems sharing my multi-function HP printer on my home network. Sharing it from the computer it was connected to didn't work consistently and none of the computers trying to access could use the scanning functionality. I plugged in and configured this print server and it worked immediately on 3 different laptops. I love it when a product you purchase works like it should.
3,Good print server but not refurbished,This D-Link print server is a good product but it was sold as a refurbished unit. Refurbished by who? It was just a USED unit not refurbished. Amazon should check there vendors better. That being said the print server is not hard to set up and works quite well with good range and reliability. I recomend this product if it was new or really refurbished.
4,Works great,"I got this because my brother and I have accumulated a number of printers, each of which serves different purposes. Having something like this to consolidate all of them in a common area in the house only made sense.Installation was seamless and using different printers couldn't be easier. What I found intriguing and others probably find enigmatic is that it actually uses the manufacturer's driver software to use devices.I haven't tried it with any multi-function devices yet, but I'm confident that I won't have any problems.Update: 10/2009Some months ago, I decided to switch all my computers to Ubuntu Linux. Of course, one of my main concerns was accessing the printers on this print server. I made it harder than it really was. Using the LPD/LPR setting, setting the host to the IP address of the server, and using the Queue name listed for the printer was all it took. Of course, you need to select the correct driver for the printer, but it was that easy."
2,Confused Tech Support,"Before I purchased this product I looked on the D-Link website to see if it was compatible with my Canon Pixma MX 310 all in one printer; my printer was not on the compatible list. Next I e-mailed D-Link tech support who said it may work even if not on the list. I hooked it all up and followed directions; computer saw the printer but it would not print. E-mail tech support said call telephone tech support. Telephone tech support is American, not outsourced--hurray. Telephone tech support then said ""If your printer is not on the supported printer list I can't assist you, you're on your own"". Canon claims to have a Silex print server that supports all Canon PIXMA printers--we'll see. Follow up: the Silex print server works as promised - took several calls to effective(American)tech support but it works.This printer / print server problem is disgusting; they sell hundreds of thousands of products, should have accurate, reliable, up to date info on compatibility."
2,Save yourself the headache,"I have owned this print server for about three years now. Each time I change my router I dread having to touch this print server. It is finicky with all the required steps that have been written here before. I work in IT and each time I touch this thing, it's a multiple day adventure and will then just start working one day for no apparent reason - FUN!! When you do get it working, it will just stop working for no reason and require a reset. Do yourself a real favor and just buy a printer with a wireless adapter... or if you really enjoy pain, just hit your head with a hammer - it's cheaper."
1,the worst router ever,#1 it does not always work its limited or no connectivity 99% of the time#2 i live in a high crime neighborhood so people always try to steal the signal and they succeed!#3 it you can speak Spanish call support because they can not understand English!!!!!#4 bad signal#5 DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER
4,good product,"I wasn't sure this would be a good buy but since setting it up, I have had no problems at all. It can be a little tricky to set up if you aren't a networking whiz, but spend an hour or two to set it up and you are good to go. I used it for a Brother HL-5140 laser printer and my computers run windows xp and 7.EDIT: I changed my rating to 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 because I occasionally have to restart the router when it freezes. I would still recommend the purchase though."
1,Got a defective item,Received item. Power on the item doesn't light up. Call DLink tech support found out that the item was defective. Returning item to Amazon. Looking for another one.
1,Do NOT buy this,"I bought the first one at Circuit City, didn't work out of the box. The unit kept freezing and becoming unresponsive when interacting with it through the web interface. It seems as if DLINK had a HUGE batch of defective units because of the other comments on here and also because when I called tech support they decided I needed an RMA in about 5 seconds. They basically just took the serial number and said that the unit needed to be replaced. So I shipped it back on my dime and they sent me a refurbished replacement. The setup manual of the replacement contained the desperate notes of another poor sap trying unsuccessfully to get his defective product to work over what must have been hours of telephone support sessions. Of course, it was also DOA. I called tech support and got disconnecting several times. I threw the unit in the garbage."
1,Wasting my time!!!,"I purchased this d-link DPR-1260 to connect to a Belkin F5D7230-4 router on a HP Windows XP PC to connect a HP Laserjet P2015d. Followed instructions on set up sheet. Once completed and removed ethernet- it would not work wirelessly. After long hold times (greater than 30 minutes) and numerous phone calls to both d-link and Belkin and a bad case of you need to call the other manufacturer for set-up info- it never would work wirelessly.I returned this item, purchased a Linksuys WPSM 54G and had it up and running wirelessly in 15 minutes.I will never buy d-link agin and usggest you reconsider.I can handle install/operating issues - but poor, ineffective tech service is not acceptable."
1,Garbage,"I didn't buy from Amazon.com, which wouldn't be better, because the D-Link customer department is a Joke.The DPR-1260 didn't work properly for months, I tried to reach the technical support, but they were unable to solve the problem, and return or change the item.I will never buy anything from D-Link.DON'T BUY IT !"
1,Two attempts to install - both failed,"I attempted to install this product twice. Once after I requested a replacement from Amazon. After one hour each time with D-Link technical support, I could not get it to work.I would not recommend a purchase. Look elsewhere."
1,"DON'T BUY THIS, WASTE OF MONEY","I got this last December and it worked for only a few months. Then it would randomly stop connecting to my wireless network and recognizing my printer. I would have to unplug both, plug it back in and it would work again. Then early in the summer, it just stopped connecting all together. No matter what I did, I couldn't get this PS to connect to my network, even when connected through Ethernet to the router. When I would log into my router and look at attached devices, the PS would not show but the PS showed all the correct status lights. I called customer service and RMA'd my unit. That's when the fun started, the next unit they sent me, DID NOT WORK right out of the box. So I went to the DLink forums and did some more research and found out this is common. There is something wrong with the design of this unit and a huge number of people are having this connectivity issue. Just save yourself the hassle and buy something else."
4,Works even though my printer wasn't on the list,"I bought this product and I am quite pleased with it as it works just as I thought it would. I had some trouble setting it up and called the technical support line, but they said it wouldn't work on my printer, so I hung up with them and kept playing around with it and was able to get it to work. My printer is in a closet and I don't have any issues with the door being closed at all. My router is tucked away under a desk about 10 feet away in another room and it works. I am very pleased with this product. The reason I only gave it four stars was due to the lack of support I received when I called the technical support line. I don't think they have fully tested this on all products that work with it."
1,"Dlink Rangebooster""G"" Print Server",The product did not work out of the box. Spent 2-3 hours on phone with tech support before they decided that it was defective. Not as easy to set up as they say. Amazon was great in that they sent out a new one without hasseling me about any thing.Dlink wanted me to pay shipping for defective product to return it to them :<(. Havent tried the new one yet.
4,Works great. Occasionally needs a reset.,"I bought this print server about a year ago. I've been using it with a Samsung laser printer and a Canon photo ink jet. Both work great with the server. The only issue I've had is that if you don't print to the server at least once per day, then it has a habit of disappearing from my network. It will come back with a power cycle. I solved this by installing a lamp timer on the server so that it power cycles each day in the middle of the night. Ever since then it's been flawless."
5,Magnificent,"I was born and raised in Vermont, have lived out of the state for years, visiting annually. This book really did bring me home to the Soul of Vermont. The photographs are wonderful. They just take you in. If you want to spend some time in Vermont and can't make the trip, this is THE book for you."
4,Nice cofee table book for Vermont Lovers,"I have a big collection of Vermont coffee table books, and I must say that this is not my favorite, only because I would have liked to see more diversity - a lot of the pictures are of the same area - Peacham- a beautiful place - don't get me wrong. That said, the photography is very nice and the photos really capture the essence of Vermont and the country life. Mr. Brown really does justice to the farm animals as well I just would have like to see more photos of other areas. I do recommend if you love the state."
1,Another waste of money,"This one is really a stinker!!! How come is Shogo remembered , what happened to Eve? Those people there are playing video games and then they find the Bahamud? I dont understant what is happening in this movie..and I think the animators really missed the point."
2,Ughhh...part 3...,"I won't bother elaborating too much on this title here, but rest assured, it suffers from the same faults as Part I and II, but has a story that does not even relate to the original series (OVAs).I was a fool to buy all three at $21.99 each, not knowing how terrible they would be.Lesson learned."
4,Chameleon Twist: The Next Generation in Children Exploration,"This game is, in a word, GREAT. All children 10 and under will find hours of fun in this adventurous quest to ""beat the bad guys."" You are represented on the screen by a three dimensional chameleon. Your mission is simple: Make your way through the challenging levels that require strategy. Your weapon, transportation, and all-around tool: A long, shapable, twistable, foldable tongue."
5,Well thought out.,The questions are well thought out and interesting. This book has challenged me to revist my past and my family's past. Most important it has guided me to what it is that I want my children to know and remember about it all.
5,A Must for Every Family,"As other reviewers have noted, the questions listed are thought provoking. I remembered things from my childhood that I hadn't thought of for years. This book is truly a gift for the generations that follow."
5,"New book, quickly received","I read an excerpt of this book online via Amazon and was glad to find a new copy at a great price from this seller. It arrived very quickly, too!"
1,All your friends should pass on this book,"This is one horrible book. As tasty as a very watered down broth. One throw away line after another - such as ""three very wet dogs swimming"". The story is oh so empty and oh so predictable - nothing follows - not zany, not comedic, not insightful, not sad nor funny - etc. A total waste of time - the only solice is that you can read through this book in an hour and not be provoked into any thought or emotion at all - I for one would suggest taking a nap instead - even the potential of dreaming holds more interest than this wet noodle of a novel."
2,Meandering Plot,"I purchased this book because I'm a Larry McMurtry fan. I wish I had read Terms of Endearment and Moving On before this book. Perhaps I would have had a better mental context for the characters. To me, the plot simply rambles without sufficient motivation or purpose and ends in pointless frustration. Perhaps fiction mimics life, but I'm expecting more from fiction than mimicry. As a story, it simply meanders past memorable characters. I was continually frustrated by what seemed to be incompleteness."
2,"Stellar start, pathetic finish","I bought this book after reading the first two pages in the bookstore... I was hooked. I thought I was in store for another hilarious, vivid, and relevent McMurtry great. Instead, after about fifty pages I realized that it was simply a silly sex fest. The main charachter's woes are not a result of the impossibility of having a normal life and relationship while being an artist -- no, his problems come from marrying stupidly and being a male slut. He even chooses child molesters as his friends. His final, rapid decline is a direct result of his sleeping with every woman who wanders into the story ... including his best friend's wife. This has nothing to do with being an artist. McMurtry has written much, much better. Try Texasville."
1,Waste of precious reading time,"This book is being deleted from my Kindle as a waste of time and space...not funny, not good writing...shame on Larry McMurtry...shame on me for buying it..."
