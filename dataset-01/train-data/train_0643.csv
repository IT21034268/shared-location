5,Mogwai have mastered some sort of evil sorcery...,"...And they are using it to transform their instruments into dinosaurs halfway through their songs. ""My Father My King"" begins with a slow, eerie Jewish melody which over the course of the song mutates into a raging, firebreathing torrent of noise. As each instrument is added the tension builds and flows between quiet and loud, until the sound just overflows and peters out in a rabble of pedalled static. Epic, frightening and livid, this is the defining sound of Mogwai crammed into a single song. A nice one to listen to in the dark by yourself, or when you're in a particularly vindictive frame of mind.A note: Get the Australian version if you can, it comes with 2 live 'hidden' tracks: ""Helicon 1"" and ""You Don't Know Jesus""."
3,Bad audio system,"It's good looking. We bought it because of its style. It also has good picture, and good sound when its audio system is normal. However, serveral day after we bought it, the sound system began to make noise once in a while, and when it's making noise, what we can hear is just noise. The noise can be from any channel.Forgot to mention, this is 2nd Philips 25PS40S we have had. We are going to return it for the same reason as we did for the 1st one: the noise."
3,not on trouble shooter list,"I own a philips 27 inch television, model 27ps55ss, one day a few weeks ago while surfing with the remote the channel froze on screen and there was no sound. Nothing I did to change the situation helped. I changed the batteries, but nothing, I couldn't turn off the tv using the remote. I even was forced to get up out of my chair and tried to turn off the tv manually. Still nothing worked, until I pulled the cord from the wall and started all over again.It worked fine for a few hours then the same problem happened again. I called philips 800 number and no one there ever heard of such a problem(lucky me). THANK GOD FOR COSTCO, NO QUESTIONS ASKED THEY REFUNDED MY MONEY AND I PURCHASED AGAIN THE SAME MODEL.(2 days later) so far so good. RAUL"
2,A disappointment,"When you compare this dvd to the 1993 performance in the Proctors Theatre New York, it really is a disappointment. She is like a complete different person now, without the vocal power of 15 years ago. If you ask me, I would rather listen to the 1993 version of Hero, than this one.I do have to say that the picture and audio quality of this dvd is really good but that doesn't make it a good concert. Just buy the older dvd's of Mariah and don't waste your money on this."
5,Well... I loved it,"Well... I could review like a normal person... ""it's a great concert performance, blah blah blah"". Let's be honest... I like Mariah Carey cause she sings well and she's hot. So if you like her music and you wanna see her dancing around in her skimpy outfits this is the way to go. Plus the I'll Be There cover and One Sweet Day with Boyz II Men were wonderful!!"
4,She is a good singer,I am not the biggest M(I need attention)C fan - but the girl can sing. She has good people making her music and its best on Blu Ray! The price is quite reasonable too!
4,I Don't Have The DVD BUT I Have Seen This Concert,"From a concert standpoint, it isn't Mariah's best but she still puts on a good show. The voice isn't quite what it was years ago but she can still outsing a lot of these so-called pop stars these days!She sings many of her best hits from ""Its Like That"", ""Heartbreaker"", ""Dreamlover"" and ""Butterfly."" She even gets together with members of Boyz II Men for ""One Sweet Day."" Overall, a good (not great) concert. Short of 5 stars but is a 3 1/2 star concert (had to give her 4 since the star system doesn't allow half-stars).As a man personally though, I'll admit that Mariah isn't in the shape she used to be but what's up with all these ""fat"" comments! Quite frankly, for almost 40, she looks great! She isn't toned like she used to be (and to me if you are going to wear those kinds of outfits, you should be) but come on! She's hardly ""fat.""Anyway, back to this concert. It's worth a look but I'd find it cheaper than what it is being sold for."
1,I can't watch it,"Because we received the wrong Blu ray...we can't watch it here in the Netherlands.The region code is not right.We orderd 3 blu rays, two of them where good...and the most important one we can't see or hear.to bad....wasted money!"
1,She lost her voice!!! So Sad!!!,She lost her voice!!! So Sad!!!Nothing else to say more than recommending to you not to buy this trash...
1,YAWN!!,I've seen this DVD and nearly fell asleep! I couldn't believe how lifeless her show was! She didn't do anything but wobble around on high heels! No wonder she didn't sell out all her shows! ...and she is SO FAT! I HIGHLY recommend Madonna's Confessions tour DVD!!....THAT WAS A GOOD SHOW!!!
1,wrong regio code,"Unfortunately I havent seen anything, because you sent me this blue-ray dvd with a wrong regio code , so my playstation3 wasn't able to play it back. Surprisingly, the other one (I've ordered an other dvd (Shakira) at the same time) was good.Why you didn't mention the need for choosing the regio code during the ordering process?Would you be so kind to send me an other one with the good regio code?Thanks in advanceCsaba Bartos"
2,She barely sings her own songs.,"Mariah has one of the most beautifully gifted voices in the world. I love her new identity and the R & B direction that she went with her career.However, this concert is one of the worst I have seen. She barely sings to her songs, just adds styling in while her background singers belt it out. And the few times she actually sings her songs, you are almost relieved for her and for the fans that paid to see the concert. She rambles on and on in between songs and although she truly seems to love her fans and want to involve them, she does not reward them with well sung music.All that being said, it was watchable, but then again, a train wreck is possible too."
4,Good show,"I never watch any concert done by Mariah Carey, this is a good concert by her and too sexy to watch it with my children but still I enjoy to watch clarity quality of blu ray copy"
1,"Avoid buying from a seller called ""Caiman""","I am just writing this to help other customers avoid this type of seller called ""Caiman"". Straight to the point. I bought it a week early before bestbuy got it only for cheaper. I ended up paying $32 dollars with shipping when you can find it bestbuy for under $20. The other problem I had from this item was that it was international and there was no way I could play the dvd. The seller had this item under regional when it wasn't. I gave to my sister as a christmas present she is been waiting for a refund or a exchange. She got tired and when to buy at bestbuy. I am still waiting to get a refund or a exchange since the begining of January and as of today they told that they haven't received my returned item. I don't about other sellers but the safer way is to buy it directly from the store and not a seller. Directly from amazon if it ever becomes available or bestbuy."
3,The adventure Mimi Blu ray,"The worst concert of Mariah, the Blu ray have excellent quiality and sound but very, very bad show.She look fat and soo stupid. skip it"
3,A bit expensive,"I don't regret I bought this product and I got what I was expecting about its content but I have though few complain.The DVDs box arrived damaged and I find it too expensive especially when I realised that there were no subtitles, which are very handy for a non native English speaker and the quality of the videos was not great."
2,A little boring with not much information.,"Eh, I guess I was expecting something over-flowing with information but this was just general knowledge about mushrooms. Early they state that American know little about mushrooms, which is true, and then they proceed to give very little education about them. If it does anything it makes me want to watch something with a little more facts about mushrooms, maybe that was it's intent. . ."
1,This movie is TERRIBLE!,"I am so thoroughly disgusted with this documentary that I have stopped it and needed to write a review. There is almost no usable information in this film. The plot rambles along with no discerning direction. I was expecting a feast of information similar to ""Forks over Knives"" or other fine documentaries. Instead I sat through almost an hour of watching Tommy Chong's idiot unfunny brother.Looking at some of these reviews, I don't understand how someone can give this movie 4 or 5 stars."
4,Well made and fairly informative,"I'm not sure why the negative reviews. This is a well-made, entertaining documentary that provides a good introduction to mushrooms and the people who are fascinated by them. The film is whimsical with some fun graphics that were a lot more sophisticated than I had expected from I thought would be a really rough, low-budget affair. This is a polished piece of work. If you love mushrooms or want to introduce someone to them, I suspect you'll like this film."
2,"Mildy entertaining, not very informative","I'm glad I got this from the library. I'm newly interested in mushroom hunting and was hoping for a factual overview. Instead, this film is a mishmash of elements that I imagine would be entertaining to some people, but I was disappointed. In fact, the emphasis on the odd types (read: aging hippies) at, for example, the Telluride Festival was a real turn-off, though I'm grateful to be prepared if, indeed, mushroom events are full of odd characters getting off on being eccentric and unkempt. Bottom line, this dvd isn't very factually informative, but is nonetheless interesting -- or not -- depending on what you're looking for."
4,Fun to watch!,"Very informative, but I still would be a bit apprehensive about picking wild mushrooms and having them with my steak!"
5,KNOW YOUR MUSHROOMS,"i think the movie is awesome, this is what people need to know more, and about the benefits of fungi. i will defenately recommend this movie to any one that would like to know more about mushrooms."
3,Good for the Sale Price,"This is an ok product for what you pay. I wouldn't see paying over [$] for it though. The utensils are nice and big and the spatula and tongs are most useful. The wire brush is cheaply made though - the first time we used it, lots of bristles fell out. The carrying case is a nice idea, but the uensils don't all fit in their slots without a lot of coaxing. If you find the item ... for [$] dollars, go for it if only for the spatula and tongs, otherwise invest a few more dollars and get a nicer set."
3,This set is for HUGE HANDS,"I bought this set because I thought it was a good price. By looking at the picture, they appear to be average size. When I received them, I was shocked to see a box that was about 36 inches x 36 inches. When I openend the box, I saw why. These tools are HUGE. I have (I thought) big hands, but these tools are too big for me to use. Just using the tongs is a work out! I would not recommed buying these unless you have big hands. The spatula alone is 5 inches wide and 18 inches long. All of these tools are 18 inches long and are very heavy. The only thing I will be able to use out of this set is the scrub brush and the kabob skewers."
4,Wow These are HUGE!,"Sabatier makes wonderful equipment and this grill set is no exception. Like all the other reviewers said though... these things are really big! The box they arrived in looked like it could hold a computer. Wow! Anyway- they are a nice looking set and are very sturdy. The carrying case is a nice addition as well. I would not reccomend these for a small grill or for a small person. If you are a big time grill enthusiast with large hands and a super large grill, these will be great. The quality is number one!"
5,sabatier 11-piece bbq tool set with case,"This is the top of the line!! Best I have ever seen or used. The carring case is heavy duty, like shop tool tote bags are made of. With this quality you don't need any kind of warranty!!"
3,Definitely HEAVY Duty,"This is an excellent quality BBQ tool set, but WOW are the pieces ever big. I recommend it with reservations only about the size. The handles are huge, and my medium-sized female hands can't grasp and close the tongs. However, I will use all the other pieces and I don't think I'll ever have to buy BBQ tools again. The carrying case is great too - very sturdy and convenient."
3,BIG on quality...,"This set is made of quality material, and is nice looking, but THE TOOLS ARE ENORMOUS!! Be advised that you'll need big hands. I originally bought these for my sister, but after receiving them, decided to give them to my brother-in-law (who is a big guy). If we all ate hamburgers the size of that spatula, cows would quickly become an endangered species......"
2,Made In China...Sabatier? How about Sabatiang!,"Not great...*Handles are poorly finished.*Made in China - I thought this stuff was French?*Brush is not durable.*Tools are HUGE - great size for Yao Ming, Shaq or any other seven-footers on your gift list.*You get what you pay for!"
3,A Journey The Autobiography of Apolo Anton Ohno,"The book was in good condition. However, I was disappointed that there was a personal note made by the original owner and this information was not noted in the book description/condition."
5,Looks great.,"Looks just like it does online, just much bigger.Purchased with the black wood frame. Don't know if it's worth $55 but it looks very nice framed. Their is glass protecting the poster, and the frame itself seems sound in quality as well as in appearance.I wanted to get canvas but didn't want to wait 3-5 weeks. My walls where this is going are very ugly.Overall I am pleased with what I received and would buy it again should I have to do it over.Jess"
3,For children over 8 years old only,"It is an interesting concept but I would recommend only to children over 8 years old, with the fact they might get bored after the first day. The mechanism works poorly. But I do believe as an educational toy it serves a purpose, as soon as children are introduced to a first level of complex mechanisms."
4,all was not lost!,"I have used these storage boxes under the beds for a long time. Recently we had a slight flood when a water pipe broke. There was a good 1/2 of standing water throughout three bedrooms. Nothing was lost (except the hardwood flooring) because all the storage on the floor was in these plastic boxes. Protecting my stuff from a flood was not my original intent with these boxes, I just needed storage. It had never even occurred to me that the casters are external to the storage area which means the interior of the box has no holes. I was so grateful when I realized how lucky I had been. Luckily I also use plastic bins to store things on the floor in the closets. My ONLY complaint is that under our twin beds they don't fit flush, the box sticks out slightly. If only they were about three inches shorter."
3,good but could be better,"Quality of bins are fairly good, and the wheels are a nice touch. They were the selling feature for me combined with the double-sided lift lid. However, if there is anything in the bins the slightest bit too tall, the lids don't stay locked down. I'm disappointed with this feature. The closures could be a bit better quality. I find I'm not able to really use the bins either under my bed. i have a thick rug which makes them just a bit too tall to fit well under the bed. I could buy bed risers but I don't feel like spending more money. I'll have to find a different solution now for storing these bins. I was hoping they would solve my storage problem but now I have a new one."
3,Light and entertaining,"Very light reading; you'll finish quickly. At times, I wondered if I had already read this book because it was so similar (in the way the plot developed) to one other book by Bright."
4,A great beginning for a great series!,"I love this series so far. This first book in the series, Invitation To Murder is great! With cozies it is important not to try and analyze too much and to just enjoy. I dont think it is such a far out idea that someone could make a living on a card making shop. I would definately recommend this to people who want a light and fun read."
2,Questionable,I bought this to make cookies for Diwali and unfortuantely it did resemble a body part. So make sure when decorating to differentiate the colors such that the base is a diff color than the candle.
5,exciting high-scoring match,"The DVD label calls this a quarter-final match, which it is not--it's the final pool match between New Zealand and Wales, both 3-0 at the time, both going on to the quarter-finals. The winner would play South Africa, the loser would play England (considered a tougher opponent than South Africa). Wales had last beaten the All Blacks in 1953, and the Al Blacks were the heavy favorite here.What ensued was a wide-open high-scoring match: the score was 28-24 at the half, with plenty of more scoring yet to come. You'll see some dramatic battles at the trylines, and you'll also see strategic decisions to spurn close chip-shot penalty kicks in favor of scrums in the hope of achieving tries. It's all very exciting, a well-played match, with good production values. Certainly an enjoyable match to watch!"
2,Pretentious,"Every time I take a chance on a mystery album like this I regret it, and this is no exception. Of course the school attack was a horrible tragedy. But this CD's pretentiousness and total lack of musical structure does not serve as any sort of fitting tribute. It's amazing how little can be done with a studio, voices, and off-beat instruments."
4,Great apron for the Cowboy fan in your life,"I purchased this apron over a year ago for my boyfriend. He was a HUGE Dallas fan (until the Bledsoe incident), I needed a creative gift, and this ended up being perfect. It's a basic white apron - nothing overly fancy - but it seems like a sturdy material. The Dallas logo has stayed on through several washings. The merchant also had the item shipped out very quickly, which was great."
3,Fleur de Sel compairison,I was served some fleur de sel in a restaurant in Paris that was quite a bit different from this one. Perhaps it came from a different region or was processed differently. The Camargue product wasn't as coarse as the other and didn't have the usual pinkish/grey color. I was disappointed in the difference in the taste.
4,A classic fun game.,"This is a great game. I've loved it since I first played it pre- Episode 1. It was a blast to play, easy to play, and they're all mini games and fun side trips. I had this game as a teen and loved it. Unfortunately, that copy broke one day and I could never find a replacement locally. It wasn't until I remembered it while I was on Amazon and I had to buy it. It still is great to play to this day. The downfall... Well the downfall is, with so much updated technology (software and hardware), the videos no longer play unless you're running Windows 98 or something. The videos use an old version of QuickTime that newer versions ignore. So no matter how many times I updated Quicktime, I still couldn't get the videos to run. Which is a bummer, cause some of those were such a blast. But anytime you can whack an Ewok off a bridge with Darth Vader cheering you on, well, that's a great time."
4,Great tunes.,Not a very popular CD. But if you like old skool acid/techno/house this is a good CD to own.
4,Joe Ely Rocks!,"This is a great CD--tons of fun! When I saw the tracks listed, I thought I could do without yet another version of ""Me and Billy the Kid,"" but I was wrong. For folks needing an introduction to Joe Ely, this is a great record to get."
4,Great Texas Music!,"This is a very good live album. Most of the cuts are available on other CD's, but this one captures some of the excitement that Joe generates in person. Very enjoyable!"
2,This item is not a book. It is a collection of 24 note cards.,A mistake was made in listing this item as a book. I did not receive a book. I received a box with 24 note cards. The box is attractive. The note cards are attractive. But I was expecting a book on Tiffany windows. So please be careful if you are considering buying this item.
2,This is NOT an antenna extension,"I bought this thinking it would work to extend the antenna on my my netgear WG311Twireless adapter. But it does not. The cable is Reverse-SMA female to Reverse-SMA female,and I need Reverse-SMA female to Reverse-SMA male. Now I need a double Reverse-SMA maleadapter, and I have searched the net and have concluded they do not exist. So I planto return this cable and buy the correct one -- it looks like StarTech makes one.I am very disappointed."
5,Johhny Winter,"I love these albums! Some of best ever!! The Live And album is one of best, if not the best live album ever!"
3,Alternative to Straight Blues,"This album is an interesting addition for Winter fans because instead of his typical blues trip, the rock/pop material and the colaboration with Derringer add other dimensions, while the live cuts supply any blues you might have been missing."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...an awesome, original voice whose music you are trying desperately to love, but ultimately it's in need of a good producer."
5,Outstanding entertainment.,I would recommend this movie to those that love a good murder mystery.Sean Connery and Mark Harmon are wonderful.Had to have this movie for my collection.
3,"not bad, not great",Not a bad movie. Not a fan of meg ryan. I wanted to watch this movie because I had just gotten back from San Francisco and thought it would be cool to watch this movie since it's set in SF. Sean Connery is great as usual. So is Hamilton. The storyline is a little rushed and the movie is really just dated. But still not bad for the price. Wish I hadn't have ordered the widescreen version. Aggravating to watch in that format.
5,Will Keep this one,"Ordered because of the actors but found the story easy to follow.I don't tear a movie apart - just enjoy it. And this is one I liked. Couldn't stand Meg Ryan's hairdo though. Too messy!After watching NCIS I wanted to see some earlier movies of Mark Harmon [definitely liked his character in West Wing last year - the dogs had to kill him off]Sean Connery is always well worth watching - good or bad.What can I say, I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again.Certainly enjoyed the ""thumb"" scene action. Do it again Mac.Yup! our guys are aging well!Will Recommend [but it is your choice]"
5,Connery and Harmon,Except for some language issues this is a very good movie for couples. Mark's mannerisms of today (NCIS) are already evident. Connery and Harmon interact very well and throw in a very good supporting cast to go with a good storyline; and you have a very good night at the movies.
4,PRESIDEO,"I ENJOYED SEAN CONNERY ESPECIALY ENJOYED THE FIGHT SEEN, IN THE COFFEE SHOP.I LOVE THE SENERY.I LIKED THE STORY LINE AND I LIKED THE SUPPORTING ACTORS."
3,Cheesy,"Kind of cheesy, in an amusing, enjoyable way. Only Meg Ryan, supposedly Connery's wild and dangerous daughter, is unwatchable in this movie."
3,Presidio,Would have been an even better movie if some one else had played Harmin's part. This guy is really full of himself.
2,Peter Hyams directs another Snoozer ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Pretty mundane stuff from director Peter Hyams as usual. Mark Harmon plays an obnoxious San Francisco police detective who investigates a murder that took place on local military base, and goes head to head with an old army bureaucrat, the presidio's chief provost, unconvincingly played by Sean Connery. Strictly Hyams' usual uninspired formula is at work here. It is still interesting to watch Connery in a role that he is totally miscast and see just how he approaches this character. Bruce Broughton's score is not bad."
4,entertaining,"It's not the greatest thriller out there, but its decent enough to enjoy if you just don't assume that its a bad movie. Sean Connery does an excellent job, and Mark Harmon is not as wooden as other reviews would have you believe; he is at least comparable to his role in Navy CIS on tv. The action scenes are good, especially the foot chase in Chinatown. And the San Francisco locations are used to create a nice atmosphere. Connery and Harmon play off each other quite nicely and there are many scenese of subtle humor...a good movie."
1,Even beefcake can't save a crappy script,"Who wrote this thing? Slow, didactic, banal, tedious, just kill me now... I wanted some vintage action. Instead I got a screenful of dissapointment."
4,Presidio DVD Review,"This is an entertaining movie with good cast and a fine score by Bruce Broughton. This ""I love the 80s"" DVD claims that the film is presented in widescreen and enhanced for 16:9 TVs; however, the 2.35:1 film is NOT enhanced for widescreen TVs. The picture and sound are clear, though."
2,Rants in every chapter,"I bought this book expecting it to have lyrical prose, close observations of nature and a spiritual perspective. I was going to give it as a gift, and after reading other reviews I expected it to be uplifting. Before I gift wrapped it, I dipped into it in a few places and was surprised to see the writer expressing disappointment in how people treat nature as the main thrust in every essay I reviewed. Sadness was the emotion I felt. I went back to it at three different times, just to make sure that my evaluation remained the same.I agree with the author that people are desecrating Nature at every turn, but that was not what I expected to find in this book, based on the other reviews. Not only that, this book popped up on my recommendations list because I was searching for Loren Eisley, and its prose is -- well, prosaic.I returned the copies I bought. It just wasn't for me, even to pass on."
1,the tracks here are not what they ship you,wzup all Z-ro fans out there. Do not buy this c.d. because the tracks which are listed on amazon for this c.d. are not the tracks that are going to be shipped to you when you get your c.d. I was very upset because I already have this item regular version and chopped and they gon send me the chopped version. So if I was a customer I would not order this c.d. if you are looking for these specific tracks cause you wont get it.
1,Water Surge Shock Absorber (660-H),The product did not work at all and the loud noise is still on and the company refuse to take the product back. I do not think this is the same product as shown by Amazon. Well live and learn Bo
1,Waste of money,"Installed at cold water inlet washing machine. This product is useless, has no effect on water hammering. Save your money"
1,Picture shown is not what you get,The item you are ordering is a 660-H Sioux Chief water hammer arrester. The problem is that the picture shown implies an in-line coupling configuration. What you will receive is a 660-H Sioux Chief water hammer arrester but the coupling configuration is 90 degrees (check out the Sioux Chief website to verify). This may not work in certain situations. The water hammer arrester technology presented by Sioux Chief works like a charm if you can accommodate the 90 degree coupling configuration (I couldn't - hence my rating).
2,"Sioux Chief Mfg 660-H 3/4"" Hose Thread Mini Rester",We had a water hammer noise through our water lines when the washing machine automatic valves closed during the washing cycle. Installing the Sioux Chief 660-H eliminated the noise. We purchased two. Very easy to install on both the hot and cold shut off valves at the wall.
5,"Fantastic product, does the job!","I have owned a Bosch HE washer for almost 10 years and it banged our pipes no matter how hard I tried to secure the pipes better. I thought they were improperly secured to the ceiling joists. No one ever told me that HE washers often cause this..I assumed it was our plumbing. I also tried to ""burp"" our water pipes by turning off the water and opening all the taps. Sometimes this helped a bit but the sound of the water hammer drove me nuts, esp. as our washer is directly below our den where I tend to sit and read or watch tv.Then I discovered this item. Bough a pair of them, installed on the Bosch and WOW! It completely eliminated the problem. Don't wait as long as I did..if you have a HE washer and have water hammer....this should work for you like it did for me. Nice that they appear solidly constructed and made in the USA too."
5,works great,"I put this on the washing machine side of the hose, and all my water hammering problems went away. I am using an LG washer front load.(I do not recommend the LG washer)."
4,stop the thumps,"These are great for eliminating the thumps associated with the water turning on an off of our high efficiency washer. I just wished they lasted longer. We put two together and a mild sound has returned in less than a month. The next step is to attach four to one another. Maybe that will work since, hopefully, each one will not experience as much surge."
5,Works Perfectly,"We just moved into our first house and the washing machine created the loudest water hammer noises I've ever heard--as in ""Did a car just hit the house??"" level of noise and this is in our living room which is the opposite end of the house from where the washer is located (and the washer is one level down in the basement)... it would do this at least 10+ times during a load, more if you used a setting other than just ""COLD"".I installed these and the water hammer is 100% gone, there is no audible noise what so ever due to water hammer.IMPORTANT:These will screw directly onto the back of your washing machine, so you don't need to worry about whether your faucet outputs are at the correct angle for it or not. I didn't realize this when I bought them so I ended up buying two 90* adapters which in the end I didn't have to use.I highly rec. these for anyone w/ any water hammer noise!"
4,"fixed water hammer on Samsung washer, the rubber washer caused a leak","fixed water hammer problem with my Samsung wf330. Dont use the rubber washer comes with package, its a cheap rubber, cause a leak. So I put a water alarm next to Samsung washer."
2,Not very effective,"Bought and installed one for hot and cold water lines for our new LG washer. They dampened but did not eliminate the water hammer from our machine for the first few weeks, but now the water hammer has resumed full force. They are attached at the spigot, but within the 6 feet of hose as recommended by the company."
5,No more banging pipes.,"Our new washing machine was making our pipes bang as it turned the flow of water on and off. These shock absorbers screwed right onto the back of the washing machine without any tools. Immediately, the banging pipes were quiet."
2,Helps,"I put one on the hot water connection and one on the cold water connection of my washing machine. They reduced the water hammer fequency and severity, but they did not eliminate they problem."
3,Not sure they helped,I recently purchased front load washer and started to have pipe knocking when using the washer. I purchased these and they were easy to install but I still get knocking although it may be less than before.
5,Excellent product,"Like many other reviewers, my new LG washing machine turns the inlet water on and off quickly several times while it is filling. I don't know why it's designed like this, but it creates very bad water hammer in our plumbing. It sounds literally like someone is banging on the pipes with a hammer where the water comes into the house when the washer is filling. I was skeptical that this product would solve our problems, but was pleasantly surprised -- amazed, in fact. I installed one on the cold and one on the hot water inlets on the washer. Installation was quick and easy and the product appears solid and very will made. After installing these, our plumbing was completely silent as the washer filled. These devices completely exceeded my expectation."
5,Real Noise stopper,This is a great product. It totally eliminated the annoying banging noise that occured when the washer is filling.The washer is now as quiet as a church mouse.
4,Surge Protector For Home Theater,"It met with my requirements and the price was right, besides it came on time. So far, I have not encountered any problem with its functioning."
5,Nice and compact,This seems to work just fine. It is small enough to fit behind the tv stand and not be seen.Looks to be of good quality.
5,Fabulous,I purchased two of these at different times so this review is the same as the first review... This item is excellent!
4,Good one,This is a very important item and I purchased this to safeguard other valuable electronics to protect from surge or spike. The real use of this item is only when you encounter such a disaster. Hope that won't come. It has a separate line for cable/telephone cord. This is also an important feature. Overall looks great.
5,Works for me,I bought this for a media cabinet I was building. I knew I liked what I was buying because I bought one 2-3 years ago at a big box store. This cost 40-50% less.
5,What a great deal,"After the recent storms I decided to get a couple of these for my whole house. Cant beat the price on these ($22 when I got them). It does not have an Ethernet port like some surge protectors do, however all my internet devices are connected to one so there is not not a need for one. I would never buy Monster at full price but they are a great brand for home entertainment products."
3,It's alright.,"Seems well built, but haven't seen it doing anything yet, other than resetting it self all of a sudden for no reason."
4,"Good quality, a little dated...","You can't argue with Monster's quality. This works great, the long cord is huge plus. The only problem is in the names it has for the plugs. There is no label for Blu-Ray and there is one for VCR. This seems a little bit in the past, but besides this I have no complaints."
5,Works as expected,"It's a surge protector so there's not much to say;1) It appears to be working (haven't had any surges yet)2) The color coding is a nice touch and helps when unplugging cables3) Came with a short coaxial cable and telephone cable (I won't be using either, but if you need them it's a nice touch)"
1,Poor quality,The DVD quality is very poor. The picture is blurry and the sound is not clear. Seems it was recorded from VHS. Not worth the price.
5,Great Speakers...buy it and you'll know what you've missed.,"I love these speakers...worth every penny...here are the pros and cons:PROS-*Curved design makes for even sound*Magnetic shields mean you can place them next to your tv without problem*Dual binding posts for bi-amplification or bi-wiring*Sleek metallic finish with interesting curved design*Better bass response than the RM7400T/RM40T*Floor standing for convenient portabilityCONS-*Needs more equipment to get a ""complete"" home theater"
5,Product is great. The description is not!,"This is a simple hook that cleverly snaps into the drop ceiling T-Bars. If you are trying to hang a projector screen, you are probably realizing that you need two of these hooks. Well, you won't see it in the description that Amazon has for this product (or at least there wasn't when I purchased it), but there are actually two hooks in the package. So save your money and just buy one! By the way, the hook works great but they don't release once you snap them in. So make sure they are where you want them when they are first installed."
5,A good history of Pink Floyd,"I have always enjoyed listening to Pink Floyd and when I came across this book the first time, I could not put it down until I was done reading it. It is a wonderful look at the history of Pink Floyd. This book takes you from the very beginning all they way up to around when Momentary Lapse of Reason was releaced and gives you how and why each album was made and the band member's thoughts about each song."
1,Where's the almond?,"This ""marzipan"" arrived fresh, sweet, and cute, but the flavor of almonds, which makes marzipan, marzipan was non existant. Save your money on this one."
5,Wonderful Music and Harmony from some very Gifted Artists,I was pleasantly surprised after listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com which of course lead me to purchase this very nice Bluegrass Gospel CD. I was also surprised to see on the inserts that Mark Howard produced this CD and plays some of the instruments on the album. He has helped with Craig Duncan's nice Bluegrass Gospel CDs which I have previously purchased. I would highly recommend this CD as it does really have a nice old-fashioned church like sound and certainly honors our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The price was nice too.
5,may be the best MOH episode,"Brad Anderson, while still very young, is proving himself to be truly a master of horror. ""Session 9"", ""The Machinist"" and now this. Dang. It's great. Don't expect a balls-to-the-wall horror extravaganza, and you will like what you get. This is more Alfred Hitchcock than Lucio Fulci. Paced well, cerebral, and sounds great. Highly recommended."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"*contains spoilers*not as bad as The Damned Thing or The V Word, this episode has a main character who isn't totally one dimensional, i guess it's conceptually a little reminiscent of Falling Down or Taxi Driver, but there are so many monotonous scenes of the guy contorting his face from all the little sounds that bother him, and all it leads up to is a contextless anticlimactic murder when a suicide would have made a lot more sense."
4,Very good album,"This album when I first listened to it took me on kind of a roller coaster. When you first listen you think its very poetic and deep and as you listen it might even sound like it has that generic emo sound in their voice. There is no screaming in this album don't get confused because not all emo is screaming. anyways as you listen, there are only 2 songs or so I would say sound a little generic, but the rest you will listen to and realize it is a very well put together album. These guys will be big, maybe not overnight, but they'll get there because this album is good and they will only get better."
5,Great,Loved this single. one of my fav. songs on The Open Door. Weight of the World from Tokyo was awsome as well.
5,I buy it! totally worth it!,"I just can't belive this dream come true...i bought an inexpensive copy of this amazing single!This is the best single/video from their last cd The Open Door...The Artwork is just AMAZING! their best ""album"" cover, with Evanescence's best members untill now.5/5The first track is the beatiful and explosive Sweet Sacrifice. 5/5The second (and the last track) is Weight of the World from Tokyo (another execellente song from TOD). You can find this peformance in video too on internet, but here the audio is in an unbelievable better quality. 5/5Overall: 5/5Recomended to Evanescence's single collectors."
3,paul hogan is the best,paul hogan is awsome i love him in crocadile dundee's this movie is not as good as them but it is a paul hogan movie.
4,I like this movie.,"Good movie to see if you are a Paul Hogan or Linda Kozlowskifan. It is also one of those movies a viewer should seetwice, because the first time you don't know what is reallygoing on. Don't miss the ending, all is explained. I give itfour stars - not one of the best movies around, but one of myown personal favorites."
1,"Makes ""Sister Act 2"" look like a classic! Awful!!","Paul Hogan is utterly lost away from the persona of the ""Crocodile Dundee"" movies and his Foster ads. This cringe-worthy excuse for a comedy with an appalling script that attempts and fails to make religion funny is among the worst films of recent years. Souped up with bad performances and wince inducing sentimentality, this is a disaster. ""Feel sick"" rather than ""feel good"", Charlton Heston's cameo as God adds some much needed charm."
5,Great for everybody,"This movie is funny, uplifting and one that I enjoy watching over and over. It is right up there with Michael."
2,Package,"I ordered this radiator using data from car's VIN and operator manual, and the Amazon web site identified the correct model number. The item arrived on time, but upon removal of the old radiator, the new item did not match the old radiator. The fitting for the ECT temperature probe was missing at the bottom inside of the new radiator. I verified the correct item was ordered at the web site and had to return the item, which was done by Amazon at no charge. Thankfully, the local auto parts store had the correct item in stock to complete the repair on the same day. It appears the wrong product was packaged in the box by the vendor. The model number on the Amazon shipping box matched the model number from the local auto parts store box. Bottom line: compare the old radiator with the new one before you start your repair job. It is difficult to see this ECT temperature probe fitting when installed, so look closely."
5,Perfect Fit,"Part came in right on time,Just as it stated, also it was an exact fit on 00 Camry didnt have to bend are alter anything. It was easy to install took about 1 hour,If you want to re-use your anitfreez then remove the skid plate, its 10 10mm bolts that hold it on, remove and place container under and loosen the drain valve it will save you the cost of replacing anitfreez which will not wear out unless it gets oil in it. if you dont want to save antifreez, you dont have to remove skid plate but it makes a real big mess."
5,Death Expert Loves Traces,"I love the five video set and am glad to see that it's available as a collectors set. Please contact me with any questions.I am knowledgeable about embalming, autopsy and shock videos and am happy to share information. There are bootlegged Traces out there so you want to be careful, contact me before you purchase Traces."
1,TRACES OF DEATH,"First off, I had to take a half day off so that I could be home to SIGN for it, so that in itself was costly and an inconvenience. When I finally made an attempt to watch this video, it was of such POOR quality that I was not even able to view it. This doesn't even qualify for 1 star!"
2,So troublesome,"I like the style of shoes but It really troublesome for me. It get dirty so quick and hard to clean it. If I knew about it, I wouldn't buy it. the color of black trim will come out so easyly when it touch with water. After that, it makes the leather dirty and so hard to clean it.Just dont wear it when it is raining. Any way, I hate to clean it everytime."
3,Blueprint 2 not as good as expected! Still it got some heat!,"Jigga is back with the sequel after his last year classic ""The Blueprint"". The first Blueprint was the best Jay-Z record since Resonable Doubt. Pure hip-hop in a party form!! Im loving this Jay-formula! Blueprint 2 is a double cd, and I think Jigga overated himself abit with this release thinkin he could drop two discs.. The album ends up with too many fillers! It would be better to gather the best 13 tracks of these two discs and make it one cd instead! I ain't sayin this album is bad, but compared to Blueprint 1, this is not as good as you expected! I expected alot more! Still this cd got some really good tracks. The best are: ""The Watcher 2"" feat. Dre, Truth Hurts & Rakim, ""Blueprint 2"", ""03 Bonnie & Clyde"" feat Beyonce, ""Diamond is forever"", ""I did it my way"", ""A Dream"" and ""The Bounce"". Disc 1 is fo sho the best disc!"
3,He is so talented when he puts in the work . . .,"And this is why he shouldn't be biting other people's songs. Hey, Jay, everybody respects your lyricism. The original Blueprint was supreme. Now you've made a double album with enough songs to make a great single album.I started to bob my head to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and then went back to listen to Tupac's ""Me and My Girlfriend."" I recommend this. Recognize that when a talented rapper remakes a great song, you're going to like it.Now listen to ""Heart of the City."" Listen to ""Imaginary Player"" and ""Can't Knock the Hustle."" Check out ""Guns and Roses."" Hear what Jay can do at his best, and write your congressperson. We deserve better."
4,Its Hovi Baby !,"This new joint from Jigga is off the chain . At first hear I knew I wouldn't be let down . This 2 disc album is some of Jay's best work . Personally I like disc 2 better but disc 1 is hot . This album features apperances by Beyonce,Twista,Big Boi of Outkast,Killer Mike,Sean Paul,Lenny Kravitz,Dr.Dre,Rakim,Face, and his Rocafella Fam .My favorites on Disc 1 are : A Dream,which features Biggie rappin his verses from Juicy, The Watcher 2 featuring Dr. Dre Rakim and Truth Hurts,What They Gonna Do with Sean Paul,Poppin Tags with Big Boi Twista and Killer Mike is the best on disc 1 . And Disc 2 is just ill . Every track is Dope . The Rocs newest addition MOP lay it down on U Dont Know the Remix .My favorite track is Blueprint 2 . He rips my man Nas on this one . So if want some ill lyrics,Tight beats and if you like the ROC this is your album . Keep droppin these hot records Hov ! Peace."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"I am a huge Jay-Z fan...and I must admit his reign is over. BP2 is the cd that has proven he has nothing to rap about anymore and he has let his bragging and ego overcome the cleaverness he clearly displayed on Reasonable Doubt. It is a shame, but go back listen to Reasonable Doubt and BP1 and appreciate him in the form he should be appreciated, at the top of his game."
2,not the same,"This is a good cd. but jay z could have done better and is expected more than this. It is nothing like the blueprint one. He really doesn't dog anybody like he did in the first one. He seams like he wants to bring the older styles of music back. There are a lot of features on this cd. songs featured with m.o.p., dre and scarface are the best songs on this cd. next time i hope he gets back to hova not hovi."
1,Used to obtain the gift now he's just cursed...,"I didn't even bother to cop this joint, why? As soon as I heard the Tupac sample but even worse the same melody and what not, I was like Ehhhhhh WACK! This is like how Ashanti took credit for Scarfaces ""Mary"" sample and flipped it to ""Baby"". What a lack of creativity. And this entire album is a big frustrating disappointment of SAMPLES, SAMPLES AND SAMPLES!!! What happened to originality? This is for the birds and kids...Simply wack, save your money people. Purchase THE ROOTS ~ Phrenology instead or some Bob Marley.I really rated this CD NO stars but in order to follow through with the review I had to give this wack sh!t 1. Blah!"
1,Gay-Z is biz-ack,"Same Jigga [garbage]. This has nothing new. Their is one joint I like on the whole two cd set. He hasn't had a good lp since ""Reasonable Doubt"". If you like watered down rap,with no possitive message, this is the album for you"
3,really a 2.5,Jay-z is tight and all but this cd was no good i bought it because i like bonnie and clyde but there's only bout 2 other good songs on this cd. For da people dat like club style music i wouldnt get this.
3,The curse,"Now dont get me wrong, jay is a great rapper but this aint his best at all. In the editor i cant believe he compared it to pacs all eyes on me, well it aint even close. Its got a couple of hot tracks but i think jay shoulda just dropped one hot album instead of 2 aight ones. No cd by him yet tops his first, reasonable doubt"
4,Jay brought it,This CD Was good- I need more time to really get into it- I always will thiNK resonable doubt is the best CD ever from Jay- But This Blueprint 2 has a lot of hot appearance on it w/ hot producers- I like ALL the Neptunes tracks and Timbo tracks- Kanye did his thing too- I think the CD was hot so get it and feel this man.................................. Kel froM the CHI
1,A talented rapper he said,I really liked the way he rhymed:.....he said.....he said......I did.....he said.....was said......I said......He said......was dead......he said......he said..... I said......I saidHe's very obviously a talented rapper.
2,Back to the Drawing Board,"This is by far the worst cd Jay-z has put out. I have been a fan of Jigga since I heard Who Ya With on In My Lifetime Vol.1. This cd is a great dissapointment.Instead of being called the Gift and the Curse Jay should have just called it the Curse. The single Me and My girlfriend was great when Tupac did it on Makaveli. Jay-Z needs to check himself and the yes men who told him that this double cd was worth putting out. No matter what is said you will hear the entire double cd on the radio and everyone will be saying how great it is. This is why Jay-Z will put anything out no matter how bad it is like ""Song Cry"". If you really are a fan of Jay-Z please let him know that true fans will not stand for this."
4,Jay shows us how...,"Everybody knows that Jay Z is one of the most influential and successful rappers of all time. Like 2Pac, Biggie, Nas and Scarface he managed to create more than one classic! But just imagine Jay Z had released a CD called Diamond Is Forever with the following tracklisting:1. Diamond Is Forever2. A Dream3. The Watcher 24. Bonnie & Clyde 034. Guns & Roses5. U Don't Know (Remix)6. Meet The Parents7. Some How Some Way8. Some People Hate9. Blueprint10.Excuse me Miss11.Poppin' Tags12.F**k All Nite13.The Bounce14.I Did It My Way15.A Ballad Fo The Fallen SoldierWell, I think it could've been another classic. I guess Jay Z wanted to be up there with Biggie and Pac, creating a double cd classic, but unfortunately it's not a classic... It's just plain, good rap. Keep up the good work Jay Z!My Jay Z album chart:1.Reasonable Doubt2.In My Lifetime Vol.13.The Blueprint4.In My Lifetime Vol.25.The Blueprint26.The Dynasty7.In My Lifetime Vol.3"
1,Jay-z doesn't have the gift on this album he has the curse,"I like Jay-z even thought i think Nas is better Jay-z made some classics hes hot but this album he fell off on this one i like him hes one of the greastest besides Nas,Biggie and pac Jigga is that N***a but he was weak on this one If you listen to Jay-z or not pick up these albums Reasonable dought,In my lifetime vol.1,Vol.2 Hard knock life and Blueprint those the albums i got into by Jay-z peace."
2,Blueprint 2,"Just like Dalton Higgins said on the Amazon[.com] Review ""...not even Jay can tear through 11 hot tracks, much less 25"", he was so right. There are a couple good songs, but there are alot of annoying tracks on The Blueprint 2: Gift & The Curse. I don't agree one bit when ppl are calling it the hip hop ""White Album"". Thats a stupid reference. It really isnt anything that special."
1,Fellow Jigga fans...,"If u think u think BP2 is going to be a classic like Reasonable Doubt, u are sadly mistaken. After I listened to this cd, I ran to the used cd store to sell it as fast as possible. I said ""Excuse Me Miss"" Can I sell you this cd, I dont know how too. I'll ""Show u how"" she said back to me. So I sold it for 6 bucks, not bad i guess, but to tell u the truth this is a very bad cd, i guess ""Some people Hate""."
1,"Thats 3 wack albums, every 1 year average!!","Blueprint 2 is horrible!! Its all filler tracks. One good song on the whole album!! He doesnt spit any bit of possitivity in his songs, and in general, is a bad lp compared to the Reasonable Doubt. Enough said."
1,Jay Z needs to Quit Rap... Nas murders Jay once again!,"Jay Z's new album Blueprint 2 is his lamest effort yet. The guy has talent. He is a great rapper. But this effort is pathetic. There isn't one track that is memorable in any way. He falls way off here. He rips off everyone from Tupac to Biggie. He relies on guest appearances. The beats are lame. The album is way too long and drags big time. Nas's new album, God's Son, is far superior. Nas truly has proved he is a better rapper than Jay Z. Jay Z needs to step down. After this pathetic effort, he is not the king of New York."
1,No More Jay Z,"The song that really makes me mad is his Bonnie & Clyde remake. Everyone knows 2pac didn't like Jay Z (it's in his lyrics). Not only does he steal some of the exact lyrics, but he uses an almost identical beat. When I first heard it on the radio I couldn't believe it; I had to change the station. Honestly, I like some of his songs so I'm not trying to hate on him. This album isn't even hip-hop. It's commercial rap. He rushes to make an album so he can make the money, plain and simple. No more Jay Z for me, back to the 2pac and true hip hop that I love."
1,Jay Z a.k.a. Photocopy machine,"Ppl call him the King Of New York for being a Xerox copy of Biggie and Jaz-0. Come on, even Nas's new cd better than this. Listen to some real hiphop everybody. Their is only like one hot joint, on the second disc, thats it."
2,More Cursed than Gifted.,"Jay-Z, or as he likes to call himself the ""Jay-hova"" of hip-hop, defintely seemed to be in a runt on this album. Personally, not many hip-hop acts have been able to complete a good double-album. And Jay follows right in the epithome of that cliche.The first disc is tiresome and grows painfully dull, you'll find yourself skipping thru alot of tracks here.The second disc, the better of the two, is laden with samples from old-school jazz music does some help for musical diversity and shows the Jay's versatile side. But remember the phrase...""Too much of one thing is a bad thing""...and that pretty explains why you might be yawning while listening to it. Although it does give a refreshing sound to the whole neptune-esque like production that has been flooding the market for the past few years.Another reason i dont really care for this cd is, all the biggie smalls/tupac references and quoting. ... and its very annoyning. Its still an ok cd, but i wouldnt waste the money for it."
1,wack,"two discs and only 4 great songs, i guess all that love he got from the overrated blueprint gassed him up, jigga try harder next time and maybe you can have something as good as god's son, or quality."
4,It's Classic Jay-Z,"For those who say this album doesn't have direction are left behind in the new trend in music. J. Timberlake is making music with Timbaland. Christina Aguilera stole a Redman song. So when Jay-Z put Frank Sinatra on a track what's different (which that song is hot)? The Crossing of genres has been big lately (mostly R&B/Hip-Hop). On this album Jay did that, plus a little more. He always goes over the top, and he's going to bring a new formula to every CD. That's why Jay-Z is so successful, and other comparable artists (artist not rappers) aren't. The thing I wish he wouldn't do (and only did this on one CD) so much is feature other artists. It waters his albums down."
3,MEDEOKRE,JAY-Z HITS US WITH SOME OF HIS FINEST TRACKS...AND SOME OF HIS WORST. THIS CD HAS THE SAME TYPE OF SONGS OVER AND OVER WITH DIFFERENT BEATS AND LYRICS... IT STARTS OFF GOOD ON THE FIRST CD WHICH I WOULD GIVE A 5/5 TO BUT THE SECOND D SLOWS DOWN AFTER A SONG OR TWO BRINGIN THIS CD DOWN INTO THE GUTTER!! NICE TRY JAY-Z WITH THA DOUBLE CD DEAL BUT STICK WITH ONE GOOD ONE NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF HITTIN US UP WITH A GREAT ONE AND A PIECE OF [...]!!!
1,Applause for Jigga please,"Lets all hail Jay-Z because he has made another bad cd. Each time he makes a cd he sounds more and more like a stupid pop artist. He sounds more like Nelly and Ja Rule on his BP2 especially that corny ""Me and My Girlfriend"" remake. Jay lays down more BS than any other artist out there today. I dont see how Jay-Z can hate on anyone but himself for this cd. He is almost as bad as P.diddy. Anyone who buys this cd is wasting their money, they should be doing something much better with their money like...treating a few of their friends to some Micky D's, buying a couple porn mags, or buying any other cd in the whole entire world."
2,"The Gift & The Curse? Well, he's half right!","I used to have a lot of respect for Jay-Z. I thought he was the most clever and cocky MC on the face of the earth. his first three albums,in particular Reasonable Doubt and my personal favorite Hard Knock Life Vol. 2 are some of hip hop's shining moments; it's some of the most creative and commercially oriented hip hop of all time. But since Vol.3, the quality of his music has gone down hill horribly, relying on putting teeth marks on the penises of dead legends(2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G) and putting out TRL and 106 & Park tailored junk. But of course,if I was ""shagging"" Beyonce Knowles on the regular basis, I wouldn't be worried about my music either!(How that relationship happened is a mystery reserved for the Twilight Zone, isn't it?!)"
2,'H to the OMO',"i cant deny jigga got some nice flows when he put his mind to it, but given that he got real potential just makes this album even more wack. If you expecting hot tracks like ""jigga - whats my motherf-in name>"", ""its a hard knock life"" or ""h to the izzo"" you not gonna find it here. Instead he just biting mad styles from all the great rappers, he steals half that tupac song 'me and my girlfriend,' he spitting biggie verses like he was the one that wrote them. this album is weak, dont even cop a bootleg; just because he reps marcy dont mean he didnt sell out. Lyrics on this album is meaningless, radio-friendly hip hop about buying clothes and f-ckin."
2,What the?!?!?!,"Wait a minute? Haven't I heard all of these songs before? Oh yea, thats right! Half of these songs are rewritten and poorly done so if i can say so myself. The ""hit single"" from the album, 02 Bonnie and Clyde is a rewrite of Tupac's ""Me and my Girlfriend."" ... In only Pac were still alive......."
2,Garbage!!!!,"2 thumbs down!!! Jay-Z has turned into a biter! No Ideas Original! He recites other rappers lyrics like UGK, B.I.G., Tupac and Nas on his album like a fan would of his/her favorite artist from a song stuck in their head. Hes a fan a phony a fake!I will call this album a tribute to all the emcees that he loves."
5,Wow!,What an incredible album. Jay-Z has outdone himself with the Blueprint part 2. There are so many great songs on this album. Everybody should cop this...
2,THIS ALBUM IS LAME,"It's obvious that Jay-Z doesn't have to rap to eat these days, which gives you more reasons to keep your money and stay away from this weak album (check the original BLUEPRINT OF HIP-HOP BY BDP - 1989.) The sad thing about Jay-Z's Blueprint 2 is that it could have been a good albun had Jay-z put out some of the best songs into one CD. His egos tell him that he has to follow in the footsteps of Biggie and Tupac. By releasing a double CD album, he thought he would leave a legacy - he didn't. There are, however, some good songs on the blueprint and almost all are on one disc, the black one (my girl let me old a copy...)It's sad to see Jay going out like that"
4,LOVE IT.,LOVE THE 2003 BONNIE AND CLYDE SONG. I THINK THAT IT AS A GOOD PROJECT WITH THE SONG WITH U IF ANYONE DONT HAVE IT THEN THEY SHOULD GO AND GET IT.
3,fyi,"The sampling (""The Ectasy of Gold"") for Blueprint2 is straight outta ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Clint Eastwood in a great scene. Morricone was a helluva composer for westerns, a surprise to see it end up on hovi's list. Must've gotten the idea listening to Metallica's S&M, Disc2. I agree, some of these tracks were over the top arrogant. One disc would've been enough."
3,jay-z takes a step back,"this was almost as bad as volume 3. It seems like jay just put everything together to produce a double album instead of just picking the good stuff he had and making a single album. There are some hot tracks on this cd, The Bounce being the best. I think jay should team up with timbaland and create a cd, that would be hot!!"
2,Jay-Z Number 1 fan with honest opinions,"I heard it was WACK and I bought it anyway; I am a die-hard Jay-Z fan...and will always be...even when he does a rushed, not-so-good album like Blueprint 2. Blueprint 1 was a CLASSIC....heavy rotation and great hits. Blueprint 2 fell way short. But he redeems himself beautifully with the Black Album - another classic!!"
1,save your cash,"There is one good song in the CD. The rest sounds like it was recorded in a piece of [junk] studio in jay's basement. I used to like this guy, but making a CD this bad should be against the law!!"
1,"All Filler, No Killer!!","Man, I have never liked Jay Z. His whole style is bit off of three people. His creator Jaz-0 (yeah, i know, the name), and the great Biggie and Pac. I wont lie. Reasonable Doubt, and the Blueprint were pretty good albums, especially RD, but this album sounds like he put it together in a day. First off?,There are no real 'stand out track's' on this album, its all typical Hova filler and why are you biting Pac for your lead single?, you arent and never will be Pac. And Lenny Kravitz?? Does anyone still like him? And going after Nas again? damn, you will never be better than him, the only reason you went at him was to help your dieing career, which, after listening to this double lp, didnt work."
2,Wack,"What more is there to say about this cd. Its all filler tracks, only like two good songs on btoh cd's. And that joint with Lenny Kravitz is horrible. Jigga should of just had a one disc album instead of two, I might of then gave him a 2 1/2 rating. Lates"
4,J-HOVA!,"The Blueprint2 double-CD will definitely be a treat for the Jay-Z fan. Although Jay-Z's lyrical flow is not up to par with the Blueprint1, this album will definitely go Platinum with its radio friendly & bangin' club beat tracks! There's at least 10 good tracks, but I won't go into detail and just let you figure them out when you pick-up your copy. For those of you who think the album is WHACK..you're just a bunch of ""HATERS""! Regardless of what you think (which is insignificant anyway) I will say that there's something on the album for everyone...even a remix of the hot track in BP1 U Don't Know w/ M.O.P. for the thug in you!Just because NAS made ""one"" popular song (I won't even call it hot), trying to diss J-HOVA, people now admire and worship him talking about he's the best rapper since Biggie & 2Pac! The audacity! Where has NAS been for the past ten years?!?! That's right...no where on the MAP! I think LL Cool J (The G.O.A.T.) is waaaayyy better than NAS! HAHA..now that's a WRAP!!"
3,Not that great,"I only like ""Hovi Baby,"" ""'03 Bonnie And Clyde"" with Beyonce Knowles, ""Excuse Me Miss"" with Pharrell Williams, and ""Poppin' Tags"" with Big Boi, Killer Mike, and Twista. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money on it."
3,haven't heard it,"i hate jay-z. but i will admit he is the best. please people get off pac. i love the fact he made the pac remake to clown. what better ways to disgrace you enemy than to take his music and sell it. everytime an albums sells jay-z know he beat pac. Nas is a sell out. jay-z's plan is starting to have motion (what is his plan?). to show everybody else they are stupid. jay-z can put out good or bad, it sells. take old pac (everyone knows about the fued) and start some contriversy (it sells). take another rapper (nas), and use him to sell records (they but albums just to hear what he is going to say). jay-z: the best ever, unstoppable (til they kill him like he did pac)"
1,UGLY MUSIC AND UGLY MAN.,"Another fine example of how horrible today's music scene really is.I dont understand why so many people support everything that this clown puts out.After looking at the front cover artwork is it any wonder why he called this the curse.If you want music with simple beats and a man who just keeps going on about how rich he is,then buy this filth.If you want original and quality music then check out led zepplin,black sabbath,iron maiden or sepultura.By the way,it must of took him hours of mental work to come up with that front cover.ha ha ha.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS HORSEFACE!!!"
1,Jay-Z a.k.a Photocopy Machine,"Ppl call him the King Of New York for being a Xerox copy of his 'mentors' Biggie and Jaz-0. Come on, even Ja Rule's new cd better than this. Listen to some real hiphop everybody. Their is only like one hot joint, on the second disc, thats it. The ""King Of New York"" is ""OVA!"". Brooklyns worst rapper. Period."
2,Biggie or Jay?,"I will admit I am a Jay-Z fan, however I am tired of his referencing and stealing Biggie's rhymes on every CD. Please come up with some original material. I really think it's time for Jay to take a break from the game for a minute."
5,2 albums of pure flames,Okay. This album was an experiment. It is very good . Of course there are some fillers. Every double album has it. But check out 2.1 which is the best of Blueprint 2. He should have just made 1 disc like 2.1. Would have been classic.
2,Response to Samuel Weissman,"The comment from Biggie that was used in ""A Dream"" (""blow up like the World Trade"") referred to another explosion that happened in the World Trade Center in 1993. However, the term, ""World Trade"", is blocked out so as to not offend people whose family and friends died in the other World Trade Center explosion in 2001.This album is pretty subpar; some hot songs (""Meet the Parents""), a lot of weak songs (""F**k All Nite"", ""2 Many H**s""). Should have been one disc instead of two. The Black Album is better."
3,Jay-Z maintains but doesn't progress.,"I automatically buy Jay-Z as soon as he drops, without even hearing any of the tracks, but maybe from now on I'll have to witness tracks before hand. He's still got it (this is his 5th straight album to debut at No.1 on billboard) but like so many X2 CDs, Jay can't keep to his expected high standards over 25 tracks. It would have been a very good album if he had selectively just included 12 tracks, but as it is, there's just too much track skipping. I feel that the different styles and ill word play that he had on his first 3 albums have disappeared of late and there is not enough of the ""God damn, he's nice"" factor in this album. It's still worth getting though. I give it 3 stars. Jay-Z's finest work is still Reasonable Doubt and Hardknock."
1,THE WORST ALBUM EVER !!,"If any rap fans out there want to know what a commerciallyStraight-Wack album is, this is the one you need to take note of. Now I'm a Jay-Z fan No doubt, but come on now how are you going to CREATE! the BLUEPRINT, which was the best rap album OF THE YEAR. It was so good I bought the UNPLUG version also, But this GARBAGE BP2 is striaght WACK Jay is trying to get paid off this album and he will cause after what he did on the first one we got ALL hyped and gased and thought he was going to get busy again ... Hell nahh he ran out of lyrics on this one, if you don't beleive me just listen to 'EXCUSE ME MISS' & ' HOVI BABY' my god it's wack ........Reminds me of that Garbage Noreaga brought out for his 2nd album"
1,25 Tracks-4 Worth Playing,"I blindly bought this album w/o listening to it first-needless to say, that was [$$] I could've spent elsewhere. Of all the tracks, the only ones worth playing are the tracks with featured artist. '03 Bonnie & Clyde is a bad attempt at Jay-Z trying to gain from Tupac's fame. I can't believe he had Tupac in the video like they were friends-Tupac ate him up lyrically and despised him as a person. Jay Z needs to stop saying he's better than B.I.G. and that he's the greatest of all time. Jay-you can't compare with Outkast, Scareface, or Pac-you're barely keeping Nas from making you look stupid."
1,Jay-Z fan Lost,"This is the worst album I've heard all year, and I'm pretty sure that he's playing this can't be the real Blueprint 2 I've heard all this nose about. I'm a big Jay-Z fan and if I was able to not give it any stars I would though the second disk was better then the first it still falls short of Jay-Z quality I think Nelly can make a better double CD the driest album of the year"
2,Retirement is a good idea,"Yo, if this is what Jay has to offer from now on, the it's about time to hit the door. I remember the Jay-Z I used to love...the hungry Jay, whose rhymes were quick, intellectual, and clever. His first album personifies pure talent. Classy and suave but not blatantly ""bling"". Add some years and a couple mil, and this is what you get...half-baked raps that probably had Jigga yawning in the booth. And why two discs? Sounds like ole boy was running out of things to say. I used to dig Lenny Kravitz until I peeped Guns and Roses. Bet they came up with the idea to collaborate while in Spa, drinking Cris and scoping models. If this record was cut in half, I would have given it an extra star!"
2,Way too overated,"i wasn't at all happy with the new Jay-Z, except for a couple of songs like Poppin' Tags and The Watcher 2, which were both really good and those alone gave this record it's 2-star rating. i thought that Jay tried way too damn hard to fuel his own ego and try to create his own genre or rap, if that's what he was trying to do, because if that's not what he did then i don't know what the hell he's doing."
2,Hova needs to take a break,"I have listen to many-a rap album by J, and I have honestly liked all of them. But I feel that releasing an album every year has taken it's toll. this album is in one word 'Poor'. in particular the second CD (the curse) has absolutely no good tracks on it. even the bonus traks just don't help the albums cause. But on the other hand disc1 (the gift) is slightly better, especially the 'the watcher2' with Dre, rakim & truth hurts! that is a true Jay-Z track, it's is reminicent of 'can I get a...' on the Hard knock life album. the 'bonnie & clide' track with beyonce is catchy but far too comercial for a rap album. jay-z seems to be trying to emulate Biggie in this album, and in doing so ruins what makes Jay-Z great. It seems that Jay-Z is far too concerned about earning some money for Roca-fella than making a true rap album for his fans!"
2,Sub-standard jigga material,"Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with this record, after coming off the stellar Blueprint, I was expecting and classic but was surprised when this album didn't meet my expectations. The album seems very rushed and packed with alot of filler songs. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple hot tracks and would have been better if they released it as a single CD. I would not recommend buying this and instead pick up the new Talib Kwele Quality or Tupac Better Dayz."
4,Good but not Great,"Jay Z is one of the best rappers today and he proves it with this album. The first song on the cd ""Dream"", his duet with the late Notorious B.I.G. is by far my favorite. It tells the story of Jay Z dreaming of Biggie and then telling his dream to someone. It takes you back to the good ol days when it was all a dream, and we used to read Word Up! Magazine. One of the disapoining things on this album was the work by the Neptunes. The Neptunes usually produce my favorite songs, but on this album, they are the worst. Maybe if they did more then 3 songs on the cd, it would have been better. Jay Z needed more layed back songs, instead of the dancing beats that are mostly on this album. The original Blueprint had the laid back songs that make you reflect and think. Jay Z is one of the best lyricists and he could have shown it more on this album then he did. For the most part, I love listening to this album. No matter what I say about this album, Jay Z is still the greatist MC today."
1,Jay-Z comes up WAY short!,"I'm not normally the type to write online reviews, but I want to forewarn everyone out there to stay away from this CD. Jay-Z is one of my favorite artists, and Blueprint (Volume 1) was absolutely fantastic. Blueprint 2, however, leaves you skipping through tracks looking for SOMETHING to hold on to. The rhymes are weak, the production is shoddy, and there's really nothing original or appealing about either one of the two CD's. Jay-Z should have spent some time putting thought in to his next move, because this makes him look like an amateur hoping to ride on the coattails of his previous album's success. Stay away -- it's not worth the [money]."
3,Brick Layer,This album was wax. It diserved 3 Mic's on The Source. Nas the King of N.Y. Look 4 God's Son.
1,The Truth,"first off, being a Nas fan i cant see that jay-z has been all that great. This album has came out too fast, if he would hide and actually write lyrics! the songs can be improved. but sadly to say beyonc`e has saved this album, if she didnt go out with him, i dont think anyone would buy this. but peace to 2-pac and get nas- God's Son!!!! november 17 2002"
2,Jay-z has fallen off!,"Last year I heard the orginial blueprint. It was an excellent album: good lyrics, tight beats and signature hooks that made him jay-z, but now jay-z has fallen off! He doesn't rhyme anymore, his beats are not as good and his songs are corny. I like bits and pieces of the album...but overall it's average."
2,tried to like but................,"Well this album is horrible. At fist i was excited about the whole hype, But then when i got it i was trying to like it but then i got disapointed. I think im going to have to sleep on his next album because This is just bad, I could of rated it lower but i did like some song from it. overal the thing im sayin is save your because its not worth it. I recommend you to get the nas album GOD's SON. To me, it waay better and you wont have to listening to jay-z trying to beat nas(which he wont). But if your a DIE HARD jay-z fan then get it if your not then dont get it because it will make you hate him."
3,some bright moments...but sub-par for jay,"like someone else said, had several tracks been edited-out, this CD would have be a much better product. half of the tracks sound like he was playing around in the studio, or freestyling during a radio station interview. they sound rushed, or like he was recording them in his 22nd hour of being in the studio.ahhh, but the tracks that work. they're all 3:30 of bliss. overall, however, it's mediocre for jay-z."
5,JIGGA IS A RAP GIANT,"SINCE THE DAYS OF TUPAC ALL EYES ON ME AND BIGGIE LAST GEM LIFE AFTER DEATH MASTERING A DOUBLE DISC IS NOT CHILDS PLAY U HAVE TO BE ON YA GAME TO MAKE A SMASH WITH A DOUBLE CD.ENTER JAY-Z AKA YOUNG HOVA BIG HOMEY FROM THE R.O.C.WELL YALL GET IT THE MAN IS IN THE ZONE MIKE JORDAN OF RAP OUTSIDE JAY WORKING BLUEPRINT TWO IS A MASTERPIECE TRACKS LIKE ""ALL AROUND THE WORLD""IS BEAUTIFUL ""WHAT THEY GONNA DO"" IS A CLUB-BANGER THE REMIX IS G-CODE ALSO.MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS ""GUNS-N-ROSES"" AND ""U DONT KNOW"" PLUS HOVI BABY AND EXCUSE ME MISS THESE SONGS ARE SHARP LIKE WOLFVERINE CLAWS PLUS THE LYRICS ARE AMAZING SO FOLKS LISTEN TO THE CD DONT JUST SKIM THRU IT.PS.EVEN A GARBAGE CAN GETS A STAKE"
1,Can't Complete,"Jay-Z can't compete anymore. He [is a bad] song writer. If youv noticed, almost all da tracks on dis album r remixes of some sort. Tha sad thing is none of the remixes r better than da originals. Da ONLY Tru MC on the entire Eastcoast is Nas. Jay-Z is trying to hard to compete wit Nas and is puttin out [bad stuff]. This is the first Double-CD dat Def Jamz has put out and it is a failure."
4,Stop Hatin' Nas Fans,"The people that gave this CD one star are Nas fans that won't give anything else a chance. Sure, Nas makes classic CDs, including the best CD of 2002 ""The Lost Tapes"" but that's not a good reason to hate a CD. BP2 is a great CD, with many classic songs like ""A Dream"" ""Hovi Baby"" ""Watcher 2"" and ""Poppin Tags"" from disc 1 and ""Diamond Is Forever"" ""U Dont Know Remix"" ""Meet The Parents"" and ""As One"" from disc 2. There are some horrible songs like ""03 Bonnie and Clyde"" the sorriest excuse for a rap song ever and the Neptunes' ""Excuse Me Miss"", but this is overall a great album and better than the so-so ""God's Son"" which in my opinion is Nas's worst CD and a huge disappointment after owning every other one of his CD's."
2,CRAPTACULAR,"This is almost as bad as his ""Volume 3"". Their is like two listenable joints on the whole cd. My little brother could of done better production on this album that even the Neptunes, who had below-average beats on their part. Kanye West did a good job on the boards, and so did Just Blaze. Overall though, this is a bad album, with nothing but Jigga's obsession with cars, jewlery, and belvedere (whoops! I meant Armadale! foolish me)"
4,jay-z is the greatest,jay-z is the greatest the only reason why i gave this a 4 instead of 5 because the neptunes production is wack and he also killed nas on Blueprint 2.Nas is tight but Jay is the illest and whoever said reasonable doubt is the only tight jay album can go to hell
1,1hit song,"This album [stinks] hard,he just an sorry artist period.He just a clone of Biggie he needs to get out of his shell for real,Jay-Z is to laid back,he is sorry fa real,people up north give him to much props he is not tha best rapper,its plenty of rappers that spit harder than that [junk],Like Ludacris,Outkast,3-6 Mafia,Trick Daddy,Project Pat,Nas,Jada,just to name a few.This man is highly over rated.The album only had 1 good song and that is poppin tags,if he didnt have twista and killer Mike plus Big Boi this would have been an ok song they out shined him on his own material.Thats tha only highlight of tha album tha rest of tha album is garbage for real.Keyword Dont Get This [junk] Save Your Money"
1,i love jaz- z,this cd sound just like every other rap cd i have bought for the past five years. so if you like hearing songs with the same subject as every other cd out there you should pick this one up quick
1,BP 2 The G&C,"Warning: Sick of commercial, over produced, lying, fake peices of garbage?? Than this isnt the album for you. Joints on this album make u think to yourself ""People call this guy a GREAT lyricist??"" Come on, he bites Biggie's style on every song, and all the songs sound the same, with no diversity!! What happened to hip hop?? If its not Bling Bling, Its guns guns, everyone needs to wake up, and understand that we are in this giant corporate bubble sucking all of us in to this world of coca cola arm tatoos and disney world cup holders. Wake up!! Before it takes everything you own, and digs into your soul."
4,PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN 2 MUSIC,"People trashin' this album don't know lyrics when they here it. Every track J blessed with his lyrical talent. Tellin' me not 1 hot track i name like 13 of the top of the head. 1. a dream, 2. hovi baby 3. the watcher 4. 03 bonnie and clyde 5. the one with sean paul (not really sure of the title) 6.been around the world 07. guns n roses 08 u don't know remix 09 meet the parents 10 blueprint 2 11 nigga please 12 as 1 13 the last track not counting the bonuses neither. So if some said that 1 song is lyin' just like that it's not his best work cus he added tracks that shouldn't ve there like the last 2 on the gift. He as"
2,Typical Lay Z,how this Cat still gets all this Attention&whatnot is beyond me.His Flow is tired&His Beats are standard by the Numbers.He found Lenny Kravitz&probably should have done a whole disc with him.He will have a Decent Greatest Hits Disc someday but His Albums are very Few Hit&a ton of Miss.
2,IF U CANT HONESTLY RELATE TO RAP STOP LISTENIN TO IT,"i just wanna say i think its funny that all these reviews seem to be from a white audience, claimin stuff like ""jay z is the greatest"" uhm, by far his ... ISNT the best. the cd is aight, but it aint all that. i mean, if mainstream, overproduced,made in its entirety to target suburban white america rap is what u like..... then ya i can see where ud think this album is THAT tight and Jay z is THAT good a rapper.......... u want real rap go buy reasonable doubt........ not this garbage --- dj 6"
2,Disappointing,"Taking into account all of Jay-Z's previous efforts, this double album was a double disappointment. He needs to come up with a new formula...he's just become content with finding different ways to tell the same old stories over sampled beats. Originality is lacking. Now I see why it's 2 for the price of 1."
1,That's not right....,I have to be honest...I am a Jay-Z fan. I generally support and love his material. But in these hard economic times it is down right criminal to put out a double CD filled with filler and charge your fans for it. Jay as a fan I'm telling you...man that's not right...that' not right.For those of you who want to support an artist who has earned his keep please check out 2 Pac's Better Dayz (R.I.P.).It's a nice piece of work.Shame on you Jigga...you owe me $7 bucks...I got $6 back when I sold this Cd back to the store.
2,Just download it,"If Jay Z keeps putting out garbage like this album I will never purchase again. I downloaded CD off of Kazza to preview before I buy.. wow what a horrible collection of songs. There are a few good cuts on the second album, but other than that this was a major dissapointment. I have since deleted all songs from my hard drive."
1,Still Awful,"Now my friends told me to go out and buy this cd because they told me that it was better then his last few efforts, but I have to disagree. Jay needs to go back to the style of ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""In My Lifetime...Vol. 1"". Every cd he has put out since his first two have been totally wack and I don't understand how anyone can like that stuff. He has no business dissing Nas now because he has no consistancy to his music. If it was 8 years ago this would be a good rap war but Jay is not what he used to be."
3,Everything I expected,"I heard most of the album last week off of the internet and it seems to be OK. I like Jay z and everything but he needs to come original. In this album he is taking beats and rhymes out of the mouth of 2PAC!!! Overall the album is good, you know, you can dance to it,"
3,High quality R&B/Hip Hop/Pop,"jay-z is apealing to a lot of musical taste. will be very popular because it is pop music. not great for one of the 3 best MC's ever (biggie, jay-z and nas). if you liked best of both worlds you will like this album. great production if you like r&b mixed with hip hop. couple of songs he flows to his potential. MOP comes off. lots of club bangers. lots of videos will come from this. very little grime. not for wu-tang / mob deep / lox fans. dre/rakim/jay song is very good."
4,Its hot,"Definitely one of the better double albums to come out in recent memory. His flow is better than Blueprint and theres a total of 25 songs on the whole album. Whats impressive is the lack of straight up bad songs. Most double albums have at least 3 or 4 tracks per CD which just suck to the point where you hit the fast foward button but I counted just two on the entire album. The rest of solid tracks if not hot to death (Blueprint 2, Some people hate). Definitely worth the money. I wish he would drop all the guest artists like he did on the first blueprint though. Rakim and Scarface are always welcomed but the presence of the other Rocafella artists detract from what would otherwise be great tracks. Is it just me, or is Sean Paul's voice just really annoying?"
4,Jay Z all grown up!,"I can honestly say 2Pac is one of my favorite rappers of all-time, but Jay Z is a rapper I can say is showing us that he is a rappers with many styles, and has grown the hell up. Reasonable doubt(classic) is my joint, but follow me here. If I have done something like Jay has done and did it well. Why make a album like the rest? Excuse me mis, Blue print2, and a few other cuts can hit the radio to sell records. He works hard not to put out the same sound on each album. If you have ever been in a studio to record you will understand. Creativity ain't easy! Try it. I like the new joint he is getting his Grown Man On! Holla."
1,Fan Lost,"This is a big disappointment I have all Jay-Z CD's and this is the worst album I've heard from Jay or Nelly for that matter ""hint, hint"" he used several 2Pac Lyrics and Beats I thought Hip-Hop was suppose to be creative this album lacks Lyrical content, Creativeness, and Production Jay we need for you to get your head out your a** and give us the classic music we're use to holla"
2,mediocre,"Dissapointing..... Jayz could do much better???? TO much mediocre [stuff] on the first cd.... not enough songs on the 2nd cd to save the album..... Jayz is rushing and flooding the market with mediocre stuff.... The album if filled with weird gospel sounding samples. The title track ""Blueprint 2"" is simply the best song on the cd period, Lyrically and production wise. The watcher is good too. Howerver the rest of the cd is subpar...."
1,the weakest link,"This album is so weak, the only tracks that are worth listening to for me are Watcher 2, Blueprint 2 and Bonnie & Clyde 03.... But I even think that that song is weak because how can you take the selfproclaimed ""new king of NY"" seriously if he copies the title from Eminem and the hook, backgroundmusic and even the effects used on the hook from 2Pac/Makaveli... He must have a problem with his originality, because after quoting Biggie on nearly every song on his last album, now he starts doing that with the other dead poet... Let them rest in peace and get off their d!(ks...To me, with this album Jay-Z is hiphops weakest link for this year.... far far away from Reasonable Doubt, his best album by far.."
5,Masterful,"The Blueprint 2-The Gift and the Curse, is one of Jay Z's most complete albums to date. The production from Kanye West, Just Blaze, Dr. Dre, and the Neptunes is great. Jay Z's flow and wordplay are unparalled by anybody in the entire rap industry. There is no wonder why this albums sales are dwarfing those put up by Nas. Jay Z is everything Nas wants to be. Buy this album and avoid Nas' latest weak effort. You will not be disappointed."
2,h to the no mo,"jay is a good rapper,when it comes to talking about materialism,money and women,but when it comes to true hip hop,he's a diamondand a outfit too short,he shows no true concern about hip hop,other than dead presidents which has nas's voice,that is the only true hip hop song he made,the bp2 is a half album the curseis ok but the gift is just that and we all know nothing is freeand what you get from the gift is nothing,a bunch of thoughtlessgarbage,i don't understand how a rapper who talks about bulls--t can say he is better than a mc who keeps it real and uses true wisdom and poetry to make masterpiece music can fall so hard,youyou said nas fell but his worst album is better than this crapgood thing jay is retiring he's not even in the same galaxyas nas,nas is lightyears ahead of jigga,party people and booty shakers for jigga and true uplifted wise hip hop heads for nas."
4,who?,"are you a fan of jay-z? i wasn't. i normally couldn't find more than 2 songs on any one of his cd's that i liked but i liked what he did on the ""8 mile cd"" so when i found the blueprint2 cd on sale at target, i decided to give it a listen. man, i liked atleast 80% of the cd.it is gonna be hard for him to top #3 the watcher2 with dr.dre, rakim, and truth hurts. this cd is worth the money."
4,1 of Hova's best!!!,This album is one of Jay's best in a long time. Both CD's are good but 2 is better. He has a lot of songs with artists like Dre and Big Boi. The joint with Face is pretty tight too. All around it is a very good album.
4,Yup Yup,Jay Z is layin it down again. In summary the top song of this cd is poppin tags! If you don't have this cd yet you must get it!
3,The Curse better than The Gift,"Blueprint 2 is a good album but the second disc is far better than the first. The first disc is kind of weak, maybe because its the first thing I listened to by him after ""The Blueprint"". There are a couple of good tracks on the first disc mainly: ""A Dream"", ""Watcher 2"", ""Poppin Tags"". The rest of Disc One seems to be filler. Disc Two is good from start to finish. Each song has pretty good beats and it seems to be the more focused disc lyrically. Anyway if you like Jigga then you should get it you won't be dissapointed. If you're on the fence about getting this listen to it first. I gave it 3 stars because like I mentioned earlier the first disc is very weak."
3,Not bad - but its no (St)illmatic!,"Jay-Z is a brilliant rapper, no doubt about it. But the problem is, for all his vocal talent and superb beats (especially a great one from the neptunes), his songs continually suffer from the lack of the lyrical genius that legends such as Tupac, Biggie and Nas (to some extent) possess. I aint sayin he cant write, but if he cud just improve his lyrics, the title of king of rap surely would be his, but, as it is, this album sadly lags behind such greats as Stillmatic, Illmatic, and all the Tupac and Biggie albums. Another problem is that it has been seen that no rapper, no matter how great he is, can keep up his quality over 25 tracks. Shawn Carter just burns out after the 1st 15, leaving 10 wasted tracks. Overall this is a good album, once again displaying Jay's superb talent, but lyrics let him down a bit."
3,Not one of his best efforts.,"I think that this could have a whole lot better album if more effort would have been put into the lyrics. Clearly not better than BP1, but i don't think he really cared because he knows that people will buy his sh#t anyway. thats too bad. Another album that this and i'll be burning it."
1,Disappointment,"This album really doesn't even deserve a star. It is truely a disappointment, a word that is starting to describe Jay Z's musical talent. He must really need money or something because I wouldnt release this unless I had a dire need to get some cash, cash that will have been taken from DISAPPOINTED MUSIC FANS! Jay Z should be banned from releasing albums after this pityful display of music"
2,"Blueprint 1 was hot, what happened???",This album is nothing but trash. Sure there may be a couple of hot songs but the fact of the matter is that Jigga aint Jigga no more
1,.9 stars,"theres a few good songs, but most of its trash...he needs to make a album street, hes makin em popdont buy unless you like guys like nelly and ja rule"
2,Not as good as BP1,"The cd is mainly filler, with a few good songs, mainly on the second disc. The Amazon review was right, Jay should of known not to put out a double cd, which hasnt created any classic from any artist(2pac's is arguable). The production is good, especially Kanye West, but the lyrics themselves are below-average for 'Hov, and has typical material-like shoutouts (Count how many times he says 'Armadale Vodka'), and are sprinkled with many references to cars, hoes and .44s"
1,JAY-Z DOES IT AGAIN,"ONCE AGAIN SEAN CARTER USES THE SAME FORMULA CASH, WOMEN, AND CARS. JAY-Z IS AN EXTENDED TREND THAT WILL GO POP RIGHT ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER COMMERCIALIZED POP RAPPERS."
1,Blueprint Who?!?!?,"Like an idiot I rushed out to buy the new Jay Z CD, Blueprint 2. I have never been so disappointed in a CD in my life. I'm in the process of wrapping this CD back up and seeing if I can get my money back, if not, I'll send it back to Roc-a-Fella Records because this is just horrible. It seems that he was trying too hard by using other people's rhymes and having a million folks collab with him but it missed terribly. Jigga, what were you thinking?!?!? To all those that are thinking about buying this, borrow it from a friend, listen to MAYBE one good song and save your money."
2,What Happened Jay???,"I used to enjoy buying Jay-Z's albums but the last 3 have been disappointing.. First ""The Dinasty"", then ""Blueprint"", now this one.. I'm not sure if he's lost his edge or what; But this CD is not what I expected from Jay-Z.. I'm disappointed that only a few songs on the Double CD are worth playing in my car on a daily basis.. Unfortunatly he will sell a lot of units because he is Jay-Z, but he will have alot of disappointed fans.. For those of you that are disappointed in this CD, you might want to try out the New Canibus CD ""Mic Club"" or Fat Joe's CD. I highly recommend them.."
2,Jigga's Losin' It,"I've always been a pretty faithful fan to Jigga but this album was a dissapointment, it lacked originality and good lyricism. You can easily tell this double CD was written in two months, which is sad. He should spend time listening to his old material, especially REASONABLE DOUBT, which I feel was his only ""GREAT"" album. I disagree with MUSIC FAN, there have been several classic double cds in hip hop history. How so easily you forget Biggie's Life After Death and 2Pac's All Eyez On Me. Those double cds were classics that changed Hip hop forever, Jay-Z falls far from those superior quality rap artists.And not to make it a Nas-Jay beef but you should take a look at Nas' God's Son. Many say it is a slow moving and boring album but i believe it is a different side of Nas that has deep lyrical meaning, something that Jay-Z never shows. It's true his lyrical content is mundane and boring, always about money, hoes and clothes. Jay-Z is not considered Rap King in my book...."
4,"Hot, but not the best","Hey, the album is hot, but not the hottest I've heard from Jay Z, I must say as a follow up to Blueprint 1, it's not as hot as I expected but there are some really hot tracks on there, and 2 or 3 that should have been cut out of the album, but it's good, i don't think I wasted my money on it. Holla. ""Hovi's Home"""
4,The untouchable,"I don't understand how closed minded some people can be.I personally think this album is hot! because he takes this album in many different directions. I don't think jigga was trying to make his greatest album, he is just showing us the many different flows that he has. There is something for everyone on this album. The tracks that he did with the neptunes is crazy!! thats my personal favorite. We also can't forget about""meet the parents"" and ""somehow someway"". I just don't get it, but jigga let the haters know with ""some people hate"". HE RIPPEDthat track. This cd certainly may have to grow on some people, but for me I think it is a classic. I'll SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS SON! keep killin them Jhova"
2,Blueprint 2,"Compared to Blueprint 1, BP2: The Gift and the Curse is weak. There are a few good songs, but the bad ones outweigh the good ones. I guess if you are a big Jigga fan, you will like the Gift and Curse, but other hiphop fans, should look elsewhere."
2,King of NY?,"After listening to the cd, its hard to imagine that he still calls himself The King, after two horrible cds (Best of Both Worlds and BP 2). Here are my nomintations for the REAL king of NY: Biggie, Rakim, Kool G Rap, Jadakiss, Nas, Styles P, Busta Rhymes and Big Pun. Who do you think?"
4,Hov's 7th album.,Well Jay-z's new album ain't his best work comparing to some of his albums like THE BLUEPRINT 1 and THE DYNASTY. He is one of the greatest MC's ever but he can do betta than what he did on this album. I think the battle between him and Nas should end because I think it's makin' Hov' lose concentration. After the beef everybody in this game is against him and you can hear that on the track BLUEPRINT2. If he ends this beef thing we will listen to the greatest MC from THE ROC.
4,2 of my favorite all time songs the rest is ok at best,these two songs are amazing the rest can be looked over...but if u dont have these two songs in ur collection get them now....Diamond is forever-amazingblueprint 2-amazing
3,There's a great ten track classic in there,"If you took some of the best songs from this album such as Meet the Parents, Blueprint 2, etc. and made a cd with them. It would most likely be as good as the Black Album if not the original blueprint. There is way too much filler in this for me to recommend buying it but if you're a true Jay z fan you'll enjoy the jewels scattered throughout the two discs."
3,too many tracks,maybe a 2-disc cd wasnt good for jay-z. its better that he made blueprint 2.1 and cut the tracks in half. the promotion probably wasnt as big as the black album but its still an ok cd. just too many tracks. even jay-z calls blueprint 2-gift/curse one of his weakest albums because it had too many tracks.
2,Blueprint 2: One Huge Curse,"I just want to know what happened between September 2001 and now that has made Jay-z release this .... I have to admit that this was to be my ""gotta-have"" album of the year, but I'm sadly disappointed by the lack of playability. Don't be too excited with the fact that this is a double cd. I found myself many times hearing the same old song about the opposite sex. I was also disappointed by the beatmakers for the album. Just Blaze is always a pleaser, but Timbaland I would expect more from. The Neptunes are getting a little to artsy with their selections for beats lately as is, but c'mon fellas. Anyway, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. A few songs may tickle your fancy. Loved the MOP collaboration. Good thing this cd is inexpensive because I would not have wanted to spend more than 20 dollars on this GahhBage."
2,Misguided,"Jay Z's attempt to please all turns out to be a disappointment to his original fan base! This album is plagued with cliches, samples, and the use of other artists lines & hooks. However some will give this album rave reviews just because it is Jay Z, although this is by far one of his worst albums to date. Material from the late Biggie Smalls appears on several songs and Jay Z flaunts it as if it is his own. Lyrical content is seldomly removed from the same I have this and I have that. This is a sad day in Hip Hop when one who is considered to be at the top of his game puts out a double CD with watered down content and exploits the game that he claims to be so credible in. Jay Z frequently glorifies his former involement in the drug game and pocket book snatching yet makes a song saying Somehow Someway we going to get of the ghetto one day! What a positive influence to the youth!"
1,jay z = bad,"Look, there isn't an adjective to describe how horid Jay Z is. Don't buy this or any another Jay Z album. '03 Bonnie & Clyde is such a cheap ripoff of Pac's work which is what 90% of these mainstream rappers do nowadays. Ripoff the greatest. If you really enjoy rap, then stop listenin' to these mainstreamers who are ruining what hip hop was and will be remembered as."
3,"Packed with Information, Riddled with Typos and Omissions","I have been using this text in a wastewater engineering course. It covers the different aspects of wastewater engineering well, providing in depth treatments of each. However, the great size of this book (over 1800 pages) may also be its weakness, making it an unmanageable project for the editors.In one month of usage, I have found serious gaps in the problems. Many cross-references are incorrect, and there are some problems which omit values required for solution.In short, this is a good source of information. With closer editing, it could be better."
4,"Good book, poor support","Metcalf and Eddy's Wastewater Engineering series is always good, but new editions of any book seem to have mistakes in the examples. The one that's bugging me ( it's the only one I've tried so far) is Example 4-10, concerning the time required to absorb a gas. The book gets a V value of 10; I get 1200. There's obviously something that needs explaining here, but I've been unable to get any help from either Metcalf & Eddy or McGraw Hill. My e-mails don't seem to get to anyone who can help, or they're being ignored.It seems to be a good book, but if you have any questions you're on your own."
5,More about aerators,"For years I had use the aspiration aereators (mechanical aerators) and it really surprise me that in this book does not show any technical data, just 3 lines in a paragraph, how does the engineers can include these equipments in their designs?"
5,Great Reference,"This is the International version. It is great and has both SI and English units. I have not compared it to the hard cover, but this one is great - well worth the money (and savings)."
4,Interesting Book,This book is well written and relatively easy to read. It has proved to be very helpful in my Biological Principles of Environmental Engineering Class.
2,Soggy Political Drama,"True Colors stars John Cusack and James Spader as law school buddies on very different career trajectories. Spader plans on going into the Department of Justice and resigns himself to serving the public. Cusack, on the other hand, is an extremely ambitious politician. I bet you can tell where this situation is headed! Despite their differences, they remain friends, even after Cusack steals Spader's girlfriend from him.The movie tries to examine issues of power and corruption. Unfortunately, the plot is so stale and obvious that it fails to add anything new to this arena. Spader and Cusack are fine, but Imogen Stubbs, as the woman they both love, is terrible. She's a Brit playing an American, but her accent creeps in far too often, which is a huge distraction. I'm a big fan of John Cusack, but this movie is definitely one of his lesser accomplishments."
4,True Colors,"A decent although not perfect yuppie-themed political drama. Good focus on the impact of social & economic status in the arena of government. For those who like John Cusack, see my review(November 13, 2007) of ""City Hall."""
3,Good but flawed,"This film played an important niche role in falling in love with a past girlfriend. We both were working in a branch of the political government then, and government remains our life. While this film has some serious flaws with plot and character development, it is to persons such as ourselves to whom the word politics is a synonym for beautiful, a film that must be seen. Parts are perfect. Parts are totally wrong. As a whole, it is amusing, and a perfect way to spend a sunny fall afternoon with your girlfriend on her couch. Long live the Republic."
4,Boat Rod Holder,I have used these before on my kayak and will install 4 of these on my fishing boat.....they work very well
2,Don't believe the list price,"This RCA balun has a list price of $75.99; very misleading. It looks like something you would by off the rack at K-mart for about $4.99 at most. It's packaged in a rack hanging blister pack. Don't expect much; cheap Chinese built product with a old trusted brand name.Attached it to a home built antenna and the spade clip ends came off, ended up soldering them to my connectors. The Coax connection was typical of a cheap product and did not feel like it really connected well. It was worth the $2.50 with free shipping but don't expect a higher quality product because of the list price."
2,Junk,"Really cheaply made and flimsy. Barely works. Will not last very long, might disintegrate when you hook it up. Better off finding an older one if you can."
2,Not a fan,I bought this for my son because he heard his friends talking about Thomas. He was not a fan when he finally saw it only because the characters don't really move around and it does get annoying to listen to after a couple times.
3,r.d. Laing,IT was ok excpet for the book itself. It was printed on cheap paper with a bad font. That would be ok if you had just mentioned it.
2,Could be much better,"I understand this topic and I have read this book. I have rated Knots two stars, my estimate is that the author could have done vastly better."
1,Psycho Babble,"The pretentiousness of this book is in a word AMAZING. If you can make it through the whole thing you'll be left with a feeling of ""where did my last 3 hours go and how do I get a return on my time invested"".DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RAG!"
3,You may see yourself in it.,"It's prose that has a similar structure to poetry in some cases, and logic puzzles in others. They mostly describe patterns and habits of thought that interfere with happiness and relationships. You may recognize some that apply to yourself."
5,"Book is remarkable, but check your shipper","This book is unique unto itself. Poetic interaction from within our reactive child. Assumption patterns. Some are my favorite poems/theories. Have ordered copies for a few friends. Some new are fresh, some new are the old poor quality paper and come very browned. My original copy (30+ years old)is starting to crumble. What will the new one I order look like?"
2,Painful Reading,"Painful because of the subject matter, and painful because of Laing's style or pretension towards one.If you want to find out about Laing, read his earlier stuff first. This is not Laing at his best, this is the threadbare, ideologially-exhausted Laing. By the point in his life that he wrote this, his time had definitely been."
2,Just didn't like it,"I usually really like books written by V.C. Andrews, however, this book was the exception. I liked the rest of the series but not this one. The other girls in the series were believable but Cat's story was too crazy. I just didn't like it. This could have been a nice end to this series but it's content is not suitable for unmature teens."
4,The Best Book in the Wildflower Series,This book was the best one out ofthe Wildflowers. But it was really predictable like the other personsaid. Oh well i can oly say this though none of these books r as good as the 1st 2 series!
3,Not as bad as it could be,"The fourth installment to the Wildflowers series is by far better than the previous three. By reading the previous three books, you get subtle foreshadowing on what Cat's story is. Cat seems to be the one with the most traumatizing story out of the four. The whole book is somewhat...predictable but is still good. There is a small twist in the end and I'm eager to see what ""Into the Garden"" has in store. Maybe it's Doctor Marlowes' story? Who knows. It'll never compare to the Dollanganger stories and such but maybe they'll get better."
3,Better than the rest,"I read Cat's book last nite. If you thought the other 3 had problems, wait until you read Cat's book. I won't say what happens, because it all ties together in the book. This book is somewhat better than the rest, maybe because I've waited to read Cat's story ever since Star's book. Can't wait for the super edition of the Wildflowers."
1,this book was the worst,i've read all her books but this series was the absolute worst. i think the team of writers should go back to v c andrews' old writing style. i really enjoyed her old books like flowers in the attic and melody. basically all the books before the orphans and wildflowers series were the best.please publish and write better and longer books of more substance.
3,Predictable,"There was a hint in the first 3 books about what Cat's story would be about; if you didn't catch it there you certainly will at the beginning of the book. This book was MUCH better than the other three, but by no means the VC Andrews we are all hoping for. It's still more of a teen-age book than adult. I can't help but feel INTO THE GARDEN won't be so good...What will the girls get together and rehash their same problems all over again? This was by far the worst series."
1,Dried Flowers,Sadly this is the worst series in the VCAndrews collection. The story dragged on and I lost interest in the first 3 chapters. I agree with the other customer that the ghost writer should either be replaced or return to the original writing style. The Flowers in the Attic series & the Heaven series were the best and will always remain among my favorite books. The single star is a single star too many for this book.
3,A Young Adult Book,"I thought that this book was an ok read. It was nothing wonderful. It was more like something you read just because it happens to be right in front of you like reading a magazine in the check-out line. It is a V.C. Andrews book, so anyone reading this review knows that the book can't be that bad. My viewpoint is probably like this because I am so used to reading her novels that when I began to read this miniseries I started to miss all those detailed descriptions that the miniseries lacks. Also, I wouldn't place this book in the Adult fiction section of the library; it belongs in young adult. The story content is adult but the style is definetly young adult."
3,Best of the Wildflower books,"There were several things I didn't like about Cat. I'm not sure why such an emphasis was placed on her precocious puberty or her weight. Her family story is interesting, and felt the most VCA-ish out of all four girls. She has a neurotic mom and a loving daddy... a very loving one. She trusts him so much that she doesn't quite realize his feelings for her until he final;ly betrays her. This story should have been a full novel, it had the potential to be fleshed out into a compelling tale, perhaps even a full series of its own (with the revelations from 'Into the Garden'.I would have given a higher rating, but Neiderman's writing had declined in quality since the Logan series, and while this story was interesting, parts of it were rather flat and contrived."
4,Fascinating,"Before Helen Keller, there was Laura Bridgeman, the first blind and deaf girl who learned not just to spell out words for objects, but to actually learn a language, to write in sentences not just in braille but to also put her thoughts down on paper with a pen. This biography of her life, how she was taught, her family and their challenges with a child who lost her sight and hearing as a result of scarlet fever, and her relationship with Dr Samuel Howe, the man who 'rescued' her and made her his lifelong project.The biography is based on letters she wrote to friends and family,the journals she kept, and from letters written by Dr Samuel Howe and some of her teachers.It's a fascinating insight into a remarkable woman who should not be forgotten."
5,"Ah ,the whole story!","Great read packed with info. I've always wanted to know more about her, not just the vague references made in books about Keller and Sullivan."
1,Bitter,"This book has too bitter a spirit for me and seems more directed to women who have a sour relationship with their mother; or are not happy being a mother themselves and trying to deal with that. I cannot see how it is helpful or how it even fits into a mother/daughter help category; it seems to be Nancy Friday's personal tale of how her mother failed her and she is trying to explain why everybody else Must Also be Screwed Up and Unhappy. How is this book constructive and helpful? Not for me. Try something else, really."
2,I've read better...,"This book was written for women, as such men will come away feeling that women are ""really screwed up"" about thier mothers, and while it does attempt to explain certian things, you do get the feeling that the author wants somebody to blame for the things that have gone wrong in her life... One wonders what her mother though on reading it, if she ever has.Personally I think ""Our Mother's Daughters"" by Judith Arcana (published by The Women's Press) is a far better book, a far better read for men too, especially if you want to understand the woman your mother is, rather than the woman you would have her be.I love my mother, I read her copies of both books, her mother is now dead, it took her a lifetime to deal with the pain, don't waste yours doing the same. Forgive and forget, we are only human after all."
5,My Mother/MySelf,"My doctor had suggested that I read this book. I couldn't find it in our Library, so decided to look in amazon.Yes, I have just started reading and it is quite informative....do have to read on.....My only question is ! Why was the original cost of the book $2.50 and I had to purchase for $4.53? Condition was used and sold by a recycling company????? The other 3 books that I purchased by this author: Nancy Friday are ok.Please advise.I will write a new review when I complete reading the book.Thank you.Patricia Ann Horvath"
1,SQ,"SQ bigtime! Gotta love Twittering.Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it"
2,Very subjective view,"Whilst this book does raise some interesting issues it keeps coming back to the author's sexual disfunction, all of which is the result of the mother! The author has selected professionals to back up her view rather than giving a more objective picture of her past and therefore our pasts. Problems with sexuality are so prolific in the US that I can see why so many women rave about this book. However for those of us who are not screwed up about sex chose another book. It is also a great shame that after goodness knows how many years and how many books this lady has still not dealt with her issues."
4,Great stretches,"I'd been having consistent pain in my leg/hip joint as well as some in the hip that was particularly troublesome at night so it really disturbed my sleep. Doctors, chiropractors, and trigger point therapy only helped for about a week and then it would all start again. I did these exercises and within a few days there was a difference and in about 2 weeks no pain on one side and little pain on the other. Her stretches target deep muscles that typical stretches don't address. You don't have to do all the stretches. I just do the ones that started out as painful and tight. The cd explains things well but the cd is hard to maneuver; it doesn't return to menu when you push the menu button for some reason. Nonetheless, the stretches are really valuable. I've ordered her other cds just because I want to limber up my upper and lower back."
5,keep lower back pain at bay,Mary Smithson Hutto helped me years ago with occasional lower back pain by providing instruction on how to stretch to make the pain go away. The DVD explains these stretches with out having to travel to Maui every time you need it!I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone with mild to high back pain as it will make your day vastly better.AlohaFrederic Berg
3,sexy women,Well the movie is good with clear sound effects and romance. The Director has made the movie so exciting that it has to be watched to give the feeling.
4,Worthy reading.,"Written in the days where one could point out another's flaw or deceit and not be labeled a looney\racist. Clearly a intelligent man, I'm glad his work can still be enjoyed and educated by all people who want to understand what they see on a day to day basis in world affairs on a higher and less known level."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!,"[...]Anyway, all I can say -- if freedom of speech exists -- is that this is an excellent book. It reflects reality as it is today, and it was written in the early 19s. Everybody should read it."
3,Much to Think About!,"Given when this was written that so many of the facts became accurate predictions? Why didn't we see this coming? One look at this country today makes one wish more people would have read this book decades ago. Today, one could never have the freedom to write with such an opinion and with the loss of freedom of speech would likely be labeled. Good book and much to think about!"
3,Much maligned for its criticism of 'jews',"Not a lot of weight can be placed on this book because many other authors have done a far better job at examining and exposing the hoaxes perpatrated by the religious zealots that espouse zionism, both 'christian' and 'judaic""."
3,"Oh, Henry, you little Devil!","This book was an interesting, albeit frighting, read. Frightening because it is difficult to imagine that anyone could feel as he did about an entire race of people...of course he claims throughout the book that he is not anti-semetic, all while he is bashing ""the Jews"" (a term that he uses in the most derogatory manner). In fact I wish more Americans would read it, then maybe they would have a better understanding of what is really happening around the world when we hear the same rhetoric from other anti-semetic people and groups...Adolf was quite fond of Henry! In spite of Henry's anti-Jewish propaganda, I found the the book useful to do additional research of the era in which he lived. I used it as a ""jumping off"" point to learn more about what was happening in America, Germany and around the world during the time Henry wrote these articles. If you choose to read this book, make sure you have a bottle of Rolaids near by, because it will turn your stomach!"
1,Tsarist Propaganda that Ford later repudiated,"""The International Jew"" is Tsarist propaganda that Henry Ford himself later retracted and repudiated. http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/protocols1.html has more details on this: ""Resilient in his efforts, Brasol sent a copy of the Protocols to automobile manufacturer Henry Ford, who was convinced that they were authentic. For the next two years, Ford gave the Protocols wide circulation in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent.""Ford therefore saw material that he believed to be credible, and did the equivalent of pressing the ""Send"" key. His ""Send"" key unfortunately consisted of the Dearborn Independent, so he ended up putting his name on material that later damaged his reputation.If anybody wants to read this material, it is available for free online (e.g. at white supremacist Web sites) and there is no need to buy the book."
5,Double Light,"Put this in my rv to replace an older light that came with the unit from 1978.Excellent light output,easy as pie to hook up.Ill definitly buy more."
5,Best book to read when expecting,"Despite my best intentions I did end up with an epidural, but this book help demystify the process of labor. This book felt so much more helpful than the prenatal classes my husband and I took. I did use positions and movements described in the book until the epidural took effect after about 12 hours of labor.My one recommendation in retrospect would be to make sure that your husband/coach reads the book also. I was too discombobulated during labor to really make full use of the information."
1,stale candy!,"I'm a huge Twerpz fan, but the box of candy i received was stale and i was pretty upset with that!"
3,Cute but senseless,This is a cute book with fabulous illustrations but it just doesn't make sense. Each of the tiny short stories have no point and no meaning other than cute and fun.
4,nice little cutting board,"We were looking for a small cutting board. This one is perfect for what we want to use it for. Not made of bamboo, real hardwood instead. I oiled it when we got it so there should be no problems for a long time, hopefully."
1,Stopped Working after 2 weeks!,The left channel started going out only after 2 weeks of use. Do not buy! Terrible quality! Amazon needs to make sure the things they sell are of reasonable quality.
3,$$$ Appears to be a quality product but to expensive $$$,"Light use for about a month: If you expect it to be NON-Stick you will be disappointed: Stick Resistant Maybe! I use it with a small amount of Olive oil or Olive oil spray: Still a challenge to keep fried eggs from sticking.Good quality product, however, others of same or better quality for less money.SOOOOO! Will I purchase Sitram Cybernox products again: NO! Poor quality to price ratio-----------------------------------------Update: 8 May 2006:A little experience goes a long way: After a few weeks of frequent use: Pan lives up to its claim! With a little spray and GOOD heat control clean up is a snap!!!!!!!Will purchase more as price decreasesGIVE IT 5 STARS"
3,Okay! Not the mastepiece of Mama's Gun,"I think the cd is okay. I give Erica credit for making something fresh and new. To me it's just not lyrically want I expect from her. Of course, it's catches you with the first couple of songs. The last two tracks are not that good. Erica, is sooo talented...I just think this was something for her to do. Not a lot of effort and thought was put into this project."
3,Badu?,"This album was somewhat of a disapointment. The fact that it only has 10 songs makes it hard to bear. But Badu always deliver no matter what. Songs like The Grind, Back In the Day, Danger, Think Twice, and the hypnotic interludes of ""World Keeps Turnin'"", won't stray you away from the true genius of Erykah Badu."
4,Real Music!,"First of all, it's not about age...it's about appreciation of all music. I am 21 and I proudly embrace the true soul and funk that has influenced the contemporary hip hop we are hearing everyday. Nothing against the ""music"" that is topping the charts, but I was just awaiting something new to provide an escape from the same old sound. No surprise, Ms. Badu delivered.I have been supporting this queen since Baduizm and will hold on tight as she continues. It may not be on the level of Mama's Gun, but HELLO??! That album is on a level all by itself! I don't believe in expectations, but with each try Erykah comes with the sound I never knew I was missing. I saw her in concert in Orlando, and I cannot WAIT to see her again! Go get this EP!!Personal favorite: ""I Want You""Listen, concentrate, absorb!"
3,i'm not sure what to say...,"i must say i agree somewhat with what others have said. this album is...well confusing...i'm still trying to figure out where she is trying to take us on this album. what her exact purpose is. i'm not stunned to hear some of the things she has on here. i was very anxious for this $8.00 purchase, and don't regret it, but in some ways i could have saw myself downloading this album before purchasing it, and i wish i had. maybe with the more times i listen to the album the more i'll get into it. for now its being used as a coaster in on my computer/study desk. it will get another chance at rotation but for now...point blank i'm a fan and want to support erykah...see ya on the 11th of october in dallas!!!"
5,Erykah Has Done It Again!!!,Gets some getting used to but after the first 2 minutes I fell in love. The cd is off the hook and the thing I love about it is that it's not an 18 track cd. 10 tracks is all you need. I know most of the songs already and I bought it on saturday. Go get it!!!
2,Disappointment,What an incredible disappointment! I love Badu. The power and authority she usually sings with was missing here. This CD is boring without any complexity or excitement. I think she phoned this one in.
4,The Princess,"You gotta love Erykah Badu. She's an original and she pretty much has been writing the same songs in the same grooves her entire career. Ah...but What Songs and What a Groove!She's got a delicious voice: all black strap molasses and deep amber honey with just the right amount of Jack.Everything on ""World Wide Underground"" sounds like it was recorded at 4 AM after a night of partying, trading stories and reciting poetry...just before everyone decided to call it a night. Listen to ""Back in the Day"" or ""Bump It,"" you'll see what I mean. But before you do: light some candles, open a bottle of Jack, light a good Cuban stoogie and let the Badu woman put you in a trance of unmitigated good humor and love."
4,True Soul,"For those who say ""not much thought was put into this album"" or where was she trying to take us"" I can only say that these are probaly the same ones who think 50 Cent is what music is about. Ebadu's new cd is truly about witnessing the growth and progression of an artist..not an entertainer who concentrates on producing formulaic hits, but an artist devoted to advancing a creative tradition that she aspires to one day be a part of. Although my opinion is that with this album and Mama's Gun she has secured her place. The album is a moody experience almost a creative journey that forces you to listen and think about what you are listening to. No one mentioned how much of Chaka Khan's influence is all over the vocal phrasing..especially the way each syllable is sang like a song and stretched out as far musically as it can go. Did anyone catch that are have we been so doped up by hits that we've forgotten what music is about? Great album."
3,Can't say I liked it...,"and I have been an Erykah Badu fan since the beginning. Mama's Gun was an absolute masterpiece. When I finished listening to Worldwide Underground I actually said out loud ""is that all?""Sorry guys and girls, can't say I was wowed with this one. I understand that she is trying to make some changes to her image, which I totally respect. I view this album as a very forgiveable error.Erykah is still my very favorite artist and more original than almost anyone in the business today, but when I think about how I waited 3 years for this album I really have to think."
3,Mama Forgot Her Gun,"Coming from a true-blue E.B. fan.......she could've done a lot better. Don't get it twisted, I'm sure Erykah left commercial artists such as Ashanti and Mya's mouth watering with desire to perform like her. Worldwide Underground didn't represent Erykah's free spirit and animated abilities. I would've preferred to hear her voice belting poetic justices rather than overrated musical effects. ""Danger"" has GOT to be the hottest song of 2003-2004. She keeps it all the way real by not letting the legacy of ""Other Side of the Game"" die. E.B. showed her assets as usual. I just expected a lot more energy."
5,"Great departure, yet still familiar","Erykah is back. That's it plain and simple. You can hear influences from other artists such as Outkast within this cd and it adds a great depth that Mama's Gun, in my opinion lacked after Baduizm. Ms. Badu experiments a lot with some new and different sounds to create something unlike anything she has ever done before and also unlike what many people in the music industry are doing. Bump It ends with an awesome scat ending that's been all tripped out. The production on this cd absolutely shimmers with brilliance. Also Back in the Day (Puff) is just a great song to reminisce to while chilling out. Love of My Life mixes things up a little bit by throwing Queen Latifah into the mix and she sounds better than ever before. This cd also in rockin' the bass and has some serious funk. PICK IT UP NOW!!!"
5,A CD FOR TRUE BADU FANS!,"I was really uncertain about how I would feel about Erykah slipping a little mainstream, but after I bought her CD I totally changed my mind. This is a CD for TRUE Badu fans. After seeing her perform ""Danger"" in concert, I only wished I could have heard it one more time. And if you listen to all of the songs shes was featured in (with D'Angelo, The Roots, Guru, and others) you will hear parts of those lyrics put right into her new CD.It wasn't what I expected but much much better. It goes away from Baduism & Mama's Gun and brings Erykah into a much more 'chill' environment. With artists like Angie Stone and Queen Latifah rapping it up with Erykah, how can you really say no?This is just great. A fan for about 7 years now, I can say that I she's only getting better!"
4,...mother natural...,"sista done laid back in the experimental-cut with this yall...'sperimental like A STONE GROOVE... not 'sperimental like WTF?she channels many different influences with this, does a whole lotta hummin and scattin (not real deep with the lyrics on this album!)... heavily instrumental at times, somewhere between isaac hayes and some p-funk...this is different than what you might expect from an ashanti or mary j. blige or somethin... but come on now... we talkin bout the lovely ms. wright, yall know how she gets down! and tho this may not be the instant classic that her other releases are, this is waaay better than the regular r&b gracing the airwaves now...this is a beautifully created conception... dont be shook.dirty."
3,Hurray for E. Badu,"My hand is raised up in the air for Ms. Badu - an artist in every true sense of the word. We follow you througout your career, with each self-reinvention... ""Worldwide..."" is merely another half-step towards a new Erykah. Half-step, of course, referring to the shorter-than-anticipated length of this new project. As a more devoted fan, I couldn't help but wince through some of the more uncomfortable, lyrical moments. Yet the freedom she expresses somehow floats me through."
2,Music or Noise?,"I love Erykah Badu, but Worldwide Underground will in all likelihood go down (hopefully) as the worst CD this consummate artist ever released. In a word -- it pretty much sucks!Hopefully, Erykah hasn't blown up to the point that she believes we'll buy her music -- no matter what. Can you tell I'm really, really disappointed in this release? So, save your money and borrow a copy from another unfortunate soul who spent hard-earned money if you want to ""listen"" to Worldwide Underground."
1,1 good song doesn't make a good CD,"What happened to the rich quality of Erykah's voice? Seems she bumbles along a lot on the new CD and doesn't ever explore her whole vocal range. The only good song was Danger, where she belts out her lyrics over a very nice track. It's hard to believe that we've gone from beautiful songs like ""see you next lifetime"" to what we have on this album. Maybe she's experiencing writers block?"
2,The Feel seems to be lacking.,This is an array of songs but the hip hop seems trite and the background music too passe in the rest of the CD. The vocals are interesting to listen to once but just don't draw me in. I read a review on this an was drawn here. I don't hear what they did.
1,If ya going to do a long song...,"I love Badu first of all, but this album is good if you are under as much influence as erikah was. Issac Hayes and the jammers back then had long songs but it wasn't just an idea. It was fleshed out. This is underground? No Nina Cherry is underground, black rock and roll is underground. This album is garbage. I wished she pushed herself out of this neo soul idea and created a sound. When she did the rock thing at the end of I Want You, I got excited. But it faded. What she was about to do but cut off was underground. SHe was about to bring Hendrix, Grace Jones, Mayfield, Miles, Mingus and Bad Brains back, but she punked out. Oh well, I'll wait til someone is brave enough to be different."
1,disappointed buyer,"When Erykah said she was having a bad case of writer's block while doing this album, she wasn't kidding. Every song was like an intro that lasted 3-4 minutes. There were hardly any verses, just hooks, every track sounds like the previous, like the whole cd is just one long song. I feel so ripped off, like Erykah wanted to make a quick fifteen bucks off me for an empty cd case."
2,"Erykah, you let me down...","I am a huge Erykah Badu fans, so when I heard that she was comming out with a CD, I picked it up. I should have put it back down.....If you are going to buy a Erykah Badu CD, pick up her first one ""Baduizm""... That's all you need..."
4,Just An Appetizer,"First of all, in reading some of the other reviews it seems like most folks aren't grasping that 'WorldWide Underground' is only an EP. Hence the short length (8 tracks) and low price.Creatively it's a bit of a departure for Ms. Wright but make no bones about it, 'WU' is unmistakably a Badu joint. Besides, if I have to hear the overexposed Ashanti or the charisma-less Lumidee one more time, I'm going to eat my computer. Anything from Erykah is a breath of fresh air, luckily this time around that breath contains moments of pure brilliance.I was tempted, at first, to say ""Danger"" may be her best song ever. Well, that may not be accurate but you ain't never heard anything like this from her before. And after bumping it several times, I couldn't think of any artist who could even pull ""Danger"" off.'WorldWide' underground is a very tasty appetizer until the next proper Erykah album. Heck, I'd say at the least it's enough to hold us over for a week until the new OutKast album drops."
4,Erykah gets more and more creative,"This is a project that will only be appreciated by people who are not searching for ""radio-friendly"" music. Many folks liked her first album the best. I personally like Mama's Gun the best. This new CD sounds like an underground mix-tape and is quite clever. It is a very enjoyable listen. I like that she is willing try different concepts and expand her horizons. I wish the album were longer.I'm going to make a bold statement:This album will probably be enjoyed by people who are sophisticated music listeners."
4,"A true soul ""Jam Band"" EP...","I think all the people who are calling this EP whack are listening to it with the wrong expectations. It's not supposed to be some commercial/radio-friendly album; it's all about the art of creating ""real"" music. I love this album; it's like a Phish/Widespread Panic album for the soul genre. So much awesome experimentation and forays into different types of music (jazz, hip-hop, old-school soul, new-school beats, electronica, rock, etc.) and Ms. Badu never sounded better. Her topics are wonderful, with songs for partying and for thinking. I love ""Bump It"", the ""Love of My Life"" remix and ""Back in the Day (Puff)"" the best. Don't listen to the haters; go get it if you appreciate ""real"" music and people jamming out!"
5,Turn it up!,Wow. She did it again. This CD brings that Badu energy that she if famous for. Original and funky. She brings in Roy Hargrove for some of that cool jazz and laces it with her voice. Bottom Line this is a quality CD. Buy it!
3,I'm not feelin' it,"It took me a while to appreicate ""Mama's Gun,"" but eventually I grew to love it. It's one of my favorite CDs. This may be the case with ""Worldwide Underground."" It's not bad - just different. She takes some chances. The CD also doesn't ""flow"" like her other CDs. She's definitely on a different trip this time. The one big negative for me is the instrumental reminiscent of something Rush would do (""Woo""). It seemed so out of place. It's hard to describe in musical terms why this CD is not that great. If you're a dedicated fan, you should pick it up. Otherwise, stick with her other three CDs."
3,It grows on you,"I know this is officially an EP and not a full length album, but anyone who remembers vinyl LP's and cassettes, knows that albums only had 10 songs on them. They weren't 17 tracks (half of which [were bad]) like most bloated CD's today. Just because the CD can hold more music, doesn't mean you should fill all that space up.That being said, this album is more like the way the albums used to be: long enough; yet short enough and to the point. This record doesn't have the epic sweep of her last album, Mama's Gun, because it's a party album; a funk jam all the way through. She finds a way to keep the momentum going without it getting monotonous. It's not her best album, but it's fun, short and enjoyable."
1,BAD BAD BAD,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD. I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING AND ALLI CAN SAY IS THAT I'M VERY VERY VERY EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED.
1,I don't think so,"HATED IT!!!! And the funniest thing is that this comes a true Badu fan. I think the albulm was a waste of her time to make and a waste of my time to listen to. The only time your not wasting is in viewing this comment. Better luck next time Erykah......keep on and on, and on and on."
2,My Heart Is Hurting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"from utter disappointment no doubt! I have to truly be the biggest Badu fan on earth but this album really just didn't do it for me! I really, really tried to like this Cd but it just didn't work for me. I don't understand how she can come with her previous 3 and then something like this! I just knew after ""Love Of My Life"" her fans were in for something really special. With the exception of ""Danger"" the rest of the album sounds like a demo!"
1,This Sucked!!!!!,"Horrible, utterly horrible. Even though I spent $8.00 on it, I should have waited to burn it from somebody!"
2,"Cool but I wanted the original ""Love Of My Life""","When ""Mama's Gun"" first came out I was so excited because I loved the album's lead single ""Bag Lady"" that I had been hearing on the radio. When I got the album I was sorely disappointed--the version on ""Mama's Gun"" was completely different than the version on the radio. I grew to like the album version, but it didn't compare to the hit version. Fast forward a few years, and I was so looking forward to having her smash from earlier this year ""Love Of My Life"" on this album, and when I saw that it was one of the tracks I was thrilled. However, upon hearing the album I realize that the version included here is a completely different sounding song. C'mon Erykah, sure you may be trippy, alternative, and everything else, but how about being nice to your fans for once? It ain't all about you, y'know.I guess I'll have to wait for an Erykah Badu greatest hits to own the correct versions (or hit versions) of her singles. Boo."
2,I want a refund!,"I read some previews about this cd and to my amazement ....people were right! This cd was such a disappointment for me...There is next to none of lyrics mostly instruments and her chanting. I know that she is prone to switch up her style, but it's as if she's lost her voice on this one...No effort at all. I bought this bootleg for $8.00 and I want at least six of my dollars back. Don't waste your time with this one believe me when I say it is wack. Sorry Erkya...call Tyrone and ask him if you don't believe me..."
2,"A repetitous, overproduced mess","Can you put any more sound effects on a CD? I thought Janet Jackson was queen of this, but no more. Worldwide Underground loses touch with the essence of what makes Erykah Badu a truly unique talent. Even the voice I love becomes just plain noise after a while. I've listened to this CD quite a few times, and the majority of songs are overproduced with a mess of sound effects that fails to push her forward. Just because this album is different from previous efforts does not mean it's ""revolutionary."" Give me Mama's Gun any day over this."
5,AfroBadu!,"She is a classic neo-soul, afrocentric, futurist, deeva. I mean who else could have written Back In Da Day with so much clarity and inconspiciousness at the same time. Only Badu. The production is so original, definately out of the box. And then to do a classic remix of ""da bells"" with Mamadia, Angie Stone, MC LYTE and Latifah. I mean......... She is in a class by herself but still in the realm of her audience's taste and expectations.We love her."
4,Impressive,Everytime Badu gives you a new disc it from a different time in her life. With this disc you have to love her music to love this cd. If you love Erykah you will love this disc.My favorite is I Want You .
5,I love it so ...YOU BUY IT!!!!!!,"I am a music lover with an average ear. Most of the music today gets lots of play and is fairly boring to me. So, when an artist like Badu releases a song/CD I kinda look forward to the ""listening pleasure"". Mama's Gun was great!!! Worldwide is cool. I enjoy the long interludes and mixes. Badu semingly does not rest on her laurels. She always brings the creativity needed to ascend it to the next level!!!!I have enjoyed listening to this cd. She has taken it to next creative level. If you like creativity........BUY THIS CD!!!!Peace and Love"
2,Average to Pretty Good 2.5,with Badu not much has changed in terms of Her vocal or Her overall Presentation but the Music holds up more so for me than Her Voice which gets flater&flater with each passing release.I dug Her a bit at first but things have cooled off.I like the Arrangements on some of the cuts here but overall She plays it fairly safe.the Album on a whole is Average to Pretty Good on a whole to Me.
4,I'm Feelin' This,"I don't know about you, but I'm seriously feeling Erykah's new endeavor. What a talented sista.My favorites are Danger (#1 with a bullet) where she's a ride or die sista [this one alone worth the price of the CD], Bump It (yeah, I like to turn her s**t up loud), The Grind, and I Want You (OOOOooo, I'm wanting to hear this over and over). Woo was not one of my favorites, although it's a catchy little tune. I'm sick, sick, SICK of love of my life reprise, overdub, remix, all that .... over and over and over ... truly sick of it!!!! Overall, a good effort by Erykah. Well worth my $$."
4,Do Like Track 2 says and Bump It!!!,"Jazzy, Groovy and Crunk best describes this joint. Check it out!Key Tracks:Back In The DayDangerBump ItI Want YouLove of my Life"
3,Really good and really bad in spots,"Starts off grand with Badu's sleek neo-soul vibe at it's best, continuing to truly earn her pay as a vocalist unlike most singers. When she starts to indulge her hip-hop side in the second half things really take a turn for the worse though, and we go from wonderful, breathy experimental grooves to corny Timbaland-esque bangers that just feel out of place for her class. Thankfully this was just a little midterm sampler to kind of gauge things artistically for her and I am sure she figured out what stuck after that."
4,yeah erykah sghows more ofdat badiizm,my favorite song is back in the day boy that does take me back plus I also kind of dig that remake of donald byrd's think twice it was done rather nicely I dig it man all badu fans can relate to this one.
3,I'm Glad I Waited To Get This (3.5 Stars),"When ""Worldwide Underground"" came out I kept hearing about how bizarre it was. And you know what? It really is true. I don't know that Erykah was trying to do with this album, but the goodness of the music was tainted by these bizarre moments. The song that annoyed me the most was ""I Want You."" There's nothing wrong with having a song between 8-10 minutes long, but how about having an instrumental solo throughout the song instead of repetitevly chanting ""I I I I I Want Want Want Want You You You You, etc."" I thought that song would never end! ""Love of My Life Worldwide"" was somewhat enjoyable. It samples The Sequence's ""Funk You Up,"" one of my favorite Old School hip hop songs ( Angie Stone used to be a member of The Sequence). Other than that, ""World Wide Underground"" is just whatever. It's not as good as ""Baduism"" and ""Mama's Gun."" I hope Erykah's next album isn't like this one. . ."
2,Disappointing,"You have to be high to listen to this album or at least in a really good mood. It is not long enough and the although the beats are tight, the album might as well be instrumental since the words are repitive or not there at all. I am an avid Erykah Badu fan but this CD is DISAPPOINTING!!!"
2,Poor choice on my part,"I made a poor choice with that book. the book arrived in good shape but as I read it, it is not what I wanted. D. Hall"
2,Copies are too Light,Not what I am used to. From the first copy out was too light. At first I thought it was that I did not shake it up as some companies recommend. TCA had no instructions. I shook it up and it made no difference. So far I have made about 250 copies and my copies are too light on the normal setting. Setting the copy machine to a darker or even the darkest setting makes no change.I have not complained because I have used it but I am not happy with it and will not buy from this vendor again.They were a few dollars less than where I usually buy from and it was not worth it.
1,Received 2 Damaged Toner Cartridges from GoFastParts,"Filed an A-Z claim with Amazon for 2 damaged toner cartridges that were received from this vendor and returned. Amazon only partially refunded the money, deducting the vendor's restocking fees. Filed a chargeback with credit card company. Extremely dissatisfied with Amazon supposed A-Z guarantee claim process and results."
2,Bad assambled,"The item came fast, but when I opened the box and tried to putt it in the printer it asked me to pull out two tapes from the sides and when I did a lot of black ink powder poured out from it. I finally got to put it in the printer but I think I lost a lot of ink."
1,toner appears to be defective,started using the toner this week and it appears to be defective or a reject from the manufacturer. white lines appear through the printed copy in almost every printed item. very dissatisfied. i would rather pay more and get a reliable toner.
2,"Seems to work, but noisy","This is a reman from Tonerize. It's the second one I've gotten, and both have a high pitched squeal. They replaced the first one, and the replacement was ok. This second one has the same problem, but not as loud, so I haven't pursued it, but it is annoying. The first one didn't seem to last too long either, but that may have been the type of copying I was doing. On the plus side, the price is attractive, and they were pretty good about replacing the first one."
4,original canon toner,"The canon toner is the only toner one should use in a canon copier. Nothing else compares.My only suggestion is that a larger capacity cartridge be offered if it would fit.The only negative is the price, should not be more than $99 for what you get.It is almost more economical to buy a new less expensive printer to spread out the cash flow if it runs out.Just wait two months and buy a new printer."
3,Overlong?,"Once again, Holt combines proven elements to create an amusing story. The bewildered bystander is caught up in incomprehensible events. His staid world (yes, crashing his plane after a WWII dogfight is staid by comparison) turns out to be much more complex and much stranger than he could have imagined. He goes on an un-guided expedition, back and forth along the service corridors of history. All this in the context of the road tour of the greatest musician of all time - and I mean that phrase ""musician of all time"" in its most literal sense. Of course, certain agencies unspecified turn every party into a surprise party.It's ""in one door and out the other"" humor, a nice way to break up a stack of professional journals and texts. The book's one repeated joke tends to wear after a while, though, and the ending self-consciously invokes a deus ex machina. Still, I wasn't after great literature. I was after an enjoyable way to let my mind idle for a few hours, and got what I was looking for."
1,Don't buy this,"This ""glo germ"" does not work what so ever. I had to use it for a science fair project and didnt know what to do because it would do what it promised me. I think this was a waste of my and money."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I got this for our medical office to show the staff that they may not be washing their hands well enough or long enough (and to demonstrate that there are germs in places they hadn't thought about). Unfortunately, the joke was on me. It made a mess of whatever I put it on (including hands)! It has the texture of corn startch and sprinkles out like powdered sugar. It was very difficult to clean up. I used a vacuum cleaner to get the worst of it, but even using warm, soapy water and spray cleaner, it left a cruddy feel to the desk top. I would've saved my time and money on this if I had known what I was getting."
3,On second thought...,"I am actually going to revise my earlier review a bit, as I recently screened this documentary again, after doing more research on the topic. My earlier comments remain mostly valid, but I need to add a few more concerns. As another reviewer noted, the narrative of the documentary sometimes presents speculative conclusions as verified fact. Granted, the conclusions are based on some evidence, but that evidence is not always so reliable as the documentary would suggest. The annoying phrases ""most historians agree"" or ""most historians now accept"" are misleading. Historians always argue and almost never agree...especially on a topic so controversial. I guess the idea was to make the documentary seem authoritative. Watch the documentary, but don't accept everything presented without finding out more about the Alamo. I've been reading about the Alamo for over 40 years now, and the more I learn the more I am convinced that there is still much solid research that needs to be done."
4,Ambitious documentary,"Two of the other reviews so far pretty fairly rate this documentary. The inherent flaw in the documentary is probably unavoidable: it tries to cover a very complex topic from all angles and viewpoints, and this is not quite possible within the time and format restrictions. Still, it is a very good overview, especially if it inspires people to read more on the Alamo. The only other quibble I have is with some of the casting: The Travis is too old, too lean, and wears a Laurence Harvey costume. Likewise the Bowie is too old. Crockett looks good. Santa Anna is good, but doesn't look like the (mostly) Creole that he was. As for ""speculation,"" much of our information about the Alamo is just that, unfortunately. I recommend The Alamo Reader, edited by Todd Hansen, for anyone who wants to see just how ""reliable"" a lot of our source material for the Alamo is."
3,Good Coverage ... But ....,"Great job with the details of the Alamo and the scenery. However, these folks sort down-play the heroes of the Alamo. They are critical of the US Government and at one point make the claim that the US Government was no better than Santa Ana. It is all about trying to be ""politically correct."" I would have mixed feelings about showing this one to just anyone. I would not want others to think I agreed with everything stated against our heroes of the Alamo."
3,Correction,"I was contemplating purchasing this product (sorry haven't done so yet) and was reading the reviews. I have to make a comment about one. The review gives a four stars and says not to listen to the naysayers. The reviewer goes on to state that the defenders of the Alamo were rebelling against the Constitution of 1824 which is absolutely not true. Santa Anna had previously gotten rid of the constitution when he turned Mexico into a centralist dictatorship. The rebels had pledged their allegiance to the Constitution of 1824 which is why the flag has 1824 in the middle. They didn't want to rebel, but like the Americans in 1776 felt they had no choice when Santa Anna flopped sides from a federalist to a centralist."
3,The Man with the golden gun,"Very informative, but this title is a reprint under another name of Seth Kantor's earlier version, ""Who was Jack Ruby?"", published in 1978. One vital piece of information missing from both editions is Nixon's associations with Ruby, Organized Crime, Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters. In 1947, for example, Jack Rubenstein (aka Jack Ruby) was called to appear before the House Unamerican Activities Committee. A letter from Congressman Richard Nixon's office was sent to the HUAC asking that he be excused from testifying because he was working for his office on ""gevernment business"". This information was found in the FBI files after Nixon was dead and buried, I believe. There's so much more we know about Tricky Dick that was not available to author Seth Kantor at the time of his original publication. It's a disappointment that he did not seem to update this 1992 edition, but rather repackaged it under a new name. It's still a very powerful book, however."
3,just does not delve deep enough into Ruby's mind,"I have to say that I almost knew what to expect when I ordered this book.Kantor can always hold to his credit the fact that he knew Ruby before 1963 being a Dallas-ite himself.But, I feel that he scratches the surface of what could have been a really credible and cohesive piece of work, and goes no further than pointing out the failings of a handful of Dallas Police Officers.It should be called the Dallas PD's Misfeasance not the Ruby Coverup, because he just does not show any real evidence of a coverup other than as I said previously the failings or complacency of a few officers.I'd still buy the book because it is reasonably priced and Kantor does give a some thought to Ruby's movements into that Dallas PD basement which he sets out very well in the book."
2,"Needs to be remastered, hopefully in Blu-ray.","One of my favorite oldie movies, this disk is too dated and needs ehanced re-coloring and much crisper quality. I'd wait for a NEW RE-RELEASE if it ever comes."
2,Cute by vyctorynotes.blogspot.com,I found this film to be cute. It was also entertaining. I like Robert Redford and that is primarily why I saw the film.
4,"great shipping, timely prompt well packaged","better then I remembered, Redford is as cool as I have ever seen him, Winger fine job, Hannah as always fairly lame"
2,I watched it because of Debra Winger.,"""Robert Redford...got snookered badly"" in this movie? What about Debra Winger? She is too good for this film, and the behind-the-scenes friction between her and Redford are only noticeable on-screen because of him. As usual, Debra's a pro. The movie is totally mediocre, though, even for a light-weight comedy. And what's up with Daryl Hannah? I was only a kid back in the 80's, so I don't remember. Was that woman actually taken seriously?Anyhow, if you're a serious fan of any of the actors involved, you may enjoy this. Otherwise, don't do it."
5,The Eyes Only Dossier,"Any Dark Angel fan who was disappointed by the series' cancellation, this book is for you. It's told by Logan Cale, and describes all the goings-on in Seattle from the Pulse to the 2020's. Logan tracks criminals and helps friends and the book is a great journey through the Dark Angel world. I recommend it!"
2,Cross-Eyed,I really did not enjoy reading this particular book to the series. I know it was intentionally disjointed but it was still annoying. You get interested in a particular story and BOOM it stops. No ending. grrrrr . . .
4,Awesome,This leaves you with questions about the world of Dark Angel. Yet it is a great read and goes in depth making it all seem so much more real. If you like Dark Angel make sure you read this.
5,Before we knew a dynasty was in the making...,"This is the first of the Torre-era MSG Networks-produced annual season recap videos. (They also did it in 98 and 99, didn't in 2000 because of the feud between MSG and Steinbrenner's new YES network, nor in 97 nor '01 b/c they didn't win the World Series...) Al Trautwig narrates the entire season, beginning with the opening of Legends Field in Tampa, Rise of the Rookie (Derek Jeter's Rookie of the Year season), the fine year of Andy Pettitte, Doc Gooden's no-hitter, Tino Martinez stepping into Don Mattingly's shoes, and of course the nail-biting World Series versus the Braves, capped off with Wade Boggs riding the horse around the field, and the first tickertape parade in a long time! Includes interview bits with David Cone, Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Mariano Rivera, etc. with bits of play byplay by Phil Rizzuto in his last year in the broadcast booth. Unlike a World Series video, this recaps the whole season."
2,Almost intersting,"Mr. Jones is at least able to write a novel that traverses the necessary ground to give a reader a reason to believe point A could lead to point B. Unfortunately, this story requires quite a stretch of imagination for a reader to believe that anybody could be as incompetent as his main character is. While his topic is interesting, Mr. Jones does not pull it off, and that is evident after about 50 pages of reading. There's enough of a story here to keep you reading, but it ultimately fails in the same manner a ""blockbuster"" summer movie fails: it doesn't live up to its premise and ultimately makes no sense. You want the main character to succeed, to learn something, but by the story's end, you are left unsatisfied and agitated that the author didn't reflect further on how real people would act under such situations and provide some sense of insight into the difficulty of having to raise two children immediatley after the death of their mother."
3,Disappointed,"After Lucy is a fast read, but that is all it seems to be. The book seemed to have real potential at the beginning, but one quickly got the feeling that something was missing. Through out the book, one hopes that the main character will come to some kind of realization or provide insight about having to go on with his two children after losing his wife to cancer, but he never does. The most disappointing and perhaps most unbelievable part of the novel was when the main character decides to sleep with a pregnant woman he barely knows after his wife has only been dead less than a month. It gave the novel and main character little credibility, especially as he is 'supposedly' trying to face his sorrow and restart his life."
5,Superb!,"From start to finish, ""After Lucy"" is captivating. It is full of wit, feelings, and extraordinary-ordinary characters and situations that keep you turning those pages. To Daniel Jones: Thank you, thank you, thank you! To everyone else - try this book, you'll like it!"
5,Voices Sing Out,"I love these stories! Sue McGhee takes me on bittersweet journeys as mother, daughter, sister, and wife, in these literary gems. I was in the blizzard with Bird looking for her lost son, and rode on the train to Cairo with Charlie while she had a brief but unforgettable meeting wih a young soldier. I keep the book by my bedside. More nuggets of insight about the human condition are revealed with each new reading in these beautifully crafted stories. A great read!"
2,Hard to follow along,"I found the book hard to follow along. Feddema goes into all of the features of Access 2002, but only gives them a cursory glance. I found it was not enough of a treatment to fully understand the features, or how to apply them in my own circumstances. Some explanations were easy to understand, but that had more to do with the simplicity of the feature and not her explanations. The sections on VBA coding have alot of code, but no explanations as to how the code can be constructed. I found myself refering back to Access Step-by-Step many times while trying to use this book. Eventually I had to get the Access 2002 Bible.I would not recommend this book to anyone who finds the step-by-step format the most useful to follow. The CD is just a rehash of the book, so not really any more helpful either."
3,An acceptable companion volume,"Rarely will you find one computer book that meets the majority of your needs. Access Inside&Out is no exception to this. I spent a day selectively weeding out all the various Access 2002 volumes available at Borders Bookstore. I looked for selective criteria such as complex expression usage, applied object properties, and general reader presentation/learning flow. The most organized, in-depth, and helpful I found were Access Inside & Out and Access 2002 Bible. Where one book skips over any area you're weak in the other typically goes into thorough detail and vice versus. The other honorable mention is QUE/Jennings Special Edition Using MS Access 2002. None are stand-alone volumes for either direct reference or learning the intricacies of Access yet together you should be well armed to accomplish some intermediate Access goals. Helen's website (www.helenfeddema.com) may help you determine whether to use her book as one of your Access companion books."
3,Henderson's Review,"I was expecting a better explanation of Visual Basic code, my fault I guess, not the author's. This book was actually my second choice (based on your summary of book). I couldn't find thw book I wanted, I found it but it wasn't offered online."
1,Into the bin,"Don't think of spending money on this book.It's no good as a quick reference and who has time today to walk your way through 1000+ pages?The book is as unwieldy as the product it describes. Be happy, if you can get by without ever touching Microsoft Access (and this book)."
3,Indulge,"A doctor with dark secrets. How an intellectual human being can be control with the emotions of jealousy. The book contains great words ""unparallleled virtues of a perfect partner."" This book is free flowing, easy to read with a zest of happiness."
4,A different spin...,"This is probably the most unique telling of the Robin Hood legend that I've read so far. It's told completely from Robin's perspective. It begins with Robin in the crusades. He ends up becoming a sort of undercover spy for Richard. Also, Marian is Robin's sister in this version...don't worry, for those who like romance, there's another lady love for Robin. I recommend this book for anyone interested in Robin Hood."
1,Those shipped are not ULTRA as advertised,Be warned that you will not get the Ultra brand of Duracell. If you go to their website (Duracell) you will readily see that the standard Coppertop are inferior to the Ultra type. The standard Duracell AAA batteries are model MN2400 whereas the Ultra are model number MX2400.
3,THESE ARE NOT DURACEL ULTRA - LOOK CLOSELY AT PICTURE!,"Duracell batteries are great, however, these are not the Ultra-type, as represented here. Look closely at the picture and you will see what you will receive in the mail - the regular batteries!"
2,"Wrong picture, wrong product - Not ""Ultra"" type","While I did receive 8 AAA batteries, they were the standard ""Coppertop"" model and not the described/pictured ""Ultra"" model."
1,Arrived quickly but at least one was defective,"I bought batteries to fill out the $25 minimum purchase required for free shipping. They came quickly, but at least one of them had no charge in it. Needless to say, the price was nothing special, so the product was disappointing. And believe me, it's too much hassle to ship them back for a refund, so I confess I didn't even try."
1,Duracell Ultra Leak,"Today my home telephone, which is like a mobile in that it has caller display and a number directory etc. indicated that the back up batteries required replacement. I had fitted Duracell Ultra batteries to it. When I opened the battery cover one cell was severely corroded, as was one of the contact springs. the housing was also covered in fluid. Needless to say I shant be using their products again.Steve."
3,Broke after 4 years,"Great product, the best non-stick properties of any non-toxic pots. Don't get me started on using Teflon around my food. However, after 4 years of use the handle detached, because the spot welding was shoddy on 2 out of 4 welding points. Not sure where to start on warranty."
3,ok,This book was not new...it had mess up edge like what the seller notes. The insides were good conditions. It took more than the expected date of arrival...
3,Ring box is good,The box itself is good but the holding system for the ring is less than desired. It is too difficult to put the ring into the box. Also it looks like the holder will wear out quickly.
2,Cheap look and feel,"It hasn't been easy finding a decent box for the ring I got for my fiance. Truth be told, this is slightly better than the three others I've ordered online recently only to throw them away as soon as I got them. This could have been so much better if someone had picked a better color and material for the hinge which is cheap looking and poorly installed. The wood finish was also poorly done with small areas missed during the varnish application. Great company to deal with, unfortunately not a great product considering the reason why the average customer would order this."
5,Great deal!,"I'm very happy with the jewelry box...When I ordered this item, I was going back and forth between another jewelry box and I definitely made the right choice. For those of you in the same predicament, here's my take: the item is not quite as dark as the picture looks but still quite a handsome piece. It is a deep, rich cherrywood with a definite red undertone. The box arrived a day ahead of schedule and in good condition. A great buy!"
2,Not quite as dipicted.,"Be warned, this product does not look quite the same as the picture might have you believe.You'll notice that the leather in the picture appears to be a subtle off-white while the real thing is a blinding pure white.Also, the interior is constructed somewhat differently than depicted.What is truly disappointing is the box itself.You'll notice that the box depicted appears to be a smooth brownish-red in color. In reality the color is vibrant red. I'm talking clown nose red. I'm talking call girl's lipstick red.The varnish or lacquer or whatever it is is applied so thickly there's no telling whether this is truly cherry wood or not.If the above described seems like something you'd like to purchase, know there are similar items sold here on Amazon for less.VERY DISAPOINTING."
5,Good customer service,"I received this product ahead of schedule but there was a minor defect with the box. However, the seller graciously offered to replace the box free of charge. The second one was in excellent condition. Really appreciated it!As for the box, it is quite shiny and glossy. If that's what you're looking for then this box is perfect."
2,Won't ease the mind about shark attacks,"With the recent shark attacks on the East Coast, children may be afraid to go intot he water. This book does not ease the mind. It does try to give some statistics showing that shark attacks are unlikely but the up-close color photographs of teeth-bearing sharks do little. This book may actually give kids more to worry about: ""You will more likely die of an illness, being in a car accident, drowning, eating food with harmful germs, or being shot [than get attacked by a shark.]""Not recommended reading."
1,Right idea....wrong implementation,"Watt attempts a very good thing in this book: he essays to summarize the main concepts in 3-D graphics in a concise and easy-to-understand way. This is definitely a necessity for a Computer Science undergraduate. Unfortunately, typos cover this book, examples are unclear, and many jumps in logic are made. This causes extreme suffering for the undergraduate who is forced to use it as their Graphics text book. Though I prefer this text over the ""White Death"" (Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice), it is not much better in helping a beginner understand the basics."
2,too short for the $,"Pretty pictures but there were way more photos in the book! This is a short, advertising trailer... not a stand alone DVD."
5,Needed two of this pumps.,"Had an issue that the engine power would go down and not accelerate. Once I replaced my malfunctioning pumps, my 190e has been running great."
5,Worked great,Not much to say...it's a splitter and it works well.Not much to say...it's a splitter and it works well.
5,An excellent movie,"The kind of movie you hope will soon be on DVD so that you can keep it for years to come, I know I'll be the first to buy a copy, I've already worn out 2 tapes. Sonya Braga was excellent as was Richard Dreyfuss.Don't miss it."
4,Great,This has always been one of my favorite movies. I am glad to finally have it in my collection. Always easy to order from Amazon.
5,Died Laughing,"over Sonia Braga's exagerrated grind on imposter/dictator Dreyfuss's prone form while she works out her speech about their ""friendship."" More death when Charo lisped ""a delicioushh break-pass"" poised charmingly with her cart. The women in this comedy were terrific --the men were up to the challenge. I think Dreyfuss is in one of his best roles here. I can't speak for Raul Julia, since this is the only movie I've seen him in. Tim Conway shows up here in a role that suits him perfectly. The movie keeps up a good comedic pace -- you are either smiling or laughing fit to split your sides. Still, my favorite line in the whole movie is serious. Delivered by Sonia Braga: ""To be alive is dangerous."" It's all GREAT -- a not-to-be-missed laugher for everyone and anyone."
4,Interesting film!,"This is an interesting film,I have to admit. An actor playing an actor and filling in for a identical-looking figure who had become terminally ill and/or passed away. That's exactly what Richard Dreyfuss did in this film. Here's who else did the same:Michael J. Fox playing an actor in THE HARD WAY,a Universal property like this film and Ted Danson playing an actor in THREE MEN AND A BABY and THREE MEN AND A LITTLE LADY. Kevin Kline filled in for an identical-looking figure in DAVE. Anyway,in this film,Dreyfuss is actor Jack Noah who films a movie in Parador about the life of a dictator(technically,Dreyfuss assumes a dual role). The mustachioed dictator himself had passed away(Jack sports no facial hair at all). Great support from the late Raul Julia(THE ADDAMS FAMILY,ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES) and Sonia Braga."
1,Diver's watch s(t)inks,Nice looking watch but waterproof seals failed after swimming in a pool! Luminescent numbers barely visible in dark.
5,Really Fun!,"I didn't know what to expect, but using Morpheus was really fun! Morpheus was easy to learn (the kids had absolutely no trouble learning it), easy to use (the kids had even less trouble using it) and fun for the entire family.Combining a child's photo with her favorite pet's, or friend's, showing how one might look older, fatter or (wishful thinking?) thinner, idea after idea--we've already spent hours of quality family time together because of Morpheus and, when Mom and Dad are busy, the kids have lots of fun with Morpheus on their own too.Whether it's for you, for your kids or for your grandkids, I wholeheartedly recommend Morpheus."
1,"easy?yea, right","very difficult, big hassle pinpointing dots, I am very disappointed with this program a waste of time and money just to let people know so they aren't disappointed as i was"
1,NOTHING WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS,"THIS IS NOTHING LIKE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE, VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT AND NOTHING LIKE IT APPEARED TO BE...VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM...."
2,where is the dialogue?,"I love medical thrillers but often they end up being mostly all alike and predictable. This story was not that. The premise of the story was not original but had a twist at the end that I didn't see coming. That is why I gave it 2 stars. The problem I had with this book was the lack of dialogue. The author was telling a story but there was little interaction between the characters. There was a bit too much technical talk. It got to be very boring after a while and I found myself skimming instead of reading. The first chapter grabbed me and I thought I was in for the ride of my life, but it fizzled all too quickly."
5,way back to the good old days of partying,"the package arrived in very good order, I love this music the mixes are soo clean and its when music was music, I am hoping there are more of those compilations out there with some of the same genre"
5,THE BEST OF FREESTYLE MEGAMIX,"If you grew up with freestyle in the 80's and 90's like I did, you'd know that this megamix CD is awesome, especially the way it's mixed. I truly recommend it."
4,Bad Boy review,"I am such a freestyle freak! Growing up in NYC, it was just what you listened to. The music just brings you back to the club scene from the late 80's & early 90's. I loved the song selection on the CD, BUT>> the transition in between songs was a bit overwelming. That would be the only reason why I wouldn't put it on at a party. The songs in itself are so much fun and exciting to listen to. There is no need for all the remixing & scratching before each song, because it takes away from the CD and the music which is what it's all about. Thats my only down note about it because the CD is great!!! I have the entire collection. The music took me back to when I was a teenager hanging out at the clubs in NYC & (the boogie down Bronx) with my friends. I think it's so cool that my kids know now what Mommy's music sounds like from the 80's!Thank you :)"
4,fun in space!,"Rebeccasreads recommends A FOR ALIEN as the third in Troy's Amazing Universe, this time taking place at the All Galaxy Olympics!Troy is a little bit different from all of us: he's a lot smaller & has difficulty speaking clearly, which frustrates his Dad, a lot.This time the tables are turned when father & son are whisked away by a group of Aliens who understand the boy completely, & can't understand the grown up at all! Now Troy & his Dad have to learn about being a team, & saving the world too!A FOR ALIEN has something to teach about teamwork. Do check out Troy's previous adventures: M FOR MALL & T FOR TOY -- they're just as interesting & fun!"
4,"""Fever"" is not great but IS hot","This 1991 little-known and underrated HBO crime/noir film isn't great but the best parts is seeing a young,sexy,busty,bosomy Marcia Gay Harden wearing a super-tight,form-fitting,figure-flattering,bust-accentuating orange v-neck button-down sweater getting abducted and kidnapped by the evil gang of thugs out to blackmail Sam Neil. Later we see her tied to a bed bound and gagged and her huge breasts are sticking out and she is molested and groped while tied to a chair by one of the demented kidnappers. Hot and steamy finale with Marcia Gay Harden just about to be raped and penetrated with a knife after thug slowly cuts open her tight sweater and bra exposing Marcia's spectacular breasts as she lays helpless and bound and gagged with a priceless damsel-in-distress look of fear in her eyes."
4,It just works,"This adapter works great for your Nissan or Infiniti vehicle withBose sound system, durning the install we ran intoA few issues, but that's because guys don't read instructions:-) a word for the wise there are (2) positives for every negativea high + & a low +, if you don't connect those2 positives together, you will have a bunch of extra wires and you won't havesound coming from all your speakers. Thank god wedid a test run before we buttoned everything up...LOLThe adapter itself works great just plug & play to the factoryWire harness which was exactly what I was looking for I didn't want to cut any wires to install my new radio. If your looking to replace your radio don't listen to installers telling you they have to cut, and bypass your Bose factory amps.This is the only way to go"
3,Unneccesary For me,"If you have a Bose system in your 2005+ nissan, this can be a neccessity or pointless depending on what stereo you choose. If you have pre-amp outs and it is a decent stereo this is a redundant system. However was returned easily."
2,Looks good at first sight..,"It's been probably 5-6 months since I bought this so it's OK for me to write a review about it.This phone sucks. Don't buy it. You will have problems hearing what the other person on the other side is saying. Speaker phone is a joke. In a noisy area I use the speaker phone, put it to my ear to hear it.When you slide up, sometimes (very often) the display light doesn't turn off, just dims out which causes the battery die quicker.So many things to say; mp3 player useless, navigation useless, functions useless, you can't use certain songs for ring tones, etc..I can tell you at least one excuse for each feature you have in mind. I was hoping to find a firmware update to fix the problems but no luck.I strongly suggest you stick with Nokia phones or at least stay away from Samsung.By the way, Cingular is not lowest dropped call network. That's a lie. I had never problems with T-Mobile or Sprint. You will get dropped calls if you chose Cingular. That's for sure."
2,Samsung D807 - Cingular wireless version is bad,"i will not cover for all good thing that this fone provide. let talks about how bad it is if you have this cell by Cingular wireless. the screen have pretty good size however you can not any decent wallpaper show on this fone becuase stupid Cingular had removed feature to hide logo, time and date on the display. it will ruin whatever image you want to show off with the fone. go for Sony W810i instead!"
2,Beware,"A word of warning - after about 3 months of normal use, the slider mechanism got ""untracked"" The phone still works but now the front half of the phone with the screen sits crooked. Called Cingular and they said that this was common and to call Samsung. Samsung said it was not a warranty covered issue and that it would cost $70 to fix. I've not had a problem with Samsung phones in the past but this design is obviously a lemon."
2,"Great phone, poor software","I love the feel of the phone. The slide is a great feel and numbers are nice and large.But the Apps on the phone are not that great.The calendar is poor, an all day appointment will carry over to the next day.The contacts will always default to the mobile number and don't store a address.The CallerID with picture is a nice touch, but it doesn't fill the screen! You have a 3x2 in screen and when the callerid picture is displayed its 1/2"" x 1/2 "" What a waist of space.The ring and speaker phone isn't very loud, but does pick up sounds well.Sync program has bugs, with deleting and all day appointments.I'd return it for a different phone if I didn't go past my 30 days"
3,Great in looks but average in functioning.,"It is almost impossible to hear the phone ring in public and for that matter even the vibrator is pretty weak. Even with the alarm, calculators and other such functions they are burried too deep within menus but I think you can change those to your shortcuts and deal with your losses. I guess the + points of this phone are the looks and the feel. Slide is def. the future thing i feel. Speaker phone isn't too shabby either. However my major problems are with the non standard headphone jack, absolutely no accessories and no cables or any software cd to connect your phone with the comp. (you can buy these things separately). But after the passage of initial excitement of owning a new phone I do feel like may be I should have gone for sony ericson or may be good ol' nokia for that matter. But its not so bad once in a while to show off your phone to people because Samgsung D807 is definitely not hackneyed as razor or slvr. I rate this phone between 3-4."
5,Phone with a style,I purchased this phone for free in a cinular family plan. Before investing on the phone i did an extensive research. Many reviewers had written that the phone has very low sound. I took the risk and it paid off. Its an amazing phone. I have been using it over a week and not a single problem. Amazing display . Good camera. easy navigation. Havent tried MP3 yet. The slide cover is cool too. It slides with a gentle push. I would say that this is the only phone which combines features with style. So it is highly recommended.
1,My worse cell phone ever,"I was sold this phone because of the misleading features list.This was a bad idea. And too much of a high price.1) The calls are hard to listen to unless you're in a very quiet place, the volume output is very low (and no, I'm not earing impaired).2) because of #1, you can forget about making good use of the speaker phone (unless, like me, you are in a crowded pace and you want to stick the speaker to your ear to be abe to undestand.3) the navigation among applications and function is not easy. The keys are not for fast tapping and the menus are too intricated.The only positive feature is the big screen, so that you can play games in the airport.I wish I could return it and get another Nokia..."
3,BAD CALL VOLUME but great design,"This really is the best designed phone on the market......camera is great (but no flash, which I found out is kinda important). All the other features are great. BUt again as previously mentioned CALL VOLUME SUCKS BIG TIME. Ringer volume is not very loud to hear ringing in the pocket either. I actually ended up sitting on the phone (was in the back pocket) and cracked the screen 1 month after getting it. Guess Im destined for a clamshell design. I really like rollover minute with cingular, and world phone/GSM capability (crucial if you travel), but I really think Verizon has better coverage (where Im at anyway). Im thinking about switching back, but Im defintitely getting rid of this phone."
4,Early read,"I have not had this handset very long, so won't position this as more than a preliminary review. Many attractive features. A few peeves noticed straight on:1. Annoying screen lock issue noticed by everyone2. Seemingly very flimsy charger connection point with a door over it3. Can only sort phone book first/last, not last/first; doesn't everyone sort by last name???"
5,Exellent phone,It is pretty much samsung version of chocolate phone except for no touch screen and 150 dollars cheaper. It has MP3 and most of all it is free if you sign up for 2 years.
2,Poorly Manufactured - Made in China,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my wife. We have had them less than a year and both are broken. Neither phone will charge anymore and to compound the problem there is no external ""desktop"" charger made for this phone. I have always had Samsung phones and have always been happy. This phone however is the first one that I have owned that is made in China not Korea and is very poorly made. Echoing some other complaints, the ringer is too quite and calls are frequently missed. I like the form factor but can only warn others to look elsewhere."
3,"gorgeous phone, but you can't actually use it...","the volume is a major dealbreaker - honestly, i wish i had read up on the reviews prior to buying it for myself. it sucks. bad. and everything takes 5 steps, like the address book, or viewing a picture. i swear it doesn't have to be that confusing, yet it is. ugghhhh. you've been warned."
2,Not a good one,I bought this phone 3 months ago and within few weeks it started shutting down on its own (Amazon itself admits this is a wide spread problem). So went in for exchange with Amazon( one of the best customer service providers I ever know) and got a new one. what a pity ! it has the same problem. thinkin og going for a new phone. This phone shuts down on its own and you would miss the calls...so eventhough phone looks great it doesn't meet the minimum expectation of being 'on.
2,Samsung phones suck!,"There are no accessories at all that come in the box, except for the phone charger. Just a couple of ringtones. menu options are bad and cannot be customized. phone does not have good sound. the speaker phone sucks! not clear or loud enough.Pros: Light weight, slider design. nice big display. Video recording. Photo capture at 1.3 MP.Cons: need to buy all accessories separately. Bad Sound - this is the main feature of a phone, this con outweighs all the good stuff about this phone."
1,Dont go for looks!!,"Plp, Plz dont buy this phone thinkin bout goin 4 looks. This phone does look good but there are many other stylish phones. I joined cingular cauz of my gf to get m2m free but i made a terrible mistake of gettin this phone. I actually dont even know how good cingular is because of this phone. It sucks!! this phone has no service wat so ever. since the day i got it i have always had broken conversations, static and speaker of this phone sucks. The only good thing is the cool Micro sd card slot but to convert files to watch it on yr cell is the biggest pain, even worst the pic window is really small and the voice quality sucks so watchin yr fav show on yr cell while travelin is a good idea but BAD with this phone. u will be in tears!! overall this phone seriously sucks and cingular service i m not sure yet !!"
3,I wouldn't buy it,"This is the phone Cingular insurance replaced my Sony Ericsson W600i phone with. Supposedly if they can't give you the same phone (which they couldn't because the W600i has been discontinued) they're supposed to replace it with something comparable. There's about a $150 price difference between these two phones so I'm not sure how they figure these two are comparable but oh well.Cons: the speaker is way too quiet, the proprietary data cable is not included, the clear button is too close to the down arrow, and turning the volume up or down is annoying because it rings. I also have a glitch in my phone where it sometimes rings for no reason after adjusting the volume and the only way to get it to stop is to power off the phone.Pros: looks cool, slide function is fun, easy to use, stays locked, large display, lightweight, and slim.Bottom Line: Would I buy it? No."
3,Not for the faint of hearing.,"This phone is attractive and packed with some neat technology. It's a very pretty toy, but not a good phone. Read and take heed to what others have said about the call volume. There is none! The highest setting of 5, would be the mid point at best, for any other good phone.Also, if you really want to go with Cingular, don't purchase this phone through Amazon. They have no real agreements with Cingular, can't port your old number and if you decide to exchange the phone, you must return, cancel and get yet another new number and account with Cingular.Again, other than that, it's a nice toy."
1,Don't buy this phone!,"Yeah it might look like a good phone, but the cons really out weigh the pros. Just like everyone else has said, the volume is way too low and most importantly..the LCD screen will suddenly break for no apparent reason."
2,Weak,"This is a nice looking phone, no doubt, but it is a piece of poop. Reception is not good, some buttons are hard to use and it is virtually impossible to open the phone without touching the screen. My screen actually cracked while opening the phone (which was never dropped) and now the phone is useless. AT&T won't fix it and neither will Samsung. Very disappointed in the phone and both companies. Do your research if you're thinking about buying this. Lots of people have ended up with cracked screens and been out of luck as a result."
1,DONT BUY THIS PHONE,"I purchased this phone in August of last year. Almost exactly one year to the day the thing just died. I tried a new battery and everything. Then oddly enough, my friend had purchased the same phone one month later, and his died almost a year to the day as well....piece of crap!"
2,"Looks nice, but not so great","After about three months of having this phone it started acting up and doing strange things and the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day and a half. After about 5 months it started dropping all of my calls and cutting out in the middle of all of my conversations. Now after 7 months it turns on, but even in full service areas the phone will not make any calls out. I have had to revert back to my old phone which still works after 2 years unlike this phone which died after only 7 months."
3,Good while it lasted.,"I guess I won't be saying anything anyone hasn't already about this phone's good and bad qualities. I loved this phone while I had it, features and all, but yep almost exactly a year of owning it my screen cracked. I was sad. To some people a year is more than enough time for a phone, but if you plan on buying a phone based on the fact that it will last then pass on this one. If you go through phones quite quick then I guess check this one out."
4,Great Product!,Nice phone with good video and picture capture capabilities. There's nothing too fancy about. I love the mp3 player.
1,Piece of junk,"I've had three of these phones and all three have broke. I am very careful with my phones and they still stop working. First one came apart in two pieces due to the slider failing. The second one just became so quiet I could hear anyone anymore. And the third (2 months after being replaced by AT&T) suddenly stop charging. Have three chargers and none of them would charge the battery. Overall, this phone is no good. Find one with no slider and no flip. All they do is break."
3,Look elsewhere for information on Gun Dog Training,"This book is fine if you want to learn about today's top breeders (albeit a little un-interesting). However, if you are interested in actually training your gun-dog, go with something like ""The Delmar-Smith method"""
3,Works...but with some issues,"This works great for pushing my rear deck speakers. Be aware that you may have to purchase a sound filter to eliminate the alternator whine. I used the same wiring for an amplifier I previously had (zero whine), but the eq/amp has the extra noise. Still a good product for the price."
1,Much ado about nothing.,I heard so many great things about this book that I was expecting so much more than it delivered. I think the writer is full of himself and is trying to elevate his miserable introverted life into something redemptive and grandiose. I found only a few snippets of anything that resembled wisdom; the rest was so much hot air.~Peter
5,inspirational,"this book is a wonderful place to look for general guidance in life, especially for anyone pursuing an artistic lifestyle or career."
3,Overhyped,"I bought Rilke's ""Letters...."" based on the glowing reviews and accolades on Amazon. While there is much to be said for the book -- it has a gentle, nurturing, comforting tone to it, and there is great wisdom and remarkable insight into the creative process sprinkled in the letters, they did wander off the path of usefulness many times and for me, ended up being more of a curiosity rather than a precious and miraculous reservoir of wisdom, as say, Montaigne's essays are.There is nothing wrong with Rilke's letters at all, and much right with them, but in terms of them being the holy grail or a serendipitous gift to humanity unearthed like an Egyptian tomb, they most certainly aren't and I would have just as happily read these in a few hours at the library as owned them."
1,Poor translation.,"First, let me say Rilke is one of my favorite poets. That being said...I was greatly disappointed in this translation. There are sections where it seems the translator simply grabbed a thesaurus or perhaps a German to English phrase book and in turn does not do Rilke justice. If you have read or are interested in reading LETTERS TO A YOUNG POET, I highly recommend the translation by Stephen Mitchell. Simply put, his is the best there is. Enjoy!"
5,Terrific! Uma verdadeira obra prima! Um clássico!,"Aos que no conhecem a língua portuguesa, mil perdes, mas sou brasileiro e quero dizer em bom portugus o que penso acerca deste disco. Foi a partir desta obra do Chico que comecei a gostar de sua música. É um disco excepcional, verdadeiramente uma obra prima que no pode faltar a qualquer f da MPB. Todas as faixas do CD so boas de se ouvir, e algumas so verdadeiramente lindas canes, que mais de trinta anos depois de lanadas, ainda hoje gostamos de ouvir e cantar. Comprem, no se arrependero. Aliás, comprem também o CD Chico Buarque de Holanda, de 1978, aquele que tem as faixas Apesar de Voc e Pequeña Serenata diurna. E deleitem-se..."
5,Masterpiece,"I know every single CD from Chico and this one is one of the bests indeed.All these musics are unforgettable, for those ones who loves this music. If you understand the letter and the poetry - if you do speaks portuguese - you can not regret yourself at all by buying this CD."
4,?Where's the Missing?,"Unless I'm mistaken, there's a song missing! I can't think of the title presently, but I think that this is the album that I first found it."
5,Classic early EWF,"This is a very well written, produced and performed musical adventure! Well before they started producing hits for mainstream consumption.This album is like taking a musical adventure around the universe. If you really want to know want a great band can accomplish. Always listen to their music, just before they become ""SuperStars""One of the best Albums of the early 70's."" Hands Down"" 5 stars.DJ Mission Accomplished"
4,Ahead Of Its Time will,"I first heard this album shortly after it came out in 1972. I was young but there was definitely something different about this group. The original album jacket had various black and white photos of the group performing, rehearsing and apparently just hanging out. EWF impresses with all the aforementioned tracks like ""Power"", ""They don't see"" ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone"", etc., but unlike many I like the ballads too. In fact, what I miss on some of the later EWF albums is the deep sensual voice of Jessica Cleaves who showcases her wide range on ""I' Rather Have You""; of course they will balance her loss to a great extent by stepping up the musicianship especially on cuts like ""Sun Goddess"" with Ramsey Lewis. But This album is a must have for any one who wants to experience the evolution of R&B through one of its greatest success stories."
1,Check the shipping rate at checkout before you buy,They shipping rate is not as advertised. It cost more than 8 of these batteries. Buyer beware.
3,Very good for the price (was free after rebate),"The bakeware seems very sturdy. I used it several times each (except the muffin pan), and liked the baking results.The sides of the pans are rolled - it adds stability, but make sure you drain water from itafter washing, or you could get unexpected spill.The non-stick coating is not very good quality - even soft plastic leaves marks on it."
3,Good for the price but....,"I got a set of these free after rebate(that did not include the two round bake pans). Now I understand why. These are a heavy duty pan set but like one other person wrote, beware of the rolled edge on the cookie sheet pan. Every time I pull this pan out of our dishwasher, a small steam of rust colored water dribbles out from the rolled edge. I still use the pans and they do the job, but you think the manufacturer would catch a problem like his and stop it from getting to the customer. I would be skeptical of buying future products from them without reading some very good reviews first."
1,Mine rusted as well,"I am so disappointed not only with this flatware, but with Target and the manufacturer. It seems no one will stand behind this product. Mine looked great and felt like a great set until I washed them the first time, then I saw rust as well. I cannot get a hold of Hampton and Target won't work with it's customers at all. I am particularly upset since I bought 4 sets!!!!! I will no longer be shopping at Target or buy Hampton/Cambridge products."
1,Rust after first wash,"Like most of the users on the site, I too am having issues with rust. Even though they are dishwasher safe (and I am not using lemon-based detergents) they started to rust the first time I ran them through the dishwasher. Dissapointing."
2,Errosion strikes!,"I have ALWAYS loved and trusted cambrige and hampton Silversmith. But this time I am totally disapointed. I no sooner got this set and began using it, and it was hard to get the food off of it. Then it says that its dishwasher safe. But you should not use any detergents that contain lemon. I did as directed. I have only have this set for about a month and a half and its already eroding........makes me very upset. I will NEVER buy another Hampton Silversmith product again."
1,RUSTED WRECK,"After only a few weeks of use rust marks appeared on our silverware as well. Now after 1 year I am embarassed to use the set. In this day and age why would anyone want to handwash their silverware? And besides, the warranty says ""diswasher safe"". We have not used detergent with ""lemon added"" at all plus our 23 year old silverware was washed the very same way and looks like new in comparison. I think Hampton Silversmiths makes totally inferior products. Too bad Target is not standing behind what they sell!"
5,I don't know what they're talking about,"I bought my first set a year ago and they still look great! I have since purchased 2 additional sets and plan to buy a fourth for a total of 16 place settings. I wash in the dishwasher. I never use lemon scented detergent (only the baking soda kind). I am also not always great about washing right away, never been a problem. Even if I let them get crusty, they clean right up!! I love the heavy weight. I only wish serving pieces and such were available."
1,Rusted before they even got out of the package!,"Registered at Target for our wedding. They refuse to return them due to we did not have our gift reciept. In fact they threatened to call the police if I did not take the product and leave the store. I noticed they were rusting in the package and they were never even touched by water. Stuck with a ""brand new"" set that I wouldn't give to my worst enemy."
1,Stainless Steel?,"I ordered this product before. And was impressed with it until in less than a month it began to rust. I don't understand why it comes out of the dishwasher spotted stained with rust if it is stainless steel? I scrub and scrub and it does work but the very next time I wash it, it stains worse than before. I've noticed recently people don't put very much quality into their products as they used to. My mother has a stainless steel silverware set she got at her wedding 50 years ago that she uses daily and it has never rusted or stained."
1,Sharp Edges,"Unfortunately, I had to discard this product because a few of the spoons had sharp edges that cut the corners of my mouth."
5,Great flatware and super service.,Received flatware quickly. It was packaged very well. Product is exactly what I was expecting from the sellers description.
5,These are terrific!!,This is the best silverware I have ever used - they are very classic with their look and they have a terrific weight to them. They are almost half the price of the exact same product sold by other retailers as the Cafe 20-Piece Flatware Set.
1,mine rusted too,"My set rusted as well very, very quickly. I gave my old set to charity the same day I bought this set and within a week, I had rust on these dispite following the instructions very carefully. <br />I tried to resolve the issue with Target but they would not return/exchange these with out the original packaging. I got the same basic responce from the makers of the product. <br />Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the reviews that listed all of the others whose items rusted as well."
2,Spotting on the Silverware,"After owning this silverware for about 3 months and washing them in my dishwasher on a regular basis, it looks like there is coating coming off or something like that. There are spots on the silverware that look like a coating is coming off or rust (I cannot tell). Anyhow, I do not feel that this should be happening in such a short period of time. I had purchased 2 sets of this silverware and now I will have to invest in more to replace these. This is not a good product that holds up. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,The war at home,"This is a powerful documentary showing the struggles of a soldier after discharge. The main subject of the movie is a young man severely injured and his attempt at recovery back home. One scene that stuck in my mind is him pulling multiple pill bottles out of a bag and explaining what each one is for. It is a rather tough movie to watch, but it is a story that needs to be heard. One feels that too little is done for these brave and ruined warriors, and for their families, like this gentleman's lovely wife who is trying to put the pieces back together."
3,Its a great documentary,I like the documentary but not that type of film that you could watch over and over again. I really should not have bought this film. I don't know what I was thinking at the time. but whatever. Fast shipping with wonderful service. Thanks for your help.
2,Frustrating,This movie was so frustrating. I felt like there were major plots that were totally ignored. It seemed like he had some PTSD which was not even addressed. I also wondered how he got off the pain meds since it did appear to be addicted. I was very uncomfortable with him playing with the guns. I don't see how a wife could just sit next to him 'playing' with guns. It just seems like the issue of mental health of our soldiers was completely glossed over yet again.
5,"Fabulous, fresh, and frugal!","This is a super book - the ideas are very practical yet exciting, very impressive yet easy to achieve, and very frugal but quite spectacular. Anne McKevitt is a fearless designer, and her book is not just helpful but really fun. While this is a great book for someone just starting out, it is a real treat for anyone who can't bear the tedious standard offerings of most ""good taste"" shelter magazines and books. Strongly recommend!"
4,House Sensation,"Anne McKevitt's book has a refreshing approach to decorating. It's bright & bold, a good decorating book for people who like to express themselves through their flare for decor. A welcome relief from the understated decor & plaid country styles that seem to overwhelm most decorating shows. Thank You Anne!"
3,reasonably okay,"House sensation has some good ideas however, rather than just being full of ideas as most books of this type are, is instead a showcase for rooms which the designer has redone. Some of her stuff is simply ghastly, but it has a good ""HOW TO"" section & some good ideas for doing things on a (small) budget. Worth getting - but just borrow don't buy."
3,Cybernox is a bit overrated,"The construction quality of this pan not what you'd expect at $100, and the 'non-stick' qualities of the interior lining are vastly overrated - close to, but not as good as, seasoned cast iron, and greatly inferior to teflon, especially for fat free cooking. I bought this pan because of health concerns with teflon frypans.I will happily keep this pan until a better material comes along.If you'd like to buy this product now instead of waiting, I recommend dvorsons.com."
4,"Very good-looking, but still stick pan","I bought this pan thru the Warehouse deal that was a fraction of the full price ($30) and this is the only reason that I keep this pan. Yes, it looks very nice with almost mirror finish, good overall construction (smooth inside). But I wish it's stick resistant properties were much better then they are right now and it had thicker base. Yes, you can easily deglase your pan after cooking meat but I tried to make some pancakes ( to see if teflon pan could retire) and they sticked very bad, even after required preheating and putting oil in it. I have other stainless steel fry pans from Kitchenaid with much thicker base and I found that I prefer them to this pan. But 4 stars for overall good construction, a little bit better stick resistance and as a real advantage - you can use it as a mirror! But look for deals to get it for less( much less!)."
2,"OEM fit, OEM problems","While this tank works just as good as the original, it shares the same faults as well.Driving on rough roads likely will cause the tank to pop out of it's mount, and if you are lucky, that is all that happens. Unfortunately all too often the hose will snap and your radiator will run out of fluid in a mild hurry. I strongly recommend instead buying a stainless steel overflow tank that bolts in."
1,Wheres the melody?,This is dreadful!!!There is no melody and i cant understand what she is saying!A real dissapointment
1,I wanted to choose 0,"When I heard Mariah's single in MTV, I was shocked that this can be called 'music'. This song hasn't got rhythm and melody. I'm not delighted at all, though I expected a very good single. What happened to the previous melodious tracks? I don't know."
4,Mariah is good!,"This is the single off of Mariah Carey's new CD, ""Glitter"".I really like this song. The single includes ""Loverboy"" (with Cameo) and the remix of it featuring Da Brat, Ludacris, Twenty 2, and Cameo. The song has a good beat to it. Mariah hits all the high notes perfectly and as always, she has her sexy coos in the background."
1,HORRIBLE!,this is One of the many Problems with the music business:Weak Re-makes.Cameo's Jam is that a Funk Jam that should never be re-done especially from Mariah Carey.for the most part of Her Career She has Jacked other people's Work&taken Credit&this is the latest in the long line.it's Boring&Predictable.Cameo deserves far better than this mess.
5,The most entertaining single in a while!,This maxi single is worth every single penny. It features incredible remixes by MJ Cole & David Morales. Mariah also uses her light and fluffy voice on this record which sounds incredible the hard beat. The song has marked Mariah's return to the charts and her first single on her new label. This is going to be great.
1,ho hummmmmm,i don't think that a person should review a song based on their music video and therefore those who say that this song is tasteless because of the video are not that bright. i gave this song 1 star because it is boring. it feels superficial. mariah is wasting her talent. it alright to explore and experiment with your music but it would be a plus if one would not uproot totally from one's niche. mariah's radical change in style feels distant which makes her lose connection with her fans like me.
5,"It is not Mariah's usual, but it's Billie's","THE SONG IS BASED ON BILLIE. THE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE IS YOUNG, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT. YOU HEARD GENIE IN A BOTTLE BY CHRISINA."
4,Indiana Jones rocks,"I thought the movie would completely suck, but it kept my attention. It's a nice addition to the Indiana Jones story line."
2,What were they thinking,"There is one thing great about this movie. The totally accurate picture of NKVD/KGB agents. It is also fun to see that amazing piece of American brain power the DKU (Duck). Other then that everything is forced, and ending is so over the top it hurts. Ok so the ending all of the movies using this character have been over the top, its just that this one is out of this world."
1,Just horrible.,"Stunningly awful, on just about every level. Mirthless, wooden, stupid, dull. What little in it was all right was not original, and had been done better in previous Indie outings; what little in it was original was depressingly bad. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of my life. This tired, phoned-in, money-grubbing posier is a slimy slap in the face to the ""Raiders"" legacy, and an insult to those of us who enjoy screen adventures. A shameful waste of opportunity."
4,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is the fourth installment in the Indiana Jones series and it follows the same storyline and formula as it's three predecessors. All I heard about this film before I watched it was that it didn't compare to the originals and that the special effects were terrible. Well it is true the film didn't compare to the originals but, the film was still enjoyable and keep my interest. As for the special effects, they may have not been the best but, they fit the lighthearted atmosphere of the film. The film is worth watching for fans of the series and if you enjoy action/family oriented films (such as Transformers)."
4,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc),"A typical, entertaining Indiana Jones adventure, but without the full zing, coherence and cliffhanger story that previous ones had."
4,I liked it,"Some like blonds and some like red heads. Some like a women fat and others skinny. Some like FORD WHEN HE WAS YOUNG, but he is older and he can not stop that. NO this film was not like the first, but I liked it.I buy a lot of movies since I am old and can't do much else... So for all those who did not care for this film, it is just another Indy film with an older star.John Bolton....Ga"
3,the lighting was typical of the new movies it wrecked it for me,As in many movie these days the cinematographers are using unnatural light and unnatural filters over the lens which makes the movie very unwatchable. its to bad the shot it this way instead of the way they shot the previous indy pictures.
4,A Satisfying Continuation of an Immortal Saga,"There is nothing more thrilling than the iconic Indiana Jones music starting up. It conjures up images of whips, explosions, and golden idols. Now we join Indy once again a little bit later and a little bit older. Despite his age, Jones can still battle with the best of them. To avoid spoiling the ending which I am sure you heard, I'll tell you that there are some favorite characters returning and another mission (a cheesy one but a mission nonetheless) to fight his way through. Now he is better dead than red instead of beating Nazis' head together. And despite the strange and slightly unsatisfying ending, the movie has plenty of classic Indy that we all missed so much."
2,Dreadful,"How in the world did they get this wrong? The casting was good, the poster looks about right - but the story was non-existent. I knew I had a problem with this movie when I could watch all three Indy movies as a kid and not have to figure out what was going on. And ironically, as an adult, I got lost in the plotting of this meandering mess. For those Indy fans who got their kicks - great, but this was lame."
1,An unfortunate sequel and slap in the face to Indiana Jones fans.,"If you're a fan of the original Indiana Jones trilogy, save yourself the time and money and skip this disappointing sequel. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg went completely off the mark on this one losing all the essence, spirit, and fun of the previous movies.Instead of a solidly believable story strongly rooted in historical fact, the audience is force fed an overly elaborate and lifeless story masked in an endless series of special effects and cheesy nostalgic one liners. The Indiana Jones franchise is taken almost totally out of context here and regurgitated as an ill conceived cold war era/sci-fi version of tomb raider.This movie should never have been made. It was so bad, I actually got up and walked out. In over 30 years of watching movies, I have only done that once before. It's an insult to all Indiana Jones fans."
3,Falls Third in the Order of Indy Films,"Quite Simply, this is the order of Indy Films from best to worst:1. Raiders of the Lost Ark - 5 Stars2. The Last Crusade - 4 1/2 Stars3. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - 3 Stars4. Temple of Doom - 3 StarsIf you're an Indy fan, it's an enjoyable ride, but don't set your expectations high, like Raiders and Last Crusade; the content of those films, and writing, were well above Kingdom and Temple. Kingdom is hokey, a bit cartoonish(as some have mentioned here), and the Family Reunion was a little over the top, and very convenient suddenly for script? e.g. Daddy-O, Junior, etc. However, even 20 plus years later, it still holds up well to Temple of Doom and a younger Indy. But, it doesn't hold a candle (or a torch?) to Raiders or Last Crusade. Simply watch and have fun, and, suspend ALL belief in the real world. Remember, in Hollywood, heroes don't get hurt or killed, UNLESS the script really needs them to! (And, then, do they really die?)"
3,A long and winding amusement ride,"The plot is ludicrous at best but the important thing is this movie succeeds in advancing the Indiana Jones franchise and its mythos nicely. The movie is essentially one death-defying action sequence after another as the heroes and the villains race to solve the mystery of the crystal skull. At the end of the long amusement ride, the movie nicely ties up Harrison Ford's tenure as the hero while introducing Shia LaBeouf as a potential successor. Mr. Ford is as charismatic as ever stealing almost every scene, while Shia fulfills the youthful eyecandy factor quite well (although his character is as typically one-note as his roles in other movies). Cate Blanchett adds a bit of sexy mystique to a rather sterotypically written female villain. Other than that, it's not a memorable movie, but it is a sequel that fulfills its purpose."
2,Overpriced much?,"This movie was cute fun, but not up there with the original trilogy. Either way, I would buy it normally because it's Indiana ""Friggin"" Jones, but not at $35. Sorry, Georgie, but you'll have to make your next billion without me. No single movie is worth $35 - ever!"
2,Sad ending to the once great series,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It felt like it was trying too hard to prove it was a ""real"" Indianna Jones movie: Scene with lots of bugs? check; Scene with lots of restless natives? check; obligatory car chase scene? check. It includes all the standard stuff that makes up Indiana Jones movies, but without any of the heart. Harrsion Ford's voice was not up to the task, as only occasionally did it sound like the old Indy that we all loved. As someone who bought all the previous movies, I am glad I decided to rent this one, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't."
4,A fun movie to watch!,"I actually enjoyed watching this movie, despite all the negative feedback it's had. I think if you like all of the other 3 movies you'll enjoy this as long as you keep an open mind."
2,George Lucas' new trend? Poor casting and shallow scripts,"It's pretty amazing that the same director who cranked out stellar blockbusters now consistently produces garbage. I'm only in my twenties, and hardly nostalgic for the good old 80's, but his most recent movies have just disappointed and this was no exception. They are typically entertaining at first but after about an hour I find myself looking at my watch and by the end I'm just waiting for the tiring storm of computer special effects to die down. It was bad enough that Shia Laboeuf was casted for this but the second I saw the 'surprise' appearance of Karen Allen ... well, I nearly walked out."
3,great movie,"I heard they're making another movie. Hopefully it'll be better then this one. With that being said, it was great seeing Harrison Ford back as Indiana Jones."
4,Harrison is getting old.,"I liked this movie but I bought it for my wife who still has a crush on Harrison Ford even at his advanced age. The characters in this movie are diferent but the plot is about the same as all of the other Indiana Jones movies. Unfortunately, there are no real surprises left in this long runing series. However, if you have the other 3 movies, this one is a must to complete your collection."
3,It's NO Raiders...but what sequel was?,"Okay, it's nowhere near as awesome as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but, be honest, what Raiders' sequel was? Temple of Doom? C'mon! Last Crusade? While tighter than ToD (Short Round... Willie... Falling from airplanes in a raft?... ripping out beating hearts w/ your hand?) , it had it's cheese too (Indy meets Hitler? Hydrogen Peroxide over an open wound via the Holy Grail ?!?). People take these movies sooo seriously. I was RAISED on Star Wars & Indiana Jones, but I realized then that these movies were an homage to B-movie serials (I know, my old man explained it all to me ; ) They're purely for FUN!... SPOILER ALERT...I wish that they would have kept the aliens space-based rather than inter-dimensional... but... WHO CARES ?!? It's all silly, comic-book based FUN! Relax people. You're watching an Indiana Jones film...NOT Shakespeare ; )"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Indiana Jones 4 hits the wrong notes from the start (kids driving while listening to rock music? In this franchise?) and never fixes itself; as a fan of the first three I found myself sinking into my seat, realizing with dawning horror that the movie kept finding ways to get worse--terrible CGI, an awful performance by Cate Blanchett, completely wasting John Hurt--and when it was over I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed National Treasure 2 more than an Indiana Jones movie."
2,I tried so hard to like this...,"Well, the movie settles it. George Lucas: NEVER bring back Han Solo! Ruining one childhood hero is enough."
5,We loved this movie!,"I'm so suprised to see so many here writing poor reviews for this film. Its Indiana Jones. What's not to love? Personally i HATED the 2nd Indy film, the kids being kidnapped/heart being pulled beating out of the guy, eating monkey brains nonsense, but this film was much more entertaining.I loved the idea of his son being a new character (i could see more of the series with this scenerio) It was full of action and nostalgia. My 12 yr old said he loved it more than the Dark Knight (tho i had a stupid grin on my face during that wonderful movie too)I have little to say in the way of a bad review, i do think the chase scene could have been better, but the ants were cool, I dont know, i thought it was great, like i said im suprised at the number of crybabies who were expecting something more than an action movie with the man in the hat and his whip..... It is what it is, pure fluff entertainment!"
1,STOP MAKING MOVIES GEORGE LUCAS,"From the brainless script to the zombie-like performances of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen (Allen, in particular, acts like she's eaten a fistful of Ambien before each take, simply grinning behind vacant eyes...), to the CGI gophers and the fact that Indiana Jones doesn't do anything but walk around observing other people doing things for most of the movie, this was a complete failure."
3,Where's Mulder and Scully?,"I would have given this movie four stars if it had a more suitable ending for Indiana Jones fare. I was expecting to see Mulder and Scully from the X-Files running on the other side of the temple at the end. Seems to me that Lucas could have done much better with the script after all this time. Harrison Ford was great as usual and the supporting cast did a decent job. If you're an Indiana Jones fan you will like this but it will leave you a little dissapointed in the end, just a little."
4,indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull,"Just like the first Indiana Jones movie it will keep you smiling with all the action, fun show"
4,Not bad,"This movie was definitely no Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it had something that most other movies of summer 2008 lacked. I found the storyline to be very interesting up until the end. I thought it was well written and the acting was very good. It was something the whole family could enjoy (well, to an extent). I won't spoil the ending for you, but just don't expect it to be awesome."
1,Indiana Jones The Numb Skull,"Oh dear, time catchs up with us all and this is a sad reflextion of the truth for Messers Lucus,Spielberg and Ford.The viewing was like going back to the original for the FIRST 5 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE, then the boredom set in and a stupid plot and a hard to believe ending, come on it's 2008 we are not that easily taken in buy this poor plot and acting. Ford appears in most scenes with the look and sound that he is on his last legs and it is such an effort to continue.The Direction by Speilberg is his worse yet, the movie just does not gell.I was amazed how much we are ment to believe, that the Russians were everywhere in the 50's and took over anywhere in the U.S. at will.The best part of the Movie for me was the opening shot with Elvis singing Hound Dog over the cars racing in the desert. This is a case of money not well spent, the only saving grace in this Movie was Ray Winston's solid preformance, sorry I can't say that about the rest of the cast."
1,Ugh,"Quite simply, this is a crummy movie -- a wholly unworthy successor to its three predecessors. If it didn't feature the Indiana Jones character (or, rather, a pale facsimile thereof) no one would bother seeing it or giving it more than three stars (to be charitable). The gaping plot holes, shoddy dialogue, overuse of CGI, and over-the-top-unbelievable action sequences have been amply covered by other reviewers, so I won't rehash them here. I'll just respond to those who claim that it's ""only entertainment"" that the movie doesn't even work on that level. ""The Mummy"" is a fun, entertaining movie; ""Crystal Skull"" is a plodding exhumation of a franchise that should have ended with ""Last Crusade."""
1,Someone please tell George Lucas to retire already,"As a fan since I was little of the original Indiana and Star Wars trilogy, I knew I had to at some point watch this movie but I waited till it came out on video because while it was in theaters I wasn't hearing many great things about it.Yeah, someone needs to help George Lucas understand that he should not be in the Production business much less ever write a script or (gulp) Direct. I think Spielberg did what he could with it as a Director but what I cannot stand is the horrible and completely out of date writing.The movie made a lot of money, but if Police Academy 12 had a marketing budget like this movie, I'm sure it would do well also.I think this movie was terrible and I really hope they do not make another one."
1,What a pitiful attempt by Spielberg and Lucas,"You can not even blame Harrison Ford's age for this disaster. The blame lies directly with Spielberg and Lucas for this pathetic attempt. From the flying fridge to the monkey rescue, this movie is worse than the last installment of The Mummy series. Poor effects and horrible script. I saw it opening weekend and twenty minutes into it I was looking at my watch and counting the minutes.However, I do hope they release another one because the current pattern dictates that the next one should be a classic. Raiders was, Temple of Doom was painful, Last Crusade was fantastic, and Crystal Skull was trash. If the pattern continues, the next one should be worth checking out."
3,A good movie,"This is a good film. Though not as good nor does it hold the suspense, action, drama, and climax of the others, this still was a decent movie. The most far fetched scene and obviously unrealistic is in the beginning of the film when Indy hides in a refrigerator and escapes a Nuclear blast. All the refrigerators in the entire town are blown to smithereens (as expected from a Nuclear blast), but somehow Indy's flies and bounces all over the place, and yet he emerges unharmed without a scratch on him. Unrealistic!!Besides this the film was decent and I purchased a copy and have watched it twice thus far. Wont watch it as much as the others, but glad I bought it.C+ rating"
4,I liked it,"It was a fine movie, it felt like indie to me. It wasn't exactly the story I expected, but it looked like they had a fun time making it and I had a fun time watching it. blu-ray was totally worth it."
1,mindless comic book action,i waited for almost 20 years for another jones adventure and they give usa mindless piece of comic book action like the pirates of the carribeanmovies. harrison ford is way to old to be playing the lead anymore. pleasespare me from any glowing reviews that this movie was worth watching.don't waste your time buying this one.
3,OK. Nothing Special,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is set in the 1950s, as opposed to the 1930s, as in the previous movies in this series. In this one Indy is on the trail of a Crystal Skull, which is believed to have magical powers. As it is now the 1950s, the Soviets have replaced the Nazis, as Indiana's main adverseries.I felt the movie captured the era very well, the clothes, the politics and peoples attitudes at the time etc. There is a lot of action going on also, and found it enjoyable for the most part. Where I felt the movie fell apart was towards the end. It all started getting a bit too far fetched for my liking, and I can't help but feel, that this movie has somewhat tarnished what was an excellent series."
1,Regurgitated Garbage... with a SIDEKICK!,"This movie is just regurgitated garbage from Speilberg and Lucas. It like its lead actor is a tire old worn out mess. And what do they do to spruce up this old hag of a movie? Why they throw in a young sidekick! And who better than to play it but Mrs. Speilberg herself Shia 'I am not really good looking, not really talented, and not really anything special... except to Stephen) Lebeouf! Yipeee!Save your money and rent 1 or 3 and if you want to prove how bad this pile of dung is watch 2 it is even better than this.Harrison Ford? Retire please. You are worn out and you haven't done anything origional or even good in years. Lucas? Keep sitting on your big pile of money and keep producing the same two movies over and over and over. Speilberg? Take your girlfriend and get on Death Star and go to Dantooeen forever. This movie is a bloated old worn out mess."
1,It's not working in US..,This DVD is not working in the US DVD's systems. If you buy it in US I think the only way you can watch it in your computer.
3,Retire George Lucas!!,"I thought this was okay...not the revised updated character like Sly Stallone did with Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. I think the problem here is George Lucas. This guy has not been relevant since the Empire Strikes Back!! Keep George out of the next one...and get some new ""eyes"" for the next time. Yes, there needs to be another try. I don't want the bad taste of this latest one to linger in my memory!!"
3,Not The Thrilling Ride You'd Expect,"This Blu-ray 2 disc edition aren't the rollercoster ride you would expect from an Indiana Jones movie. It may pretend to be, with its numerous set pieces, believable or otherwise (case in point: saved by lead-lined fridge from a nuclear blast). The plot points are also tired overused cliches which won't impress. For instance, the use of alien as the originator of ancient civilization and Russians as the villain. It would have been better if this Indy outing had used history, artifacts as its anchor.Product-wise, the picture & audio quality is good, as expected for a Blu-ray release. The plethora of special pictures also doesn't disappoint, a standard befitting the price tag. Unfortunately, the feature movie disappoints.."
4,"""Good, But Long Waited Sequel!""","Harrison Ford and more star in Steven Spielberg's 2008 adventure sequel.In 1957, Indiana Jones locates an ancient artifact that Russians wantto use as a weapon. This is a good, but long waited sequel. It's greatto see Harrison back as Indy and this dvd set has nice picture andsound plus neat extras. I recommend this."
1,Horrible,"This movie was horrible. A fan of the first three, I have decided this forth Indiana Jones film does not qualify as an addition to the classic trilogy.Why all major characters had to be introduced by being kidnapped, why there was a lack of any intriguing local characters and villains in the film, and why the ending was an incomprehensible disaster are beyond my understanding, but none-the-less a let down to my expectations. Add in three time-consuming car chases, some irrelevant and stereotypical character named ""Mac"", a shallow son named ""Mutt"", force Cate Blanchett to play the only talking (and completely unsophisticated) bad guy, and you have a pretty bad movie.I believe George Lucas once commented that after finishing what the public expected from him with his second Star Wars series, he felt entitled to make as many bad movies as he pleases. Here we go."
2,Meh,"I was honestly really looking forward to this movie, and don't mind the prequel trilogy of Star Wars and thought that it was looked a little too harshly upon. So I went into this with open arms, and within the first 10 minutes I could tell this wouldn't be anywhere near the quality of the other Indiana Jones movies.To give you some background, my personal favorite was The Last Crusade. My least favorite was the Temple of Doom, and it still is. So if you are ok with this movie better better than Temple, but not as good as the other two, then go for it.Otherwise, there are some major logic jumps that you have to just take and some wooden acting done my Shia Lebof as well as his mother (forgot her real name).This series they should have just left alone!"
2,"My expectations were low, but even then.","Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be a little silly. However, this plot with the aliens just drags. The big revelations are lame and the end is silly. Are the extra-dimensional beings good or evil? They help start civilization, but they seem pretty careless about all life when the ship took off.The stunts were a hit and miss. Harrison Ford was great as Indy again. The relationship between Jones and his son was ok. I thought the relationship with Jones and the old girl friend was pretty good. However, the plot itself became so silly that I didn't care after a while."
2,Disappointing!,"I think the cards were stacked against Steven Speilberg. He had no choice but to direct this film because Harrison Ford thought it would be a good idea to have a fourth Indiana Jones flick. I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones series and even though this movie does not meet the standards of the other three, I am keeping that DVD because I am a completist."
1,Should have stopped at three,"Don't waste your time with this fourth installment. This movie is a huge disappointment. The CG is terrible, the script by Lucas is a hack job. Nobody looks like they want to me in the movie. They really mailed this one in. Stick to watching the first three of the series. Worst movie of 2008."
2,"Lifeless, soulless, CGI mess...","Great for children or easily-entertained individuals, but a terrible letdown for any serious, deep fans of the original films. All the promises by Spielberg that this was going to be some ""oldschool style"" adventure flick were nothing but pure LIES; this movie got the George Lucas Star Wars Prequel treatment x10 but without the time and care to make things look even halfway realistic. And to think that they waited so long for the ""perfect storyline"" and THIS is what we got... makes you just wonder, ""Really?"" A FEW enjoyable moments, but no real heart. My advice to most: save your money (especially at $35 for a single-disc DVD...).PS: Oh yeah... ONE use of the whip?? (An awkward one at that)"
1,DUD!,"After nearly 20 years, you would think the fourth George Lucas/Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones movie would be great. The first Indiana Jones movie was great, the second was a dud, the third was very good. This one was worse than the second. A big disappointment after 20 years."
5,My son loved it,The DVD was in great shape and has held up well. The surprise is how much he loves the movie despite being too young to have seen it in the theatre.
5,Great movie!,"How can you go wrong with Indiana Jones? Well, except for the second of series of four. This is a good movie and a ""must have"" to complete the collection if you bought the original trilogy before this movie was out on DVD."
2,Far Fetched and super lame...,"They try to re create the originality of the REAL Indy Jones movies but fail. Ford is older and yet he can still take out a group of soldiers like he was 28 again. A whole truck full of soldiers with AK 47s all miss a car full of the ""heroes"" at point blank range. 100+ foot high waterfalls are fallen off of without a scratch on the characters. Man eating jungle ants that swallow and eat a whole human body within 10 seconds. I mean the list goes on and on, pure ridiculous nonsense. The alien factor was kinda cool and the crystal skull mythology was interesting, but overall a movie made for idiots by idiots."
4,Gets better and better,The more I watch this movie the more I like it. There is a lot to keep track of when Indy is following the trail of the skulls.
3,Don't Bother(Spoiler Alert),"The performances are great, the visuals are great, but the plot is an insult to the audience. Ancient astronauts?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!The movies Stargate and National Treasure had the same message, and were somewhat more original."
1,Horrible,"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is horrible, mixing russians and aliens into a confusing soup. There isn't a single action-scene with a hint of realism in this movie."
1,Probaby should not have been done to begin with.,"I was very excited to find a copy on the first day of its release. However, when the ending credits started to roll, all I could do was just sit there and shake my head in disappointment. It did not stand up to any of the last three films. The special effects were not real convincing, the plot surrounding aliens was an aggravated case of overkill and Harrison Ford's age is clearly shown. While the filmakers cannot prevent one from getting older, they should be able to tell when it is long past due to hang up the hat and whip. Just an overall bomb!"
2,Is this movie a fan fiction? It sure seems like it.,"Wow. This was such a disappointing movie. Actually, disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it. It was just plain awful. I'll admit that I was a little bit skeptical when I was going to see it in the theater, but I tried my best in keeping an open mind. I thought it wouldn't be great, but it wouldn't be bad either. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, and I watch those movies over and over again and never get tired of them. This movie doesn't even remotely compare to the original trilogy. I personally don't believe it should be a part of the Indiana Jones franchise. To me, it just seems like a poorly plotted out piece of fan fiction. I didn't find myself caring for the story or any of the new characters at all, although it was the ending that really killed it for me. While it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it certainly will never stand up to the other amazing Indie films. This one is definitely not going into my DVD collection."
1,"A sad, sad disappointment.","I can't add to much of the disappointment already written about this film, suffice to say it's another huge disappointment that I lay at the feet of the once-great-but-now-obviously-insane George Lucas. Swinging through trees with monkeys after speeding cars? Really? This movie is a CGI-enhances mess with no plausible plot, poor acting and even poorer direction. After ruining Star Wars with the Episode I, it seems George Lucas simply isn't content until he ruins every good childhood movie that I enjoyed while growing up. Shame on you, Lucas."
3,DVD,This was a nice package including the book. Unfortunately the beginning of the sound track was not working properly. The rest was fine.
3,"Too Unsophisticated, But Very Entertaining.","There is plenty of action to keep anyone entertain throughout the whole movie. But it has the sophistication of a ""Tom & Jerry"" cartoon. Example, Indy survives a nuclear explosion while on ground zero. A series of ridiculous scenarios as such takes away from an otherwise entertaining movie."
2,The Blu Ray review,"Check other reviews for plot synopsis - I thought it was weak from top to bottom and no where near as good as the other three. I don't want to spoil the finale, so suffice it to say - I hated the ending. Absolutely hated it.As far as the Blu Ray is concerned, I automatically have to knock off 2 points just for being on more than one disc. The content is great, but beyond the first time through the extras, I'll never look at the second disc again. As far as the movie goes the sound and picture quality are phenominal. The effects shots - of which there are too many do look amazing. The sound mix is also perfect. The movie favors the grainy look that Spielberg is in love with for his big action movies, so this may not be the perfect disc to show off your system too, but it still delivers a better quality experience across the board than most new releases on Blu Ray."
1,AWFUL is the word for this movie,Seriously...you expect Indy fans to be ok with a movie about ALIENS?Get real hollywood.
1,Chasing after space monkeys,"While interviewing Gillian Anderson on Late Night many years ago, David Letterman heard a synopsis of the X-Files and said, ""Basically, you're running around chasing after space monkeys!"".Too many years later, Harrison Ford is reduced to doing the same thing. As an added bonus, they managed to take all the fun out of the movie too. Good grief. Let's pray they don't try another Star Wars with Han Solo."
3,"OK, but...",The kids are going to love it. They won't get the Brando hat. Shia doesn't cut it here. Each new movie doesn't have to be bigger to be better. But put on the popcorn. Line the kids up and enjoy.
1,BIG BLOATED DISAPPOINTMENT: Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet,"What a disappointment!The first movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is just about perfect. A terrific tale culled from Judeo-Christian mythology subverted by the core obsession of Hitler's occultic desperation. Talk about good versus evil! That was 27 years ago!But after a 19 year wait from the last Indiana Jones movie and numerous official screenplays commissioned and then rejected by George Lucas, it is hard to believe that this is the absurd, overblown story that was finally agreed on by Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. What happened to Frank Darabont's version?What ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is really about is three old men looting their fans' wallets with a highly anticipated and decidedly empty parody of the original entry. Did anyone have his heart in this enterprise? A better title would be ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet.""Shame.Nice atom bomb effect, though."
1,"Dreadful plot, terrible acting.","I loved the original Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Its one of my all-time favorites. The series has been a wreck since then. The Crystal Skull installment is possibly even worse than the awful Temple of Doom episode that was dragged down by Kate Capshaw and that little twerp ""shortround"". In this case, its the horrible story (thanks to George Lucas) and the stiff performance by Harrison Ford that dooms this movie. Neither one of these guys has done anything worthwhile in over a decade. Steven Speilberg doesn't do much better with his unimaginitive direction. He goes through the motions in a lame attempt to copy the previous movies. The gag lines are poorly conceived and delivered and as a result that fall flat. There isn't even a compelling villain. A complete disappointment."
1,Insultingly Stupid,"Apparently it wasn't enough to stupify Star Wars. LucasArts had to resurrect Indiana Jones and ruin him too. This movie is TERRIBLE!The old mysticism, historical intrigue, intelligent humor and charming characterization is completely absent from this stinking rehash. There is only a pablum mixture of trite, childish dialogue, overused and outdated cliches, lousy acting, and a plot that seems to blend the most banal elements of ""Da Vinci Code"" with ""The X-Files."" I am angry that I had to pay for this with actual money. Enough said?Addendum: In fairness, the actors did their best with awful lines. And Ford has such screen presence, it's always a pleasure to see him in action. I just hope his next project has more substance."
4,Why all the hate?,"This movie is NOT deserving of all the hate. It's just not. What are the haters saying? That Indy gets himself in unbelievable situations and lucks/flukes out of them? HELLO! That's what he did in the first 3 movies. Sure, the action may have been a little over the top, but this is based on pulp action shows. While not perfect, I think this movie was fairly in line with the rest of the movies. I think the Mayan - Alien thing isn't that far of a stretch. A lot of that culture is so advanced as to be unexplainable. Ugh. Get off your nostalgic high horse, people, and enjoy seeing one of your favorite characters on the screen again."
2,Quit while you're ahead!,"Once an attractive couple, Indiana and his old belle ought to have remained in retirement and kept their offspring with a D.A. a secret. The settings seemed too much a recycling of old themes and gimmicks. The alien crystal skull premise was never credibly explained and the snake rope bit was almost an embarrassment. The only interesting aspect was Cate Blanchett as a villainess, but even she wasn't enough to lift the film out of the B-ment."
1,drivelicious!,"Perhaps trapping yourself in an elevator and having 10-ton bags of brown sugar slowly poured into the car would be a better way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I cannot attest to your level of dissatisfaction with this odd brand of cinematic midlife crisis. For me, Rambo gramps is not ... I'm getting that weird feeling like when the squirrel is staring at my nuts.And my god, does nerd coke troll Dr. Director have to be so ""Got your nose!"" cutesy? ... Aliens? Interdimensional? REALLY?? OK, hot shot, why do they need the saucer then? Nothing but E.T. wet dreams, I tell you. Why did this turd nugget make so much buck at the box office?Is ""Indiana Jones and his Kingdom of Crusty Skills"" going to end up the opposite of Woodstock, an event nobody will ever willingly admit attending?"
1,Not an indiana movie,"I loved the old movies, and thought i would love the new one. I was wrong.It is nothing like the old movies, like some other people have said-no plot, indi did no exploring, and just lift a bad taste in my mouth.*spoilers* One part he shoots his gun and the natives run in fear to never be sean again, another ants come to their rescue-Yes F****** ants.Finally the end of it is alians. not some old relic, not a historical object, ALIANS Grey Area 13 Alians."
3,Any comment about the Blu Ray version ??,Please ... someone make a comment about the Blu Ray version compared with the normal DVD versionThanks
4,"A bit far-fetched, but definitely entertaining!","Harrison Ford is amazing in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". His physical acting ability has always impressed me. But now that he's much older than he was in the first film (difficult to believe the first film came out 27 years ago!), he astounds! Sadly, I didn't detect the chemistry between Ford and Karen Allen that was present in ""Raiders"", but his scenes with Shia LaBoeuf were magical. The story was fair, but true to the ""Indy"" franchise, the roller coaster began when the lights came up on the screen. I absolutely LOVED how they incorporated the Paramount mountain into the opening sequence. These are some very talented movie-makers. I will own this DVD and watch it over and over, noticing something new each time, I'm sure."
3,fair Indy.,"This is the worst of the 4 films. Harrison Ford is still great, but he is starting to get to old to do this part. They need to bring Sean Patrick Flannery in to do the next one. After all, he has more time as Indy under his belt then even Harrison. The only saving grace of this film is Karen Allen. thank goodness they brought her back."
1,Crap,"Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. It may be worse than Phantom Menace, but I dont feel like wasting my time to go back and compare the two. Seriously, could a movie have any more plot holes? A magnetic skull that can attract iron powder from hundreds of feet away, but can be carried around in a messenger bag and not disturb anything at all. What about you belt buckle Indy? Or maybe your luger? Pure stupidity. I've seen pornos with better storylines. All I could think after seeing this movie was 'Well, theres 2 hours of my life I'll never get back'."
3,The crystal skull,"This Indiana Jones had lots of action, and it had a good plot until the ending. It did not have the same affect on me as the original 3 films, but Harrison Ford was a whole lot younger then. The romance was kind of like an old man making it with much younger women and his age showed in several shots. He is not quite as caviler as he had been, and did not have that sane old pizzazz, but that might have been in the screen play. For the most part the performance was good though and the movie was worth adding to my collection. I felt the worst part was the ending, talk about corny, this even tops AIs ending in that category. So I give it a 3 out of 5."
3,Missing the heart and humor of the early Indy films,"Looking forward to a bit of Indiana Jones nostalgia, we rented this DVD with high hopes. High expectations may be what thwarted us, but this one just didn't hold up to the original Indiana Jones trilogy. There were dangerous insects, collapsing temples, car chases--all the requisite stuff for an Indy movie, but somehow the cleverness, the humor, and the heart were missing. Interactions between Indy and his old girlfriend and her son were wooden and forced and didn't really get the viewer on board. My favorite part was a sword fight between two men on fast-traveling, side-by-side jeeps, but much of the movie seemed like old stuff rehashed. Harrison Ford is still Harrison Ford, though a bit older and grayer, and that was worth about 2 of the 3 stars. Watch it if you must, but be forewarned that it is only a shadow of the first 3 movies in the series."
2,Poor Spielberg movie,"This movie was poor for several reasons: getting geriatric harrison ford to star in this flick, bad continuity and just plain boring/totally unrealistic scenes.Examples: as indy is in the train and the young guy rides next to it on his motorcycle, and presto, all of a sudden they are sitting in a restaurant?! i mean, even a beginner director would not make a cut like that.in the chase scene through the university the bad guys windshield is destroyed by a statue's head, 2 seconds later the car is undamaged.The car chase scene in the jungle. First of all, this scene was way to long, and no, jungles do not have nice smooth roadways through them (in the scene two cars are even parallel to each other. wow, a 2 lane jungle highway)this was a sloppy, careless production mr. spielberg. as if just produced to make you a couple extra million for your kids or something. if this is all you are willing to produce from now on, save us the disappointments and go retire."
2,"NOT COMPLETELY HORRIBLE, BUT LACKS THE MAGIC OF THE TRILOGY!","Well, we knew they were going to do it, every other movie icon from the past 30 years has done it, so why not Indiana Jones? It seems like Hollywood had found another way to find box office gold when it decided to do ""reunion"" films for Rocky, Rambo, John McLain (Die Hard) and now Indiana Jones! It hasn't been a total loss as I did enjoy Rocky Balboa and the new Die Hard films, Rambo only had one good film to begin with, but Indiana Jones had a good run until this new feature film.The film is certainly watchable, but it's so over the top, it's more of a self parody, than a sequel. It just doesn't have the magic of the first three films. This is one time where ""bigger is better"" does not apply. I'm glad I found this in a bargain bin, because I'm sure I won't watch it very often. For Die Hard fans the DVD transfer is very good and there is a short making of documentary on the single disc."
3,Let down,"Horrible way to end the Indiana Jones franchise. This is by far the worse movie in the franchise. I'd rank them from best to worse as 1-Raiders, 2-Last Crusade, 3-Temple of Doom, 4-Crystal Skull.You'd think Spielberg/Lucas and company would create better films as they got older and more experience. /shrug"
2,I thought I would like it more when I owned it... wrong.,"Still the same bad plot and horrible ending. Some movies, especially those recently revisited by Lucas, grow on me over time. I'm a big Star Wars fan, and Episodes 1-3, for the most part, did. I really wanted to like this movie since I still have fond memories of seeing the first three in the theaters as a kid. This one, with it's over the top plot, bad acting by Cate Blanchett, and low marks on the believability scale, just doesn't fit in with the other three Jones movies. It just could have been so much better. No wonder Harrison Ford held off on making this one for so long. He wanted to be old enough so the memory of it probably wouldn't last too long.Maybe my son will like it someday since it's really a kid's movie. Until then, it'll be on the shelf collecting dust."
4,"Product is excellent, the movie not so much",The movie is about 3 stars and I do wish it did better because the trilogy before it was pretty awesome. The product came in good shape and without issue.
3,"Not a bad movie... no, really.","I did enjoy this movie, it had some really good action sequences and exciting scenes, though I can also see why people didn't like it. Part of me wishes that the original trilogy had been left as is, but that did not mean I did not enjoy this film. I would say just keep an open mind and just enjoy the scenery and story even if you do not wish to consider this canon or anything like that."
2,Time for Indiana to retire!,"I was sooo expecting a repeat of the last three thrilling Indy Adventures. This was Ok if you had never seen the others, but disappointing for Indy fans. Karen Allen was too stilted, Harrison Ford seemed really 65 years old and Shia Lebeouf was too dorky. I can see why Sean Connery decided to not join them!"
3,Indiana Jones vs. Aliens...?,"It was good, solid story and very good special effects, but aliens...?The ant part was a bit scary. My kids liked it."
2,Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,I felt that the film needs a re-edit. The flow was broken and the logic is not continuous. Could be a lot better. The director seems to be enamored of special effects
3,Crystal Skull a mixed bag.,"I recognize the hard work that went into the making of this movie, but can't help thinking that while watching it, that not everyone was on the same page. In a word, I was disappointed by this movie. That said, the Blu-Ray itself is good:Special Features: There are plenty of goodies for the Jones fans and for people who like to get an idea or what its like to make a movie.Video: The video transfer you would expect, with today's digital transfer techniques, to be flawless. And it is. So, why does it SEEM like it was filmed in the 80's? Because that was the style they wanted to replicate - that of the three Indiana Jones predecesors. The film used the same photography styles, lighting cues, etc. They even used film in its production, which is now the exception, not the norm.Verdict: Indiana Jones fan = buy it. You'll be slightly disappointed, but you'll have the collection.Otherwise skip it."
3,"Good fun, but not Over the Top","While fun and good to see Indiana again, it does have a feel of been there, done that. There's really no ground breaking, fresh new things here like in the old films. Had this been ten years ago, maybe it would seem different. But in the meantime, films like the Mummy series have upped the ante in this genre. Ironically, ILM did the effects for the Indy movies and the first two Mummy films. At least three effects sequences in this film seem to trace their heritage to the Mummy films (the bugs, the swinging through the trees and the temple destruction). They're great effects, but nothing new.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Widescreen), also released this year, was the superior of the two films."
3,much of a muchness,"The movie was very entertaining, but personally, I'd like to see more interaction in place of the endless action, to breathe some life into the genre."
4,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull-Indiana's Last Stand,"I really enjoyed this movie and rate it at four well earned stars. I believe the quality of the special effects were excellent and the story very good as well. The transfer quality of the Blu-Ray DVD was one of the best I have ever watched and helped make this movie special for me since my first viewing of this film was on my large screen home theater.I am surprised that this film scored such a flat 3 star rating but the statistics are what they are. These statistics probably reflect as much about us, the audience growing old watching Indiana Jones films as the movie makers. All in all, I think it was a very good effort and within my small group of movie going friends I know this film was well thought of and provided a very entertaining evening."
3,"Okay, but was hoping for more.","This was a decent effort to revive the Indie legacy but it left me wanting. What you ask? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it was that Ford was not as full of energy or wonder as he seemed in the previous offerings. The movie is well worth watching but unless you own the first three installments and want to complete the set, rent it."
1,TOTALLY Absurd,"The biggest problem with this movie was that it tried to combine Alien culture with Indiana Jones, did not show us how Mutt Williams really changed by the end of the film (the kid did not seem in the least more interested about school/history), the woman in the story was written deliberately to be a dimwit, the scene in the quicksand and domestic fight between Indy and Marion in the truck was crazy, and the Atom Bomb survival scene was written by a three-year old. Plus we are now supposed to believe that ants can eat people. It's not even a good Saturday Morning Cartoon. The original Indiana Jones movies were B-movies dressed up as A movies, and this is a B-movie dressed up as a D movie. Pitiful end to a high-caliber adventure series. Why didn't Spielberg get Kasdan to write the script--HE was the brains behind Raiders and Empire Strikes Back. Kasdan knows how to write a script."
2,Why did they have to do just one more time?,"I'm sorry, I saw it recently and was awfully disappointed. Appeared to be more non-participatory video game than film.I liked ""some"" the subject matter and particularly the location. But, evil commies? Puleeeze! JD kid, old lost love, comments about being too old for this sort of thing (well, that didn't have to be so...if they had written a different scenario). And happy ever-after marriage, oh brother.There could have been an older and grayer Indy in a post WW2 period. Ford could have pulled it off. And the Inca territory of S.A. would have been fabulous...even if a UFO fly-away was required.Why couldn't Indy have adapted some of the character of his dad!It should have ended with ""The Last Crusade"". All three of them galloping into the sunset and legend."
4,Nice Adventure: Not Quite an Indie Flik,"This is a worthy entry into the Indiana Jones canon, though (lynch me for saying it, but it's the truth) it is a little disappointing. The action is fun and there is plenty of humor. It isn't as dark as the black sheep in the series: The Temple of Doom. However, it doesn't feel quite like a true Indy movie. Without giving anything away, (but you do get this feel fairly early on anyway) it's much more Sci-Fi than the previous Indy movies have been. The original trilogy was all about mystical objects that had magical or theological powers. Here it isn't so much magic as science.And before you call foul, the legend of the skulls is a real one and this movie took one of the theories surrounding the skulls and brought it to life, so it was more than sci-fi sensationalism. However, it still didn't quite ring true to Indy's repertoire."
3,Appears to be setting up a new generation....,Here is a nice young fella who is all archeology and adventure just like...uh... Indy. And he draws Indy into the plot to save his mother--Mary. And the bit with the hat.... just too much of a set up. Not as good as the originals but might help a new Indy style adventure series start up. Young Indy did okay. New younger...uh...guy.. might do okay too--has the right background for it--with his mother and all. Don't think worth the DVD unless you are a die hard true Indy fan. Unless there really will be alternate ending options....
3,Typical Cheesey Indiana Jones Film,"My wife hated it. I expected pretty much what I got. A far-fetched, cheesey Indiana Jones film, chock-full of car chases, over-the-top bad guys, unbelievable sequences that can make your eyes roll with the extreme cheesiness of it, but a decent film for what it is.I would have liked to see this franchise grow-up a bit more."
2,Wait for DVD,"Overall, this movie was a disappointment in the Indiana Jones' saga. The whole alien space ship at the end was hokey. Lucas, yet again, destroys another potentially great movie (see the latest Star Wars movies if you don't know what I'm referring to) with his corny writing. Additionally, the prairie dogs and monkeys also were completely unnecessary. I love the first three, but this will not be a dvd I purchase."
4,"Fun, For What It's Worth.","Well, I think it's perfectly safe to assume, no one thinks this is the best Indiana Jones film. That doesn't mean it sucks. It has good points...and really weird special effects. The parts of the movie that don't have the weird CGI are totally fun and worth it. The ending is overly flamboyant and it was clearly messed up, at some time in the production process. With all that in mind, do you really want the Collector's Edition??? No. You want the movie, with as few extras as possible, if just to prevent any more upset fan anger, directed at Ford/Spielberg/Lucas."
1,hmmmm......,"Like most pople I enjoyed the first three Indie films. However, I was extremly disapointed with this film. Mostly because I belive The Last Crusade was kind of supposed to be the last of the series. Though they didn't Try to make Ford look younger, which was good, I really don't think that they needed to make a new Indie movie."
1,waste of time,Although I liked the previous indiana Jones movie this was clearly a was of time. It was simply best that they left it alone instead of adding another movie that is so bad.The movie is really bad.The best review I saw on this movie was done in an episode of South Park. Just see it and you will understand.
5,Indiana Jones Rocks!,"Great to see that Lucas and Spielberg were able to produce another great hit. Nice to see Indy back for his fourth adventure. Great updating to make sure Harrison Ford could still play the part. And can he! Would love to see if they could make a fifth, but I get the feeling this is it for this great franchise."
2,"Lifeless, soulless, CGI mess...","Great for children or easily-entertained individuals, but a terrible letdown for any serious, deep fans of the original films. All the promises by Spielberg that this was going to be some ""oldschool style"" adventure flick were nothing but pure LIES; this movie got the George Lucas Star Wars Prequel treatment x10 but without the time and care to make things look even halfway realistic. And to think that they waited so long for the ""perfect storyline"" and THIS is what we got... makes you just wonder, ""Really?"" A FEW enjoyable moments, but no real heart. My advice to most: save your money (especially at $35 for a pretty standard DVD...).PS: Oh yeah... ONE use of the whip?? (An awkward one at that)"
5,Indiana Jones review,"This is one of his best films yet. Filled with unexpected action and laughter, this film is totally ""Indy"". It's very cool how this one ties up all the loose ends all the other films had. Very good!!!!!"
2,George Lucas needs to stop for the sake of the fans!,"At least George can't ruin too many more of his characters! I think the only thing left to destroy is Willow. Alien invaders and Indy don't mix! Plus Shia Laboof was a lousy choice as Indy's son. The film was forced in my opinion. Like the original Star Wars films, Indiana Jones should have been left alone."
2,aliens!??.....come on.,"This movie was entertaining for me. I couldn't see it as an Indiana Jones movie though. The writing was lame and very predictable and the whole ""aliens answer all questions"" thing just didn't work for me. I remember a time when movies (not just Indiana Jones) were well written. Now it seems that if the writers get stumped they just throw aliens at you. I think its very upsetting when you are expecting an explanation that you couldn't see coming from a mile away. I wouldn't be surprised if the writers of the T.V. show lost gets stumped and throws aliens in as a cop out."
2,Comments,"I liked the three""Indiana Jones"" that came first. They were all good. I didn't like the last in the series. I bought it only because my husband wanted it. Harrison Ford cannot act, so he needs a better vehicle to look good in. I'm sure that most people will disagree with me.N. Ploeger..Reader"
5,Great movie!,Absolutely wonderful movie full of action. Holds your interest and has you sitting on the edge of your seat at times!
1,I Obviously Wasted Ten Dollars,"I honestly can't believe I wasted ten dollars and two hours of a beautiful Sunday afternoon to see this movie. The scripts are chopped up like rotten sushi with a dull knife and then pasted together with super glue, with a couple gunshots thrown in for good luck. Harrison Ford is obviously too old for this, and no-talent pubescent clown Shia LaBeouf just throws in a couple punches for the ladies. And it's still unclear what time period we're actually in. All the characters that made the first three movies good are dead. If you can have an alien spaceship take off from a canyon in the middle of nowhere after killing another knowledge-phychopath, and then having them all float to the center of the room in extreme graphics worthy of Michael Bay and his crew, then why not just reanimate the dead? Bring 'em back! Maybe it'll boost this review up another half a star!"
1,Painful,This movie took everything that made the other films great and threw them out the window. There is a reason this movie was named Worst Movie of the Year by film critics.It is to the Raiders Legacy what jar Jar and Episode I is to Star Wars. Painful to watch.
1,This Movie is Garbage,This was 122 minutes of my life that I will never get back. How could they make such a piece of crap?! Acting was terrible..Karen Allen should have stayed home....Stupid family subplot...And they wonder why I don't go to the movies anymore..
1,absolutely horrible,"Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, dare I put it right up there with WATERWORLD? I tried, I really tried but no matter what, I hated everything about this film. Everyone involved with this film, should be ashamed of themselves! It is time for Harrison Ford/Spielberg/Lucas and Co. to just stop and smell the Bengay. They are too old and this franchise ran it's course, as had STAR WARS. Move on or retire, please for the sake of all of us. And Shia Lebouf? Please, please, let Transformers 2 be good, 'cause this was not his most shining hour but he's young, he can move on, as long as he stays out of trouble. And Karen Allen? Not hard to see why she hasn't been working anymore. Too bad really but it's over. Couldn't wait to get this movie out of my house. Got it at the library, so wasted no money. I'm done and exhausted from disappointment."
2,Not The Strongest Movie in the Indiana Jones Franchise,"Ugh, not a good movie. I was thoroughly disappointed on the whole with the new Indiana Jones movie and was glad that I only saw it via dvd rental.Yes, the action was good and non-stop as to be expected, but the storyline wasn't even good. The previous three Indiana Jones movies had a pleasant balance of both action and storyline, but not this one.Also, the action scenes seemed to be down almost entirely of CG/computer graphics and the CG looked so fake and unreal, which was another let down while watching this movie. I'd have thought with all the technology out there today, that the CG would have been a lot better quality... I guess I thought wrong."
1,Defective Blu-ray DVD,"My Blu-ray version is defective at Scene 8, beginning at the Indy interrogation scene at the camp with his defector friend.Cleaned, cleaned again, and cleaned yet a third time.I'm running the latest Sony Blu-ray player here, with the latest firmware.It is the disc.Please post if yours has the same problem..."
3,Closing the circle on Indy.,"Another odd story line with a lot of action. If you like Indiana Jones, you'll like this."
3,it had it's moments,"i agree this was a bit jouvinile, i think if sean connery was in it it be better, it had it moments, had decent stunts but to me the plot was no ware near as good as the otherr 3 i feel the plot was lacking, could of been better and still coudl of been worse wasn't the wors of the year but i feel it willbe worst of the series in my opinion"
5,FUN STUFF,I missed this at the theaters so I wasn't expecting much after reading a lot of negative reviews. I liked it. It was mindless fun that made me forget about all the crap that's going on in the world for a couple of hours. Nice blu-ray picture too.
2,Need Something Higher than God? Try Aliens!!,I'm always willing to suspend disbelief.... but not this much.I was very disappointed in Spielberg. Figured as much with Lucas.
4,Just Enjoy,"All my reviews point back to Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies. Don't think, just enjoy. Same with this Indy movie. Don't read the 1 star critics reviews. Take the movie as it is and enjoy a good flick with breathtaking scenery. Cheers!"
1,BUNCH OF CROOKS UNTRUSTWORTHY,"I NEVER RECEIVED MY MOVIE, VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MUSIC TRADER PB. CANNOT EVEN GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM.BUNCH OF CROOKS. ALL I WANT IS MY MOVIE, I PAID FOR IT SO SEND IT TO METHEY SHOULD BE REPORTED TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAUCANNOT EVEN RATE THIS ITEM BACAUSE THERE IS NO ZERO"
5,Good Movie,Shipping was fast and the item was recieved in excellent condition! My boys love this movie!
1,Quite Possibly one of the worst films Lucas and Spielberg have ever made.,"We all know their hit films. and critical successes.This is more in line with Spielberg's 1941, War of the Worlds,Or Lucas Howard the Duck, and Star Wars holiday special, and those woefully inadequate and bizarre prequel star wars films. This film continues the idiocy of the prequels but goes even further afield i was wondering when jar jar was going to show up.And to top it all off the ending is literally the worst i have ever seen in any indiana jones film and belonged in a sci fi movie.Minus a 101 stars if i could, this does not deserve no 3 and a half stars like the so called critics claimed, were they on the payroll? LOL."
2,Are they serious?,"Remember Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark? The WWII Nazis are now McCarthy era Soviets, and the Ark of the Covenant is now an alien skull. No other changes, except . . .Harrison Ford has aged, and forgotten how to act. The witty one liners are now tired. This is like a B-Movie with a gold-plated budget."
2,CGI BE CURSED!,"This got two stars only becaues it is Indy, one of the all time greatest heroes. But damnation those CGI monkeys and that entire scene completely ruined the entire movie! WHY would he use such cheesy special effects and such a cheesy child like scene! IT RUINED THE MOVIE!"
4,Nice dvd,"The movie itself was a little bit of a let down for me. I do not think it was even close to the others in the series. The extra content on the discs was very good, I liked the alot."
2,1.5 stars - Enormously disappointing,"There were a few moments in this movie - some funny scenes, some special effects, some good action sequences. But by and large, this was a huge dud.So many anachronisms, so many inconsistencies, so much *cheese*! I understand there are a lot of baby boomers out there who want to relive their childhood fantasies through movies like this, but come one! Aliens, Area 51, psychic powers, Fonzie on a Harley???...it has NONE of the charm of the original series."
3,What the... ?,"Uh... excuse me... I have a question. Why the hell is this movie thirty-five bucks? I wanted to pre order this to complete my Indiana Jones set but the darn thing is almost twice the price of any other new popular movie. Anyone else feel like Lucasfilm, or whoever, is sticking a gun in their ribs? The movie was OK but not great. This is just another example of ""Corporate America"" offering shoddy goods at an outrageous price. The economy in this country is the pits and these guys are taking full advantage of that that. They think they have us by the short ones and will just pay this ridiculous price. Well, this consumer can wait, let it sit on the shelf for a few years, and pick it up at Target for nine dollars."
2,Indiana Jobnes & the Killing of a Legend,"What a desperate waste this film was. Aliens? Really? That's what you came up with in 20 years? The film reeks of desperation and only Cate Blanchett comes away unscathed. The series ""jumped the shark"" with the refrigerator for sure. From there I knew things weren't going to get better."
1,Shockingly Bad,"I really really wanted to like this movie, but it is a travesty on many levels. The whole thing seems like a retread, and the script is filled with cliches and nonsense (yes, I do think I could have done a better job).This film a horrible thing to do a character loved by so many. At least since it's a sequel (unlike the Star Wars prequels), it's not too hard to pretend that it just never happened. As far as I'm concerned, there are only three Indiana Jones movies, which I love dearly (yes, even Temple of Doom, even though it's not nearly as good). Please don't subject yourself or your kids to this, and don't reward anyone associated with this garbage with your hard-earned money."
1,Pathetic,"It just wasn't exciting. The plot was non-existent, special effects just didn't do anything. After 20 years, you just have to wonder, why did they bother?"
1,I want my money back!,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long while. I can't believe they made a movie with such a poor script and ending.If this is the best Ford and Spielberg can do, its time they both hang up their hats!"
3,"GOOD ACTION, SILLY ENDING","This had all of the possibilities of another great Indiana Jones movie. The startup was very good, and the plot was looking interesting. Then in plopped Shia LaBoef. His character, although mildly interesting, was pretty useless. The quest was good with all of the usual fighting on cars stuff. Unfortunately it ends with a ridiculous reincarnation of the long dead aliens when the skull is returned. It was worth watching, but not of the some quality as the Harrison Ford and Sean Connery team. Karen Allen was very good in her supporting role. Cate Blanchett and her role were over-rated. Harrison Ford delivered, but the story faded to fantasy-land."
3,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,Believe this did not meet all the hype that was expressed. Was an interesting sequel to the previous ones . Probably expected too much.
3,cookbook action thriller,"We enjoyed this movie but it was just more of the same. The ending was deeply thought-provoking, but the only place in the entire movie that was so. Great photography/cinematography, good acting, and good guy versus bad. However, not as much fun due to the sameness of the earlier movies, except for the ending, which will challenge your intellect."
2,This Skull Never Had a Brain,"The only thing missing from the plot of this movie is the kitchen sink. Rather than plot, and letting Harrison Ford have his usual sardonic romp, the writers and producers went through their ""to do"" lists from previous Indiana Jones movies and threw all that stuff in without regard to whether it moved the plot along, or was even entertaining. The result is a movie bloated with ""stuff"" and peopled actors who are going through the motions and counting the minutes until the camera finally runs out of film."
3,Indiana Jones KOCS,I could not get uncompressed digital audio (Dolby TrueHD) in english. It would only work in 5.1 Dolby Digital on the foreign languages and I had to watch the movie in 2 speaker stereo. This greatly reduced the overall watching experience and I would not recommend it for this reason.
3,"Not bad, not what it used to be","After so many years Mr. Ford put on his hat again, holstered his guns and grabbed his whip along.In the past Indy had adventures with a supernatural edge; the basics were always human in nature. It was this humanity that made the movies so great. Special effects and action scenes never make up for a loss of that.In my opinion the supernatural has taken over. The enemy blatantly displays more-than-human abilities which borders on the banal to me and the endgame is more than over the top, instead of merely being an apotheosis of the quest that runs through the movie.But the action was good. Fun and with an enourmous wink woven through it all.I liked the movie, but it wasn't nowhere near the quality of the Indy's of the past. I wouldn't mind seeing another one, but this time with Indy jr. in the lead. Maybe something like young Indy Jones series, only with a bigger budget and better story."
1,Indiana Jones and the temple of bad scripts,"What a mess this movie was. Good to see Indy again but you can tell from the start that Lucas had approval over this script after rumors he threw out so many better scripts out the window (Frank Durapont anyone?).Indy surviving nuclear blasts, Rodents coming up from the ground and grinning at the camera, Shia LaBouf swinging from vines in a jungle with Monkeys and hardly any Marion. She barely has anything to say.Then you get the ending which comes out of a different movie.Suspending Disbelief is one thing but you gotta check your brain and taste at the door for this one.Lets hope they don't make any spinoffs with Indy's kid."
1,Ug... Terrible,"I have never been more disappointed, that a movie I wanted to like so much, was just so terrible. This couldn't have been worse. South Parks spoof on this film was dead on..."
1,Painful to watch...,"Indiana Jones 4 was painful to watch- surving a nuclear blast in a refrigerator? the car chase scene in the jungle? aliens? seriously this was just pathetic and I was better off never seeing this movie, I wish I could un-watch it."
1,Garbage,"Here's the thing... When you think Indiana Jones, you think quality action film. This was not quality by any means.1st of all, how can Indy's father of died? At the end of The Last Crusade, he drank from the Holy Grail so he's supposed to have eternal life. Instead of killing him off, just leave him out altogether.Then, ALIENS?! Are you serious?! This is an archeologist, not a UFO researcher. Just terrible. I saw it in the theater and really felt like I was ripped off. It's not even worth renting, much less buying."
2,South Park had it right,"Indiana Jones gets raped by his creators. Story was dull, action was repetitive, and the ending was a) predictable and b) non-sensical."
2,Low bit rate for a 2008 transfer,"For enthusiasts, the bit rate of this DVD stays around or below 5 Mbit/s most of the time. Compression artifacts such as mosquito noise and block noise can be seen often. For an anamorphic 2.31:1 movie transferred in 2008, that's below standards, considering the running time is only 122 mins and there aren't many extras. (I do not intend to review the movie here).They must be doing this to sell blu-ray discs, what a shame."
2,Worse than Temple of Doom,"To be honest this was one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It was a true letdown because I've been a fan of Indy since I can remember. Raiders was fantastic, Temple was so-so, and Last Crusade was perfect. But this, this was pretty sucky. One thing I just couldn't get over was the aliens. Aliens shouldn't be in Indiana Jones. I think George Lucas got his franchises mixed up. Second is Indy having a son. Don't get me wrong I thought Shia Lebeouf was great, but his character was unnecessary. Now I did like Indy taking on Commies, that was one of the few good things about it. Harrison Ford really let me down."
1,Waited 19 Years for This Nonsense?!,"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a COMPLETE ripoff.This is the best they could do after 19 years between films?If you haven't seen the movie yet...don't waste your $.Wait for the original trilogy to come out on blu-ray.If anyone gave this move 4 or 5 stars, they need to be on medication!!"
1,145 IDIOTS AND COUONTINGS,"How the heck could 145 people, and counting, like anything about this extremely stupid and ridiculous movie. It's was bad the whole way through, and the aliens? WTF, is all I got done saying. I just couldn't get over the fact the I couldn't believe how old Harrison Ford looked. Thankfully, I saw a bootlegged version, so I didn't sink any money into the pockets of anyone associated with this Hollywood garbage."
2,Lackluster money grab.,"Leave it to George Lucas to ruin another franchise. This lousy mish-mash of a film stinks of his tone-deaf storytelling, although he surely isn't alone shouldering the blame. Spielberg, after all, let him get away with it, and David Koepp (an otherwise decent screenwriter) gets credit for taking Lucas' ""story"" and trying to make sense out of it. Much like Episodes I through III tarnished the three original Star Wars films, this sad, overly long exercise makes the original Indy films feel like Oscar contenders."
2,Kingdom of the Crystal Crap,"I wish I could give a better rating to such an anticpated movie. Indiana Jones 4 looked good in the previews, and the characters and action stand out very well. This time, Indy is fighting the Russians during the Cold War, and this works well, nothing bad.Unfortunately, with this story, it became too goofy, and seemed slapped together after almost twenty years since part three. Some of the action sequences are bad (fighting evil CGI ants-please), and without telling you the ending (which really ruined the movie for me), I think Indy 4 falls short of the standards in the first three films.I am looking forward to a part 5 and then they need to call it quits. Harrison Ford is almost 69 years old at the time of this review, so finishing part 5 will hopefully come sooner, rather than later."
3,"Not as good as the others, but good enough","This movie was mostly a compilation of special effects. The ""magic"" of the other movies was sadly lacking. However, it was entertaining. We made fun of the stupidity of it. Still we can now proudly boast we have the whole series of these movies."
2,All good things must come to an end,"Unfortunately, the Indy franchise was well past that best-when-used-by date before this movie was released. As much as I've love the Jones character, played by Harrison Ford, it was a different character than the one played by a now, much older, Ford. I'm not sure whether his heart simply wasn't in it or if script was so bad it never gave him a chance, but the suspension of belief to watch this movie just wasn't possible. The supporting cast just didn't make for me either. Karen Allen was in it for the money and the her storyline was simply weak. And the LaBeouf character was there as eye candy for the younger set who, presumably, find him to be a star. As far as the script goes without giving any spoilers away, it was ridiculous. Apparently, the director, Spielberg, had a few spare alien CGI characters laying around from Close Encounters that he needed to use.All in all, a major, if not totally unexpected, waste of time."
2,Not funny as the previous ones. Most of the stunts have been done before.,"This movie is not as funny as the previous ones.Most of the stunts have been done before.Special effects in some scenes look fake. For example, the scene where the ants attack the guy.It has references to aliens at the end. I believe aliens is more suitable in Star Wars."
3,"My least favorite of the 4 Indy films, but it's still fun","I love the Indiana Jones films (especially Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade) and while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was fun, it really didn't live up to the hype. Not that I thought it would in the first place. The acting is solid all around with Harrison Ford (seeming a little tired at times of this role at 65) and the bad chick played by Cate Blanchett being the standouts for me. The adventure itself is a little on the confusing side, but will keep you interested throughout.The two main flaws with Indy IV are the dialogue which is pretty bad at times (some of it comes across okay) and the heavy use of CGI that you can't help but notice.Just don't go in expecting a soon to be classic movie. As far as the fourth film in a series goes, it is actually good enough to sit beside the other three on your DVD shelf."
1,The Last Crusade should have been the last crusade,"The story of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is dull, forced, and awkward. If you are ""lucky enough"" to see the special features, you will even hear Steven Speilberg himself admit that he was done with Indiana Jones after the third movie (Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade)---There's a reason why Indy rode off into the sunset at the end of that movie. Spielberg was forced by George Lucas to make this fourth movie, which feels like it was written on the fly.As for Harrison Ford's performance: He looks okay, but Indy appears tired and the action scenes are almost painful to watch. Plus, the special effects are overdone.Don't bother. Save your money. Skip this one. I was really disappointed."
1,"""Temple of Doom"" is a 5 Star Classic Compared to this Turkey!!!","Just fifteen minutes into this film I realized how bad it was-Ford acting stiffly when his stunt double or CGI twin isn't running around like a cartoon character; ugly, visually obnoxious looking color photography in dim lighting; bad acting straight from a Ed Woods film."
3,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,OK Film but not as good as the first three. Too many special effectswith no simple story line.
3,A for Effort,"Like so....SO many others, i wish that there were still only 3 Indiana Jones movies. This one was made way to late, and with no imagination whatsoever.Its more typical Hollywood drivel born to capitalize on this once proud franchise. They tried their best to live up to the first 3, but came nowhere near it.So i gave a 3 for that effort, an effort that would have been better spent on a new franchise or a new idea."
2,This movie is horrible!,"If there's anyone out there who actually enjoyed watching this flick, I'd be amazed. What a shame they destroyed the final segment to an awesome franchise with this stinker. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10. It's worth it to watch just because it's Indiana Jones, but DON'T buy it; rent it!"
4,Feeling Blu About Indy,"I will start off by saying that I was disappointed in this film when I first saw it in the theater. Although I was still bothered by a lot of the same things - the sets, that awful snake - I found that I enjoyed the movie much more the second time around, watching it a home. It was a high standard to match after such a long time had passed. There is everything that I loved about the previous Indiana Jones films. Some fans may be bothered by the passing of the hat - figuratively, thank goodness and others may find the science fiction nature of the plot to be a bit off kilter. Still and all, its a fun ride if you just let yourself go and enjoy it. The Blu Ray version has a stunning picture and sound, no complaints there."
2,"Not the Best, but, not the worst either",This movie was fun. The 1st movie in the series is still the best.
4,"A FUN, ENTERTAINING FILM!","Hey, I liked it. I can say all the negative stuff but it was good to see the man in the hat back up on the big screen again. I've watched this movie 3-5 five times since i got the dvd and i thoroughly enjoy it. It's got aspects of all the movies wrapped up in one. Heck, it even mentions an event from the Young Indiana Jone's TV show. It also brings more depth into the character of Indiana Jones and the whole meaning of his life.I can say, though, that he only uses his whip three times (twice is in the very beginning, and once at the end to toss to mac)which is the least he ever used it in any of the other ones. Some more whip swinging and snapping and booby traps would have added more to the feature. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless."
3,NOTHING LIKE WHAT I EXPECTED,I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I loved the last three movies in the series so when I heard that they were finally going to make a fourth movie I was excited. That excitement is gone now. The beginning started out very lame and so much different than what I was expecting. There were many parts that got interesting in the movie but every time I started to get into it something really unrealistic would happen and turn me off. The picture is great on the blu-ray and many of the special effects are fantastic but it takes more than great special effects to make a good movie. If you are an Indiana Jones fan then you will probably want to see this movie but I wouldn't get your hopes up too high because this movie simply can't be compared to the others in the series.
4,Indy's Back!,"A return to the Saturday matinee thrills of yesteryear, with Harrison Ford in terrific form and some memorable set-pieces courtesy of director Steven Spielberg. Despite a slow midsection, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008) is a more satisfying adventure than ""Temple of Doom."" Ford manages to hold the film together, but why do producers shove nonentities such as Shia LaBeouf down our throats? Luckily, there is Cate Blanchett's villainy, Ray Winstone's comic relief and Karen Allen's spirited reappearance as Marion Ravenswood. The formula still works and a fourth sequel would be welcome - minus LaBeouf."
2,Left the Biblical themes behind for tired old typical one.,Without giving away the end i will just say you are better off passing on this movie. Indy has always been my fav movie charecter but this movie ruined the memory.I even thought George Lucas was brilliant for his historic films. Seeing this i realized what a 1 trick Pony he really is.I wanted to give it 1 star. I have waved all my friends/family away. There is a reason the movie is already in the Budget Bin for a new release. It gets 2 stars for nostalgia only.
2,"Indiana Jones, too much of a good thing","Unfortunately, there is way too much of an effort of this film to get laughs. The sarcasm is over the top. The film, apparently, was directed at a much younger audience, who care more about fast-paced action than a intricate plot.The special effects were way overboard and took away from any real storyline and/or dialogue. Entertaining, perhaps, but in my opinion this series has come to a screeching hault."
1,They Fn killed my memory of Indiana Jones BASTARDS!!!!,I was pretty dissapointed with this movie. So many things just did not add up or seemed slapped together. Like after umpteen yrs later Marion shows up and in like 1 day falls in love with Indie? What the heck? And to heck with Shia Laboufe (don't care about spelling his name). His acting just plain sucks. I don't understand why he shows up in big movies like this and Transformers? For some reason he just ruins movies for me. I understand that you have to accept some unbeleivable stuff to enjoy a movie like this but for some reason this just seemed one far fetched scene after another. Mutt swinging from vine to vine and heading off the cars...come on. I'm glad to see Indie again but really saddened that this is how I have to remember him. I was happier before.
1,Aliens? Seriously??,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. Mind readers and aliens belong on a Stargate sequel, not Indiana Jones, but that's exactly what happens here. There is some good action, some decent humor, but the plot is absolute garbage. For me, I'm going to pretend that this Indiana Jones movie never existed."
1,Indiana Jones and Kingdom of Crystal Skull,"Actually, this DVD would NOT play in our system. No, we don't have Blu-Ray, and there's no reason it should NOT play. The icon on the back of the DVD matches our combo TV-DVD player. Other DVDs play just fine, but not this one. It was a Christmas gift for my husband,so I am quite irritated about this. I gave the DVD to a friend to try out on their system, but they haven't gotten back to me with their success or failure."
2,Played out and campy,There is absolutely nothing new in the Crystal Skull. You have seen it all before except this time the plot is empty and painfully crawls along. It's two hours of campy dialogue and silly action sequences. BnB Beatles Depot
1,sucked!,"when compared to the first 3 and the mere fact that we fans waited....I don't know how many years for the fourth, This movie just plain sucked and was corny! The ending was really the last nail on the proverbial coffin!"
3,Just ok,"Whoever wrote the script is largely responsible for this not being a great movie. Harrison Ford could have pulled off a convincingly ""older but better"" kind of guy given the right lines to say. My guess is that someone under 35 wrote the script."
2,Disappointing,"I like most have been a Indy fan from the beginning. Most of his subsequent films in this series did not hold up to the impact of the first. However, this last offering is such a disappointment it was hardly worth your time viewing the movie. Obviously the magic is over!"
4,Decent Addition to the Franchise,"I have been a huge fan of Indiana Jones since day 1 of raiders. This final chapter is a welcome addition. A good deal of the movie is done tounge-in-cheek and the humor is great! As where the action is not quite up to the first three movies, it is still a good story, even though the 'alien' thing is a bit far fetched. The chase scene through the jungle is cool and has some great shots of a Ford GPA Jeep that was used in WWII. One of the funniest points is Dr. Jones' ride in a refridgerator caused by a nuclear detonation test. A good movie for any Indiana Jones fan!"
3,A snake saved his life this time.,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starring Harrison Ford is a decent 4th installment of the Indy series. To me Ford looks exactly the same even my folks beg to differ, his performance is classic Indiana, he plays a brainy goofball pretty well. Cate Blanchett's thick accent is a bit much and Shia Labeouf shows what he's made of as a '50s greaser. Good flick, better than expected."
1,Not an Indy movie!,"I have to echo the same sentiments as others here. I have been a lifelong fan of both Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford, but this movie made my insides hurt.I think Harrison did GREAT as Indy - his age didn't bother me one bit. Shia did a good job as well. Everything else, though, was awful. Aside from the acting, plot and CGI garbage that was all too prominent, the number one issue for me was that Indy never saves the day.In every other movie Indy met and overcame insurmountable odds. It is what makes Indiana Jones... well.. Indiana Jones! Whether fist fighting a camp of Nazis, a mine full of Thuggee cultists or fighting a tank on horseback, Indy always managed to beat the odds with wit or grit or being just plain too stubborn to quit.In Crystal Skull this just never happens. In fact, Indy is saved by others more than he rescues them! Indy is supposed to be an adventure *hero* - what happened to that???Shame on Lucas and Spielberg both for tarnishing the Indy name!"
2,HOW LAME CAN YOU GET???,"Its not a one star movie but it is LAME. I cannot believe how these creative giants, Spielberg and Lucas would ever put there seal on this let alone Create it. It is campy, almost a spoof on the whole series, with everyone just walking through the parts. The ridiculousness of the plot, the villians, the character interactions all combine to create the conclulsion this movie was made only for money. My question is why. The monster mogals have far more than they can ever spend so why tarnish their reputations. It did promote Spielbergs belief on Aliens, but he could have picked a far more intelligent vehicle. Oh well, let me just close by saying this was not even worth renting, a waste of TIME a very precious commodity indeed. JB"
2,Inane and Sad,"I gave this movie 2 stars, but I believe it deserves only one. I'll give Harrison Ford a star for actually taking part in it. But it's inane and almost sad when you think of how great the other movies were --- the jokes are bad --- the direction, the writing and the actors simply suck... and Ford should have stopped at the 3 --- God bless him for doing this one --- but it's too much --- i could not get over watching Indiana Jones at 65 --- and Shia LaBoeuf was stupid --- the whole thing was a waste of money..."
1,Aliens?!?,"This movie was awful. The plot made zero sense, the action scenes were standard hollywood fodder, and when the aliens showed up i turned it off."
3,:0) not bad BUT!,"Not bad love the action, shia lebouf (love him)but at times thought it drag on in the middle because i kind of fell asleep in the middle of the movie as well as my husband. so i would actually rate this 3.75 STARS. not BAD just not PERFECT still watchable and enjoyable. DON'T GET ME WRONG the action was great as well."
3,Dissappointing,"I don't know if I was disappointed by this movie because I had such high expectations or indeed, the movie was lacking something. Although there are interesting scenes and good actors, this movie was too hi-tech and sometimes too unbelievable for my idea of an Indiana Jones movie."
1,dud,"What a horrible movie. I won't analyze it to death, but this movie was a total disgrace to the others in the series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Is this Indiana Jones or E.T.?,This movie was a waste of my time and money. I'm a Indiana Jones fan but this movie was idiotic. I would like to know what Spielberg's big fixation is with space aliens. Could it be that he might of been abducted and probed one too many times because it's finally showing in his latest work. Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
2,Crayola Gel FX Flop,A Crayola let down. The colors were not vibrant. The markers dry up quick and the colors are not bright against the black paper. Usually I am quiet happy with Crayola's products but these markers deffinately did not live up to the advertisement.
3,Two heads,"My boys really like this toy. I actually wish I hadn't bought it. It has two heads that are interchangeable, which is one of the reasons the boys like it, and the main reason I don't. Two little heads I have to keep track of, and they inevitably get seperated then there's the ""We have to find the right head now!"" issue. If you're good at that sort of stuff, which I'm not, you'll like it.It's a cool toy, and if my boys were older (they're 3 and 6) it wouldn't stress me out so much, because it would be their responsibility to keep track of the extra head. She's a good likeness of the character in the movie.By the way, the two heads are the ones with the mask and the one without."
4,Pleased,"This chair, though a bit heavy for a 23-year old, 4'11"" girl to carry around for long, was surprisingly easy to put in and remove from the carrying case. It's easy to set up and fold again, and very comfortable. The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is that you have to get up to change the incline of the back, and there are basically only two settings. I suppose you could change it without getting up if you're bigger than I am, but it's impossible for me to do it while sitting. I also bought them as gifts for my parents, who wish the chairs had a cupholder. My father is a pretty big man, and said that the chair feels sturdy, unlike many others he has tried."
1,Horrible pot....I never did use it!,"This pot arrived with rust spots and when I tried to clean it with mild soap and water, even more rust appeared. I would not recommend this pot to anyone! I never even had the ability to cook with it."
5,No problems AT ALL!!!,"After reading 3 1-star reviews, I decided to put in my 2 cents. I have had this surge protector for almost a year, and have not had ONE problem. I live in a townhouse, and when power goes out here...it goes out! I have had lightning storms, blown transformers, and many other outages. This product protected my Sony TV, Sony receiver, Panasonic Blu-Ray player and my 360 with no problem. I did get the HTS 1000 as a gift for Christmas, so I will be upgrading...but I have no problem doing that with another Monster product. It's not that I don't believe the other reviewers...it's just that I feel that the good products need to be balanced out from the 1-star reviews they are given. This is a great product that not only protected my electronics, but I believe it even cleaned up my cable line a bit as well!!!"
5,Great product at a huge discount,"The salesperson at a big electronics store tried getting me to buy this for close to $100. After looking all over the internet, I found the lowest price here. Many more outlets than a regular power strip with the protection that only Monster can offer."
4,"If Used Correcttly, Excellent Device","I had this device for about 4 years, back when they cost $90, and never had an issue with it. Until, and it seems like everyone else who has had a problem, i plugged in a space heater. After that, the outlet stopped working and it made a high pitch noise and wouldn't reset or anything. However, no one has mentioned calling the Monster Cable Custermer Service, because after this happened i called them and explained that it doesn't work anymore and they are replaceing it for me, i just have to pay to ship it over there. So if you use this device correctly and just plug in home theater type electronice then there should never be a problem and if there is trying calling the customer service, they were very nice and are replacing it for me, so it is totally worth it."
2,Lasted a few years.,"My strip pretty much began acting up about six months ago. Certain outlets had to have the plug jostled and delicately balanced inside in order for them to work. Finally, I began hearing a strange crunch sound when I jostled the plugs, and I knew it was the end. This is not audiophile quality equipment, and shouldn't be thought of as such. That being said, I have had noise and surge protectors made for musicians that have toasted after a few years. So who's to say what is what in that regard. I probably wouldn't buy another one, but you can bet I will try to return the one I have for an exchange. It is supposed to protect your equipment for five years, after all."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this on 9-6-09 and today for no reason it just quit working. We did not have any power surges, storms, and I did not plug anything else up to it. It just quit working! After reading the reivew, I am shocked that it's still on the market."
1,Disappointed in Monster,Had it for a little over year and it just stopped working one day. Very disappointed. Will not buy another Monster brand surge protector.
1,Don't waste your money,Just died for no apparent reason and will not reset. There was no surge. Looking at other reviews on this model it seems that many others have experienced the same fate. Save your money and look elsewhere.
2,Very Dissapointed,"Like some of the others mine also died shortly after 1 year. The Brand has a very good reputation and the salesperson spoke very highly of the product so I spent the extra money. The other day it stopped working and this morning I called the Monster Cable corporation and they were very polite and said I could return the product for replacement.Hopefully, I will have better luck with the replacement."
4,Good product!,"I purchased the HT700 for some astronomical amount (I think I paid over $100 for it) approximately 7 years ago. It has done it's job flawlessly the entire time I've owned it. One day it just stopped working, and to my surprise, I called Monster customer service and they agreed to replace it with the newer HT800 model at no cost. I had no receipts or proof of purchase. I simply had to ship the defective one to them and they said when they receive it, they would ship the new one out. Gotta love great customer service! I will purchase Monster products in the future simply because of this experience."
1,Stopped working after 6 months,"I purchased the HT700 6 months ago, and today it quit working unexpectedly. Based upon the other reviews, I do not believe there was a surge. Please don't waste your money on this cheaply made abomination."
3,"Okay, in parts","This show used to appeal to my sense of humor. I liked seasons 1 and 2 much more than season three. Season three has a lot more ""gross out"" humor, and that doesn't appeal to me at all. Overall though, I still love the characters and I'll continue to watch."
2,Not up to season 1 and 2 standards,"I was a total fan of seasons 1 and 2 and bought every episode, SO FUNNY!, but season 3 has not been nearly as funny, the scripts just seem to be lacking , maybe its run its course? I hope not , I hope it gets better"
1,Quality of this show decreases with each season,"I LOVED season 1, was pretty happy with Season 2, but by Season 3 I realized the magic that made it so funny had been lost. I guess that happens eventually with most shows. I used to laugh all the way through an episode of Workaholics, but now I find myself rolling my eyes a lot at the severely juvenile gross-out ""humor."" I hate to say it, I like these guys and love what they did with the first season, but this show has jumped the shark."
1,Awful,The show's first two seasons are classics. Something's gone terribly wrong. Not one episode in season 3 is worth watching.
5,favorite show,Some episode are funnier then others but there all great and halarious love there sense of humor no other show like it i hope they continue for awhile.
5,FunnyS*#t!!!!!!,I love this show!!!! Can't wait for the next season to come out. Love Amazon Prime too! It le's me pick and choose which shows I want to watch so I don't end up paying for content that I don't watch!
3,WWII bullies in basic,"Movies about Army or Marine basic training alwaystalk about how hard it is.Young men with no military training are put togetherwith a sergeant who has the task of making them ablemarch, obey orders and fire a weapon.For some people obeying orders is not a task they want.In this movie there are three sorts of bullies:1) big private next to you2) the sergeant3) the Jewish intellectualThe problem of homosexuality in the services duringWWII as being a crime is also touched on.From my own experience in the Army the picture didn't seen toorealistic. I like some of the humor, but that wasn'tenough to revive the result for me.The crazy sergeant with the metal plate in his headjust didn't ring true."
1,Biloxi Blues,"I expected this movie to be much funnier. Christopher Walken and Matthew Broderick were good. It stated out with a few laughs, then quickly went downhill. Too long with a much dragged out plot."
4,...It's like Africa hot,"I am thrilled to see this DVD is finally going to be made available. In college I my theater troupe pulled off ""Biloxi Blues,""I went to see Christopher Walken perform in a broadway production of ""James Joyce the dead"" a few years ago, and low and behold, bumped into Matthew Broderick and his wife. Not only were the two of them in the film production of Biloxi Blues together, but had performed the play together on Broadway as well.This was about 5 years ago, and I was thrilled to see the two of them were still friends. Great movie, fantastic play."
4,"Book or movie, take your pick; both are stellar","Neil Simon's 'Eugene Morris Jerome' plays never fail to make me laugh no matter how many times I see/read them. He's got his finger on the pulse of true comedy, and it's treatment in this film is quite worthy.Although the whole cast is great, Matthew Broderick does a fine job portraying Eugene; just the right amount of incredulousness and irreverence to do the character justice. But he also carries the few bits of drama without many problems, so for any actor to handle comedy and drama with such flair is commendable.Christopher Walken as the sadistic Sgt. Toomey steals the show, however, proving he's not just a bad guy in films... he's also a very FUNNY bad guy, with unerring comedic timing, that unfortunately doesn't get shown often enough."
4,Part 2 of 3,"Neil Simon's second in a trilogy of autobiographical plays/movies (BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS was the first), this is set in an Army boot camp in Biloxi, Mississippi, during WW II. The typical cast of barracks boys is presented: a crazy sergeant, a bigoted tough guy, a highly principled Jew, etc. They joke around, fight, visit a whorehouse, etc. The vignette-like scenes are stagey and for the most part sentimental and nostalgic, but many of them work okay. Matthew Broderick plays the main character and does an excellent job. Warm humor seen through the filter of time is striven for here rather than the comic punch Simon got elsewhere. Worth a peek."
5,Major Entertainment Value,"I had never seen Biloxi Blues, but was searching for a great movie. It contained everything a person seeks in a film; though not necessarily realizing they're looking for it until they see it... I thought Christopher Walken, Matthew Broderick, and Corey Parker created many comedic moments requiring stitches; meanwhile rendering the film content an epic drama. I would recommend this film to anybody looking for great entertainment value."
4,Christopher Walken at his best,"Although not the intended star of this movie, Christopher Walken gives what I think is his best performance in this film. He plays a disturbed drill sergeant. Well worth viewing."
5,A must for army veterans,"This film was based on the play by Neil Simon. Long before becoming Sarah Jessica Parker's husband,Matthew Broderick would play one of the young armymen,who of course is looking for love. This film was set in the World War 2 era."
4,a better jackson album,surprisingly!!!....this is by far one of the better jackson albums of all the brother's and sister's....only mike's off the wall and thriller are better.....had he gotten more radio play and exposure he'd be right up there with the other two....lol
4,Fantastic album,"I picked this album up on the strength of Love You Honey and Perpetrators which was getting major BET play on Video Soul with Donnie Simpson. This unit was tight and funky. A&M didn't promote this album like it should have. In 1989 A&M put their eggs in the basket of another Jackson who had a little album entitled Rhythm Nation:1814. But if you want an album that personified the sound of that era (only funkier), then this is a must have."
4,Recommended.,Great sampling of underground russian electronic/IDM. Kmsh by EU is worth the price of admission alone. Can't overstate that enough....download that track and thank me later.
1,POS,"Hooked up my cable and internet to the splitter, turned on the TV. Both went off, traced it back to the splitter which drastically degraded the signal to the point of both not being able to operate. The degradation was apparent on the cable TV without the internet plugged in. I realized maybe I went too cheap with this splitter, seems to be held together by glue in the back, most splitters also have the degradation numbers on the back but this has no markings but RCA on the front."
1,Very weak reception into DVR,"We bought this to split the cable so that we could have cable into the HDTV and cable into the DVR. Didn't work. The splitter causes very low/poor reception into the DVR, so bad that we lost reception entirely on many channels and others were pixelized (reception dropped from 70ish to 25ish, for those who know what that means). Maybe this splitter is good for some applications, but it did not work to split cable between HDTV and DVR."
1,Terrible splitter,"It is the worst splitter ever, it seems could work. And I get terrible TV signal when I connected is with TV cable and modem. My advise , do not buy it . It just weast time and money."
4,Works as intended,"I use this device to split the cable signal between my TV tuner, and a Comcast digital-to-analog converter.It has been working as intended for the past few months."
1,Not as good as others,I do not recommend this item. I replaced a very old splitter to improve the signal to my TV and cable modem. The signal was worse with this problem. There are better options.
4,Seems to work,Seems to be getting the job done fine. It's being used to split our cable input to computer modem and HDTV.
5,Great value splitter,"This splitter was perfect for separating signal to my cable modem and tv. I tried to buy a 2-way splitter at Radio Shack, and they wanted to charge me $10-$20 for one. This was purchased and received within 3 days."
4,Exactly what I needed!,"Exactly what I needed, shipped fast, and works as advertised.I was in need of a basic cable splitter to connect another outlet in my home. Afer going to several well known stores around town, I found several overpriced splitters. I found this on Amazon, and ordered it based off the great price. It arrived very quickly, less than 3 days I believe.The pretty gold finish doesn't look very durable, but for 2 bucks it is not an issue.My advice, check Amazon first for basic electronics needs. Nobody in town can beat them on value."
5,RCA two way signal splitter,"Not two sure how to use or describe a signal splitter that worked in 20 words, but it got the job done. And I have no complants"
1,don't waste your time or $,"I got this to split my internet/cable tv. It kind of works, but only one at a time! If the TV is on, the internet won't work! It should say that in the description or something."
2,Not working,"While the service is pretty fast, the product itself is not working. Only one output is working. The signal of the other output is very weak (either image in TV screen is flash or nothing at all in TV screen)."
2,Poor Quality,I bought this and was excited to use it/set up my ideal entertainment system. Simply put one side worked great and the other side didn't. I would classify it as broken out of the box. I can't complain too much since this was dirt cheap but it is always a let down when you buy something that comes to you broken.
1,Only good for Off-Air,"This is a 500 mhz splitter. If you have anything other than off-air, do not use this...For the money, you can still get a better one (and at a lower price). The two way DIRECTV SWM splitters are the best splitters available (4 way / 8 way too). They have the lowest DB loss, and work with all frequencies for CATV AND DTV. This is especially true if you have a DOCSIS 3 modem; which would provide any internet speed faster than 10 mbps.DirecTv MSPLIT2R1 Approved Zinwell 2-Way Wide Band SWM Splitter- Link to DTV SWM Splitter"
5,EXCELLENT,IT WORKS GREAT AND HAS EXCELLENT QUALITY AND SIGNAL. AND I AM VERY PLEASED AND SATISFIED WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SPLITTER.
3,"More Grit, Please","I didn't see any marketing for Quid Pro Quo but the sense I get is that it suggested more sexiness than storyline...that would be consistent with what I saw in the film.Beautifully shot and lovingly-made, QPQ needed a Cronenberg/Lynch/King injection to provide a creepier edge to push it up to 4 stars. Nick Stahl of Carnival did his part and Vera Farmiga was much more than eye-candy with her twisted performance. For a real treat, watch her audition in the Special Features and see her emote without all the trappings of the set - smokin'!!!"
4,"Compelling, unique premise","A very interesting and somewhat unique concept/subject. Very thought provoking and at times a little unnerving. Definetly a movie I am glad I own and have in my collection. Would definetly recommend to someone who wants something Hollywood, but different."
3,Sterling silver,The ring is beautiful unless the difference betwenn the pictures and the true one. it arrived quickly!its a nice ring but be sure to get the right size! mine was too small. the rim digs into your skin. you might even want a size bigger than you usually get.
3,pretty,its a nice ring but be sure to get the right size! mine was too small. the rim digs into your skin. you might even want a size bigger than you usually get.
4,a golden oldies selection,"This is an essentials album from Luke Vibert just released on the Lo Recordings Lable.The following quoted from Wagon-christ.comArtists include: Richard DeMaria, Eddie Warner, Midas Touch, Roger Roger, Boneschi Electric Combo, Nino Nardini, Georges Teperino, Peter Bonello, Anthony King, Heinz Funk Electric Combo, Cecil Leuter, The Johanna Group, Fred Weinberg, David Holland, Jack Arel.""28 ultra rare 70s library tracks compiled by Like Vibert. Weird, deep fried warp funk and primitive techno that was ahead of its time."""
1,box open and used,the box was open and it looked old and the bottle was half empty. this was a bad buy for me because i paid for a new product
3,"It's OK, but not my favorite","I purchased this bottle because I was so impressed by another Valenti scent, Rose Noire Absolue, which is lovely. However, I didn't like it as much as the absolue. It's ok to have on hand I guess just to have a hint of fragrance; but it isn't as pleasant as other rose scents that I've tried like the Rose Noire Absolue, now that's a winner in my book."
1,Not functional,"The product arrived, but must have been damaged in shipping (that or it is just faulty). The perfume spray cap doesn't work so I can't use it! I'm disappointed because I really wanted to try this out. Also, Amazon doesn't take returns on flammable items so be warned! :s"
4,Excellent Cold War story!,"Clint Eastwood is Mitchell Gant, an aging Vietnam War veteran with a stress disorder. He's retired and lives in Canada, trying to cope with the trauma of the war.It's the height of the Cold War and Gant is the best choice for a dangerous espionage mission. The Russians have developed a Mach-5 supersonic warplane.As former leader of the Agressor Squadron and fluent in the Russian language and culture, Gant has to infiltrate in enemy territory to steal the ultimate weapon; the Firefox.What I like about this movie is the fact that it manages to make a very far-fetched story believable. The movie slowly builds from an espionage movie to the moment that Gant gets to the plane. From then the theme is switched to action and for a 1982 movie I think it looks very polished. Excellent job!"
3,Fun Fun Fun,"One of those movies I wish I'd seen at aged 12 on a Saturday afternoon after the serial and cartoon. Even so, great fun despite some slow bits. A case of let your self go and go along for the ride. Haven't YOU ever dreamt about stealing a jet fighter and going for the ride of your life?"
4,Classic Eastwood,"good movie if your into the 1980's style spy / cold war drama/action thriller, a must for a eastwood collector"
4,movie preview,"Clint Eastwood was a great choice for the lead role in this movie. His emotional flashbacks add a nice touch to the suspense surrounding his effort to sneak into Russia and steal a high-tech airplane. While the airplane is an interesting focal point, I enjoyed more following the logistics and complications the intelligence service had to confront to get Clint to the airplane and then out of Russia.. Good entertainment, particularly for spy fans."
3,Good movie for those on a tight budget,"If you like 70-80's flicks, and relish an inexpensive movie, this is a great buy.Made in 1982 with Clint Eastwood as star and director. Filled with the typical Soviet Era images: oppressive government forces, secret police constantly asking ""where are your papers"" and Jewish scientist forced to work on secret projectsClint Easwood plays a troubled Vietnam Era veteran suffering from flashbacks (I hate that cliche) who speaks fluent Russian and is an experienced fighter pilot. He is pulled from retirement to steal the FIREFOX, a top secret Russian fighter plane that is more advanced than anything in NATO's arsenal.The action sequences are a bit dated, but the plane is definitely cool. For the most part, they used good props. Makarov pistols and AK-47's are the standard weapons. At least they got that part right.Overall, not a bad movie for $5. Worth watching if you are interested in pop culture of the Cold War Era."
3,Firefail,As a kid I remember there being more action and more Airplane dogfighting. The movie is about 40 minutes too long but still enjoyable.
5,"Clint does it again, even suffering PTSD","For some reason I cannot quite put a finger on, this movie is a must-see, and a valuable addition to ""movies of depth and character"" that should be on your list.Clint Eastwood, far from his very apparent physical limitations, yet just as strong as his spirited good will, as seen by his role in ""Gran Torino"", manages to grip us to his side and pray for a good outcome, in FireFox.The movie seems slow-going, yet...it has that magic that will make you watch it at LEAST 10 times, if not more...simply because the climax and ""dénouement"" make it SO WORTH the while.You have to watch it through one time before you are hopelessly and helplessly hooked to watching it again, and again...and again."
2,nice bit part for Ken Colley,"I don't give a rap for Clint Eastwood, who is his usual wooden self in this boy's toys shoot-em-up. The actor I like is Kenneth Colley, and he walks away with all his scenes as a KGB man who almost catches the Yank. Colley is a really fine actor."
1,It was pretty dull.,Sometimes there is an occasional explosion but thats about it.This movie is NOT a good example of an Eastwood movie.We did fast foward quite a bit so it might of been a bit more interesting but probably not.The gun sound effects weren't very good.Clint Eastwoods cool but this is probably one of his worst movies.
3,Great story suffers from poor FX.,Cold war tensions somewhat lost in today's society but still a terrific suspense ride for Eastwood fans. If there was ever a candidate for re-tooling and re-release this is it and I'd pay green money to see it. The special effects are laughable by current standards and are distracting from what is otherwise a pretty good flick. 3 Passports
4,Why no DVD?,"After recently buying the VHS version of the movie, I knew I was buying a good movie, but I had forgotten how brilliant it was.Although it is predictable to a certain degree, the way the plot and action unfolds keeps you thoroughly entertained. Clint Eastwood does well in a role that is out of character for him - someone who has to follow orders to the T. The only downside to the movie is the dated special effects. But the music which is used when we first see the 'Firefox' makes up for it by giving the plane a menacing character.A final word to Warner Bros - judging by the quality - or lack of it - released on DVD from the same period, I cannot see why you guys have not launched a DVD. We are missing it out here."
5,A cult!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies! Great suspence, great characters... and the final part is simply incredible! Do you remember the moment when our hero saw the Mig 31 (it seems part Mig25 and part SR71!) for the first time in the hangar? It was a shock for me! And I hope you remember also the great videogame (lasergame) based on the movie... A cult!!!"
4,One of the best Cold War films ever made.,I saw this film on HBO and I was immediately amazed by it. I really enjoyed this movie. The effects were impressive and Clint Eastwood's performance in this film was also a good one. I hope that Warner Bros. releases this film on DVD.
3,Clint's Offbeat Spy Thriller,"Overlong but satisfying techno-thriller from Clint Eastwood - an unusual change of pace for the actor-director. ""Firefox"" (1982) benefits from a strong supporting cast and John Dykstra's impressive visual effects. Relatively humorless by Eastwood standards, yet great fun when it takes flight. Classic dialogue: ""Think in Russian."""
4,Firefox,"Like the video very well, have enjoyed buying products from Amazon over the years. Plus I like collecting these old movies."
5,Firefox,This is one of the best movies that Clint Eastwood has ever starred in. The plot is pretty obvious but the avenues that Eastwood has to take to complete his assignment successfully creates intrigue and suspense. Great Movie!
3,firefox,"it was a little slow for a clint eastwood movie , but it did pick up some excitement later in the movie"
2,"OK movie, better book","This is a movie that I did enjoy when I watched it several times back in the 80's. Now, I feel a little different. The character development was nice, but not as good as in the book. The action is good, but some of the speical effects were (even for 1982 standards) so-so. The pan- and-scan does not do justice at all, and the planes look terribly out of proportion. The takeoffs that we see (off of both ""runways"") are poor at the end.If you've read the book, don't watch the movie. If you've seen the movie, read the book. Even though you've seen the ending, you'll enjoy the ride much more. If you haven't done either, watch the movie first. And whatever you do, read the sequel, Firefox Down! That dogfight didn't go as well as you had hoped...."
4,Still a good action movie,"Considering that this movie is dated to before the fall of the Soviet empire and involves a ""state of the art"" plane, it is still a very good action thriller. A must have for any Eastwood fan."
1,Firefox,"Firefox is a low class movie with not nearly as much action as some of Clint's big hit's example: the good the bad and the ugly,and dirty harry or maybe your to old for that kind of stuff smarten up Clint."
1,One of my two least favorite movies,"I saw this movie in the theatre and was so incredibly bored with it, that I walked out. I've only done that with two movies...and I've sat through some terrible movies!What a waste of time. It gets a star because it helps if you suffer from insomnia."
2,Fun Propoganda....with some gaping holes,"I was rather surprised that Clint Eastwood would be involved in such propoganda. That aside, it did make for a suspenseful story...with a couple of really obvious missteps:1. Why was Gant SO easily persuaded to go along with the mission. I expected at least a half hour or so of rebellion on the part of this ex-Air Force pilot. Instead, he gave in almost instantaneously.2. Has anyone ever seen the sun come out so fast as it did after Gant pulled the plane from the hangar? Wasn't it supposed to be the middle of the night? All of a sudden, the sun was out when the plane took off. I've seen this kind of screw-up before...I remember seeing it once on the ""Adam-12"" television show....but never in a major motion picture.I can't comment as to the reality of the planes, etc., because I am not familiar enough. But if they can't get night and day straight, I have to wonder if ANY thought was put into reality."
3,Whining depression in Heian Japan,"I found the author to be a whining depressing mess. She spend half of her time moaning about how miserable she is because her husband doesn't pay any attention to her, a quarter of her time snidely gossiping about her husband's other women and the other quarter of her time she's gloating about whatever ""great"" poem she's recently penned.This is the second book I've read from Heian Japan. I found Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book to be a much more engaging read."
2,One or two good songs,Your better off buying a few of BK's songs off iTunes then buying the whole album. There is a reason this guy has failed to make it big in the united states.
4,Bounty Killer is Back!,This album is amazing. He brings a collection of traditions roots rock vibes along with some of the best dancehall tracks I have heard in a while. His sounds are raw and his message is clear. . .Jamacia infrastructure is in disarray and their children are suffering and their only outlet is in a life of crime and drugs. If you are looking for some great music with a strong message this album is for you. This album is not for the faint hearted its beat are hard and raw . . . just the way I like it.
4,Bounty keeping his originality,"Collections from great artists are always great, and Bounty Killer is great. The song 'look' was played a lot around 2000 and I never heared it again until I bought this album, it reminds me of my days when I was a Student. For me this album is for collectors, it is one that one wouldn't want to loose.other songs that i like the most are; Fitness, smoke clears. I cant write them all hear, i'd endup writting close to all the tracks.It's a classic"
2,Xbox extension cables,"The cable extensions were unreliable, since the connection points (with the controller) fit sloppy and connectivity is easily lost. One cable fails more than it works. Poor quality."
1,Wrong cables DO NOT BUY!,"Not only are they hdmi cables and not xbox extension cables for controllers (as is evidence by the primary picture), they were sent without information and in a garbage bag. Also, they do not even function as hdmi extenders. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Will not last...,Bought 2 of these devices.Both just went dead in 7 months...Save your money and look elsewhere.
4,Still charging after a full charge,"After reading the reviews, just bought the charger. The first charge took about 3 hours, then the led turned green. I accidentally disconnected the power, when I plug it again, the led turns orange, and start charging again. Will this hurt the battery?"
4,Great but wait...,"These are very good batteries and I like the charger because it is compact and quick (3 hrs). However, I just learned that Monster just released the ULTRA 2000 POWER PACK which are 2000mAh batteries! 4 Power Pack (4 batteries + charger) is retailing for fifty bucks and 4 batteries are retailing for thirty bucks."
2,Long term update: charger doesn't last!,"I got this charger over a year ago. Took it on several of my trips. Couple of days ago I found the cover is a little loose, even though all the screws holding the covers were okay. Then I realized what had happened. The cheap plastic screw post were broken under the screws pressure over the year. If they used brass posts, it would never happen. Now the charger still works, but it is held together with wire tie because all four posts are broken."
1,"DON'T BUY: doesn't work right, replacement doesn't either","The charger unit or the batteries (or both) don't work right: I use the batteries one at a time, in rotation to power my Zen MP3 player. Sometimes I put discharged batteries in the charger, plug it in, the light blinks red, then goes off. Only supposed to show either red (discharged, charging) or green (fully charged.) This morning 3 batteries show fully charged, I take one out, it is discharged. All these problems happened with a first unit, I returned it to Monster and after they took their sweet time, got a replacement which works just as erratically. Monster's stuff looks good, but it is the last time I am going to buy their brand."
5,Great Expandable Switch,"This is a great unit that provides most of the features of a managed switch at a low price. The stackable function however is top notch. Stacking units with a HDMI cable is a pretty smart way to do it, making it quite cheap for additional capacity requirements. I've had one of these running for quite some time, using LACP and other advanced functions."
1,Not so smart.,"Bought 3 had a network admin friend help setup. Kept dropping workstations, tech support said to upgrade firmware, did that no help. One of the bunch is bad, too much trouble. Bought 3 dumb gigabit switches work perfect out of the box."
3,amusing but not that great,"it seems to me like Lucky McKee was trying to write a film for the general horror audience. the story isn't that original but I do think the characters are written better than a lot of other movies. either way, it's still fun to watch. I didn't care for it much, compared to May or Sick Girl, but then again, all three of these films are in completely different categories. Lucky seems to be able to write movies that definately stand on their own, so I do give him credit for that. It's worth checking out for sure, but I do thibk Lucky has and will offer better things to the horror genre."
5,I was suprised!,"Loved it! What a unique storyline. Watch this one before you send your daughter to boarding school, unless you NEED to send your daughter to boarding school; Great supernatural thriller with no garbage gore."
3,Roots manoeuvre,"David Ross's script is somewhat muddled and unfocussed. It also takes a long time to ramp up the tension. The first 3/4 of the movie has a uniform pacing that seems to be taking the viewer nowhere in particular. Then, in the last 15 minutes, all hell breaks loose in a finale that doesn't sit comfortably with what's gone before. That said the movie looks good, it's nicely played by all the cast, and, although not especially atmospheric, it does have its creepy moments. This is worth watching but it fails to fulfil its promise."
3,Interesting concepts bad follow through.,"This is a very mixed up review, because the movie had good acting, and the stars were trying there best, the story just didnt work, perhaps not enough action to start with?"
3,"Plods along, but is an entertaining diversion...","Lucky McKee (May) has created an atmospheric chiller with ""The Woods"". There are no rapid-fire scares in this film, but what it lacks in shock value, it makes up for with mood and creepiness. The film is well-acted and features Bruce Campbell in a somewhat benign role, but may be worth a gander for die-hard fans of his work. Rachel Nichols (P2 (Widescreen Edition)) does a great turn as a bully to the protagonist. Ultimately, this smacks of ""The Craft"", yet it is set in the 60's. Check it out if you think an all-girls school tucked off the beaten path surrounded by supernatural woods makes for chilling entertainment."
2,Good acting...but disappointing,"The writer's lost something in the story when this was written. It is acted good, but comes across as dull and lacking information as to why things are as they are at the boarding school. The ""ceremony"" at the end has no real explanation for it occuring, other than to have some special effects tossed in.This is one if you can see it for free, watch it, but don't plunk your bucks down."
2,sucks,"the production was the only reason i gave it a 2. the movie overall is pretty borin until the end, which is ok i guess. There isnt really anything eerie or creepy throughout the entire movie. and the branchs going around flipping cars and killing people is stupid, to say the least.if you want to watch a good witch movie, just go watch suspiria and dont waste your time with this one."
2,Was Patricia Clarkson THAT desperate for work?,"Did Patricia Clarkson owe someone a favour to do such a crappy piece of schlocketeria? She, as Miss Traverse, was eerily creepy along with all of her other sod-faced teachers, but honestly this film had no tension or suspense whatsoever! And Bruce Campbell? Bruce oh Bruce oh Bruce....WHY???? Money is tight for all of us.Treat yourself to a Grande at Starbucks.You will have spent wisely!"
1,I miss May.,"Okay, I'm not sure I saw the same film as the rest of you Austin cats did. The one I saw was slow almost tedious with the pacing. The characters were pretty much one-dimensional. It was pretty much all formula and predictable, sure it 'looked' great, but I needed more then that.Another reviewer commented on how bad the DVD is-he's right. But, don't blame Lucky for that, it was pretty obivous that McKee had no control over the finished product.There's no reason to see this unless you're a die hard Bruce Campbell fan."
2,i dont really know about this...,"lately im getting bored with most of the movies that come out, ot it's me that im losing the charm for watching movies... and it more into the first one...i bought this one, 'cause i thought it was gonna be great. good critics, good reviews.i finally watched it. and i thought it was some slasher film. some kinda that... and i was totally wrong... some witch movie that i hated...i could rate it less, but well i'll give it a second chance tonight."
2,Yawn!!,"Since my husband and I watch a movie almost every night (yes, we have no lives), I thought from now on I'd include his thoughts as well.Wife (me): While I thought this movie started out well enough and I liked the premise as well as the setting,the story never really went anywhere. I really liked Patricia Clarkson in ""Pieces of April,"" so I was expecting a bit more. Not a very good movie and I would not recommend it to my family or friends. There are too many movies of this genre to waste any time or money on this. It went downhill really fast in the last thirty minutes. I give it two stars.Husband: I made fun of the movie the entire time it was on (yawn sound effects, rolling my eyes,etc.). The whole ""girl's school"" thing sounded ""interesting"" to me, but ten minutes into it I was asking my wife how, with thousands of movies to choose from, does she manage to find these ""gems."" No, no, a thousand times no!! One star, men will hate this movie."
3,Better than you'd expect...,"Like the previous reviewer, I was able to catch this at Fantastic Fest in Austin. It's a solid horror film, certainly one that rises above its direct-to-DVD status. There is an especially good performance by Patricia Clarkson, and the rest of the cast does fine. The only real caveat is that the movie isn't particularly ""scary"" in the classic sense. It's more of a dark dramedy really, with a strong sense of dread throughout."
3,"A Really Tame ""Suspiria"" with a pinch of ""The Craft""","The biggest question I have about ""The Woods"" is why is it rated R?? There is very little gore, no nudity or language, it seems the target audience for this flick would be teenage girls, so I'm not sure why the Adult rating? Outside of that, ""The Woods"" isn't a bad little movie. I won't dive into the specifics as I hate throwing out spoilers. I had no idea what this film was about, and enjoyed just letting it unfold. I was kind of hoping for a ""Nerd-Out-For-Revenge"" flick like ""Evilspeak"", ""Ginger Snaps"" or ""The Craft"", but unfortunately ""The Woods"" doesn't really fit this catagory. Another reviewer likens ""The Woods"" to those 1970's supernatural horror flick, and I fully agree, only ""The Woods"" has more production value.Should you buy this movie? I don't know if I recommend a purchase, but you could do a lot worse than popping this into you Netflix account."
2,Not for Thinkpad R50p,"This may be the perfect adapter for other Thinkpads, but on the R50p, a 1/4"" gap remains in the Ultrabay and the hard drive bounces around. This is not IBM part no. 62P4554 as Amazon would have you believe!"
3,Keep that teflon pan too,"I first became interested in Sitram's technology two years ago by way of an industrial technology article. I patiently waited for the price to come down and eventually ordered the 11"" Frypan w/ Cover in Dec 2003. My expectations for its nonstick properties were too high. Following the use instructions precisely, I discovered its nonstick properties to be far far less that those of my main nonstick pan, a nearly worn out 11"" Berndes. Do not get this pan for omeletes. Contrary to Sitram's graphic advertising, be prepared for an experience much closer to that of a good metal pan than a below average well-worn teflon pan.On the up side, it is easy to clean, virtually scratch-proof, can be heated hotter than you would ever have need to, and is residue-free and beautiful.I still think this pan is worth the price. I only want the reader to know they will still be using that teflon pan as well."

4,Good choice for 8+ years,"My two girls (8 & 10) play this a fair bit (almost as much as Mario Party). Doing wheelies everywhere on the bike is a favorite. Some of the mini-games are initially ""too hard"", but eventually they get through them, and are very pleased with themselves.It has exploration, collection, cooking, slapstick, and puzzles. You have to ""get past"" the milk-squirting imagery, and the fact that both genders have udders, but that was inherited from the movie itself. It works best to use the nunchuck, but there is a wii-mote only option."
1,Cloud's Legacy,"Cloud's Legacy includes four poorly made horses. Within minutes two of the lower legs of Cloud's broke off. The others are made of the same cheap, flimsy plastic material too. I am saddened and disappointed because this was a gift to my grandaughter. I contacted the vendor and they said they would send me a return label and a credit for my purchase if I took back my review. I do not like the way they do business.The holiday gift giving season is approaching. Please do not by these horses as a gift. I do not believe that mine was the only one that was defective. They were made very cheaply in China. That must be why the horses legs fell apart."
2,not so thrilled,the baby grey horse is nothing like the picture it shows of him by himself. they are like the group picture so we were disapointed. the paint on the yellow horse is a bit too yellow for a real horse. not the nest breyer horses to get!!
2,"horses, but be careful or they will get broken legs easily","These horses are expensive, relatively. They are DARLING.......butI would think if you bought these, you could PLAY with them, maybe carefully, but nonetheless, play with them.I am quite afraid that the legs will break in no time.I bought another set of these BREYER horses, smaller, and the FIRST time my granddaughter touched them, and she was very careful, the leg broke, snapped right off.Of course, I am sure they are from CHINA. When will mfrs. come back to the USA and make something of quality.MADE IN CHINA translates into MADE OF JUNK.........Very disappointing. BREYERS was always a good company."
4,"Careful, unbiased reasoning with clear explanations","The author has carefully laid out the case for the truth of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The argument is clear, unemotional, and backed by a great deal of evidence presented simply. As the author points out, not everyone has the gift of faith; some people need more help to believe, and she has shared the results of her own search in order to help them in their own investigation."
1,Read this before buying this book,"I spent many years in the Christian world and have much experience with the rationalizing that is typically passed off as reason. Ultimately, the only reasonable faith is the faith that admits to its unreasonableness. One must then grapple with the question of delusion. This review exposes the same old thing in this book.[...]"
2,Interesting but Fatally Flawed,"I was surprised that a prestigious attorney could present arguments so flawed that a layman like myself could pick them out on a quick reading. The very concept itself is inadequate, since in any trial there is a defense and a prosecution. Be prepared to hear nothing but a defense argument here. This book will be an appreciated gift for your Christian friend or family member. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,be careful,"Be careful the wording of this item. The price it is selling here is only for 1 flute glass, not for 6. So the ""set of 6"" is definitely misleading and there is no picture of this item. I definitely will return the item. The quality is not extraordinary great."
2,So so glass,"Ordered this item when it was advertised as a set of 6 for 6.99.Received a single glass (of just OK quality, nothing to write home about - hence the very low price).Called Cust Svc for explanation of where the other 5 were. Was told they would let me know in a few days.Received an email that same evening explaining that there was no other solution other than to pay for the single glass (at a cost of 6.99, not 1/6th of that cost) or send it back for a refund. No other equivalent item was offered as a substitute.Typical bait and switch tactics...not a normal thing for Amazon, but BUYER BEWARE! It seems even THEY are capable of it!"
5,Highly recommended!,"Roxanne St. Claire's first book, TROPICAL GETAWAY, was so good I wondered how she could top it. Wow! Now I know! FRENCH TWIST has plenty of exciting action and heart-pounding suspense that had me holding my breath. There are also tender, heartfelt personal moments that brought tears to my eyes. And the characters' dry, intelligent humor made me laugh out loud. The setting is gorgeous, and the author made me feel like I was *right there*, racing across France with Janine and Luc. Janine is smart and bold. Luc is *very* sexy, and a real hero. Their attraction is believable and red-hot. All that--plus the writing itself is great, too! IMO, this book succeeds on every level. You can bet I'll be collecting the three other 2004 books from Roxanne St. Claire. She's now an auto-buy for me."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I was not overly impressed with this book, and even thought it only took me a day to read I can usually finish a book in half a day. The only thing I really like about this book was the hero, he had no regret for the life he choose only losing his faimly in the process. I do wonder if there will be a sequel and if so I read it. The story line was a common with nothign new, except maybe the heroine leaving the hero. I felt the story moved to fast and just skimming some surfaces and going in depth where it was not needed."
4,A little vintage St. Claire,"I discovered Roxanne St. Claire fairly recently - about a year ago. Immediately captivated by her Bullet Catchers series, I raced on to gobble up her three latest Romantic suspenses - The Guardian Angelino series. Hungry for more, I decided to try one of her older books and French Twist didn't disappoint. Well crafted with excellent characterizations, well researched European locations and a nicely twisted storyline, the book had me hooked from the first page. Has Ms. St. Claire improved since French Twist debuted? Indeed she has, but what is more impressive is how well she wrote earlier in her career. If, like me, you've read all of her more recent novels, don't hesitate pick French Twist up - and enjoy some vintage St. Claire."
1,Not much of a lock,"I installed this unit only to find out that if you pull with any force the tailgate will still open. I am not talking about really working hard to pop it, if you pull the handle it will open. I thought this would disable the handle when locked (like a car door handle) not try to block it from opening. I am very disappointed in this and I think for the price it could have been built to be more secure. If you are willing to modify it like I plan on doing it will be a little better and since this is the only product of it's kind I don't have much choice."
3,Good... But...,Another suspense novel from the genre's master. Unfortunately this book can not be considered as one of his best works...The crew of a navy ship are sudenly faced with two disasters: A burning yacht and a crashed airplane... The story gets more and more intense as the connection between the two events becomes clear. The story evolves on into an international espionage setting. The end is very untypical to macLean and is quite surprising.
4,Good price,I give 4 out of 5 because the USC logo graphic is just painted on the pullover shirt. If it was sew on it would be great. However this is an excellent buy for the price. Cheaper than buying it on the bookstore.
1,Not very happy,"It has some nice neat drum patterns but programming it is impossible. Adding a bass line and being able to review your work or do an edit without totally going up the wall is also impossible! I don't know who they used to write the software but they certainly were not musicians or from this planet for that matter! Save yourself the angst...try another product, or better yet, buy mine! It's for sale!"
5,AWESOME AND THEN SOME,"I read one of the negative reviews and at first was not going to buy this machine. Then I thought how much of a geek I can be and said what the heck. Glad I done that because this machine is incredible. It has every feature you can think of and it can do anything. Programming it was very easy if you read the manual and the preset beats are nice too. Funny thing happen when I was purchasing it, the salesmen said not many people buy these machines anymore, they buy the drum software instead. Well I guess I'm sticking to the basics... Great Drum Machine..."
4,Best drum machine I've used,I have had a pile of drum machines and this one does ALOT. Great natural sound quality and innovative rhythms. The bass lines are basic but make a nice addition to the machine. My son recommended this one...atta boy!
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed w/this. Techniques described seem really elementary (maybe that's why it's a ""For Dummies"" text). Found many of the author's anecdotes of little consequence; his constant mentioning/promotion of the ACT! software (esp. when it's doubtful how prevalent ACT! is vs. Outlook or Notes) product is obnoxious and distracting. More generally, I felt the text strayed from the topic of time management, for example, giving details on sales techniques. That's not to say time management and sales, for example, are mutually exclusive, but I thought he was straying too much too often. Bottom line, I felt like a dummy after reading this book (not just on the topic of time management)."
2,Laughable,"I laughed out loud when listening to this audio book. The author is *employed* by the ACT software people, yet Dummies allowed him to spend at least five minutes of this tape plugging his own product. He even includes contact information! This isn't an audio book, it's an infomercial, and to be charged for it is incredible. As for the time management techniques, many of them are self-evident (clear off your desk, bring a pen to meetings). The best time management trick I can think of is not to listen to this tape."
3,One third of this is a sales pitch!,"I think of this as time management 101. I was reminded of one tip I was currently not doing to effectively manage my time. I have been a bit more functional on a heavy day using this technique. The rest of the book is nothing new to someone who is busy and has survived thus far. I gave this tape to the library, and it has been checked out about six times since April, so someone is getting something out of it."
2,A guide to time management for sales people,"This is an excellent guide for time management in the first 2 chapters. After that the author proves himself an excellent salesman with his ability to sell a book on effective sales techniques as a time management book to the nearly infallible Dummies editorial staff. However, the first two chapters do offer excellent suggestions for saving time"
2,The front cheat sheet is why this book got 2 stars!,"After researching Time Management skills for a recent seminar, I stumbled across this book. What a waste of time.... I just didn't find any consistent information that I would want to share with others regarding Time Management.The author is too unclear about what he does recommend... and then he doesn't stick with the recommendations that he is clear with. He contradicts himself too much. Makes you wonder if anyone ever proofed the book BEFORE it went to press.Also, this book is a bit old now .... but the subject is still relevant. I hope that a new T.M. for Dummies comes out again... but with a different author..... oh, and the only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the cheatsheet at the beginning of the book. The email & voice mail hints are basic and simple common sense...but there are some that never quite get those hints until they are pointed out to them."
2,"Some basic information, but mostly and ad for Act!","I listened to this tape, hoping to get something new out of it. What I really got was annoyed. The frequent proselytizing about Act! was at once a major turn off and a distraction. If you have never read anything about time management then you may find something useful in the most basic sense. I, however, did not find anything new. Better choices would be ""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen and ""Eat that Frog"" by Brian Tracy."
3,A useful book if you overlook the various sales pitches.,"Jeff Mayer presented his time management skills and methods in a useful and practical way. The first five chapters are a ""must read"". However, he pushes a few software programs too much. A chapter on a particular time management software is too much. Since software is continuously replaced and upgraded, this book can be outdated soon."
2,ok/ho-hum...,book was written in 95. i read it in 2005. half of this is on computers in 95. 1/4 of this is good.
4,"""Let It Ride"" Pays Off","A completely ignored little gem of a movie. Perfect, in it's small way. The characters are memorable and there are more genuine Laffs in this movie than most comedies. David Johansson is a surprise, and this is the movie that put Jennifer Tilly's bootay on my Favorites List. Loved the asides and ""spoken thoughts"" too. (""That's a lot of money..."") If you EVER put 2 bucks on a nag, you must see this movie."
5,Trotter's DAY at the Races,"This is a fabulous movie that will keep you laughing from start to finish. Truly Dreyfuss' best work and there is a tremendous supporting cast, Robbie Coltrane, the ticket seller being the best of the bunch. Definately among the best films of the 80's."
4,Looking for laughs?...See this!,"Let it Ride is a very entertaining movie.One I watched more than once! The cast is great, especially Dreyfuss. I'm glad I managed to see this movie in the theater! A definite keeper."
5,The single greatest movie ever created,"I think that this tribute to the sport of kings is a uproariously funny tale of a man down on his luck. The alignment of the planets on a single day can illustrate the joys betting, winning, making new friends, and living life to the fullest in the Jockey Club. Fine performances from Buster Poindexter and Richard Dimitri."
5,A winner!,"Since I am a big fan of Dreyfuss I get all of his movies that have good reviews...so far I have not been disappointed...this one moves a little fast, so I watched it again...the supporting cast was great also."
5,funny flick,"If you like a funny movie you must watch the day this loser gambler has at the track when he was suppose to quit. The cast is very good and some of the best ""1 liner's"" I have heard before!"
3,Pretty Funny,Although this film is far from perfect it still delivers quite a few laughs. The critic in me stops me from giving this four stars but this was nevertheless a pretty enjoyable film. It's fast paced humour and short length allow a thin story to still get pulled off. And if you're a horse racing fan you can't help but love this movie.
3,Let It Ride & What About Bob,"l bought Let it Ride, What About Bob and did not get Boys Town. When l received the movies l could not play them in my recorder or my DVD player which is supposed to play most movies, very disappointing as my daughter in law buys quite a few from you and has not trouble with hers. Regards Barbara"
5,Classic Comedy,"Choc full of racetrack humor, antics anddreams.....a classic comedy and the very best ofRichard Dreyfuss."
4,No Plot At All But....,"No plot whatsoever, a piece of fluff that could not possibly happen in real life - but it's good for entertainment. What more needs to be said?"
5,Let It Ride,"Whether you've been to the track to bet on horses or not, you should find this movie hilarious. Aside from all the superb and subtle performances by Richard Dreyfuss, David Johansen, Jennifer Tilly, Teri Garr and the others, this movie hits the nail right on the head, when it comes to horse track bettors and their non-sensical ways of picking a ""winner"". Of all the great movies Richard Dreyfuss has been in, I think this is one of his finest performances. Unfortunately, comedic roles don't win Oscars."
4,Let It Ride,"Product was packaged very carefully and was sent to me in a timely manner. Plays good, no problems it was everything the seller said it was. It was their description of the product and how they would ship it that made me choose them over over people with the same product."
2,Not 20 oz!,"These glasses actually just barely hold 16 oz. Very disappointed.Other than that they are nice glasses, nice weight, contour feels nice in my hand etc."
2,Ouch!,"The only reason this disc even got 2 stars is because of Donnie's contributions to the disc.If you like sensitive 80's pop, I'd say that this may be a good CD.If it's southern rock you're looking for, with the exception of a few redeeming tracks that Donnie has, this is best left out of your collection!My rating is based on what the band was originally (and again, in the last few years) about."
4,Another turning point! Out with the southern melodies and in with more straight ahead pop and rock.,Another solid album filled with hooks and melodies! But this album marks the change of the southern rock sound and more of a pop and rock 90's sound. It is a good album full of solid material. If you are real 38 special fan I would recommend you add this one to your collection. If you are a casual fan I would start elsewhere with there more classic albums from the 80's. Overall I am happy with and glad this one is in my collection.
5,great,Max Carl (Gronenthal) is the best siner along with Richard Page. Buy the album. Beautiful stuff.
2,What the heck is this?!?!?,"Up until this point, the band had always stayed true to their guitar roots. Even if their songs had an ""80's"" feel to them, they were always guitar rock at their core. Not anymore. With the departure of Don Barnes, and the arrival of Max Carl on Keyboards, their trademark sound was gone. Gone was Barnes's strong guitar and vocals. In was Carl's cheesy, even wimpy, keyboards. I'll give him his due, he is not a bad singer, but he has no edge, no attitude. Simply put, he is not a rocker. Jeff Carlisi and Donnie Van Zant are the only reason this gets 2 stars. Otherwise, it's a 1 star effort. They just didn't sound like 38 Special anymore. They became a pop band. Ronnie was rolling in his grave over this one. How could his brother be a part of something like this?"
5,Offensive... and funny,"Ok so it is about Crazy People, but it treats them as people unlike today where they are ""ill"", I have always enjoyed the story and the premise, what if ads told you the truth?An example: ""Sony, because Caucasians are just too d*** tall"" --- To get the punchline see the movie :-)"
5,Crazy People,"I do love this extremely funny movie. I recommend strongly to watch this when you need a laugh, because you will!"
3,Light laughs,"This isn't a comedy that's hysterically funny, but it is made quite pleasant by Moore (a natural born charmer) and the ads he concocts. Daryl Hannah is better than usual."
3,A one-joke movie - but it's not a bad joke,"Crazy People is a one joke movie, but the joke is given enough amusing variations as a very unwell looking adman Dudley Moore (in a part he took over when mystifying original choice John Malkovich walked out) starts designing honest ad campaigns and finds himself committed to a mental hospital alongside several benignly stereotyped cuckoos (this is NOT an attempt at an accurate portrayal of mental health) only to draw them into his brutal-truth-in-advertising campaign when the concept catches on. Some of the mock ads are great (""Don't go to France. The French are annoying. Come to Greece instead - we're nicer.""), although there is one that falls horribly flat for modern audiences due to events long after its production - in this case a campaign for United Airlines stressing the dangers of flying but adding ""Most of our passengers get there alive.""As usual per Paramount's back-catalogue releases, no extras, just a decent widescreen transfer."
4,WHEN WILL THIS MOVIE BE ON DVD?,"My family has loved this movie for many years. The man who plays ""the hello guy"" must have a name but whenever we see him in anything else, we always say, ""Hey, it's the hello guy!"" Then there's the comment Moore's character makes about the guy on the car phone. Something like ""People who talk on car phones annoy other drivers!"" (As he yanks it out and throws it off the bridge. Priceless!) We do not have this movie in our home inventory and are only buying DVD's these days. Why isn't this movie on DVD yet?? I would definitely purchase it if it were available."
5,finally on dvd!~A true classic~Hilarious,"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it with my parents 15 years ago. My mom and I still sing ""the hello song"". It has become like a family staple. I'm so glad its finally on DvD. I've been waiting for awhile for that! I bought it as soon as I found out it was on dvd. If you haven't seen this movie...do see it. you will be sooo glad you did. This movie is simply hilarious. I love it!!!! and its on dvd now, so no excuses. you can buy it on VHS, DVD, and even LASERDISC if you can find it and still have a player! This movie ROCKS!"
1,Idiocy laced with attempts at pathos,"I can't make up my mind about this movie. After watching it, does it make you want to throw up, or lose all faith in mankind?"
5,"Incantatory, alluring","This book, in such a relatively compact space, unfolds and unfolds itself, into stories within stories within stories. The cast of characters is continually shuffled around in a landscape that is equal parts real and unreal. (Cairo itself IS a major character in the story.) The results are very entertaining, albeit very dark. The Father of Cats, in particular, is a particularly chilling villian. I read this book for a week, and each night I would read it in bed, before I fell asleep. Although I never had any nightmares from reading the book--the experience of my own drowsiness when reading the book reminded me of the central issues in the book. It teeters between the waking world and the dream world, and the book succeeds brilliantly when the two are indistinguishable."
2,unimpressed,"hmmm. it has taken me like 2-3 weeks to get through 125 pages-this is a very slow read. i keep on reading because the idea is very interesting and every once in a while something interesting happens-but for the most part i am freakin bored to death with this book. maybe it will get better-but maybe i'll just read something else and never find out for sure, yeah, that sounds good-ok, i'm on my way to the book shelf."
2,Arabian Nightmare,"I was drawn to this book by its literary style, but ended up put off by its distanced diction and its lack of character development. Though exotic sensuality is promised, little is really there on the page, and there's almost no action. Nor could I care about the characters, because they were little more than ciphers. I gave up, bored, about halfway through."
3,Ford Rear Brake Line,"Part bolted fine, however the machined fittings seemed like they were not tapered. The brake line ends were basically 'forced' into the brake hose. The Chinese need to revisit their machining strategy."
3,Get the soundtrack please,"I bought this book because I loved the Phillip Glass soundtrack cd for this title. I read about 1o pages, then quit.Go buy the cd!!! the music is the best sounds the third world has to offer you.Then get Kiss Originals. ""I'm 93, she's 16, and I think I'm goin' blind""!!!!! Wa"
5,"OH EDDIE, WHY CAN'T YOU BRING THIS KIND OF FUNNY ANYMORE?!!!",Way ahead of its time in story! The acting phenomonal and the cast.... priceless! What more do you need? Eddie Murphy hasn't had anything close to being this funny since Boomerang. The Donkey character in Shrek gives a small glimpse of his comic genius but he made himself into this kids movie dude and closed the door on himself as one of the most sought after comics in Hollywood. John Landis outdoes himself here as I loved this one even more than his classic Blues Brothers movie! The sets are breathtaking and John Amos is hilarious as the Pops to win over. Arsenio has never been better since and that's a real shame. A true Classic!! A+++!!!
3,Entertaining Movie,"This is an entertaining movie. Not a great comedy, although there are some laughs. It is a very good story about an African Prince coming to America to find a bride because he wants someone to love him for him and not his position or wealth. You want to see what will happen next and how it is going to end. You will enjoy the story, much more than the comedy."

3,Coming to America,"Eddie and Arsenio were funny, I really liked the make up on Eddie playing the white guy."
3,Not for Kids,"I bought this because I had fond memories of certain scenes in the movie... and it is a pretty nice story. I'd forgotten though of some of the scenes in the movie, scenes that aren't appropriate for children. Still, for adults it is an entertaining movie."
5,My all-time favorite comedy,"In ""Coming to America"" (1988) Eddie Murphy plays the likable prince of a rich African kingdom, Akeem. He comes to Queens to find his future queen accompanied by his best friend & servant, Semmi, played by Arsenio Hall. He understandably wants a wife who will love him for who he is and not for his great riches. So they get hired at McDowell's, a McDonald's knock-off, where he meets the shining daughter of the owner (Shari Headley). Is she the one? Will she find a fast-food mop boy appealing enough to marry?As noted in my title blurb, ""Coming to America"" is my all-time favorite comedy. Why? Simply because it's a laugh-riot from beginning to end. The first time I saw it was on TV in 2000 and I couldn't stop laughing; I saw it again last night (after purchasing it) and it had the same effect.Everything works here -- the characters, the jokes, the story -- to make ""Coming to America"" one of the greatest comedies ever made.GRADE: A+"
5,"So Cliche, So Funny!~","I have probably seen this movie a hundred times and I STILL laugh!~ There are so many one-liners for you movie buffs. If you just want to laugh, and are not looking for ""the bottom line"" this is a great movie!~ Language may be a bit strong for young children but over all a good family movie!~"
1,GREAT MOVIE . . . TERRIBLE BLU RAY,"ATTN: THE POOR RATING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE ITSELF. The transfer is HORRIBLE. Really, it's like watching the DVD on a regular projection TV. I own the DVD and can definitively say that there is NO difference between the Blu ray and DVD. That's just terrible and I wish I hadn't spent my money on this release."
4,"EDDIE, EDDIE, EDDIE",I love Eddie and he did not disappoint in this movie. Got a deal from Amazon and always check here before ordering anything.
5,Murphy hit the bullseye with this one!,"This film remains an Eddie Murphy fan favorite and the reasons are many: a great cast, witty writing, fantastic costumes and sets, and astounding make-up combined with the acting skills of Murphy and co-star Arsenio Hall.A treat for the eyes, the ears, and the spirit is this comedy classic."
2,"Not ""Trading Places"", a weak film",I bought this based on over a 100 5* ratings and adoration of Trading Places. I was disappointed. The movie is too weak. There are several scenes that just drag on. But it was ok entertainment; certainly not 5* and not at all comparable to Trading Places or other Murphy masterpieces.
4,bought the wrong thing,"The DVD is ""HD"". It is not formatted for a regular DVD player. Therefore I cannot view it. It appears to be in good condition. I will not make this mistake again!"
1,DISGUSTED! ! !,"Thought this would be a good comedy. Unfortunately, it was NOT as seen on television...a LOT of suggestiveness & nudity! How unfortunate for these actors to sink THAT low, just for a few dollars! Didn't even watch the whole movie; after about 20 minutes my husband & I had had enough! Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,EM has done his thing - it is time to move on,"Eddie Murphy did a few great comedies, truly of genius. Then, once he said what he had to say, he started drfting into roles that he walked through. They singularly lacked inspiration, originality, or energy. This is one of those mediocre films: while they tried to spice it up with the multiple role playing, most of the jokes in this - not to forget the entire plot - fall pretty flat. To make up for the lack of a spark, it just gets more vulger and outlandish.Not recommended, except for devotees."
3,I used to like it......Eddie Needs to Expand His Range,"As if the real beauty of Africa cannot stand on its own, there are some genuinely funny scenes in the movie. But the dead leopard skin on his Tuxedo in the Beginning of the movie and the Palatial Estate was meant to SHOW people how impressive Africa really is? Africa is really dark, humid, dank, dangerous, and it has some very beautiful areas. Being African American I rather be subject to the truth and not a Hollywood Version of What Africa is. As far as realism is concerned (For a Better Perspective of the Motherland) see Out of Africa and When We were Kings. Not all African Women are Subserviant as suggested in this movie."
3,A fairly solid comedy,"I wouldn't say Murphy is at his comedic best here, but you will find a sweet, corny, overall funny flick. Murphy and Hall's several characters will keep the viewer entertained, and the ""barber shop"" sequences are definitely not to miss."
5,YES....YES F*CK YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!!!,"GREAT CAST, GOOD ACTING, ALOT OF LAUGHS, COMING TO AMERICA IS ABOUT A PRINCE OF ZAMOONDA (MURPHY)WHO WELL GUESS, YES HE COMES TO AMERICA TO FIND HIS BRIDE WITH WHOM HE CAN SHARE COMMON INTERESTS WITH AND ACTUALLY FALL IN LOVE, INSTEAD OF AN ARANGED MARRIGE. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS HE IS A PRINCE, AND HE PRETENDS TO BE POOR SO THAT HE CAN ATTRACT THE RIGHT KIND OF WOMEN. HIS EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA, AND HIS DEMEANOR IS HILARIOUS AND HIS BITTER SERVANT ARSENIO HALL IS ALSO ALOT OF LAUGHS."
5,One of Eddie Murphy's best movies,"The story of the son of an African King who travels to Queens, New York to find the girl to marry since he thinks that's where ""Queens"" come from. A wonderful comedy movie."
4,loved this movie,one of the movies in my collection i would want to watch again. some great comedy in this film and some good lines i enjoyed it.
4,One of the classic movies with Eddie Murphy,Not so much to say about the movie. This is one very funny and romantic Eddie Murphy movie and as this HD-DVD has also nice extras and features it is a clear recommendation.
5,Lots of Fun,Classic 80's movie. I'll never get tired watching it. Eddie Murrphy does a wonderful job with all the different characters he plays. Love it.
5,Has all of the Elements!!!,"I love this movie so much that I'm buying the DVD to replace my VHS tape. I watched it again, last weekend and the sound quality was terrible (ON THE VHS!!) so I decided it was time to buy the DVD.This movie touches all of your emotions. It's a love story, it's adventurous, it's funny.....no, hilarious. Eddie Murphy is great in his many roles. He is so very creative.In some past movies, the language was ""slightly out of context and not needed"" in my opinion. Although there is profanity, it fits the characters (stereotypical) to a tee. What else would you expect a Queens barber to say!!!My wife and I thoroughly enjoy this movie. I'll probably have to watch it again when I get my DVD!!! Enjoy"
5,One of the best,"Next to Trading Places this is by far one of Eddie Murphy's best movies. His comedy is so qunique and dynamic which made this movie an instant classic. All of my close friends fell as I do, that this is one fo the best comedies of all time. A must have"
3,An enjoyable smiler,"This is not a great movie, but it will make you smile a lot. The entire film is entertaining and I like the way Eddie Murphy and Arsenio worked together. There is only one boring scene that I Fast Forward through. I like this movie, but only gave it 3 stars, because no one else in the family cares for it. Not enough action for my sons, and the romance is apparently to subtle for my daughters.3 star is for a GOOD movie, not GREAT and not WOW. As enjoyable as i find this movie, it just got knocked out of my top 10 favorite EDDIE MURPHY movies by I Spy."
4,One of the best soulful voices in the business.....,"...I would agree this collection of songs hardly made Brenda Russell a household name but she did put out a great track from this record ""Piano in the dark"" and I did hear that song on the radio for several years after. She may not have the pipes of Whitney Houston but there are very few singers that can melt your heart with their voices and Brenda Russell given the right material and direction can."
4,Brenda Russel,"Beautiful music for under 4 dollars! The cover was used but the CD, itself, was almost new with no scratches whatsoever. Excellent buy!"
5,"Salsa ""POWER ""","Throughout the history of salsa many have come, many have gone. However only one musical organization can claim that they have catapulted the solo career of El Gallo Tito Rojas, and thats no other than Puerto Rican Power. Under the very jealous and detailed leadership of trumpet Master Luisito Ayala, Puerto Rican Power has managed to release some of the best, most influential and solid salsa throughout 3 decades and counting! Want to hear how influential is this band? listen to anything made in Cali Colombia as of late and compare it to their 80's and early 90's hits. This particular album is among the BEST in their long career and has definitely proved that sometimes change is good. Now released by J&N instead of their decade long MP label, PR Power is defining yet another wave of upcoming salseros. ANY of their tracks will definitely be a listening and dancing pleasure to anyone and ALL!"
5,Salsa lovin' gringo,"After two years in Puerto Rico I loved the music and have heard a lot of it. This CD has some of the best. There are a couple of slower songs that are not quite as fun to dance to, but they are still good. I'd recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to some great salsa and dance the night away. Vaya Boricua!"
2,disappointed,"I thought that this CD would have more faster, modern salsa for dancing but it sounds a bit like lift/ supermarket music. I was really looking forward to some great salsa for my dance classes but am quite disappointed."
5,"Much Better than a ""Best Of""","This is not really a ""Best Of"", as the description says. It includes Dave Edmunds' first three albums, plus a few rare singles. The first two are the two albums by ""Love Scupture"", followed by his first solo album, entitled ""Rockpile"", which includes ""I Hear You Knocking"", his biggest hit ever. I don't think this album has ever appeared on any other CD. Unfortunately, one early single is missing, due to a copyright problem, entitled ""River To Another Day"". A very rare instrumental, entitled ""Mars"", is included. Every Dave Edmunds fan must have this CD, but unfortunately, it's a rare item."
3,The Real Thing,"Not for the timid, this is real death. They toss in a few other things, too--such as an actual autopsy and a sex-change operation (male-to-female). It appeals to the morbid desire of some viewers to see what these things really look like."
2,Borring Zzzzzzzz,"Ok, first of all, this movie just flat out sucked, the narrator sounded like he was trying to be scary (which he wasn't), and all they showed were pictures, about three suicides, and a bunch of operations that you could just as easily seen if you were to turn on your T.V., and go to the The Learning Channel (T.L.C.). So over all, if actually want to rent this movie, go ahead! But grab a pillow and be prepared to fall asleep!!!"
2,not that good,"I expected way more than I got in this film. The people who give it such high ratings are the people who have not seen this kind of stuff before. Like (...) pictures of dead people, which is 75 % of the film. The only parts i hadnt seen was this business man shooting himself in the mouth and a man being eaten by Tigers, which I was suspicious of because it was not very clear. So I do not recommend you buy this or any of its volumes. The best shockumentary by far is Banned from Television, which is much clearer and longer and has some seriously sick scenes. As for Traces or Faces of Death, pass on them."
5,Great Price!! Great Fit!!!,Just right for your Honda Accord. Priced much less than dealership parts department. Be smart and buy here!!
4,Not bad,"I really like the scrolling text and graphic equalizer functions. I can even turn the computer on and off with the remote. The remote can also act somewhat like a mouse/keyboard. Only complaint I have is the software that acts somewhat like Windows Media Center....it's not bad, but can be somewhat of a challenge to navigate through."
3,"Good, but pricey.","It works fine, install is pretty easy. The biggest problem is that the IR field seems rather narrow, so if you aren't pointed right at it and close to straight on, the signal may not get seen. I installed this in a Thermaltake case, which has a built-in window. I think if you use the supplied bracked in a 5.25"" slot instead you would probably not have as much of a field issue on the IR.Software is good once you update it."
2,Thin Characters and Plot,"This could have been an interesting movie if the characters were more developed and three-dimensional. Dialogue between the two female leads seemed strained at times. The emphasis was on the sex scenes. So if you're looking for a no-brainer filled with hot, erotic female-female sex, you'll love this movie. If you're looking for something with more of a storyline and developed female characters, check out ""The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls In Love""."
3,"Good Sex, but it doesn't happen that way with us lesbians","Goodbye Emma Jo is about a young women who lost her lover in an accident. This women feels that if she could have stopped her lover from going to the party, her lover would still be alive. Well to make the story short, she has trouble with her car one day while crying on her lover grave site after giving up on the car, she meets the caretaker, who happens to be a very pretty women. This very pretty women helps her out and guess what, the next day they are both in bed and I don't mean sleeping. We KNOW that, That does not happen that fast, well a least for us in the real world it does not. It a nice fastasy moive to see when you are remembering the fight you just had with your lover, all in all it's OK ! LOOK OUT FOR THE SEX SCENES, WOW !!!"
3,"Too short, but very sweet","If most movies are books, this was a short story. While too short for the money, I found the story delightful and the acting very satisfactory. I often tire of movies quickly, so I didn't find the short length objectionable, but many might. I found the erotic scenes just that--erotic without being pornographic. The story was well played out, the acting good and smooth. Altogethter, this a very satisfactory, though very short film, with acting at a much better level than some lesbian flicks I've seen lately."
1,"Plenty of sex, unfortunately all of it predictable.","Basically a lesbian porn movie. Plot and dialogue unbelievable and uninteresting. But planty of sex. Personally I prefer more interesting characters and a more intereting relationship - without either the sex doesn't particularly interest me, however explicitly filmed."
2,Not so lucky ...,I followed the instructions to a T and still had some break-through rust marks. I wish I would have saved my money and bought a better brand.
2,Rust!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I bought a large Phillippe Richard cookware set (4 skillets and 4 pots, 5 lids, baking rack and pan and utensils) and within a year it has developed rust from the ""non-stick"" surface wearing off. I only put the lids in the dishwasher, and I've had no problem with them. I don't scour these pots and pans or use very rough cleaning pads, but the Teflon-wannabe coating on the pieces themselves certainly explains the great deal I got on this set at JCPenney Home Store. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a nicer brand. You'll end up buying new ones before too long anyway when this one rusts."
5,Inexpensive and decent value,"These are definitely not high capacity. Four of them in my 7yr old's HP Photosmart last about 20 flashes. But they are great for the kids' toys, remotes etc."
3,Short Shelf Life,"These batteries have only a 3-year stated shelf life, as opposed to the more common 6-year shelf life for alkalines. This is probably old stock."
1,Worthless,"These batteries are a big disappointment. Use four for my digital camera and were only good for 100 snapshots. Should have lasted for at lease 250. All I got for my trouble is an ""I told you so"" from the wife, since I did not get Duracell's."
5,Great AA's! CHEAP!!,What can I say? Great batteries for a cheap price! Can life get any better? I think not!
3,A Few Surprises,"Jacket was worth the price paid, but there were a few surprises which weakened the quality of the item. They were as follows:1. Color did not match item shown on webpage. Actual jacket was a deeper brown than the item shown on the webpage.2. Lapel buttonhole was a keyhole type which is cheap quality.3. Jacket had no cuff buttons or vents. Again, cheap quality."
1,They DOWNGRADED it NOT to work with Apple OS X 10.5 :(,"First, I've never been a bog fan of HP. I've owned this all-in-one for a few years now and rarely use the scanning feature. Today, when I tried to scan after upgrading to OS X 10.5 Leopard, I couldn't scan. Then I found this on HP's site:""Scanning is no longer supported when using Mac OS v10.5 with the following products: HP PSC 1100 series, HP PSC 1200 series, HP PSC 1310 series, HP PSC 2110 series, HP PSC 2170 series, HP PSC 2200 series, HP PSC 2310 series, HP PSC 2400 series, HP Officejet 4100 series, HP Officejet 4200 series, HP Officejet 5500 series, HP Officejet 6100 series.If the scanning features are necessary, upgrade to an HP product that is fully compatible with Mac OS v10.5.""Nice try. I'm going with Canon or Epson next time."
2,Scanner is absolute junk!,The scanner worked once in the entire 1 year that I had this printer. The drivers are horrible! All it does is display a bunch of blurry horrizontal lines when it scans with some colors from the document you have in the scanner..... and nothing is legible. Don't waste your money.... all this printer is good for is being a semi-decent printer for word processing.
5,good choice,This is a very nice printer/scanner/card reader. I did a bit of research before buying this unit and am very pleased at the results. It does a very nice job for the money. I got it even cheaper in the store.
1,Scheisse,"I use a mac, and I have had nothing but problems with this printer. HP customer service is also useless where this model is concerned. Caveat emptor."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I've found buying printers very frustrating over the years. I had a poor experience years ago with an HP and an equally frustrating time with a Xerox Multifunction more recently. Both were top down and both ate paper. After too many months of feeding one sheet at a time, it was time for a change. Was reluctant to go with an ink jet as I've only bought laser before. Spent months looking and eventually decided on this model vs $... more for the 2210.It's a pleasure. The design is excellent. Scanning, copying and printing are more than acceptable. The machine is suprisingly quiet. For those of you who are on the verge, take the plunge. If you're going to fax frequently, go for the 2210.Congratulations to HP on this vastly improved design."
1,Not for high quality photo scanning,"If you are looking for the convenience of an all-in-one scanner/copier/printer, the HP PSC 2175 might be okay for. If you want to make high quality scans of photos, however, the PSC 2175 will be a big disappointment.No matter what resolution you choose to scan a photo in, it will come out too contrasty and subtle details of the photo will be lost. The colors come out flat and grayish. There is also visible cross-hatching. The software allows you to make adjustments to brightness and contrast, etc., but the interface is clunky and you can't see how your adjustments have affected the photo until you scan it. I cannot recommend this product for people who are primarily intersted in scanning photos.Also, the scanner I purchased (by mail) came with some fogging and dust on the inside of the glass and HP customer ""service"" is a hellish experience (which is only available on weekdays and limited hours on Saturdays)."
1,Stay away from HP,"Hello. I bought this MFC about 1 year ago, before this I owned a PSC 2200. I have had nothing but headaches produced from these terrible machines. The mechanical reliability is O.K, no problems there. Although it will often turn itself off for no reason, it prints about 85% of the time. Wow.The real dilemma is the software bundled with it. It is woeful. It will not allow you to make fundamentals decisions. For example, if you scan a page as a picture, it will automatically cut all that it deems as white space from the edges. Great. Except it is not white space and cuts out valuable information from the scan. Ok, so turn up the DPI. Done. Still does it. And even then only about 50 percent of my scans get through. It causes a windows fault error the other 50%.HP's range of scanners and printers are all absolute pathetic jokes. I am staying away from ALL things HP for the rest of my life and urge you to do the same."
2,Great when it works!,For the moment I am ready to put this out for the garbage guy. Does anyone else seem to have the same problem with theirs. Seems like after we use the photo card and later want to print a word doc. the printer doesn't want to work. I have turned it off and on several times...usually the printer will just click and I shut it off for about an hour...then it will print. Now it just wants to send out blank copies like it's lost it's train of thought. This item was not cheap when we bought it...I guess it's been 3yrs ready for a NEW one!!!Good Luck!!!
3,Good Printer. Bad scanner.,"As a printer, this machine suits my home needs well. It is fast, decent quality, and the ink is fairly inexpensive. My only complaint is that the scanner is very poor, even by flatbed scanning standards. The parallel port Mustek scanner I bought at Wal*Mart five years ago does a better job than the 1275."
1,Don't buy this without a large supply of pain killers!,"Contrary to what some others have said, I have no complaints about the print quality. I frequently use it for multiple copies of photos, with excellent results.What I need large quantities of motrin for are the headaches I get every time it jams. It feeds the paper in unevenly, and then jams trying to print on it. You cannot remove jammed paper from the front. You must turn it around and remove the back panel to take out the paper. It gets expensive wasting photo paper every time you have one come out cockeyed.Also, I usually print two-sided reports, and I keep getting a message that I need a two-sided printing tray - there is no such thing! I checked with HP, and they say there is no such accessory for this model - it's a software glitch."
1,Worst Printer I Have Ever Owned,"I am a graphic designer and have used a wide variety of printers. When my Epson died, I decided to try an HP. This printer sounded wonderful and had some excellent reviews. Unfortunately, none of them were true. The image quality is atrocious, and the scanning is deplorable. It has many capabilities, but doesn't do anything well."
2,It was great while it lasted,I bought this printer just over a year ago...it was great it printed high quality and fast. Then it started with the paper jams...then the ink cartrige jammed...then the cradle jammed and the ribbons that pull the ink across the printer broke. I went to technical support on line they told me I needed an upgrade...as in a new printer...they offered to sell me a referbed upgrade and I could trade my broken one in but no satisfaction there...I used to love HP now I think they are declining in there quality.
2,"terrible software, ok printer","The software, including drivers, is poor. The scanning functionality is especially bad. We were able to live with the software shortcomings. But now after owning the printer for a year the black and white printing stopped working. Did all of the troubleshooting steps I found on-line to no avail. Now I've sunk way too much time into getting it to work again so I will scrap it. I definitely won't get another HP."
3,This book captures the 3rd Doctor era very well.,"Overall the book was fun to read. It really brings out the nostalgia for the Pertwee era in the TV show. The plot, although not very complex, illustrates the Doctor, and his companion Jo wonderfully. The book borrows visually from the film 'Casablanca' and plotwise from the serial 'The Mutants.' It's also pleasant to have a reappearence of an old adversary -- the Draconians..."
3,"Seems Uneven, With Some Very Nice Tracks","I hadn't bought any Getz albums before this one, and these are initial impressions based on two listenings. Good tracks IMHO include: La Fiesta (with Chick Corea), Misty (with Herbie Hancock), Who Cares (ditto), and Blue Serge. I couldn't get behind these renditions of Lester Left Town or Captain Marvel, although I can see where these might have fans. And I don't like the Getz/Gilberto tunes as a rule, just personal preference, so YMMV, but that leaves out the Ligia and Aguas De Marco tracks. Most of the tracks are from the 1970s, with a couple from 1964.Be aware the liner notes are in French!With the above reservations, this is a recommended straight-ahead jazz CD."
3,It's a battery!,The battery is fine. I was disappointed in how long it took to ship. I actually had to go out and buy one before tis battery arrived and I think it was about the same price.
3,You might check....,"Last time I purchased these, they were $1.88 for a two pack at Walmart. Dont know if they still sell 'em."
3,Ok,i thought that it did something else. i am sure it would do great for what it was built for but i am stupid and did not read it very well.
2,"Made in Mexico, huh?","The DVD arived on time and in good condition however it is not what is portrayed in the description. The DVD package has no slipcover as indicated in the image. Instead it came wrapped in plastic with the words ""made in Mexico"" printed in blue letters. Although the DVD case is of good quality, it is not a true Disney DVD case which becomes obvious when compared to real Disney DVD cases. The discs have a ""raised"" printed image; a true Disney DVD is perfectly smooth. The overall quality isn't bad at all. However what I wanted was the real thing. This is not a real collectable as the image shown implied. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,Lady and the Tramp,"One of Disney's most endearing family classics, ""Tramp"" is a marvel of lively animation, bright voice acting, and sensational songwriting, courtesy of the inimitable Peggy Lee (who also voices the sinister twin kitties, Si and Am.) Watching a pampered female pooch fall for a declassé but charismatic male doggie is not only fun but enlightening about the magic of mutual attraction. And the famous spaghetti-slurping scene leading to a surprise first kiss is charming no matter how many times you view it. Highlights include the vamp-y ""He's a Tramp"" and ""Siamese Cat Song."""
5,Lady and the Tramp,"Lady and the Tramp was one of my favorite movies in childhood. Watching it again only supports my endeared feelings I have had for so many years. I am glad I was able to watch, go back and experience like I did when I was a child. This movie, I will always hold dear. The talent has transcended into this decade and has kept the meaning of romance and true love alive with the music and animation."
3,Scratched,I loved this movie as a child so I was so excited to share it with my daughters. It came with a scratch big enough to stop the DVD from playing for a few scenes. Not a huge deal but definitely a hassle because you have to stop the movie and scene select a future scene to get it to start playing again.
2,"Inexcusable lack of extras, while the pricing remains high","The movie's great. The lack of stars refers to the current Disney administration's poor presentation of their titles on DVD (no doubt because they're going to release them AGAIN down the road with extras and try to charge their customers AGAIN. What villains!According to a review at dvdfile.com, this classic as actually filmed in two aspect ratios. Disney did not bother to include both on this DVD. Here's a sample from the dvdfile review:""A word to the folks at Disney: by keeping prices high and features down, you're helping to alienate even your staunchest supporters, of which I used to be one. Unfortunately, not recommended."""
5,Great Classic Disney Movie,Disney knows just how to put it in a Movie. Kids and Adults love their movies.
5,I Remember...,seeing this when I was little at a drive in theater. The movie is still well worth getting and is very cute. My mom kept asking when this would come out so she could get it for my 1 year old. When she is a little older I'm sure this will be one of her favorites.
3,Why is Tramp light brown,"i bought this bluray for my girl friend, both of us hadnt seen this movie in ages, first few minutes all is fine and then the Tramp shows up sporting a new brown coat. this would have been fine,a little off putting but fine had he not changed colors drastically throughout the film the most noticible to me is the first time seing him compaired to him at cristmas where he matches the color of his new born son (a very light grey) at other times such as at night he is a very dark grey or brown, but these arnt the only instances practically the entire movie every time you see the tramp he is a diffrent color"
4,lady and tramp vhs,"Good quality, played well in VHS player. The box was kind of smashed, but it was still decent."
1,Not really a review,"(I rated this as 1 star because it wouldn't let me do oterwise.) I just wanted to know......How can this movie be available as ""New"" when Disney still has it in the vault?"
1,never showed up,I was billed for this dvd but I never received it. I tried to contact the seller but never got any reply.
1,Unhappy patron,"Today 5/23/2011 I still have not received my purchase.9101900007540570137517 is the postal tracking number I was Given.The purchaser advised MEEE to file the search, which I have done, todate they still have not found the Package.I feel the sender should have done the tracking since he/She knows what they sent it in.I do not advise first time buyers to use Amazon"
5,Positive,"This is the second year in a row that I have ordered this DVD. Lady and the Tramp is their favorite and they watch it over and over. Thus, they wore the first one out in a year. I'll probably be looking for another one next Christmas. I ordered it late, but was pleasantly surprised to get it by Christmas. Thank you."
4,NICE!!,Great item!!! Hard to find in stores and i needed it for a christmas gift.I am very happy with the purchase of this DVD and look forward to buying more.
3,La Dama y el Vagabundo,I was very happy with my purchase and will recomed it to everybody .It arrived in perfect condition and pretty fast
3,Tramp,"the delivery was fast. the quality of the DVD is excellent. I just didn't realized when I bought it that it didn't come in the original used box, but it was sent in a small DVD clear casing. I was kind of expecting the DVD casing as all the other movies that i have bought. Maybe it was listed but I din't notice when I made the purchase. But the important thing is that the movie works like a charm."
5,Found it!,We looked around for Lady and the Tramp and had trouble finding it. It is one of our MOST favorite Disney movies! So glad Amazon had it!
1,Lady and the Tramp,"My Grandaughter received The Lady and the Tramp on Dec. 20th. 08. So far so good. Problem, the DVD is in Korean."
1,Disappointed with the product,"I was so excited to get the ""Lady & the Tramp"" DVD and watch it with my grandaughters. Unfortunately, the tape is faulty and is not watchable."
1,Used DVD,"This was a 2 DVD set, advertised as used, but new condition. The bonus DVD was cracked and the DVD of the movie was scratched and skipped and stuck..my daughter was very disappointed that she did not get to watch Lady and the Tramp."
1,Totally Worthless!,The DVD is from some unknown country- everything on the packaging except the title is written in some language I have never seen and the soundtrack has been dubbed in this language as well. I purchased this for my son who has autism at his request and he won't even keep it in his room. Very disappointing!
5,"A wonderful, wonderful film!","There is just something magical about this movie! So many times, when I put this film on for my children- ages 4 and 2- to watch, I am drawn to sit down and watch along. And not many of their films have that effect on me (only other, Monster's, Inc.!). The characters are all highly endearing, the artwork beautiful, and the story classic in every way. A MUST HAVE film for any family!"
4,very satified,I am very pleased with the video I purchased from youand you had excellent timing on getting it to me.A very satified customer
4,Cute movie,My 5-yr-old daughter loves this movie and acts out scenes from it all the time. A Disney classic!
5,Excellent!,"I have wanted this movie for so long and thanks to amazon, I finally have it. Great prices and free shipping, you cant go wrong!"
5,Best Version Ever,This is a great remastered version such clear and crisp picture of the well known movie we have all come to adore and love. The story about lady who falls in love with the tramp from the other side of the tracks.
2,not top notch,My daughter loves the movie but I hate the noise it makes while playing. I don't know if it is unbalanced or what but it makes a semi loud humming noise when it is being played. Only movie in her collection that does that so I am assuming it is the disc itself. I belive it is an extremely old copy of the movie.
4,"A beautiful, lesser work in the Disney cannon.","Although not nearly as dark as Pinnochio, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, or many other classic Disney films, Lady and the Tramp is still a wonderful movie. It is exceedingly well paced, has a great cast of characters, and has a simple but lovingly rendered theme of love and committment. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sheer charm. The original tag line for the film was ""His Happiest Motion Picture!""It is also a tour-de-force of classic cel animation, rendered for the super-wide Cinemascope frame of the 1950s. The backgrounds are so lovely you just want to walk into the frame and live in them. There is nothing like it to be seen in today's digital animation, or in Miyazaki...anywhere."
5,BEAUTIFUL TRANSFORMATION!!,"Let me start off by saying I used to own this movie on VHS. Now as most of you know I am sure, the version on VHS was more on the dull side as far as colors go. And the clarity of the details was not quite that sharp in appearance.They then came out with the DVD, which was far better. The colors were definitely brighter.Now with Blu-ray, on the other hand, not only are the colors bright but the details are so crisp and clear! I notice textures I could not originally see on the older versions of this film. It is absolutely amazing! The second I hit ""play"" on the menu and the opening credits began to roll I literally said ""wow"" because the textures that I never noticed before were suddenly noticed by me for the first time.I love it. The blu-ray is definitely worth getting!"
5,Lady and the Tramp - Review,"Lady and the Tramp is a truly classic tale. This movie has something for people of all ages. And, if you are a dog lover, you can't beat it!"
1,very unhappy,"My 2 disk 50th anniversary edition was only only a one disk silk screened copy of the movie, but my daugher loved the movie so much we had to keep it. Please be wary of this seller before buying their products."
1,lady and the tramp,This movie was as fantastic and great and it just as I remember it when the kids were little. Great!
5,Lady and the Tramp,I have always loved this movie and I bought it for my kids to add to their growing love and collection of Disney movies. I think it's absolutely wonderful.
5,Great!,I have never seen this movie look so good!!!Disney has done a great job on this one showing it in its real OAR.Totally recommend it!!!
5,A Disney Standard,"Older animated movie, but the kids still love it. Heartwarming story, good movie to pop in on a rainy day.."
3,USED not NEW,This product was advertised as NEW and was all sealed up as new but one of the discs was all scratched up and definitely USED!
4,Technical Problem Resolved by Disney,"We had the same problem as a previous reviewer had with this DVD - everything played except the movie! Both fullscreen and widescreen versions just hung and refused to play in our Sharp DVD/VCR combo player. Well, we contacted Disney's customer support and found a solution to the problem - our DVD player is hanging up on playing the starting credits of the movie. They gave us a work-around (start on scene 2 and rewind to beginning). Great support from Disney! The movie itself, of course, is a wonderful and very enjoyable classic!"
5,Lady and Tramp,Package arrived in great shape. Item ordered was received in a timely matter. Appreciate the great service. have good day.
5,Happy!!,"I bought this CD to my daugther and the service was excelent and the CD like new, i'm very happy..."
5,Well Worth the Money and a Wonderful Disney Classic,"""Lady & the Tramp"" is a wonderful Disney film. I got the Blu-Ray on the day it came out and I'm happy to say that I am very satisfied with the transfer. The sound and picture quality is amazing. What surprised me though is the fact that instead of using the 2006 CGI castle Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning, they leave the 1990 logo like on the Platinum Edition DVD. But that's just a minor complaint, nothing huge. The bonus features are great, however, they lack on the DVD. I truly enjoyed the introduction at the beginning by Dianne Disney Miller (Walt's daughter). I also liked the clips from the Disneyland TV show that were included on the Blu-Ray. This was also great for me because I missed out on getting the Platinum Edition DVD back in 2006, so now I get to enjoy this. I'm looking forward to the next two Diamond Edition titles being ""Cinderella"" and ""Aladdin."""
5,Even a dog could rate this 5 stars!,"Quite simply, Disney's most effective and saccharine movie to date, it is an adorable movie with unforgettable characters, and Disney's trademark impeccable attention to detail in making the moves and mannerims of a cartoon dog true to life. How can a person with a heart that isn't made of stone watch the ever-so-famous (and ever-so-repeated) ""spaghetti scene"" and end watching it with a dry eye? It is virtually impossible. ""La Bella Notte"" is a beautiful song. All the characters are beautifully drawn, and the romance between Lady and the Tramp is poignant and believable. This is a truly welcome- and why not, essential, too?- addition to the collection of any good film viewer. Films such as these are not made anymore, and that is a pity of course.If you haven't watched this, do yourself a favor. Anyone who is anyone would love this film...especially the dogs, ladies and tramps of the world!"
4,"""Lady and the Tramp","""Lady and the Tramp"" has got to be the single most mature animated film the Disney studios has ever made. The themes of loyalty, rejection, and the question of ""freedom"" are subject matter Disney had never dealt with before. The writing, animation art, and music come together to create a leisurly, entertaining film that builds to a highly dramatic conclusion. The only quibble with the film is the shoddy sound mixing job. Often, the music track is so loud that it obscures the vocal singing and dialogue--and at times, entire lines of dialogue are missing. Shame on THX!! The picture, however, is magnificent. If it weren't for the sound, I'd give this 5 stars!"
5,A Disney Classic,"This a pure classic from Disney's golden age. The story is a classic love story between two different people (or dogs). The spaghetti eating scene is a classic. It was repeated in Hot Shots! Part Duex several years later with Charlie Sheen.Lady is a well-bread Cocker Spaniel and Butch (The Tramp) is a free roaming mutt who has a nose for trouble. Like many of Disney's amimated movies, it can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. The musical score is typically good for a Disney cartoon."
5,Replacing old Disney VHS with DVD's,Always looking to replace our old VHS movies with DVD's. This is a favorite no matter how old we are.
4,Lady & the tramp,Very happy to get the movie prior to it going back to the vault. Enjoyable to watch.
1,Lady and the Tramp,We were dissappointed in it because of the annoying subtitles and the Korean language being spoken.The seller was very nice.We returned it and received a full refund. Sincerely Raymond and Michele Chico.
3,OUCH!,"Well, all I know is that after my 3 year old son watched this movie he ran around on all fours barking and then he started howling and THEN HE BIT ME!"
1,no aspect ratio!!!,"Be Careful when buying this blue ray, it states its in its old format which is a huge square on your tv...not like the way its supposed to be shown in cinemascope. buy the old version of the dvd instead....the quality transfer is way better and you can pick if you want it in full frame or original cinemascope. trust me!"
1,Disappointed,"I've read the other review here and decided to add the voice of my experience as well. For whatever reason, all of the 8 batteries I bought also malfunctioned. They didn't hold a charge or charge at all. The 4 of 8 that did initially work slowly started to malfunction as well, so that after 6 months I needed to buy new NiMH batteries (Rayovac, which have been working great."
5,Absolute Classic!,This is a classic movie! I am not sure if you can call yourself an American if you have not seen this movie haha. I definitely recommend this movie!
5,When you need something fun to watch,"It was late, could not sleep and saw this on my Kindle Fire HD. Love the parade scene so I thought I'd watch it. Great way to get relaxed."
5,fun,"Lots of fun. Funny movie good acting and interesting plot. Teen movie everyone will enjoy, fun. Want haha watch this movie"
5,A movie classic,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.I don't know how many times I've watched this, over the years.Stands up to the test of time - a classic."
4,A review about 25 years too late,"We never did get around to watching this when it came out in the 80's, so when I saw it listed on Amazon Instant Prime, we said, ""why not?""It was pretty entertaining. I probably would have enjoyed it as a five star had I seen it back then, but with the advances in movie technology, we've become spoiled (plus we're older and wiser supposedly now), so I'll reserve that last star."
1,Didn't enjoy!,Don't think I laughed once. Thought it was boring. I've heard a bunch of people say they liked it... So after that build up I was expecting more.
2,"I don't mind rating the product, but I don't want to write a comment","I don't mind rating the product, but I don't want to write a comment6 more words required.6 more words required."
4,a chocolate treat,"more substance than many of the chocolate series, enjoyed it! Good light read for an afternoon or evening by the fire."
4,Pretty good mouse trap,This was a fun read and a good addition to the series and I'm not a chocolate fan.
3,The very best of Charles Trenet,"This contains quite a few non-descript and not too charming tunes, although the singing is good."
3,nothing unheard of,this album makes worthwile listening exspecially to someone who is new to 80s music scene otherwise this is a very famaliar list of songs
3,As good as sex and murder gets together,It is a very entertaining piece of work which I suprisingly enjoyed. The Characters are alive and the storyline takes your full attention. A fun read.
5,A very funny and entertaining mystery!,"Move over Bailey Wiggins and Stephanie Plum, there's a new girl in town! Sophie Katz is a fictitious mystery writer who is now at the heart of her own mystery as she tries to discover who is trying to kill her! Sophie, who is half African-American and half-Jewish, teams up with her friends Dena, Mary Ann and Marcus to solve a mystery that will leave readers wondering ""who did it."" Set in San Francisco, ""Sex, Murder and a Double Latte,"" marks Kyra Davis' first book. I'm hoping it will be the first of many mysteries. Anyone who has ever lived in San Francisco, has a passion for mysteries and chick lit, and can't pass a Starbucks without making a pit stop, it sure to love this book!"
4,nice entertaining read,"I'm torn between a 3 and 4 but overall I enjoyed the book enough to buy the next 2 in the series so I gave it a 4. In this series the main character is an author or murder mysteries and it appears someone is killing people by copying the acts in her books. And someone has been in her apartment doing things that are mentioned in the books like moving a glass, etc but the police don't believe her. Several other characters are introduced and she has the hots for this one good looking guy and well lots of twists and turns and people she just 'knows' are the murderer at one point or another. I like her friend Dena but as another reviewer said, maryann is just made to be too dumb..no one can be that stupid and survive in this world! I love her gay friend Marcus and though the main character bugged me some with her self-centeredness I ended up liking her overall."
5,"Witty, Charming and a Great Murder Mystery!","The book is a page turner! Great story line, very funny (every page)and great characters!I couldn't put it down and I'm looking forward to reading her next novel."
2,Upset and wondering,This was a let down. I really looked forward to reading this book. When i got it i placed my current book i was reading by James Patterson(MARY MARY)down to read this one. The story started out very boring and from there it lost me. I think the author was try to hard to make this character hip and exciting. She failed. I read a lot of books and this was a fast disappointment. Sorry but the Lattes were more exciting.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This book was absolutely terrible. If you like mysteries, don't read this! Being a James Patterson fan, I thought this one would be a new and engaging because it would have a feminine side to it. The cover looked witty, but definitely deceptive. There were too many coincidences and plot was too impossible. It wasn't even funny because it sounded as though the author tried too hard being witty. Don't bother wasting your money or your time."
4,"Sex, Murder and The Look for Less!","Hey, I'm watching an episode of this author's appearance on the Style channel show, The Look for Less! She's adorable and haulin' tail to make the show's one hour fashion transformation deadline. So what does that have to do with the book, you ask? Well, I personally DO believe in judging the book by the cover and I'm liking it. I don't normally read Murder Mysteries, but this one seems cute, quick and cunning. I hope I like it. Four stars leaves the mystery... will she earn the 5th one? Uh, Amazon Barrista! Can I get one Sex, Murder and a Double Latte, make that 2 double lattes!? Thanks!"
5,fun read,It was well written book I had fun reading it! It was also a quick read that hooked you in quickly!
3,Spectrum&The Imaginary Friends-'Interface/Come Out To Play' (Space Age),"A 2000 release of Sonic Boom(from Spacemen 3),with some help from Imaginary Friends.This seven track CD isn't NEAR as good as his 'Forever Alien' effort(see my review).Best described as experimental/ambient pop.Tunes here that are most notable are the catchy opener ""Glitch"",the punk-like ""Syndrome"" and the ten-minute ""Taste The Night"".Spacemen 3 completists and REAL open-minded collectors would likely get more from this piece than I did."
3,"starts off well, but...","It seems as though Diane Purkiss tried to do too much. There are a lot of interesting tidbits here, and she starts off strong with an interesting thesis that the origin of fairy-type myths is actually in the demons of the Mediteranean, etc. rather than in Celtic beliefs. Unfortunately, while I think her purpose here was to provide a clear continuum of fairy beliefs to the present, her arguments get a bit muddled as she tries to gather together a lot of different fairy types/stories in one place, organized by historical time period, without exactly explaining where or how they fit with one another. There are no strong conclusions to tie the book together - if anything one ends up rereading the introduction to try and keep her chain of reasoning straight. I had difficulty getting through it and I am very interested in this kind of material. Try Katharine Briggs' Encyclopedia instead, if you can find it."
4,heavy but worth it,"I may have misjudged this book at first. It is a heavier read than I expected and so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are seriously interested in the subject - HOWEVER reading this book has its share of rewards. Diane Purkiss diligently explores fairy myths through history and the most interesting aspect of her work is that she links them with the perspective and concerns of WOMEN - especially in terms of childbirth and death, both of oneself and/or the child. Read it, but be prepared to lose your romantic notions. I had quite a bit of knowledge of fairy lore and I still had to come to terms with losing mine - which may have led me to rate it more harshly than was deserved on the first read. Little did I realize the sorrow and fear at the base of fairy lore - an important lesson that the author teaches with patience and thoroughness."
3,what you never knew about fairies,"i didn't know too much about fairy lore when i read this book. i knew the basics, a bit of tinkerbell, shakespeare's fairies, the fairy picture scam... and the like, but after reading diane purkiss's book, i feel a bit more aqauinted with the fairy world.it's an interesting history, and i have nothing to compare it to in terms of thoroughness etc. i wasn't too particularly keen on her writing style, her asides were not very funny (i think she was trying to be humorous) and were jarring intermingled with the material. some of the sections were tedious to read, instead of retelling the old stories in a lot of places she had excerpts from the material, and they were annoying to trudge through (i've never been a fan of reading olde english).for strict enjoyment purposes i would say don't get this, but if you are interested in fairy lore and really want to learn about it, then i say go ahead and get it. (i checked it out of the library...)"
4,I can't wait for the next book!!!,"I love reading historical fiction because, when it's done correctly, we can live in a time that has past. ""The Hippopotamus Marsh"" is the first book by Pauline Gedge that I have read, and I will probably read some of her others. She writes so descriptively that you really feel like you are in the story. I will admit that the book is a little hard to get into. There are so many characters that a list and descriptions are at the front of the book, and I used it frequently at the beginning! Once I got into the story though, I was hooked! You feel for Sequenenra and his family and you want them to overthrow the King Apepa. I won't give anything away, I hate it when people do that, just read this book. If you enjoy historical fiction, Ancient Egypt, or a story about a family that loves each other, you'll like ""The Hippopotamus Marsh."""
2,Oops,"Oops, sorry, I meant that review for The Oasis, which is the 2nd book in the trilogy. This first one was OK, but too drawn out. The whole series is mundane."
2,Better than the first book,"Rather mundane. The interesting aspect is ancient Egypt. Kamose as interesting, too."
2,The Hippopotamus Marsh,"I bought this book, but when I began reading it, I wished that I had not. I found it uninteresting and hard to follow. I am very interested in ancient Egypt, and some of the information in this book was rather intriguing. I may not have enjoyed the book because I am too young for it, but if you are a teenager, read it, don't buy it."
5,One of my favorites,"If you never saw this movie, buy it.....You won't regret it....Especially if you came of age in the 60's.........Everyone in this movie is great. Dennis Hopper is one funny dude."
5,This movie is classic comedy.,"I love this movie. Has great actors in it. Who doesn't love Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Hopper!!! If you truly want a movie with alot of laughs, this is it."
5,A movie to go back to,"This came out when I was 3, and Mom and I still have the laserdisc version of it. This movie is a great showing about how things have changed, if what Mom says about the 60's and 70's is true. Either way, it's a very fun movie. I feel the urge to watch it at least once a year. Keifer Sutherland plays a ""me generation"" FBI agent who is sent to take an ex-yippie, played by Dennis Hopper, to a prison where he can serve his sentence for disconnecting Spiro Agnew's train car. The cop and the ex-yippie end up having to flee for their lives and depend on each other for their survival, even if they drive each other crazy. In the end, the cop decides to let the ex-yippie run away. The sort of twist at the very end is nice, and I smile and chuckle thinking about it. I highly recommend it to anyone born in the late 80's who feels like they should have been in college in the 60's."
5,Hopper and the Sutherland Kid,"Hey, all you Hopper cultists--don't tell me you missed this one. It's delightful + there's Carol Kane and she's always nutzoid chic. Briefly, Kiefer Sutherland is an FBI agent taking Hopper, an refugee from justice as a result of some infractions in the 60s. Whilest traveling together, they becoming truly caring of one another; save one another's life and Hopper walks away in a great white suit. A fab movie!"
5,Funny Little Witch,"Funny Witch!for the Witches and Wizards lovers!can b ea fun toy for a kid above three or for a grown up who wants to decoratetheir shelves or car!I have a whole collection of Witches(It is my stuff!LOL)this one is a must for my collection!so cute and not too expensive and very realistic an d fun to play with!Yes,Yes,Yes,i play with my Witches!"
4,A Gentle Practice,"Indra Devi was a student of Sri T. Krishnamacharya, the teacher of B. K. S. Iyengar and K. Pattabhi Jois. She teaches a style of yoga known as ""Viniyoga"". It is characterized by ""vinyasa-krama"" (sequential process). It emphasizes a yoga practice that complements everyone's unique physical capabilities. Breathing is coordinated with movements. This is a very gentle type of practice perfect for beginners or seniors."
1,Terrible.,"I spent $50 on this trash, thinking it a good game. I read previews, but not reviews. The game is a good idea, but they did it terribly. I would not even spend $5 on it."
4,Mature Gameplay in the Right Direction (but far from great),"It appears to me as if this game is a step in the right direction. Street level diplomacy and harsh, even illegal tactics combine to create a game about wooing the crowds and intimidating them at times.This is a game which employs approaches of combat, cheap espionage, and polemic approach. The stuff of legends could've been done with this theme and gameplay idea, but regrettably the game does not have sufficient variety.On the other hand, this game offers much of what web-browser games could and should permit in terms of thought provoking theme and game approach.Production values and variety could've been better, is all."
4,People need this book!!,"Even the title is powerful, my Pastor said this is one of the most profound books he has ever read. Every word in this book is anointed. I never read a book this small and it's contents so ENORMOUS!! No matter what your beliefs are you have to read this book."
2,SO/SO,"first of all i'm a big fan of Richard Pryor,REdd Foxx,Eddie Murphy&Della Reese.but the script is weak and lacks structure.i expected to be at the movie house everyday and be loving this but it was ironicly not very funny except for an exchange between Red Foxx&DElla Reese."
2,"Great Cast, Terrible Script","This could have been an all-time classic but the script is just awful. So much talent in the cast just wasted on bad writing. There were some very funny moments in the film though, its not a total waste"
4,Veiwers choice,"This movie never really got the exposure it should have. I will admitt it is one of thos movies you simply must watch more than once because you miss all of the funny lines the first time. I did not care for all of the swearing; It should have been toned down. I feel if it were made today Eddie Murphy would have not had so much profanity in it. I also did not care for Jazzmine Guy as a sex symbol- her pettite frame and previous role as Witney Gilbert on the TV sitcom, made it hard for me to see her as sexy. Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx were right on key. I really liked the clothes of that era and Eddie Murphy did a wonderful job of creating a very nastolgic look back."
3,not that good.....,it was okay but not worth the money. Catch it when it is on TV and all the bad words have been bleeped out....
4,If you don't like this you must be a blind......,"Fans of the movie know what would come next in the title of this review. I don't know about the black/white humor thing - I'm white and my husband and I and another couple find this movie side splitting. The talented comedians in this film are great! We have quoted lines to each other from this film for at least the last ten years, anyway. So glad it's out in DVD. It will make a great Valentine's gift for dh."
1,BLANK DVD,WHEN WE RECEIVED THE DVD IT WAS BLANK! TRIED PLAYING IT ON DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS AND NOTHING!WON'T GO THIS ROUTE AGAIN!
5,5 stars for one of the best comedy movies ever,one of the best comedies ever. The DVD just makes it that much clearer. the only down side is lack of bonus material.
5,How can you NOT like this movie???,"Ive seen a LOT of movies in my day and I must say that this is by FAR the most hilarious. From the opening scene to the very end, its guaranteed to have your stomach hurting. I cant believe how much the critics bashed this, but like a lot of previous reviews, I think this is a matter of ""colored"" opinion. Everyone knows that white humor is different from black humor. I respect the fact that this script didnt refer to the cliched punchlines and the typical comedy tactics to showcase their talents. And who cares that the language was harsh? Its the same language utilized in their stand up routines that you all fell in love with, so why does it matter that the same formula was applied to a movie???This is a DEFINITE must have!!! I was young when I saw this in the theaters, and since then, Ive seen this movie so much, I can almost recite the lines and I STILL laugh EVERY time I see it.If you dont own this, you are DEFINITELY missing out!!!"
5,Classic Comedy,"I do not know why this film got such bad reviews. To this day it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The opening sequence is incredible and the movie just gets better from there. I still laugh at it after having seen it umpteen times. So all you critics, lighten up. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a funny laugh-a-minute good time."
3,Good mOVIE BAD PACKAGE HANDLING,need to do a beeter job of packaging and handling your dvd movies this is the case for all the dvds i've bought from you guys so far.
4,Classic comedy,"Come on, the cast list itself should sell this movie! Just get it. Should be in everyone's library."
4,Harlem Nights,"This isn't exactly a family movie, but it is a very good one. Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy make a good team in this period piece about the 1930's and speakeasy nightclubs. The story, acting, music, and costumes are excellent. I highly recommend you at least rent this one. The language is a a bit foul at times but does not overwhelm the movie. When a big time hood decides to take over Pryor's and Murphie's club they come up with a plan to foil him that is reminiscent of the style used in other movies about conning the cons, but quite different and a work of art. Don't miss this one. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Sting"".CA Luster"
4,"Eddie,Richard & Redd at their best","Harlem Nights is a great that stars the funniest three black comics to ever grace a comdey stage. Eddie Murphy knew what he was doing when he decided to cast Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor in the other two male leads. The film has great one-liners and a amusing fight scene between Eddie and Della Reese. If you've never seen this film, you're in for a treat"
4,Harlem Nights,This is a great movie if you are in the mood for comedy. I remember watching this when I was a kid and it is still just as funny. Check it out!
5,"Who cares what the ""critics"" think?","The editorial for this film is total BS! I remember seeing this film in the theaters as a seven year old. Although I did not understand all of the jargon associated with the film, I laughed. The most funny scene was the ""pinky toe"" incident between Reese and Murphy. As a twenty year old, I still laugh at this film and it will always be in my top 10 films of all time. One reviewer put it into perspective. Caucasian humor is truly different than Black humor. For instance, what is the TV show ""Friends"" all about?!?!"
5,"Foxx, Pryor, and Murphy...What More Could You Ask For?","Harlem Nights is such an overlooked film in the comedy genre. There are so many hilarious exchanges in this film, especially between Redd Foxx and Della Reese. Richard Pryor actually plays the straight man in this and does a pretty admirable job. Eddie Murphy plays his son Quick, who is a hot headed gambler. The supporting cast is really what sets this film apart from others. Arsenio Hall plays the brother of slain character Tommy Smalls and is immensely effective in his brief appearance. Danny Aiello plays the crooked cop Phil Cantone so smugly that you want to reach through the screen and smash his face. But Redd Foxx and Della Reese steal the show with their hilarious banter about each others weight and eyesight. It is apparently clear that of these three generations of comic heavyweights, Redd Foxx is the undisputed champion. This is a fine addition to any dvd collection and as good as it gets in the comic genre."
4,good old classic,"always pleased with DVD's we buy from Amazon, have never had a problem with used or new. We enjoy the old classic movies like Harlem Nights, it's funny and makes for a good movie night with home made popcorn. All the actors in this movie are classic's in themselfs, they don't make a lot of movies like they did, this movie I feel was one of Eddie Murphys best, more serious and not all crazy, good acting.the second DVD we are reviewing is ""Silverstreak"", this is another classic with great actors, wish they were still making movies, it's sad that Jill Clayborn has passed, she was such a great actress, it's a movie for a good laugh, enjoyed this movie, could watch over and over again."
3,Expecting more from this cast,"There were funny moments for sure, but Richard Prior is inherently much funnier than this role allowed him to be."
5,classic funny shit,"Some funny shit no matter how many times I watch it classic, it all ways funny an all the old school actors."
1,What I bad movie this is!,"One word: DREADFUL! The dialog is woefully inaccurate for that time period. There is absolutely nothing enjoyable about this movie. It's no wonder this is the only movie Eddie Murphy ever directed, no studio in their right mind would hire him as a director again after this mess. Murphy was at the height of his popularity when this movie was made, and the arrogance showed big-time in this movie. You still need to entertain, Eddie! I would have given this zero (O) stars if I was able to."
1,what is this,"I thought this was battle movie with Arabiac soldiers. Don't buy, this is bad city movie. don't Like. -Hiroki"
1,Ugly Don't shop at suncoast,My young friend was going to buy this movie at suncoast they were mean and wouldn't let him purchase it because he was only 16. Get it from tower.
3,"This film kinda drags in the beginning, but it has a satisfying ending","Artistically, this film is not as classy as ""Hoodlum"", and not as shady and crafty as ""The Sting"", but is does provide a little chemistry of both. Eddie Murphy's character as Quick was predictable of Eddie's oft repeated humor and style, but, I really thought that Richard Pryor as Sugar Ray was pretty cool for keeping his cool, and showing finesse as a careful and conservative illegal night club owner. Redd Foxx was great to watch again, Jasmine Guy looked fabulous, but Della Reese was annoying. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film as a one-time view.I enjoy movies with a backdrop of the 1930's. However, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is still my favorite. Oh, and I guess I can't let myself forget the wonderful Michael Keaton film, ""Johnny Dangerously."""
5,everytime we hear this album we have to dance and make love,the one line summary i provided says it all
5,Spiritual...personal...wonderful...,"I saw Ms. Childs in concert and was absolutely blown away. So passionate, so powerful, yet so absolutely human and real. She took time to talk to the audience, she took time to slow down and admit she was tired. She communicated with the audience, and was replenished by us. Energy. That's the word I was looking for. The energy she brought forth was the energy deep inside of us and it was manifest in the room that night. It was a living entity unto itself, spontaneous, empowering, alive.That spirit is captured on this recording. You don't just listen. Whatever it is she is trying to get at manifests itself in song. It lives inside of you."
5,"This hit the spot, and keeps on doing so even now...","I first heard 'Stop Your Fussin'' blaring from an open-top car way back then. I managed to find out who the artist was (I forget how), got a copy and spent the next 6 months listening to not much else. And now 15 years later I'm STILL not bored with this album (or any of her others, for that matter). My favourite? Definitely 'Zimbabwe' - one of the most beautiful songs ever written.There are two groups/singers that I will never tire of - Pink Floyd and Tony Childs. The difference between the two merely illustrates how the music is the important element, and not the genre."
1,don't waste your money,This book was so simplistic as to be useless. I was a travel writer for ten years and wanted to learn more about the nuts and bolts of the business. I didn't learn a single thing. What a waste of time and money.
2,Ouch,Life Stride is usually a winner for me but these little beaut's hurt my toes after about an hours wear. This is very unusual for me with this brand.
2,Comfort from the first wear!,"Several years ago, I had foot issues and a pair of Life Strides was the only shoe I could wear with any comfort. Since then, I rarely buy anything but Life Strides. Life Strides are comfortable from the first wear, as was this style. It looks great, very versatile, very reasonably priced."
1,Please enter a title for your review:,"another equal worst episode of the series. the entire thing is like watching paint dry from start to finish. it could have been edited down to 5 minutes and would still have failed to hold my interest. it has two of the requisite bloody/gore scenes typical of the series which are used entirely for gross out value, not inciting any fear or atmosphere."
1,Item is not as advertised,Received item but had no cover as indicated in both picture and writing. Amazon has no idea how or where to get lid. Over charged for item with NO COVER! Don't reccomend purching any item from this catagory.
1,Hawaii Calls (Import) Waikiki Minstrels,"This album is a [imitation]!!! They pretend that they are the original Hawaii Calls, far from it. If you enjoy great authentic Hawaiian Music, check out the original Hawaii Calls line from Hawaii Calls out of Hawaii. Their complete line is available at all Borders stores through out Hawaii, or go on line to HawaiiCalls.com to listen to their live shows.You'll really enjoy the music."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I thought I was listening to country and western -- and I don't like country and western. I've heard better hawaiian music in a John Wayne movie.I do not doubt these folks could play Hawaiian music, if they would let themselves go......rather, they opted to play some facsimile....I don't even know what else you could call it.I say forget it, try another CD if you want Hawaiian music. Its certainly not this one. I won't even keep it.....I don't want it in my collection."
5,il migliore ricettario italiano,"I bought this cookbook over 22 years ago, before the cooking industry became embellished with designer cooking and designer photos, and it still my favorite above all 15 other Italian cookbooks that I own.The book was originally published in 1969 and written in Italian, but has been very well translated into English. Ada Boni also wrote The Talisman Cookbook, which is a very good, very basic book for cooking Italian (I own that, too).There are more than 600 authentic recipes from 14 of Italy's 20 diverse regions (antipasti, main dishes, and intriguing desserts), and 144 pages of full color photographs against local settings, an added treat. Along with each section comes a lovely introduction to that regions style of cooking. This cookbook is as close as it comes to true home-style Italian cooking.Consider yourself fortunate to find one of Ada's delightful books on the internet!Buona cucina!"
1,Don't buy Maxell batts....6 months then dead batteries.,WARNING....Don't buy Maxell batteries. Opened a sealed 10 pack Alkaline AAA pack 6 months after Amazon purchase.All dead or near dead. Their Exp.date 05-2013.DEAD 2.5 years BEFORE expiration date!Glad I didn't need these Maxell batts in an EMERGENCY. Maxell LR03 10BP.Luckily I had some much older Duracells AAA for the new LED flashlights I bought.NYC Electronics via Amazon Fulfillment
1,40% were DEAD.,"I ordered two packs of 10 Maxell AAA batteries each, sold by NYC Electronics and fulfilled by Amazon. The batteries arrived OK inside unopened plastic/carded packages as shown. All of the batteries had the same date stamp of 05-2013. However, several of the batteries were completely dead, as demonstrated by my calculator and a simple battery tester that has proven reliable in the past.Specifically, 3 out of the first 10 were dead, and 5 out of the second 10 were dead. The remaining batteries all appear to have a full charge, so I got 8 bad and 12 good batteries out of 20. Not what you expect! I've NEVER bought new batteries and found dead ones before.Thankfully, Amazon made it easy to return them for a full refund."
3,just batteries,"50 cents seems to be the average price for a battery. If this package arrives loose, then demand a full refund because it is important that all batteries used are equally fresh.grb"
2,"Looks like old stock, died quickly","Energizer and Duracell batteries have lasted so much longer than these. I think these are probably old stock or something, but they ran out in a flash. Wouldn't be buying these again."
4,9 / 10 Good!,"The Maxell AAA batteries arrived new in the package as shown.Nine tested at 1.5V or above.One was 0.89V, which I discarded.I think still a good deal."
2,Don't bother...,"Waste of money. Out of 10 batteries, 4 tested below 1 volt. Might as well just buy named brand batteries."
5,Basic woodcarving reference manual,"This ought to be within reach if you love to carve in wood. Plenty of illustrations and easy to understand text. Having this book would keep you from having to own a lot of other related material. It covers it all, especially with vol.2."
5,If Enrique Iglesias had a son,"Shalim, why is this man not a mega star? I had no idea who Shalim was when his video for Nadie Como Tu came on MTV Espanol, but when the video was over I was wanting more, so I got the cd... not poppy dance like the remix of Nadie Como Tu but more along the lines of traditional romantic pop, Shalim to me is like the son of Enrique Iglesias, and just like Enrique I think Shalim will be a megastar one day and will be able to sing the hits off this debut cd years to come when people know who he is, and if he dosent make it, that will be because his last name is not Iglesias."
4,Far out,"I have heard his songs and i believe for a new comer and a teen artist SHALIM has done well with his ballad and strong lyrics he can captivate all teen girls. what is so excellent of this CD is that thunderpuss had made the remix for nadie como tu and it take the song into another level. it would be nice if Nadie Como Tu was release as a single remix to the public I know it will sell, specialy in the american market, as long they have the full english version instead of the spanglish version.... You really have to sit and listen to this CD. it is a great disc for those who are in love and are romantic. . . let just hope if he comes out with a new album that he can suprise us with his magic lyric ... peace"
2,que va!,"La música y el concepto del primer álbum del hijo de Charitín tienen grabada la marca de los artistas pop producidos por Emilio Estefan y Jon Secada: ritmos ""latinos"" (que bien podríamos llamar ""de Miami"") en baladas y dance pop, con la diferencia de que la característica principal del disco es la mezcla de ritmos y sonidos orientales con el pop moderno. Esta producción consta de 12 temas que se pasean entre el español y el inglés y 1 club mix del primer sencillo, Nadie como tú; además de un Screen Saver para PC. Se trata de pop fresco y juvenil, capaz de capturar rápidamente a las adolescentes. Si estuvieras junto a mi, Gitana y Mi Tesoro son títulos capaces de hacerlas suspirar, más no así a un público adulto."
2,Too much,"La música y el concepto del primer álbum del hijo de Charitín tienen grabados la marca de los artistas pop producidos por Emilio Estefan y Jon Secada: ritmos ""latinos"" (que bien podríamos llamar ""de Miami"") en baladas y dance pop, con la diferencia de que la característica principal del disco es la mezcla de ritmos y sonidos orientales con el pop moderno.

3,Good but not worth the price,"If I could only have and read one book on fusing,this would probably be the one. It's more encyclopedic in layout than the other books on fusing that I've read, and covers a number of subtopics.But I can, and do, have other books, and in fact I can buy TWO other very good books on fusing for somewhat less than the price of this one. I've been through this book thoroughly and see no justification for such a high price. I also agree that the proofreading was not very good. This is distracting, and I noticed a couple of paragraphs that are so poorly written that they really don't make any sense.My advice for someone considering this book is to have a look, if possible, at what they're getting for the money before buying."
2,Disappointing,"I was personally very disappointed with the book Contemporary Warm Glass by Brad Walker. Based on the other reviews, I was expecting that the book would live up to its' billing as a comprehensive reference guide. The book itself is very unimpressive for the price at only 8mm thick (a little over ""). The content is very elementary in nature and is definitely geared towards those having little or no knowledge of warm glass. If you are just getting started, this book may be a good addition to your library. However, there are several other books that cover the topic just as well for a lot less money."
5,very pleased with my purchase,"The book arrived on time and in excellent condition. It had a lot of typos in the text, does that mean it was a second? That might explain the lower cost, something that should have been mentioned. However, it was readable and I was satisfied with the purchase."
3,Nice but overpriced,"This is a nicely presented book. The writing style is clear and informative. The pictures are nice, though a little artsy for me to find inspiring. My problem with the book is that I had already gleaned most of what I found in it on the internet - from free and helpful sources. I paid over [money] for this book what with ... I expected to be enthralled, educated and inspired for that amount of money. I was not. Every page was a disappointment - nothing I hadn't already found out. If you don't want to spend the time to ferret out this info on your own, then perhaps the book is worth your money. I, however, am going to be smarting from the loss I took on it for some time to come. At [money], I would have kept it. That's about what I would expect to pay for an arts and crafts book like this one - like many other fine ones I've invested in."
2,Way Too Basic !!!,"This book barely serves as an introduction to warm glass. I found it way too simple, shallow, and not worth more than $15. All the information in this book (and more) can be obtained from warm glass internet sites.I read it in less than 2 hours and was left wanting more in-depth information on techniques, kilns, mold making, grinding, etc."
3,Glass,"This book has a lot of information, but it is mostly geared towards glass blowing. I am a fuser. But still a good reference to have."
5,Debbie Kesling book of miniature bears is wonderful!,"Explaining the hows and wherefores of making any kind of craft item is difficult at best. Especially when you have to do it totally in print. But Debbie Kesling has succeeded beautifully. Not only is this book well written with clear explanations, the photos are beautiful. Anyone even mildly interested in the art of miniature bearmaking will find this book enlightening and entertaining. I have been making miniature bears myself for 7 years and learned a thing or two from Debbie's wonderful book."
5,This book is a Tresure,I was fortuate to have bought this book some years back when it was cheaper. It was quite hard to find then. This is the absolute BEST book on making minature teddy bears. I've not been able to find another book that comes close to it. I've made every single bear in the book and they are great.
4,You'll have to compromise...,"I just installed this keypad over the weekend and I must say I have mixed feelings. As far as the sound quality, it's great. I'm running it off of a Harman/Kardon AVR630 and using Bose 151se outdoor speakers. There is plenty of power and it is very user friendly. However, if you are expecting to use your systems remote you may be in for a suprise. The AVR630 come with a ""Zone2"" remote just for this application but it will not work the volume on the A-kp2. I can adjust radio stations, mute the volume and turn it off but after talking to Russound, I realized you must have A Russound remote to adjust volume. Other than that it appears to be a great product but I may send it back for H/K's keypad."
3,An Intrusting picture of what the world could be.,"This book makes an effort to discribe the Utopian govrernment of a world thatis an image of our own in apperene, buut with people of differing opinions. The ideas are inrusting, but requtre some patience to read through."
1,Bob Lazar: Excerpts from the Government Bible,"Don't bother with this piece of crap. This is coming from someone who is very interested and intrigued with the whole Bob Lazar story. The INFORMATION within is not what makes this a bad choice. This has to be the WORST quality video cassette I have ever had; with the exception of other tapes that were so cheap that any VCR will eat them in the first few seconds. The production is crap, the editing is crap, and Lazar is far from convincing. Consider yourself lucky if you even get any sound coming out of this tape. I did...maybe 33 percent of the time. Word to the wise: Not every video has to be made with expensive equipment with DVD quality picture and sound, but isn't the whole idea to actually get the information across to the viewer! How much more can it really cost the producers to put their material on a quality cassette tape? Pennies? C'mon!"
4,"You'll question what you know of physics, government, etc...","Can you really believe Bob Lazar? Look online for the arguments. There are good ones on both sides which leaves me somewhere in between. To imagine what is discussed as true is a fantastic daydream (perhaps frightening). If curious, it is a must-have, especially if physics is an interest."
1,"""Solved""?????","The only mystery here needing solving is how can seemingly rational, adult individuals believe this nonsense? A Biblical view of human and animal natural history in no way necessitates swallowing this drivel. There isn't one shred of evidence to even suggest that dinosaurs and humans ever co-existed. Not to mention that there is copious evidence that a global flood never occurred. ""In the beginning, God created...."" is something I truly believe,...just not the ICR or AIG version!"

4,Great seller...wrong CD -- my bad !,"A fantastic seller. CD in great condition, and it was delivered very quickly and the price was great. The only problem, I got mixed up and ordered the wrong 80's Greatest Hits CD. That is why only 4 stars, not 5 stars. It's for the songs on the CD, not for the seller. It was my fault, and not the seller's. I give the seller 10 stars !!! A great transaction other than my stupidity..."
4,One of the greatest games,"Persona 2 is a rare gem in today's RPG games despite the popularization of the genre, it's stayed true to its offbeat roots to deliver a story, setting, and style unlike anything you're likely to have played before.I was expecting something, well, less spectacular. I was gladly proven wrong. Definitely one of the greatest games you'll ever play even if it is a PS1 game."
5,"A game good enough to withstand the ""no playstation network entry"" boundary!","I simply could not believe what I witnessed when I first played this game. This is truly a game that can withstand the test of time, because it has a plot-line and elements that seem ahead of their time. The battle system isn't perfect, but anyone with patience and a strategic mind would be well rewarded. I can only wonder why it was never put on PSN, or if the remake is coming to the US, but like Dragon Warrior VII, it is well worth having a PS2/PS1."
4,I wish I played the older games too.,"This game is aweasome. It has a unique battle system, it's not always about fighting, you can talk to the demons you come across too. The graphics are great, cuz the characters actually look like people unlike some other games. The FMVs are all anime styled and has voice acting. I don't know about you guys but I like anime. It may not be like the Final Fantasy series (which are my favourites) but I think I'll play this game for long. The disappointing fact is, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is only the second half of part 2. There was Persona 1 then Persona 2: Innocent Sin. For all I know Innocent sin has not been released in English. Thankies."
4,An acquired taste,"Many will be turned off by Persona 2 because this isn't a Final Fantasy type of game. Persona 2 really isn't a game you can just take out of the box and play. Although I finished both Grandia 2 and Skies of Arcadia without opening up the instruction manual, I had to read Persona 2's manual cover to cover. The reason for a monster instruction manual is, Persona 2 is not a cookie cutter RPG. Aside from the modern day setting and characters that swear like sailors, there are some unique gameplay components like conversing with demons, summoning, and spreading rumors, all of which aren't very intuative. However once you get the hang of the game (especially the battle system), Persona 2 is very fun and completely orginal."
5,"Quite possibly, my favorite RPG.","This is truly on of the greatest RPG's on a console. It has a modern setting, dark story, and truly challenging combat. Although the 'monster collection' aspect may turn off some. The endless mazes (although automapping is some help) do make the game a little tedious, as do the endless character voicings. But the beautiful interactions between characters (even at the end, I was stumped with regards as to who would pair up), the difficult combat that really requires strategy, and the huge amount of 'essential' items to collect make this one a must have."
4,I love it.,"Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is the only game of the whole series of Persona I could find. Though, There is no need to play the older series before. What I really like in this game are the music, the story and the characters. I think that the battle system is quite annoying. And it's kinda hard to gain the EXPs, also. This game is not an original RPG where dragons and swords rule the world, it takes place in the present time, so be ware if you didn't. There are stores, sushi bar, clinic, CDs store, parks, just like what you've seen in this world. But it's not that simple, mystic stuff can be found in this game also, rumors, fortune tellings, demons, and personas. You can say that this is the world where facts and fictions go together. The voice actings are easy to listen and understand, also matches each character's personality and looks (although the joker guy's is quite comic relief). If you enjoy serious, creepy and unique stories, get this game."
3,Vol. 3 Traces of Death,"I received my Vol. 3 tape Saturday, the video was ok. I watched it all the way through. I felt sorry for the victums... It's difficult to actually realize that things like that, do go on like that in the world. But watching the video, (I don't want to sound morbid), but I didn't get the feeling, that I just couldn't bare watching anymore. Perhaps, thats due -to- not really getting emotionally into the video. Alot of the scenes went by pretty quick, and then it was onto another torture, or topic. I know I usually cry at sad movies, but then some movies bring you right into them, as though you were there, or knew the person. I believe (in my opinion) the (?) music, or sounds in the background, although ear-ee, was sort of a distraction. But it was ok.."
5,Purple People Eater VHS,"Ive been looking for a copy of this movie for ages! It was one of my favorites as a kid, so finding a copy on here for a reasonable price was awesome! The overall quality was great and I am very satisfied with this purchase. I would definately buy more titles from this seller! Thank you!!!"

2,white sheets,These sheets are just a plain white fitted sheet and plain white top sheet with a vikings pillow case. I could have bought similar sheets for about $15. The only thing that makes them 'Vikings' sheets is the pillow case. A serious rip off.
3,"I liked it, I just didn't love it....","This is an interesting twist on the Cinderella story in that Cinderella isn't poor just untitled. The characters and plot were interesting and the sub characters will surely have books of their own and rightly so. However, this book was just a little blah for me. There were too many things going on to really feel that the book was cohesive. While I enjoyed the characters chemistry it was, at times, sickeningly sweet and a bit unbelievable. Overall a decent read, but not a favorite."
