4,A must buy for horror fans,"3 dollars! Every horror fan should own a copy of this book which is a perfect introduction to Campbells quite dense, detailed and inherently eerie style of writing. If your bored with King and want to try something new you could do MUCH worse then spend a few precious dollars of this collection od subtle horror stories."
4,rainbow feeder,This feeder works very well if You only use small pellet food. (I dont recommend flakes). I modified the hopper to eliminate binding. I made a bracket to raise the height of the feeder to avoid moisture from condensation and fish splashing ( which can prevent the food from falling out of the feeder). I only fill the left and right hopper chambers to avoid over working the feeder. I feed once a day and it lasts Me 53 days. Great for My RV trips.
5,Essential!,"This is the best book of idioms I have found. The book is organized alphabetically with both English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English sections. I found it extremely useful during my trip to South America.I studied Spanish in Buenos Aires, and my teacher was so impressed with the book, she asked that I send her a copy from the US. Without a knowledge of idioms, conversations become dull and and it is difficult to read Spanish newspapers. You can't beat the book's comprehensive coverage. And you certainly can't beat the price!"
3,Ok book,"This is a good reference book to have in your library. It didn't appear to have a lot of modern phrases in it, some that I hear often. Overall it will give you a good base. I'd suggest you buy a used copy."
2,Magic Street-Orson Scott Card,"Disappointing. Didn't hold my interest. Characters very vague. Point of view seemed shiftly, mostly the author's thoughts and ideas."
3,Disappointing from Card,"I enjoyed the book, as an entertaining read. I love books that tie in other stories (part of why Card's take on Sleeping Beauty, Enchantment, is one of my favorite books), and this one was a modern day play on Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. That said, the book didn't have the level of emotional hostage-taking of Ender's Game, nor the pure fantastical magic of Enchantment. Perhaps I had a hard time swallowing the white descended-from-Brigham-Young Mormon telling a story about a middle class black neighborhood. The ""niggah""s and ""gangsta""s, and ebonics, felt a little forced.And, I didn't care for the ending.Anyway, I was disappointed. Had it come from another author, I might have enjoyed it more, but I suppose I expect better from Card."
3,Interesting premise,"Interesting premise, dynamic characters, and some witty dialogue makes this book worth a second look, but it is not Mr Card's best effort. An unsatisfying ending left me wishing for a different way to end the book. The middle dragged. Still, having African American protagonists in a fantasy fiction was new, different and exciting, and the idea of this particular fantasy world was also unique."
3,Ok...that was a bit odd...,"What a strange modern day fantasy. Although compelling, I finished the book with a puzzled thought, ""What really was the point of this story?"". I'd say the story was about the mystical realm viewed only from the distant corner of our eye and the ever plight of fairies, but I think it really was more about how a small community deals with what society has given and taught them and how they should react to each other in a time of crisis. I do have to say it was an interesting twist to bring to life A Midsummer Night's Dream in today's world."
2,"unfortunately, it's a pointless read","I am sorry to say that this is an entirely pointless read. Very disappointing, but I honestly find that none of Card's books live up to his achievement in Ender's Game."
1,You can by the paper back under $4...,"Wow - anyone want to explain why Amazon is ripping us off on Kindle versions? Let's see - no paper, glue, employees...brick and mortar store to pay for but you charge $11.99 for the Kindle version when you can by the Paperback NEW for only $4. This is just stupid - we are being ripped off!!!"
3,Alvin Maker light,"I liked _Magic Street_ a lot, but something kept nagging at me as I was reading: I felt like I'd encountered these characters before. Then it struck me--the book is not much more than a mishmash of Card's Alvin Maker series. I mean, bear with me on this. Mack Street is basically Arthur Stuart in disguise. Cecil ""Ceese"" Tucker is Alvin (one thing Card has done is to switch around who has the power, so that Mack/Arthur is the one with the magical abilities). Word Williams is basically Calvin Maker in disguise. Yolanda/Yo Yo/Titania could be any number of magical entities, but most resembles Tecumsah, the Red Prophet. And so forth and so on. I liked _Magic Street_, but I'd much rather be reading the next Alvin book and wish Card wasn't so bent on recycling. Also, no more Ender books--this is a series that has really played itself out."
4,A well told story. Imaginative.,"This is not a scifi or fantasy novel and not what I expected from this author. It is however a well told story as are the other novels that Card has written. This one is about magic. Its set in Baldwin Hills, California. Based on the descriptions in the story and in the Acknowledgements section at the end I can even look at the location for the story on Google Earth."
2,yah..,"I like Orson Scott Card.. but when he starts talking about black people I just want to cringe. I'm still in the process of reading the book as it's just one of those you can't put down even if you try to. As a black person I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone who doesn't truly understand the black culture as this might give someone an off representation about how it really is to be black. It seems like Card tried really hard to get his characters right and I think it was nice of him to try... I think he just tried too hard to address racial and age related issues. The actual story is pretty intriguing if you're able to get past everything else... Read it if you'd like, but just remember that these are characters and not real people. Honestly, black people don't really think about their color all the time. They only think of it when they're reminded of it."
4,"Weird, but good","This book definitely has a different feel than most Card books. The fantasy element is kind of similar to ""Enchantment"" but it goes another level or two deeper and weirder. Not that weird is bad, it's just different. I enjoyed it - it pulled me along to the end and made me think. I thought the African-American elements of the book were a little forced - almost as if there were parts of the book that Card just wanted to remind us ""Remember this book is about African-Americans!"", but it's not too distracting. Overall I would recommend it to all Card fans, but if you haven't read much Card, there are better places to start.You can access the first five chapters of the book at hatrack dot com. That preview will give you a pretty good idea of what the book is like without having to buy it."
4,Great pillow for the price,Great little pillow. Soft and comfortable. Bought it for moms birthday. Only 25$ (other similar items are 50$+) I have a temperpedic pillow and the quality of this little pillow isnt too far behind. Great product!
3,Heavy and a little hard,"This pillow is made from the more dense, less molding version of foam. It does not work well with airplane seats, as the portion behind the neck is too thick."
2,SONGS ARE EDITED!!!!,"La Bel Age loses a whole minute!!!! Painted Desert is 20 seconds shorter than on the original CD, and Invincible is 10 seconds shorter. The bonus track, Love is a Battlefield, it is the 7"" version, not the full length version on her Live from Earth CD (this due to the fact that Love is a Battlefield was released at a very different time overseas, and this import matches that version of the releases). They should have just left it off the CD and given us back the time stolen from the other tracks!!! What a bummer. Otherwise, I'm all for this 2 in 1 compilation idea."
2,BGO Come on....,"Just to let you know, this is now available only as a pro-pressed CD-R. I opened my copy today and was a bit miffed, though it sounds decent. Just full price is not worth a pro-pressed CD-R,...."
1,She's Always Been a Blondie Wannabee,I've liked several of Pat's recordings but this one just dosen't measure up to the others. Pat Benetar owes her whole career to Deborah Harry and Blondie who pushed the door open for her. While Pat is definetly the superior vocal technician as she shows on this disc...Deborah wins hands down for coolness and attitude.
1,"Very, Very poor book","This book is too broad. It is nearly impossible to find charts and tables, and it does not leave the user with an impression of understanding. Equasions are buried unders lines of text and are not pointed out or highlighted. Reader must pour through several paragraphs to discover the meanings of pictures, charts and diagrams. Vital information hard to find. Not a very good book for referencing, or quick study. Does not convey abstract concepts and ideas well. Only buy this book if you want some very in-depth reading."
4,An excellent introduction to basic PChem.,"In 1969 I graduated with a BS in Chemistry. When I compare my Sienko and Plane 101 textbook with Chang's I feel like I'm reading an introductory book in Physical Chemistry. Lately I'm reviewing a lot of topics I have learned years ago, and, for Chemistry, I have chosen this book. It is full of accounts relating this science to everyday experience, besides it contains many learning paradigms never applied in texbooks of yesteryear. I feel that I have in my hands a serious and entertaining book which is bringing me up to date with my first academic love, Chemistry. If I want a deeper look to a topic, I still pick Castellan. For an edition of the book with the use of Calculus I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Chemical engineering student,"I used this book for 3 quarters of general chemistry. Its an ok book, as I use it quite alot for my organic chemistry lab work. My school bookstore ordered the paperback ""custom"" version of this book, which I think is retarded because most chemistry / chemical engineering students are going to want to keep their chemistry books for future class and or job reference. A paper back just isnt going to cut it, and I am going to have to repurchase this book as a hard back. That fact that I plan to repurchase this book as opposed to finding another is proof enough of its value. As a second choice, I think the Brown / Lemay chemistry book is just as good of a choice."
1,Absolutely Miserable,"Absolutely miserable book. Vague and confusing, does not thoroughly explain anything. Jumps from topic to topic; leaves reader wondering where the the information came from. Currently using it as high school text book in honors Chem; most peers think it's only use is as kindling."
1,do yourself a favor and find a copy of zumdahl's book,"this book is the pits (it is actually worse than that). had i depended on this book to pass chemistry i would have failed SO i found an old copy of zumdahl's and everything became so much easier.i am sure this is a fine book if you do not need to pass a class. it can be pretty entertaining, but if you need to learn something save your money."
1,Chemistry 7th Edition,"This book was absolutely horrible. Beyond the many typos and mathematical errors, the author skips around between topics and never really gets to the point. All of the example problems are great if your instructor only gives you problems using standard volumes, temperatures and pressures (unlike the end of chapter exercises). I normally keep my books, but this one is going at the end of the semester!"
3,Disappointment,"If you are looking for some ideas maybe this is ok but visual execution is not inspiring (video quality is ok and people are good looking): some positions are clearly acted not done actually. I sold this away after couple of days. I've seen better done under category ""kama sutra"""
2,matthew,"the dvd is top quality . the only thing i didn't like about is about 80 percent of the position they have on there either use bar stool,small table nothing you could use bedroom setting ."
1,This wasn't what I thought it was,This is a very interesting dvd. But it wasn't what I thought it was don't waste your money on this. Donna
5,Strong Arm 4536,"The Strong Arm lift supports were a direct replacement for the OEM parts. They're not an exact OEM match, but I prefer the Strong Arm design. The two ball joints of the OEM design are built-in to the lifts, which make them just a bit more difficult to remove. The ball joints of the Strong Arm lift are independent of the lift, and after tightening the ball joints into the frame of the car and the frame of the hood, the ends of the lift simply snap onto the ball joints. Overall the removal and installation took about 20 minutes."
5,"Worked perfectly, 10 minutes to install",Purchased these for my 2003 Lexus GS300. It took longer to find my wrenches than to actually do the install. Each hood shock came with their mounts and I had no issues whatsoever. Easy and well worth the price!
3,"Great Product so far, but missing pieces...","My Lexus GS300's hood lift supports were not holding up my hood at all. I search around for great lift supports and ran into the Strong Arm lifts and ordered 2. They arrived as expected, and installation was very easy and simple. I was only able to install 1 of the lift supports. The other lift support only brought 1 nut that screws into the hood. I had to go to the local Auto Zone and purchase another nut to screw the lift support into the car, which was a bit of an inconvenience since I was expecting a complete set and this is clearly an mistake by the seller.The 1 lift support I was able to install works tremendously well and is capable of holding up the hood by itself."
5,Easy To Install,"Just prop up your hood with a support, a broom, stick, I used a ski pole...lol and take the old ones out. I greased each cup, then installed one ball into the angled cup and threaded it into the hood but not tight. Then threaded the second ball into the fender and popped it into place on the support. You may have to twist and pull to line everything into place but no big deal. Make sure you tighten all connections. Works great and easy to do. You will find you'll need a 12mm and a 7/16 wrench. The Lexus OEM is in ""mm"" and the replacement support connection is in inches. A simple repair."
4,"Exact Length and Strong Lift, But . . .","The struts came sealed with each in a plastic bag. I opened the first one carefully and found only a strut. No other pieces. So I looked at Lexus forums and found that some suppliers don't include the ball head bolt. I cut out the old ones in a few minutes but someone without the proper tools would have been lost here. I installed the first one then opened the second one. That bag contained two new ball head bolts! I KNOW I did not lose the bolts from the first strut. Anyhow, after all was done, they work great."
2,Best for lessons or small groups,"This is written more for reader's theater than in performance style. So unless you're very creative and can re-write, I would pass. This would be good for Sunday School lessons where you can go right to the appropriate verses to follow up. Not the best for just performance."
4,Helpful Resource,"The book is split into 26 Old Testament and 26 New Testament monologues. There are parts for 18 women and 34 men. Each drama has Scriptural references, reflections, and suggested hymns to go along with it. Some characters don't seem to be fleshed out very well, but with a bit of personalization from the individual actor, they work well. For the most part, it's a great resource."
4,A Work for Basic Insights and Interests,"As one who has written and directed several dramas for my church, I found this work both interesting and useful although quite basic. Osbeck has done a credible job of identifying and summarizing the 52 Biblical characters portrayed. For an experienced director they are somewhat elementary and could require significnt additional research and editing before using. This reader found them much more narrative and informative than directly suitable for dramatic presentation. I compliment Osbeck on his work and do recommend it highly as an excellent starting point to learn of these 52 Biblical characters. Osbeck's work could be quite useful as reference material for ministers pursuing a series of sermons on topics such as: Women of the Bible, Great Biblical Leaders, The Prophets of the Bible, etc. Dr. D."
4,Bible teacher,This is a very good resource to make Bible classes a little more interesting to middle school age students.
4,"""Now what are you doing, Junior?""","In the book The Not Just Anybody Family, Junior was jumping off their barn and in the book, The Blossoms Meet the Vulture Lady, Junior is up to something again. I would say that this book is a 5th or 6th grade reading level. One more thing, the vulture lady's name is Mad Mary but she is not mad. Read this book if you like the Blossoms and their weird adventures."
4,What a wonderful life!,"Luci's appreciation of the gift of life is to be admired. We can all take a lesson from her challenges and victories in her walk with God, family, and friends...this book is a wonderful gift to us."
4,Excellent music theory text,"I have used this text successfully for several years with first-year college theory students, both in the classroom and in directed study. It offers many clear examples and a variety of exercises for students to complete. I intend to continue using it and would recommend it not only as a classroom text but as a vehicle for independent study for practicing musicians without an extensive knowledge of music theory."
4,Good Theory Book,"This is a great basic theory book perfect for those who want to know more about music theory, and also for those pursuing a career in music. Covers a lot of basic classical theory so you can get started in understanding the fundamentals of music. Great reference book for musicians, as well. Whether you play guitar, sing, or even if you're just an avid music listener, this book will help you understand a little bit more what you're listening to or playing."
4,Practical Use,"I was originally taught music theory from an impractical text. The descriptions were not very straightforward and seemed calculated to make the writers sound refined. Now I'm using Music: In Theory and Practice to review my knowledge, and it's so much better! Descriptions are plain, without nonsense, and the function of music is presented clearly. If I'm not mistaken, my father used an earlier edition of this good text for college in the 1960s. Clean, streamlined, sensible, and time-tested, this product is commendable."
1,magellan power card,"The prongs on the reciever end does not make good contact. I can get the GPS to work as long as I dont move it around. Screw that holds it on the GPS, bottoms out before it touches the contacts."
3,Second choice Ok,The product works well and the transaction with Amazon is great as always. What I needed was this cable with a computer adapter included but apparently there are none available.
1,Not a quality product!,"This power cable was used on my ATV to eliminate the need for a battery when travelling in the outback. Before the end of the first Summer I could hear a rattle in the small plastic box in the middle of the cable (the power supply regulator) and the adapter no longer worked.Since I am a Tech. and used to fixing things in the field, I pried the box apart and found that a small coil had seperated from the circuit board but as handy as I am I could not repair this unit.The ATV had never been used on very rough terrain and the Magellan GPS unit itself worked just fine so rough usage was not a problem. My conclusion was that this was a very poorly constructed power cable and I would not own and depend on another."
5,Works Like it Should,I mean its a cord that plugs in a cigarette lighter socket what else is there to say.
3,Business owner,"Power adaptor works well, but I have reservations due to the cheap plastic. It is great so far."
1,Back to the days of swapping floppies,With all the CD swapping it is almost not worth owning. It is cool being able to search across all those years but the CD swapping ruins the experience completely.
4,Solid Non-technical commentary,"As has been noted in other reviews. This commentary is written from a conservative evangelical position. It was also written for those who have not mastered the Greek language, and who are not familiar with technical hermeneutics and exegetical methods. So, if you need that, go to Wm. Lane's Word Biblical Commentary. But, if you just simply want to know, ""What does the text teach me about God, and how I should respond?"" then Brown is very helpful. Good for Bible study leaders and basic sermon prep. Others authors to look at on Hebrews would be, F.F. Bruce and particularly Philip E. Hughes."
3,Brief and Helpful,"The Bible Speaks Today series is a brief and helpful commmentary series. The Message of Hebrews fits well into the series. It's outline of the book is forced at times, but it's commentary is good."
1,Mislead,"This book is not written by THE Raymond Edward Brown, the same Scripture scholar who wrote the Death of the Messiah, the Birth of the Messiah, co-edited the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, and many other classics.This book is a very different level of scholarship and written from a very different viewpoint than that held by the late Raymond E. Brown, S.S., a giant among Scripture scholars of the late 20th century.It is unfortunate that you have these two authors grouped together. I was quite disappointed to discover your error when I acquired the book."
2,Cheap smell,"Received it as a gift from an aunt in Asia. Apparently, they don't sell this in US anymore. Scent is nothing really special. It smells a lot like other colognes in the market. One can say that it smells quite cheap, and strong at first. Scent does not last all day either. No one ever offered any compliments. I think I am gonna stick with Lacoste Essential."
4,"Good product, but needs appropriate measurement labeling","The only thing that stopped me from giving these a 5-star rating is the lack of true measuring increments on each spoon. The spoons themselves are of perfectly good quality, but if ""laffin_boy"" (see other reviewers of this product) had not done extensive research with a syringe to figure out that Norpro's ""pinch"" equals 1/16 of a teaspoon, their ""dash"" equals 1/12 teaspoon, etc., I would never have bought them. I printed out laffin-boy's measuring chart from his Amazon review, and when I got the spoons, took an electric engraver and engraved the correct fractions on the back of each spoon handle. NOW they fulfill the purpose for which I bought them......to precisely measure out 1/16 teaspoon of a progesterone cream, to which I am very sensitive. It took many months to figure out JUST the right twice-a-day dosage for me. Now I don't have to fight to try to fill one-eighth of a teaspoon halfway. Thanks for your helpful post, laffin_boy."
4,not as nice,"I like the ekco set more, but this set has 5 pieces.oval not round spoons. Just my opinion. Mice set"
5,Not for measuring,"The description is a little misleading. As measuring spoons, these things are kind of useless because of the strange (yet amusing) choices in labeling, but as tools for scooping BYOB supplements onto a scale, they're great. You have the large ones for things that require larger doses and the small ones for things that require lower doses.I now spend less time dumping my supplements back into the container for re-weighing thanks to these spoons."
3,actual measurements a little odd,"I bought these mini measure spoons to measure medicine for my small puppy and because there were 5 in the set as opposed to the others for sale that have three or four per set. The actual measurements come out a bit strange...., when carefully checked against my standard teaspoon measure are as follows. 1/5 tsp, 1/11 tsp, 1/16 tsp, 1/32 tsp, 1/64 tsp.I will use them and I scratched the actual measurements into the handle so I would remember.I hope this helps others who are considering the purchase."
5,Odd size measuring spoons,"The spoons were a gift for someone who says she can't cook ""by taste"", which is how she has been given some recipes. The recipes call for a smidgen or a dash and she has no idea how much that is. These measuring spoons fit the bill perfectly. She was very pleased with her gift."
3,Twice as big as they should be,"These spoons are 2x as big as they should be - a tad is 1/8 tsp, these have it at 1/4 - and so on down, each one is 2x what it should be. Would I had known... I need a REAL drop... 1/128 tsp. At least Amazon gets 5 stars, ordered late on Thursday, in hand Saturday afternoon, 2 day shipping included w/Prime."
4,Great price for small measurements,Good purchase for measuring small amounts of strong herbs or spices. Would be better if marked by fraction of teaspoon. Luckily Amazon reviewer had this info available so I could engrave mini-spoons.
4,Works Great,"Same comment as many others. A fifth star to the spoons that actually have the fractional teaspoon measurements printed alongside the drop, dash..."
5,Great gift!,I bought a couple of these to give to my friends who cook a lot but don't have the smaller sizes to use on the older recipies. Quality is great. May have to buy more for others I know.
4,Norpro 3080 Mini Measuring Spoons,"An awesome deal. They are really helpful for dealing with small substances. My only compliant is they have measurements such as a dose, pinch, ect... not precise at all. But if that does not bother you, great product!"
1,5 Pieces - NOT!,"The item I rcvd was *not* the one described or pictured. The set of spoons I rcvd was only *3* pieces, even though the plastic bag that the set was wrapped in said it was a *5* piece set. We've owned a 3 piece set of these spoons for several years & like it very much. Am very disappointed, since we were particularly interested in the extra 2 spoons that are supposed to be in this set."
1,Cutesy Measurements Not So Cute,Well for starters it cost almost as much to ship these measuring spoons than the initial purchase. Then upon opening the package I find them to have this cutesymeasurements. I ordered these to measure out powders and cutesy just doesn't cut it. I did read the reviews but obviously not close enough. Sadly they are useless to me.
1,"Measuring spoons without measurements, ridiculous!","Measuring spoons without measurements, ridiculous!________ ______ __ _____ _____ _____ ______ _____ _____ ____ ____ ____ ___ _ ___ _ __ __ __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _"
4,Little Spoons,"I ordered 2 sets of these spoons. They are great. I only wish for one thing, that they had the teaspoon equivalents on it. I have to look them up. But I was so happy to find them."
1,What a piece of cr%#!,"Please do not buy this dismal excuse for an educational video. It consists of a string of loud (yet mumbled!) songs throwing around a bunch of terminology. It attemps to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds. There is little or no development of any topic. Worse, the songs are colossally annoying. I can't believe I paid almost twenty bucks for this disaster. My poor children looked like they were shellshocked. Ugh!"
3,"Only for Reinforcement of Material - a review of Squibs ""Matter: Atoms, Elements, and Chemistry""","Three Stars [C-] ::: This is a lively video that should only be used for reinforcement of material that has already been previously covered. It talks about state changes, atomic structure, litmus paper, and the period chart, etc., but it does NOT teach children about any of these topics. There is no systematic approach nor any introduction to the material covered. The video 'just jumps in there' and the best you could say about the DVD is that it offers children alternative ways to memorize and visualize the material using a cartoon format and songs.Pam T~"
3,Essentially a textbook,"This book tells you a lot of interesting and important things about storyboarding, but it's really a commercial textbook. It even has exercise sections and notes from the author on how teachers can use this book for lesson plans. However, like I've said, it can be useful."
2,I am disappointed by the amateur drawings,"It is a okay book for people really want to take a look at storyboarding, especially those concepts. You will have a clear idea about storyboarding after reading this book.However, I am disappointed when I first open it and I never looked at it before I gave it away.The drawings are too amateur to me. It's hard to find a good illustration by someone with 3 years serious practising in this book. I am not willing to learn by looking at those kid's drawings."
4,Awesome,"My book arrived on time! The pages were slightly folder, but other than that, it was great! I bought it used, but it looked better than I expected."
4,Fight to Survive!,"The time is the barbaric future and you have to take up a militant profession to survive and live well.Warriors, pick up a sword, a club or a rope and enter the Battle Circle to show your skills!This is one of Anthony's seldom-talked-about-book and difficult to find in bookshops (at least in Singapore and Malaysia)compared to some of his other titles. Hey, even amazon.com has only a used copy for sale!The trilogy trails the stories of Sos The Rope, Var The Stick and Neq The Sword (no prizes for guessing what weapons they use), with the tale turning from just another military fantasy type yarn, to post-Apocalypse sci-fi in an interesting manner."
3,This album is fine!,"Despite the negative comments certain people have left, I believe this album to be fine. It's very atmospheric and the vocals don't sound too much different. It's a first release, so obviously it isnt as good as some of their later albums but really it isnt that bad. And in response to that comment about the keyboards sounding like carnival music: They definitely do not. Far from carnival music actually. Guess that person doesnt know his sounds very well."
5,Evil!,Cradle of Filth in the old days. Not to be compared with their newer and 'cleaned' work but this certainly doesn't mean it is of poor quality. It's a great album that makes you shiver. An album for all the evil ones that dwell on this earth!
3,Evil but... not so clear,This is an alright album. Albeit not the best of there work but still nice tolisten to if u don't mind low quality. The recording could have been lots better but its a decent sound
2,Inexplicably overrated,"Cradle of Filth has got to be the most overrated band of all time. Just looking at the rating they have here on Amazon is a good indicator of that.Note to everyone: do NOT buy this album. There are better albums out there. If you want good black metal, perhaps Emperor's ""Nightside Eclipse"" is a better place to start.Seriously, I'm warning you, this album sucks."
1,This album is a joke - More cheese than a cheeseburger,"I heard this album when it first came out and it made me laugh so hard back then. I honestly cant believe so many people have left positive reviews on such a horrible sounding album. The keyboards sound like carnival music !!!!!This isnt heavy, this isnt *evil*; its laughable.If you want good music, do not pick this up."
5,Absolutly awesome,"When it comes to Cradle of Filth, you either love it or hate it. For those that hate it. Bite me and go read a 98 Degrees review. But for those that love it, this is a must own. I got it a few months ago and it sounds better and better every time i listen to it. It contains instrumentals (very cradilish)that are almost celestial sounding. My mom walked in my room once while the track One Final Graven Kiss was on and asked me ""whats this pretty music, i like this."" Then of course, it contains good ol songs with thrashing beats and shreiking vocals. If you like all the gothic elements twisted with, in your face, metal then you need to get this now. my favorite song is Of Mist and Midnight Skies(which may be my fav. cradle song of all) that has a part in it where Dani screams an obscenety involving jesus christ. if you like that kind of anti-religious (to say the least) message, like me, then you will know why i like such a track and CD as this."
1,These Guys are NOT BLACK METAL don't be fooled!!!!,"I can't stand these guys, this music is for sexually dysfunctional teenagers only.I can't hardly stand to type anymore this is not black metal or death metal so if that's what you're looking for steer clear and try some Immortal,Emperor,Bathory, or Mayhem if you can stand the stupid thoughtless satanic Lyrics or if death metal's you're bag check out morbid angel,Death,or even some OLD Mortification(the first 3 or 4 cd's).This and anything else I've ever heard by them is garbage!!! Demon burger (dimmu Borgir) is better than this and that doesn't say much.I'm not against sunth in metal either as long as it's done right,check out emperor or children of Bodom if that's your thing."
1,Would love to have help to assemble...,"I am surprised people said this is ""easy to assemble"". Although no tools are required, the parts slip out of their holes very easily. Need too many hands to keep it to together during assembly. Not sure it is worth the effort. Was hoping to have it ready for my husband when he got home from work, but will need his help.Would love to know how people assembled it so quickly."
4,4 shelf greenhouse,Everything was ok about this product except for the plastic cover which one of the zippers broke when trying to zip it close. The plastic cover was to tight of a fit and sewn poorly.
3,Good but could be better,"The software is easy to use but I wish that it had more lake detail. I am an avid fisherman and wish that the lake maps had depth information available on them. The road information that I have used from the maps is very accurate and the maps are easy to use, lots of detail!! Uploading the maps to my receiver was easy. You just need to allow for extra time for the process. The best bet would be to upload the night before a trip. Overall it is a good product considering it covers the entire United States."
3,Is this product obsolete?,"It looks like Magellan just released a new version. Magellan says MapSend DirectRoute uses data from NavTech, which should fix the inaccuracy problems. Have any of you disgruntled MapSend users shelled out the hundred bucks to upgrade to DirectRoute? I intend to wait until a few reviews appear before upgrading."
2,Low detail maps and low accuracy,"I compared my GPS to maps from Topozone.com and my Meridian GPS is accurate - it's the Magellan map and software that is off by 500-1000 ft. The Topo software is really not supposed to be a streets program, so I can sort'a forgive the out of date street maps - they seem to be at least 10 or 12 years old. Street maps are also low resolution 'stick' maps; not even close to the picture shown on the CD case. I like the GPS, and the software came as a bundle for ... If I had paid MSRP I would have demanded my money back. Magellan really should update this program."
1,MapSend Topo,"I bought this software thinking it was great...WRONG...the disc locks up and will not load, the company will not return my e-mails or phone calls, now I am out 100.00 and have a useless disc...Buy the DeLorme products, they won't load with your Magellan GPS, but get rid of it too and get one that is compatible with DeLorme products...they are much better quality"
2,Sent wrong product,"They sent me the wrong product. Can only communicate through emails. They did pay for return shipping but still lost money on the transaction (had to pay for a box). Won't buy from them again, a company that has no phone number doesn't have one for a reason!"
2,Mapsend with explorist,"Megellan, has indicated on many occassions that they were going to provide a update so regions could be uploade to an explorist 500, but has not, and in order to do this, they are forcing customers to buy another product.Last time Megellan buyer."
1,"Inaccurate, lousy support, no updates","While I really like my Magellan Platinum GPS receiver, I find that the Mapsend Topo software is worse than having no detail map loaded at all. The maps loaded by the software are pretty consistently wrong by about 200m. In most situations, this will get you DANGEROUSLY lost.The GPS itself is generally very accurate, so if you put in waypoints from a real mapping program, like the National Geographic TOPO! Series, you'll get where you need to be. Using the Magellan software, unless you know how far off it is where you are, can be outright dangerous.My worst experience with this was trying to navigate jungle on Kauai, but I have found it no better, in terms of accuracy (but the fact that you can see the terrain makes it less of a problem) in Southern CA and Northern Baja.The software also has not been updated in over 2 years, and no update info is available on Magellan's site."
1,a very very bad product from Magellan,"As a matter of fact, maps are almost all inaccurate, from 100 to about 1000 feet. Also, the software itself is outdated. It looks like a Windows 95 software. Regarless how many times people positively reviewed it, Mapsend is unarguably not as good as the Magellan GPS units: I personally purchased the Meridian platinum. But what is the purpose of having a good GPS if the software does not compute routes accordingly?In addition, uploading maps into the unit is not as easy as I would have expected.Of course, this software will never compete with an expensive OEM Car Navigation System (Navtech is producing all the maps for almost all car navigation system, Magellan is not using Navtech maps) The first purpose of the handheld GPS is outdoor, not driving. But for the most part, hiking trails are omitted, this is the biggest shortcoming. What does Magellan believe an outdoor GPS is made for? back and forth?DON'T BOTHER"
2,"Outdated, Inaccurate, Expensive","-Outdated:Street data is at least 3 years old, based on known construction dates for roads in my area (N. Dallas, TX). Both major roads and secondary roads are missing.-Inaccurate:Streets, trails, intersections, and points of interest are usually off by 100 yards or more. This makes the software essentially useless for navigation.Search by address feature generally places bullseye 10-15 addresses away from correct spot.On the positive side: Elevation data is very accurate."
2,Inaccurate,"Like other reviewers have said, I found the GPS off by 50-500 feet. That made it much less useful to me. Now I will try a Garmin GPS-V. I will post this review in the GPS section too. When I did my research I didn't think to look at the software reviews, just the hardware ones. I liked everything about the GPS except the accuracy issue."
3,Doesn't Work on Windows XP (updated),"[Previously I had reported the error message ""cannot open search tools, program will exit""]I have it running on XP now. The problem appears to be relatedto some anti-virus software that is on all of the XP machines I tried.This is the first program I've ever used that has required me to disable anti-virus software in order to get it to run."
4,Map Send Topo We miss the trails,"Topo map is great. But do not count on finding any trails, say Hiking trails. This is the weakness of it. I live in New England, NH more precisely, and guess what : Apalachian trail, every hiker knows it, just try to find it in Topo. Good luck.This put aside this is a great tool.Yves"
2,MapSend Topo Limitations,"There are two limitations I've encountered in the very short time of use. Item #1 - The implamentation of the GPS to the software is very poor. Apperently MapSend, Streets and Topo, were written for the 330 GPS unit. Magellan has chosen to use the same software for the Meridian series. As a result, it's not a very clean solution. There are many work-arounds and bandaids just to get it to work. Most inconvenient! Item #2 - For the most part, hiking trails are omitted. Even the most popular trails here in the NW are not to be found in Topo. Question - Why else would one by a topo software package if not to see and locate trails?I've only had this software for one week and to find these two problems so quickly, leads me to believe I've yet to find additional limitations.Phil"
2,MapSend Topo Review,"I've had MapSend Topo for about a week now and I'm not impressed with it for the following reasons: 1. Doesn't contain trails. Why would anyone purchase a topo software package and not want trails? Big oversight by Magellan. 2. Doesn't recognize new zip codes or towns. I've had my zip code for almost 4 years...Topo says it's invalid. Can't find my friend's zip in VA either. One would think that Magellan would have up-grades on their web site that would up-date things like cities and zip codes. By the way, it's the same for MapSend Streets. 3. Too many bandaids and work-arounds to get a map into the GPS. Lots of rules here. No maps larger that 8Meg and only 4 of those or the GPS unit will lock-up. Haven't tried that yet but I'll take Magellan's word on it...By the way, it does work with WindowsXP. No problems there for me."
1,Magellan should stop selling this product until...,"it fixes its accuracy problems. After loading my Meridian Platinum with a map of the Hawaiian island chain, I eagerly looked forward to using my GPS on vacation. Unfortunately I found it to be consistently off by a few hundred yards. After emailing Magellan to find out what I could do they replied:""Mr. ******,The Topo software does have the error of sometimes will place you off your course. Unfortunately, we do not have a date on when an update will be available."" (sic)I had to remove the memory card and rely on just the basemap as it was annoying to be constantly off course. Don' think I will be loading up maps to climb mountains!To Magellan: this is a BUG, and a major one, please fix it before selling anymore units"
4,Warning !!!,I just purchased this mapsend (topo) software. The maps are very good so far. When you open the box DO NOT follow their directions if you have a Meridian unit !!! Do NOT load the base map as it will turn your unit into a Map 330 unit and it will crash and need to be replaced per Magellan. While looking at the maps on my computer I found the detail quite satisfactory. They show all the info I was looking for and then some. If you know how to read a topo map you should find these to your liking. One other drawback that they are working on is the file size that can be downloaded to the unit. It is only 32MB. They are working on a patch for this problem though. For ease of use you may want to get an SD card reader to speed up the download process. You don't need to connect your gps unit to the computer this way.
1,Careful!,"Be sure you understand that the Topo maps on this CD do not contain trails like USGS 7.5 minute topo maps before you spend the money to buy it!! Granted, some trails are on the maps, but generally only if they are the size of 4WD jeep roads. Most trails less than that didn't make it. Very frustrating for me because I wanted Topo for hiking and mountain biking. I've since found out this problem is not just Magellan - it's all Topo software maps out there, Garmin and others too.If, however, you only want the software to plot trails you've already walked and recorded with the handheld, and then look at elevation change etc., it's probably a good product. But for navigation and planning it's worthless for trails."
2,not compatible with windows XP...,"well since most of us will use this product with XP...considering it is also not compatible with Macintosh either.. I should warn you that after 6-7 hours of screwing around with it, I called customer support and they tried 15-20 different fixes and then came up with... ""oh,you have Windows Xp, we have heard from Microsoft and they are aware of the problem but it won't be fixed until the next version comes out and they haven't started writing it yet.""I guess it is only if you try to use it with the USB conector but I don't have any serial ports on my laptop so it kinds of leaves me out. I didn't know anyone was using serial ports anymore, even my printer has USB...."
2,Magellan mapsend software,"I am a ""serious navigator"" so that's why I bought the meridian platinum to use with the mapsend topo program. The topo maps are totally worthless! When I was climbing this past weekend in the Adirondacks, the unit showed up over three quarters of a mile away from where I actually was! Why did I pay [$$$] dollars for this software when I could do a better job of locating myself by looking on my trail map. Garbage!"
1,"Once more, without feeling","Have you ever been at a High School music concert? The sort where the hip young choir director delivers all sorts of completely inappropriate arrangements, like an acapella madrigal group doing selections from ""Tommy""? If so, you have a slight inkling of what this album is like. It's sort of ""The Lennon Sisters Tribute to Cowboy Music""... with a few bizarre attempts at other genres as well.Now these are four very good voices, no doubt about that. And the classic high school SATB arrangments are competantly done. But the choice of music and the delivery borders on the bizarre. The pinnicle (or perhaps the debacle) of the album, for me, was their attempt to do Jim Pepper's great jazz classic ""Witchi Tai To"". Have you ever heard the Chordette's 1955 recording of ""Mister Sandman""? That's the first thing I thought of when I heard this. Some performances just transcend ordinary judgments of good and bad."
4,"A bit misleading, but still good","Product that was delieverd was from an older publication than preceived to be. Book is in good condition, however, and was shipped fast. Also book is stamped with ""Not For Resale"" on the side of the book."
1,"Why can't these lame-oid programs make up their own names? ""Guada Prime"" is already taken, by something much better!","""Guada Prime"" is the name of a planet, situated to key events for the series 4 finale of ""Blake's 7"". With a plot that has a heck of a lot more depth and intrigue than this cornball-and-not-in-a-good-way, childish, clichéd, videotaped, gaudy, trite, wannabe FLUFF of a ""movie"" - the sort that can be found in 99% of modern ""sci-fi"" already.I saw the trailer and that's more than enough, never mind what else I bothered sitting through - and trust me, even sitting through the trailer is far more than enough to avoid this like the plague. Heck, the plague is vastly preferable by comparison! Worse, there's nothing anybody can do to reclaim the minutes or hours they wasted with this uninspired garbage that rips off a cool name from a totally disparate (and superior) sci-fi property."
5,Wonderful!,"I wish that I had access to this book when I was going through my divorce and staring ""singledom"" in the eye. The book is a wonderful resource for the sorts of issues we face today such as body image, self confidence, careers, etc. The author even gives us follow-up reading material on all of these subjects!While I enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary and A Girl's Guide to Fishing and Hunting, its so refreshing to find a book with a realistic conclusion: happiness has to come from within, not from a man!"
5,The Other Side of Thirty: Musings of a Modern Day Bachelor,"I've recommended this book to ALL my friends; single, divorced, married, in their 20's, 30's or 40's!!! Every woman fortunate enough to get her hands on this book will finish it feeling affirmed and empowered!"
5,"Fun, wise and incredibly well researched!","Ms. Thakor just wowed me. I bought the book after a mutual colleague told me about it. Actually I bought several copies actually, thinking it would be a good gift for my growing list of ""singelton"" friends. I was expecting a Bridget Jones-like approach with a few clever adaptations, I was delighted to be wrong! I loved the more modern medium of email instead of a diary to impart the interesting factoids and painful truths of being a single woman at this time in history. I take public transportation to my job in Chicago and many times while reading this book I laughed out loud or had other audible responses to what I was reading. As further endorsement, my brother-in-law picked up the book at my house the other day and was immediately engrossed in one of the discussions about relationships. He actually asked to borrow it, and he's not a really big book reader! Way to go Minisha! Write another book...soon!"
1,NOT Made in USA,"The clock has pieces made in CHINA, JAPAN and supposedly the US. They boldly state it is made in the USA but obviously it is not."
1,2011 Rose Bowl DVD Has Fatal Flaw,"This 2011 Rose Bowl DVD is ruinously flawed. The first quarter of the game is missing the final 3 minutes and 49 seconds and jumps to the second quarter with the score changing from 7-3 to 14-10, so the viewer completely misses one touchdown and one field goal. There is no physical damage to the disk (no scratches, abrasions or smudges), so the problem must have been human (i.e., production) error. This product should be recalled and new disks produced and distributed. What a mess."
1,Wasted money,"Poorly made, quality assuarance must be none existent; the end of the first quarter is missing an on side kick and a TCU score, other parts of the game just skip to a different quarter or another part of the game instantly with no notice. I was at this Rose Bowl and I bought this as a momento and, of course, I waited too long to watch the DVD, the return time had passed."
1,Missing game,I sat down to watch the 2011 Rose Bowl dvd that I purchased and the last 3:42 of the first quarter is missing. The dvd just stops working completely. I tried playing the disc in 2 different players thinking it might be the player but its the dvd. I have not watched any more of the game but I will assume that my dvd has the same problems the other buyers noted before my review. I would have to agree with the reviews posted before mine. I would like another disc that doesnt skip out on any of the game.
2,2011 Rose Bowl,And the reason Amazon has not contacted buyers of this dvd is.....well perhaps lazy is the reason. I inquired and got nothing back at all....Really...that hard to answer a question?
5,Good purchase,"I had no problems purchasing or receiving this book. The condition of the book was also better than originally advertised, so I felt that I got a great deal."
3,cheesy,"Let's face facts, lounge music is more fun to talk about than to listen to. Most of these tunes are background music at best. Enjoyable but nothing that is going to really rock out (that's not the point but...).For the casual music fan, the only reason really to pick this up is to see what all the fuss was about Detroit Tigers' pitching great Denny McLain and his organ playing.Other than that, it's the usual excellent packaging of cool graphics, hip and swingin' liner notes and a bunch of tunes that would fit in well at the Playboy Mansion and elevators but really irrelevant even when it comes to the farfisa organ used in the psychedelic '60s."
4,"Great set, and a minor correction to the liner notes","They have Joe Bucci listed as ""Joe Bucci Trio"", but it was actually a duo, I have the original LP (Wild About Basie!) the track ""Lil Darlin"" came from. It's Joe Bucci on organ and Joe Riddick on drums. That same LP contributed ""Topsy"" to Bachelor Pad Royale. It sounds like it's organ, string bass, and drums, but it's actually just organ and drums, Bucci had a string-bass-effect unit on his modified Hammond (assuming it's the heavily-modded BC on the cover of the album connected to a 31H Leslie.)This is one of my favorite discs, I play it quite often. Being an organ player I've long been a fan of a lot of these guys, and it was nice to see some of them get some recognition. If you like this you'll want to check out Earl Grant and Eddie Layton, too."
2,Poor quality,"After reading these amazing reviews, I purchased this phone. After all, it was inexpensive. However, I have trouble with this phone. First, I get a lot of static when walking around my house. Secondly, I have always had problems charging this phone. The connectors are bad. It may be worth the price, but I'd rather pay more for better quality."
5,IS IT A STEAL OR A DEAL??????,"These two albums on a cd...Is a killer..They are the classic finest work of Percy Sledge. No questions ask. He is Doing it the Percy Sledge way. Yes I would recommend having this cd for any couple who want to listen to a good soul artist that can really put out there, listening to the begining and to the end of this cd. It is really worth it.. ""Just out of Reach, Pledging My Love, Take Time to Know her, Drown In My Own Tears, Baby Help Me, Out of Left Field, Cover Me, It's All Wrong, But's It's Alright, Feed The Flame, You Send Me and My Special Prayer. The list goes on..."
3,was disappointed,i was surprise to see that these songs were copy from the vinyl album. i thought it be better sounding. i could have did a vinyl to cd thing with the albums myself. if you dont have the vinyl albums then i do recommend this product. the records from which the songs came from are excellent albums.
1,Horrible Sound Quality,The CD and MP3 of this sounds muffled and horrible. Don't waste your money on it. You won't want to listen to it the way it sounds.
1,Help me make it thru the night- Sammie Smith,"I hesitated buying this because of the negative reviews given its sound, however, expecting not much, I was very excited to realize that it wasn't that bad at all. It may not be a perfect sound like we are use to these days, but I was so glad to get a copy of that album, which was my very FAVORITE of Sammie's on vinyl that it did not matter all that much. Just hearing those songs again and her voice brought back some wonderful memories and feelings from that time period. Thanks to the company that made it possible!!"
1,Sammi deserves better,"The sound on this CD is absolutely wretched, the worst sounding commercial CD I ever owned. First of all, it's from a not very good vinyl copy. It's horribly off-centered in places, and very distorted in others. Secondly, the CD sounds like it was either pressed from a very low bit-rate MP3, or it was subjected to some severe noise reduction. Whatever the case, the sound is all muffled and swishy. My scratchy vinyl copy sounds much better than this.Sammi Smith was a wonderful singer with a beautiful, soulful voice. Her first album ranks among my all-time favorites by anyone. Varese managed to put out a nice sounding compiliation, (from real tapes, it sounds like). I can't understand why her first album doesn't get the same treatment. Instead, we have this abomination.She deserves much better than this.5 stars for the music, 0 stars for the sound."
2,great selection of songs but,"I was excited to see the list of songs on this CD. I love Sammi Smith's music, used to own two of her LP's. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the sound reproduction when I received the CD."
1,"Zolar: Hilarious to Laugh at, Terrible movie","Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a running joke in my family. The graphics are far behind the times, and half the story plot doesn't make sense. It's a made-for tv movie, so I didn't expect much out of it, but it's pretty funny to laugh at."
5,RAY DAVIES IS THE GODFATHER OF (BRITISH) POP MUSIC!!!,"C'mon Now Critics! Get off the that 'pompus pillar' you sit you 'lily-white butts' upon. The KINKS music will still be enjoyed by their fans long after your last review of 'Hootie' or 'Pearl Jam' has long been forgotten. And tell, oh wise critics, Why do Hootie, Pearl Jam, etc., still pay homage to Raymond Douglas Davies and company in their shows? Why? Because The KINKS are GREAT!!!!Oh sure, the KINKS have made some un-interesting music but, for every 'klinker' (or, ""Kink-er""), there are ten other tunes that will take that place..Want something to 'kick' other than the KINKS? Try any number of these 'one-shot-wonders' that will be forgotten after their first number one...Hell, even Van Halen still plays ""YOU REALLY GOT ME"" in concert..."
5,An edgy read,"I love reading books like this because they make me think I'm part of some cool, hip crowd that ""gets"" these books. Fried writes in minimalist terms, yet that doesn't keep both the story and characters from having a whallop of an impact. I found myself thinking about Alice for weeks after I'd finished the book--replaying some of the scenes and dialogue in my mind. ""Nellcott is My Darling"" is up for a major book award in Canada and after reading it, it's easy to see why. This is a gifted author and I look forward to reading her next novel."
5,Chi Town's Best,"Qwel's rhymes are some of the best out there not only because he flows so well, but because of the content in his words which often make you think. From the evils of abortion, to religion, to a love song, this album has it all. The beats are great too, as they complement his flows immaculately. Robust gives great verses on $...AD and Art of War. Look for his album as well. This buy is definitely worth it and also check out his new album(Rubber Duckie Experiment), the Typical Cats cd, Qwazaar's Walk through Walls, anything from Galapagos 4, and definitely Atmosphere's Overcast and Lucy Ford. Go to hiphopinfinity.com to see what's up in real hip hop. If you like Missy Elliot and Nelly, don't buy this because you obviously don't know good hip hop. Sit back, chill and listen to this all the way through, then again and again."
4,Babes in dreamland,"Royo is, more than anything else, a pinup artist. His best and best-known work features gorgeous models in varying degrees of removal from exotic costumes and lingerie. Plenty of that work appears here, in settings drawn from adventure and romance, SF and fantasy, and a range of other genres. Male figures are well done, of course, but lack the passion of his illustrations of female figures.Beyond his wonderful finished work, Royo also presents some of his preliminary sketches, drawings, and sequences showing the development of a single image. The text describes his materials if not his whole process, and I found it surprising - pencil sketches, development in arcylic and tempera, and finishes in oil. I found the text weak, seeming to wander in and out of metaphors mixed unsuccessfully. No matter, I wasn't here for the text. Royo is about his imagery, and this collection presents a spectacular range of it.//wiredweird"
5,Dreams,This is an amazing book. The pic's in it are done very well and I'm happy to have it in my colection.
1,THE WORST COMPUTER I HAVE EVER OWNED.,"I have had this computer for 7 weeks, and I've had nothing but problems. I bought it new from Best Buy and because it's past their 14 day return policy, the only thing they will do is take a look at it, IF I BUY their extended warranty.I have been on the phone NUMEROUS times (to a 605 Utah phone number, NOT an 800#) with GATEWAY. Twice within 24 hrs. they told me to run the restore DVD.Do you really think that a new computer should LOCK up EVERYDAY upon booting up????I've asked for a replacement, and Gateway said that I could ship back the computer, and they would fix it.OKAY....What do I do in the meantime for a computer that I need for my work???? Is this a bad joke??It is now Feb. 2009, and I still have this computer. I had to replace every component in it. Note: I had to do the replacing. Fateway sent me the parts, and I was the one that had to become a technician."
2,A Tribute to Operation Ivy,"I've been a Operation Ivy for a while now and I've gotten all of their albums, and when this one came I didn't know what to expect. A very unusual item, but the music isn't very good. I wouldn't spend more than 10$ on it. I would only recomend it for an intense operation Ivy fan who just wants it as a collectable."
1,Don't waste your money....,"This game is about as much fun as getting your teeth drilled. The action is very choppy and you cannot keep your ""Girl"" on the ground. Also this game claims to have vibration function, which it does not. The only reason it gets one star is because I cannot go any lower according to this rating system. ... my money has just gone down the toilet never to be seen again. ..."
1,TERRIBLE!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,First of all i did not buy this on amazon. The price was to high for a kids game. I just wanted because i like the powerpuff girls. Now i am glad i did not buy it on amazon. I saw it for $5 at gamestop. Now i know why it was only $5 it was one of the worst games i ever played! The gameplay was stupidly hard for a kids game. the controls were terrible. There is an arrow that is supposed to direct you where you are going but it always points you to the wrong direction. The worst part is that it is very repetitive and super annoying. Don't buy this game even if your a fan of the powerpuff girls. Don't even buy it for your kids because they will also get frustrated. I would have gave it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me. I hope this review was helpful!
2,Not good,"My daughter loves the powerpuff girls. She has the dolls, all the seasons on DVD but no matter how much she tried she could not get into the game. Avoid!"
4,Lengthy and Sometimes Boring,"I found Stanley Weintraub's book The Last Great Victory to be boring. I usually enjoy books regarding World War II, but this was one to suffer through. The book covers all of the final preparations towards the end of the war. I guess someone who enjoys reading about all the planning towards the end of World War II would like this book.Some people have said that The Last Great Victory is comparable to Steven Ambrose and other famous historical writers. I disagree in the sense that Ambrose manages to keep the readers attention, while Weintraub's book seems to include more detail than interesting trivia.Overall, I would recommend this book if you are interested in the preparations at the end of World War II or in politics of the 1940's, but other than that, skip this and pick up one of Steven Ambroses' books instead."
5,"Outstanding work in tradition of Ambrose, Catton and Ryan","""The Last Great Victory"" is an outstanding achievement. It is written in the great narrative style of Steven Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan, and Bruce Catton. The reader is transported to the pathos of the Summer of 1945. It is a work that has deserved greater attention. Outstanding, vigorous scholarship, coupled with a poignancy and urgency that can create a visceral response on the part of the reader (especially in the Hiroshima narratives), it deals honestly with the likes of Stalin, Molotov, Churchill, Truman, and Hirohito. The only limitation is that the Pottsdam material is at times a bit tedious---however it is an important inclusion if one is to understand some of the policy issues behind the denouement of the war, as well as the policy issues that framed the Cold War. Once beyond Pottsdam, however, the book soars as a tragic poem about both the frailties as well as the aspirations of the human experience. Kudos, kudos, and more kudos!!!"
3,Disapponted,The pillows were much smaller than I expected and 2 were torn and the seam. The colors were not as vivid as the picture.
3,Mediocre Mix of Miscellaneous Music,"This CD in the ULTRA-LOUNGE series can be considered as a weak sister to Vol.18, which it most nearly resembles. There are some pretty good toe-tappin tunes, some so-so ones, and some dismissable ones. However, any album that contains ""Bingo Bango Bongo"" can't be all bad. Plus, you get another installment, via the hidden bonus track, of the continental ""Mr. Smoothee."""
4,Cheese-fest,This is one of the cheesiest CDs around! It has a funky blend of music that is ideal if you believe you are Hugh Hefner and living in the 1950's and 1960's. Put on your smoking jacket and break out the cognac and cigars!
3,How can you cut Evanovich's words?,"This series is toooooo good to cut a single word. I adore the analogies, characters, and descriptions in these books - I was sorely dissapointed to find these audio versions abridged.DO THEM OVER UNABRIDGED and I will purchase every single audio and enjoy what I've already read and fell in love with.Who makes these decisions and what in the world were they thinking????"
1,BEWARE!!!!!,This game came with spyware that shut my computer down!!! The disk was a copy and did not work! it cost me money to fix my computer! do not buy this game from this company!
2,Slow moving,I was playing all the free downloads of various Risk games I could find and finally broke down and bought this. I was disappointed - it moved very slowly compared to some of the online games I had tried. I played a few games against the computer and then used it to play thru an online server - which took forever to set up and then kept crashing during play. Glad I didn't buy it new.
4,Risk II,"Bought this for my son who is 16. It is one of three we purchased. Games arrived promptly, in great condition. He loved the board game, so we decided to try it. Success!"
5,I'm still using it and it's been good to us!,"You don't know what you have until you buy a different piece of crap highchair! I bought this Evenflo when I had my 1st boy. I'm still using it and it has been GREAT! BUT, I made the mistake of buying a Graco one with a non-removable tray and I count my blessings that I bought this Evenflo. I love it and have been using it for almost 3 yrs. and will keep using it until it falls apart!"
5,Everything adjusts on this chair!,"With 7 height adjustments and 3 recline seat positions, this highchair adapts to any table height and child size. We have a taller (bar-stool height) dining table and the tallest adjustment keeps our daughter at table level (she loves to be included at mealtime!). The tray slides in far enough to secure even a small baby. We have been putting our daughter in it since 5 months. She can't reach the toy yet, but it pops in and out of the tray easily for play. It rolls easily from kitchen to dining area, and has 2 bars on the back to hang the tray and any bibs or towels, when not in use. It took my husband about 30 minutes to assemble and was not difficult. We are very pleased and satisfied with this chair."
2,slouchy seat,"We were initally pleased with this chair, however as time went on the seat began to sag back. Our son, now 18 months old, has to pull himself forward just to eat. The joints between the front and rear legs have separated and we're now researching new high chairs since we're concerned about the possiblity of the joint failing completely."
1,DO NOT BUY EVENFLO HIGH CHAIRS!!,"I have now owned 2 Evenflo high chairs, and both have resulted in injury to my children!The first was the Evenflo Envision chair, and my son got his arm caught between the A frame support and the body of the chair itself. The space between the supports and the chair was too wide!! His elbow was nearly dislocated when we removed it!!We contacted Evenflo, who gave us the NEW version of the chair, which had a much smaller space between the two. We thought this would solve the problem, and since we loved the chair otherwise, were happy.NOW, my daughter, who is 6 months, got her fingers pinched in the holes at the back of the legs that allow for the height adjustment feature. The skin was shredded clean off her tiny fingers. We will NEVER buy an Evenflo chair again, as ALL EVENFLO HIGH CHAIRS HAVE THIS DESIGN, including the MAJESTIC, ENVSION, and EXPRESSIONS!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Chair Is Horrible,"It's been three hours, I'm sweaty and it STILL isn't put together. The directions are terrible and I should have heeded the reviews. Evenflo Expressions was the only one at the store that was displayed and I wanted to make sure I got a chair where the tray comes all the way off so I can get my kid in and out (she's 18 months). This chair is a nightmare. I HATE IT. If I can figure out how to disassemble the thing, I'm TAKING IT BACK. I wish I had never bought it. I'm going back to Graco. This was my first (and only now) Evenflo product. Never again."
1,Fabric is not machine washable,"I got the high chair new few months back (May 2008) and once while eating, my kid puked on the chair. So i decided to give the cover a wash in washing machine to clean. The fabric completely worn out on single wash. Customer service says, it's not machine washable!!How can high chair fabric be NOT WASHABLE meant for infants and kids???I would NOT Recommend this."
4,An Audio Adaption that Goes Beyond The Film.,"An excellent adaption of the classic John Landis film, well converted to audio.In stereo the Radio play is creepy as the film ever was.With much of the original cast reprising there on screen roles we get a level of experience from a production team with a rep for hamming up performances. Many of the actors reprising roles come from a Shakespeare background and many are the gems of British television.The exception being the use of radio actors as the 2 lead roles.They are a perfect example of hammy.Taking the story past the movie and even incorporating a pre movie scene with an escaped lunatic on the moors will give fans of the film a treat, while the original story is as riveting as ever right up to it's tragic and moving ending.Director Dirk Maggs can be proud of this."
5,This book has great software.,"The cd-rom software that comes with this book is great. The software is mulit-media and guides the user along, literally, through a series of lessons that give a solid foundation in Word 97. I used the book-software to help me earn my Microsoft Office User Specialist, Word 97 certificate. I've recomended the book to several others, and I am glad to give the book praise here too."
1,Player is too sensitive to motion,"I bought it for my 2-yr. old granddaughter, but the player skips when she tries to carry it around. It isn't practical and not a ""travel cassette player"", as advertised."
2,Fun but not great.,"The cassette player is fun--all of our little guests want to play with it when they come over. However, the headphones are too big for a two or three year olds head and always fall off. We've been as careful as we can with a toddler, but our tape player likes to eat tapes now and sometimes the sound quality is funny."
1,do not buy,This product is horrible!!!!! I had to send the first one back because it broke the second day that my child had it. It took several weeks for us to get the new one and when it finally did come it broke after three days of use.
3,"Unusual book, but it ended wonderfully.","Rosalind Carmichael being the devoted sister to her get in trouble brother Tony has to borrow money from someone she hates the most. Sam Winter has always had feeling for Rosalind, and is determined to get her to be a permanent part of his life. Rosalind puts her engagment to her stuffy fiance to the test by agreeing to ""live"" with Sam to repay a debt. What she does not count on is seeing Sam for the truly loving, generous man who is actually better for her. The question is will she make the right choice or will Sam lose her forever? Good read."
3,Twelve good to outstanding solos by George Guesnon,"Twelve Solos by George Guesnon. I especially liked ""Sunflower County Blues"" and ""Gossip Mongin' Woman"" - two original compositions.The 12 solos are followed bya) 5 #'s by a trio (Kid Thomas & Israel Gorman).b) a duet with Emanual Paulc) a trio with Kid Howard & Lewis Jamesd) two duets with Kid SheikThese last 9 numbers are of poor quality and flagged as ""Previously unissued"". If you're interested in George Guesnon or basic blues banjo & guitar this is good stuff. But if you stumbled across this while doing a search on any of the other artists mentioned above, keep searching.JDB 9/14/98"
1,Beware the Limits,"of this program. It will not work with 64-bit computers and the CD has to be physically in the computer while it's being utilized. All type must be on the same line, so for more than a very short phrase, the ""size"" is limited. That said: for a headline or simple insert or sub-head, there are some interesting styles of text."
3,Not what I expected,"Maybe I didn't understand the product description, but it was not very useful to me. I was expecting lots of fonts... Maybe for kids and teens it has better use."
4,"Not Their Best, But Still Great","Nico is a great album. Don't let the title mislead you. It's just that their self-titled album and Soup are so good that Nico can't compare. The Pusher is great cover of the original. The Ripped Away Version of No Rain is really neat to here, it's a nice rendition of the song that never gets old. Soul One is my favorite song on the CD. Those are just my highlights though. If you loved the other two CDs of theirs then you'll love this. Now, what is this new Classic Masters CD?"
5,The real deal,First of Nico is the name of his daughter(Nico Blue Hoon)and although Shannon did overdose it was cocaine not heroin....just buy the damn album..its well worth it.
5,One of the best albums ever!,"I was shocked the first time I heard this album, because every song sounded amazing, even on the first listening. One of my favorite albums of all time and even after having it for a long time, I still listen to it constantly. A must have for any serious music fan."
5,"If you know what Hoon really likes, you'll dig it.","Buy it, there are a number of great songs on it. Also its got the bee song the way Hoon really wanted it played. dig it"
4,Luxemburg Adventurer/observer,"For folks interested in this relatively unexplored portion of Central American, this account is a thorough examination of the flora, fauna, peoples and customs of the region. I'm still curious about his straighforward description of the legendary ""chupacabra""."
1,Is this guy Nuts,"This monitor sells for $669 direct from dell, are you retarded asking for 2000 ...."
3,"Great monitor, horrible DELL customer service","This monitor is beautiful, had a small issue that could have been cleared up by a normal CS agent, instead turned into a 3 week fiasco, DELL customer service is HORRIBLE, I will never purchase another product from them again, EVER! I've dealt with poor customer svc, but they take it to a whole new level, great work DELL :("
2,No response to product exchange,I have received a different Harley Davidson from the seller and there has been no response to compensate my claim as i paid extra forwarding cost from US to Malaysia.Thanks but no thanks
3,Apolitical Imagery,"The Photographs, beautifully printed, are solidly in the tradition of Ansel Adams.Whether you want to call them derivative or not depends on your point of view but to criticize them for not being political, as a previous reviewer has done, displays a peculiarly 20th century myopia - as though meaning can only be only be found through dialectic.As for your suggestions about what would be more contemporary, lets see how dated they are:Alban Berg - born in the 19th century.Modernism - early 20th century movementIn your view abstract painting would be dead as well, or are your sophomoric opinions reserved exclusively for photography? Why not leave your tired categories and your worn copy of Das Kapital behind and join us in the 21st century for a genuine dialogue. Otherwise I'm afraid I'll have to dismiss you as a critic and as a thinker."
4,A splendid discovery,"We have just discovered Capt. John Handy and have been tracking down his recordings. These are his first. It's quite a mix of songs, with blues, hymns, and boogie woogie. My only objection is the inclusion of two versions of The Old Rugged Cross, which I find one of the dreariest of the old hymns. However, I realize that many people love it and so will be delighted to have it on here twice."
4,Great space saver!,"I'm able to stack 4 ice cube trays on it! It's provided me with so much more space and organization, in my freezer. It's a great product=)"
3,ok,"A bit wider then normal ice cube trays, so you kinda have to set it just right so it doesn't tilt in."
3,OK,It is just okay since I guess my ice trays are smaller that the ones that are recommended for use.
2,Cheaply made product,Cheaply made. wouldn't lay flat on shelf. Had to bend metal to improve the way it sat on shelf. Definitely overpriced.
1,Handbook of Practical Electrical Design,"The McGraw-Hill cover misrepresents this book. It may preach to the choir but makes no converts. Concepts are long, obscure or ignored. The print is tight and some tables are not legible in places. The reader will learn little. Pedagogy is not the authors' strength. Having learned the basics of electricity in school I hoped for some of what the publisher promises, but was very dissappointed and 60 bucks poorer. Avoid my mistake."
2,Old outdated,I haven't spent too much time in the book. The 2 times I referenced it I was not impressed. I think it is geared more towards a beginner Engineer that has little knowledge of electrical systems and more of a colligate background dealing with electrical theory.The book seemed old and outdated. You would be better off with just a NEC Hankbook.
5,The man knows whereof he speaks,"What impressed me most about this book is how directly useful and applicable it is, and not just for people who have bags and bags of money. Clearly, Mr. Maurer has a lifetime of experience working with very rich people and families whose affairs are very complex. But, if you have any significant property of any kind, the odds are that you fall into the same basket as many others--paying insufficient attention to making sure it works for you and that it gets into the hands you want (e.g., family and friends) rather than the hands you don't want (e.g., Uncle Sam and probate attorneys). This book feels like it's written by an expert, but written for everyone in this situation. I think it's first rate."
2,Not the Millionaire Next Door,The jacket and synopsis of this book read like it may have similar content to The Millionaire Next Door. The content is primarily fundamental personal financial planning information. The continual commercials for U.S. Trust and a cameo Schwab reference were a bit distracting.
4,wedding gift,"I am purchasing this product today. After comparing it with the 13 piece set, I feel the quality of this one is better, as the steel is forged. I hope the bride and groom enjoy it. If they do, I will be purchasing this set for myself."
5,"A charming, unconventional, mature love story","In Sprig Muslin, Georgette Heyer stands romantic convention on its ear. The true heroine of the piece is NOT the beautiful, tempestuous young ingenue, but instead a shy, quiet ""spinster"" whose humor and courage gradually emerge as the ingenious plot unfolds. Sprig Muslin was not one of my favorite Heyer novels the first time I read it, but I have come to treasure it more with each reading."
3,I LOVE Heyer... this isn't one of my favorites,"All Geoergette Heyer books are fun. This one just isn't a favorite because it focuses so heavily upon a secondary character, Amanda, who is profoundly annoying!!!!Sir Gareth is a lovely hero, and Hester is interesting, too. Unfortunately only very few pages develop their romance. What a wasted opportunity! It's really too bad the development of their relationship is so thin and brief.If you love Heyer you'll enjoy this book, it just isn't one of her best. If you are looking for the very best Heyer, I'd recommend Friday's Child."
3,A rather dull Heyer,"The problem with this book for me was lack of interest in the characters. Amanda just grated on my nerves. The hero seemed to have no humor, nor did the heroine, who barely appears in the book. There are so many better Heyers."
4,One of my Top 4 Heyer Favorites,"I love Heyer best in full farcical mode--as she is in this book! It is true Amanda can be a bit annoying, but since she is, after all, just the Means by which Heyer contrived to get her hero and heroine together (since, left to their own devices, they are driftingly gently but inexorably apart), I do not mind her. As a heroine, she would have been tiresome: as a catalyst, she's amusing!"
3,Spring Muslin,"This book might be a good introduction to Regency life for a younger reader, but for an adult it is fairly predictable. Heyer's descriptive writing is always entertaining and certainly gives her readers excellent images. The characters are very one-dimensionable to the point of being ridciulous in the case of those who are more youthful in the plot. HEyer has written other books that have a much more interesting plot."
3,Wanted to like it,"Being a short, unfashionable myopic woman, I really wanted to love this book. I think I have read all of Heyer's works that are currently available in print, and this is one of my least favorites For reference, others in the least favorite Heyer category include ""The Foundling"", ""Charity Girl"", ""The Convenient Marriage"", ""Friday's Child"" and a few of the mysteries.Like at least one of the other reviewers, I wanted to smack pretty Amanda right in the mouth (or at least gag and bind her). I never warmed to Sir Gareth's love interest in this book, though I really wanted to. The escapades in general seemed forced.Why would I give it 3 stars, then, you ask? Well, that's because an un-favorite Heyer is still a well-written book that gives a view into a specific time period with witty language. That and the end scene made me give it 3 stars instead of 2."
3,Not one of Heyer's best.,"I love Georgette Heyer's books. Hers were among the first ""grown up"" books I read as a junior high school kid 20 years ago, and I can't begin to count the number of times I've reread my favorites. This one disappointed. By the end of the book, I, like Sir Gareth Ludlow's relatives, wondered what he sees in Ms. Theale. The chemistry between the protagonists just isn't there."
2,not my one of my favorites,"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was just not one of her better stories."
2,Completely at a loss...,"I am utterly astonished at the number of five star reviews being given to a book so poorly written. The 'anti-hero' characters argue like bickering children and often commit actions that contradict previously established character traits. Each chapter begins with an index entry to describe a character, the ultimate betrayal of the 'show, don't tell' golden rule held by good authors everywhere. The dialogue is full of illogical lines, my favourite example to pick on being ""This doesn't mean we have a common cause, it just means we all want the wizard dead."" One of the greatest qualities of fantasy fiction - that it offers you an escape to a world where heroes still exist - is sadly betrayed when none of the characters are particularly admirable. This isn't a fantasy novel, it's a circus."
4,Amazing debut...,"The first half of this album is perfect. It is extremely beautiful music. My personal favorite song is ""Master of None"". I have been listening to this album over and over again for a week now. It just puts me in such a happy place. I can't describe how beautiful this music is...just buy it and find out for yourself...you won't regret it.I can't wait to see what else they put out in the future."
5,One of my favorite albums,"BH has replaced Opal and Kendra Smith as my go-to sublime band. I never thought I'd find music as beautiful as Opal's ""Early Recordings"". Also way better than Mazzy Star or the over-rated Hope Sandoval."
3,Beach House debut,"Often cited as the promise of Mazzy Star fulfilled, Beach House comes along in the time of Grizzly Bear. Yet in the hands of a realized band, tracks like Apple Orchard and Master of None could've gone all the way, but here the lack of presence and control lets these tracks flutter off into a novelty of ""not so much"". This album shows more promise for the band's future which became much more evident in the 4 star album Devotion."
4,Great on occasion,"(3.5/5 stars) The range of music on here varies from outstanding (the title track, sung by Dean Martin) to the ridiculous (""Choo Choo Cha Cha"" and ""Rock cha Rhumba""). I'm not really certain what the purpose of putting two versions of ""Sway"" on here is, though one would have sufficed. The dance lesson at the end of the CD really seems to be filler material, though it does keep in line with the series. Regardless, there are numerous songs to make this entry in the series worthwhile. ""You're My Thrill"" and ""Whatever Lola Wants"" are two of the best, while ""Gopher Mambo"" is a familiar tune I did not previously have in my collection. This would be great to play at a party or while cooking, but it is not something to listen to very often. Don't rush out to buy this, but if you happen to have money burning a hole in your pocket..."
3,more details and information,"The information in this rug is not completed. It is not indicated that if it is hand made or machine made. it did not indicated which city and what is the name of design and the qualities of treat. Is it wood, silk or what?"
5,Great little oven,"I purchased this because I live alone, and using a full-sized oven to bake one cod filet seemed wasteful. This is a great oven. The toast is done to perfection, the convection baked a casserole for me in a half hour, and I broiled a steak that was done just right. Grilled steaks are frequently on the dry side, with charred edges. With the broiler, the meat was tender, juicy, and easy to cut. I have retired my old toaster, and this appliance takes up very little more room. It is easy to clean, handsomely designed, and the controls are easy to manipulate. If it broke, I would have to get another one just like it. However, it shows no sign of weakness anywhere, and I expect to use it for many years."
1,"Lousy the first time, lousy the second time.","The Krups FBC4 is a really beautiful toaster oven that is very elegant on any counter. But that means squat if it doesn't work. In December of 2005, I purchased my first FBC4 and it promptly stopped working entirely after 3 days. I returned it to Williams-Sonoma and exchanged it for another one. Now it is January 2007, just 14 months after it came into my home. Once again, it has stopped working entirely. Since I've had it 14 months, the warranty has expired (warranty is only 12 months). Last night I smelled some faint burning plastic when toasting, and I can only assume that the heating element blew. $200 is far too expensive for a toaster that has only 1 year of life in it. I will never buy a Krups toaster again. P.S. I'm also having all sorts of trouble with my Krups coffeemaker."
5,convection oven digital toaster,"The product arrived promptly. It is more complicated that most toaster ovens. I bought it because I wanted my toast to be evenly toasted on top and bottom, which this toaster does very well.I have cooked frozen potato wedges and fries, using the convection setting, and they came out nicely browned and crispy.Overall, once you figure out how to use the settings, this toaster oven is a winner."
4,so glad I purchased this,"I purchased this oven about 1 1/2 months ago and I love it so far. After reading many, many reviews about all different toaster ovens, I chose to purchase this one. I agree with a lot of the other reviews on the positives, it cooks fast, easy to use, is roomy. The only negative I see so far is you do have to be careful when you remove things because the trays slide out because there is no mechanism to stop them. That is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. I don't see this as that big of a deal though, I am just careful when I take things out. I also love the look of the oven."
1,Door won't stay closed!,The latch on the door failed after a few years. Perfectly good toaster oven gone to heck :-(Too expensive to try to fix. Out of warranty & Krups doesn't care.
1,FIRE HAZZARD,Unit turns on by itself. Caused damage to my kitchen after it turned on one night on its own. DO NOT PURCHASE!
2,timer didn't work,"My timer button was slightly depressed right from the beginning. But, right after the warranty expired, it stopped working completely. A lot of money for an oven that lasted a little more than a year. I will replace it with anything but Krups. I did like it until it died prematurely, though. My previous DeLonghi toaster oven was still working after more than 14 years when I replaced it for something more current."
2,Died after 2.5 years -- no deal.,"Toaster worked fine for 30-months and then just konked out. Seems like an electrical problem but regardless, Krups has no interest in the problem or the solution. For $250, I expect better performance and MUCH Better customer service"
4,Glad I bought it.,"Obviously a high quality and attractive appliance. The quartz elements seem to heat almost instantly and evenly. The digital controls are very easy to use, with an illuminated display. The oven is simple to clean, with a pull-out crumb tray. An audible beep signals that cooking time is done. However the rear panel gets so hot that I pull it out from the wall several inches to protect the wallpaper. The soft rubber ""feet"" sometimes come out of their sockets when lifting the oven. (my counters are clean) The pre-programmed toast setting is 4, but must be raised to 6 in order to toast properly. It toasts very well, but takes approx. 4 minutes to do the job because of large size of the oven. Being large though, it will cook items that wouldn't fit in a lesser oven. Made in China, but well built."
4,Krup Toaster Oven,Over all I like this toster works great. What I don't like is the non stick tray that came with this unit. The first time I used it the teflon coating came off. I am going to call and see if they have a replacement. Other wise I think it is a great unit. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the poor quality of the trays.
1,TWO defective units sent back!,"The first unit I received wouldn't turn off. I returned it and the second unit I received wouldn't turn off either. I had to unplug them to get them to turn off. I returned them both and bought a Cuisinart brand toaster oven instead. It's too bad because I liked the features of this Krups unit, but I wasn't going to take a third chance with them."
4,Great oven (after warranty repair),"Even though this was the first toaster oven we bought, we decided to spend rather more money and buy a quality item. The oven warms up very fast, seems to hold the temperature steady and bakes evenly (altough the body gets quite hot). It also looks nice and would not hesitate to give it 5 stars, if it wasn't for the same problem a previous reviewer experienced - the paint on the door melted and it was almost impossible to open the door. We tried to use it for some period, hoping the paint would stabilize and harden, but finally called Krups customer service. They suggested to send it to their repair center, where they replaced the door and frame. The paint on the replacement parts seems to have higher melting point. The door no longer gets stuck to the body even at the highest temperature setting."
1,arrived DOA,"Looked foward to trying out my new oven. 5 minutes after first test, the upper elements failed to come on. Very dissapointed to say the least. Krups needs better QC on thier products. I did order another one and will let you know what happens."
1,non functional - item returned,The handle on the item was broke almost off and the appliance did not function at all when plugged in. (Was purchased from the warehouse option)
4,Krups toaster oven,"This is a good looking toaster oven and appears to be well built, I expect it to last for a long time unlike the de Longhi I previously used. I have not used it for baking yet, but I expect it will do ok. It toasts fine albeit a bit slowly.I would recommend this appliance."
2,Repair service is slow,"Mine broke after 9 months. I took it in to a service center and they're trying to repair it (instead of just giving me a new one like I'd have expected). It's been a month and they're still waiting on a part with no ETA. At this rate, I'll miss both Thanksgiving and Christmas.Sigh.When it was working, I'd give it 3.5 stars. It's not really an oven replacement because the top element is too close so it burns things, and the dial for presets is worthless, but it's a pretty good toaster oven."
2,Waste Of Money,"This worked great for about 8 months, then the digital started going all screwy. The toaster won't come on, the oven won't shut off. Didn't come with any instructions on altering recipes using the convection baking. Now I need a new one, and don't feel like spending more money on top of the $150 I spent on it new. Really disappointed. I thought since it was Krups, it would be quality. Guess I was wrong."
1,"Old, expired film sold as New!","The film that I was sent (Dec 2010) had expired more than 3 years ago (2007). There was no indication on the ad on Amazon.com that the consumer would be purchasing expired film. Why sell old, expired film and not state such so that people don't waste their time and money?"
1,Do not buy film from this seller (uBuyWeRush)!,This seller (uBuyWeRush) just sold me film that expired THREE (3) YEARS AGO!It has already expired! Don't waste your time! Go elsewhere for your film needs!
2,Don't trust this game!,This is just another F1 racing !!! so boring ! the graphics are OK but I can't find a hard solid details in this game. The only 1 good point is that you can race in some cities but still not so impreesive. If you want F1 racing buy EA SPORT F1 2001-2.
1,dont bother,i found this game dull and boring the whole game layout was not worth my money racing is fun but unrelistic crashes.the open wheel cars on the game are way different from the movie bly and tanto go by team spirt (korny) simulation is bad. if was do do it all over agin i would go with cart fury or f1 2002as i said dont bother
1,Inappropriate Cover Art,"Although I'm sure Sly Stalone is too busy thinking about where his career went wrong, the PR people who designed the cover art for ""Driven"" should have realized the inappropriate juxtaposition of the twin towers with the exploding race car. As far as I'm concerned, this game and it's offensive cover should be pulled from the shelves."
3,Not a bad unit for the money,"I picked one of these up for my bedroom. The installation instructions are hard to follow. I got it setup, and it does what it was designed to do -- it cools my bedroom quite nicely. It is not quiet, however. I wouldn't say it's obnoxiously loud, either -- but it is loud enough to be worth mentioning. The noise factor is the only thing I don't like about this unit. That said, it's nothing I wouldn't expect from an $80 air conditioner.I would give this 5 stars if it were quiet.Bottom line: I'd rather sleep with ear plugs and be cool, than have my bedroom be 90 degrees and quiet.UPDATE:I've had this thing for over a year now. It's LOUD LOUD LOUD. I can't even sleep in the same room as it with earplugs. It sounds like the fan blades are spinning in a pool of water. I ended up drilling some holes in the front of it where the water collects so it can run out into a bucket... but really, this unit is garbage. I take back my original 3 star review... 1 star all the way"
1,definately not a quiet air conditioner,"We recently purchased 2 of these bedroom air conditioners and were quite happy with the price. We installed them, started them up and within 3 hours one of the 2 was making quite a bit of noise and not just normal air-conditioning noises one would expect to hear. It sounded like there was something INSIDE the air conditioner itself, being batted around inside. It was so obnoxious I couldn't sleep with it running.And now a day later, the other air conditioner (same make/model) is doing the EXACT same thing.It is totally frustrating to spend money on something that is junk. Yes, it does cool our rooms slightly, but the annoyance of the rattling noise inside the unit isn't worth the aggravation.I wouldn't waste my money on a Haier product in the future."
3,A/C unit,"The A/C works very well. Not too noisy,runs very smooth. It cools the room i have it in well. The delivery time was faster than what they had stated. all in all the whole transaction went well."
1,"Super loud, doesn't cool well","As soon as we installed this unit and started it up it made so, so much noise. It makes the usual air conditioner compressor/fan noise of course but also a noise like a bug zapper, a loud crackling buzzing sound which is really irritating. If that noise gets quieter on and off there is a creaking sound and a sound like the compressor or fan motor is really struggling whenever it is set on ""low"". It makes so much noise we can't even hear each other talking in the same room. I understand air conditioners are not silent devices but I have had air conditioners twice the BTU of this one that were much, much quieter. Worse yet even when turned up to the top of its cooling range it doesn't manage to cool a tiny room very well. A really poor product, even though we found it on clearance I still feel the price was to high for this unit."
3,First Love,I've heard all the songs. As you listen to her sing you pick up familiar sounding voice & Dolly Parton comes to mind. For me the best of the entire album is Strawberry Wine. This song really takes you back to your middle to late teenage years & your first love. I give the entire album 3 stars but Strawberry Wine 5 stars
3,The British release was better!,"This Capitol release is quite good, but in fact she released a far superior cd in the UK about a year and a half earlier for Patriot (1995), with about seven tracks(all excellent) which aren't on this. The only omission from that disc was Strawberry Wine, so completists have to have both! It really is the most perfect female-singer country recording I have ever heard, giving her marvellously expressive voice lots of room to soar, especially on I Can't Shake You ."
2,Not Great,"This phone picks up microwave frequencies. I thought 2.4 GHZ were not suppose to do this. Also, I will charge the battery overnight, and then when I'm on a call, I get that darn beeping sound alerting me my battery is about to die. This is a brand new battery. It shouldn't do this. I finally bought another phone which I love! I got the Panasonic KX-TG2352W and so far it is the best cordless I have ever owened. I will never go back to cheap phones."
5,fantastick phone,Great reception (beetter than our GE with the answering machine and caller ID that costs twice as much).Doesn't take up much space.Highly recommended
5,Amazing.,This book is such a tremendous resource for ANYONE who wants to grow in their understanding and practice of Biblical prayer. I think that ANY Christian who reads this book can benefit greatly from its contents. I highly recommend it.
5,this is the kind of book everybody loves,"This story is very cute, my children also have cranky days and they see themselves as a main character of the book. The illustrations are beautiful. The quality of the paper and cover is perfect. I enjoy reading it at bedtime may be even more than the kids do :) I will look for any other books by this author and illustrator."
5,Great Read for a Cranky Day,We all have cranky days. This book affirms things will improve. Share this book with the little and big people in your life. The book will generate laughter and improve the day.
3,Good for beginner,"This is a pretty good book for the beginner. You need to be able to read Bengali already. It helped me along. The pictures are helpful. It might not be for the more advanced learner, but it's not bad. It's a pretty good stop along the way, in my opnion."
3,Good starter,Sturdy book. Colourful pictures. Simple everyday words to start off with. A good place to begin.
1,Ceramic Tile Adhesive,"I used this product to put down a tile floor in our kitchen, turned out to be a disaster. This product has a very long drying time. If you want to grout in a couple of days don't use this adhesive. A week and a half later we had tiles coming loose because the adhesive was still not dry. Entire floor will need to be torn up and redone.I would never use this product in the future."
2,Not what I expected,"The item in picture looks really elegant...when I received it, I found it was plastic, not fabric and bright colors not pale as in the picture."
4,Truth Hurts Mc Gruder is an execllent satrist,"I love the Boondocks comic strip because it does something most people are afraid to do in ""Bushworld"" It speaks truth to power. It is a compliation of the first 4 years of Boondocks strips starting with a world full of characters like Tom and Susan Dubois, Jazmine,and Star Wars guy to the post 9-11 phony patriotism that evolved from the attacks. My favorite is flagge and ribbon and the absurdity of our Patriotism with the media marketing everything. With a great forward from Micheal Moore Aaron Mcgruder's strip told more truth in three panels and provides a loyal oppostion to what passes for news these days. I am looking foward to seeing his show on Adult Swim this fall. buy the book you (and your children) will not be disapointed."
4,recognize.,"The Boondocks is about the funniest, most interesting, most intelligent, and really the only vital comic strip out there today. Aaron Macgruder is consistently on point at all times. The fact that this comic still publishes daily in mainstream newspapers country wide is an irony not lost on this reviewer. i couldn't recommend this (and all subsequent following) collections more highly. it is a wonder."
2,"Funny sometimes, but...","Yeah, sure, some of it makes for good satire, but let's face it. This comic book is just plain one-sided and angry and hardly has an ounce of redeeming value. This is all I got: Good African American equals Leftist African American. McGruder wanted us to think with boondocks, but all I got was anger coming from the pages... that's all. Sorry, but it's too narrow minded for my taste. And yes, he does owe Asians and Codi Rice an apology. There's a new website out there, check it out: members, dot, asianavenue, dot, com, forwardslash, BoycottMcgruder."
1,YAWN...more left-wing nonsense!,"McGruder once again has put out a collection of his inane left-wing garbage for his legion of adoring blame-America bootlickers to purchase. The most laughable aspect of their reverence to rhetoric is when they call it ""progressive"" and ""new thought"". PUH_LEASE. This racist trash is nothing more than the same warmed-over 60's liberalism that has been rejected time after time by American voters. Do youself a favor: save your money and don't but McGruder's book and avoid wasting the minute it takes to read it in the newspaper."
1,McGruder is ugly!,"That alone is reason enough not to buy this book. Ha! Ha! That's satire. Furthermore, no Asian calls himself ""oriental""! McGruder is a hypocrite and an idiot! And his comic book shows it. He wouldn't know what comedy is if it bit him in his skinny behind. The only thing funny about this book is McGruder's picture on the back. He just finished doing comics on ""embarassing black people of the year"" without putting himself in it."
1,Nothing valuable,This is a worthless piece of trash. This is a complete disgrace.Aaron McGruder has nothing intelligent to say in this book to me.I will definitely pass and send warning to all in my social circle.
1,Honestly...!,How can anybody support a cartoonist that is sooo ugly. I'm not surprised he needed an ugly fat guy - Michael Moore - to support him! Birds of a feather flock together.
4,It's just a comic !!!!!,"I think this comic compilation was funny. At times it could be over the top, but it is just a comic people. It's not a novel. It's a comic strip with fictional characters. I really think people are reading too much into this comic strip. It's meant to entertain, nothing more. I just think people need to relax and take it for what it is. Funny!"
3,It's a Comic Strip people!,"AM has some talent and some insight, and he's funny. As for the incredible number of whiny reviewers get over yourselves.What we today would call a ""comic strip"" originated in the US (Ben Franklin drew one of the first) So as for ""stealing asian culture"", it looks like maybe asians ""stole"" it first.I guess I should be offended if I see an asian wearing Levis, because they're ""stealing"" western culture? Or if a black person owns a Honda?There's way too much real injustice in the world to discuss without lowering the level of discourse with Shopping Mall Politcal Correctness."
5,IGNORE S M's comments -- Excellent and aspiring artist,"Ignore S M's comments about Aaron McGruder. He has posted the same message for all of the Boondocks collection. It is obvious that he is not very aware of Mr. McGruder's comic collection.Boondocks are not for people who are hypersensative to the issues of race. The comic is not focused on the issue of race. This comic deals with political issues, entertainment news, and famous world figures. These comics are for people who see a little bit of themselves in the characters and don't mind laughing at what they see.There are always those few people who complain about an artist, comedian, etc. who isn't politically correct. This is America and a free country.If you like the strip, I would encourage you to check out the Boondocks TV show on Cartoon Network. I cannot wait till the series comes out on DVD!!!"
2,"Shocking, then amusing, then tiresome","When I first read Boondocks, I was given a shock by the sometimes bitter anger in it. I kept reading for a couple of years out of curiosity, and found it amusing at times, but it has grown tiresome.The two main characters are unrelentingly and obsessively angry. Occasionally, McGruder pokes fun at their anger, but mostly he affirms it. More interestingly, the anger has turned the cartoonist inward. Originally, Huey hurled his anger at the other characters: an inoffensive girl his age, a black man in a mixed marriage with middle class values who wasn't angry enough to be really black, his teacher, etc. But none of these characters deserved it. So instead of having Huey learn and grow, McGruder turned Huey inward. Now, he sits at home or hangs with his only friend in the whole world, and spends his time ranting about all the things he hates.Frankly, Huey has nothing left but anger and hatred, and I suspect that McGruder is not much different."
5,Give me a break!!!,"While you may not have to like Aaron M. or his comic strip, just remember that comic strips are just that comic strips. It's satire for God's sakes!!! The issues that he touches on in this book and others ( i proudly own the first two books he put out...) often reflect the extremities of his characters (from Huey being ""too damn black"" to his little brother Riley just not getting the concept of hip hop culture and thinking it's all about ""bling blingin' and being gangsta""), which sometimes may not be right. He's not here to respresent the ""entire"" black race but it's just nice to laugh at ourselves (and others) every once in a while. I don't know about you, but i'm enjoying my life and the lives of others, so why not lighten up and laugh. It won't kill you. And to the farmers that wrote negative reviews and didn't leave an e-mail address, you're just better off not posting at all. Nuff said."
4,Not bad if you're looking for nudity.,"Playboy's Girls of the Internet. When you think of Playboy, you think of gorgeous women and a ton of nudity. So how does this video add up? Incredibly well. There are great looking women, all tastefully shot. Playboy has been known for making its models more of a fantasy than a disgusting reality. It lives up to it here. The best part of the Girls of the Internet is that you don't have to wait for the girls to load before you see them."
1,junk?,Made sure i chose right product and manufacturer for proper fitment but product failed 24 days after installation.Very frustrating.Would not recommend.
2,I loved them... but this cd was the beginning of the end,"I suppose you can never go back in time, but I sure wish the Rockapellians could. Back to the days of Barry, Sean, and Elliot. The new version of Rockapella that shows up on this CD pales in comparison to the vocal prowess of the Scott, Jeff, Sean, Barry, and Elliot concoction.This CD was full of cover versions of old ""Summer"" songs with a few thrown together new ones. The one bright light of this whole cd would be the aforementioned Shambala, which is incredible, with 7 Rockapella members. I bought the album the day it came out, and this was my only reason for keeping it.If you really want Rockapella, pick up 2, or In Concert (Forget about Live in Japan - don't get me started on that!!)"
5,Best of Rockapella,This is one o the best selections of Rockapella's work! Hard to come by too- I would highly recommend this if you are looking or something upbeat and different- and no instruments at all!
3,Ode to Summer,"This is perhaps the most thematic of Rockapella's recent recordings, and plays like an ode to summer. There's a nice mix of original tunes and covers of older songs. Rockapella is one of those rare groups that can make a cover of a song sound better than the original, as is the case with their version of ""Shambala"". If this record has a weakness, it's that it seems almost too laid back at times, and lacks a bit of the driving energy evident on the group's other recordings. Still, an excellent album to listen to while kicking back on a lazy summer day."
1,"Sexual Magic, THe S/M Photgraphs","If I could send it back I would. It was totally opposite my expectations. The soft bound book is filled with many grainy black and white prints, often out of focus and poorly lighted. The content of the photos certainly deals with S&M, but if I were a new comer or someone looking for some ""sexual magic"" I believe I would be turned off.The text does a decent job of explaining the concepts, but I am afraid the photos do in whatever good the author was trying to do.Sorry, but the book does not work. Anyone want a used copy?"
4,Poignant and enriching,Excellent collection of prose and poetry which captures the gist of the challenges facing Muslim women in post 9/11 America by giving a voice to the unheard. This anthology provides an interesting starting point for readers to understand Islam through the experiences of women telling their own stories. The material lends itself easily to class discussion and homework and offers the dual asset of being enriching and poignant. A must have!
3,Frost King Cover,This cover was not exactly what I expected. I expected the cover to fit my unit better and have a stronger tie band to keep it on the unit.
1,Buy it if you want to lose it?!,This thing flew away a few times due to its flimsy strap and once I found it 3 houses down! How can they expect a gimpy strap to hold down the what is essentially plastic when even small winds blow it away!Save yourself the waste and get something else.
4,It did the job,It fits like it was made for the A/C unit. I wished it was longer. We will see how it holds up.
4,Fit Perfectly,I wanted something to cover my units during the winter and I orderd these. they fit perfectly and they cost half the price as the ones at Home Depot.
3,Works for the intended purpose and lasts the Iowa winters,Pretty standard material from what I've seen in other air conditioner covers. The strap used to wrap around it is pretty jeep so after one winter we're going to use a rope or bunge straps this year. It works well at covering and keeping the snow/ice out and the material has help up so far. At this price I would buy another if it lasts me 1-2 more winters.
4,Halloween costume,"Adorable costume, definitely worth the fun, but:1. Hat is huge, fixed it with a thin rubber band and some insert inside to keep it on.2. Costume is small. My son is 3.5 yrs, tall and slender - and he could just fit it. I am not sure how a 6yrs old would put it on?"
3,It will be a one night only costume,"Purchased for 4 yr old boy, wears size 4T. The overall appearance is very cute and my grandson loved the way it looks in the picture. Reality, however, is a thin plastic hat with no strap to keep it on, thin foam material on shoe covers. The openings on the costume body and the shoe covers are very small. Unable to pull the shoe covers over the foot with the shoe on, have to take shoe off, slide cover over foot, then put on shoe. The costume body has to be put on over the head, with child's arms held over the head, completely straight up and no movement. No wiggle room in the armholes. The opening at the neck of the costume is only 5 inches long, so there is no room to ""stretch"" the neck opening. Love the ""candy catcher"" pocket, Mike's eye is a plastic plate that fits into slots on the costume front. I hope he will have fun with it for one night, as long as he stands still it should work out."
3,Adorable Costume!,It is an adorable costume!!! ...But....Sizing is not accurate - it is small & will fit a 4T size at the max. The eye keeps falling off! The candy pouch is not very practical. But its still cute!
4,"Fits 2 year old son, except the hat","This costume is absolutely adorable and looks great! My son is only two years old, and it fits him with no problems. The hat however is enormous! It feels like its sized to fit adults, and I don't even think a teenager could fit the hat! The eye on Mike comes off pretty easily as well, as it stays on with just four slots around inside the suit, but they're only extend into the suit 1""-2"".Overall though, I am very happy with the purchase especially because my son was so happy in it."
4,Not just for Halloween,My son loves this Costume. He loves Monsters INC in general so when I got him this costume for Halloween he was all psyched out about it. He still wears it when he watches Monsters inc. Sadly the Eyeball which is made of Plastic broke and its kinda hard to repair. Other than that the quality of this Costume is good to very good depending how often your toddler dresses up lol. Pair the costume with green pants or tights and it really comes close to being Mike.The front pocket comes in handy as well as for the kids do not need to carry a Trick or Treat bag for Halloween keeping their hands free for you to hold on to them.
2,Cute but helmet is too big and body quite snug,The helmet is too big even for my husband and the body suit is small. Our son was not comfortable in it really either. It is cute though.
2,Runs VERY VERY SMALL!!!,"My 2 yr old is 34 lbs, 37"" and this costume doesn't fit without some alterations. The opening on the bottom of the costume is so small, I couldn't pull it down around my son's shoulders and hips when slipping it over his head. I had to slice the back open and re-fasten with extended velcro tabs. The hat is gigantic, but I'll just wear it when we go trick or treating. Overall, I feel like I overspent for this costume and I wish returns were easier."
2,Really cute but there's sharp plastic around the neck.,"We got this for my son for Halloween this year. My son is almost 2, about 24lb and it fit him pretty well except for the helmet. The helmet was too big for even me and I'm a 200+lb adult male. Unfortunately there was a huge problem with the way this outfit was designed around the neck. There's a thin very sharp piece of plastic that goes around the entire neck that the foam is supposed to protect your child from but it does a pathetic job. My son fell once while wearing the outfit and the sharp plastic above the eyeball cut up his neck and underneath his little chin. After putting some bandages under his chin we had to put tape all over sharp plastic edge before we could continue trick or treating. It's really a cute outfit and we got some great pictures but it's stupidly designed and dangerous right out of the box for kids to wear."
4,Reviewers were right about the size!,"We bought this for our 2 year old based on the reviews it has gotten regarding its size. And boy were they right! It says up to six, but it fits my son! It is only a little big, but depending on how much he grows, I'm not sure it would fit next Halloween. The hat, however, is HUGE. I haven't figured out a way for it to stay on him yet. I hope I do because this is a cute costume!They eyeball was dented and the dent did not fully come out. It doesn't affect the look too much, but I wish it wasn't dented at all.Overall, cute costume with the convience of a candy pouch, was worth it!(The 4 stars is because of the huge hat and dented eye.)"
4,Great Costume but the sizing is very off.,This costume was a huge hit. It fit my son perfect. He is 18 months and wears a size 2T and he is about as big a a two year old. The costume says it fits up to size 6 but I don't see how that is possible. It is a little tough to get on but once it is on it is on it seems to fit just fine. The eye is not soft it is hard and plastic and is removable so my son kept taking it off. You have to put the costume on without the eye and then put the eye on witch can make it difficult if your kiddo is always on the go and tough to catch like mine. If the eye were a soft sort of squishy rubber material that was attached to the costume it self it would have been perfect. The hat was way too big. It fit my fiance. Considering all that I would still by it but not for a child older then three and hopefully the three year old is a small one.
4,Small size- reasonable product,"I bought this costume for my 2 year old (size 2T, 26 lbs, approx 34"") the costume fit great, could easliy go up to a 3T. I tried it on my 4 year old daughter (4t/5t, 36 lbs, 41"") it was snug but fit.The hat is huge but will work.quality is as expected- sturdy enough to last for halloween but will surely come apart with extended play."
4,Mike Candy Catcher Costume,This product is adorable and my nephew loved it. The costume runs very small. It states it fits up to Age 6 . . . my nephew just turned 3 and is tiny for his age and the costume was very snug.
4,Mikey costume!,"We loved this costume! However, just a note - it runs small, for sure - The arm holes are tiny + the my sons head just about fit through the head hole. The eye is a plastic add-on + can pop off, which is slightly annoying. The hat is huge. But, it is a cute costume for a Monsters Inc. lover :-)"
2,You can skip this one,"This film had potential, but the storyline collapses and really leaves the audience disappointed. First, let me start with the background music. Music plays an important role in a film. The quirky instrumental that continually played throughout the film set a bad tone. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a thriller or a comedy. Turns out I was watching neither. The film lacked any sort of thrills or edge of the seat terror. The drama was at a minimum, and the few comedic moments fall flat. If you're watching this for Hayden, you'll be disappointed. She doesn't have alot of dialogue. If its Tim Daly you want, well, his character is a total bore. Overall, the reveal at the end is a let down. The film is only 77 minutes long, but I still felt I've been cheated precious moments of my life."
2,How does this rate 5 stars?,This had good potential but it just fell flat. At one point you're watching her pour juice like it is some big to-do. Tim Daly is just weird and creepy. Hayden doesn't make much of an appearance throughout and you never understand why the fascination. Terrible.
1,Never got to watch the movie - misleading DVD!,"Okay, so I ordered this DVD. It arrived in great condition.It distinctly says this DVD is ""English captioned"" on the back. I tried to watch it and couldn't. Why?Because yet again, the captions were NOT on the DVD.So, yet again, I have had to apply in order to get another refund.It really annoys me that some companies do not seem to be aware of what is needed to show the captions and do notinstall a menu option for switching the captions on or just don't bother putting them on.This makes me appreciate the hard work that some DVD companies do in order to make sure their DVDs arecaptioned properly."
5,Flute Buyers!,"I recieved a booklet of some of the best flutes from my band teacher about two weeks ago, and spotted this alto. Alto flutes are usually a little more difficult to play, because they need more breath support, and I would not recommend buying it if you haven't learned how to play the flute, or if you play the piccilo. The keys are awfully large.When I ercieved this flute, I thought I got a gift from heaven. Jupiter is one of the best flute makers ever."
2,"Pretentious, overwrought suburban design ideas","If your taste in design runs to pretentious, overwrought suburban kitsch, then by all means buy this book. Otherwise, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for bathroom design ideas. Containing very little practical information, each visual image presented was more horrible than the last. Bathrooms jammed with knicknacks like little miniature doll houses and exercise equipment. Bathrooms that appeared to double as sitting rooms with overstuffed furniture, and so on. Impractical, expensive, and ugly. yuck."
2,Best thing is the cover,"The best bathroom is the one on the cover of the book. Inside there is a lot of more of same, which means the same solutions that have been covered in similar books. I'm still looking for a great Bath book."
4,g-o-o-d---g-a-m-e,"are you all crazy?I have read many reviews of this game before I bought it.People write: ""pixelled Grphics,..blablabla"" and""No music, etc.,etc,.."" also""few colors,...."" and""stupid enemies,...""When you think of a normal FP Shooter,you are right, of course,but remember: this game is packed into a 5cm wide, 3cm high and 5mm thick plastic case - You can't expect that much.For a GameBoy, this is a great Game.( Remember: Supermarioland 1 needs more space!)I think: ""Playing a first-person-shooter while going by bus is simply fun. Too, if it's a bit pixellated when you get close to a wall or somethin! """
5,Just play it!,"No, I didn't think it was possible til I played this game. The graphics are extremely nice, which is complimented by the fact that there is never any slowdown. That means the framerate is smooth, always. The missions are a blast! They have variety that sometimes may actual cause you to think, but it won't be the usual stupid: Find keycard 1, go to door A and unlock it till you are insane. The mission objectives are things like: escape from a building before a bomb blows up, snipe Sever (main character), Kill Mills( the guy you try to save in the mission before). The sound is ok: no music, just grunts and gunshots, but don't get me wrong the actual sounds are realistic. If you like shooters and have a gameboy you'll love this game."
2,Not like Goldeneye...,"This game isn't all that bad, but it's more like Doom or Duke Nuke 'Em. This is not even close to Goldeneye which one of the reviewers below had stated. The graphics are so-so, and the gameplay gets kind of boring after just a few run-throughs. To summarize...if you like games such as Doom, then you'll probably like this as a portable. If you think it's going to be like Goldeneye, then don't even bother and save your money for something else."
3,save your money,This game is ok but there are much better games out there. here is my breakdown of the game.graphics: 8/10controls: 6/10replay value: 4/10
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This game is terrible. Also very fake, for example, I used an entire G-11 Machine Gun clip on one SWAT soldier, Doom is Much better.Terrible storyline and very bad gameplay!"
1,The Game that Tried to be Wolfenstein....But Why?,"First off, let me start off by saying, that i bought this game, and by later that day I was taking it back. For me, personally I like eye-candy style games which keep my attention through wonderful gameplay and amazing graphics. I must say, for the most part, that this game bored me, lacked the graphics that I normally enjoy, the depth of gameplay was prehistoric, and personally I would pick a third person side-scroller any day over this game."
5,WOW! WOW!!,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I looked at these reviews on Amazon.com but I was still a little unsure. I got the game. Opened the package, picked ecks and started playing. IT IS AMAZING. The gun in front of you is like Gamecube graphics. The rest of the graphics are like N64 graphics in the first 007 on it.But for a gameboy? All I can say is WOW! It's fully panoramic and first person, there is strafing, opening doors. Running up stairs, hidden elavators and vent, like 20 guns, crouching, a very good plot, story, fun missions, 12 levels able to be done with either ecks or sever, (each has a different thing to do. Example: Ecks: chase Sever and don't lose sight. Sever:make sure Ecks doesn't follow.)which makes it like 24 levels, and fun. IT IS AN AMAZING GAME"
1,NO PUNCTUATION IN KINDLE VERSION,"I started reading this series & was excited to get the next story. This is the worst formatted book I have received for my Kindle!!! There is no punctuation to tell when someone is speaking.Totally frustrating to try to tell if they are speaking or thinking or what, I have to keep rereading to follow the story. I think its probably a good story, but the author & Amazon should be ashamed to take $$ for an ebook that is not written correctly!!!"
5,"Finally, a band about music","In mid-August I had the opportunity of hearing about a new band called Cavern, I popped in the demo and was taken a-back by the amazing sound. Although the sound manager used was obviously a novice, I knew for a fact that these kids had a sound that was pure and true. If anyone had done it for the love of the music,I believe it was this group of future stars. Those gentlemen have got a pure hit on their hands with Silver, and I don't doubt that there will be another c.d. to follow!"
4,a good handy resume book,"""The Resume Handbook"" delivers a quick, handy tool to writing the resume. It contains resume samples for managers, career changers, recent graduates and much more. Even though I recommend this book to anyone new to writing the resume, I highly suggest readers to read beyond this book. This book only gives general guidelines to what good and bad resumes look like. It does not contain extensive details on how to write each section (objective, profile, work history, etc) like many other resume books. Again, this book is useful, but definitely not enough to teach you on how to write a outstanding resume."
3,Works for hobby soldering but a little flimsy,"Construction is mostly plastic and feels a little flimsy. However, it does keep the solder fumes away from one's face without getting in the way."
2,"Does not work, it just creates turbulence in the air.","I had high hopes for this fume extractor, but it just doesn't work.When I start using it, I see the fumes scatter in all directions. I also noticed that if I remove the rotating filter, it works better, but no filter means that the fumes stay in my work area."
4,OLD FILM FULL OF MEMORIES,I bought this because it had Jack Lord in it and I was a big fan of Jack Lord back in the day of Stoney Burke. My family had been to Williamsburg about every other year for our summer vacation and I remember seeing this short film in the theatre there before touring the facilities. It brought back fond memories. Although it is a short documentary on the beginnings of our country it still holds its charm. If you are actually looking for a typical movie this is not what you are looking for but if you remember the shortie as a kid-- it is a memory reminder.
3,Interesting historical artifact,"This DVD consists of a 37-minute film made for Colonial Williamsburg in the 50's, and two short documentaries: one on the restoration of the film, and the second an introduction to Colonial Williamsburg.The acting in the little movie is pretty wooden, but the costumes look great. It's primarily of interest as Colonial Williamsburg nostalgia, although it is interesting that the ""patriot"" in the title has many misgivings about turning against England. Most movies about this period seem to show everyone as having already made up their mind.Jack Lord and John McGiver (in a brief cameo) are the only stars you'll recognize. Bernard Herrmann did the music!The two little documentaries are a nice complement to the film, but are a little too brief.At one point members of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation received copies of this free as a membership benefit."
2,Second-rate teen sex romp,"As you could probably tell from the title, this is a pretty simplistic film. The basic plot is a group of 5 ladies going to ""Band Nationals"" in Florida have their bus break down and run into a town that celebrates wild and raunchy spring break antics.This movie aspires to such heights of other teen sex comedies as ""American Pie"" or even back to ""Porky's."" However, though there are some chuckles, the film really isn't all that funny. You will get some gratuitous nudity, but if you have any interest in anything other than that, you will likely be disappointed in this one."
2,Macbeth - rating refers to service not Wm Shakespeare's writing,"It is foolish of you to ask for a rating for a Shakespeare classic. Of course, Macbeth is worth five stars. However, the condition of the book I received hardly rates two. It is full of scribbled comments, making the play barely legible in places. I was very disappointed."
5,Excellent product!!!!,"This booster seat is comfortable and easy to carry on planes, exchanges easy from one vehicle to another, and has a cup holder too. Cover is removable, easy to wash and to install again. Great product!"
1,Do not buy it!,"Connect3D is not a normal company, it is a fraud company. And officially they are out of business, their phones are not answering. You will NEVER get any support from them; they will never honor any commitments. Make a search online ""Connect3d rebates"" - and you will easily find the story. There is a lawsuit filed against them, do not add your name to the names of people that were already fooled by Connect3d."
2,Build Quality is very low,"I bought this and it came with 3 screws that were striped. I did not strip them, they came that way. My friend who has a knack for these things helped me drill one of the screws out and we got in it. Also the shell is very flimsy and dents easily."
2,Good start but disappointing,"In the first 2 chapters the authors do a good job of explaining why variable costing is better than full absorption costing. Thereafter the book fails to add much more than that. I learned in university that variable costing is better than full absorption costing, so this is nothing new - what would be more useful would be ways to use both systems simultaneously, seeing as full absorption costing will be with us for SEC and IRS reporting purposes.Great start, but left with a feeling that I hadn't really learned much in the end."
3,toc management accounting,item as described - good conditions.Had to pay additional VAT - as value declared 55$ for a used book :-(
3,A Thesis,"This book is jam packed with good information. The case studies are good and the subjects are well researched and presented. Unfortunately, it reads like the author's Thesis."
4,Practical,"This book is extramly practical for all translators touching on subjects like copyrights and globalization. The relationship Author-Translator- Culture is thoroghly covered. My immediate sensation after finishing reading this book was to take action, and to help improve the status of a translator who is usually seen as secondary to author."
4,Civilian wasn't that bad,"I'm pretty hardcore Giant, I learnt to play bass from Glass House, FreeHand (+Crimso). I think that, despite being a beat-oriented, semi-new wave offering, Civilian had a good sound and some good moments, particularly Underground. I really liked it better than Giant for a Day and Missing Piece, 2 of their other more 'commercial' offerings. I saw this tour as well, at Bill Graham's Old Waldorf. They stuck to the new stuff, but I thought it worked, although I felt sad that they did sort of have to try to 'sell out', but those were tough days for progrock. Remember Asia and Kayak?"
5,Alaska's Wolfman,"Bought this book for my husband, who likes a good true story and he said that it is one of the most amazing books he has read to date.So if you like a good action packed story telling of this man's survival skills in a harsh country, then this is the book to read.Will be buying more books by Jim Rearden."
5,The best of the best,I have lived in Alaska for 10 years and can't believe I just heard about this book. I bought it yesterday and have not been able to put it down since I opened it.Not only is it an excellent read but I am learning a lot of tips about wilderness survival. It is about the best adventure book I have ever read.
5,Alaska's Wolf Man,If you thought you were a tough outdoorsman - think again. This is an amazing adventure of an early 1900's outdoorsman. His adventures take your breath away.
2,Prestige Automatic Waterproof Eye Liner,"Color: Smokey Green. Not what I expected. More brown than green. And, it subs off easily, during normal use."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"We got this phone as a wedding gift not more that six months ago. After about three months, it began malfunctioning. Sometimes, when the phone rang and you tried to answer it, it would not answer. It would also not charge when you put it back on the base, so the battery would go dead and there was nothing we could do. We tried to contact Panasonic to have it fixed, but we kept getting the customer no-service run around and finally gave up. I recently accidentally dropped the phone off the kitchen counter, and the antenna broke-so it's not too durable either. I came to Amazon.com and purchased the VTech VT 1920c digital cordless phone with caller ID - strangly...the same price as this phone."
2,Panasonic fails,"I have purchased this phone twice now. Panasonic usually makes quality products, but both phones were duds! The antenna bends and therefore the clarity isn't so great."
2,A Good Phone If Your Deaf,"I brought this phone twice, thinking that the first one was defective.It had a very loud destortion level that seemed to increase with the length of time one stayed on the phone. The speakerphone worked great, the handset was comfortable, its just to bad i couldn't understand anyone I was talking to with the handset. Look somewhere else."
3,Pretty but some scratches,This bed is very pretty but the instructions were not very detailed so it was hard to puf together. Also it did not come with the two long metal parts to hold up the matress! So my matress will be sitting on the ground until i can find the bars!
1,"""Day Bed"" does not come with frame!","Bed ""frame"" was beautiful and arrived timely-- but does not come with the actual bed frame! So it took no time at all to assemble the three parts (the back and sides), but we have had to put mattress on cinderblocks until we can order a frame! Not happy."
2,"nice design, but needs improvement","The silit bread box has a very unique design, however it can use some improvement. First of all the roll back is made of breakable glass. It should be made of some form of unbreakable glass. My first one came with the glass shattered, the second one came with the frame bend. I gave up. I don't want to take any more chances, but I trully love the attractive bread box. If in the future they correct it, I will be the first one in line to buy it."
2,Not Want I Thought It Would Be,Not A JLH fan. I have some of his work and appreciate it. Love the Heat. I was hoping this was a jam with Heat doing (singing) work with JLH. They are pretty much the backup band. It's pretty much a JLH album with CH backing.
4,Best of Both!,What a fantastic combination - John Lee Hooker singing with one of the most underrated blues bands - Canned Heat - backing him up.
1,Don't waste your money,"There are plenty of John Lee Hooker cds that are way better than this one. It is boring. Besides, Canned heat has a double disc best of release that makes all others seem unnecessary."
5,Book helped focus my life,"I read this book in college - think I found it in the Whole Earth Catalog, which is going back a long way. It really helped focusing down into detailed actions and results - which wasn't as popular a topic then as it is now. Now, for example, the Getting Things Done methodology, from David Allen, for example, keys on actions and results."
2,Angel Eyes by Thea Devine,I found this book after reading several other books by Devine and I found it to be not as good as her others. The sexiness was similar (pretty hot)but the female character was very wishy washy. The setting was Americana/Western which was different than other settings from her. The general plot about a outlaw on the run was a well used one and it did not read as well as Devine's other books.If you want to start out on a better book by her try Desired(This one sizzles!).
3,528L Valve Trombone,"It's Ok for starting out or if only playing a 3rd part but I find it very stuffy and hard to blow above top G (sat on the stave-treble clef), also the tuning is difficult. Personally I prefer a valve king 3B legend or bach Srad although a little more pricy.Not a bad horn for Jupiter."
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC !!! EARTHA ROCKS !!!,THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF EARTHA'S BEST PERFORMANCES !!!SHE'S SENSATIONAL ! REALLY SEXY AND TALENTED ! GORGEOUS CAREER !WONDERFUL TASTE ! FABULOUS VOICE !A MUST-HAVE ! SHE'S STILL ROCKING !
5,Get this CD!,"This CD is an anthology of fifteen songs taken from Blossom's own label, Daffodil Records. It is an assemblage of some of her best work. My personal favorite is ""Bring All Your Love Along,"" which she recorded with Bob Dorough. At the present time this song can be found on no other Blossom Dearie CD. Although some of the material can now be found on other BD discs, there is a sufficient number of songs found nowhere else to make this pressing an important part of your collection. To be honest, on any of Blossom's recordings there are some songs I like better than others. This one contains the cream of the crop from start to finish."
3,"Great phone, but poor battery life","We've had the KXTC-1866 for about a year and have found it's great except for two issues. First, the battery runs down quite rapidly. We usually get about a half-hour of talk time. Second, the volume of the message payback is very poor on remote pickup, even if we set the volume to max. I am putting in a new battery in hopes that it was defective."
2,Was fun while it lasted,I loved this phone. It had great features and it seemed well made and durable. Everyone in my family liked the phone. I thought I had finally found the perfect cordless phone. It stopped working after approximately 28 days. So I continue in my quest for the perfect cordless phone.
3,Almost what I wanted,"Sound quality is not great but passable, a headset fixes that. Reception has been great, and the handset is much more solid than the one with the AT&T phone/answerer it replaces. But, while the answering machine here is fine I miss the great features of the AT&T unit.To do it again I'd buy an AT&T answering machine and a sep. cordless phone. Seems like you can't get the best of both worlds in one."
4,Products by Panasonic,"Though Panasonic consistently produce quality products, their prices may be higher than other competitive brands. This particular phone has many convenient features. The battery life on such phone is short that is to be expected. The upside is that this phone does charge the battery fairly quick to the spec. The range varies, depends where you live and where you place the base. I would recommend to find a good central location for the base. The antenna is something that of a concern. It is rigid and potential breakage if not careful. Overall, I say this is a great phone with above average price for these specs and quality."
2,very small handset,"We have been looking for a 900 Mhz DSS phone with answeringmachine for a couple of weeks (in white only). I thought this phonewould be good, but I went to a store to check it out... and found thehandset is very small and thin. It is so small it is difficult tohold the phone between your sholder and ear. I didn't want the extraexpense of buying a headset, so we passed"
3,Unsatisfied Daddy,"I liked the fact that the tires came inflated and the product arrived undamaged. While putting the wagon together I ran into missing parts, a wheel washer and a cotter pin. Without these parts the the wheel would fall off. No big deal im a tool man and I have extra washers and pins. The pull bar has a lot play where it connects to the front axle, not helpful when trying to make turns. I wrapped the bolt with some electric tape that connects the pull bar to the axle and used some washers. This helped with the loosness in the pull bar. After all this work the wagon is more of what I expected. Its a good thing I bought the wagon in advance to make the necessary repairs."
1,I'd like to Slaughter this Disc,"having read, or more accurately skimmed through, the latest issue of rue morgue there was a section, one page, on splatter porn, or whatever it's called.i almost ALMOST bought this, based on it's low low price, and I am sincerely glad i chose not to, my friend instead picked it up, having wanted to see it for some time.so, i just watched it no more than 6 hours ago, and i can say, without a doubt, it was one of the most dull, unshocking films i've ever seen.and apparently it's ""antiporn"". yeah, this film is antiporn like natural born killers was a statement against the medias obsession with blood and death.0 stars."
3,slaughter disc : a tale from the carnal morgue,"FIRST OF ALL,I GAVE A 3 STARS BECAUSE I LEARN SOMETHING , PORN CAN KILL!!!!! AND IT CAN KILL YOU WALLET TOO ,DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE , RENT IT. THE GORE ;WHAT GORE? A FEW SLASHING NECKS,I CAN EVEN DO THAT AT HOME WITH SOME BREAD AND KETCHUP,THE SEXUAL SCENES TO LONG AND BORING IN OTHER WORDS JUST RENT IT IF YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY."
1,Must Have Gotten A Bad Batch,"This was not at all what I expected. I don't know if that batch I got was old or what, but it did not have truffle flavor! I could see the truffle in the butter, but there was none of that intense earthy aroma. Undeterred, I proceeded to use it to season my Thanksgiving turkey. I was so disappointed. Because I was depending on the butter almost exclusively for flavor, the turkey was bland.I ended up using the truffle and salt mix I purchased from Williams-Sonoma at the table. This was not the stellar meal I had planned. For Christmas, I used the same technique on cornish hens. This time, I used shelf-stable truffle butter from Williams-Sonoma. The birds were outstanding."
1,Not as expected...,"Having tried and loved the D'Artangnan white truffle butter, I bought the black for a risotto. Not sure if i got a bad batch, but I found NO truffle flavor or aroma whatsoever. I see truffle looking bits but it tastes like butter with soy sauce. Quite disappointing."
3,THEY CAN TAKE A POUNDING,FOR THE PRICE YOU CANT GO WRONGI'M USEING IT FOR A STEREO COOLERI WAS EXPECTING MORE PUNCH FROM THEMBUT THEY SOUND OK..HOWEVER I HAVE THEM AT FULL VOLUME OUTPUT AND THEY TAKE THE BEATING
4,"for the price, the way to go, even for mild audiophiles","it's for a boat, so open air, and the push a fair amount of sound for not having walls to bounce off of. I added them to my pontoon that already had 2 speakers (that suck, but are good enough for a boat) and this made the entire system round out and bump.Hit it Fresh Prince.. it's summertime. (lol)"
4,Good speakers for the money,"First off, would have given 5 stars but it did not come with a pattern to cut out a hole in my custom built box. With the small lip, its hard to guess\measure where to cut the hole, but I made it work. Other than that, great speakers. Put 1 in my Rhino side-by-side under the drivers seat and paired it with a PYLE PLMRA420 4-Channel 1,000-Watt also purchased from amazon (run my door speakers off of the other 2 chanels). Hits hard for an 8"" 400w, although I know pyle has a tendancy to over-rate their products wattage (and also, due to lack of room under the rhino's seat, my box was only .6ish cubic feet which is below the recommended .7 - 1.0 cubic feet for 8"" subs). But it hits hard enough for me. Seems to be holding up pretty well as far as the ""marine"" part goes, but its only been 2 weeks and 1 powerwashing session, but it still works. You cant beat this speaker for the money. And if it breaks.....get another! 20 bucks aint bad for a marine sub if it'll last a year"
3,"A few too many coincidences, but still fun","For a change, trouble finds Mrs. Pollifax instead of the other way around, when she finds a young woman hiding out in her closet. An extended chase ensues, ending up with Mrs. Pollifax and Kadi, the young woman, hiding out in a carnival subsidized by Mrs. P's CIA friends for just such a purpose. The threads are complex, and there are a few more coincidences than are comfortable, but it all boils down to a plot to take over the African country where Kadi grew up and where her friend Sammy has a politically prominent position.It's another enjoyable Pollifax romp, weakened a bit by the coincidences, but again brilliantly read by Barbara Rosenblat, whose skill I admire ever more increasingly with each new voice she comes up with."
2,Finally tired of the absurdity,"Mrs. Pollifax helps a frightened girl she finds hiding in her house escape from the thugs pursuing her, and winds up preventing the murder of an African king.I have finally tired of this series. While the characters remain likable, the convoluted and coincidental plot (entirely typical of the series) simply irritated me. I got halfway through and quit."
5,Terrific :),"I think this is one of the best books yet. It was exciting, funny and a great summertime novel."
4,Good cd!!!!,"I love this cd, but I didn't like the fact that some of the songs had swear words in them... I love the songs, I just have trouble with the language, so I don't actually listen to it much.... at least, definitely not as much as I would have if those few songs were cleaned up.Recommendation! : read the lyrics to ""Hey Kid"",""Blame"", and ""Good to be Here"" before buying this cd! (the others too, if you want to, but those are ones I definitely remember as having inappropriate themes or language for the young teens who will make up most of the buyers of this cd.)"
4,Correction,"Hybrid Moments is a Misfits cover, not an original song. When performed live at Lollapalooza 2003, Nick Oliveri (former Queens of the Stone Age bassist) sang."
4,fantastic future fiction,"I read this entrancing tale in 2 days -- i could not put it down. I have never read sci-fi and I dont think that is what this is.. it is more a modern mythological quest. I found it wonderful. If you are really concerned that the characters stay true to Hindu mythology, dont read this. Lighten-up. This isnt the Gita, this is fiction and it is a lot of fun!"
2,Disappointing,What a waste... Quite a few good ideas but so badly worked out... After the first fifty pages I had to force myself to read on. Don't waste your money.
1,"Interesting at first, but ultimately just setup for sequels","The novel began well enough, and the idea of a sort of decaying technological society that's lost control of its technology can be interesting (though it's been done to death), but in the end the book only touches on the surface of the ideas it's trying to get across. Why? As I approached the final chapters, it became obvious that the intention was never to tell the story in this novel: Shiva 3000 is clearly just the set-up for a Riverworld-like series of stories based on the world described here.How will things work out during the next several novels? I felt so cheated by the cheap ending that I won't be able to tell you, because I'm not going to be reading the rest of this."
1,Lousy book,This book creates a mockery of the Hindu religion. It should not only be unread... but banned. The only reason it got one star was because there's no 0 stars.
3,Another great effort from a founding Tubes member,"I usually don't go to the Mall. But When Bill Spooner opened one up, it was worth the trip. This shophmore release from (one of the the fromer Tubes members)is just a little slow getting off the ground.But the booster rockets engage and the flight is most enjoyable. Of special note is the title song Mall to Mars. Firm backing in all areas and a solid vocal preformance, make this kick ass. Spooner has always had a good sense for being a bit cyinical and this is eveident in the lyrics you hear throughtout these offerings. It adds additional entertainment to his story telling. Upscale Yuppie and all the following songs also present solid backing vocals. And the tremandous backing from Prairie Prince on drums doesn't hurt at all !!! Spooner does a great jobs with his vocal presentation but he could use some extra help to add some additional ""body"" with the presntation. Over all well worth the purchase."
3,Any release by a Tubes member is a good one,"Spooner's second solo disc (following the uneven but interesting ""First C.H.U.D."" in 1985) finds good ole Sputnik with his sense of humor still intact. Perhaps the track ""They Kicked Me Out Of The Band"" is a bit of a cathartic release for him, too. Not all of the material shines, but his cover of Richard and Linda Thompson's ""Dimming of the Day"" pre-dates Bonnie Raitt's version by a year or two and is just as good. ""Upscale...Blues"" is note-for-note Sputnik, and ""Hermuta"" is a track from the EARLY days of the Tubes (or The Beans, or however far back you want to take it). Could have done without the ""Star Trek"" theme and the pedestrian ""Grooves In Orbit"". But to the Tubes fans everywhere this is an indispensible collector's item. Bill would release solo disc #3 ""Demolicious"" soon after, and see if you can track down some tunes by his sometime-band The Folk-Ups."
4,"A Good Album, but not his best","Back Of My Mind has some wonderful tracks like ""Someday"", ""Never Stop Believing"", ""Alibi"", and ""Swept Away"", but it certainly is not Cross' best work. Still, I think it's great that amazon.com offers Chris' long out-of-print albums. Chances are you've never heard most of the songs that are on these albums, and it would be a shame for you to pass them up.For his best work, I think you should try Rendezvous, or Every Turn of the World. Another Page and his self-titled album are perenial classics as well."
3,"4 great songs, the rest...ok","I really love the ballads on this album 'alibi' is sublime, with a lovely synth solo and a nice melody. 'Swept away' is gorgeous and probably the best here. 'I will (take you forever)' is a nice duet. I also like 'Someday' and find this a cathcy melodic track. The rest is ok, but no where near the gorgeous songs on 'Another page'."
4,One of Larry's best early lead performances of the nineties,Deep Cover is Fish's third best performances of the early nineties behind Boyz N The Hood and What's Love Got To Do With It. The character he plays in Deep Cover is a smooth cop who gets in over his head when he goes undercover. Jeff Goldblum makea great bad guy and the direction by Bill Duke was also very good following A Rage In Harlem from a year earlier.
4,Deep Cover,"I consider the song selections very good. Basically, I purchased the CD for the title cut. In my opinion, it is Dr. Dre's and Snoop's best cut together ever."
3,Not bad for its ilk,"Fishburne delivers a fine performance as an undercover narcotics agent who eventually gets hooked to the dope himself. There is also good support from Goldblum as his attorney. A credible score as well, but not much else to distinguish it from plenty of its ilk. Ambitiously done, but contrived and standardly filmed."
5,"awesome, One of the best","I watched this movie over a hundred times , and i still havent gotten sick of it. its a Pure classic. Larry Fishburne and Jeff Goldblum just blow the screen away. Although it does get a little shady towards the end, the film is filled with one-liners galore. When asked if he ever had sex with two woman at the same time , Fishburne immediateley replies ""yeah, your mother and your father"". The best thing about it is the unpredictability with which it unfolds. you never know what will happen next, and what you expect to happen suddenly doesnt. A definite must see. Narrated by Fishburne with a taste for Urban Poetry"" The jungle Creed, say the strongest feed, on any prey they can. And i was branded beast, at every feast, before i ever became a man.""Excellent movie."
2,Same Old Drama,"I am sick of movies being hyped up and they don't measure up to the talk. Deep Cover was a rip off of a lot of other drug-mob films I've seen. The director used the urban setting as a ploy to make the audience think it was seeing something different. People compared it to New Jack City. NJC wasn't great but it wins over Deep Cover hands down. This movie was a mess and there was no point to anything the characters did. Laurence Fishburne said his lines so slowly, as if he felt the director would butt in. God I wish he had! Jeff Goldblum was supposed to be tough but was nothing but a big wimp. Victoria Dillard couldn't act to save her life ( what was the reason she was there? ) the woman didn't do anything important! I guess this is good if you like violence with nothing to show for it. If you're looking for a film like this that handles the modern-day mob/drug life better I'd check out something else."
5,187 on an undercover cop...,"This movie was probably meant to be a drama, and for the most part it is, except for many lines and scenes that lie in the comedy genre. Made back when Fishburne went by Larry, it offers a gritty look at the drugworld surrounding each and every one of us. D.A.R.E. it is not and Goldblum portrays an excellent drugdealer trying to make that last big score. Rent it, because I know you'll enjoy the scene where ""Felix"" is thrown out of the limo...and hey its got a good soundtrack too (dogg reprazentin). We'll have shrimp, barbecue jumbo shrimp"
2,Predictable and a bit dull,"Another undercover cop trying to snare some big Hispanic drug dealers. This type of thing happened every week on Miami Vice. Here, the setting is LA, but the theme is the same. Fishburn smolders a bit too much, and Jeff Goldblum is his usual greasy self. The cutting and editing are circa early 90s and seem a little dated now. If you can't find anything else to watch, this may suffice."
5,I Am Amazed There Aren't More Reviews On This Movie!,"Quite simply...a great flick, I ran into this movie by accident, just as I have so many other cool things. This movie is great and totally underrated. Do yourself a favor and the next time you are looking for a movie and you don't know what to get, eliminate the risk...check out this movie...I think you will pleasantly surprised."
4,Attempts to elevate itself...,"...above the level of other black action movies by incorporating a whole rainbow of characters. Somewhat awkward is the inclusion of Jeff Glodblum, playing against type as a hulked-out action figure, but he carries the part well. Exhibits a certain amount of racism toward Hispanic characters, but it's only a two-hour movie, it can't please everyone. Perhaps not the perfect urban crime movie, it cetrainly rises head and shoulders above the pack.Incidentally, to the reviewer below, the actor you're referring to is not Clarence Thomas III. Clarence Thomas is a Supreme Court Justice. The actor is Clarence Williams III, and he played Link on the Mod Squad."
2,zune cradle,"It worked great until I put a thin silicon case on my zune, now it doesn't fit. It seems like they could have left a little extra room in the opening..."
5,Nice basic dock,This is a great little dock. I have it hooked up to the PC with the USB cable that came with my first generation 30GB Zune. Zune fits nicely in the cradle.Great find. Highly recommended.
4,Simple but functional.,"This dock is very well-designed. It holds the Zune snugly, is easy to insert and remove the Zune from, and looks very nice on my desk. It compliments the Zune's design very well with its neutral black doubleshot look.Because it fits snugly and recessed, the dock will NOT work if your Zune in a case. It's very easy to pop the sync cable out of the back, however, so you can easily plug an encased Zune in without needing to have a spare cable plugged in.If you pick up an A/V cable and the remote control, the dock will allow you to use your Zune as a jukebox on your TV. If you want this functionality, however, you're better off just getting the home A/V pack."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ZUNE 80G,Ugh.Buy Zune Dock v2. Now I have a gift for my friend with a 1st gen Zune.
1,not even a zune,i ordered the zune dock and got this sierra wireless 595u cocking cradle usb station. i ordered it from Reagan Wireless i try to send it back and no ones there to answer and now its past fourteen days so i cant return it for my cash back. so be careful you might not actually get what you put your cash in to. but in stead something worth nothing at all.
1,WTF,"I was overjoyed to receive this product as it was going to help me organize my desk. I had all of the cables so I expected it to work flawlessly. But when I hooked it up, I was disappointed to find that it did not work...at all. It didn't charge or sync with my computer despite the fact that it had the correct software. I would not suggest buying this product based on my experience."
1,Don't use with later zunes,The 2nd generation ZUNE's don't fit very well. Buy the V2 for use with zune 80 & 120.
1,Complete Waste of Money,"If you buy it, you'll be spending forty bucks on a stand with no features that the Zune doesn't already provide (sync cable output, headphone jack, that's it). This might be worth buying if it came with speakers (you'd think Zune would want to provide accessories that compete with iPod instead of making the iPod look so much better!). I suppose if you want waste more money to buy the remote (sold separately), it might be worth paying twenty bucks for the dock, but definitely not forty or whatever discount Amazon might give."
1,It doesn't fit my Zune,"If I'd paid more for it, I would return it. Luckily, my husband is a ham radio operator with decades of experience building his own equipment. With time, he can modify the position of the connector, cut a larger slot in the casing to allow for the repositioned connector, and I will be able to use it.For now, I am using my cable connector to charge and sync to my computer.If you are considering buying this, I wouldn't advise the purchase."
4,ann touched on something that happens in real life,"it is very easy to choose friends and not realize they are using you or have an agenda, especially at a young, vulnerable age like stacey. Since stacey is not in the BSC at this point and misses baby sitting, she gets a job at the department store kids centre and enjoys it so much. But then her friends and her go to a concert and they snuck in alcohol and stacey was so shocked and couldn't believe it and I really felt for her after that whole fiasco and her mom was so understanding although she got grounded, thuogh I thought of it as more of a time to reflect on herself than a grounding. At the end she joins the BSC again cause she realizes that's where her heart is and she is so much better than the friends she was hanging out with and finds herself again :)"
2,Rather Disappointing,"I was always an avid fan of the Babysitter's Club, but right about when Stacey left, good books became harder to find. Instead of thoughtful, well developed characters, they became rather mindless and boring. The characters would change personalities in an instant or their bad personality traits would be accented to fit within a certain plot line. The plots themselves became trite. I could pick up a book in the store, read the back, and not have to bother purchasing it. I have basically stopped reading the books, of course I have gotten too old for them. However, I am bothered to see that my childhood favorite has dwindled off into this :-("
3,stacey and the bad girls,"in this book , you learn a lesson. stacey learns that you can't trust just anybody.The author forshadows that stacey's ''friends'' use her.First they persuade her to buy them clothes(ten percent off),then return them FULL price.Then at a U4ME concert,they snuck in liquor and blamed it on Stacey! ''hi crunchie!,'' A STRAGGLER. You can't trust everybody(especially that straggler!)"
4,Trying to help,"For those of you who aren't sure what this is, check out the additional pictures. This is an extra seat that attaches to the Ketrike Tricycle to allow for two children to ride the bike at one time. One child pedals and the other goes along for the ride! Hope this helps! Don't forget,you have to own the correct trike in order for this to work."
2,its small !,"we bought this for our air navigator so that our 4 yr old and 2 yr old could ride together, but the seat is so small! the seat even seems small for the 2 yr old compared to the air navigator seat. as pictured, this insert is the front seat for the person who has to pedal. so the stronger person gets a small seat. the only other issue i have is that my 4 yr old's knees hit the handlebars because you can't adjust the seat back very far (he's avg height to slightly above avg maybe). its a nice product but keep in mind the seat is really really small."
1,Not for all Kettrike bikes... be careful,"I purchased the Kettrike Air Happy bike and in the Amazon.com website, they state that the Kettrike Tandem Insert is an accesory of this bike. It is not. Even in the Manufacture's Information it states that it can be used with an adjustable Kettrike frame, one that separates in two. Well the Air Happy Kettrike separates in two and it does not fit. I'm sure, having the correct bike would make this item a 5 star toy. I guess not being able to return it because my 30 days are up has soured the situation. Good luck and be sure you purchase the correct bike."
1,safety,"Thanks to the reviews, I figured out how this seat was used.However, I doesn't look too safe. Where is the seat belt?"
5,I love the soundtrack!,"I really really love the P&P soundtrack. My favorite songs on it are 'Nothin' Wrong' and 'Be With You'. The whole reason I bought the CD is just that I'm a HUGE fan of Carmen Rasmusen! Well, actually I begged my mom for it [hehe :)]. But we thought it was worth it! Its a really good CD!!! You should but it!!!!"
3,Whoever Put This Album In Order Should Be Shot,"And probably was since the two studio albums that followed Cryptic Writings were in the correct order. Here's a hint: ""Trust"" is the closer, not ""fff."" It's too bad Marty Friedman for the most part sounds uninterested in this album since Nick Menza never sounded better and, while these songs are more derivative than Mustaine's other writings (cryptic or otherwise), they're still extremely solid. In most instances, what he's doing is better than what the people he's paraphrasing or quoting did originally. This album rates well below the three outstanding albums that preceded it but nevertheless deserves a spot in my collection and, hopefully, in yours, as well."
3,Overrated,"I was never a big fan of ""Cryptic Writings"" when it was first released in 1997. I thought it was an overrated album than, and I still think it is to this day. The album sounds like Dave Mustaine was trying to go for an even more mainstream-laced sound than on ""Youthanasia"", and hoping for Black Album-esque results. While ""Cryptic Writings"" is a solid album in it's own right, it's just too modern-rock sounding for my tastes. ""Trust"" is a fan favorite and rightfully so, while ""Almost Honest"", ""Use the Man"", and ""A Secret Place"" found Megadeth success. ""She-Wolf"" is a great track as well, but other than that there isn't anything special. Followed by ""Risk"" two years later, which is by far the worst album ever from the band. This remixed and remastered edition doesn't sound too different from the original, and the bonus tracks aren't anything special either."
1,About as heavy as the backstreet boys,"Isn't it ironic that every time MetallicA brings out a new album, megadeth isn't far behind? When the radio friendly ""Black"" album came out, mustaine & co. were quick to get in the studio & make a radio friendly album. When James started dabbling in country licks, mustaine hired a country player to ""teach"" him country, & had their next album produced by someone in the country industry. Every interview I read with mustaine, he can't keep from bringing up MetallicA. I'm sorry mustaine, but you have to learn that we don't care if you used to play with them, so give it up. Oh yeah, the album sucks."
1,Without a doubt their worst album,"I bought this album immediately when it came out, sparked by the previous two gems Youthanasia and Countdown. On the whole, this album is a huge disappointment. I went through once and never listened to it again. The guitars are noticeably weaker in timbre and in technicality, with Megadeth's familiar aggressive melodicism noticeably absent, sunken beneath a sea of awful mediocrity. The riffs are weak and the songs are tragically weaker. Vocally, Mustaine's characteristic sneering ferocity seems apathetic and distracted here, dragging the already ordinary, passionless songs into a miserable (un)musical muck. As much as I hate to say this about a band I revered for years, there's really not a memorable track on the album. For those Megadeth fans who swear by their previous albums, avoid this one like the plague."
5,Megadeth closes the distance on Metallica,"This is a killer CD if your into ""thinking mans metal"". If you want noise..listen to KORN, if you want pure pulse driving, grandma rattling, Mark McGuire homerun smashing metal..you have found it. The CD blends intricate soloing to all out blitz. From the Maidenisque..She-wolf to Trust, Dave and Company have closed the distance on Metallica. These guys are alos killer live. If you can get a ticket..do, they are awesome. And by the way, I am a Corporate VP for a large company. Execs gotta rock too!"
4,A really good metal CD,"Even though they went kind of mainstream with this album, it still is a great CD for Megadeth. It shows more of there artistic side, rather than pure raw carnage. Fans of the raw stuff can still enjoy it's sound. Songs like Use the Man and Trust well get you headbangin, metal heads. Despite being less raw, this album is still part of the metal millitia"
5,Megadeth is awesome...,"Megadeth is still a great metal band since they first startedout. i saw them live once, THEY ROCKED! This is some of the best90s music i have ever heard... Buy this cd. If you like it then you will definitely like their older stuff like rust in peace and so far, so good....."
2,This CD isn't that good!!,"I like Megadeth, but some of these songs are completly lame. If you want a good Megadeth CD check out ""Countdown"" or ""Rust in Piece."""
5,MEGADETHs coolest,"The only thing I could ask for is MORE. I like their longer songs, but their guitar riffs are juicy and they put their old works from KILLING... to shame. If they incorrporated more non-musical sounds and some more accoustics, maybe even a good instrumental, then they would easily take the world of music and bend it to their whims. CRYPTIC... has the cooler feel of the next century coupled with the Megadeth of old... Good job, DETH!!!"
4,Megadeth,"A decent CD from Megadeth, nothing special. Still, I'll take decent by Megadeth over awesome from motley (yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn) crew any day."
3,"A pedestrian effort, but an album thats worth the listen.","Lots of people forget about this album when mentioning the Megadeth catalog, and really, you can't blame them, the only album worse than this (thats not to say much really, still good) is Risk.Even though its not really attention grabbing, its still in the better era of Megadeth albums at least. Sonically however, it does provide a nice bridge from the massive attack of the solo-heavy Countdown to the mellow tuneage of Risk. A few more of the riff-o-rama style from the prior effort would have been nice, but might not have fit.I have heard the bonus tracks, and yeah...why?All that said, the album is worth getting definetly for the opening track, Trust, in addition to: Mastermind, Almost Honest, The Disintegrators, Sin, She-wolf, Vortex (which to me sounds like a throwback to Rust In Peace), and FFF, gotta have that song."
1,this album is bad,"Megadeth's latest offering leaves something to be desired. Their vain attempt at floydian rythms once again, ends in a draw. Not up to the standards of older albums such as ""Killing Is My Business...and Business is Good!"" Save the heartache and buy a Krokus album instead."
3,This is not Megadeths greatest work.,"Ok, all of you Megadeth fans know that Dave Mustaine used to be in My fav band Metallica, and yeah he was pretty good. But then he formed his own band which is Megadeth, and Megadeth is like Metallica. As the years go on there style of music has changed. And this is an album shows, Listen to this and then if you listen to an earlier album of them. It 'sounds"" different, and I think that its pretty good, so is this sound. So overall Cryptic Writing's is an ok album, its not horrible, and its not great, its just ok."
2,Overrated,"A very sub-par effort in my opinion. The guitar work doesn't seem that heavy to me, or creative. Thinking man's metal? I don't think so; see: she wolf. The lyrics just aren't that engaging. I own every 'deth album, and I'd rate this ahead of only KIMB (ded last) and (SFSG).There are a couple of good songs here; otherwise, not much more than a fountain of mediocrity"
2,Daves Singing Improved,"Not to say his singing is any good yet, but it is a little smoother on this album. the first song is good and that is it. The others bore me. Lyrically they're weak too. Buy some old metallica if you want good metal."
4,Good cd!,"This cd is simular to ""RISK"" but heavier. The lyrics are deep and good and the guitars are heavy but there is no good solos but that not a reason not to buy it."
4,More of a mainstream rock record than a metal one,"This is Megadeth's best record musically, but one of its least heavy.Beginning with the 1992 release Countdown to Extinction, Megadeth began a trend toward melody over metal, and Writings is its culmination. Chock full of accessible, mainstream rock/metal songs, the record disappointed some longtime fans despite its quality.That isn't to say there are no head-banging rockers to be found on the album. ""Mastermind,"" ""The Disintegrators"" and ""Vortex"" immediately come to mind. The latter features the best metal guitar riff Mustaine has written to date.The tracks that stand out the most, though, are catchy songs like ""Trust,"" the anti-heroin ""Use the Man,"" ""A Secret Place"" and the rather evil ""I'll Get Even."""
5,10 stars!,"yeah!. this is their best cd in my opinion it has all kind of megadeth songs from speed into melodic. 4 old school tracks she wolf,vortex,disintegrator and fff. fff and disintegrator are thrash! trust almost honest, secret place, have cool will travel and use the man are all great metal songs too. i'll get even is the mellowest on the album but still it is not a balladmastermind is awesome heavy track combine with a bit industrial sound , the bass line and the riff are really awesome.there's no weak track on this album. all of them 10/10this is wht made me got into megadeth"
4,"Good record, considering it was released in the 90's","After frustrating ""loadings"" and ""reloadings"", old school metal fans like me were afraid that"
5,Best mat ever!,"This is the best mat I have ever invested in! It's well worth the money. I have a cheap, thinner yoga mat & I wouldn't even consider using it any longer. It's like paper compared to this mat. Love it!"
3,Manduka Black Mat Pro,"It is comfortable and easy to clean. My biggest gripe is that it is so slippery! As a male, I sweat rather heavily when practicing yoga. I was unable to hold any of the poses that required stretching my legs and feet without slipping. After spending $80 on this mat I was not ready to spend another $50 on a yoga towel to cover it. So, I am putting my old cheaper Danskin mat over the Manduka mat to hold my poses. I have been told the Manduka mat will not be slippery when broken in so I am amend this review in time."
2,overpriced,i just realized there are so many things out there that serves the same purpose for less the price. it really serves its promise tho. this is good if you dont care about the $$$
2,Slippery when wet,"Well-reviewed, used by my teachers and more experienced fellow students, well-cushioned, generously sized, but sadly, I have returned it. It is most definitely not for someone who sweats as prodigiously as I."
5,fantastic yoga mat,This is the best of all yoga mats made. It will last forever and is well worth the money!
5,Awesome Mandudka,This 26 inches wide mat is a prefect size for my wide shoulders. Well made to last a lifetime of yoga workouts.
1,Dangerously Slippery,"I just received my Manduka Black Mat PRO and am extremely disappointed to find that despite the excellent reviews it received, this mat is so slippery that I cannot even hold downward facing dog without putting a dangerous amount of strain on my shoulders to futilely attempt my hands from sliding quickly forward.I understood before that the mat needed to be ""broken in,"" but I don't understand how I can practice on this mat every day for two months to do so without severely injuring myself.I have washed it and scrubbed it with salt, but I am still finding the mat far to dangerous to practice on. Really bad purchase."
4,"Great mat, shockingly heavy","The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the weight. It is kind of difficult for me to manage as someone who is 5'1"". Otherwise, it's a great mat: sticks to the floor, not slippery under hands and feet, does not stretch and a lifetime guarantee!"
3,Slippery When Sweat,"Hey im an avid yoga guy who wanted a high quality mat. i live far from stores so i had to use the internet to guide me. This mat appears to be awesome, and it is, except it is extremely slippery when wet. i sweat like a spring in a rain storm, and after minute five of my yoga the mat becomes a liability and even dangerous to use. i have to have a towel on top of it now. some reviews said that the slipperiness would wear off after a while, but its been two months and it is still slippery. once it wears off though it will be the perfect yoga mat, but until then its a slip and slide."
5,"REsponsive mat, worth cost","- REsponsive, bouyant quality a real bonusthis mat offers over most ""competition""- its thickness attests to the solidarityintended for its longevity and thoughtful-mindedness in engineering the plys- for myself, it actually helps me becomemore grounded when I practice- I made a deal to buy this with theintention to practice for a lifetimeto live up to an inner pact and testthe longevity of the product itself,plus to substantiate the higher costPROs- durability and lifetime guarantee- unmatched cushion for body to ground- construction logic pays for its higher costCONs- I would hope that someday the productwould feature more 'organic' materials andbear in mind a cradle-to-cradle approach"
3,Have great padding but not surface,"My Manduka mat provides great padding for my knees and arms. But its surface is bit slippery. It is difficult for me to hold many yoga poses, such as the dog pose."
3,it is slippery,"three stars for being well made, but knowing what I do now, I would not have bought this mat. Consider getting a cheap high density foam mat and putting a rubber mat on top of it. That would offer grip and support, whereas this mat is slippery despite three washings. I am also weary of the directions provided by Manduka for breaking in the mat, ie rubbing salt into it. Why would you want to purposely break down PVC and be exposed to the multitude of chemical additives inside it? Rubber has additives too, but nothing is as loaded as PVC."
2,I still slip...,"I purchased the Manduka black pro mat a couple months ago and have practiced/taught at least 100+ hours (primarily vinyasa flow) with the mat. I have naturally clammy, sweaty, moist hands at all times and I was hoping the Manduka would be a good solution to the constant slippage. Unfortunately after breaking it in and using the Vermont organic mat wash (recommended by Manduka) my hands still slip a lot and require a towel or yogitoes at all times. Evidentally, I'm purchasing the Jade Harmony mat as a replacement. I compared the Jade and Manduka side by side and my hands didn't slip as much on the Jade due to the spongy texture which grips better. Plus the Jade is all natural and biodegrades.Manduka Pros: great cushion, mat stays in place, dries quickly after being washed, good sizeManduka Cons: sweaty hands slip easy, not environmentally friendly, 7 lb weight if using as a travel mat"
3,Still slippery after washing and many uses...very heavy,"I bought this mat about one month ago, and have used it about 6 times. I washed it as suggested, with a brush and soap, and let it dry in the sun for 2 days. It still has the slippery film on it, despite all that and using it about 6 times. It is also quite heavy, and I do feel that I am carrying a roll of carpet to class! However, it is very durable, super-plush and I no longer have to use a blanket for yoga moves that involve being on my knees. I give this three stars because although my hands and feet continue to slide, I guess that it helps me work a little harder to hold my poses firmer and longer AND it is a very plush mat. I guess I need to scrub it down again!"
4,Manduka blackmat yoga,Nice feel and no slipping and enough padding. A very firm and long lasting mat. good for practice outside cleans easily.
5,Pleased,This product was exactly as described and was delivered quite promptly. I purchased it as a gift for my best friend and he loved it!
2,Super Slippery,"I wish I had read the reviews here, because all I did was research ""best yoga mat"" and everyone raved about Manduka. When I found it cheaper on Amazon, I just ordered it off the bat without reading further.The mat itself feels great, it is thick and very durable, and at first when I started to use it I thought it was going to be really great. Then we got into the flowy part of class and I warmed up (I don't sweat much at all), and suddenly my legs were sliding apart and I was almost in the splits doing triangle. Not good.I'm really disappointed and I hope they take it back. It would be perfect if it weren't slippery. And there is no way we should have to scrub and ""break in"" a yoga mat for three months, as the manufacturer suggests. That is bizarre marketing if you ask me. How 'bout they do all that before putting it out for sale?!"
2,ugh,"this mat is soooo overrated. i love the thickness, but it's super heavy and bulky to carry around. it also is extremely slippery. i get very frustrated when i have to use the 'dookie'."
5,great mat but don't buy frivolously,"It's heavier and bulkier but not impossible to manage. I don't mind the extra bulk, but I could see it being a pain for some.If you're just getting started with yoga, go with a cheaper mat. I had a $20 Target mat for well over a year before it started to crumble. Also, if you're doing a lot of hot classes with a towel over your mat, that will extend the life of a cheap mat. This is an investment piece and for those with a committed and dedicated practice it's valuable. But, I'd make sure yoga is something you're going to stick with before buying this.I am confident that this mat will be around for a long time. You can just tell by the thickness that this thing is tough. It even makes down dog more comfy.The only thing that I'm not absolutely loving is the ""break in"" process. I've been using it consistently for a few weeks now and it's still quite slick. I'm confident that this will get better as the coating wears off though."
3,Yoga Mat,I like the size and thickness very much. It is not a stickey mat. My hands and feet slide when in poses that I need it most! Down Dog...I thought this mat would be the answer to my problems:-(
5,Great Cushioning,"I wish I listened to recommendations I had been given and bought this mat prior to trying two other brands. I am using the mat for a cardio/plyometric workouts as well as for yoga. My knees need a little TLC and they are so much happier since I have been using this mat. I think this is a great option for at home, but it's a little heavy to be carting to classes on public transportation."
4,Excellent,"Perfect yoga mat. Some cushioning, but not too much. But on the heavy side if you are wanting to take it somewhere."
3,Not worth the money.,"This mat is certainly durable and has a lifetime guarantee. I have learned that I'd rather just buy a new mat rather than getting stuck with this one. I have had this mat for a couple of years and it is still slippery!! I have washed it many times. On top of that, it is soooo heavy. It's tiresome to carry anywhere, and forget about riding your bike with it. I even spoke with Manduka customer service and they told me various ways to clean the mat to make it lose its ""slippery coating"".... It hasn't helped. I really miss my Jade mat which was never slippery but did wear out after 1 yr... At this point, I'd rather by a new Jade every year than have this heavy slippery manduka for life."
2,Great size but nothing more to cover the extreme price!!,"The length is amazing on this mat as is the thickness of it but after all that there is nothing positive i can possibly say about it!!I also bought the matching MatWare Sleeve which i had to return since i ended up sending this back as well.I tried everything i read and heard about trying to ""break in"" a mat and to make it stop being slippery but nothing worked on this mat!!Extremely disappointed i am just glad that i was able to return it and get a refund before i broke or cracked a bone or something!!I would never buy again nor would i recommend it."
4,excellent but...,"This is a great mat, I really recommend it, but if you are from the ones that sweat too much, it's slippery with a lot of sweat! Still I love it because I mostly bought it because of the cushion. :)"
5,Great mat!,"Perfect mat! I use it for the infamous p90x and I wanted to be equipped with the best product available! It hasn't let me down, great condition and does well with sweat all over the mat! It is pricey, but it's well worth it IMO."
1,Disappointing,"My mother is the hardest person to buy presents for. However, she started to take yoga classes last year and really likes it! So, when Christmas came around I knew exactly what she would like- a yoga mat. I looked on Amazon and this mat seemed to have the best of everything- it's thick, long, and had great reviews. When I gave it to my mom, she was so excited. Her mood after yoga class was completely different however. She told me that she had the worst experience with this yoga mat. She couldn't hold her positions because she was slipping and sliding all over the place. We contacted the company to see why this was and they simply told us that the mat needed 6 months to be ""broken in"". In my opinion, you shouldn't have to put up with slipping and sliding for on a mat even if it is a new one. This was a definite disappointment!"
2,NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO SWEAT!!!,"Slippery!!! Be careful!!!I'm a Asthanga Vidyasa Yoga practicer and I sweat a lot during every practice. I bought the ""manduka blackmat pro"" to try ""the TajMahal of yoga mats"" thinking that it would be wonderful to practice with it. Unhappily, it's impossible to have a sweating practice because it slips a lot!! More than a regular mat. Do not buy it if you sweat! I'm so disappointed that I will return it."
5,Best Yoga Mat Ever,"Practicing yoga one or two times a day on hard wood floors on thinner mats causes my knees to hurt in some postures. The manduka blackmatpro mat is larger so other students don't set up too close to you, and it also is thicker, so no more knee pain!This mat is sticky enough for regular yoga; however, I practice hot yoga, so I still need a Yogitoes or similar towel to prevent slipping.People complain about the weight of this mat, which I agree is rather heavy compared to other mats, but if you can do yoga, you can carry this mat to and from your class."
4,still getting used to my mat...,"I have used this mat for a couple months, 3-4 times a week. I have found it to be stickier then my previous mats but still slip some since my hands sweat a bit... The other issue that I'm still getting used to is that my feet get tired/cramp during long standing/balance on one foot poses. Because the mat is thicker and softer/more cushioned (tho not too squishy) my feet are ""gripping"" differently. Of course, this is a great feature for any kneeling/floor poses. I'll continue to see all of this opens/changes my practice!"
4,Nice comfortable mat,This mat is very comfortable for yoga. I didn't think about how comfortable until the cool down stretches. It's comfortable while in corpse pose - plenty of cushion from the hard floor.I would recommend this to a friend.
5,"Large mat, great for home","This mat is large and thick, very comfortable and spacious to work on. It would be quite inconvenient to carry to a studio, but it's ideal for use at home. I highly recommend this product."
4,Great Mat - A Bit Pricey,"I bought this mat to go over my wood flooring so that I can do stretching and some other exercise routines. It's a GREAT mat. The surface is slip proof and I am able to exercise in my bare feet, which I really enjoy. I also use a Swiss Ball on it and the mat grips the ball nicely so it isn't slipping and sliding all around. I don't understand some of the lower ratings complaining about the surface being slippery - I NEVER experienced that problem. My ONLY complaint is the price. It's a bit expensive, but I'm glad I got it anyway - that's the ONLY reason I give it four stars and not five, is due to the price. Also, this mat is a bit too heavy for travel, so if you go to a yoga class or some other exercise class, you may want a lighter and less cumbersome mat. But for home use - it's GREAT. And BTW it DOESN""T SMELL like some other rubberized mats do. Buy it you'll like it."
4,Excellent Excercise Mat,"I don't do yoga but I do a lot of stretching along with some strength exercises I learned studying KungFu. I am a heavy build and muscular around 225. This mat is a good length for me, has just the right thickness and does not skid at all... highly recommended. In the end, it performed better than what I was expecting.The only reason it didn't get five stars is that there is an odor (that bothers my wife) that I am told will go away in time."
3,slippery,"The mat is really nice and thick BUT I am going to return it. Although, I washed it twice with soap, it still was very slippery for me. I could not even do the DownDog without slipping from my hands n feet. I ended up using the generic mats that the club provides.I have tried using this mat several times. I wish that I did not have this issue because this is really a good mat. There is no traction on the mat. For this kind of price, I expected this would not be a issue. I attend yoga classes 4 times a week and was looking to own a mat."
3,Half-roll backers beware!,"This mat sure as has a lot of hype! I've been a yoga student for over 7 yrs, but have recently switched to Pilates with a much more dedicated outlook/workout for the past 2, partly due to a recent (2yrs ago) diagnosed lower back issue. This mat appears to be great for yoga, but not nearly thick enough for Pilates. I got this mat hoping there was a happy medium, since I do on occasion still practice yoga at home and in the studio (minus any and all back extensions) So.....planted feet,rib open,extending yogi's you'll love it! Closed rib, hundred, half-roll backers beware!!"
3,"New, and not broken in","I got this mat in the mail last Friday. It seems like a nice quality mat, but this film on the top is really causing me to slip right now. I don't sweat profusely, but when my hands and feet stay in contact with the mat, a little sweat develops. I've tried to clean the film off twice - the second time with a pretty heavy-duty cleaner (diluted) and scouring brush.I'm really hoping to write back with a great follow-up, but so far this mat isn't working out well for me."
3,"IF YOUR YOGA WORKOUT IS INTENSE, DON'T BOTHER","After doing much online research and asking many people, I bought this mat on amazon. It's true the padding is great, and gives plenty of support. Like many have said, the mat is pretty heavy, but not a big deal. My biggest hangup is that it is super slippery and ridiculous if you are trying to do an intense vinyasa flow class. Because I read everyone's reviews about giving it time and just washing it, etc. I thought it'd change after time. It's been 3 months of me doing at least one yoga class a week, and I still have slippery issues! I don't feel like I sweat a lot, too. It's so distracting in a class, I can barely keep a downward dog. I just went onto the manduka website and it basically says ""a little slippage can be good for your practice"". What the?!I am returning this if I can. So disappointed."
2,I read this entire book in about 90 minutes.,"Easy reading, light fluff. Love developes very predictably between a private duty nurse and the angry bitter accident victim she is helping to overcome his physical handicap as well as his bad attitude. She causes conflict where there is none, fearing that she doesn't fit into the world he left behind after his accident and that once he walks again, he will leave her to return to that lifestyle. But the accident has shifted his priorities and her fears are unwarrented.Kind of disappointing for a Debbie Macomber book, which usually have more deeply developed characters and settings, as well as storylines. Not up to par with her more recent books."
4,A Soulful Sax Player,"Though little is known of Michael Lington among smooth jazz fans, this cd can be compared with any of the works by renowned artists like Dave Sanborn, Koz, Boney James and Chris Boti. Try the cd and you will like every song on it especially ""The Morning After"", ""l Sing My Song"" and his collaboration with Bobby Caldwell on ""Tell it like it is"". l bought the cd on experimental basis and l've never looked back."
2,Software for an invoiced based business only,"I purchased this product based on previous reviews and reading the back of the box. This product is not for the retail store. If your business is based on invoicing single customers for projects or jobs and parts used, then this is your product. If you have any other sort of need, then avoid this product. I was sadly dissapointed to find this out after I already purchased it. There is no way to reconsile the inventory if you don't track each sale by each item number and by each customer. Anyway, live and learn....."
1,MYOB doesn't rate,"I've used this program for several years and I have now reached the view that it has too many shortcomings to be considered seriously. It's search facilities are the worst of any program I have ever used, limiting searches to company or persons last name. It has major problems coping with GST in Australia especially with General Journal entries which it treats erratically (often saving them with tax reversed, and the entry unbalanced). BASlink (an australian feature) crashes the program. The program is also very slow in version 11. If you decide to edit information from a few months ago as each entry will take 30 seconds to open, 30 seconds to close. Scrolling logs is difficult because the window loses the entries.MYOB also has a bad record on upgrades, upgrading frequently for minor updates and charging full upgrade prices for all tax table updates. You are required to register the program (ie it is not an option). Bug fixes are called ""feature enhancements"" and charged for."
5,GREAT FOR SMALL BUSINESS!,"Not too complicated to learn.Even manufacturers can use it...you can take inventory and combine it to make ""new"" inventory. Nice feature NOT found in QuickBooks.You can even use this as a manual entry POS software for small biz checkout.Downloads or uploads text file spreadsheets.Much less expensive than oter MRP systems."
1,Mind your own money -- Spend it elsewhere!,"For the past year, I've wasted [lots of money] and countless hours on MYOB. Even my accountant couldn't figure out this overly complicated, user-unfriendly product! Having successfully completed only 6 entries and prepared 4 invoices in all of that time, I've since switched to Quicken. Now I achieve all the accounting activities without the angst. My only regret is that I was persuaded by some glowing accounts (by insiders?) of MYOB to purchase it in the first place. Only then did I learn that they offer unlimited consultation -- for a hefty price. No wonder! No way."
2,Not the best source for phonemic awareness activities,"Activities are not organized in a developmentally appropriate manner. Does not cover some of the most basic activities to develop awareness of speech sounds (e.g. listening, discriminating) and includes an abundance of activities that would be difficult for children at the pre-reading/early reading level."
1,Fire and/or chemical burn hazard,"Very scary product. I bought two of these for Christmas. One was for my son and the other for my neice. Like previous reviewers, the toy stopped working after a day. I changed the batteries (the old ones were a bit warm when I took them out). It worked for about 5 minutes with the new batteries, but then went dead. I checked to see if something had come loose and found the batteries to be quite hot. My husband said that with that type of heat the batteries could potentially leak... I bought them from Disney so I will be calling them on Monday, making a formal complaint and sending them back. They should not be selling this toy..."
4,Not ok.,"I have just finished The Fever. I feel guilt, and awe. I am smitten by the images of wealth I know and images of suffering and poverty I know. What are these sights? Has my original reaction, when I first saw them changed? Do I know how life works? Where are my ideals?This is a silent walk out of the theatre. That is, assuming I ever saw The Fever performed. Knowing Wallace Shawn as an actor I figure a flurry of humorous and bizarre moments would sustain my attention, because of his distinct personality, whether they were called for or not. But then a weight of truth and alienation. The Fever is not funny. But it is vividly alive, and if you think everything is okay, then it is dead. With The Fever, nothing is okay.A necessary piece of moving socio-political theatre."
4,Great old time Guitar CD!,"This is one of James Alan Shelton's many solo CD's he's released in recent years, this was his first instrumental CD, and one of the best. It has some great old traditional tunes, including an old Carter Family tune, Old Gospel Ship. And James also shows his songwriting talents with Twilight Swamp. And another highlight of this CD is a special guest visit from Dr. Ralph Stanley himself on Old Time Pickin', a great old time clawhammer banjo style song. If you like tradional bluegrass instrumentals, and great crosspicking, this is the CD for you!"
1,Not the 12 Year Aged,"I ordered this from Amazon and it was fulfilled by Olio2go. The bottle that came wasn't the 12 year aged vinegar. It was some cheap substitute instead that was runny and no better than the balsamic I can get at a convenience store. I don't know if the item is simply incorrectly stocked or if Olio2go is truly trying to pass off this terrible imitation for the real stuff, but order with caution."
1,This is ordinary grocery store vinegar,"I purchased this Balsamic Vinegar hoping that it would be similar in taste to D.O.C. qualty, 12 year old vinegars. I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase.."
4,Manicardi Aged Balsamic Vinegar #12,"I thought this was a fabulous product for the price. Great in salads, great on meat and vegetables . Well worth buying for your own pantry and would make a good gift as well."
1,Terrible for the price.,Be warned...this is NOT a nice aged balsamic. It tastes no different that Newman's Own or Safeway brand cheap balsamic - I was very disappointed and will not be purchasing again.
3,Good but not great.,This is not in the category of a great balsamic. I've been looking for a really good one that is not extra expensive. I can buy this quality for less at our local gourmet store.
3,Decent Aged Balsamic,Spend a few more bucks and get a higher quality aged balsamic. It was way too thin and had a bitter bite for an aged balsamic of this quality. Spend the extra bucks and get yourself a bottle of Rubio.
5,A must have!,"This is the best stuff on Earth! Not only does it feel and smell wonderful, its the only lip balm that has ever helped my chapped lips. A must have for winter!"
1,Disappointed!,"Unlike Carmex's containers, the lip balm inside Burt's tin container wasn't smooth or creamy. When I dipped my finger inside, chunks of the lip balm would come out, and I had to press it really hard against my lips to try to make it go on smoothly. Even then, I'd end up with chunks of it on my lips. It was just like they had gotten the chapstick out of the Burt's tube and pushed it into the tin. When it's in a tin you expect the balm to be softer so it can go on your fingers more smoothly and onto your lips. Maybe I just had bad luck and got a defected one, since I noticed all the other positive reviews this product has gotten. Overall, I was not at all satisfied with this product. It was a waste of the couple dollas I paid for it. I'd stick to the tube version of the Burt's, which I've been using and have been happy with."
1,not happy,"i heard so much about burt bees lip balm . so i thought i would give a try in this drying winter , but i was so hard to apply and doesn't moisturize at all .. i dunno if it's just the one i got or it's a bad product !! ,, anyways great delivery time (Y)"
5,The best,"I'm a lip balm junkie, and this is the best. I've been using it for years, and even though I've liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt's Bees. It's moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts. It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather. The mintiness is refreshing and soothing. I also like that it's all-natural, since I use a lot of chapstick and want to minimize chemical intake where I can.I've also tried the other flavors, and while they're generally good, nothing beats the original. I highly recommend it."
2,Didn't work for me,"I fully expected to love this product because I like mint-flavored balms and heard such good things about this one, but didn't find it all that moisturizing. It had a stiff texture and didn't glide onto my lips very well. Also, for some reason, this product actually made my lips drier than they were before. That kind of defeats the purpose of using chapstick in the first place. I have since found other chapsticks that are cheaper and more effective. I recommend Aquafina lip balm , which also contains beeswax but is a much softer chapstick with the added benefit of rich moisturizers like jojoba and almond oils."
1,"Not bad, but waaaaay to predictable...","This isn't horrible, but it's terribly predictable. This is punk pop that falls in linke with a lof of the others that seem to be following in the wake of Blink 182 (who, arguably, aren't terribly original, either) like Good Charlotte and Sum 41. The music is played well, but again it suffers from predictability... There's a lot of better stuff out there that is deserving of the notoriaty that this band is getting."
1,Make it stop,"I get to hear this stupid song every day at the gym. The singer sounds like the Del Taco Product Guy. Dumb band name, dumb song, dumb, dumb, dumb..."
1,Drunk and Stupid,"Look, I just saw these guys live, and no matter how good this CD might be, I would refuse to buy it. They were drunker than any performer has a right to be, they blathered about urination for 20 minutes, and they only managed to play about 7 songs in 2 hours. This is the kind of band that brings the art of music to a dead halt. Please turn your attention to some other band that actually has a) talent and b) respect for their audience."
2,I could listen to it if I was drunk.,"My god, I really liked the first single off this album, so I bought it. I have tried to listen to it many times, but I only get to song 8 before I have to change CD's. Its not that the songs suck. They just sound very similar, and there are annoying parts in every song. Like singing in Spanish, I didn't really understand the need for that, and the little children screaming. Maybe the last half of the CD is better than the first, but it wouldn't be too hard for it to be."
5,"Great ""Fat Guy"" Guitar Work","I didn't think they still made music like this. Punk with gorgeous dual guitar work.Girl All the Bad Guys Want is--incredible--in its own category. Catchy musical hook with clever lyrics. Out the Window isn't far behind.These guys rock, and are having fun at the same time. Great rock CD."
2,"just ok, not impressed","after buying, washing and using these pads, i am not that impressed. the soft flannel side seems like it will come apart, almost too fuzzy. i agree, i would not put a young infant on top of this. also, the plastic side is so plastic that my baby sweats as well and would not put her on this side either. so, i use it under the sheet to protect matress and is safer for baby. a young baby could get wrapped up in it accidentally if left on top of sheet for sleeping. i prefer Carter's lap pads. they are not quilted or fuzzy but, they are water proof with both sides made of 100% brushed cotton flannel. you can get them in all sizes big and small. i use them for everything from changing table, to crib and also for diaper changes. they wash great."
3,To Buy Or Not To Buy,"Well My aunt bought this item for my 2 two year old cosin,and personaly she and I loved it it didn't tear to easy and it acuatlly kept his mattress dry instead of leaking like we've found most due. So I'd really recomend this product and hey it's reasonably priced too."
2,Try it yourself,"I am still pregnant, but getting very close to delivery date. I am afraid of my water breaking, so everywhere I go I have a towel with me. For nighttime, I decided to use this pad to protect our mattress. I placed this pad on top of the mattress and then covered it with the two layers of cotton (mattress saver and bed sheet). I am pretty sure this pad is 100% waterproof, as it does not breeze at all. In the morning my husband and I both woke up sweaty in the areas that were on top of the pad. SO now I am not sure I want our child sleeping (and sweating) on top of this pad."
2,Pilled to be very ugly on first wash,"These are aweful looking and cheap-feeling. I may feel differently once I use them, but the vinyl or plastic side is thin and looks like ""leatherette."" The other side is some kind of polyester that shows significant stringy pilling on the first wash. Not my cup of tea. I'd never use these on top of the sheet. Way too ugly. I give it 2 stars only because it probably is waterproof, which is the main purpose."
2,NOT what I thought they would be.,"Be aware that I was not using this pad in a crib. I believe if I were to use it in a crib the same problems would arise.1, The back of the pad is a VERY SLIPPERY (but waterproof!)plastic backing. Unless the weight (baby/child) placed on it is great, it will move ANYWHERE and everywhere it's placed.2. The 'soft' side is not soft. It is a very acrylic like 'fleece' which when you rub your hand over it, it catches on your skin! Remember rubbing chapped hands on silk or nylon? It's much like that only your hands don't need to be chapped to catch on this stuff. I would NOT want to be in direct contact with this material.On the bright side, if this pad were placed under a fitted sheet of a baby's crib, I think it would be fine and dandy. Just make sure the fitted sheet stays in place and the baby is very young."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"I bought this 2-pack thinking it would be of high quality materials and it is not! I washed them first and then put one in my son's crib. After ONE DAY of use, it is all pilled up, and terrible looking! Really below standard. Waterproof pads are indispensable for our family as our son's diapers usually don't hold everything throughout the night. I wish I had looked further before buying these. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!! Choose another, believe me you'll be much better off."
2,didn't last long!,"I bought these to help with night time potty training accidents and have had a horrible time with them. In the beginning , they worked great but after washing them numerous times, I might as well not have put them on the bed. They leaked through and soaked the mattress. If you are not going to wash them frequently, then give them a try but if you need them for their intended purpose, keep looking!"
2,Okay...,"Well, it was okay. I mean the old books were 100 percent better. I'm not going to read it again along with Elizabeth. I just gave it a chance and found it was so- so."
3,Losing it badly,The Sweet Valley Twins diaries are a move into the new Sweet Valley JR high territory-one word for that-BORING! Its still kind of good though.
3,informative but hypermanic,"I've dabbled with the Power book of which this video is based. I was advised by a local instructor that if I could manage her Competent class then I should bypass the first DVD and buy this one. Whilst I would agree with the exercises being well presented and illustrated, their speed of uptake is far too fast. I have had to put this DVD on hold whilst I go back to my drawing board, and audio record the first two Sun Saluatations, to practice them at my own speed until I can ""jump hop skip"" with this DVD."
3,Blue steel,I am not sure what the title means for this movie. The first day on the job as a policeman and she has to kill a grocery store robber. That was the least of her worries. A pychopath steals the gun that was used in the robbery only to become obsessed with his heroine. Not a family movie and really not worth watching more than once. There is a lot of foul language and a whole scene of nudity.
2,Bigelow's Second Genre Movie,"Blue Steel is Katherine Bigelow's second Hollywood feature as a director, and it has many of the same consistency problems as her subsequent movies, great action, interesting characters, but a fumbled last act where everything turns to stupid.I'm anticpating the release on DVD of Blue Steel, however because it makes a great companion to the recent DVD of the cult movie ""Near Dark"", her debut. ""Near Dark"" is her take on a vampire movie (though vampires are never mentioned in the movie, and they don't have fangs). Blue Steel is Bigelow's werewolf movie, and is enjoyable on that level. I hope the DVD will have some of the detail the release of ""Near Dark"" had."
3,deceiving,been long time since ive seen this movie i rent it before buying it in dvd and i was desapointed i thought there was more action
1,IT HAS POSSIBILITIES...,"With fewer flashy visuals and a better-written script, this could have been one of the best films about the relationship between sex and power. As it stands, it's worth recommending only for Jamie Lee Curtis' magnificent portrayal of a woman (man?) on the edge."
4,Blue Steel,"This movie was pretty good considering how long ago it was made. If you are a Jamie Lee Curtis fan you will like this movie. It was suspenseful and kept you going as she was trying to defend herself from a admired predator. Just an ordinary man intrigued with what it was like to kill someone. She was a strong character, could this happen today, you betcha. I like all kinds of movies new and old. Do not like horror but I do love suspense. Give it a try you won't be sorry."
3,One of Jamie Lee's best performances,"Ok, the storyline's pretty weak and the characters aren't developed properly, but one thing is for sure: Jamie Lee's acting has improved in leaps and bounds. I found her quite convincing as a new recruit who has been suspended for shooting a guy whose weapon disappears after she's shot him.It's far from being the greatest film of the early 90's, but worth owning if you're a Jamie Lee Curtis fan. Go and watch ""The Fog"" after this, and you'll see what I mean about the improvement in her acting."
2,Cop out of Blue Steel unless you like Jamie Lee Curtis.,"Jamie Lee Curtis does a fantastic job playing a rookie cop, Megan, who kills a thief at a supermarket robbery during her first day on the job. Ron Silver has the best performance as the convincing, although almost over-the-top, power hungry stock broker, Eugene, who picks up a gun during the market robbery that Megan prevented. As any good psychopath would he becomes infatuated with Megan and goes around killing people with her name on the bullet casings. Too make matters worse he courts Megan and she falls for him.The rest of the film finds Megan working with her fellow men in blue to figure out who the mysterious killer could be during the day while getting her swerve on with Eugene during the evenings.The cinematography is good including some appropriate scenes shot in blue light. However, the characterization is fairly poor, especially for Eugene where very little of his background is revealed and the plot is quite predictable."
1,Don't waste time and money on this one!,"Stupid and ugly cast,dull boring script. I had to make a trailer of this movie in one of my class. Hated to work on it from start to end. One word describes it best: GARBAGE"
1,Incredibly Stupid Filmmaking,"Bad films continue to get made, but did anyone bother to read this ridiculous script? ""Blue Steel"" (1990) deserves a special niche in cinema history as one of the most implausible crime thrillers ever produced. The character motivations of rookie cop Jamie Lee Curtis and Wall Street psychopath Ron Silver defy logic even by B-movie standards. Director Kathryn Bigelow is so preoccupied with visual style that she ignores the astonishing stupidity that substitutes for so-called plot twists. Strangely enough, ""Blue Steel"" has a few cult admirers who remain charitably blind to its numerous flaws."
3,UHK,"I think this movie started out with promise, but just ended up being annoying in the end. Knowing that a psycho is after you why would you not check your place of residence and then sleep with your partner that same night? There were so many stupidities in this movie it sucked."
4,Gift,Brought it for friend as gift.Hope she enjoys it.This movie is a classic. Might consider buying the soundtrack. Enjoy it!
4,Muy Bien,"La película está en buenas condiciones, tal como lo especificaba el vendedor.Estoy contento de obtener un buen producto.Lo que no me gusta es que se tardó mas de una semana en llegar.:-(En cuanto a la película: Simplemente Fenomenal, Lo usé para un projecto escolar y todos los estudiantes estubieron muy interesasos en la vida, los logros, las barreras que Selena tovo que vencer y la tragica muerte de Selena.Selena: The Phenomenal Life and Tragic Death of the Tejano Music Queen"
5,WONDERFUL,"This is one of the best movies about an amazing person and her trip into fame and then her untimely, unnecessay, and sad death. A must watch movie for anuone who has a heart. Entertwined is also a beautiful love story."
2,Erdogans Review,"A good story was filmed very poorly, lighting of some scenes were terrible. Audio was not any better, some of the discussions were not audible, songs seems started in the middle ended before the end. AC3 5.1 at times was satisfactory but one could not make out the lyrics. I am sorry that I purchased this DVD."
5,Great condition; still sealed when received,"This was a childhood favorite movie of mine. I tried finding it at stores and they were not sold in my town, so I tried on Amazon. Great price and in perfect condition. Reminiscing was a delight!"
3,"Good movie, but there's a problem","I thought Selena was a good movie. It's very tragic that she died so young, she was on her way to superstardom. Jennifer Lopez did well in her part playing Selena, but there's some sort of problem. The true Selena was Mexican-American. Lopez is Puerto Rican. No offense to Jennifer Lopez, but I believe that a Mexican-American actress, not a Puerto Rican, should've played the role of Selena. Because of this, the movie was somewhat tainted."
5,This movie says it all!,"This movie explains alot on how Selena grew up, her tough times and how much people loved her.Jennifer Lopez does a great job playing the role of Selena.This movie is very amotional,about her death and how it has affected so many peoples lives.It is also about how she was so young when she passed on.I Loved this movie and hope you do too."
3,The greatest movie ever!!!,"You know I may only be 14 years old but let me tell you that this is the all time greatest film ever. I cried everytime I watch it. You people need to see it or buy it. Jennifer Lopez does and astonishing performance of the late tejana Selena. So take my advice and see the movie if you like it email me ,if not I'm sorry it took up your time."
4,Movie Hog,I loved it when it first came out...my youngest had never seen it so I got it ! I still love the movie and it will go great with my collection.
5,Awesome DVD!,"I loved the extra features on this, including interviews from the family and Chris. Plus, I found it interesting to see the deleted scenes that didn't make the original version."
3,Thanks VH1 for reminding me how good this movie is,"This movie was on VH1 ""Movies that Rock"" which made me think about it for the first time in like 10 years. The good thing about Selena is that it's a musical biopic that is actually about the music. At least 50% of the movie features musical performances, concerts, and recordings instead of spendning most of its time focused on Selena's murder and death. The film highlights her career as an artist, which I think is an important thing to keep at the forefront. Furthermore, whether you like J.Lo or not, I think it's important to recognize that she did a great job portraying this rising Tejano singer. She wasn't even J.Lo yet when the movie was filmed, and I still only knew her as a fly girl from In Living Color.The movie Selena tells a great story--though a sad one. Gregory Nava did a wonderful job of showcasing the life she led rather than her tragic end."
5,marks review,"I thoroughly enjoyed the product, it was exactly as advertized and shipped very quickly. I would highly recomend this product to anyone who is a devout Selena fan or who never knew her."
5,Selena is the best movie I have seen,"I recently saw ""Selena"", and think it is the best movie I've seen. I think somehow I could relate to Selena, with getting married with out permission, and doing her school work by mail. I wish I had known about her when she was alive! I will allways remember her in my heart, it is such a shame that she was murdered-what a terrible loss to the world and especially to her lovely family."
5,The best film I ever seen!,"I saw this movie while I was in my Español Class. I really like the music and how it brings life into the class. Her music is upbeat, live, and quick. The entire class used to dance to her music, in fact, I used her music for my final and it turned out great! I LOVE her music!!¡Vivíras Selena!"
5,Great Movie With Great Actors,"This movie was one of the best movies i've seen in a loong time. Selena's death was such a tragic one. The first time i saw this whole movie was in my Spanish class and I love Selena and her music now. Jennifer Lopez does a great job of portraying Selena. Her singing, dancing, looks and all...Lopez was obviously best for this role. The other people were also good in this movie. I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn more about Selena or who loves Latin music. Selena is where is at all started."
5,This is the best movie of all time!,I loved the movie Selena. It made you want to cry at the end but it also was happy in some part. Anyone who does not like this movie or does not like Selena herself is very wierd. Great movie!
5,This movie was great!,I think that the person who killed her should be punished for killing a young innocent girl who was trying to full fill her dreams. When she did make her dreams come true the girl shot her and her dreams were over and so was her life. I think that she should still be alive and achieving her goals.
4,J Lo does excellent impersonation. Good tribute.,"Fantastic story, great acting, and the music is good too. The storyline stayed true to the facts of Selena's life. Even the outfits are accurate to what Selena actually designed/wore. The only reason I didn't offer 5 stars is because there's a lot of singing and I personally like less. I understand of course, they based most of this film on Selena's music so it's fitting that they included so much. I just got a little bored sometimes."
4,SELENA's story well told!!,SELENA is the biographical movie of the ill-fated singer and her short life. Jennifer Lopez does an EXCELLENT job depicting the title character - and the supporting cast is wonderful.
4,Heartbreaking ending....,"I own this movie on VHS and decided to order it on DVD. It shows that even a poor family can succeed in life, if they are willing to work hard. LOVED the music in this movie.....cried through the tragic ending....dont want to give away too much though."
2,Wrong Product,I ordered the movie and received a dvd music video instead. Since it was a christmas present there was no time to send back and re-order. Thankfully I was able to locate a copy of the movie locally! I gave her both and things ended up ok.
5,lust for life,this movie brought tears to my eyes.Dad played by Olmos portrays the typical latin dad--I think we went to different schools together.The script is a romantic docudrama portraying the life of a talented young woman who should have been a superstar.JLO does a great job in this--perhaps it was her best role to date
2,it has moments,i believe selena would have been huge if she were still alive.this film doesn't really get into all of the depth of her.she worked really hard at what she did.Jennifer Lopez does a great job.that's the best singing she has ever done in her career.yeah Lip-Synching.it's a more complex story than what's presented.
4,Too Bad,"This is simply a wonderful film about a girl who could SING. One of the top Latin divas, Selena, is portrayed in here by a sad excuse for a super star, Jennifer Lopez. Lopez's acting is flat all the way through the film making it seem to last about 8 hours. to overcompensate for the inability to act, Lopez attempts desperately to OVERACT as someone else pointed out. The other actors are all right in their parts, but no one delivers an outstanding performance. The film has an overall atmosphere of a high school play that is horribly cast and put together at the last minute. It's a shame that the writers, directors, actors. etc. didn't spend a little more time on this film because it is a truly fascinating story based on the life of a truly fascinating person. I would recommend it simply because the storyline is interesting and the music is incredible (No thanks to Lopez.)Buy it today and I think you'll be remotely pleased."
1,DVD's Skip,I ordered 3 dvd's from amazon and all 3 of them skipped and got stuck and I had to restart them.
1,Anti-American Leftist Propaganda,"In the beginning of the movie, Selena's family fails at the restaurant business and they blame ""Reaganomics"". This is a cheap shot failed attempt at slander to discredit the greatest President in American history. Under President Reagan more small businesses succeeded and more wealth was created than any President before him. I don't know why Selena's family failed at business, but I do know that it had nothing to do with President Reagan.The producers of this movie are leftist anti-American scum and they are trying to spread revisionist history in this propaganda movie."
3,Not bad,"I felt this biography of the slain tejano singer was pretty good as well as the soundtrack, but overall pretty low budget and fit to have been a made for TV movie. The story follows well through selena's childhood on up to her rise in fame and tragically to her end. Jennifer Lopez acting debut perfomace is excellent and closely resembles the singers likeness on down to the way she fills out those stage outfits. The actors playing Selenas family memebers are mediocre, but what were they thinking when they cast the part of selenas boyfriend, the guy couldnt act to save his own life and he doesn't emote any type of emotion he almost sounded robotic throughout the film, maybe the guy really is that way in real life. Overall its a so-so bio, worth a rental."
1,Selena with Jennifer Lopez,The DVD was damaged and couldn't play the full DVD; many parts of the movie was damaged and unable to watch.
1,Dissatisfied customer,"I am a very dissatisfied customer. I ordered this product on 3/8/09, the money was removed from my account on 3/9/09 and to this date I still have not received the product that I had purchased."
1,"Really, really bad.","This is an extremely terrible movie. Overlong, overacted, heavy-handed, and corn in the extremes. The musical score is absolutely intolerable. Selena's songs aren't that bad, but that terribly annoying musical score almost drove me nuts. Avoid at all costs. Go watch a good biopic like Patton (1970) or Chaplin (1992)."
1,Great Music?,"This blows. Not the acting, but the music. You want to see a movie with better music? Rent Gimmie Shelter Or The Wall For A GOOD movie Experience."
5,I WANT TO BUY THIS FILM,THIS IS GREAT FILM I SAW IT ONCE ON SKY AND NEVER SAW IT AGAIN IVE TRYED TO BUY IT. THIS FILM IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY IN THE UK IF ANYONE HAS A COPY THE LIKE TO SELL PLEASE EMAIL ME..lordy35@hotmail.com
5,Powerful!,"I had heard of Selena prior to seeing this movie, but didn't know much about her. After seeing this movie, I can now say I am a big fan. This movie is one of the best biography movies I have seen. Jennifer Lopez excels in her potrayal of Selena. I was moved by Selena's love of her family, and her devotion to her fans. Her passion for music is an inspiration in itself. This is a must buy for all Selena Fans!"
5,"Her legacy lives on...,",This is one of my all time favorite movies. I began listening to Selena when I was 9 years old and I'm 28 now. I have played this movie for my children and now they hear her music and start to dance and clap and cheer. Selena will always live through her fans. Jennifer Lopez and Jon Seda did a wonderful job portraying Selena and Chris' love for each other.
5,great. great. GRRRREEEAAAAT!,The whole process of this order was simple easy and amazing. My product came the very next day! I was also in Mint condition. There was no problem with the CD play. Will definitely order from them again!
4,Good machine for basic use,"We were looking for a lightweight but fairly-capable machine to replace an old, heavy ""portable"". This Brother has a wide range of stitches, a needle threader, free-arm capability for sewing circular items and will sew several layers of fabric. This puts it a notch above some of the real cheap entry level machines. Some of the pieces, like the plastic panel over the bobbin, seem flimsy, but it should be OK if handled with proper care. The included case is really just a vinyl cover with a couple of pockets. You reach through the cover to grab the machine and carry it by its handle. All in all, I think it will work fine for our occasional mending, or a beginning machine etc. If you are seriously into sewing, you may want to go to check out some heavier-duty models."
5,brother sewing machine,it is a pleasure tohave a new machine that works. have not used much yet but love the features
3,difficult to empty dirt; got stuck,"The suction is excellent, just as what other people had said. However, there are a few things that I dislike.First, I need to store the low reach floor tool separately; acutally I need to reserve a spot on the floor just for it since I'd rather not put it on a shelf due to the dirt/dust on it.Second, it's very difficult for me to empty the dust/dirt/hair. It often got stuck in the ""core"" of the dust bin.Third, since the cover is opened downwards, when I close it, any dust/dirt/hair hanging near the opening tends to become ""sandwiched"" between the rim of the cover and the rim of the dust bin. It looks really gross, and in fact is very inhygienic."
5,Great Vacuum,"I purchased a reconditioned DC-14 low reach Dyson about a month ago for my wife. It arrived the same day as our new carpet was being installed, what planning!!. I have never written a review on any other item that I have purchased as I have always believed you do your research and buy accordingly. I can truly say that this vacuum has exceeded my expectations. I know they are not inexpensive but with this machine we got our money's worth. The service from Amazon was just great and our vacumm arrived about a week early."
2,A great price but some basic flaws.,"A nice looking product, but form should follow function....and it doesn't perform that well. Clock is somewhat difficult to read...darker than any other led clocks I own. Also, the radio is difficult if not impossible to tune. Most of my favorites come in mixed with another. Alarm works well however. And for $10 what was I expecting?So it went in the guest room. Let them complain."
3,Thoughtful journal,"I learned about this book from Vivian Swift (""When Wanderers Cease to Roam"" and ""Le Road Trip""). The illustrations are lovely and the trip's concept (retracing Reid's footsteps) and interesting one. Especially recommended for those who love Scotland."
4,great history if not sound quality,"The quality of this recording has never been great - I've owned the 8 track, vinyl and cassette and all were cringe worthy...but if you were lucky enough to see Leon's live show in the early 70's, this will ""take you there"".PS - saw Leon 2 or 3 years ago at the Dixie Theatre in Ruston, LA - there couldn't have been more than 150-200 people in attendance - Leon rocked - 50 years in, I'm proud to be from Louisiana, but embarrassed (for us)that one of the prophets of rock and roll couldn't draw a bigger crowd"
1,Cannot sing,"Of all the human beings who have put their voices lifted in song on tape or vinyl, Leon Russell is the only one who had absolutely no talent at all. He must have been a great public relations guy, because he can't sing a note. This album is so bad it's funny. It seems to be a satire."
2,Beware - Very Poor Sound Quality,"As much as I love Leon's music, I can't enjoy this due to the atrocious sound quality. I recommend getting the self-titled debut or the ""Shelter People"" instead. If you must have a live performance of Leon, buy George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh. Leon stole the show at that one."
2,"good music, bad sound","I'm a huge Leon fan, but the sound of this album literally gives me a headache. The ceaseless shriek of the women background singers is way too high up in the mix. It overpowers everything else. After the third song I'm running for the stereo to just make it stop. I absolutely love Leon's studio work and consider him one of the all time great songwriters but this thing is just nerve wracking."
4,great live CD,"Leon Russell is one of those white guys that have got soul. And his live stuff from the early 70's is the best Leon stuff to listen to. People don't realize what a true musical talent Leon is, any kind of music he plays, he plays great. This is a great, rocking, CD and if you like Leon Russell, you will love this CD."
2,Awful Sound Quality,I cannot even listen to this CD due to the sound quality. It completely takes away from the music. Shame.
3,not as good as i hoped,the lp tracks stand up so much better than sinatra's singles! too much sappy backing vocals.good price though $39.99
5,SOME VERY GREAT YEARS...PEAK SINATRA VOCALS!!!,Many of us baby boomers fell in love with the great voice of Frank Sinatra when we were kids in the 50's hearing adults around us playing his great lp's and listening to his wonderful Singles on the radio which is what this wonderous collection of Sinatra classics is all about so each great song was specially crafted for the radio to be a hit and many more than were should have been...this is an incredibly great collection of gems from the genius!!! Arrangements are first rate and this collection is a keeper from a peerless legend who continues to enrich our life in a way that only he could...thank you Mr. Sinatra for leaving us such a treasure chest of musical magic to enjoy over and over again and you are missed!!!
4,Oldie but a goodie,"This is an older cologne, but it smells good. I rate this up there with Halston z14. It's a classic scent and works well if you want to put a little on around the house or a pick-me-up anytime of the day. It's not as expensive and you don't worry about using it all the time. Try it for yourself or if your like me, come back to a great classic scent."
3,Fine product. Wrong size described.,"The only reason this gets a 3 star from me is the the demensions listed are incorrect. By a large margin. Try 4 x 3 x 2. Not 12 x 8 x 8. Other wise, fine product. I am still using what I ordered ( 4 total ) just having to use them all at once.... Will not order this again though."
1,A complete waste,"There is no plot. The actors can't act. And the women are fat or old or ugly or all three. The only cute one gets offed early in the film for no apparent reason. She's in a bikini in a hammock, bad dude walks up puts his hand over her mouth, bad dudette whips out a knife and rips her gut open. Why? No clue. When they get to the house, the first woman bad dude rapes could be his grandmother. Huh? As for the effects, I have two words: What effects? This film has no redeeming value. Period. My title says it all."
1,poor,This movie was so bad I couldn't bear to watch more than 10 minutes of it. It was a major disappointment and a waste of money to rent.
2,Very disappointed,I ordered this book back in November and have never received it. I have not been reimbursed for it either. Very disappointed in service.
5,Loved him in concert,"I had never heard of Dean James until last night when I saw him at the Houston Wine Festival and if this CD is anywhere near as good as that concert, it is fantastic. He is a master of the saxophone and his band is excellent. I and my friend were both mesmerized. We just laid back and took it all in. I will be buying this CD soon."
1,Buyer beware...,"I'm sure the product is fine. Or it had better be...I haven't even received this yet, but I have a review of the purchase experience. Had I known that ""standard shipping"" would be over $20 on this 2-lb, $29.99 purchase being sent to a local domestic address, I wouldn't have ordered it from Amazon, but simply driven to Target to buy it. To make matters worse, the things I ordered at the same time have already been shipped, but this is still ""being prepared for shipment""...and I can't cancel. Usually I notice these shenanigans, but this one got past me. So if you're living in the Arctic or on a desserted island 150 miles from your nearest Target Store and this is the one you want, go for it. Otherwise, buyer beware."
3,one year warranty,There is a fan inside the case and you have a one-year warranty... I would get the Studio II instead (five year as of this writing).
3,Not supported on servers,I had a 500gb version that works on a 2003 Server but can not be shared. I bought it because it is bigger and figure that I would make the call to customer support if it is giving trobule sharing. I called tech support and they said that server is not supported. The box says Windows 2000 and doesn't state professional or server which led me to believe that server was included.
2,Vista 64 bit not supported,I didn't discover until after purchasing the drive that WD has not certified any of their drives for 64 bit operating systems. I could not get the drivers to install and the drive wasn't recognized in My Computer. Since I bought this to run a mirror backup for photo editing I'll be sending it back and going another route.
2,I expected a lot more from this book,"I bought this book hoping that it would have some ideas for a prayer to recite at the reception or something to include in the vows, but I didn't find anything. Some of the passages are not timely to the 21st century. Like how a wife should be a subject to her husband. It is very small and I think a bride to be is better off with buying the NEW TESTAMENT if she wants something religious and inspirational."
4,Not quite Torture Garden...,"""Heretic"" is definitely a good record. It's represents a big change for Naked City, though, and if you're looking for another ""Torture Garden"" or even ""Naked City"" or ""Radio"", you won't find it here. This is more experimental, (at times) ambient, and definitely less structured and edgy than the previous Naked City releases. It seems to be a lot of lick-based noise where you have drums, keyboards, other percussion coming in and out, keyboards, other percussion, nothing planned out or even, shall we say, MUSICAL. Not to say it's a bad record, though, because it's definitely worth having, but don't go buying it hoping to get another ""Torture Garden"" fix, you'll only be disapointed in that case. There are absolutely no elements of grindcore, surf, or much of anything that made up Naked City's original mission, but do give it a chance, it will grow on you if nothing else."
1,Fond Memories,this brings back frond memories of the sounds of NYC Garbage trucks picking up trash in early mornings. You call this music. Belongs on NTV. (Noise TV)Is this guy a whacko or what--LOL
4,Solid How-To,"This Seloc manual is a great how-to, as good as other Selocs I've owned in the past for other engine/drive configurations. Gives good detailed repair instructions step-by-step to keep you on track. My only complaint (which can be said for all service manuals of this type I've reviewed) is that while the diagrams are very helpful, I could really use manufacturer part-numbers associated with the exploded-view parts... because after-all, the only reason to crack open a book like this is because you've got to fix/replace something."
3,Works Great - Kills Birds,"This product works great... you can see it killing the algae... but be sure to read the product label. That means the whole label - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS: Toxic to birds and bees. Not very useful in my pond, since I find both drinking from it. Works great on cleaning the driveway after a long winter... useless in my pond."
4,Clear water,"Seems to do a good job. Took a couple of weeks. Water seems to stay clear with weekly application. I would by again,"
3,Somewhat helpful,"This book is pretty helpful, but not all that thorough when it comes to my neighborhood, which is on the peninsula. It leaves out a lot of the activities that I and my fellow parents participate in, and is not really accuate or thorough with respect to preschools."
4,Helped me hit the ground running,"I got this book soon after relocating to San Francisco and it's been a lifesaver. Much of the beginning of the book isn't relevant to me since I gave birth elsewhere, but the rest has been extremely helpful - I've found classes, activities, facilities, resources, even an amazing sitter service that helped us avoid the dreaded search for a new sitter in a new city. It ONLY covers things that are highly recommended (it doesn't have a comprehensive list of every gymnastics program in the city, for example) and families in the South Bay or Peninsula will be disappointed (the title is a bit misleading - content is scant for those areas) but it's great resource for parents in SF or Marin."
4,"good suggestions, but everything highly rated is pricey!!!","Overall, this book is very informative. Especially for first time parents, I would highly recommend it. However, many (and perhaps all) of the highly rated items, agencies, people are also very expensive. It is not very helpful if you are looking for information on raising a baby in the bay area on any sort of budget. However, if money is no object, this book is for you."
3,Stupidity Rules,"A story is of students from different ""fraternities"" who were driving expensive cars in the Florida resort they made to from somewhere in Alaska and the least capable among them to seduce made it with an iconic girl all young males bet to do it first.Completely stupid movie."
2,"""Mauriat's Best ?","I was looking forward to receiving this album. Unfortunately the timeless classics ""Love Is Blue"" is not the original but an up tempo version and a lot of the other tunes are ""techno crap"" influenced. Why the heck doesn't it say NOT THE ORIGINAL recording.Extremely disappointing to me but probably manna from heaven for others."
5,Paul Mauriat always a pleasure,"I have loved listening to this CD ever since I got it and really appreciate some of his own pieces possibly better than more well know ones like ""Love is Blue"". He does a very nice version here. A very fine pianist, ""Nocturne"" is especially nice, as well as ""Etude in a new Form"" which I find delightful and energetic, as well as unpredictable in a pleasant way. Always professional, beautiful arrangements. I have always felt him to be under rated- Perhaps because he is ""From across the Pond""?, and because he is associated more with his popular releases, which aren't his best work to me."
1,10.2 IN LCD would give a great picture...if it worked!!!!!,"Was looking for a portable player for our 2 year old daughter (and of course us as well) to use on a trip to NY. Looked great, and for the price who would complain, more features then you can shake a stick at ($299.00 at Costco). Sold on the large screen and antishake feature. after 40 mintues, I finally figured out how to get this darn thing to play on our home TV, but the 10.2 monitor just doesn't work.If there is a secret to getting this thing to work, then Mintek needs to tell us; otherwise, the only secret Mintek is keeping is that you the consumer is getting ripped off if you buy this!Judging the other Mintek reviews out there, this is one of those companies that just can't deliver a quality product, or even a shoddy one...well heck even one that works!"
1,hip hop body bast dvd,"I purchase this Dance off inches dvd to do at home instead of going to the gym bacause of the description it gives about a whole body work out, but when I went to put the dvd it did not work at all. Press play n it said this function not accesible wtf!!"
5,Fabulously Fun!,This video is so much fun and can't wait until I master it. Great work out for cardio and toning!
1,"Not hip hop, not sure what this is...",This is the worst dance fitness video I have ever seen; the dance moves are embarrassingly hilarious. I think that a two minute search on YouTube would give you much better workout materiel. I regret having purchased this.
3,Firewall in the cold,"My only previous read of a McNabb novel was one with the same central character but later in his career and set in the heat of the Congo. This one is in Finland and Estonia and will get no prizes from the Estonian Tourist Board. Their country is grimly portrayed as dirty and corrupt. The story is of a British ex-S.A.S man, officially disgraced so prepared to freelance overseas, no questions asked. Kidnap, murder and demolition are all in his repertoire but underneath, a heart of gold. He needs money to privately treat the traumatised child of a former colleague murdered by the Provos. Full of action, twists, turns and great technical detail on arms and surveillance. The language was cleaner that the other volume I read. Not great but good for an escape from one's normal world."
3,Highly Descriptive,"This was my 6th book by McNab and I must say I had high expectations for Firewall even before reading other reviews on Amazon. Once again Nick gets involved in a mission that is similar to someone trying to hit the jackpot in the lottery with their last bit of money. Book reads about the same as his other fiction novels with most of the time being spent describing the intricate details of a plot that ends up disasterous. I do like the way McNab explains the way things work, but it gets a bit tedious. The part where he explains how to make a bomb, for example, became overwhelming and boring after 3 pages. On the plus side, it does add to the realism of his novels and lets the reader know that this guy knows his stuff."
5,Review PC-Cillin Internet Security Pack - 3 User,"I think PC-Cillin is great security protection for your computer, and I have more than one."
1,I would rate this 0 stars - DO NOT BUY THIS,"This program causes my computers to blue screen. Trend Micro has been contacted twice, but have not responded."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought PC-Cillin because it has 4 stars in Amazon rating, which is much better than McAfee and Norton. But I am wrong. Before installed PC-Cillin, everything is fine. But after installed, I can not access my yahoo email. After calling customer service two times, even uninstalled PC-Cillin, I still can not access yahoo email. Now I have to re-install Windows XP. It will cost me a lot of time. Anyone knows what wrong is?"
2,Dissapointing,"Area 7 are one of those bands that started off great but slowly faded away. SITMF is a huge step down from their first full length, Bitter & Twisted. The music is repetitive, the tunes dull. I would agree with the 'anthem' title give to Nobody Likes A Bogan but after a few listens to will wear thin on you. They began as pioneers of Aussie ska, one of the few bands on the Melbourne scene that got some main stream sucess.If you want some of their quality music go back to Bitter & Twisted and their EP's Road Rage and No Logic."
3,different at best?,"it seems most reviews want to describe this film in detail, for those who want a quick summary, i watched this when i saw ""john travolta"" as the star, along with Johansson, and as a big fan of Johnny,this is a movie and a role he should be pleased with, a touching drama, well acted by all, but a must see for any Travolta fan"
3,Worth an Evening,"I could be cantankerous and say that Scarlett Johansson is better in -- for starters -- Girl With a Pearl Earring and Match Point, that John Travolta moves through the movie as if on cruise control (great hair, though), and that Lawson Pines, the Gabriel Macht character, appears on the evidence of some readings in the movie from his work to be one of the least talented Southern sons to ever set pen to paper. Also, the movie's big secret (Lawson to Bobby, repeatedly and usually in a whisper, ""We've got to tell her."") is obvious to any viewer in the first five minutes. But, what makes Bobby worth an evening, is the two hour visit to New Orleans, the cast of fairly entertaining characters and the storyline, familiar and obvious though it may be. Hooray for New Orleans and hooray for family values. That's worth three stars."
3,A Love Song For Mediocre Movie Endings.,"PLOT: Purslane Will's (Johansson) mother has recently died. Purslane returns to her mother's home as the new owner but discovers two men, Bobby Long and Lawson Pines, living there. Within a few encounters, the three begin to bond and as Bobby divulges more and more insight into the life of Purslane's mother, they discover that there were indeed some things that all of them did not know about one another.Reasons you should watch:* Travolta and another humorous overacting job* Scarlett Johansson looking stunningly gorgeous* a fun little storyline that may or may not keep you engagedReasons not to watch:* characters you likely won't care about* a forced ending in which you wonder, ""What the heck just happened and why do I feel like they want me to cry right now?""* Travolta and another humorous overacting job"
1,Fell in Love with this Movie,"I have never reviewed anything before but this movie so enthralled me that I want to make sure more people see it. I'm buying the book it was based on plus the sound track. This is a movie where the setting and music play one of the characters and it is just wonderful! Other reviews have given the story, I just want to encourage people to see it and wish all the actors, etc. would have received more attention for their work in this movie."
3,"Great Performances, Meagre Script","Three low-life characters share a house in New Orleans after the mother of one of them dies. John Travolta is great as an alcoholic, overweight, burned-out ex-English prof who just wants to drink his life away after losing a child. His only joy in life is quoting famous authors. Scarlett Johansson is great as the daughter who never knew her mother, and has been drifting aimlessly waiting for something to happen. Gabriel Macht plays a would-be writer who is more interested in burning his manuscript than finishing it.Good points: Filmed on location in New Orleans, has the real flavor of the place. Good performances from everybody.Bad points: Not much of a story. Characters are frustratingly unambitious. Movie seems very long without much happening. Music was intrusively loud (couldn't hear dialog)."
2,This movie was just a little too long winded.,"I liked the outcome of the movie, the story was ok, but this movie was just way to slow. If it wasn't for John Travolta this movie would have been a complete flop. He manages to play his character well, and bring comic relief to a very dry movie. As a matter of fact, If it wasn't for john Travolta, I don't think anyone would be renting this movie. It is a dull, New Orleans based, broken family drama with hardly any memorable scenes. It is not something I would watch again, or care to sit through. A very boring, predictable red neck drama. I was torn between giving it 2 or 3 stars. To me, it was definitely not Travolta's best work."
2,Let's Hit Every Heart String and Nail Every Cliche!,"The dialogue that falls out of some talented actors' mouths is awful and expected. At times, I thought I was watching regional theather, without the charm. This film is watchable, but in a Mystery Science Theater way. Travolta picks some of the worst scripts written which is a shame because there are moments when he is utterly brillant as Bobby. It's a shame he's delivering such predictable drivel. Scarlett Johanson goes over the top a few times too many and rarely seems real. It seems like she picked the script for the number of scenes she had lines in. Still, glad to see a movie that doesn't have a car chase, an explosion or Vin Diesel."
3,Selective Hits,"This is a greatest hits package that moves me both ways.One the one hand,it is a comprehensive overview of Creedence Clearwater Revival's recording legacy.Besides the hits,they have added some excellent album tracks{COMMOTION,IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY,RAMBLE TAMBLE,the long version of I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE,BORN TO MOVE). However,the compilers have left out several hits (SWEET HITCH HIKER,SUZIE Q PART1[beats me why they include part2 of this track,but not part 1],RUN THROUGH THE JUNGLE,SOMEDAY NEVER COMES).Also, they include filler tracks(SAILOR'S LAMENT,FEELIN' BLUE ,NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME,LOOKING FOR A REASON ).It is not a bad compilation.but I advise you to buy Chronicle 1&2,and then this."
1,Complexity,"Complexity, because there is apparantly no easy way to inform you that the soundtrack 5x2 still has not arrived!!!!If your system acquires or allows another way of tracing the shipment please let me know. Otherwise, I am awaiting your reply soonest. Best regards, Gijs van Eck"
4,The Doctor's in,"I love it,i've been looking around for a real good carpet cleaner and i found it,this machine is worth every dime.it does a real good job on stained spots."
1,"Was shocked when mine arrived this morning, was dirty somewhat.","Was shocked when mine arrived this morning, was dirty somewhat. it looks as though it had been used? Dirty, YUCK"
2,Disappointed,"When I bought my carpet eight or ten years ago, it was the best carpet Home Depot had to offer. The carpet was in my bedroom and I live alone so it wasn't a high traffic area. I never cleaned it with anything more than a vacuum. When I finally rented a Rug Doctor, I guess it was too late. I made pass after pass going slower and slower each time but it simply would not come clean. So I certainly wasted my money on Rug Doctor. Maybe if I had used Rug Doctor after 1 or 2 years instead of 8 or 10 I would have gotten better results. I don't know. Anyway I am now ripping up the carpet."
3,Doors,"I am creating a project on doors around the world and I believed that this would be the perfect book. The photographs are beautiful but there is no text. I wish that there could have been specific details as to where the doors were geographically and a little pertinent history relating to their design etc. Also there could have been a lot more diversity with regard to country, color, age etc. In spite of this the book is still a delight to browse through."
1,Low concentration of active indgredient,"It's not mentioned in the product description but this product has a concentration of hypericin, the active chemical in St John's wort, of only 0.14%. Most St John's wort products have a concentration of 0.3%, and nearly all of the dosing guidelines I've found assume you're taking something standardized to 0.3%.Basically this means that if you take what should be an effective and safe dose of 900mg per day, you're getting less than half as much of the active ingredient as you might think. Except that I can't find any information on whether doubling the dose is safe, or if there are other factors to consider. Only Natural and Amazon are doing St John's wort users a major disservice by putting a non-standard product on the market with no warning or indication of the difference until the package arrives at your house."
4,Great Ballad,"I love this CD. There is a ballad on here called you are number one. My uncle played this and sang it to me not to long before he passed from cancer, so that song has sentimental value to me. You can never go wrong with the Whispers."
3,Always a fan,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights. I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's. It became just another DVD to the collection."
5,2006 Childrens Writers & illustrators Market,This is the second of this book I have purchased I currently have one from 2005. The book is very helpfull and it has alot of usefull information that I use almost on a daily bases. It has helped me so much I have currently sold 2 items that I designed to a childrens magazine and I hope to sell more in the future.Thank You!
5,Worth its weight in gold,"As a manager and chief instructor of a flight school, I found The Savvy Flight Instructor to be one of the best tools around to help instructors understand the real world of flight instruction - in particular handling customer relationships and creating a professional demeanor. I now ask each instructor applicant at our school for a ""book report"" on this book as a part of their employment interview, and we've made it required reading for our customer service people as well. This book is an absolute gem. I wish I'd read it when I became an instructor 22 years ago."
5,very satisfying,I bought this book along with The Nice Guys Guide to Getting Girls and I am more than satisfied with both. Both books are easy to read and very interesting. The Guinness Book of World Records has always been one of my favorites. I love looking up the crazy and amusing facts that just amaze me. This book can be read and enjoyed by all kinds of readers. The pictures and stories are great. I spent many hours just flipping through this book...you definitely can't go wrong with this book.
2,Overlooks facts in order to solidify it's own views.,"I bought this book on a whim after reading the back cover, which asks why heart disease and cancer are more prevelant today than they were 100 years ago. I was hoping for some scientifically and thologically supported arguments making a case.Unfortunately, they overlook the main reason for this fact. 100 years ago, our ability to understand and diagnose the many types of cancer and heart disease were limited. The last century has brought us everything from wonderful vaccines to artificial hearts.In short, this book overlooks obvious scientific knowledge and facts in order to try to reinforce a theological interpretation of poor health and well being."
2,Primera Scam,Primera uses a standard Lexmark cartridge and adds a barcode strip to the underneath side of the cartridge. I got caught one weekend with an urgent job and empty ink cartridges and of couarse local suppliers do not stock cartridges for Primera. I got tried of playing their game and bought a disc printer that uses standard off the shelf cartridges. No longer held hostage to their game.Chuck Hurn
1,Cartridges are poor quality,"i ordered four cartridges, two of which were defective and unuseable. The defective cartridges had very poor print quality and the colors were not vibrant. two of the cartridges were ok and worked well."
2,Primera Monopoly,The ink supplies for the Primera Printers are expensive and not widely distributed. I find that there are hints of a monopoly going on here and I'm concerned that their products are over-priced and their distributors are somewhat exclusive. Another misgiving is the continuous software updates which are pricey and rarely needed.
1,PRIMERA SUCKS!!!,"This is more a rant on the printer itself, but the ink is at least somewhat to blame. There seems to be ALWAYS some issue whenever I try printing. I've had enough of this garbage machine (Bravo SE). I'm already out about $1000 (including several ink cartridges and refill packs). I'll never buy a primera product again. Pay the extra few bucks to a cd duplicator service (Kunaki, Disc Makers) and save the hassle & headaches. The cartidges are insanely pricey ($50 for roughly 100 discs) and as far as the refill packs go, it's hit or miss when they'll crap out, and there's a ton of error messages every time that prevents me from finishing. Ultimately, I feel like I wasted my money, and will do EVERYTHING I CAN TO DISSUADE PATRONAGE!!!"
2,Bought four received one dud,These cartridges are exactly the same as Lexmark 35 but those wont work due to whatever Primera does to them. Unfortunately Primera does not seem to know how to do what they do :) properly as of the two I opened one says invalid cartridge. As it is not financially viable for me to return it I will use it in an old lexmark printer.
5,OUTSTANDING,"Ive read reviews here for years and have never been compelled to write one EVER. I cant wax lyrical about about much but I will say that, at the very least, even if you bought this album off the back of hearing just a snippet of one of these tunes, I promise you, you wont go wrong. Ive been searching for the holy grail as far as the perfect album is concerned and never really found it - but I have had this album in my car constantly since I bought it a few years ago, and whilst other cd's have come and gone, this one will not go away, and frankly, I wouldnt want it to. Its bright, bubbly, smooth but punchy when it has to be, and I cant think of a moment in the day when you wouldnt want to slip this on and it still hits the spot....remarkable."
4,More mellow grooves,"As the newest release from the star-studded label 18th Street Lounge, Thunderball gracefully maintains the label's aesthetic of impeccable downtempo. Exploiting the subtle nuances between breakbeat, dub, and drum'n'bass is what has garnered them a worldwide reputation as the true 'Ambassadors of Style.' ""Scorpio Rising"" plays like an ESL mixtape, from the drum'n'bass of the opener Heart of a Hustler with Curtis Mayfield-ish vocals; to the afro-beat groove of 'Sapphire', including vocal chants and syncopated horn stabs; to the bossa nova clave of 'Solar'. Their penchants for world travel as well as '70s action movies truly create a special atmosphere. Quite like the Thievery Corporation's debut, too."
1,typical,Time to get out of the basement jack. This is typical 90's groove wallpaper. Set the BPM and press play. 1 star for knowing who Curtis Mayfield was. Pass.
1,Buyer beware when going thru Amazon's 3rd party sellers,"This cassette was a gift for my aunt because she likes to go walking and doesnt have a portable cd player. The cassette does not play correctly, and is obviously used and damaged. It somewhat works on her larger stereo console, but is still not correct.Wasted my money goin through a 3rd party Amazon seller."
1,Caveat emptor!,"The attribution of one of the works on this issue to Wilhelm Furtwaengler is spurious. According to John Hunt's authoritative discography, ""there is no evidence that WF ever conducted Grieg's Piano Concerto."" The performance at hand may be a wartime collaboration between pianist Walter Gieseking and conductor Robert Heger, but even that is uncertain."
2,Deceptive title,"From title I thought would see some great photography from an airplane or balloon. Instead you get a French environmental film spoken in French with English subtitles. I watch many environmental films, but David Attenborough is much, much better than this series."
3,Good - but quite old,"Despite this book's listing as 1991, it is actually a 2002 printing of a book first published in 1971. For Keene fans, and those wishing to delve a bit deeper into Japanese culture this book would be a good addition to your collection.It is a collection of articles. They are well written and broadly ranging. My favorite is an article called _Confessions of a Specialist_ which originally appeared in the New York Times. In it, Keene describes his emotions as his colleagues roll their eyes and wonder why he's still translating dusty old Japanese scrolls.Well, now its 2003 and Keene is still at it.But this, his early work, has been eclipsed by his subsequent ouptput. At any rate, don't be fooled into thinking this consists of his recent writings."
4,The best of two,"This was Cressida's second and last album, and the best one. The starting line ""Lunatic Larry beating his head on the wall"" fits well in with the title of the album, ""Asylum"". It's got a couple of longer tracks than the debut and sounds a bit more mature. Still a pleasent group to listen to, without too many ""turn-arounds"" in rhythm like too many bands loved to do at this time. For Uriah Heep fanatics: Iain Clark, the drummer is the same as on ""Look At Yourself"" He plays on both Cressida albums."
4,interesting early 70 s progressive band,One of the band signed by Phillips asylum . Early 70 s progressive mixing up everything with a particular taste of Jazz . piano player & singer very interesting
3,Very simplistic game,"This game was not at all challenging for my five year old daughter. She got through it in under an hour,and in under twenty minutes the second and last time she played it. It is probably more suited to 3-4 year old children, depending on their computer skills.On the plus side the graphics are nice."
5,Super for kids 2 - 4,"I hadn't noticed this game because I find most Disney software to be lesser quality than several other brands; but then I read that Disney contracted Hulabee to design this program and I immediately purchased it. My four-year-old daughter who is an avid educational game player loved it. She finished it in less than an hour. The graphics are excellent; the game's design is Hulabee quality--both engaging and rich in problem solving education. The only problem was it was too easy for my girl. I recommend it for ages 2-4. However, despite it being too easy, by daughter continues to play it. It's a hit!"
4,Wish they came finished,"The handles are well constructed and I like the heavy in hand feel. Maybe I'm asking too much for a $300 set of knives, but they could use a little more attention on the edges. I guess we disagree on what is considered ""precision honed."""
5,"New, Fun and Exciting",Bob is adorable. He is a cute and curious penguin with the motivation to never give up.
1,...,"Tuttle Publishing has published some good books on martial arts. I really liked their, Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere. And The Secrets of the Samurai, both by the same authors. Their work appears to me to be quite meticulous and well researched and really beautiful. Stunning. Never mind that I think Aikido is nearly useless in the street, these are thoughtful books. But I am left wondering, whether or not Tuttle has a peer review procedure for books claiming to be anthropologically valuable. They should, that way [stuff] like this wouldn't get published. Mark Wiley is a martial artist who, really gets on my nerves. I am glad I only borrowed this book from a friend, and that he is the one stuck with it!"
3,Filipino Martial Arts Culture and History.,"The book is very well put together. BUT it is not for casual reading or light reading. Very detailed in History, Concepts, Masters, Styles and origins. I would describe it as assgined reading is Anthropology 102 or World Culture 101 at Berkely. A little one sided in that is favors certain masters and styles. But with a Martial Art as vast as the FIlipino Martial Culture ther may be no other way."
4,cool stuff...,"I think the smoking popes are a very good band. Destination Failure is a good CD. ""pretty pathetic"" is and always will be one of my favorite songs. ""Star Struck One"" is also very good. I like how the smoking popes have their own style and they sing from the heart. This cd is definately worth the money."
4,Great stuff,"Smoking Popes are a solid band, I do not think they will ever reach super stardom, but their romantic keep me entertained for the time being."
3,"""...close Ward, very close...""","sure, they've got a great sound down! but, there's only two songs that really stand out (""no more smiles"" ""pure imagination"") -and guess what? those are the two that the Smoking Popes -didn't- write. to be fair, it's still better than half the stuff out there, but..."
2,Go for their earlier stuff!!!!!!!!,"The smoking popes is an A1 band. If you are in to the poppier side of punk definetly check them out. Destination Failure is the popes's worst release in my opinion, they even managed to ruin some of their classics on this one. Get Fired Up is a must for any punk, but steer clear of Destination Failure. I give it two stars only on the strength of the Smoking Popes earlier work. THIS ALBLUM IS THE ONLY THING I SEE THAT IS DESTINED TO FAIL."
4,Finally a pop-punk band that doesn't sound like pop-punk.,"While other pop-punk bands (i.e. Blink 182, Sum 41, and countless others whose names I forget, but likely end with numbers) seem to get stuck in a rut trying hard to sound like a pop punk band, the Popes simply take the aesthetic of pop-punk and play what they want to play. The chord progressions contain more than 4 chords a song, the instrumentation isn't always bashing you in the face, and the singer doesn't sound like some whiney Joey Ramone or Johnny Rotten sound-alike. Most of all, their songs are interesting and fun, but not just for the sake of being interesting and fun. They're just good songs. (Not to mention ""Pure Imagination"" is possibly the best cover I've ever heard)Let's hear it for the Smoking Popes."
5,One of the best albums of the 90's,"The Smoking Popes blend heatfelt lyrics and melodies of love, love, oh yeah and more love into 3 minute pop songs that will make you want to cry. Destination Failure is an incredible cd and is one of the best cds of the 90's yet it still is not one of the Popes finest. This cd is highly recommend to any music fan and if you like this cd be sure to check out ""Get Fired"" and ""Born To Quit."" Please do your self a favor and listen to the Smoking Popes."
4,Destination Failure,Destination Failure is anything but. It's a great cd to have in your collection. Wonderful to listen to in the car. I enjoyed this album very much. One reason being it doesn't sound like a lot of other bands out there. Something new and fun!
4,Yummy Indian Delight Ready in Minutes Hot & Steamy,"I like it so well I've subscribed to it in Amazon Groceries to be delivered regularly. Makes a great side dish, lowfat, warm, nutritious, & delicious. Extremely spicy (which I love) but a warning to those who cannot handle very hot spices. I always serve it as a side dish but it could also be a meal. After dinner or with dinner, eat some yogurt to dull down the spicy/hot afterburn. Simply place the bag in boiling water for 5 minutes, cut open packet, & serve. No weird metallic tastes from packaging...you only taste the food. Yummy! I also like Tasty Bites similar products but this is just as good for about the same pricing. If you like Spinach and/or Indian food, you will love it!"
3,"Great ring, just don't wear it when you fly!","I was wearing my nice, new marijuana leaf ring when I flew into Jacksonville recently...for 'some reason' my luggage was chosen to be searched. That costs me a 40 minute wait for my luggage to appear on the turnstile, a trip to the office to report my stuff 'lost' and a nice 4 hour delay when the security boys ripped into my bags like weasels tearing into a cupcake! The bag finally arrived at my Hotel room with a broken latch, minus my binoculars...[I wonder what they found--Or, if they just liked my binocs?]. So, lesson learned; wear this ring in appropriate venues only!"
4,Greatly underrated film,"Those who choose to review don't seem to ""get"" this film. Sinatra is able to portray the character of a realistically strong, dedicated, and loving man. He is one of the few actors who could pull it off. Sinatra is both believable and fascinating in his role as an exceptional police investigator with a palpable off-beat manliness who maintains his allegiance to his chosen duty while suffering the great tradgedy of his own personal life."
1,Warner Bros Re-Issues Film but still Pan/Scan!,Warner Bros decided to reissue this film and it is still Pan/Scan! We still don't have a Widescreen version of this film! I guess this one is one for the bargin bins of Wal-Mart!
3,FirstDeadlySin,"Not even close to be as good as the book, which The Crown Crime Companion rates as the 52nd BEST mystery novel of all time.Given that, the movie was pretty darned good. Sinatra was excellent, as was Faye Dunaway in a marvelously subdued role. The movies story, while substantially different than the book, still contained all of the elements from Lawrence Sanders excellent novel.I can see where the script writers would have had a most difficult task making a movie tell the story as Sanders told it. Given that, the script writers did keep all of the suspense.In my judgment, that and Sinatra's performance gives it 4 stars out of 5."
2,Deadly is Right,"Sinatra's last starring role in an adaptation of Lawrence Sanders' landmark novel holds some nostalgic sway over some of us, but all in all simply isn't very good. Frank has some effective moments and there's about 20 minutes of good cat-and-mouse with the killer towards the end, but otherwise everything's pretty tame and dull. The labored and drawn-out scenes of Faye on her deathbed aren't bad enough to be camp, but they come pretty close. Additionally, the lame full-screen presentation on this DVD makes this look more like a TV movie than a feature."
2,Sinatra should have been Dirty Harry,"Sinatra was almost picked to be Dirty Harry instead of Clint Eastwood. If he had then he wouldn't have been doing movies like this semi-bomb. However, it's worth a look to see Sinatra's last flick. Not too terribly bad."
3,Great to see Frank one final time.....,"While it is wonderful to see Sinatra in his final motion picture, the film could have been much better. It has fleeting moments of strength and interest, but all in all, it appears flat and tired. Those audiences used to thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate, Suddenly, Man With the Golden Arm, or even today's entries such as SEVEN, will find this film slow and boring. Of course, Sinatra fans will find it worthwhile nevertheless, and it is in this aspect that I recommend it."
3,Formula stuff ... but it is Sinatra,"On a par with a good TV movie but nothing special, which is unfortunate for Sinatra's last significant film role. Sinatra, though, is as compelling as always on screen and the film is worth viewing, if not one you'll want to revisit often."
3,For the collectors of Tchaikovsky's operas,"I bought this DVD for the sentimental reasons only. I was raised in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia, where this performance was staged and filmed (not in Moscow, as the annotation to the DVD states). I saw this production in this theater with these singers 25 or 30 years ago. And on this DVD I see even familiar faces in the audience at the end.As for the quality of the performance - I rate is as decent. All main singers are OK, except Prince Yuri - Vadim Balyuta (not ""Valyuta"", as on the DVD cover - ""valyuta"" is a Russian word for ""hard currency""). I'm not sure if it is worth to perform this opera with the first-rate singers in the first-rate theater, because the opera itself is so second-rate. This DVD could be recommended for those who want to have video recordings of as many Tchaikovsky's operas as possible."
2,Not that interesting,"Unless you are a Tschaikovsky opera fanatic this is an opera to skip. I had no prior exposure to this work. I found it conceptually uniteresting and hard to get into. From a production point of view the DVD is fine. It was recorded live in 1984. The colors are reasonable; the clarity of images are very good. The sound was also reasonable. The staging seems very traditional and fairly static. I thought that all of the performers sounded fine. This DVD will go on a shelf with my other 400 opera DVDs, but it is unlikely I will watch it again."
1,Watch out!,"This dvd (as sold on Amazon Marketplace) has been heavily edited down to a 'G' rating from the original version.(the original version is great, however that's not what I got)The box says 'NR' for Not Rated, also that it was manufactured in the People's Republic of China. Did I wind up with a bootleg?"
1,Bootleg DVDs are everywhere,"I have tried twice now to purchase the 90 minute DVD, R-rated, released by Bell Canyon, and both times have been sent the heavily edited (75 minute) NR pan-and-scan bootleg produced in China (by some entity calling itself Digiview Entertainment). It doesn't seem to matter which of the various Amazon pages you order from, or that the product is described as the 90-minute original. Seems as if a lot of vendors don't know about or care about the difference.I wish Amazon would be more scrupulous about getting vendors to sell exactly what they advertise, and linking up to the proper page.At any rate, beware if you order a DVD of this excellent film. Getting a real one seems to be quite like buying a ticket for the lottery..."
5,A superb plot that examines the psyche of four people,"This film was adapted from a play. It explores the psyche of four people, two men and two women, a married couple and a couple living together without marriage. The second couple visits the first, and the husband of the married couple finds that $50 is missing from his wallet. He and his wife search the clothing of the woman visitor and find a $50 bill, which they take. The visiting woman discovers that a $50 bill was taken from her wallet. Then the plot accelerates. A subsidiary plot is that the visiting woman found two lines from a piece of music by Schuman in a piece of music composed years earlier by another composer. How did it get there? Still complicating the plot is that both men are attracted to the females of the other couple. The play and the movie received well-deserved plaudits for both the acting and the story."
4,"Hey, I liked it.","It was a pretty good film full of twists and turns. There is this coupple and the womans ex-boyfriend comes to visit and brings his new girlfriend along. The the coupple think that the ex-boyfriend's girlfriend stolled money from the man's wallet and it just goes on with accuzations and miss judgements. The ending, for me was slightly unclear but mabey I just didn't notice some key elements. It had really good acting and I enjoyed this movie. I kept me on the edge of my seat."
4,Bad Manners - Good Movie,"I saw this at the Chicago Film Festival a few years back. I am very happy to see that this movie is finally available on video. This was hailed as an updated ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" It's really not the same, but great just the same. The small cast is awesome here. This is available on DVD as well, just not here (yet)."
3,Just OK,I was expecting a little more for the money...was a bit cheap looking with a lot of flimsy plastic parts.
1,Bali panties,"I,ve worn these for years and need to order more. They wear better than any others I,ve puchased and will order more."
3,"Nice, but too loose.","I ordered the size I usually wear, but these are too large; however, I will keep them in case I put on some weight :)"
3,disapointed,"fabric is great, fits well in the hip area, but too long for the front of my legs. I have to keep pulling them up and they are not very confortable. i will not be buying any more."
1,bali women's freedom panty,Inferior quality. It does not run true to size. The size 6 I ordered was quite huge. I feel like I wasted my money. I do not recommend it.
5,bali freeform panty,The most comfortable panties ive ever owned. they move with you and fit beautifully.The size is perfect. the material is very nice.
3,Comic adaptation of the video game,"The basic story is simple enough. The eco-warriors are led by a beautiful woman who has some telepathic contact with the planet's most dangerous creatures. (Of course, they're not so bad once you get to know them.) They defend the world against the rapacious invaders, whose attack ships are ""quick, deadly, and they waste fuel."" Wow. What a stunning indictment of the army that's blowing your home to rubble with you in it.The artwork - the reason I picked this up - is generally attractive airbrush work. Female figures (clad, if it matters) are drawn with affection. Airbrush makes some problems very easy, though, and the problems are apparent here. Way too many edges turn fuzzy, and people's skin often takes a waxy look.It's a quick, enjoyable read, but ultimately forgettable.//wiredweird"
3,Good but it had flaws,I have been basically addicted to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire for a long time. So I felt this would be very exciting. Only problem is there were some flaws. Some of the game's highest technology was used in the very first part of the post-Planetfall years. And charcters said uhmm to much. Other than that it was pretty good. I want more. But I think there should be more factions included.
5,SPECTACULAR!!!,"I'm not sure how it could be better. It is big and heavy to move, but that means it doesn't tip or get knocked around by the kids or the cats. The lights work perfectly and they send a lot of extras. My whole family was impressed. I think the 9 ft measurment is before the stand though so be careful of that."
1,DANGEROUS PRODUCT: FIRE HAZARD,"THIS REVIEW IS ADDRESSED TO AMAZON OR MANUFACTURER OF THIS CHRISTMAS TREE.THE TREE IS OF GOOD SIZE AND I LIKE ITS LOOKS. HOWEVER, THE REMOTE ONLY OCCASIONALLY WORKED FROM THE BEGINNING AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO TURN ON THE LIGHTS FROM THE MAIN WALL SWITCH. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF SMELLING SOMETHING BURNING, WE FINALLY TRACKED IT DOWN TO THE REMOTE BOX OF THE TREE. THE REMOTE BOX WAS ACTUALLY BURNING. I PAID $653.24 + MY REWARDS FOR THIS TREE. I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT.I CAN EMAIL YOU A PICTURE OF THE BURNT REMOTE BOX.CORAZON C. AGO"
1,Disappointing adaptation,"I've seen plenty of movies that stayed true to the spirit of the book, while condensing or omitting certain scenes/subplots. After all, a picture can be worth a thousand words and the photography in this film is great! This version of Heidi doesn't do that. It left me feeling frustrated and annoyed at the characters. Not at all the feeling I had as a kid after reading the book. Which is what I recommend: read the book instead."
5,A delilghtful Heidi.,"Patricia Neal's performance alone would be worth the price of the DVD! However, all of the actors did a wonderful job. The child playing the title role is charming, and Jason Robards does a splendid job portraying the crusty old grandfather. Of course, the scenery is stunning, and the score reinforces the themes of the movie. If Heidi's miraculous rescue from the raging torrent seems a bit contrived, the rest of the film makes up for it with a fairly realistic portrayal of life in the remote Alpine valleys of Nineteenth Century Switzerland."
4,edited for video,"On commercial free television, this movie runs in two parts with a total runtime of over 3 hours. The video version of the movie has about 20 minutes cut out of the original presentation. Some really sweet nuances have been removed.This is an enjoyable movie in either case, or course, but let's hope that Disney releases an unedited version to DVD soon! I would love to add it to my collection."
2,Not enough product for the price!,"I've collected most of Loreena McKennitt's CDs. I think she is a true talent. The quality of these songs are equal to any other CD Ms. McKennitt has put out...TOP NOTCH! The problem: NOT ENOUGH! There are only 22 1/2 minutes of Loreena's beautiful voice, which is about 1/3 of the maximum space on a CD. I don't feel I got my money's worth."
4,beautiful!,"The only reason I gave this item ""4 stars"" is because it only has the 5 songs on it - I wish it had more. However, it's still worth buying. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, in McKennitt's signature style. If you enjoy her music, this album won't disappoint. I recommend it! :-)"
4,Blasphemous!,God rest Ye merry Gentlemen for bellydancing? A Winter Garden is a Christmas album that would hardly suit a well known tranquil mood of that season. A star less only because it's too short.... And may all your Christmases be hot!
4,a winter garden,I love Loreena McKennitts' music. this CD is very melodic in a Celtic way. the music on this CD is also very mellow listening. I love the rhythms of the instruments used.
5,"Three Hair-raising albums to review, and this is one!!!","Bluntly put, this is one of the three most stunning Christmas albums known to man. ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" combines a Middle Eastern instrumentation with Celtic... (play it before service in your church and they won't be talking about the lecture...), and ""Good King Winceslas"" is just out and out powerful! Short CD, but worth twice the money!HOWEVER...There's only ONE other group which has a Christmas album which can hang with this one every step of the way (and it ain't Enya I'm talking about), and that's Gypsy Soul (gypsysoul - com), two Christmas albums (one actually labeled as 'Sacred' and the other as 'Amazing Grace') sung by Cilete Swann and played by Roman, pure unadulturated talent. You can simply scare your friends and family this season with the through the roof mind-blowing abilities of all of these singers and musicians... with these album combinations...Enjoy!"
5,My son loves this,"I don't know why, but my 11mo old loves this toy. Well worth $10, maybe worth $50 for how much he plays with it."
3,Too hard for little kids.,"I got this item for my little girl's first birthday. She is now 16 months and she still can't do the top sorting part. The shapes of the letters make it so it is really hard to do it. You have to get the letter in just the right position to make it go in. She can't do it and ends up getting very frustrated and angry each time she plays with this toy. She likes that she can stuff things inside it, but even that is hard. The door to the barn does not open easily. She can't do it on her own, and brings it to my about every 2 minutes for me to open it again."
2,Not great,To get to the letters after you place them in the barn you must remove all the animals to open the barn door. My son gets frustrated with having to remove them. The letters seam really cheap on the toy. They are super light weight but also had bits of plastic sticking up. The toy just doesn't hold his interest. He has several other shape sorters that he loves. This one just isn't a hit. He likes animals and barns but this toy just doesn't hold the 'it' factor for him.
3,It's an okay toy,"My son is 18 months and has had this since he was 12 months old. He really likes the animals and likes to put them in their spots or just play with them by themselves. The ABC part...not so popular. It is a little bit lame that the animals block the barn door, but it hasn't really been an issue for us since if he uses the barn door it's usually to put the animals inside."
2,Poorly Designed,It has several design flaws. I would not buy this one again. Looks nicer than it is.
2,difficult,"I hate this toy. My daughter received it as a gift when she was 1, and she and my nephew would constantly fight to play with it. But they couldn't use the ABC shape sorter by themselves... they always needed help. So if I didn't always have time to sit and play with them for 20 mins it was a complete disaster. But again, the kids did love it, and now we've had it for about 2 years. My daughter still plays with it, and now she helps my 1yr old son use they toy. But I almost tossed this toy out on more than one occasion."
4,My son loves this!,"We got this as a gift and it was a hit with my son (6 months old then) right away! He loves to take out the animals and chew on them and he's been able to figure out how to open the barn door to get at the letters inside (8 months old now)! My only complaint is that the barn door doesn't open when the animals are in place. As far as cleaning, we just put the whole thing in the dishwasher when it starts to look dirty, so easy!!"
4,Simple toy but classic fun,"This is a very simple toy, doesn't make noise, basic shape sorter. And we like it! My son is under 12 months, but he enjoys handling the animals, opening the barn door, and I go over the letters and animal names with him. It's easy to clean, which I like. I'd say this is good from over 6 months to whenever they get bored with it. It's a colorful toy at a reasonable price! (if you get it on sale, like I did!)"
2,"Door broke, top doesn't open, different handle","My son (10 months old) loves this toy, but it hasn't held up well at all. The door broke off on the 6th day he had it. He loves playing with the door even though it's broken off, he puts it in the hole left by the door.I also wish the top hinged open so you could put the pieces away quickly, but it doesn't. My son isn't old enough to use the shape sorting aspect yet, I mainly bought this for the farm novelty and so he could put pieces in and take them out. Which he does do, but he turns the whole thing on its side so he can put pieces in and out via the door hole. I think he would like it even more if he could sit in front of it and open the top to put pieces in.Mine also doesn't have the upright handle as shown in the photo. Mine has a cutout in the back of the top, like a notch cut into the plastic where you're supposed to insert your fingers. The upright handle would have been much better.Overall, I am not happy with this product."
5,Cute.,Bought for my nephews 1st birthday. It is fun & entertaining. Great price too! Received it in record time. Can't go wrong with this toy.
4,1970's pulp!,"This is an out of print book and not one of Block's best known characters. Chip Harrison only has two murder mysteries (the Tulip Caper), and there's two lame 'Catcher in the Rye' coming of age books (what a waste). If you like Bernie Rhodenbarr, then you'll like Chip Harrison. If you like Matthew Scudder, well this probably isn't for you. The only other place I could find Chip Harrison stories were in the short story collection 'Enough Rope'."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"In this 9th volume of the Justice League of America Archives, the league was slowly starting to change with the sixties, with the Black Canary as a focus."
2,Didn't finish this book,This book is to violent for my tastes. I read a few chapters and then decided that I did not want to continue.
4,Decent Wagon,"Good price. As related in other reviews, the support in the middle of the wagon platform is lacking. And I discovered the wheels are spaced to close together to make it a stable enough while going over uneven terrain. The picture is that is posted is misleading in that regard. Overall decent purchase."
3,"""We never, ever do anything nice and easy"".....","....begins the delicious, drawn-out intro to ""Proud Mary"" (now mercifully unsplit between to LP sides like it was way back when).Unfortunately, judging them here at their coked-out best, they never ever did anything that wasn't padded-out with endless intro and jams. And you will be skipping those dead-weight Ikettes cuts after a single a playWhen they catch fire, they burn bright and hard, but this CD is a real advertisement for selective downloading, partic. Proud Mary and Tina's way over the top ""Loving You Too Long""."
3,NOT linux- frienly,"This was advertised as the linux version of the very popular UT for Win95&98. Not so; it IS the original game with a suggested site to download the no-longer-available linux version. At this price, I can't practically send it back for a theoretical refund. Especially since I had to peel off the independent dealer's plastic wrap to read the game requirements their sticker conveniently covered, Amazon can't help me recoup my small loss. I already own the Game of the Year edition with updated features, and bought this SPECIFICALLY because I needed the linux build since even the latest Wine emulator won't run the game.If you want the linux version, make sure it's the real thing. If you have a copy,I need it! Email ergbigred@yahoo.com to let me know or attach the file to the email with instructions, please."
5,My Favorite Blossom Dearie Album,"This is my favorite Blossom Dearie album -- I love her Verve stuff, but I like this lightly swinging collection with an orchestra by Jack Marshall even more. The songs are also fantastic -- ""Something Happens to Me,"" ""When Sunny Gets Blue,"" ""Quiet Nights,"" ""Don't Wait Too Long"" -- and that's just the beginning! Definitely a must-have for any Dearie fan. My only problem with this CD is it's length...it clocks in at just under 29 minutes."
5,Blossom does it again,"Although I like Blossom with the piano, bass and drums, this post-Verve release from 1964 complete with orchestra fills out the sound more brilliantly. The opening number ""Something Happens To Me"" is infectious."
4,Blossom in a mink coat,"NOT the best Blossom recording I've heard so far, but I'm a jazz fan and I prefer her in a jazzier context (with Ray Brown on bass and , I don't know, Jo jones on drums)...But this is still very nice and easy listening... Actually, ""Corcovado"" from this album makes me wonder whether she ever recorded a bossa nova album... If she didn't, it's a pity!Her unique naivete of voice would go well there...Tasteful blend of traditional pop and jazz - that's what I think of this album. Among the musicians are Jack Sheldon, a very fine trumpeter as you can hear, Shelly Manne (dm), Joe MOndragon (b),but there's no list of musicians (although the liner notes are otherwise OK"
4,Nice release,I bought this for my son last year and it has held up well. He uses it all the time and it has performed as expected. It was a great price and I would definitely buy another one.
4,First Shoot With New Bow,I like this product!! I shot only 5 arrows and like it. The trigger could be better designed to fit around the fingers otherwise good buy for the dollar!!
3,"Okay product, very sensitive trigger","I bought this as a backup and didn't want to spend over $20. The release is constructed fine and should be okay as a backup but I wouldn't use it everyday. The trigger was way too sensitive for my liking, I had to take the adjustment as far back as possible and it is still borderline to where I like my trigger sensitivity."
2,Enough Tributes,"I'm sorry, but I'm getting tired of these guest star/tribute albums. I'm finding most to be disappointing, including this one.Yes, the lineup on these two discs is outstanding, and I'm a big Ralph Stanley fan. The musicianship on the discs is, not surprisingly, first rate. Same for the recording and song selection. And Ralph is in fine form. But IMHO the sum does not equal the parts. There's no flow to the recording, and most importantly, there is a lack of intensity and feeling that is definitely present on so many of Stanley's other discs, solo and with the Clinch Mountain Boys. Iif you want to know what makes Stanley special, stick to his original stuff."
2,The Best of CCR,"This double cd set has many great songs. The two star rating I'm giving it is mostly because of the sound quality. I bought the cd set expecting a better audio experience than an mp3 format can attain. Well what a disapointment it was when I played it in my car and on my computer. The mix was muffled and of poor quality. If you're looking for a trip down memory lane with old 45s quality, then this may work for you! From now on I'll look for that magic word known as ""Remastered""."
3,Great CD's appalling liners and packaging.,"Great music and great compilation... nuff said.Liner notes: NONE. Production, design, artwork is appalling -- pathetic cover design.3 stars = 5 stars for music - 2 1/2 stars for lousy production + 1/2 star for two fuzzy color photos."
4,Typos! Typos! Typos!,"I thought this was an excellent easy read. Regardless of the accuracy of the story, it is a NOVEL. But the typos... Oh my!!! Sometimes coming two to the page. I have noticed this in many of the books being written today. The editors are not doing thier jobs and must be relying entirely on spell check."
5,A winner,"I read a lot and this book is one of the best I have read in a while. I could not stop thinking about it all day at work! I picked it up at about 10pm, said, I'll just read the jacket before going to sleep, then said, just the prologue, ok, just the first chapter and before you know it, it was midnight and I still did not want to put it down!... the serious amount of typos in this book should be embarassing to the author and the publisher. I even e mailed the publisher to tell them how ashamed they should be! I personally, as an author would be insulted!Even so..read this book!!!"
3,Not sure,"if it is accurate and that is a shame since I am a pastor's daughter. However, I do have to admit it was entertaining to think of them as real people. King David ended up becoming a character I didn't think was ok but I did enjoy this book overall. I do agree the typo's were outrageous and I have emailed the company twice about them!"
3,"Interesting, but a bit too long","After reading so many good reviews I expected more from this book. It was a slow read at times, and would have benefitted from having about one hundred pages cut out. The characters were not as well developed as they could have been--I never cared for or about them. While I liked Queenmaker better than The Red Tent, I thought The Midwife's Song: A Story of Moses' Birth was a better written book and engaging from the beginning to end."
3,challenging read,"I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars if I could, because it was a bit better than average. I chose this book because it had been compared to one of my favorites, The Red Tent. I don't think it was as good, for many reasons. Although the book did keep me interested, I kept waiting for it to get better. It seemed as though it had the potential for greatness but settled for ""really good"". I didn't care about the characters as much as in Red Tent. This book was extraoridinarily educational, and very challenging. It is not a book you will breeze through. The story is centered around King David's wife, Queen Michal. It is an insight into the lives of women in the biblical times. We journey with Michal through her first love, and heartbreak, through two marriages and her deep friendships with women. I wouldn't drop everything to run and read this book, but if you're interested in historical fiction, and have some time to spare, this may be the book for you!"
2,Very disappointing. Loosely based on the Bible??,"I was quite disappointed in this book to say the least. I was hoping for historical fiction more grounded in the life of David. I was hoping for more of a picaresque view of Jerusalem and the time period. Nowhere in the book does the author say how much of her information is from the Bible, if indeed any of it is. I am assuming she must have done SOME research, as she credits the main characters of Michal as being daughter of the eventually mad King Saul. And David as rising to King of Jerusalem after many battles and the slaying of Goliath. But most of the story reads as pure imagination. David is portrayed as a one-dimensional, uncaring, misogynistic and ignorant man. I was so frustrated by the gall of this book, I threw it out after reading 160 pages. I also found it not exceptionally written and honestly was more than a little bit bored."
2,Unbelievable change from the actual story,"This book was entertaining and I wish the author had not tried to make it about Biblical characters. I am always interested in the life of women during different time periods, but the change from the Bible story is ubelievable. The author should have just called it fiction and not tried to destroy the true story about a man who really was a great king with flaws like everyone else."
1,Could Have Been A Nice Book,"The topic is interesting and has the potential for an exciting story. However, this author chose to completely ignore the primary text which contains the actual history of events. One can have a little flexibility with the thoughts and emotions of an individual. But the refusal to include known events makes this entire novel ring false and hollow."
4,Aptly named,"It was a good read, so long as I kept one thing in mind: The King David of the book and the King David of the Bible are different characters. One, the Biblical one, existed. The one India writes about is only a figment of her imagination. I imagine she got a lot of him right. We know he was a harper, so I am sure he had a way with words. However, I simply cannot believe he was quite as bad as she makes him. Would God have continued to love and bless so selfish a creature? Not my Father. The real King David was human, of course. Aren't we all, but I refuse to believe he was 100% arrogant jerk without a godly selfless bone in his body.So, I have began reading the book of Samuel. This way, I can learn the true story of the kings in Israel. If nothing else, Queenmaker got me to pick up my Bible, which I had not done in a bit and needed to."
2,Disappointing,"If you are a Christian and you are looking for a book that closely follows the story of David and his family as related in the Old Testament, then this is not a book for you. I was very disturbed by the way this tale portrays King David (as an egomaniac) and by the drastic changes made in the biblical accounts of his family members. In the same way that I found _The Red Tent_ to be anti-Christian, I feel likewise about this book and wish I had never read it. It is not a book I will keep and I could never pass it along to a fellow Christian woman."
3,Not what I was expecting...,"Queenmaker had the difficult job of following The Red Tent on my reading list. If you are looking for a simple, interesting story somewhat grounded in the Bible, Queenmaker will do fine. If, like me, you are looking for an engrossing Biblical-era novel that really submerges you into the time period, this is not the novel for you. I found it pleasant enough, but very lacking in details."
1,"Christian Readers, Beware","A group of 20 of us read this for our monthly Book Club selection only to find that this book is grossly inaccurate biblically. We can appreciate a work of historical fiction if the basic facts are correct. However, this author took the character names from the Bible and drastically changed their stories to fit her whim. Yes, King David impregnated Bathsheba while she was married to another man. However, the baby died. He was not Solomon who later became King, nor is there any evidence that Michal and Bathsheba were friends and jointly raised Solomon. Again and again, there are major and disturbing discrepancies. It made us wonder about the author's religious beliefs and hidden agenda. We don't recommend this book unless you read it with the Bible in hand."
1,The Queenmaker,"I was very disappointed in this novel. I was expecting something to the effect of The Red Tent (which I thought was great), since it was compared to it on the inside cover. My expectations were too high. I struggled to finish this book. I found myself thinking out loud ""what was this writer thinking?""I totally understand that we all have our interpretations of Bible characters, but there was nothing to remotely associate these characters to history except that you ""knew"" they were Biblical characters. There is something left to be desired when a reader enjoys the secondary characters more the main ones.I would not recommend this book."
2,Not suitable for powerboaters,While many of the statistics listed in this book are quite useful to SAILING it has very little to do with living aboard a motor yacht (large or small). It certainly should list in the description what it does and doesn't cover. VERY disappointed.
2,Why didn't you tell me?,"It would have been nice to know that this book had zero zip snot to do with power boats before I bought it. Also, I find the author's info a bit suspect when he says he talked to one owner of a 42 foot power boat who spent $13000.00 a month on maintenance alone and based his entire decision not to include anything but sail boats based on this one interview.What the author does have is a love for bar and pie charts with a few actual graphs thrown in to break up the (intense) monotony. The problem is that none of them are in color so in some cases you have to try to differentiate between two shades of black. Had I picked this book up in a store I would have politely put it back on the shelf.The information is way out of date. One referance states that people were waiting for GPS units to drop below $1000!!! And the same section talks about the growing number of people who were getting a VCR."
2,Better than sleeping pills.,"Interesting, if you are an economist or if you operate like Bill Clinton and base each decision on an opinion poll. Hurry, someone take this guy's graph program away."
1,Methinks this book was written only to generate money for the author,I'm truly sorry I bought this book. Filled with worthless information(?).
4,Solid Entry In An Outstanding Series,"Andrew Vachss is a unique voice in American literature. This is another solid entry in the Burke series and provides a lot of what I have loved about reading this stuff for 16 years or so now - a great cast of characters, killer dialouge and a ""feel"" unlike any other noir material I know of . I admire Vachss the tireless crusader for children and I treasure Vachss the writer. If you like your reading served up nitty, gritty and no bull____ty - check this out!"
4,laconic style,"Vachss' fiction stalks starkely across the pages. It's a spreading shadow across the imagination of the reader. His sparse and Spartan style is in the best tradition of American language, terse and precise like Hemingway but tight as a drum. In a word, ""laconic"" like the character Burke himself.But for his disturbing, lurid and morally horrifying content, Vachss would be recognized as one of the best stylists of our day."
5,Everything Burke is...,"Great. Just love the entire series. The staccato writing style just works for me. Would love to see this on film, just can't imagine who would be Burke."
4,Best Burke in a while,"I've been a big fan of Vachss since Flood, but, while his already strong writing has steadily improved to where I find anything he writes a compelling read, many of the plots of the last few Burke novels have not been particularly compelling or memorable. Only Child would be the most recent example.Down Here, on the other hand, has everything you'd want in a topnotch Burke novel. It's a detailed interweaving of plots and counterplots, with the gripping, airtight prose of a master of the genre. Throw in Burke's wry observations of human nature and perfect blend of cynicism and compassion and you've got one of Vacchs' best."
2,"leaking in the first joint, but a little tape fixed it. You get what you paid for!","leaking in the first joint, but a little tape fixed it. You get what you paid for!"
1,Garbage,"I was really excited to get this thing, but it is cheap and it shows.The first joint is really hard to tighten (the part with the wingnut looking thing). My thumb hurts from trying to tighten it, but even then, if you bump it, it'll come downward.I finally get to the point where I think it's tight enough and I turned on the water. It started leaking in the first joint and after 5 seconds it came crashing downward.I'm hoping I can get a refund."
3,Visually Stunning,"This movie is perfect for Blu-ray. Its colors are vivid and its cinematography is amazing. As I said in the title it is visually stunning. The story itself is really simple, yet there are just enough twists to turn it into a pretty good tale.It's not an action extravaganza, but more of a love story, but when there is action it's decent. I think this movie starts slow, but when it ended I sat there thinking how much I enjoyed the trail on which it led me."
3,Vividly Colored Drama,"I'm not sure I can really critique something I can't experience and perceive in its native language. I do, however, think that time must move at a different and dynamic pace in China, as certain scenes seemed to me to take FOREVER, while others flitted by without me knowing what had just happened.It was absolutely gorgeous, with long panoramic scenes full of color and season."
2,pretty and vapid,"watch it on mute without subtitles. the plot is tired, poorly told, and seems like an after thought. worth a rental, not a purchase."
2,Disappointing and lacking soul,"While I greatly enjoy stylized action films (Hero, CTHD and the Killer come to mind) this film was so caught up in showing aesthetic sensibility that it loses emotional power. There are some fun scenes - the drum scene in the beginning, but ultimately the weak plot, weak motivation and somewhat banal action sequences undermine the pleasure from the few moments of creativity. My wife and I saw Hero the day after seeing this and both of us enjoyed that much more."
3,"Good, but:","There's always something retarded about Asian love stories (seriously, think of one Asian porn-star? ..I thought not). I'm sure there is something lost in the translation too: ""Your such a 'Playboy'"" didn't seem to fit with ancient China. But that's what this is; a love story with some great fight scenes. The story isn't half bad, I'd see it if you like the fights and special effects, but wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,A feast for the eyes but.....,"a dull, predictable story with lame dialog.My wife and I were eagerly anticipating seeing this film since we loved Crouching Tiger and thought Hero was pretty good.It seemed upon watching the film, however, that the director is focused on beautiful imagery and imaginative use of color and action at the expense of story and dialog. The story was dull with many climaxes and much melodrama (a dead character rises from the snow....and we knew it was coming!). And how many references to ""wind"" can we hear before the point is made ad nauseum? We went from being amazed at the imagery to rolling our eyes and essentially predicting dialog and plot twists before they happened with about 90% accuracy.The worst thing though? That the movie, despite the action, etc., was boring."
2,Nothing even worthy of BD transfer,"I like movies with good storylines and well written scripts. I totally enjoy intelectual plots and even some blind twists. I like beautiful HD video and great surround sound audio with exceptional staging.The HOFD movie had its moments, but they were very few. The opening dance, the bamboo walking, and from there it was either over-the-top or just ridiculous. The love story gone bad gave way to terminator 2.The engish dub was sad. It had all the passion of a 1970's kung fu fest. I would bet that the LPCM Chinese audio would have boosted my rating a star - It would have to be the better choice by far, if you understand it.Anyway, I thought Crouching Tiger was pretty good, but this one really tanked for me. When I buy a Blu-Ray, I hope for a movie that we could watch more than once. This one will probably be in the pile gettin dusty on the bottom shelf."
3,"Good movie, but bad quality transfer","I have the DVD of this, and in most of the movie, the DVD version looks better. The Blu-Ray version is so blurry and out of focus that I thought something was wrong. The only thing on the whole disc that looks nice is the trailers for Hitch and Resident Evil 2, which are sharp and colorful.The sound in the movie is great, with uncompressed LPCM 5.1 (which has a bitrate so high that its about the same as the VIDEO on a DVD (around 4500kbps) and it also has DD 5.1.I guess since this is a first-gen Blu-Ray disc that it will look a little blurry, but I can't understand why the movie looks so bad, but the trailers look amazing.Hopefully, future Blu-Ray discs will look better.Using an Acer Travelmate 8210-6038 to watch the Blu-Ray."
5,house of amazing daggers,this movie has truly transcended this genre of film....absolute stunning landscape....excelent cinemetography....superb fight scenes it has Yimou Zhang....need i say more
4,Very entertaining,"I'm glad this movie came along.It arrived just in time to savemy expiring interestin the Neo-""Martial Arts"" genre.I'm a true martial arts fan, but Igenerally prefer the movieswhere there is more emphasis on fightingthan glitz and glitter.""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was innovativeand exciting when it came along, but the subsequentremakes and imitations are annoying.Watching people fly (and dramatically defying the lawsof gravity and common sense) quickly becomes tiresome.This move offers some of the same elementsbut to a lesser degree and it's artistically done.It offers an engaging story that holds your attentionfrom start to finish.It's remarkably colorful and displays very beautifullead actors. The fight scenes are incredible.I really enjoyed this film, and I'm sure mostmartial arts film lovers will also."
2,Caution: Beware of the Bluray version - poor video transfer,"First, i loved this movie... the story, cinematography, etc. is up there and reflected in the dvd related reviews here... no argument therei just rented the bluray version from blockbuster (i have a samsung bd-p2500 player) and noticed immediately 'pixel dancing' on the screen (i have a samsung 1080p dlp tv.. so the player and tv work very well together)having worked with graphics some, my educated guess is that the bluray version appears to be a reprocessing of the dvd digital data. the resolution on screen is NOT at all at par with any other bluray disk i've viewed so far. it shows artefactual noise of digital image upscalingif the dvd version is cheaper for this title, i'd select it over the bluray version as the latter is not genuinely high resolution."
2,Bad Transfer to Blu Ray,"This is a good story, great effects etc- you can see all of that in the other reviews-- my issue is that I support those who say this transfer is LOUSY----I saw this picture twice in theaters and own the regular DVD--I was excited in anticipation of the Blu Ray as the amazing color palette of the director should have jumped off the screen--It is no better than the standard DVD and, in fact, looks washed out in some of what should be it's best scenes...The producers of this Blu Ray should be lined up with Bernie Madoff and shot..."
4,Don't take it seriously,"This film confused me at first. There were what one might call subtle bloopers right from the start. However, as the film wore on, I realized that it had to be a comedy, and really liked it. I'm not sure if that was how it was intended, but if it was, it is a very ingenious, comedic use of cliche, subtle mistakes, and some simply bizarre elements. I only gave it four stars because if it was intended to be taken seriously, I think it would have to be considered sloppy and rather cheesy."
3,Could Of Been Sharper,"exquisite colors.rich in saturation of colors.the only places this movie lacked from getting a 4 or 5 star rating was in the sharpness and the bleeding of the colors,the reds had a little color bleeding along with the greens,its still the best copy out there your gonna get."
1,Absurd fantasy!,"I must admit that I always enjoy the female actor who plays the leading female role but this time it was just not a believable story line and played in English the film appears quite robotic in the character interplay. A made-in-China movie and for the most part, it was a boring display of violent fantasy. The love interest wasn't believable and the sex scenes are totally juvenile. It was PG-13 which disturbed me very much. The ONLY thing that wasn't there was the usual cursing and blasphemy. Everything else was there, simulated sex, violence and intense melodrama which was way over the top for anyone under the age of 18. I advise anyone thinking of owning and watching this to reconsider and find something else. And even though it was only a penny that was even too much since the shipping was $3.00. Way too much $ for this foreign job. The Robin Hood theme is a total fantasy idea. Leads to class warfare and violence. Sound familiar anyone?"
2,"Very beautiful and well produced, but that's it","Everything in this movie pales before its beauty, and I put the fight scenes in the beautiful category too, since they're the magical kind that aren't remotely possible. The plot, the characters and the reasons for most of the fight scenes are all flimsy pretexts to making a beautiful movie, and mere beauty, no matter how magnificent, doesn't make a complete or good movie for me."
4,This movie is worth it for the Dance Scene,"I can't tell if it's for real, or a stunt.There is a dance scene with a blind woman doing aerial acrobatic dancing and hitting drums with her long sleeves. Meanwhile, marbles are being thrown on the floor at her feet. Kept up a good drum rhythm, too.The plot is along opera type themes."
1,I was very disappointed,"I am a big fan of martial arts films -- having lived in Taiwan. However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion. The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times. I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one. It was down-right goofy at times. I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not."
1,Sony needs to remaster,This was one of the first movies Sony did on Blu-ray. They had not worked out the bugs. It shows. They have remastered The Fifth Element to great reviews. Sony needs to remaster this movie and offer buyers of this version a free exchange. It is such a visually stunning movie that this Blu-ray version is a crime.
4,House of Flying Daggers...,"The Cinemantography was great, the storyline was decent. Good special effects. Four stars!!"
2,Poor Blu-Ray Transfer,"I think Sony should remaster this film. The blu-ray transfer quality is very poor. On 50"" plasma, it looks much worse than other WB blu-ray movies. The video quality is only slightly better than the regular DVD."
5,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!,"After buying Iron Monkey, House of Flying Daggers popped up as an Amazon recommendation. It sat on my wish list for a year before I bought it because I knew very little about it. I've always loved these movies for their action, but I didn't expect this beautiful love story as well. And the soundtrack is just as wonderful."
2,visually stunning but seriously flawed,"the cinimatography is stunning, vibrant & exquisite. it captivates the viewer but doesn't quite cover for a vacuous, almost non-existant plot. the acting is adequate, but the story line is in places confusing & pointless. the backdrops & special effects will nevertheless hold your attention - but its better enjoyed when viewed as a series of colorful paintings than a film of merit."
2,Quality belows average,"It is a great movie. The disc's quality is really bad. I should not have bought movie disc from other country. Pay a little more, you will get a high quality disc in the U.S."
2,a joke?,"The only redeeming quality of this movie is the special effects. The story line is laughable and the acting is comical as well. When I sat through the movie in the theater, there was one guy hysterically laughing throughout the whole thing and no one told him to shut up (I'm assuming becuase everyone else agreed with his assessment)."
1,Melodramatic and animal cruelty.,"Not worth your time. This movie was melodramatic and overblown, with a flat story line. Visually pretty, but that's not enough. Horses tripped at opening of movie -- well, foreign movies are not always subject to laws we take for granted. Junk, all around."
2,Wow!,"Wow! There sure are a lot of reviews about this movie which hasn't even arrived in the US yet. I saw this movie on DVD while I was in Hong Kong in October of 2003.The Movie Studios must tell the cast and crew... ""Don't forget to go to Amazon and give our movie a good rating.""I have seen several customer reviews this past year that start out with a line about how ""this movie is OK considering all the bad movies hollywood puts out each year.""If your into the genre its a good way to kill an hour and half, that's about it. No where near as good as ""Hero""."
3,Good Fight scenes,"I saw this movie on my trip to china over the summer. I read an article in the newspaper, and it got horrible review over there for many reasons. I won't give away the ending, but i know that myself, and the rest of the audience had a good laugh at it when it should have been dramatic and anything but funny. I have to say that i cant rate this movie on its entirety because when i saw it it was in chinese with chiense subtitles, and my knowledge of both is extremely limited, so i wont give it lower then a three for that reason. If you are looking for fight scenes, then this movie is great, but dont expect a real tear jerker, its just too funny."
3,Lower Caliber Asian Martial Arts Movie,"If you like the art and beauty of most asian movies, you will not like House of Flying Daggers. While the plot and story line is rather intriguing, the fighting scenes have lower standards than those used by is predeccessors. This movie takes away the art and the grace that makes asian film so unique. If you want to be swept away, watch a movie such as HERO."
2,Not pure enough.,"yep...too much of colors, too much of floating fight scenes, too much of illogical and often unneeded romance. basically ... too much of everything patched together at the same time!I want to love this movie, but I just cant. After going through this movie I could not help but wonder that the director BADLY wanted to cash in on the 'consumed in love' + 'color arts' + 'floating fighting' factor. It struck me instantly that this movie is a sellout manifestation straight from directors brain. Its just not pure enough for the kind of movie it strives to be.Net Effect: In totality HOFD exudes no magic. Break it into smaller pieces and observe -- why ppl are actually calling this movie 'good'"
2,Made me laugh,"First of all, the scenery was breathtaking. The scene with the dancing and the gongs and everything was fantastic. Everything else kind of fell flat. This movie was supposed to be romantic and stuff but it was pretty comedic. I was laughing my head off in the last scene! And it was supposed to be sad! The plot was overly-gag-me cheesy and unrealistic (how could Mei still be alive after all that?!?). Fortunately the characters were overall likeable, except for Mei's psycho ex-boyfriend...please. And the fact that she should be a mondo-good martial artist but still almost gets raped, like, five times is so extraordinairly improbable (not to mention dumb)! By the way, the sex on the forest ground was totally unneeded. Overall this movie is sappy and overdramatic. I recommend you to pick it up at the library if you want a few laughs. Don't waste your money on this...film...if you want a good romantic/martial artsy movie buy 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or 'Hero' instead."
1,Do Not Buy the Current Blu-ray !!!,"As others have warned, Sony seriously botched the job on this film's transfer to Blu-ray... so bad that it seems irresponsible to be selling this far inferior product when compared to the regular DVD. Until Sony reissues a remastered version, don't waste your money!"
3,"Great movie, but disappointing blu-ray","I saw this movie several years ago on a small tv screen and remembered really liking it. I particularly remembered how stunningly beautiful it was visually, so when I saw the blu-ray I couldn't wait to see it on a big screen in hd. The movie is still wonderful, but the picture quality of the blu-ray is really disappointing. It's very grainy. The colors, which I remembered being so gorgeous, are even diminished. Its a real shame. Hopefully they will re-issue a better version on blu-ray, because watching it again I'm just thinking how much I would love to see it in real HD."
4,An unexpected love story,"I purchased ""Flying daggers"" thinking it would be an interesting and beautifully filmed action movie. while it is that, I was surprised at the depth of the love story that propels this movie forward. It seems more a fable of old, a story meant to convey a moral lesson and it does and I found myself truly enjoying (and missing) this genre. I would highly recommend this movie. Just be aware that it is not an all-action tale but rather an very sweet love story with some very cool fight scenes."
5,House of Flying Daggers soars over your highest expectations,"House of flying Daggers is a beautiful movie full of lush scenes and brilliant colors. It has elements in it that is not often found in so many American movies. Such as the rich hues of clothing, or lush, magical feelings of landscapes and fighting.Although I didn't find it quite as engrossing as Hero, this movie is just as melodramatic, the ending especially so. And just as in Hero, mostly everyone dies. The love triangle in this film is only a tad different. It being two men who love a woman instead of Hero's man being the revolving factor.Its interesting how Yimou Zhang can take such basic plots and convert them into such amazing movies. Because if you look at it, Hero and House of flying Daggers are basically movies on human emotions and the choices we make, the outcomes and what could have happened instead.A great Drama/action movie."
3,Not a 'Hero' quality story but worth a watch,"It is completely pounded into the viewer that Kaneshiro's character is a womanizing ""Playboy"". Then you must convince yourself to drop what you have learned about the character when he falls in love after 3 days with Zhangs character. Other than the character flip-flops and odd twists, this is a beautiful movie. Bottom line: rent this movie and go buy 'Hero'."
2,From another Chinese viewer...,"I rented this movie over the weekend so I could decide if I was going to buy it. Decided against buying it. The movie is slow and drawn out. This is really a love story with martial arts in it. If you're looking for a martial arts movie, move on to something else. If you're looking for a love story, there are better stories out there."
1,"If you have the DVD, don't buy the Blue-ray: Terrible image quality!!!!","The PS3's images are too bright and blurry. I have to change the TV video mode from Vivid to Standard. The DVD upconverted to 720p/1080i from Zenith DVB318, looked BETTER than the 1080p image coming from the PS3 through HDMI!Sony should recall this Blue-ray . . . .Kung Fu Hustle Blue-ray looks/sounds excellent."
5,Awesome!!,"Came on time! In good shape, and not to mention I love this movie! Thank you very much! I would recommend this product to others who enjoy a good movie."
3,"Awesome Movie, Poor Video Quality","The movie is awesome! Rich scenery, good character development. The movie itself is 4.5 stars. The video quality; however, stinks. It looks like they just extrapolated the regular DVD movie and put it on BD media to call it ""Blu-Ray"". Tons of particles on screen. It a low-down dirty shame..."
5,Love this movie....,"I had misplaced my DVD a while back and the only other copy I located was a English only copy....And since this is one of my favorite movies, and I love Ziyi, watching it with English audio was not an option with me, so I had to purchase the DVD again to watch it in the way it was designed to be watched....Chinese audio and English subtitles....so much better this way, try it and you'll never go back...."
3,Hmmmm,"Some of the action sequences in this film came across as cheesy, without the grace that I found in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, though some of the other scenes were nice and some of the backdrops were truly impressive. However, I was not impressed with the revelation of who the main female character really was, so I found myself unable to give this film any higher than three stars."
2,Just so-so,"This was below average for this type of money, because there wasn't much of a story. Also, why were there not any royals depicted in this movie?My biggest problem with this movie was WHERE THE HECK DID THESE HORSES APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE? This happened more than once, where they walk for awhile, then all of a sudden horses are magically there. Thnik we wouldn't notice?Also, were we to believe that those 2 guys fought continously from fall through winter? And that the lady lasted for months lying there with a dagger in her?"
1,Beautiful But Stupid,"Beautiful scenery but a hopelessly bad film.The story could have been written by a group of teenaged boys all suffering from ADD who have an unhealthy obsession with Japanese manga and a rudimentary grasp of human relationships.The film is full of simplistic plot developments that serve only to move the action from one pretty place to another. Television ads for SUVs show more concern for telling a story than this film.And there are amazing lapses of continuity: Jin's bow appears when bad guys show up and disappears after the action is over. Leo and Jin battle as the general's troops descend from the hills. But, the troops never arrive. This is sloppy film making and sloppy editing.Zhang Yimou's films are pretty but empty of all else that makes for entertainment."
2,Dissapointing,"I'm a big fan of the genre; Crouching Tiger blew me away, and Hero had a place in my heart the first time I saw it. So it was with great anticipation and high hopes that I saw this movie.I was sorely dissapointed. The use of vivid colors complimented the story in Hero. In Flying Daggers, the colors were the story. The plot was backseat to visual effects. I literally got a headache from the swift and ridiculous twists that read more like a soap opera."
1,Another flashy but dreary downer of a martial arts movie,"Yes, this movie is very showy, flashy and stylized in its photography - but like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' this film also ultimately wallows in romance, death, violence and tragedy. just a real downer.After watching this you may need to watch the 'White Dragon' (a rare romantic comedy - asian martial arts movie with a happy ending). this movie stars Cecilia Cheung - who i prefer than Ziyi Zhang, though both are good. Francis Ng is also very good in 'White Dragon'.peace out & cheers!-CrowTurtle"
2,Overly Melodramatic,"This movie is really boring. It almost made me laugh while I wasn't supposed to. Sometimes I just wanted to fast foward. The characters are underdeveloped and the story isn't touching as it is supposed to be. Cinemography and scenery are great, and that's why I gave the two stars. The fighting scenes are just so so. Too much CGI for my taste."
3,Beautiful but inconsistent and illogical,"Possible spoiler to follow!!!!I would first note that this movie is beautifully done. The sets, the scenery and the cinematography are all very nice. Certainly visually stunning, as is Zhang Ziyi. The story is another matter.The first two thirds or so of this movie is quite intricate and interesting and seems to be setting us up for a worthy resolution. The resolution however reveals fatal flaws in logic to say the least. The ending was in general predictable--why do Chinese filmmakers think that killing off lovers is art? A lover dying at the end of a Chinse movie is as predictable as John Wayne killing the bad guys. It's not art to kill off a star crossed lover if everyone sees it coming and certainly not if it makes no sense.As for the manner of Mei's death, none of the scenes in the movie was more fantastic than her immaculate resurrection. It seems clear to me that the writer just didn't know how to end this thing."
2,Disappointing,"It's disappointing. What happens to the House of Flying Daggers? As the suspense builds up toward the end, I was expecting an explosion of the love triangle where the heroes take sides and a final battle between the daggers and the general's troops concludes the movie. This movie doesn't do justice for the heroes' skills and heroism. Instead, they end up killing each other nonsensically. There are also some inconsistencies. Non-stop fighting between the heroes from fall until winter is silly and probably taken from legend where they fight for 40 days and 40 nights. I know it's only a movie but it should be a little more believable. At the end, I have the feeling that this movie is incomplete."
4,good until the last five minutes,"This is a stunningly beautiful movie. The director has a wonderful I for seeing the beauty of nature and capturing the innocence of his star, Zhang Ziyi, however without giving too much away the last five minutes was extremely frustrating. Those who have seen the movie I am sure know what I mean, but if you are down stay down. I did not realize snow had resurrecting powers.There will of course be comparisons to ""Hero"" and while for most of the movie it compares well, in the end it just falls short. If I had to keep one or the other, the answer would be ""Hero""."
4,House of Flying Daggers,Absolutely loved this movie. I never get tired of watching it. Loved all the actors especially Takeshi Kaneshiro!
3,"More ""Feelings"" than ""Kung Fu Fighting""","Like our trade deficit with the Middle Kingdom, Chinese action films just seem to be getting more and more lavish and spectacular. This trend reached a pinnacle with ""Hero,"" a movie experience so overwhelming I actually felt tired after watching it. I was expecting even more from ""House of Flying Daggers,"" but the director dials back the action and dials up the drama. MISTAKE! Although there are some touching moments and Takeshi Kaneshiro has a wonderfully expressive face, I don't go to action films for long anguished discussions of ""where is this relationship going."" A few great scenes with daggers and bamboo don't quite make up for long minutes with the camera trained on Zhang Ziyi's beautiful but mask-like face. Don't waste your dollars on this film, better titled ""Bridget Jones Does Beijing."""
1,"Cute, but very Cruel","Who wouldn't enjoy having this sit on their desk? I know I would. But the fish inside wouldn't.No animal, big or small, should be subjected to a life like this. Need a little help? Imagine your dog being trapped inside your laundry room or smallest bathroom where she can hardly stretch out her legs, all day, every day. Or imagine yourself in that situation. No one should be put through this, and I strongly ask shoppers to leave this item on the shelf.Perhaps a manufacturer will tell you that the fish enjoy the enviroment. Could you find a fish cooped up in a space this small naturally? Fish belong in ponds and lakes and oceans, or at a minimum in a tank where they may roam. Please, for the sake of the fish, do not purchase this product."
3,A Fish Tank to Pray For,"This modern fish tank is a pretty clear indication of how design is becoming precise. It is sleek, refined and especially sexy for Japanese tourists. I don't like it myself because of the specks inside the glass of the tank which radiate light from small ingrained bulbs. Use mild, non-streak cleaner to wash windows free of soot, even comes with ""egg fish starter kit"" and a stuffed lobster toy named ""Samji""."
3,"Not a good light, not a good fish bowl, but an interesting product nonetheless","This product doesn't really succeed as either a light or a fish bowl, but it's still interesting. The light is small and dim. You probably won't even be able to read by it. In my opinion, the bowl is also entirely too small for a fish, even a betta. It's not even half a gallon, and the directions suggest only filling it up half way. Your fish will barely be able to move. With that being said, the AquaBetta light has ornamental value even if it serves no real function. I have an aquatic plant growing in mine, and it's a fascinating display device. (Just make sure you have the AquaBetta somewhere it can get at least indirect natural light; don't count on the small bulb in the lamp itself.)"
3,"I love this set-up, but...","This is a beautiful set-up. But, the glass bowl is quite thin and we broke it on the 1st water change putting the gravel back in. We cannot find a replacment anywhere. Even the manufacturer doesn't have naything published on it!"
2,"Looks Good, Bad for Fish","This is an amazing looking fish tank.. it is bright, easy to see into and the direct light provides viewing into it 24 hours a day..That being said, it is hard to clean, hard to feed and more importantly WAY to small for any fish. My betta fish stopped building bubble nests as soon as I place him into this tank, which meant that he was not happy.. and after a few weeks I placed him a bigger bowl, where he thrives and bubbles like crazy.Every single betta information I read talks about how this size bowl is extremely bad for the fish, and frankly I hate dead fish. If they were to make a bigger, easier to clean and feed version of this I might pick it up, but until then no way."
4,What a great novel,"I was a little leary about starting this book, something about the jacket description or the cover, I'm not sure. But once I picked up this novel I realized I was definitley wrong. This novel is so well written, there were sentences I read more than once just to be able to take it all in. If you like a lyrical well-written novel you need to read this!"
2,Better Books to Choose,"My book club chose this book based on a short write-up in a recommended reading list for book clubs. A story from the perspective of four women who loved the same man. We had just finished a much more serious book and were looking for something a little saucier. This book is odd. The book is not evenly weighted among the women, who are not fully developed as characters, each of which you feel a lack of attachment to. The perspective of the book shifts and be a bit abrupt at time and includes bits of information that just don't seem to fit with the storyline. Consistent with the rest of the book it all just ends randomly. My roommate read it and immediately put it in the recyling bin because she wouldn't recommend it to anyone and wouldn't bother to resell it."
1,waste of time,"I just finished reading this book and would like to throw it out the window. I usually like to finish what I started so I forced myself to finish the book just to see how it ends. The begining was interesting but the rest of the story was confusing. The main idea of 4 different woman loving the same man was incredibly stupid. I thought the focus was on genevieve in the begining but suddenly switched to Gerard? The length of time for each character's story was so random it threw me off. Why was Gen's story so long and focused but the other women such as the governess or marie have such a short insignificant role when the idea was to make them major characters? I enjoyed how well the story is written but I hate what the story was about. It was demeaning to those women. There was no great lesson to be learned, just a bunch of women swooning over one man."
3,Don't buy second edition. Buy third edition.,"Purchasing the second edition of this book was entirely my error. I should have researched the contents before I ordered the book. However, since I ordered the book to research stored procedures and triggers, the book was of no use to me. As soon as I realized my mistake I ordered the third edition. The second edition covers MySQL features through version 4.1 only. If you don't care about stored procedures, triggers and version 5 features, the second edition should do the job for you. Otherwise, order the third edition."
1,Watered down waste,Does not do anything it claims to do. In this genre of supplements I have tried countless products. This one rates at the bottom. Hopefully you can save the money I wasted. Have an AWESOME day :)
3,Photos,"This book does not have the original photos which is actually why I wanted the book. I think Amazon should say that on the website as a heads up. It has sketches and some graphs/maps only, but the photos that give such a vivid account of the times are sadly missing. Does anyone know where I could get a copy of the original book?"
3,Variable; Buddy Holly redux or not?,"Starting trax are cardboardy, would not tax performers in elementary school (except #2 Texas swing w/ guest female lead.) Have heard modern group live in real concert and they did not sound anything like whoever these dust dwellers might be. Then a miracle happens. Group rediscovers roots as Buddy Holly's band and presents numerous full-bodied heavy beat trax which could be the Great Man singing in modern sound almost. Worth it to Holly lovers who have track selection capability in CD unit."
3,OK,Absolutely adorable. But all the zipper pulls have fell off and the Pony's tail is not such a good idea. It wasn't long before it got all ratty looking (no matter that I put it in a braid and ponytail).
4,Don't understand book price,"I have had two copies of this paperback, and the price marked on them is $7.95. The prices given here for the paperback are over $80.00. It's a good book but not that good. What gives???? I wanted to give copies to two young friends but at this rate, there must be a website they can use."
5,Towards Understanding a Faith series,"The book is really useful in informing about Islam. About the book makes itself self explanatory: ""An overview of the beliefs and customs of Islam, including an introduction to sacred texts, a history of the religion, important holidays, and worship practices around the world.""This series 'World Beliefs and Cultures,' intended audience is young adults."
2,Uncomfortable handset,"I bought one of these because I wanted a well made phone. Unfortunately, it was very uncomfortable to hold, and the channel button got in the way when I was talking...my chin kept hitting it and making it beep! I got so frustrated with how ergonomically lousy it was that I returned it and got a Sony. The Sony is fine, by the way."
3,Smooth techno,"The CD maintains a techno flavor while the lyrics are sending positive messages about life. Very upbeat and ""Believe"" (abductee mix) is a nice little club tune."
4,The Short Stories of B.H. Bentzman,"The book has sixteen stories of several subjects: romantic, breaking into places, photography (I love that one ""The Patron"") I whish I can have that photography, hospitals, medicine, many up to day stories. B.H. Bentzman is very knowledgeable in many subjects, and it shows in these stories. That knowledge makes the great majority of his stories captivating, some grab you that you cannot put the book down until finish reading the story, and then you want to go to the next one. B.H. Bentzman has a great command of the English language and uses very precise and correct words to describe the characters or the ambient in which the stories do occur. One of the most stimulating stories is the one about Judas. Don't miss that one."
4,Kookie!,I love the Ultra Lounge volumes for their unusual songs. They remind me of the old films with the ladies synchronized swimming in their flowered caps. Fun party music.
5,A Must Have!,"The Good Timing Guide is a must have! This book is so easy to read and use. You don't have to know anything about astrology. You can easily select dates with the best outcomes for any business (and many personal) activities using color codes. You will also know what dates to avoid at all costs. I've worked around Mercury Retrograde dates in business for over 25 years with much success, but I never paid much attention to Void of Course Moons (timeouts!). Working around timeout periods (which occur every few days) is really improving my results. Once you get your Good Timing Guide be sure to order the quarterly newsletters and email updates. They will help you stay focused. I highly recommend both."
5,Flatland,"When you want to read Flatland in optimal conditions and want to know everything about it, it's a must have."
2,Anti-women...,"I know this was written a long time ago, but I could not get past the anti-women sentiments in here. I tried really hard to ignore it and plug on, because people I respect have recommended this book, but I just couldn't get past it."
5,Mathematics fun,A wonderful little fantasy tale that explains mathematical concepts of dimensions from the point of view of a 2-dimensional world. It is a fun way to introduce others (notably children) to the wonder of mathematics and the joy of discovery.
2,pretend food,"I was very dissapointed in this food. I spent alot of time searching for food that was ""big"" so my grandaughter would not choke on it but still could have fun playing with it. When I got it, I was very unhappy with how many small pieces there were. In the picture the food looks large. I had to take most of it away from her until she is older. She tried eating all of it and alot of it fit right in her mouth and she could have easily choked on it. For the price I could have gone to Toys R Us and got the same food and alot cheaper."
2,Best Seller Giant Deluxe Pretend Play Food Set,We felt we were misrepresented by the ad. This is suppose to be a deluxe pretend play food set and yet it cost over $10.00 more than a similar set that offers 101 pieces sold by Step2. Where also is the gift box it is suppose to be in? Our grandaughter was excited about us ordering the food and was disappointed when she saw it.
3,See this author's later books,Ayaan Hirsi Ali is on a lifelong journey and her narrative gives valuable insights for others facing a similar challenge. This book is a halting and immature beginning. Her later books develop the twists and turns of the journey much more fully and provide a startling window on the trek from traditional tribal Islamic life to modern secular western reality.
3,Infidel was more intellectually invoking and moving,Ali was brave to write this book. It wasn't as interesting or thought-provoking as Infidel and there seemed to be a lot of repetition. Nevertheless her critique of Islam has always stirred up controversy and she is brave for aggressively condemning the radicals and fighting for the liberation of women as a feminist.
2,Not a vook; a collection of essays,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. It's not really a book, it's a collection of essays by the author, most of which are repetitions of each other, and diatribes against female genital mutilation. (Don't get me wrong; I'm totally against such a procedure, but the essays are essentially repetitions of themselves.) It's also against the Muslim practice of female degradation and treatment of women in general. But, if I wanted a collection of essays (I don't, and didn't), I would not like this book anyway, as it's essentially a repetition of the same thing over and over.If you want essays instead of a book, you still won't like this. If you like a book instead of a collection of essays, you REALLY won't like this."
1,Box extremely damaged,"Items not as described. Boxes were not in mint condition. both of the boxes were in extremely damaged condition. As a collector this was extremely important, there is hardly any resale value if the box is heavily damaged. Extremely disappointing and will not be purchasing anything but books on amazon in the future. Two items purchased from this person."
3,"great songs, bad production","Not that this thing sounds bad--in fact it's better engineered than most of the stuff that ranks on Hi-Fi's big list.The problem is that whoever is doing the arranging and instrumentation is stuck in an '80s zone. When I hear these songs, I always appreciate Neil Finn's craftsmanship, but I cringe when I hear the '80s keyboards and shimmery sound.If someone out of Elephant 6 were to get ahold of Finn, you'd have a classic LP worthy of anyone's DID list. That, or a retro blues producer who knows how to put up two or three mikes and leave well enough alone.It could be that since Crowded House had marginal chart success with their early singles, they're playing to the bonehead US market with the ""big"" sound, but they're cheating themselves by creating AOR fodder instead of classic pop music."
3,typical record company marketing ploy....,"I was going to buy this cd, but then I saw that ""Now we're getting somewhere"" was not on it. It appears to me that this is a typical record company ploy to get people to buy two crowded house records when they would otherwise buy only one. I'm not familiar with all of their work, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if their ""very best"" songs(including ""Now we're getting somewhere) were all on their first album."
5,"Crowded House, we hardly knew ye","They only lasted a decade, but in that short time Crowded House managed to release four sterling pop/rock albums, each with a different soundscape; their jangly, boisterous debut, the beautifully eerie ""Temple of Low Men,"" the meticulously-crafted ""Woodface,"" and ""Together Alone,"" wild as the New Zealand coast near which it was recorded. Fans of pop gems like ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Better Be Home Soon"" will have plenty to sing along with, but there are just as many forays into un""chart""ed territory: lead singer Neil Finn seems to channel George Harrison on ""Not the Girl You Think You Are""; log drummers add Maori polyrhythms to ""Private Universe."" For the collector, there are three brand new tracks featuring former Crowdie Paul Hester back on drums. In short, ""Recurring Dream"" will make you want to come back to the House over and over again."
5,Melodic Pop/Rock at it's best,"I'll admit it, the first time I heard Crowded House was while watching TV. Some real estate developer had used ""Don't Dream It's Over"" for a commercial, and I was blown away, but I thought it was written just for the commercial. Anyway, one night I'm flipping channels and MTV Asia's Classic MTV show comes on...and they play the video. The band name? Some New Zealanders called Crowded House. Anyway I bought this CD a couple of weeks ago. Sheer brilliance.Neil Finn has a knack of writing killer lyrics woven into amazing melodies. Besides ""Don't Dream It's Over"", there's the upbeat ""Locked Out""; ""Weather With You"", which sort of encompasses the same theme as ""Don't Dream It's Over"", but cheerier; the ghostly ""Four Seasons In One Day""...the 19 tracks here are all memorable. Put this on your Christmas wishlist...you won't be disappointed."
5,Wishing There Was More,"In this day and age of bubblegum music, hip-hop, and boy bands, it is so refreshing to know that an album full of great songs written by great songwriters is out there. This is a collection of beautiful and haunting harmonies (Weather With You, Four Seasons In One Day), feel good tunes (Something So Strong, It's Only Natural), and perhaps the most poignant song ever written (Better Be Home Soon). This is a must album for anyone who appreciates real music, real lyrics, and tremendous harmonies. Neil Finn is right up there with Lennon/McCartney as a lyricist. Music like this doesn't exist anymore. Who else could write ""You can go sailing in, climb down/ Lose yourself when you linger long/ Into temptation, right where you belong.""? A collection of some of the greatest songs ever."
4,Underrated...,"Crowded House will go down in music history as a group that had one significant hit, ""Don't Dream It's Over."" The song is classic, but this album shows that the group had more to offer than just one song. It's a shame that groups like Crowded House became part of the laughing stock of eighties one-hit wonders. ""Weather With You"" and ""Not The Girl You Think You Are"" show Neil Finn's ability to craft good pop songs. Crowded House is very good, but I still consider them a branch off of the Beatles (then again, how many people aren't?) That is why I give them four stars, rather than five. Amongst eighties groups, they were certainly one of the top ten highlights. Listening to them now in the nineties, Crowded House reminds me of how not so long ago, pop music could be creative, accesible, and more important...GOOD!"
4,Sad To See This One,"I really didn't want to get this CD or even to see it. A ""Greatest Hits"" CH album which came out on the news that the band had broken up. The year before I had gotten ""Finn Brothers"" and liked it (and I appreciate it more now) but really longed for a new CH album. Their first 4 are classics to me and occupy a special space on my shelf next to my beloved Beatles CD's.The best thing about this collection, for me is the photos. The back cover especially. (I know, that's weird, sorry) The 3 new tracks here are okay (I like the slow shuffle of ""Not The Girl You Think You Are"")...but I think I could have pulled three gems from the existing albums (""Chocolate Cake"" ""Whispers And Moans"" ""Kare Kare"") and put them here instead. I still give it 4 stars because their are many of Neil's great song here."
5,A collection of gems,"I've been a Crowded House fan for ten years. To say their songs are great would be an understatement. You can't really describe music like this. One of my favourite songs is ""Private Universe"". I like the tribal sound of the log drums. Whenever I see the clip I think of John Wyndham's novel ""The Chrysalids"". Probably because of that eerie wasteland and the strange people who inhabit it. It has Neil walking through the Badlands. My only complaint is that this album didn't include ""Chocolate Cake"" and ""Now We're Getting Somewhere"". ""Chocolate Cake"" is witty and offbeat, ""Now We're Getting Somewhere"" is uplifting and optimistic.It's a shame that Crowded House are no more, but 10 years is a good lifespan for a band. I suppose it's better that they quit while they were ahead, rather than running the risk of slipping into mediocrity and stagnation. But with Neil's writing abilities and the talents of the other members, this would have been unlikely."
3,good info,there's knowledge to learn and you can from from this book most of the address has change but i am sure some will forward your letter. or number
5,Remarkable and gorgeous,"A celebratory triumph of a poet, songwriter, and performer who embodied a love of life, good company, melody, and the beauty of women and words. Bethania's voice is as remarkable as Vinicius's twin talents for poetry and the pleasures of love. This album somehow manages to out-ballad her great career of balladeering, AND have more energy and pleasure in the ""up"" sambas as well. Superb and varied arrangement throughout, among the best in modern MPB.I could listen to Mulher, Sempre Mulher and Tarde em Itapua all afternoon. Actually, I have!"
5,"a must for Vinicius, Maria Bethania and Maria Joao Pires lovers",Maria Bethania in her greatest days. Vinicius de Morais in his most emotional words.The fabulous meeting of one of the greatest classic piano player and most inspirated woman Maria Joao Pires with bossa nova
4,A Youthful Maria,Enjoy listening to this old recording..Maria Bethania is an incredible musician and performer..and it is very nice to hear her do the songs of one of her mentors..the inimitable Vinicius de Moraes..
5,Super cute and baby loves it!,"My baby loves giraffe and she has a lot of little plush animals in giraffe so naturally she was very drawn to this ""buddy"" upon first sight. Like other reviews have mentioned, the backpack function is nonexistent, but thats ok with me since I didn't buy this as a backpack for her. My daughter loves it and it looks comfortable on her so I'm giving it a 5 star!"
4,Cute,"I bought this as a present so I cant testify to its use, but it does look cute and well finished. Harness straps are rather thin, but all in all it does look like a fun backpack rather than a dog's leash and the girl who got it loved it."
1,I received off-white color bunny,"Obviously, it is not off-white in the picture. The off-white one is not as cute as the one in the picture. I am very disappointed about this purchase. Now, I feel the shipping experience is not as good as two years ago on Amazon. In hence, the return service is not convenient any more. I guess I should go to local stores than shop on amazon."
3,It's ok,"I wish this harness had the ability to hook the ""handle"" on the side for when my son is walking next to me. Also, forget the pocket - I don't even know why it's there (tiny). I also wish you could take off the ""leash"" and use it wrist to wrist."
4,Does its job,"Cute, pretty sturdy, of course the daughter didn't like it much, but that was expected. Worth the money."
4,It's cute but only if your toddler will let you use it,I only gave this a four star because I haven't been able to use it. Everytime I put it on my daughter it's like all hell breaks loose. I guess if she did wear it I'd have no complaints.
2,It is cute but I don't use it,My child went instantly ballistic when I attached the leash and did not calm down for two hours.
2,Where's the backpack?,"The first thing my 18-month son did when he saw the Buddy Monkey was to give it a big hug. My first reaction, however, was one of slight confusion... where's the backpack? It looks great but this claims to be a 2-in-1 harness / backpack ""for growing travellers"" but this isn't a backpack at all! It just has a tiny velcro pocket that you can't put anything in, except maybe a pacifier (which would drop out). I haven't tried it out yet, but I just wanted to say that the description is misleading: this is simply a (cute and practical) harness."
1,Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Bunny,Not such a great product and not worth the money! It's too big and bulky and my little girl does not like it at all.
3,okay,very cool product for harnessing the kids if you're going to a big public place. my kids like to play with it andpull each other around. the monkey got a hole in the stitching pretty quickly so I guess it's not designed for crazy playing!
5,Excellent product,"I recently used this at the airport for my young son. He absolutely loved being able to run around without having to hold onto my hand! The harness fit perfectly. I had purchased two different brands just to see which one worked better, and I'm so glad I did! The other brand had a nice roomy backpack for toys or snacks, but the harness kept coming up around my son's neck. This one fit perfectly and never once attempted to strangle my son. I would say the only thing wrong with the product is that they say it comes with a backpack. Yeah, if you consider a small slit an adult can barely stick a finger into a backpack then sure, it's a backpack. But as a harness/leash, this is a really nice product. My son also loved to cuddle with the giraffe on the plane."
3,"Good product, unwilling child!","It's just that simple, your child makes the ultimate choice whether he will be willing to walk with the monkey strapped to his back. If your child is willing, it's a great product, looks and feels nice and easy for the parent to use. Good luck!"
5,Great product.. As advertised..,"This is acute little Bag. My son loves it so much, sometimes he just wants to put it while at home."
5,"Wonderful harness, but not really much of a backpack","This harness is adorable and works great. I tried other harnesses with my daughter and she hated them. She loves this one! The body is mostly padding with only a little velcro closure pocket on the back. I guess you could stick a little snack or ID cards in there, but if you are looking for a full backpack you'll be disappointed. I didn't care that much and I'm so happy with it in every other way that I think it still deserves 5 stars."
5,17 month old asks to wear her piggy backpack,My 17 month old asks to wear this backpack. I just used this at Seaworld and she loved being able to walk around. I admit that I was against using these until I had a second child that is super active and thinks it's funny to run away and hide from mom. Great quality and soft. Super cute. It got a little dirty and I easily spot cleaned with soap and water. highly recommend
5,Much more than I expected,"I bought this product thinking it would just serve a very practical purpose.. As soon as my daughter saw it, she fell in love with it. She doesnt think it as something restraining at all. She even goes to bed to sleep with it.. Plus, we can walk around the mall, the park without any worries! I love it!"
4,cute,"I really like this harness, it's cute, but I was hoping for more of a backpack, there's an opening in the back, but there's no room to put anything more than a piece of paper because the stuffing takes all the space, so my daughter can't really carry anything in it.She loved it the first time because we told her it was a backpack like daddy's, but then after a day at the zoo of being pulled around when she tried to run away, now she's scared of it, but that's not the products fault, and I'll still keep trying.It is very cute, and seems to be well manufactured."
3,Ok Movie,This talks about the making of the Corvette ZO6. The Program is only 20 min. long and it could have gone ito more depth for the price. i think it is not worth the $30 price tag.
4,An enjoyable and fun workout!,"This is the fourth Denise Austin video I have tried and so far it one of my favorites. I liked that the video was split into two sections and had a lot of variety in the moves. I don't know how effective the aerobics in the first section were for me--I would have liked more intensity and a faster pace, but the second half got me into a sweat! The scenery was a nice change from a usual gym, but I wish the camera had stayed focused entirely on her rather than moving at strange angles. Overall, it was still a good workout and I think I will definitly try some more of her videos!"
4,Great workout and a must have!,There are two parts to this tape. The first is a very low impact aerobics and the second combines weight lifting and aerobics. The first part of the tape is kind of confusing. She does not do the steps slowly at first. The second part is great. I do agree with other viewers that her warm up and cool down are way to short!!
1,More like poor dance instruction then aerobics,This video is extremely hard to follow. Denise Austin gives little instruction before going into different moves. Most of the first half is dance moves like the cha-cha and box step. Not what I was looking for. I will not buy another Denise Austin video.
3,Not Half Bad ;-),"This video has two different workouts, the first one is all aerobics and a bit confusing, the second workout is 3 minutes of aerobics alternated with 1 minute of weights, and is much easier to follow than the first workout. Plus, with the first workout you need some extra floor space, but the second one can be done in a small area. I enjoy the tape for the second workout, but I can not recomend the first workout!"
1,Are you KIDDING!,"My roommates and I saw this video and decided to give it a try... I could not believe that this was seriously a workout video and not a spoof! The first half is a ridiculously monotonous set of endless cha-cha and side-to-side moves that are boring and ineffective.The second half works you harder, but is still cheesy and consists of bad moves. Denise Austin says many motivating things, but the exercise just doesn't meet her level of enthusiasm.I have never written a review for Amazon before, but after I did this ""workout"" I knew I had to write one for this video and tell you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not for beginners!,"As a beginner, I found this video difficult to keep up with - the pace is extremely fast and the movements are too advanced for someonme just starting out. I would recommend the fitness video ""Callenetics"" for beginners. By the way, the guy in the second part of the ""Fat Burning"" video looks dazed and confused - that alone speaks volumes."
4,"A great intermediate video, fun music.","This was my second Denise Austin video, I started with ultralight aerobics. After about a month I was ready for this second video. I love the peppier music. I still have to view the video a couple of times before I can keep up with the moves, but it really makes you feel good to realize you're not in the beginning mode anymore. I love the fact that there's 2 workouts, each only 30 minutes including warmup and cooldown. I can still get to work on time!!"
5,Great product for the price. Great for dry/sensitive skin!,"I have dry skin that needs constant moisture and this during the day time really does the trick, its also great for sensitive skin since it is unscented and does not have a lot of ingredients in it that could irritate the skin. I picked this stuff at the 99 cent store of all places in Los Angeles when I ran out of my department store moisturizer and it actually works better! Vitamin E is such a great ingredient and really has SO many benefits.This product works well for me as a in the day, at night I like to wear it with the vitamin e oil layered over for extra moisture, but if you have oily/normal skin, the product on its own should do you just fine."
3,Disappointed But Hopeful,"Hopefully this product will turn out to be beneficial....can't comment on that yet since I just received it. However, the big disappointment comes in opening the 2 jars I bought and finding that maybe, if combined, they might equal one. Since both jars were the same inside I don't think this was a conincidence. It was as if there was a divider put down the center when they were filled and half the jar got the cream and the other half remained empty. :("
5,A Splendid Little Collection,"As you are no doubt aware, there is quite a range of Croce collections for purchace. But unquestionably this is the best for the price. It touches on the main hits, but also hints some of his less-known material. For a beginner to the Croce fan kingdom, I strongly recommend this collection as being a good first choice."
4,"Its's OK, but not as good as the others...","The jedi apprentice seires books have always been my favorite, but for some reason, this book has not. I think it foucused too much on Thal's death rather than getting straght to the point. The story outline was very uncomfortable, because you didn't know which person is good and bad until the very end, which kept me quite nervous. I read these book in an hour. I sure wish it could be longer. May the force be with you always."
2,Not as good as the other JA books,"The Jedi Apprentice books have been, for the most part, decent. Obviously written for a younger teen audience, adults who love the Star Wars universe could still find some enjoyment in reading these. 'The Only Witness' isn't a very good book. The story is cobbled together last minute and the plot is totally uninvolving. It may have something to do with Watson coming off a multi-book story arc that was very good, and this book comes off as a sad epilogue. The very fact that there was a birthday party in the SW universe just didn't seem right."
3,Not one of her bests.,"I have read almost all of Landis's books and have liked them all, but I thought this one had a slow plot. I did like her characters. Landis has a way of making her characters came alive."
3,Where are the Pirates?,"It should be called ""Patriots and Portraits"". I have the book and went to see the show, but the title is a misnomer. You will be very disappointed if you are looking for N. C. Wyeth's pirate paintings. The are no Pirate paintings. The N.C. Wyeth paintings are mainly war and patriotic painting. The Jamie Wyeth paintings are mainly portraits of patriots."
4,We need the pirates.,"This video is very close to being great, but I wish the producers would update it with N.C.Wyeth's pirate paintings, and Jamie Wyeth's new painting ""Night Vision.""I bought the video ""Patriots and Pirates"" because it seems to fit in with the theme of Liberty against the Law that my English composition classes was studying. The beginnings of liberty on sailing ships, the American Revolution, and the modern take on patriotism: all these appear in Howard Pyle, N.C.Wyeth, and Jamie Wyeth's work. Jamie Wyeth called this video ""Pirates and Patriots,"" which seems to have more of a ring to it. Please make a new version with the pirates, to complete what was a great idea for a video."
3,Princess Wand,"I did not get this for a toy/gift to child. I got it to use for fun at work because sometimes I think coworkers think that my department is full of wizards and witches.....or that we do have a magic wand...which we could use in order to get all the work done. Every now and then when they come in ask if we can do this ""right away"" I pick it up and use it......good for a laugh and to ease some stress"
3,MID 70'S,"PROGRESSIVE ROCK FROM ENGLAND IN THE MID-70'S, MUCH IN THE STYLE OF SOFT MACHINE. GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. HAD THESE ALBUMS WHEN THEY CAME OUT."
4,They work,They work well for me when I'm using power tools or lawn equipment. I had a pair for several years and was happy with them until they snapped in half last winter. Because they were comfortable I bought a new pair and am happy again. I gave four stars instead of five because they broke.
4,LIVE.......finally,"This is the album Apple failed to release. A live album in 1973 would have helped the group's public standing as they left Apple to join Warner Brothers. A ""Best Of"" album wouldnt have hurt either and probably would have made Apple lots of money. But it didnt happen so we had to wait years for a Badfinger ""LIVE"" release. I'm glad Joey had the tapes and I'm glad he released them. I dont care about the overdubs because the over all sound is good and was done as a legitimate release would be. I think alot of people missed out because they were too busy analyzing it instead of listening to it. The only counterpart is the ""BBC"" disc which really does have inferior sound and lousy artwork. So thanks Joey, for a Badfinger LIVE release. Some of us appreciate it."
2,A Remix Gone Wrong,"Joey Molland released this CD in the 1990's after remixing and overdubbing the tapes. The fault here is he tried to modernize the sound too much. Live Badfinger would have sounded much better left in the context of the 1970's. The biggest problem to me is the drum sound; it's far too loud, too echoey and reeks of drum samples grafted on in places. Joey also overdubbed his lead vocals and guitar parts, a common fix on live albums. Though out the disc I was drawn to listen to the remixing rather than the original Badfinger performance. Hence my two star rating."
3,Only for fanatical fans.,"Overdubbing and resequencing do not save this limp outing by the original band members in Cleveland during 1974. I am unsure if the audience is less enthusiastic than the band but, this is far from a rousing performance and sounds more like a rehearsal.Perhaps it was playing Cleveland or perhaps the band was about to unravel but there is little energy. Although the performance is competent it is not something you will play more than once unless a fanatical fan.If it difficult to believe the source is the original 16-track master tape which Joey Molland kept at his house until 1990. It should have remained there under lock and key. But, than again, fans would have always believed that it was the lost holy grail rather than evidence confirming the crime."
2,Would you buy a second hand car off Moland ?,"Everyone interested in Badfinger and who wish to read more about this album and resulting court case and Molland`s dishonesty ( he and his wife drew up an agreement with Ryko so that they would receive all royalties from this album rather than share equally with all of the band`s other living and dead members families ) should read the judges`s summing up - you can find it on the web - search using - badfinger music v evans 2000.It`s bad enough that an earlier court case gave Molland and the others a share of all Ham & Evans royalties , taking money from their beneficiaries. Imagine a judge telling Lennon&McCartney; instead of the 100% you are getting you are only going to get 35% of your songwritingroyalties . The remainder will be shared 5 ways - one share to each band member and the manager. On top of that Molland had the indecency of getting up on stage to accept an award as co-writer of Without You.Molland must have had training from Polley."
2,"Average, good in parts","Cliched comic about an amateur heist gone -wrong that nevertheless manages to raise the pulse rate in some scenes. The art is a sort of poor imitation of Sin City, and the action confusing at times. The plot is really convoluted and the ending is so bad, it beggars belief."
3,Essays and addresses,A selection of essays and addresses published that provide a coherent theory for the sociological study of primitive society. Each of the papers presented was written for a particular occasion but have some measure of unity as being written from a particular theoretical point of view.
5,Outstanding,"Bill Gaither's videos all seem to be excellent in every respect.Logically paced, very well photographed, and just generally very enjoyable.The only problem seems to be checking to make sure you don't repeat, and order the same thing again."
1,"Gaither videos, where are they?",I ordered thses products on November 23. I find it impossible to review them because today it is December 23 and I have not received them yet.
3,"Mediocre Early 1990's Reunion Concert Featuring, ""Through My Eyes.""","I really wanted to like this reunion disc of 1960's British acid pop band The Creation but they play my all time favorite tune, Through My Eyes, like they didn't give a damn about themselves or their audience, although other songs played seem to vary in quality of performance. Recommended only for die-hard fans."
4,An enjoyable book.,"I purchased this book among several others from Amazon to give to my grandchildren (preschool and elementary school-aged) in hopes of instilling in them a curiosity about the Great Southwest and a knowledge about the Native Americans who live there, We read the book together and had a good time doing it, The text was just about the right level for their age groups, and they were able to comprehend the illustrations well. I was hoping for a book that could be read and enjoyed by us all, and I was not disappointed in that hope."
5,Knew the stories growing up,I owned this book as a child and recall them so vividly to this day to tell of Coyote's adventures. They're fun stories and I'm purchasing them for my nephew who is in the perfect age range for the book. Cheers!
4,Mother's care in the extreme,"This charming film is not an award-winner, yet it's curiously amusing. Never underestimate the power of a mother trying to protect her child. Poor little April has learned that any attraction to the opposite sex triggers her ability to start fires in the oddest places such as potted plants and a date's car. Somehow she can't resist her persistent childhood friend, Andy. The battle between Andy and April's mother (Barbara Harris) for April's loyalty creates unexpected laughs and an admiration for both characters. Like love, this film is irresistible."
3,VERY SWEET QUIRKY FILM,"I LOVE this movie, it has always stuck w/ me. It has a its own completely believable logic. The Mom is hilariously overprotective and a master of rationalization. Myrink is great trying cope w/ being a teenager who is also a fire hazard. The hapless young man (a competitive ping pong player) is skeptical, but dogged in his pursuit. Wallace Shawn (!) has a small but fun role. Every person I've introduced to this movie has loved it. Great teen movie, no naughty parts. It contains the funniest no-sex no nudity shower scene ever!"
3,Michelle Meyrink fans might enjoy,"Mom (Barbara Harris) employs a pyromaniac to persuade daughter (Michelle Meyrink)that love can be lethal. Mildly amusing,at best, although if you're looking for an inoffensive video that can be enjoyed by most of the family, this isn't a bad choice. Michelle Meyrink, something of a minor cult actress for nerds, handles the limited requirements of her role well.Andy: William O'Leary. Ken: James Nardini. Chuck Martinez directed."
5,"Like the ocean, Swells; Curls; Calm; Waiting for the Break","Swirling like Bronwyn's violin...Curling like Simon's voice, rising, increasing tempo (is it Mick Harvey? is is Alex Hacke? What causes this perfect flow?) The beat follows the natural ""squaring the circle"" momentum; I wish it would never end; it builds, it peaks, it crashes, it ebbs, and it goes again! Truly a missed masterpiece!"
4,Works pretty good,"I read on other reviews that it can harm healthy skin, but I haven't had that problem. It's amazing how the callus just rolls off with the file. It doesn't say how long to go between treatments, so i waited at least 3 days. It definitely takes more than one application to completely get rid of the calluses. The lotion does help keep feet smooth. It's the best product I've found and I will reorder."
3,Be careful using it,"It does work as described. I used it once but am reluctant to use it again.It is probably best used with another person applying the product. My experienceindicates if you accidentally get it on good skin, it will eat good skin as well.This happened to me and it took a week for my body to repair the damage.I did rinse well but apparently the damage was already done.As for the callus, it ate right though that and made it very easy to remove.Just be careful. If you can NOT see the callus area well definitely get someone to help."
3,better than the foam ones,"These are great when you first put them in. And for my purposes, they are fine. I put them on for a few seconds while using a tool and take them off while preparing for the next cut. However, if you need to wear them for more than a few minutes, they start to hurt a bit. The earpieces themselves are fine, but the band clamps a bit too hard for me. That said, they come with extra earpieces and they're washable, so they're leaps and bounds above the more expensive AOS band that I had before."
1,worst purchase on amazon ever,"the idea of interchangeable plugs was a good one, but the pegs to hold them on break very easily. not like I am a big strong guy who wasn't being careful easy either. More like the plug gets bent a little pulling off the head band and oops, its broken. Won't buy these again."
1,Garbage,"Ear piece fell off right away, ear plug material too soft. Takes too much effort to get inserted into ear canal. Waste of money."
2,Inexpensive holster,"You are getting what you pay for with this item. The build quality seems adequate. I have had mine for about a year, but, I have rarely used it because I do not feel like my weapon is secure in this holster. The M7x matrix flops around too much while carrying an XD and does not conceal easily. On the plus side, a Taurus PT145 will fit and does not seem to bounce around as much."
1,terrible toy!,"This toy is terrible!Frustrating to put together and to play with. It slides fall off when you put a car on them, the elevator is so flimsy and cheaply made that it doesn't slide up and down well and the launcher thing wouldn't stay on for even one use.This toy is going in the trash!"
1,Do not buy Key Heads City Speed Shop,"This toy is flimsy and poorly made. If I could give 0 stars I would! I would not take another one if it were given to me for free. My 3.5 yr old son was immensely disappointed with it because the shorter slide NEVER stayed on. If you touch this toy, the shorter slide falls off. Each time my son tried to roll the car down the slide, the slide fell off. The elevator is almost impossible to move as well. Very quickly he vacated this toy to find one that he could actually play with. It went back in the box 5 minutes after I finally assembled it. And speaking of assembling it, the directions are non-worded and confusing, making putting it together a frustrating chore. I purchased it online from Little Tikes and have asked for a refund. I will go to a store where I can actually see what I am buying before purchasing another LT toy. Stick with the Fisher Price garage."
4,Compelling and instructive,"This collection of memories conveys the excitement, zeal, possibilities, problems and limitations of Guevara's ""guerilla warfare"" strategy as it was practiced in the Sierra Maestra. At times, one can almost hear Guevara wheezing as he traverses the rugged terrain. It is, in general, light on ideological substance and heavy on battlefield drama. A classic nonetheless..."
4,Enlightening,Che goes through memories of the Revolutionary War in Cuba. His writing style is engaging and interesting.
4,Once Upon a Lily Pad,My kids were interested and entertained by this book. They loved the illustrations and it gave them a great introduction to the art of Claude Monet.
3,Good Basic Book,"Having sewn for most of my life, but never used a serger, the book was a very good overview and basic introduction. It has been very useful as a reference guide to use along side the machine manual."
5,Serger,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter - and she loved it. She has just started sewing, but has gotten very good already. Does a lot of sewing for her 1 1/2 year old baby girl and has started a craft blog and sells things on Etsy. I will try to update her use of the machine as she uses it more. So far - so good!"
5,Fantastic Book,"This could be called the Serger Bible! It has so much information and is so well written. I hesitated buying it because it was published in 1998. I thought it might be outdated, but it isn't. I'd highly recommend it."
4,The Complete Serger Handbook,"This book is very informative. The book is filled with colorful photos on each page. The author discusses the different types of stitches and explains how to adjust tensions for a balanced stitch. There is information on how to stitch corners, curves, rolled hems, flatlocking, and how to correct problems when stitching. The back of the book has information devoted to troubleshooting. I think that Chris James wrote this book for people like me who love having a serger, but are still learning how to work with one."
4,Eye opening,I wanted to find out just all the possibilities that a Serger could give me on my sewing projects. I believe I will be ordering one soon.
4,Very infomative!,"When I first got a serger, and this book at the same time- I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. The first time I read the book, I was just as lost as I was before I had read it. Then I worked at my serger for a little bit, and read the book again- and then it started to make sense. The book has a lot of pictures with descriptions that help a lot (once you have an idea as to what you're doing)."
4,Great book to learn the basics about serging!,"My sister gave me her used Bernette Serger -- thank you Sis! Until I read this book, I knew absolutely nothing about how to operate a serging machine and my sister didn't have the mfr's instruction book. The book helped me to understand the threading process, the tension knobs, and about what type of thread and needles to buy. At the beginning of the book, the author attempts to discuss different machines and then abandons the idea as the book progresses. However, the concepts and techniques are pretty much universal. After reading the book and using the threading guide stamped on the machine, I had enough confidence to make a throw pillow -- and it turned out looking store bought! I am now hooked on using sergers!"
2,Essentially a surger manual (good for beginners),"I gave this book 2 stars because it's more of a manual than anything. If you're a beginner, this would be a good investment (for a beginner this would be a 4 star book). It shows you how to care for, adjust and otherwise maintain your surger. It also shows different thread types as well as types of accessories and how to use them. If you already know what you're doing, save your money."
4,Why don't more people use irony today in theological writing?,"Using high irony, detailed research, and quoations from his opponents in their own words, Blaise Pascal wrote eighteen letters in France during the Seventeenth century attacking some of the moral abuses and laxities of the Jesuit priests. While his letters were widly distributed and read, the letters were condemned by the King and by the Pope as heresy, before later, after reforms were enacted, being praised by a later king and later Pope.The style and content is very similar to Soren Kierkegaard's Attack Upon Christendom.Though irony is not often used today as a method for theological inquiry and challenge, I would love to see it implemented more, as it makes for great reading while at the same time making powerful and pointed thelogical critiques of one's opponents."
3,Should have been more songs,"With I AM A WILD PARTY the listener only get a brief taste of Kim Mitchell's live show. The two studio tracks are great also but I expected more. I would not jump to blame Kim Mitchell for this as I know what kind of garbage records companies pull us, the buyers and fans."
1,QPS Provides NO TECH SUPPORT!,"I bought an m5-es from qps about five weeks ago and immediately ran into problems. None of the included software ran on my brand new powerbook 15"", and my PC refused to recognize the drive. I immediately emailed QPS tech support, and have sent two more reminder emails in the last month -- with no replies whatsoever :(((Running external hard drives is not entirely trivial, so unless you are sure you know what you are doing and don't care about included software I'd give this product a pass..."
5,The Best Adam Curtis Documentary Made...,"This is incredibly relavant to modern American society as well as most other ""Democratic"" societies. In this documentary, Adam Curtis explores the link between Fear Politics, Radical Muslims & NeoConservatives. He makes some amazing links between all three using alot of stock footage and public domain video clips.NeoConservatism is a political philosophy that emerged in the United States that supports the use of American economic and military power to bring democracy and human rights to other countries. The irony in this idea is that you have to violate human rights in order to accomplish it. Those that support it do so by saying that the whole is greater than the one and they use Fear Politics to get others on board. The idea that ""If we don't fight them there, then they will come here..."""
1,Wrong picture,"Hmmm, I don't think that is a moving blanket. Looks more like a garroting wire. Makes you wonder who proofreads these descriptions"
4,A good purchase,"Easy to read and understand. Worth the money if you love to study volcanoes. Great pictures inside, and sturdy back."
5,very good item,Very good item. help catch trout.exactly same as description from seller. Very good seller. Like to help customers. I like the item and like to purchase it from the seller.
4,Enigmatic,"There was much controversy when the album was released.I have always enjoyed Enigma - it is haunting, sensual and relaxing all at the same time.I would buy any album of Enigma before listening to it."
5,Enigma at its best!,"THIS is the album you should get if you want to get a feel for what Romanian Michael Cretu can put together. Splendid, new age-ish at times, but without becoming the classical ""sound of the waves""-type album, soothing and inspiring: these are all ideas that come to my mind when I think of this production.You'll recall song #3, ""Return to Innocence"", I'm sure."
2,Not even the 2nd best!,"In your recent review of ""The Best Enigma Album Of All Time"", I would have to seriously dissagree with your choice. When it comes the the purest thought of pure erotic,neurotic,and sexually stimulating musical lust, nothing beats the very first Enigma CD-MCMXCAD.I call it ""My personal Viagra on Opium"" When the ladies hear its continuous mix of monk chants and hypnotic sexual overtones, just hope your ready for some serious ""lust making"", oops, I meant ""love making"". You Pick."
2,"Newage, it rhymes with sewage","Not bad, but certainly not great.There are some tunes on this CD which are decent. But don't expect great musicianship or composing skills, or even great sound. This is a CD that's made for playing in the background because it just doesn't stand up under scrutiny. The ""lyrics"" on pieces like ""Second Chapter"" are so inane as to almost be a Spinal Tap like parody of the new age music genre. The keyboard sounds are so cliche as to be unlistenable in some places. I mean, if you're not going to use a real Native American cedar flute then at least get a decent synth patch to mimic one.Great for a chill out room at a rave, or if you need something to listen to while shopping for incense and dolphin posters. Beyond that, you'll be better off with Jean-Michelle Jarre."
4,"Great songs, but no respect to intellectual properties","I love this album; however, it's awful when Engima refused to properly acknowledge the singers in ""Return to Innocence"". Those elderly Taiwanese singers deserve respect from Engima, instead of being ripped off."
3,Interesting mix,"While not as impressive as MCMXC aD, Cross of Changes offers an ecclectic mix of popular and more diverse songs."
5,Spell-binding and sexy!,"An outstanding recording by Enigma. This is their best work. It's rythmic, enchanting, at times haunting, and never dull. This wonderful recording can be appreciated by people of all ages and musical taste."
3,Surprise surprise,"The Age of Loneliness is one of my favorite songs, w/o a doubt in my Top Ten. I would be eternally miserable if I didn't have that maxi. Fabulous doesn't begin to describe that song. This album which it is off of for some reason has never made it with me. Maybe because it's a sort of a letdown from his other two or juss the fact I am confused by what he was trying to do hear because this album doesn't have the smashes of the first one. This CD would rate lower if it weren't for Carly's Song. Nothing memorable at all besides it. I suggest either getting the Sliver soundtrack(the best movie album EVER in my opinion) or searching for the CD maxisingle. You can find it out there if you look hard enough"
3,"Interesting, but lacks humanity.","This CD features a number of good songs but they don't gel into a very cohesive album. The singing Indian is very cool in ""Return to Innocence"" but he gets a little old when he can be heard in the background of ""Silent Warrior"" just two songs later. That put a gimicky spin on the whole thing that nearly ruined the whole CD. They should have used him on the hit and just left it at that. ""I Love You ... I'll Kill You"" is probably the best song. It leaves you cold when it's appropriate to do so. Overall, I thought this CD could stand a bit more intensity. It seemes to lack a certain humanity that was right in its grasp, but slipped away. I couldn't help feeling that the production was overseen by robots or something. A few excellent songs, though."
1,Enigma may have 'soul' music but Michael Cretu has no soul,"What can you say of a person who steals his biggest hit (""Return to Innocence"") from the native people of a small country (Taiwan) and gives the singer no credit. This music is contrived and written to ring the cash register."
5,The Table of Inwardness,This book is a great read for those that desire more intimacy in their relationship with Christ. The book arrived on time and in excellence condition.
2,this game was great until toa was released,"now it's just a bad eq clone riddled with timesinks 9hr mob spawns fighting for camps etc..pvp used to be really good. you had a feeling that if you won/lost a fight, it was because you outplayed or were outplayed. now winning losing is just a function of whoever subjected themselves to the largest number of timesinks."
1,Mythic Entertainment will continue to bill your credit card!,"This is just to serve as a warning to those of you who create an account for Dark Age of Camelot. You will be given two choices: 1. Renew for one month @12.95 2. Renew for three months for a reduced price. Well, I opted for the first method and wrongly figured that I would be billed for just a month at a time. Nope! Mythic Entertainment will continue to bill you month after month which I discovered after-the-fact on my credit statement. I had to call their Virginia office to cancel and they are not pleasant to deal with.My rating is based on the amount of money this game ended up costing me versus the level of enjoyment the game provided. Game enjoyment minus amount of $$ spent = 1 star"
4,Excellent Fun for the Casual Gamer,"If you don't have 40 hours a week to spend in front of your computer playing games, Dark Age of Camelot is for you. It is unlike Everquest, which is a wonderful game but has a steep learning curve and does not let you accomplish much if you only have a short time to be online. Dark Age allows casual players to still accomplish a lot with their characters even if they have little time to play. It also is a rich world with wonderful historical and mythological roots."
1,No thanks,"Not a fun game at all. I have 4 level 50 maxed out toons. I have played this game for about 1 year. It is all now being hacked out by cheaters. Therefore I would pass on this game. Enemy players now have the ablity to heal themselves as much as they want. Really makes it sad, a once fun game to play , turns out to be a hack. Oh and if you do get the game and have any issues, have fun! Customer service lacks big time!!!!! I came up missing a really nice staff, 6 days later they got back to me , only to say, sorry we cant do anything. Also if somone on this amazon review says its a great game, maybe thats because they have a few to sell ya!!!! They dont want ya to know the real deal!!!"
1,Dark Ages of Camelot,"This game is horrid, if you want a real MMORPG, you'd play everquest, mearly all I have to say. 1 star hands down."
5,Letter on Toleration,"This should be given to every person walking into a church, synagogue, mosque, ect. This essay is a must read, especially in todays world with people coming into contact with different types of people daily!"
1,Unfunny & uninteresting,"This movie did nothing for me. It was slow, dull & uninteresting. And definitely NOT FUNNY."
1,Change To Another Movie,"Joe Mantegna and Don Ameche star in this drama/ thriller/ comedy directed by the overrated David Mamet. Like most Mamet movies, ""Things Change"" tries to clever, unusual and oh-so-surprising, but unfortunately the overall effort is nothing more than a dull, tedious and uninspired achievement. The acting is alright and the direction competent enough, yet the plot just drags endlessly and fails to present a memorable and remarkable moment. The last ten minutes are somewhat interesting and present enough dramatic tension, still that doesn`t make for the boring hour that precedes it. ""Things Change"" has little or nothing going for it, delivering an intantly forgettable cinematic experience.There are more compelling things around."
5,Autism Sleep 2,"My Son is also autistic, and I cna't say enough about the liquid melatonin. It helps him fall asleep, keeps him asleep, and helps regulate his mood."
1,Not good if you are just getting started,This book is nothing but an explanation of what comes with Reason 2.5 Its not worth buying if you are new user and want an indepth understanding of the software. Even the manual that comes with the software was better than this book.
5,Hysterically funny!!!,"I laughed & laughed reading this book. The whole thing was funny! It was interesting how Jessica got all excited over meeting her longtime crush, rock singer Johnny Buck. Of course, she & her friends imagine Johnny to be all cool, sophisticated, & ""romantic"" as he APPEARS in his videos & the media. The hilarious part...the REAL Johnny Buck doesn't fit that image at all! Johnny turns out to be not only clumsy, but very childish, immature, & acts like a spoiled teenager. On top of that, he's extremely self-centered & orders his staff around like dogs & yells at them. I wasn't surprised. Another funny & kind of pathetic part was when Johnny falls into on of his childlike snits right before a concert & claims to have a sore throat so he won't be in the concert! I wonder how many singers & rock stars do that in real life. Interesting look at how infatuation images of celebrities often clash with the real person inside, the imperfect human with faults."
2,Not compatible with my camera or not working good,"According with the information of compatibility with cameras, this memorystick was compatible with the sony dcs-s75.When I insert the memorystick, it generates an error: c:13:01. I try with all the recomendations that i find to solve the problem, but i could not figure it out. According to the information on the web, this happens when the memory is not compatible or when it is not working good.I look for information in the scandisk website, and I couldn't find if there exist any compability with my camera. Obviously, I can not recommended."
5,Orchestral jazz for dreaming people,"This CD includes an original orchestration of Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"" and a quasi-suite in 8 movements. I say ""quasi-suite"" because it sounds more like a collection of (great) pieces than like a unified work. However, the composing and orchestration is very, very good. I like the first ""Sketch"" very much, a small soprano sax/piano duo with an impressionistic mood. Then the orchestra comes in and there are at least three or four Sketches that never fail to make me dream.The orchestral personnel is mainly European, but there are a few exceptions, most notably Dave Liebman. The sound is sort of ECM-ish. There is excellent solo work by all the featured soloists, with a special mention for Liebman, guitarist Nguyen-L and pianist Frank Chastanier.Bottom line: you'll definitely like this CD if you like modern jazz (no bebop or Ellington here) like for instance Kenny Wheeler's works on ECM."
2,Disappointed by the color and the works not the concept,"I was most disappointed by the lack of color in the book and by the style and nature of Curtis' paintings. There is a collection of color plates in the center of the book, but unfortunately they didn't relate to the sections I was interested in. Curtis' method probably makes sense but with so many of the illustrations in b&w and the works uninteresting I just couldn't get into it."
5,Totems,"This is a wonderful story for young adults, but because the author never talks down to her audience, a crossover for enjoyable adult reading is possible. The mix of reality and fantasy was well-done so that you never feel the fantasy detracts from the reality of the story. The dialogue is real and never feels forced. It was a very enjoyable book."
2,expect bleak expectations,tawdry tale about a serial sodomist and murderer. poorly written and ploddingly plotted. well below average for the genre.
5,The book is excellent! Worth the read!,"You will love this book! A motivator indeed! Need some ""umph"" to get you going and working on your dreams? This is the book for you. Very short daily thoughts. A busy person will love it."
1,Time for surgery,"I purchased one of these at Best Buy in March 2003. It has been acting up at power on for several weeks now, and now won't even get past the welcome screen. I have noticed that the power LED doesn't come on, and the TV splash screen doesn't come on either. I used to be able to power down and then back on, and that usually worked. Today it refused to do so. I will have to agree with the other reviewers in that this unit is garbage. For all of the electronic user interface designers out there, this could be the quintessential example of what not to do. I give KLH an F for user friendliness. This being my first home theater purchase, I now have a good idea of what to look for as far as features and usability. At least the speakers sound decent and are still in good shape.Now on to the exploratory surgery. Have soldering iron, will travel."
1,Died without notice...,"Nine months ago I thought I was buying a good value product but now I realize that I bought a bomb... The whole system stoped working with a DVD inside. I couldn't manage to open the DVD... Worse, the service center that I am calling does not work anymore... Do not buy from KLH never..."
1,Great Value,"lasted almost 9 months before it died on the welcome screen. Judging by previous reviews, looks like I got the cream of the crop.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KLH!!!"
2,stutters on playback,"While this player recognized and played back DVD-R and DVD-RW, it would stop and stutter at various play points. Very annoying. These same disks play in about five other brands I tested without stutters (Pioneer, Apex, Toshiba...)I got this ...open-box item at a north Seattle Best Buy, but I still have to take it back -- too bad. The price was very good and the surround sound was pretty good."
2,Wow! I think I set the endurance record.,"I bought this set-up in March/April 2003. I managed to make it twice as long as the longest review I've seen on here. 4 years before mine crapped out.Welcome screen of death showed up last week. Was able to salvage my DVD. I've had to take it apart at least once a year b/c it would freeze up with a DVD/CD in it.Trying to reach KLH customer service is like getting a straight answer from the Bush administration. I'll cut my losses and get a quality surround setup. Though honestly, for $149 this really did exceed my (low) expectations."
1,dvd player froze - can we do anything about this?,"I had the same problem as the other reviewers. After 8 months, the dvd player froze on the welcome screen. Can we do anything about this? Given the number of the exact same complaint, it's obviously a design flaw.I tried calling the warranty service number for World Wide Electric, and the number has been busy for hours.Since I have the surround sound speakers set up in a room (and they presumably still work), can I get another dvd player/receiver from another company that I can hook the speakers and woofer into?Thanks in advance for any suggestions: mobarak@spot.colorado.edu"
1,No support or updates for cdrom versions,"I own 8 iFinger cdrom products. I own 2 web purchased products. I have used their products for years. Not anymore. The company selling iFinger no longer supports the cdrom products. If you buy this and own older cdrom iFinger products. They may or may not work together. If you buy a downloaded iFinger product and own cdrom iFinger products they WILL NOT work together. So, why bother? I will be looking for another integrated solution, and iFinger has lost a loyal customer. Beware also of their web products. They control your registration, updates and based on their records of your registration, your ability to use the software you bought. I WILL NOT buy any more iFinger products."
1,Terrible product,The CD-ROM would not load properly and had to be returned for credit (which Amazon honored promptly).
4,A useful balance of size and substance,"It's a compact book that covers Classical Latin as well as anything else of like size. It might prove to be a little lost upon beginners--the Latin-Latin, while setting a context and authority, isn't significant to novices. Also, novices enjoy English-Latin sections in their dictionaries, which this lepidus libellus doesn't attempt. Still: little, useful, thorough, cheap!"
5,best author,"Elisa Kleven is my favorite kids book author. we have all of her books. ""paper princess"" is our favorite, but they are all delightful. Ernst is a fun little guy that appears in a few of her books"
5,My son's favorite book!,"Certainly one of the most beautifully illustrated children's books of all time! Ernst's question ""What if..."", the night before his birthday, takes the reader and the listener on a magical, sparkling trip of beautiful detail and wonder. When it's time for Ernst to fall asleep, his mother's comforting presence assures that his real birthday will be as special as his daydreams. Children will stare for hours at the magical creatures rejoicing in Ernst's world. This tale is comfort food for the eyes and a perfect birthday gift!"
3,This book is not the object of MY affection....,"After ripping through The Object of My Affection in the space of two days, I eagerly purchased Stephen McCauley's other books. I was a bit disappointed in The Easy Way Out, as the characters aren't really likeable, and their situations are somewhat self-inflicted. As in real life, it's a bit difficult to feel sympathy for people who bring on their own problems, and reading about it certainly doesn't pass MY time well. Perhaps I shouldn't be so negative... I mean, I didn't MIND the book, but I loved his first book so much, that I expected the same. I was wrong."
2,Disappointing from McCauley,I loved Object of my Affection to the point that I would come home and expect to find the characters in my apartment. I laughed so much during The Man of the House that the staff of the Sun Princess theartened to throw me overboard. But this clinker was really disappointing. I didn't find Patrick sympathetic at all. A feeble attempt compared to his other two novel-comic masterpieces.
1,"Boring, boring, boring.","The reviews for this book made me want to read it, so I did. It was very hard to finish because it is so boring. The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping SOMETHING would happen by the end. But nothing worth mentioning did."
5,All love them,All my friends that receive them now wear them and feel more connected to each other. Keep the work up
1,"Poor compat, worse support","Bought this for my son at Costco. Tried installing it on 3 different PCs, each of which exceeded the minimum recommended settings by far.In all three, the program installed without a hitch and would not run.I then tried contacting tech support and relaying the detailed diagnostic log information. They were less than helpful and suggested ""fixes"" that broke compatability with other programs - and still did not work. I will be returning this software this week and purchasing Fritz and Chesster."
1,It doesn't run at all,"I installed the software and it doesn't run at all! Instead, my computer is down whenever I try to run it. The manufacturer doesn't even give us a toll-free number to contact them."
2,ok chess program with good graphics.,This software is mostly intended for ocassional chess players. Younger or even older people who are just learning chess will like it. However for serious chess freaks like myself will go somewhere else. The mouse control and movement of your pieces is very sluggish. It doesn't have the option to open .pgn (portable game notaion) or other types of database files. I recommend this ONLY for people who just started learning the game. ...
4,Makes chess fun!,"Majestic Chess is a great game, especially for people who are interested in learning chess but enjoy playing video games. The unique Chess Adventure mode in this game caught my attention so I bought the product, and am very pleased with it! It has rekindled my interest in chess and made learning the game fun. The graphics are great (the best of any chess program I've seen, especially the 3D boards) and there are plenty of other features in the game including online play, an easy to use interface, and a strong chess engine that will challenge anyone. Of course its not as feature rich as a more advanced program like Chessmaster or Fritz, but for a beginner or intermediate player looking for something different, or someone who just wants to have fun and learn the game, its perfect!"
3,good vs evil,"This book was alright but what always bothers me about Salinger is that he always makes his characters either good guys or bad guys. We have the almost mystical precouis good guys,like the glass family, and then theres everyone else,the narrowminded phonys. In real life people are both good and bad and have many failings,weaknesses and strengths. Personally I find the glass family to be terribly unrealistic and annoying.Catcher in the Rye was a much better book."
3,An OK Book,"I had read Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" as a recommendation from my parents. I really liked it so I read ""Nine Stories"" hoping it would be as good. Many of the stories were interesting enough, but the others were hard to get through. All of the nine stories were very well written with lots of detail, just dull. Maybe short stories aren't my thing because I wouldn't read it again. If you like other J.D. Salinger books, I think you should read it."
5,-,"Short stories that cannot be beat. Salinger beats Faulkner's fictional county tales by only writing stories peripheral to his family. ""Down in the Dinghy"" is one of my favorites."
4,New Endings or None at All,"Salinger was obviously a great storyteller, but the endings to most of his stories are too glamorously shocking to be shocking at all. A much better book of short stories would be Nine Stories minus all the endings. Despite the ending, ""Teddy"" is perhaps the best short story I have ever read."
4,Bought this for my boyfriend,"It came in time, was in great condition, and he loved it ! He says it's a great book and really liked it as a gift"
4,Eons beyond the Catcher in the Rye,"I've been apprehensive about Salinger since thoroughly loathing the Catcher in the Rye in high school. But what was so eye-rollingly bland to me about Holden Caulfield and his extended pity party is also what makes Salinger an incredible short story writer. He's able to create these small, delicate little domestic portraits of post-war Americans that have this precise, lighter-than air quality. And he writes little kids better than just about anyone. Yet these stories are often grounded by this dark, emotionally damaged concern which is always there, just past the reach of the almost hermetically sealed dialogue. I'll take Salinger the short story writer over Salinger the novelist any day."
4,good good good stuff,"i kinda cheated with this book out of my complete attention, because i read each story in between a novel, and the novels i read are quite striking in contrast to the short stories of this book. I enjoyed the book though, but not as much as i potentially could have. i probably enjoyed the `laughing man`, and `down at the dinghy` most, but i dont know what all the fuss with a `perfect day for bananafish` is about."
2,"Some Good stories, but quite a let down overall","I think that some of the stories in this book were very good, the best being A perfect Day for Banana Fish, but after the first 3 stories, it went down hill. After reading Catcher in the Rye, I was hooked on salinger, but these stories were not short stories, they just got longer and longer, and some of them I found hard to finish because they became either too complicated or they just lost my interest. An okay book, but I know that this definatly isnt Salinger's greatest works."
4,"A step below ""catcher""","Salinger showed signs of the brilliance that was used througout ""Catcher in the Rye."" Although interesting, many of the stories failed to capture me the way ""Catcher"" did. However, his ability to capture many of the experiences, feelings, fears, and wonders of people continues to impress me. If you liked his other works, read it, but don't expect too much."
2,High expectations - did not deliver,"I really enjoyed Salinger's more popular Catcher in the Rye and wanted even more of Salinger to get my hands on. Quirky (as usual), despressed, and anti-climatic I did not enjoy Nine Stories. Would not even recommend as a light read to a friend."
5,What can I say about greatness?,"This book was an inseperable part of who I was when I was 19. I think that says a lot, but who really knows."
5,disturbingly beautiful,"This book is everything - the truth, the truth, and thetruth. From the beginning with ""The perfect day..."" to thebreathtaking ""Teddy"", it just hits straight to the point. It is completely perfect."
5,An Amazing Reflection on the Human Condition,"Salinger's Nine Stories provoke an amazing, insightful debate inside one's own mind about the nature of humanity. The imagery and symbolic connections play an important role in this thought provoking masterpiece. I would suggest this book to anyone who wishes to persue the basic idea of existence."
5,He is the Master,"What an amazing book! You just have to love it. Everything you expect from Salinger only more. As the last of his books avilable here I have read it is most definatly the best. If only we could meet these people - Teddy? If you have not read it yet then do, but savour every line!"
4,a few out of nine,"i like salinger, really. the catcher in the rye was nothing short of a masterpiece. but i think he had trouble living up to his first novel. most of the stories were touching, but could have gone further with their plots, for they all had mostly bland cliffhanger endings. my personal favorite was teddy, but there were other good ones as well. my response to this novel, in short, is that since there are nine stories written by a very original author in this one book, you'll at least find one to be enjoyable."
4,One of my favorite works...,"This is my favorite Salinger work. Far surpasses ""Catcher"" if you ask me.These are (you guessed it....nine) short stories. Most are quite dark and have an excellent ability to instill the reader with brooding/uneasy feelings.Take the opener....""A perfect day for bananafish"". This is what lead me to J.D. Salinger, and particularly this work. As an aside, and a piece of factoid--take it for whatever its worth--this work inspired The Cure to record the song ""Bananafishbones."" But, this story is kind of a creepy, weird little story with an ending that just blew me away. (No pun intended for those who have read it.)And so it goes, from that one forward. The mood has been set. One after the other, dark, rather cold, stories. But, it's all painfully good.All in all, a good collection of stories from one of the greatest American authors."
4,Nine Stories More Than Just Bananafish,"Nine Stories is a famous collection. ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" has lost none of its power to shock. To experience the vitality and humor of Seymour's conversation with the little girl on the beach - the ending is sad and inexplicable, and of course the Glass family is terribly wounded as a result. This story is a must-read, but so is ""For Esmé with Love and Squalor"" (a moving story about traumatic stress and the healing power of love,) and ""Teddy,"" a unique and funny story about a 10-year old genius who has a very old soul."
2,I couldn't get into this book,"A friend I work with loaned it to me because he adores Salinger and I just couldn't get into it! It was for me, kind of boring and I hate to say that because I adore the classics and I really, really wanted to like it. I recommend someone else read it just because it is a classic. I personally hated it! D+"
2,No thanks,"I loved The Catcher in the Rye, so I decided to read this book (I've just started Franny and Zooey) but this book disappointed me. The stories are just too complicated for me, and they seem to be pointless. You know nothing about anything when you start this book, so it's a complete waste of time, in my opinion. I guess maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to read such a complex piece of work, but nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,"Yuk, Yuk and Double Yuk","I absolutely detested all of the stories in this volume! All of them were dreary and gloomy for no particular reason, and after I finished each one, I was still at a loss at to what Salinger was trying to tell me. He gives no reason for his extreme pessimism but simply paints everyone and everything in a very negative light. Salinger is a powerful writer, but compared to the Catcher In The Rye, this book is just garbage."
1,What's New?,"The book Nine Stories, is repetative in its theme's. There is no sense of digression, only confussion. Each of the stories has a main theme in commom which basically sums up to be around negativity; there is always something happeneing to make the story very dissappointing Or negative. Someone dies, someone gets hurt, something bad happens to affect someone else.If I was to really summarize these stories as a whole, i would say that it is a very long poem. I love to write poems and i get that feeling from each story."
5,My favorite collection of stories. Period.,"Some are stronger than others, but this is collectively the most wonderful series of short stories I have ever read. They are even more enjoyable when you know the connections between certain stories (and their interlacing with other stories and novellas of Salinger's)."
4,The Greatest Story About Love Ever,"Salinger's stories are all exceptional and I enoyed every one of them, but The Laughing Man stands out in this book. It is the best story about love that I've ever read. It isn't a ""love story"" but rather a story about Love.John Gedsudski, the leaders of the Comanche club shares stories of a fictional character called the Laughing Man after their activities each week. John has a romance with a remarkable young woman named Mary Hudson. Soon the Laughing Man stories begin to take on the metaphoric twists of John's love life including rather sad and heartbreaking end of the romance.I wouldn't downplay the rest of the stories, but really good stories about love are hard to come by."
1,Typo,The board is labelled Abit Aw9D but the picture is that of a Aw8D. Price is consitent with that of a Aw8D. If it is really the Aw9d then you are really getting a great deal but I doubt it. Buyer beware!!!
4,Pretty good. a less new wave more pop seagulls,"Considering I'm a Metal/Industrial fan, the fact that I like this cd is wierd but its catchy, uplifting music, even if the lyrics are cheesy and unoriginal. Its the synth and guitar hooks that I like. I like certain pop groups like Xymox and such but AFOS is still good. Though I prefer their 80's material, this cd is worth it for the songs Burnin' Up, Magic, Your're Mine, and the title track.On another note, the drums and bass are pretty thick and heavy for the style of music this is. Get it if it is cheap and you have an open mind"
5,Best combination of gospel and Xmas songs,Very happy to get this combination to listen to all year round and especially for the Xmas season. The songs are the best compilation of Elvis gospel hits and together with the Xmas additions only make this CD a top and worthwhile collection to have.
5,He will always be in my heart. . .,"It's all been said a zillion times before - he is The King and shall always remain so. If this were not so, I would not waste my money on his music. I do not buy many CDs as I prefer only two singers' music."
5,Great Recording,"There is a lot of bang for your buck with this recording, you get great Elvis Christmas classics as well as a great selection of his gospel recordings. Excellent and entertaining compliation."
5,Elvis Cd,It is a most wonderful collection. I also bought one for my mom ...she listens to it everyday and loves it!!!
5,Oh Boy....More Elvis Christmas CD's,"If you love Elvis....this is a must have. Elvis Presley singing Christmas and Gospel in one set....Too Awesome. This CD is not as good as ""If Everyday Was Like Christmas."" That CD had some outtakes of his Christmas songs. RCA/BMG the fans want more outtakes of Elvis doing gospel and Christmas. How about a Follow That Dream CD of Christmas?"
3,NIGHT RIDE,PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE SHORT BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ FROM RICHARD LAYMON. BOOK HAS 27 PAGES.
4,Kind of a Let Down...,"Very creepy book! I liked it, but I was disappointed that I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be. I saw the movie first and it didn't really affect me that much either, except it is one of my favorite movies. The book is very well written, exciting, and there are some parts that spooked me, but otherwise it didn't scare me too much. If there's any book out there scarier than this one tell me and I'll try it."
5,THE MOST FRIGHTENING THING THAT I HAVE EVER READ!,"This book is so terrifying that I couldn't sleep until the demon was cast out of the the girl's body at the end. If you thought the movie took you to the edge, the book will take you all the way. It is disappointing, however, to see no new books coming from Blatty."
5,An Excellent Well Written and Intriguing Book,"This Book really evokes an atmosphere of evil, it starts off slowly and gradually works up to a great finale. anyone who has seen the filmn but not read the book is really missing out as much of the inner struggle intrigue and characterization of the book is missing from the film."
5,brilliant,"The exorcist is the most terrifying film ive ever seen it certainly does stay with you .I can tell you i was certainly hiding behind my pillow. it gets to you deep inside, they say its based on a true story (gosh). The actress that played the girl when she was possessed was excellent.if youve never seen this film get down to the shops now!"
5,Absolutely one of the best books you will ever read,Absolutely one of the best books you will ever read. I loved the movie but the book even more.
5,Scary and Well Written,"This is a justly famous book. It has an original story and is well told. Most importantly, it has characters who are individuals. When Blatty switches from one character to another you don't find yourself saying ""Who is this?"" You know. Of course, most people have seen the movie and they will be shocked to see that the events that occupy 50% of the film occupy the last 25 pages of the book. The book uses an interesting technique in that past events are interspersed in italics within the main body of the current time. I don't know for sure but this hearkens back to Hemingway's method in ""The Snows of Kilomanjaro"". All in all this is a good read and it is well worth the time."
5,The most frightening story ever written,What can be said for one of the most omnificent horror novels ever written? Whose sleep cannot be deprived after reading a chapter from this book? Who cannot turn each page with both anticipation and dread? Read if you dare...sleep if you can...gasp if you still have breath.
4,"""The Exorcist"" Book","I had seen the film, I liked it very much. A horror masterpiece. But soomething in me always told me I wasn't sattisfied with the film, I wished to see more intense parts. Few weeks ago I came to know about the book, I dont know what came in my mind but I thought the book might have the whole story more in detail.. and I was right. The book unlike the film scared me even more... since its much more in detail, dont get me wrong.. the film is good, but the book is even better. It scared me a lot, and there were certain parts not mentioned in the film at all, just certain minor details. If you love horror novels, this is a book just for you. Dont miss it."
2,Reads like an overlong screenplay.,"Well, I guess this will be an unpopular review, based on the opinions I see here praising the book, but here goes: The story is superb of course, and is absolutely a classic of horror, but the writing style STINKS. There is absolutely no detail in most of the ""scenes,"" and it reads like a movie screenplay, or even a short movie treatment. It's just too shallow in its narrative; too film-like. Knowing that Blatty writes primarily for the screen, this is not surprising. I can't even call it a novel - it's just not well written as a novel at all. There is no character development, and I feel like I'm looking at the characters through glass. You can't get to know them through the book at all. I love well-written literature, but with this classic story, I must advise that you do yourself a favor and just see the movie."
5,"Scary, scary, scary!!!!",I have probably seen the movie a dozen times but reading the book made me so scared that I actually had to fall asleep with the lights on in my bedroom. The book is more informative and does a better job in explaining what this demon is really about. Get it now!!!
5,This book MADE horror.,"I bought the book after I had seen the movie like... 10 times...It gave me the shivers every time I watched it. It did what a horror movie had to do, give me goose bumps when I had to RUN to the toilet thru the cold, dark hallway :)Now I decided the book and ofcourse it is like watching the movie again... Only, in some way, it is better then the movie. Lots of people say the book is always better, well, now I know why.For every fan of true horror, this is a MUST HAVE book!"
5,The ULTIMATE horror book!!!,"It's scary, it's suspenseful, it's everything you've heard about the book... I read it in six hours flat (finished it at three in the morning, no less), and I recommend you do the same if you buy the book--read it through non-stop the first time, then read it again. You'll discover his writing technique is amazing the second time around. And you start to really understand the characters the second time around as well. One of my favorite books. (Oh, and if you REALLY wanna enjoy this book, I highly recommend you read it after midnight with only one light on in your room--trust me, it's worth it!!!.)"
5,"An learned, honest and compelling work","An extraordinary novel, but not a work of horror at all. This is real theology dressed in the garb of a supernatural thriller. Blatty made clear for me exactly what the Catholic Church believes about the nature of evil and its place in a universe ruled by an all-powerful and benevolent God. I don't share those beliefs, but this compelling, eloquent presentation of them is highly recommended for anyone interested in the intellectual and spiritual issues involved. The author is obviously very learned and he fills his novel with wonderful discussions about psychiatry, medicine, science, and religion. It's an honest and subtle work that faces the difficult questions it raises head-on. I hardly expected so much intellectual depth from what I had ignorantly come to regard as a cheap shocker."
5,Fear...,"This has got to be the best horror (or any other for that matter), I have ever read. It's amazing, I practically finished it in less than a week. Anything I read from now on has got to be compared with this book from now on. The book takes you through events that can happen to anyone at anytime. You feel for the characters, the loss of faith, the evil and through it all. It's an amazing book. I loved it tremendously. The book was interpreted into an equally frightening film. It set the point for the second one, and the third took off from where the book ended. This is the right book to read in one go. Never take a breath and always, always, keep the lights on, you just don't know what might be coming out from under the bed and if your bed shakes, always call an Exorcist..."
5,The Exorcist,I found this book very engrossing and very frightening. I think it was better than the movie. The author did a good job with plot and character development.
4,missing pages in intro?,"I read The Exorcist in the early 70s. I remember being particularly entranced by the beautifully written introduction (10 to 25 pages or more) Northern Iraq. I recently bought a copy of the Exorcist for my wife but, sadly, the introduction has been severely edited, the pages taken out to start when the priest drinks tea in Northern Iraq. Does anyone know where I could find a complete, uncut printing of the Exorcist? Thanks."
5,A frightening mock-up of a real phenomena,"Yep, I'm one of them born again Christians and I believe in a spirit world---that Satan and evil spirits are real. However, Blatty fictionalizes exorcism and demon-possession when he throws in silly stuff like the swiveling head, the weird eyes, the quaking room, moving objects, etc. However, Blatty also grabs the reader at the beginning of the book and never lets go. This is a masterfully written suspense novel that fleshes out the main characters enough so that one really cares what is happening to them. The author could have strung this out to 300-400 pages but, wisely, he wrote it tightly and succinctly. I agree with reviewers who said that the movie rivals the book, which often cannot be said. The Possession of Emily Rose is a movie based roughly on a true story, though it over-dramatizes in places too. I would recommend you check out that movie if you're interested in learning more about possession."
1,A Better Movie then a Book,"I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily."
1,This was the worst book I've read. A complete waste of time.,"After seeing the truly terrifying movie, I had to get my hands on the book. All I can really say is, this is truly a terrible piece of work. A complete waste of time.The movie was so powerful and frightening, while the book doesn't even send a chill down your spine."
4,Review with caution,"I have no problem with the service nor the product ordered. I would have given 5 stars but my fear of the subject matter and my opinion that Blatty, the publishers, etc. would write/publish a book that contains the most blasphemous words ever written by man prevents me from giving the ultimate praise the reader in me feels it deserves. I have to make sure this book lies next to the Holy Bible to keep (hopefully) its darkness in check. The book itself was in the condition advertised. It arrived in a timely fashion. That is about as much praise I can give to to all involved in the selling and shipping of the most horrifying, disturbing, fascinating horror novel of all time. It will always be the 'Elvis' of horror novels--The King. Now I'm going to say my prayers to the Lord and I hope I didn't get myself in trouble with God ( may he forgive me for reading and most of the time enjoying this book)."
2,Too many mushrooms not enough truffles,"Product quality is average. Mfg. has added mushrooms in the butter and the truffle count has been scaled back. I thought I purchased truffle butter , not mushroom butter."
1,Not great taste.,"I was very disappointed in this product and will not purchase in the future. I also served it to guests who were in complete agreement. Obviously it is an acquired taste, which I will not bother trying to develope."
3,"A. Weiss, author of the BackSmart Fitness Plan",I wish more books have been written on the benfits of water and back pain-This was one of the first steps I took in healing my own back pain and swimming uses muscles in a smooth and focus manner unlike many land based exercises.
3,Not for children,As an adult the violence in the book was one that could be overlooked as part of the story line. I do not feel that it would be appropriate for younger readers.
1,boring,this book was so boring i did not even finish it...just could not get in to it glad it was free
1,I deleted this book from my Kindle,"I really tried to like this book but everytime I read this book I only could read for a brief time and then I had to lay it down. It was a depressing book filled with constant abuse and hardships and the plot was so slow moving and unchanging. When it did change it was a repeat from an earlier experience in the book. I realize that it was free but I would not even waste my time.There are so many other books on Amazon that are worthly of your time. Breakthrough in Tillies life did not have until that last page...very, very sad story."
3,Pennsylvania Dutch,I enjoyed reading the story and understanding a bit more of the Pennsylvania Dutch thinking. I would recommend it for readers.
4,"Tillie, a Mennonite Maid; a Story of the Pennsylvania Dutch",very well written. will read again and again. Reading on Kindle is great. Tillie is a great character and inspiring.
3,Tillie,"One of first books I read, it was okay, but have read so many really good books since then, puts this one to shame a little"
3,odd story,"I wouldn't recommend this. I normally like Amish fiction, but this is a little weird. It just dooesn't sit well. It's a historical novel. The characters are nice, vbut everything else, including the dialogue, is off."
4,Good reading,This is first book I've read by the author and found her writing style and story line one that was hard to put down.
2,Rip Off,"This is a very boring and predictable rip off of ""Sex and the City."" I could only take 3 episodes and stopped watching altogether. I can see why it was cancelled after 2 seasons."
2,Show me yours.,"This movie had a lot of sex scenes although they were very short. After watching the DVD for about 10 minutes,I stopped watching it.I found it was not very interesting to me."
1,V-Tech Laptop = Low-Tech Craptop!,"The software is so very 1980's that it's laughable (until the screaming starts) when you realize as the unit barks commands at you that you cannot mute it: you have 2 levels of volume control- Loud and a Little Less Loud but still freakin' annoying. I wanted to give my very bright little 4 year old daughter her own ""little computer"" to play with. She has fun on Daddy's big computer and with very little help can point and click with the mouse and is learning to use the arrow keys to manipulate cute characters on age appropriate web sites (Mickey Mouse Club House,etc..) and in K-1st grade software on our hardrive. I thought this product might get her OFF my comp and engaged and learning but alas... It was not to be. The unit LOOKS good but do NOT be fooled as I was!Disgruntled Dad"
1,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed in this ""laptop"" as was my 5 year old daughter on Christmas morning after she opened it. It is hardly anything close to a laptop, except that it is in the housingo f a mock laptop. The screen is so small you can hardly view it, it is not lit up so you have to be in bright light to even view the elements on the screen, lousy sound, confusing games. Overall just very antiquated, its like going back to the old apple computers of the 80s. She has played with it maybe a total of 10 minutes since december. I would send it back but the shipping is not even worth it."
1,I didn't know this software still existed!,"We sat down to write a disappointing review about this product...but we didn't have to. Jared Binder's review already had everything we would have written. Yes, it was cheap...but a lot of computer items are very affordable now. When we turned on the computer, this tiny little display came up in the middle of the ""screen"" displaying software that we thought no longer existed. For an intelligent 4 year old, your money would be better spent on low end desktop computer."
5,Great Trigger Release,"I just started archery and bow hunting this year. I have used three different releases prior to ordering this release, and this will be my release moving forward. I have large hands, and this release provides the appropriate fit. It is also more comfortable in comparison with the other releases I had tried. I recommend, especially if you have larger hands."
2,Hard to Use + Poor Sound Quality,"Bought this phone, charged it up and instantly noticed problems with the sound quality. Sound cut in and out frequently and it was hard to carry on a conversation. If the other end is another 2.4 system or a cell phone, the callee typically has a real hard time following the conversation. Also, this phone is hard to use which is apparently a typical problem with these new phones. I also really missed the 10 number speed dial. After fully charged I also found the handset very warm, almost too warm to handle. The keys are also very easy to accidently push which can cause problems if you are on the phone talking to someone. Yuck! Returned this one. I've experienced similar problems with other 2.4GHz phones, so this may be problematic for these new phones. I will probably go back to the less trendy but more reliable 900MHz phone line."
3,Wrong version of Street Life,"I would have rated this album a 4-star collection, even at a push, but it has 2 major flaws. This is far from being the finest collection of The Crusaders' work. It is a capital offence that the version of Street Life used on this compilation is not the original album version, now that's a song."
4,better than most,"This pump is better than several cheaper ones we've tried, though it does have a larger footprint. Rubber feet are excellent."
4,fairly quiet,"This air pump is fairly quiet with little ""spurts"" were it will get very loud, but this gets fixed by simply touching the thing... although i don't know why. it pumps a good amount of air into the tank, and i think the fish are very happy with it. I suggest buying this air pump for anyone who wants happy fish."
2,Noisy,"This thing is far from 'quite'. Not sure how loud the other reviewers pump was, but this thing makes a racket in my opinion. And no, it doesn't seem broken at all. This is probably how all of them sound.Not only does it emit a very low frequency 'buzz' that resonates all throughout my apartment (much louder than my fridge), but there is a high pitch buzzing noise as well. This thing is driving me crazy, I am probably going to have to buy/make some kind of sound dampening box or something to put this in because it's buzzing is one of the most annoying sounds I have ever heard in my life.Using my SPL meter, this thing is running at about 70dB.Aside from that it seems to run fine, gets a little warm though."
1,Tetra 20 Gallon Air Pump,"My Tetra 20 gallon air pump is NOT quiet. It makes a low hum more than twice as loud as my fridge and drives me nuts. I've got to find something better. No, its not defective. They should rename it from Whisper to Mack, like in Mack truck."
1,STAY AWAY FROM TETRA AIR PUMPS,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM IN MID DECEMBER AND IT WORKED FINE FOR TWO MONTHS AND THEN IT WOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY. I HAVE SINCE READ THAT THE DIAPHRAGM CRACKS AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS. THE REPAIR COST WOULD BE MORE THAN A NEW PUMP. STAY AWAY, RUN,RUN!!!"
4,Works great!,"I love the design, it's so great! My only issue with the product is that it hums. I wish it were more silent, but it's still more silent than other lesser known brands. I would recommend this product."
4,Air Pump,"Not as quiet as I was thought it would be, but boy does it have power. It overtook my 20 gallon tank so I put it on the 75 gallon and am very happy with it."
5,National Banjo Thumb Picks,"Great price and quick delivery. These picks are the only ones I use. They are very comfortable after a little adjustment in hot water to fit my thumb. Thanks, AD"
5,Medium is a little small,"Great thumb picks with solid feel. These seem to run on the small side and fit my thumb ""snugly"" but fortunately not too tight."
4,cool movie,i saw this movie on cable before when i was a young kid. and it was like the coolest movie ive ever seen.
3,Entertaining Mystery,"I also read the book ""The Westing Game"" and thought they did a pretty good job of adapting a complex book into a film. It's got a good wholesome message for kids."
3,a rich pricess get a view of the real world?,"The lead girl plays a clueless rich girl who wants to be a journalist.She tattles on her teachers and gets the piece in a local newspaper,which leads to trouble.The mystery of the disappeared teacher comes clearonce they find out his real name.She thinks she knows about fashionbut has near zero artistic sense of how colors look together:in one scene she comes in a green peddle pushers with a purple top.A dizzy movie type that is too much formula for me?"
3,A n ice lark of a Movie for the Teen Set,An OK plot with Lindsey Lohan sluething a missing teacher with a nice twist to the plot. Teens finding out while adults have problems. Oh well- it's a entertaining and fun Lark if you like that kind of movie.
3,Book vs Movie,"I watched this movie at school after reading the book. The Westing Game is being protrayed pretty poorly in this movie. It seems that much of the complex story line of the book had to be cut out for the movie format. Also, the Turtle in the movie could have done a better acting job. Many of the characters have changed and many have been omitted. However, I must give some credit to some aspects of the movie, because it is always difficult to create a book into a movie and keep the flavor of it. However, this movie is just short of par and could have been done better. However, if you're a fan of the Westing game, it's good to see the movie at least once."
1,WTF?,"This is by far the sloppiest mystery I have ever seen. The biggest mistake was having a LITTLE GIRL be the main character. HOW ANNOYING! The acting is bad almost all around and the script dies in ignorance before the movie ends. It also has plenty of plot holes(needless to say). For one thing I have a very hard time believing that some dumb little girl could figure out a whole complex mystery. Another one was if Westing was posing as 3 different people, when the dumb little girl reported him dead, the medical examiners would know that he was still alive, and the film dodges scenes like that for you not to notice. But I did and was very confused. I mean WTF?. And that ""queen sacrifice"" sublot was way bitz.The only way I could reccomend this movie is if you are home alone and feel like ""Hey, I want to watch a complex mystery that bedazzles me with stupidity"". Watch it if you are in that mood.1 star out of 4"
3,okay.,"honestly, i was really disappointed with this movie. i really wanted to see it so i did all this extra stuff at home so i could watch it on disney channel. it was a ripoff, if you ask me. and i agree with some of the other raters, her clothes, were, well, undescribable.( literally:( ) it did have some good parts, though. if you are looking for a good lindsey movie, i would suggest either parent trap or herbire: fully loaded. you might want to watch a really good movie i love called what a girl wants ( it stars amanda bynes instead of lindsey lohan.)i mean,come on, lindsey, you can do better!!!!!!!"
1,LINDSAY LOHAN IS A FUGLY BRAT,"ok i loved mean girls and yes confessions of a teenage drama queen was pretty good but get a clue...welkl its just crap!!! i mean have you seen what she wears...eew! cherry pants and ugly red holter tops..eew! i mean this girl is just a fugly piece of trash! and she thinks she's hot! i mean she is so not! she will always be that ugly freckle faced brat from the parent trap and she can never have a new image..bnd then she thinks she can bully hilary duff who has a much better screen presence than lindsay lohan and makes better movies aswell, so lindsay stop critising other beautiful celebrities and sue your manger for suggesting you make a crap movie like this and also sue your stylist..i mean those black and white pants at the end of the movie..dont get me started! eew! and also stop harrasing hilary duff,oh and if you think your a good actress and those fans who think she is..rent out life size and tell me if you think your a good actress!!!! AND HERBIE WAS CRAP!!!!"
4,Keeps growing on me,"I know this is a Disney movie for a certain audience but I have to say I rented it one night and really liked it. My reading choices are all very serious so I like a break when I put on a dvd. I appreciated the charm of this movie but what I noticed that I like a lot is how it has the feeling of a play in the writing. I felt like I was watching a decent high school production of a story. The acting is quite good in the context of this movie, I think Brenda Song has a long future as a comedic talent. It took me a couple of viewings to figure out why the city scape looked familiar, it's Toronto!"
3,sitting in a chair yoga works for some...,after i purchased and reviewed this 'dvd' and worked the exercises - i found i needed a bigger chair for one thing and the moves were good except my not being as flexiable as instructor was a disadvantage...................these moves can be done on the floor and on mat just as well....................not too excited about this section.......passed this 'dvd' to a friend who is trying it at this time.
5,Great!,I was looking for something EASY to introduce me to yoga...as a senior. This low-impact workout is perfect for me.
5,Great Mic,"We mounted this on the wall inside a ""non-traditional"" conference room (think something closer to a living room with a couch) and are using it for Skype calls. So far, so good.This thing is a solid, well built microphone with a nice inline pre-amp. You can unscrew the lid and inside you'll find two holes to mount this on the surface of your choice. It is very small and completely unobtrusive.All in all, I'm pretty impressed."
1,DO NOT BE FOOLED! DO NOT BUY CD WITH ORANGE COVER!,"Do not be fooled into buying ""The Best of Engelbert Humperdinck"" CD or MP3 downloads with the orange coverThe Best Of Engelbert Humperdinck. This collection IS NOT REALLY ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK. A couple tracks are live recordings from one of his concerts--the rest are karaoke versions that are not him but are being sold as him."
2,Cheap and Dirty Looking,"I am not impressed with this tea set at all. The lid to the sugar pot doesn't fit well and if tilted a bit, will fall into the pot. The colors are dingy looking. Not great quality."
1,"Nice phone, but buggy","I have owned this phone now for about a year. The first problem I observed with it is a problem with calling numbers in the phone book. You find the person you want to call, push talk, and nothing happens. However, try again a few more times, and bingo, it works. Annoying, but not the end of the world. The next problem, annoying clicking during calls, don't even have to be far away from the base for this to happen. Doesn't happen every call, but enough to now want me to get another phone. The latest problem, I place the phone back on the base, and it won't charge. I have to spend 30 seconds giggling it around to get it to sit correctly so the thing will charge.This phone had a lot of potential, but I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Good -- for a month,"I have had this phone for quite a while now and it didn't work right about 2 months into its use. All of a sudden during my conversations it would get fuzzy for about 1 second then come back. It would do this about every 7 seconds without stopping. I talked to panasonic and they said to replace the battery. Needless to say that didn't help either...Also, my friend got one the same time I did and he had the same problem! Don't get this phone!"
1,Bad phone and even worse repairs,I purchased this phone and it stopped working within the 1 year warranty. I mailed it to Panasonic over 2 months ago and still haven't gotten my phone back. The repair center does not return my calls. I will never buy another Panasonic product again.
1,This Phone is Garbage,"After using this for about a year, a recurring ""Out of Range"" problem occurs. This phone is not worth your money. I'm never buying a Panasonic cordless phone again."
2,Very poor reception and no display on the handset,"After reading all the positive reviews for this phone, I was expecting to be impressed. This is our 4th cordless phone, and by far the worst.The caller's voice is muffled and quiet. The microphone picks up background noise and seems to amplify it through the speaker, so even with the slightest amount of background noise it's very difficult to understand what is being said. The handset doesn't seem to conform to the face well, so it feels very uncomfortable as I'm trying straining to hear.With everyone else saying how clear reception is, I have to wonder if we have a dud on our hands.My other criticism of this phone is that there is no display on the handset, unlike all our previous phones. I'm not the most careful dialer, and quite often make mistakes. Without a display, I can't tell if I've entered the right number nor can I tell if Redial is recalling the number I expect.All in all, very very disappointed with this phone."
1,caller id phone,"i bought two of these phones a year ago and they both have ceased to function....when retrieving numbers from the caller id the screen will say ""out of range"" when I am right next to the base...worked great, but did not last long..."
1,"Good in the beginning, but...","I really liked this phone out of the box. The reception was great, range good, caller ID good, solid feel and good looks. (note; had this phone but the model with the caller ID) After 9-10 months of use, however, the phone is useless. The reception is pathetic (can't understand the caller even when right beside the base), calls don't go through to the handset even when in the charger and I'm always getting the 'Out of Range' message (again, even when right beside the base). May have been a dud but I expect to get more than 1 year out of even the cheapest phone. Am shopping for a replacement right now and would not even consider this phone, even at a fraction of the price!"
1,Over 6 months.... not worth the $$,"I agree totally with everyone here. All of a sudden (like after 6 months of use) the phone buzzes and hisses when i am on a call, attempting to change channels results in an ""out of range"" message - i have a studio in nyc - 30' is the max ill ever be from the base! heavens forbid this is near ANY other electronic device - it goes mad! stick with the less picky 900mhz or do like im about to do and skip panasonic alltogether in the cordless market!"
1,Fine while it lasted,"I'm really unhappy with this phone. It worked great for a little under a year, and now it's totally unusable. Everything comes out very distorted and I can barely hear what anybody is saying. I really do expect a product like this to last more than a few months! Given how many of the reviews mention reliability problems, I'd recommend taking any review by somebody who has owned this phone for less than six months with a big grain of salt."
2,The Bluewater adaptation only collects the first four issues! Where's issues 5 & 6?,"I'm a fan of the whole ""Logan Trilogy"" and looked forward to this comic adaptation. Unfortunately, the Bluewater adaptation only collect issues 1-4 of their 6-issue mini-series! According to Bluewater, issues 5 & 6 are going to print soon, so why print this collection of the six issue mini-series before it's even complete? That's a shame, because I found this comic adaptation to be pretty faithful to the original novel, and not the cheesy-but-lovable 1976 MGM movie. If this book had all six issues reprinted, it'd probably get a four star rating from me!"
2,"good movie, ok book","The author was trying for fast-paced adventure here, I hope, and nothing else. Because that's what this book is. Actually, it moves so fast, it somehow gets a childish feel to it, as if a teenager wrote it. The lack of characterization is almost shocking considering how good the movie was. The book is just a rapid series of pointless and not very exciting adventures in which Logan meets a foe, defeats him, moves on, and so on and so on and so on. In all honesty, I have seldom been this disapponted in a book."
4,Great post-apocalyptic story,"This book was a welcome change from all the crappy college text I've been reading lately. I am a huge fan of the movie - but this book really does develop more interesting details about Logan's run for freedom. For those that don't know, it came out BEFORE the movie, so you aren't getting some lame book adaptation either. I hope I can get all my friends to read this book just like I got them to watch the movie. Ahhhh Sanctuary."
5,Joe Pass is the man,"..I'm writing this as I sat down listening to my hero Joe Passplaying ""on a clear day"". Wow, I hear hot Jazz licks afterlicks. This guy can easily kick George Benson's bud if he wants to.Forget about Pat Metheny, Joe and Wes Montgomery is where its at.They produced one of the best Jazz guitar solos ever hit this planet."
3,Poker Programming,"I really like the Hoyle card games, especially Spades, Hearts, and Gin Rummy. However, the Poker game is not at all realistic. Whoever wrote the paramaters evidentally knows absolutely nothing about poker probalities.I do not play it often, but played two games tonight. In one game there were SIX times that a player got four of a kind! Twice it was four aces! The probabalities of that is somewhere two million to one.I would surely like to see you issue an upgrade to this game to make it more realistic.Sincerely,Thomas Wallbrakeone@insightbb.com"
