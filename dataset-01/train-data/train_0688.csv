5,"Great collection, but one thing does bug me...","I love how just about every comic strip from Calvin & Hobbes is included in this collection and it is a much cheaper alternative to buying all the older collection books. However, one thing does bug me a little bit. In the first book in this collection, there is a strip where Calvin askes his mom if he was adopted, if he will be forced to work in a cannery when he turns 7, and if he's being fattened up to be eaten. Well, in this collection, the adoption question is edited and becomes ""Was I genetically engineered or cloned?"" Did Bill Watterson get so much flak from the adoption people about comparing adoption to slavery and cannibalism that he had to change the strip? I wonder if that was the only strip that was changed. Still, this is a great collection of comics."
5,nuff said,"every single panel, ever. what is not to love? a must have for any Bill Watterson Junkie. You never know when you're gonna need a priority check in life."
3,The Pages are Falling Out,"I love this strip and I was very excited to see it collected completely in a lovely boxed set. I have only one fault with the item but it is a big one. For a set of this nature and for this price, you would think the publishers could have spent a few extra bucks and given the thing a proper binding! I've read through the collection only twice and the spine is already cracked on volume one and a page has actually come out! How much could a real stitched binding have added to the price? I plan to send my books off to Southern Binding and have them sewn. It will cost me about $30 but I believe it will be well worth it in the long run. Still, I'd rather have paid a few more buck up front."
5,An excellently bound collection...,"This is just to correct the review below which states that the pages are glued to the spine instead of sewn. This is not true. The pages are indeed bound in signatures, 6-page signatures to be precise (I believe this is not an usual number, but the paper is thick; they are signatures all the same), 8 stitches per signature. Which to my eyes is a very good binding, as good as any hardback and better than most.On the other hand, I would have liked a complete cloth cover, instead of half paper-half cloth. I see the paper corners wearing out, etc. But on the glued-sewn business, there are no complaints.The contents themselves are well described elsewhere on this page and they are simply fantastic."
5,Any Fan's Must-Have,"Presented in a slip case containing three large volumes, this is a compilation of Bill Watterson's entire ten years of Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. For any fan of Calvin and Hobbes, that's all that need be said. I can spend ten minutes in the morning reading a few pages and chuckle for the rest of the day."
5,Very nice set of books!!!,I bought this set of books for my 12 year old son who is an avid reader of Calvin and Hobbes. I also enjoy that little rascal and his tiger. These books come in a nice slide out case. The books are heavy and well made. These books will be great for passing down for generations because they are so well put together. And of course the comics are nothing but funny!
5,If you're into a collectable like this - then Yes.,"My son wanted this. He got a lot of cash for his birthday, and reasoned that he should be able to buy something with some of it (we normally put it all in his untouched savings account).So, we got it for him.He read it all in about four to five days.Didn't feel like we got a whole lot for about a hundred bucks, since he read it so fast.But, it IS a collectable set. Not exactly a bunch of paperback editions, which are more for the casual reader. And we knew exactly what we were doing when we ordered it. It was splurging for the sake of a birthday gift.If you're not a collector, or not looking to get an uncommon or extra-special gift, then don't get this.Otherwise.... go for it."
5,NOT 1 DENT!!!!,"I just received them today, I had to let you guys know that there was nothing wrong with product. No dents, scratch, etc... I didn't open the actually books, because it is a gift to someone else. I was so nervous that I would get them, and the package would be damage, but nothing!!!"
5,My kid loves it,"My 12 year-old has such a passion for this book. She has read through this so many times that she can (and does) quote individual comics frequently. Great quality binding, paper, color and the content...well, you know or you wouldn't be interested in buying it too."
5,Best book set Ever,"Yes, this is heavy, but it's so worth it. Calvin and Hobbes is the best comic strip I have ever read. I wish it never ended"
4,LOVE IT,"I was only 6 when the strip ended. I never knew of its existence until walking into a Waldenbooks at my mall in the early 2000s. I wanted a Peanuts or Garfield book but they were too much money. I found in the sales section a couple of C&H; compilation books that ran between $5 and $10 dollars. It was through that I became hooked.I got this complete collection a few months back and enjoy it immensely. I am glad this comes in a set of 3 books all sold together as opposed to Bloom County a strip that ran for 1 year less than C&H; but took 5 books to complete and each book retails at $40. It would be nice if C&H; came in a set of 5 simply because it would make it easier to handle, but then that only gives Andrews McMeel the chance to charge more for each book individually.The books are organized by date, although some are out of order, not sure if this was an accident or not.My biggest complaint is that these are rather heavy books to handle but they are well worth buying nonetheless."
5,Calvin and Hobbes!!!!!!!!,This Calvin and Hobbes book is great for any person who loves a good funny cartoon. The cartoon set is packed full of every cartoon ever made for Calvin and Hobbes and is a worth every penny. The set comes with a good box to hold the books which together are about 24 pounds. The binding on the books is great and will not rip any quickly and the paper is high quality and will go through a lot before it starts ripping. This is a great book for all and is a great lasting gift.
3,"An excellent collection, just a shame about the quality","If you're a Calvin and Hobbes fan then you'll probably want to buy this collection, but this recommendation comes with a warning. The packaging and print quality is sadly not all that it should be. On my copy the advertising glue has remained stuck to the fabric of the box, and the fabric has come unstuck at the opening of the box as soon as I removed the first volume from it. The print quality is generally very good, but in places you can see artefacts where the ink has run on the backing paper. Having the entire collection in one place is a really great idea, just let down by the execution of the packaging."
1,Horrible binding,The cover of volume 3 completely fell apart from the binding. Appalling work. I am trying to get something done about it but I have owned it for about a yeat ( although it has been treated with the utmost care) so it is doubtful anything can be done. Encourage people not purchase this book until Mcneel start to produce quality work.
1,Great content--exploitive edition.,"Yes, it is well printed on good paper but the BINDING is completely wrong. The set is clearly made for those who love the strip and want to look at it again and again. If you actually do this, the pages are going to pull away from the glued spine and you better get an archival storage box.Come to think of it, that may be the best thing to do."
3,"Great collection, poor binding quality","Though the collection is wonderful, the binding is very poor. After two months of occasional reading, the binding started to sag. We've had them now for a year, unfortunately, the pages are falling out and the covers are barely clinging to the backs of the books. The only thing that looks good is the box the books came in. I am very disappointed.I wish now that I'd bought the paperback copies. I'd give five stars for the content, and one star for the poor binding quality."
5,Be careful if you're an overseas buyer,"I was eagerly anticipating this to arrive when I ordered it, but despite their best intentions in packing it, my copy arrived with severe dents on the corners due to mishandling by the various postal services. While the damage was not so bad that the books were ruined, I know I would have been extremely mad if I had intended to collect this.I'll leave the reviewing of the content to some more capable fans and critics, and suffice it to say that I am a huge Watterson fan, not only for his fantastic work, but also his integrity in maintaining it, which is explained in loving detail in the introduction. Calvin and Hobbes will definitely stand as one of the all-time great comics."
2,Books are falling apart after a week - shameful work!,"The binding of these books is awful! The pages are simply glued to the fabric spine, and after just over a week of reading, they are coming off and I have to keep them from getting damaged.A work like this deserves a much better rendition and careful binding. I'm looking into rebinding this marvelous work by a professional bookbinder, before the pages get creased or torn.Apart from that (and the fact Bill Watterson desecrated his work by editing some of the original strips), this is one of the best books I ever purchased! My teen dreams come true."
5,"Finally, a compilation in a form worthy of the strip.","This is it! Every strip ever published, in order, nicely bound in a package that will look good on the any bookshelf. Individual volumes (there are 3) will look great on the coffee table.It's great to read these strips in order and watch the characters and themes develop over the years."
5,Great! It includes everything!,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It's very well put together and includes all of Calvin and Hobbes including a few extras created for the books. I definitely recommend it for any Calvin and Hobbes fan!
5,Calvin and Hobbes,the set of books is excellent and arrived before the projected delivery date which was greatly appreciated!
1,"more redundancy, and this time poor quality materials","Mr. Watterson and his publishers are shrewd people. After a couple decades of hammering us with redundant reprint books, the kind that force you to buy every one of them so you can get a more complete collection, they finally publish the complete collection.But this collection is so shoddy that it is a crime. The materials used are junk, and pages fall out. Don't buy it. Or better yet, go buy all the past reprint books at used prices and you will conserve your money and there will be one less sale for this Andrews McMeel Publishing disaster.I would think a cartoonist that fought to keep his characters and strip from being licensed to death in other arenas (like toys and coffee mugs) would have more integrity and want to make a first class collection for his fans."
3,"It's complete, but in rough shape","I purchased this set used. It was only $20 off the new price; I think it might have been priced less. It had seen hard use in a public library. If I'd known that the spine of one of the books was broken, I would have bought the set new. I was pleased that there were no pages missing."
5,the child in all of us,"This compendium reflects what I believe to be the best and most incisive cartoon characters ever created. That Bill Watterson chose to quit writing this wonderful series at a time when his powers were at their height displayed both courage and consideration and, while all of us Calvin and Hobbes fans would dearly have loved him to continue, what we have we will hold, pass on to our kids and our friends and enjoy their pleasure as much as our own.This is a massive work of pure genius and is presented beautifully. While it is not light in weight it is lightweight in humour and content, yet multi-layered, as all the best cartoons should be.Buying this on Amazon makes a lot of sense, as not only is it considerably less expensive than in the stores, but by doing so, one avoids the risk of damaging back or neck ligaments carrying it from the bookstore to the car."
5,You already know,"You already know if you want this or not, c'mon. This is maybe the greatest comic strip and it easily has the best art. Enjoy."
5,a Christmas Gift,Bought for my brother for Christmas as we loved Calvin and Hobbes growing up. Great books! Nice that you can get them all in one go (though I didn't love that the price is printed irremoveably on the box :P
5,Best collection of Bill Wattersons work,"I had been looking for a collection of Calvin & Hobbes and decided to take a chance since this one was on sale. I'M SO GLAD I DID. THIS COLLECTION IS FANTASTIC! The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Calvin & Hobbes) (v. 1, 2, 3)The binding is beautiful, built to last many years. The printing is clear and sharp, the colors just pop off the page. It is a size that allows easy reading. The sections are arraigned to keep sequential themes or story lines intact.You will not be sorry you invested in this terrific set (all 24 pounds worth!). I like this one so much I intend to purchase several more that are offered from the same publisher. BUY IT NOW; or you will regret it later when it's out of print!"
4,Complete Calvin and Hobbes,"This is a deep philosophical book where one can find every answers for the every main questions of our life: Where we come from? Why we are here? What is the reason of our existence? The problem Kerkergaard can't solve, Calvin solve quite easy - the main reason of humankid is to hit Susie with a biggest in Universe snowball. That's it."
4,LIFE OF SWEET NOTHINGNESS,"Sweet Nothing is a fantastic movie portraying the lives of a young couple struggling to have a life in NYC.A young Michael Imperioli,and Mira Sorvino lend credence to a story of drugs,love,and loss! A MUST SEE!"
5,"sigh, I want a Highlander in a kilt","I love Sue-Ellen Welfonder, one of the best Scottish Historical writers, but I was tickled to get this book as a gift for my birthday. Burroughs captured my attention and kept it from start to finish. This book has the style of old-fashioned saga historical romances. I hope this is a trend coming back. It's so hard to find these.I am eager to read this author's other works."
1,Spell check your book,I have never in my life read a book with so many grammatical errors. It was unreal. It may have been easier to overlook if the story actually went somewhere...
5,amazing debut book,"I swiped this book from my cousin when I was visiting her last month. She'd ""borrowed"" it from her sister, who lifted her from her niece. Likely she made free with her aunt's copy. Showing the ladies in the family (Scots, mind you) enjoyed Burroughs' debut book.As with all debut writers you might see a little room for a wee bit of polish, but what comes through most is Burroughs obvious love for Scotland and it's history.I really enjoyed this tale and off to ""borrow"" her second book from some family member."
1,Don't waste your money or time!,"I bought this just a few days ago, and it's going back to the retailer.This would be a 0 star review if I had that option.First, after 1 day of use it started to make a howling sound when printing. Called Samsung techsupport, had them listen to it, and they agreed it was defective. A ""rare"" problem, they said. Right.Second, it cannot print on laser glossy paper; the toner lifts off the paper. I tried sample sheets of two brand-name laser glossy paper with the same result. Again called Samsung techsupport, and they confirmed that this problem exists. I asked them to recommend any glossy paper to use, and they could not."
1,"Great when new, then not so great","I've had this printer for about a year. The warranty just ran out and the printer started to refuse to pickup even a single sheet of paper. Thankfully, my visa card is going to reimburse the $70 repair bill to replace what looks like $3 worth of rubber parts (pickup roller and page separator). It was a decent (yet low budget) color printer while it lasted (for a whopping 500 pages over 13 months). I don't plan on spending any more money on this thing. When it dies again, it's getting junked.EDIT: It died again. This is a terrible printer. It didn't even live lopng enough to get through the starter cartridges that shipped with it when new. How can a printer fail TWICE before the mini starter cartridges are even used up?DO NOT BUY."
2,Samsung CPL 300 Color Lased Printer,"The unit is small and fits on a desk. Set up was easy and I had the unit working in a very short time. The prints are very good. I needed a printer to do a number of copies in color and black and white of the same page, mostly photographs with some text. The first page came out fairly quickly but when i printed a number of the same page, the unit became SO SLOW that it became a poor purchase. If you are not doing multiple copies the unit would be OK. I am going to get a different printer."
1,Don't buy this thing,"This lasted a little over a year before the imaging unit went bad and it wouldn't print clearly in black. Naturally, since the warranty was 12 months. A new imaging unit cost me $100, which I figured was cheaper than buying a whole new printer, so it's back up and running fine now. I've not experienced any of the paper jams that are frequently mentioned in other reviews, but there are better printers on the market. Don't get taken in by the low price. Add $100 to whatever price you see listed."
1,PAPER JAM PAPER JAM PAPER JAM PAPER JAM PAPER JAM PAPER JAM,I had this printer for over a year and I can't stress how much this printer been giving me hell and back! The main problem is constant paper jam. It was in the shop once and it was never any better but got worst. I got this printer for cheap and be warn it is not worth the hassle. DO NOT GET THIS PRINTER!!! get a Brother...they are known for lack of paper jam issues.
4,cant think of anything wrong,"used for several years, print quality is great. i've also been able to find inexpensive replacement toner that works as good as oem"
1,Wish I Hadn't Been So Quick to Buy,"I, too, had ongoing paper jams after having this printer a few months. I opted to take it to the authorized repair shop, where they replaced the Paper Pickup Roller under warranty; it worked fine. Then, after the unit had been in use for slightly over a year, it developed light ""streaks"" down one side. After reading the troubleshooting guide and comments on the internet, it was obvious it needed a new imaging unit. I purchased one of those and the unit worked fine (though the imaging unit squeaked). Three months later, there is light ""streaking"" across the page--top and at intervals. I give up. The color output has always been questionable, but I can't do without black! I definitely got what I paid for (when it's too good to be true, it is.)"
1,Printer broke before the ink ran out!!!,"I've never had such a lousy experience with a printer. We bought two of these, one for Mac and one for PC. So it wasn't the operating system.We really didn't ask much from this printer, just a few pages here and there, maybe 100/week?Right after the year mark on the warranty, it began smelling hot, and would not print unless I repeatedly opened and closed the different compartments on it. The first reaction it would have to a print job would be the red light, indicating a jam. No jam. 5 minutes later, after repeating the above-described routine of opening and closing its compartments, it begins to print.The quality on it was very poor, and the moving parts inside are flimsy and poorly designed.I would NOT recommend you buy it. I plan to replace it with the same HP I use at work."
1,Do NOT buy this printer,"I have had this printer for just over a year and it was great at first, but now it doesn't print correctly (of course because now the warranty is up) on the left side of the paper in black and white anymore. (Do an internet search, it's not just my printer although the rude customer support people told me that it was less than 1% of CLP-300's which I just can't believe.) I contacted Samsung support (again, the rudest bunch of people that I have EVER spoken to) and they basically told me that they couldn't help me. It doesn't matter that I've only ever printed 3500 pages TOTAL on this printer, if it's more than a year they won't do a thing. I even asked for a supervisor who actually hung up on me when I stated that I couldn't believe how rude their customer service was. Bottom line, this printer is a piece of junk and it makes me re-think buying ANYTHING made by Samsung in the future."
1,Constantly Jams,"This is one of the most frustrating printers I've ever owned. Picked it up at Staples about a year ago because it was on sale and thought it would be good for the kids to use. (If I had it to do again, I'd spend another $100 and get something in the OKI C5100 / 5200 series -- those things are workhorses and mine hasn't jammed in the four years I've had it.)The Samsung now jams just about every time a piece of paper is fed through. My guess is a bad quality rubber paper pickup is to blame. I tried some professional roller cleaner and it helped a little. Beware..."
1,This printer stinks!,Bought this printer and had problems with paper jams less than a month in. Have jams ever since. It literally takes me 30 minutes to print 10 pages because I keep having to hand feed the paper in and press down on the top cover to avoid jams.... even that is not consistent. Don't buy this printer!
2,They should call it a jammer instead of a printer.,"The print quality is good, when you can get it to print.I have print jams approx. 6 times out of 10. I like Samsung products, but have never had a printer jam this often in all of my office or home printers I have ever used."
1,Paper jams have rendered this machine useless,"At first it chugged along nicely, then it begun to jam when printing in black and white but colour was still ok. After about a year of infrequent use, I can barely get a page out of this piece of junk, because of feed errors at all stages of the print cycle. I thought this machine was too good to be true at this size and price, and I was right."
1,A nightmare!!,"I wish I could go back in time and NOT buy this hideous printer.Owning it has been a complete nightmare! Forget about printing almost anything just once, do not even try to print pictures. Prepare to stack up on any paper; because you will have to use many sheets to get one page OK.Please, save your self a lot of frustration and get a better printer."
1,"Jams, rubber boot needs cleaning",This printer produces nice images but every 200 or so pages it starts jamming because the rubber boot doesn't kick the paper out of the tray. Cleaning the boot with a wet cloth reactivates the boot. Avoid this printer.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,this is a piece of junk. I have spent hours of my life coaxing it into occasionally printing one sheet. Now it has died after a few months.
2,Paper feed is a nightmare. Color is poor. Mac OS driver is minimal,"I would not recommend this printer. After a couple hundred prints, the paper cartridge began to fail. It can no longer reliably grab and feed sheets (I am using pristine, high-quality laser paper) I can now get it to work half of the time, only by precariously tipping the machine back at a 30-degree angle allowing gravity to help the grabber.Moreover, the color is much too dark, and only Windows users have access to color management in the driver software. The Mac driver offers only bare-bones options. There are other comparably priced color-printers out there that are far superior quality, reliability, and better-supported for Mac."
1,A Seemingly Great Printer for an Excellent Price...,"When I initially purchased this printer I was ecstatic. Low price, small size and excellent quality. There were a few problems with paper jams, but they were seldom and few between.I've owned this printer now for over six months, and the jams are now constant and occur on almost every single printing session. I looked for solutions on-line and apparently there's no fix other than purchasing a new roller, which isn't exactly cheap.Save your money and pay for a quality printer that doesn't cause you to tear out your hair in frustration."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING PURCHASE,"Initially it worked great. Once in a while, there would be a paper jam, which was a nuisance, but it didn't bother me that much since I didn't do a lot of printing. But one day, I get the dreaded red light again, but this time, I just cannot print, period, even after I take the paper out. I keep trying again and again-but for some reason the paper gets jammed and cannot go smoothly through the rollers. This is unbelievably frustrating!! I see here on the posts that I'm not the only one. Quite frankly, Samsung needs to build a better product. I regret this purchase and will go back to the trusted names like HP, Epson and Lexmark. Since my warranty is over, this is completely useless and will be going in the trash very soon..."
2,Jams all the time >_<,"When this printer actually works, it's great and takes 2 secods to print a page, but it constantly jams. I've had it for under a year and now it jams at exit and no matter what I do (trust me, I've done everything) nothing works. I wish I read the reviews about it before purchasing."
1,Dont Buy.,The Samsung CLP 300 has poor print quality. The colors are worse. I too bought this to replace my ink based printer. You get what you pay for. My documents do not have a fine detail to them. The colors don't match. I'm returning this and upgrading to a better color laser printer.
1,Disposable quality,"This product worked great for a year and then became a messy turd. When you replace the toner cartridges they dump all over the place regardless of how careful you are.There is a known problem with them where black toner builds up and it senses this as toner on the paper and decreases the amount of toner it puts out. All prints become faded, even with a new cartridge.Finally it has another common problem where the toner cartridges get kicked out of their bays and open the front panel halting printing. Despite pushing it in repeatedly and looking for blockages you can't stop it.Overall it ws a nice printer, it is not built to last though. The price tag doesn't match the value."
2,frustration plus,"Two problems persisted with the Samsung CLP 300-N:1) changing print cartridges is difficult and awkward .PREMIUM COMPATIBLE 4-Color Toner Cartridge, CLP-3004PK. The Generic CLP300 4 pack (Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) toner is compatible with Samsung CLP-300, CLP-300N printers.;2) recently, it simply stopped printing. I thought it was the usb cable, but it wasn't. So suddenly this piece of junk is absolutely worthless.Nevertheless, I liked the features that did work, when they worked. It is small enough and compact and fits in a limited space. Color printing especially was sharp and clear. Speed was acceptable.I've had this Samsung for about two years. That's a short life as printers go.Caveat emptor!"
1,AVOID THIS,"I've had this printer for about two years and it has never printed without jamming after every other sheet at least. I've tried cleaning the rollers multiple times and sometimes it prints a page, then back to jams."
1,"Horrible, Terrible Printer","I can't begin to express how much I hate this printer. When it actually prints, the quality is awful. It often refuses to print for no apparent reason unless you open and close the cover half a dozen times. I should have returned it the very first day I bought it and I now curse my laziness. I'm shopping now for a new printer and have to send this one to the dump.Oh, and did I mention that my hands are covered with toner from trying to get it to unjam? What a terrible product."
2,Started out okay at first... but don't waste your money...,"I first purchased and received this item in June of 2008. At first, it was pretty good - quality-wise. However, I began to notice that:1) It consumes a lot of energy (my lights would actually flicker and dim when the printer was turned on).2) It would get very, very hot, very quickly, hotter than any other color laser jet I've tried out.3) Lastly, when I would try to print out double sided CD inserts for my music, the heat from the printer would cause the already-printed side to 'melt' or 'flake off' when the paper would go through the printer the 2nd time to print the opposing side. And no, it wasn't my choice of paper - the paper I used was meant to be double-sided.To top it off, 4 months after purchasing the Samsung CLP, the paper would jam every single time I tried to print, and so I brought it to Best Buy and exchanged it.I'd recommend the HP Color Laser Jet, which runs for the same price (at Best Buy, that is). Good luck."
1,Stay Away,"Samsung easily has the worst customer service possible, in fact I can't imagine how it could be worse. My printer failed after 5 months use and I have been dealing with trying to get a warranty replacement for over two months and it has yet to be resolved."
4,As advertised - quick reliable transaction,"When I couldn't get Sears to send me the right part for my furnace I turned online and made this purchase. The processing of the order was easy, delivery was efficient and product was as advertised. Very satisfied."
5,Outstandingly Crazy!!!,"If you are looking for a good time on a sunday night when all of your friends are at church and/or sick of all that christian ska hype, I strongly recommend this to you. Gwen, Adrian, Tom, and Tony put on a show that should go down in the history books. Even if you dont like ska, you would still enjoy this video. Highly recommended to everyone!"
4,Isn't it funny?,"I found this tape and decided that, hey, I like No Doubt and I like live shows, this is will be kind of like being there without having to be. It was a good show. Very energetic, unbelievable really. I just thought it was interesting how Gwen's ""babydoll"" voice disappeared the second she left the stage. She is truely a performer and personality."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this video based on the good reviews. Bad idea on my part.First of all when this video came out they had about two hits. Secondly, they never show the audience.The only show the band's faces. I started getting claustraphobic. Pllus the performance was a bit sophmoric. They are better performers now. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
1,boring!,Do not listen to the reviews. It doesn't show any views of theaudience.This is soooo boring.They only had like 2 hits when this was made.
5,Mmm...tastes good...I mean-Mmm...sounds good,Any No Doubt fan will absolutely love this video. Girls will appreciate Gwen's humor in Just a Girl. Don't ask.
5,I LOVED IT....,"I think this video is awesome, and that all the no doubt fans SHOULD have it! I watched it once and I can't stop watching it now!"
1,Not The Same,"I've used this brand since 2009. They are not particularly long-lasting, but the utility makes up for it. Unfortunately, the quality has degraded. The last batch (three pair) I bought have a big problem: the zippers are terrible. It's very difficult to close them. What a shame."
2,but the zipper,"Loved these things when I received them, but seems my washing machine was just too much for them. the zipper just fell apart. Have another pair and so far so good."
2,Bad sizing!,"I thought these would be the same as the fatigues sold by Captain Dave's, but these are way bigger. I bought a Large, and these are about 3"" wider and 3"" longer than the other pants I bought. They have cinch straps on the sides to adjust the waist, but those don't even stay tight. It has a nice material and I can't say how long lasting they are, but the size is just so off. I'd give it 1 star, because I'll probably never wear these, but at least now I have pants I can wear with my Halloween costume and not mind ruining."
5,Grill'n tools,"This is a nice set, I purchased this set from Amazon and am happy with them. I would recommend them to my friends."
1,"Great tools, BAD case","I bought this because I wanted my grill tools in a case so I could keep them out of reach of my grandchildren. I find the tools well made, well designed and very useful. I have a fairly deep grill (Weber Genesis E-320) and the length of the tools makes it easy to work with food on the back of the grill.That said, the case is very disappointing. I have used it less than two months, it has not been abused in any way, but the veneer on both the top and the front of the case are separating. The problem showed up out of the 30 day return window, or I would have sent it back for a refund/exchange. Do Not Buy this item."
3,"Interesting, but plenty of filler.","I'll give credit to Linda Perry for having a captivating voice(although she does remind me a lot of Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde), and ""What's Up"", ""Drifting"", and ""Spaceman"" are ballads that I never get tired of. Unfortunately, the rest of the album never really grew on me, and ""Dear Mr. President"" is the perfect example of a good instrumental song ruined by cliched lyrics. Basically, it's the sound of a band trying to make a statement without having anything to say.For those of you that liked their one hit, I say try to borrow this before you buy it, and if you hated their one hit, you still might try giving this one a chance because half of the songs follow the same formula as ""What's Up"" and the other half sound like a different band altogether."
4,poor choice for second single,"A very underrated record. Following up 'What's Up?"" with ""Spaceman"" was a bad decision. The followup singles should have been ""Calling all the people"" and ""Drifting."" If you've always liked ""What's Up?"" but never heard the whole album, it's worth having."
4,"great singer, wish they'd done more","A relatively unknown band, whose one hit, ""what's up"" received moderate airplay once upon a time. The best feature of the group is lead singer Linda Perry's distinctive vocals (I've heard her compared to a female Robert Plant, which I think is a bit of a stretch), backed up by some great guitar playing. When all's said and done, these 4 brunettes (presumably) really put out a pretty decent album. It was a little too hard to appeal to the pop-driven masses, but the music is well written and almost brings to mind the same intensity of 1970's Heart. Reccomended for anyone who likes a good rock album with a powerful female vocalist. Although I haven't heard it yet, Linda Perry has released a solo album which is still on my ""to try"" list. For now though, I (reluctantly) have to agree with critics who have placed the 4NB into the one-hit wonder pile."
1,"Eh, whatever.","This album was a total non-event. The big ""hit"" was a caterwauling mess with pretentious lyrics. Thank the lord these four ladies were scattered to the four winds."
1,Are You People Nuts?,"""What's Up"" has got to be one of the worst singles of all time. The music is uninspired and the ""singing"" is gawdawful. I was forced to listen to this album years ago by some misguided friends and I honestly did want to know what IS going on. There are fine examples of folk/rock/soul/etc but this ain't one of them."
1,Complete and Utter Crap!,"Hey, the title says it all. The music sucks, the lyrics are absurd and the vocals are painful to listen to. Highly recommended for listeners with self-masochistic tendancies. Here's a clue - when you can easily find a hundred or so of a used CD for less than two bucks, it's gonna suck! And 4 non-talented-non-blondes really do suck and they suck big time with a capital S!A ""friend"" recommended this to me. Thank God for Amazon's sound clips or I'd be doin' life without parole now! Needless to say, I'm now happily less one tone-deaf, musically inept friend. If you got to this review via a personal recommendation, start searching for dark and sinister ulterior motives from that person. They are not your friend! I repeat - NOT you friend!!!Don't comtemplate even a nanosecond about buying this awful, nauseating, nails on the chalkboard CD! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!!(...and the usual caveat about not being able to give zero stars...)"
5,Missed out on the last 18 years,"Like most everyone else, I was one of those kids in the 90's glued to the radio listening for what would be the next big thing, ""What's Up"" turned out to be one of those things for a hot minute. What one-hit-wonder fans of that song don't realize is that this album is an outstanding listen from start to finish. There isn't a bad song here. And this is a guy who came up listening to Nirvana, and Alice in Chains and the like. I honestly like this entire record, and you will too. Like some other reviewer said, if you don't buy it. you're missing out. This came out 18 years ago, and I've missed out on the 9 other hidden gems that are on this record. Seriously, Buy it, you won't regret it. And also check out Linda's other solo recordings. Equally outstanding.-Phiber Optik"
2,One-hit wonder,"This is definitely a one-song CD. The remarkable ""What's Up"" is a catchy tune with good lyrics, a killer hook, and great vocals, but the rest of the collection is barely above garage band quality. How, in only 11 songs, did they manage to include every tired rock cliche you could think of? It all seems to have been hastily put together, perhaps rushed out to take advantage of the popularity of ""What's Up."" Even the liner notes look thrown together--cheap graphics, without even a picture of the band. This group might have a future, but they need a little more rehearsal time."
3,3 stars for 1 great & 2 good songs,"Linda Perry is obviously a powerful singer-songwriter-instrumentalist, although this interesting little curio from the early '90s is not necessarily the showcase for her.Except for the timeless classic ""What's Up"", and the magnetic and melodic ""Dear Mr. President"", and the defying-all-description ""Drifting"" (with an unidentified instrument - an electric oboe?), we have alot of material that's just a bid difficult to sort out.Perry seems to be a big fan of Heart, Led Zeppelin, and Chrissie Hynde, and on too many tracks we get too big a gulp of such a mix out of the musical blender. Her voice is powerful, but hopelessley lacking in dynamics, save for ""Drifting"", where she reaches high for afew notes and provides some relief from the ""Brass In Pocket"" sonics.You may find this CD in the ""Used CD"" bin - not to promote such practices - but get spellbound by that incredible track - you know the name - look up the track number.Beautiful artwork and booklet."
2,Music's too sluggish for Linda Perry's strong voice,"This album is a little too sluggish at times. While I like What's Up, the rest of the album struggles to find an identity. Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992. But the strong standout is Linda Perry's strong vocals. She sounds like she's not having it! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut. But the music doesn't really match up. Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy! She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music. Don't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show (which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days) about this band--she's too busy making hits for the masses and I'd rather hear her do that now!"
3,One song on this CD worth listening to.,"Let's face it--""What's Up"" was their only hit but it's worth buying this CD for it. (Also, it wasn't released as a single). The song deserves to be heard. Linda Perry's musical genius flowed through the song and captured every person's desire for emancipation from this patriarchically-dominating world.The rest of the album isn't as ambitious as ""What's Up"" but this is the only reason I bought this CD."
2,I give it a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10,"Really... I have to be honest... ""What's Up"" is really the only good song on here. Sorry. The last song was ok I guess... although I can't remember it too well. I'm looking for things to impress me but I'm just not finding it."
2,Painful Save for One Song,"""What's Up"", the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune (which, I always thought, would have been the perfect song for Heart), is the only thing good here. The rest of this album is a mess. Linda Perry has, of course, gone on to better things."
3,Music is the star,"A movie, for me, is a collection of moments, and Music of the Heart has one great one: when Meryl Streep walks onto the stage of Carnegie Hall and is greeted by Issac Stern. The violinist and concert hall's caretaker is a gem as he tells Streep, who teaches violin to schoolchildren in Harlem, she can hear the sounds of Horowitz and other musical giants resonate through Carnegie. It's a moving moment in what is pretty stardard bio-pic fare about Streep's struggle to keep her classes going amid budget-cutting. Stern and a host of other talented musicians who helped the teacher with a benefit concert play themselves. The DVD includes the documentary on which the movie was based and a short feature on Carnegie Hall, probably making it a little more worthwhile."
3,Heart-warming film with Streep in top form.,"This is one of a handful of 1999 Oscar nominated films containing no violence whatsoever. Streep gives an effective, restrained performance (earning her twelfth Oscar nom and tying with all time nom champ, Kate Hepburn). The original song also got an Oscar nod. It is a heart-warming film of a woman's dreams and their eventual fulfillment- highly recommended for the whole family."
4,Music of the Heart,I really liked this movie. It's about a divorced single mother struggling to get a job teaching music. She gets a job in a not so good neighborhood and starts a violin program because she feels any child can learn to play the violin. It shows with perserveriance anything is possible.
5,True Story,Hard to believe things like this still happen But I'm so glad they do ! That is why I had to get this movie for my collection !
5,heart warming,this movie is fun loving and will make music in your heart. meryl streep is great in this movie. she shows a passionate love for her teaching and her music. she never gave up on teaching any one that wanted to learn or not. a great family movie to make your heart sing.
5,Music of the Heart,"This very inspiring true story touched me so much that I selected it for a gift. The order was filled, shipped and received very quickly. Thank you. Great job."
3,"""Extras"" listed on DVD cover NOT on DVD!!","I don't have anything to add to the other comments about the film itself, but I was flummoxed by the fact that my DVD didn't include several of the ""extra"" features listed on the box. I don't miss Ms. Estevan's video, nor the bits of ""wisdom"" but I'd have liked to see the deleted scenes and more of the ""behind the scenes at Carnegie."" The Fiddlefest was, I know, quite a wild time with the audience thrilled by the combination of students and pros, and the pros were deeply impressed by the students, by all accounts, so to have seen how it all came together would have been nice. I also don't like paying for things I don't actually get."
5,Great movie...,"If you're a fan of Meryl Streep, feel good movies and music movies, this is one you should see. Based on a true story, Meryl Streep plays a divorced mother of two looking for a way to get back on her feet. She finds out she can make a difference as she starts a violin class for students at an inner-city school. But it seems that just as it looks as though she will have a permanent place in the school, the funding for Arts is cut, and she, the students, parents and staff must find a way for her program to stick around."
5,"""Music for MY Heart""","Meryl did it again! Another Oscar-nomination and like everytime: she diserved it like no other! One of her best films since ""One true thing"" and ""Deads become her""! Our greatest actress of all time in one of the best picture of this decade! This movie contens a lot of clasic music and a lot of imotional feelings and a speciall treat: ""Gloria Estefan"" and ""Angela Basett"" in a doublepack prettier and better than ever! Directed by ""Wes Craven"" creater of ""Scream""! He showed us what his real talent was!"
4,A Film Full of Wonder,"This film is a wonderful example of the power of music. It is well- acted, fun to watch and just makes you feel good all over, especially since it is a true story. Meryl Streep, as always, amazes us with her grasp of the forceful character she portrays and the children are a totally delightful bunch of ""supporting (although sometimes reluctant) players"". We,the audience cannot refrain from standing up and cheering them on and then shed a few tears for the sheer beauty of it. All in all, a great film experience."
5,"Great Movie, Great Buy","An all in all great movie and inspiring story. Also as usual, Amazion was the bargain for it."
5,Very Good,Good Movie Merly Streep is a good Actress and played a really good part in this movie she sure can act.
4,What a Lady. What a voice!,"The Best of Lee Aaron gives a great cross section of songs from Lee's rock career, I prefer the later stuff like Watcha do to My Body, Some Girls Do & Hands On. Any fans of Lee Aaron should give her 2 latest releases a listen (Slick Chick & Beautiful Things) they are really cool. Her voice is like an angel whether she is singing rock or jazz/blues. It is a shame she doesn't receive the recognition she deserves."
4,Lee Jeans Wrinkle Free,"Inexpensive, tough, nice style, good fabric, fits and seats well. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,Great slacks,Weighing 300 lb I often have trouble finding slacks that fit comfortably. These Lee slacks do!
3,Lee jeans,"Wow, I don't know if these were mismarked or what but I purchased a pair for my husband and though I ordered the size he wears, he couldn't get them on. They either run way small or they were mistagged. They appeared to be really nice pants and I wished they had fit. I did send them back and I did not reorder as because they didn't fit I had to pay the shipping back and wasn't going to keep paying shipping until I found a pair that fit him."
4,AWK Khaki Pants,Bought for skinny son with long legs. Good fit and great for a teen with the wrinkle resistance.
3,A little too short pants but otherwise they are a great quality pair,"Nice looking pants.A little too short in spite of the fact that the inseam(32) it's actually like a 30 or something, unfortunately."
4,Very comfortable and no ironing,"So far these pants have not remotely needed an iron. The are also very comfortable to wear. I cannot comment on how well the lines fit my body but my wife likes the look well enough. They are fine for normal days at the office although I would not wear them on any type of formal occasions. My rating is 4 because I do not know how they will wear over time, which is a very important feature in clothing to me."
1,Lee Men's Wrinkle Resistant Pants,their 34 34 was not. They are more like a 33 33. Liked the color but they are definately going back.
3,"nice pants, run long",The fabric is nice and my husband says they're comfortable. The waist is an accurate 32 but the length is about 4 inches too long for my husband who normally wears a 30. I can hem them so it's not an issue but for guys who don't have a seamstress in the house and don't want to pay to get them hemmed I would avoid the product. I'm surprised because my husband always wears lee and this is the first time there has been such a huge size discrepancy.
3,Price and Quality,"You got what you paid for. These pants have an average quality which I believe is what your money worth. If you're picky, this is not the pant you should buy."
4,"good, but not for summer","good, but feel hot in summer time, should feel better in spring, but my legs feel itch at first 2-3 time. what cause that, maybe the chemical treatment when they produce this pants, I don't know. you may want wash the pants 2 times before you put on it."
2,nice but snug,nice pants but are cut small for a 34 x 30. i usually wear a 33 or 34 in the waist but these are exceptionally tight. order a size larger.
4,good but,"The pant it's very nice, but i felt more than a 33 that a 34 (that size was i bought), so i recomended if you want to buy it tray a half size more. I felt this pants smaller than my 34 jeans."
2,"Stain resistant, comfortable; but frail","These pants are very comfortable and water just rolls off of the surface. However, after only a month of use, I got a giant rip in the groin. It's not even on the seem! The seem itself is fraying though. All I do at work is wash dishes and drive around on deliveries. This should not have happened."
2,Baggy,"Obvious too baggy for me.However, the material is good value for the money.. If you like this style, it is worth every penny."
4,nice pants,"Nice pants, they fit well and are comfortable, look so classic. really like them but would like to have more colors..."
1,"Seams split within two weeks, not quality pants.","I ordered these for my husband for work, within two weeks the seams had split. Cannot return, will have to sew and patch pants. Next time will spend the money on a higher quality pair. His Dockers have lasted years."
2,Not true to color - did not last long,"I ordered black pants, but when they arrived, they were not a true black. More like a dark navy blue, but definitely not black when compared to other black pants I own. But I wore them anyway, until this week when they tore for no reason. They were definitely not too tight, but they just didn't seem to be as high quality as the last pair I had, and the fabric was quite thin. These used to be great pants for everyday business casual wear, but I guess it's time to change brands."
3,comfortable and practical,"i have been wearing these pants for the last 7-8 years , and they have been very comfortable and practical. The only problem is that i have found the quality of the fabric used to be inferior in the last years compared to what i used to experience in the begininng years of purchasing these pants with the pants ripping after a few months of use in the inner thighs."
2,Disappointment,I have good experience with Lee casuals through Essential Apparell in the past but something has changed. Orderd the same style as I wear now but the fit is inconsistant........not sure if I'll stay with the 'tried and tested' or look for a new label.
3,Not Comfort Fit Waistband,"Just a word of caution, these are not a ""Comfort Fit"" waistband, just a plain waistband that is described as ""comfy waist band"" on Amazon, not what I thought it was. Misleading in my book."
4,Nice Pants,Very pleased with the pants. Fit great and feel good. Would buy again. Price was well within the range of the affordable.
3,pants,"The pants were well made and arrived on time. I just should have tried them on, and now I am not sure of returning them."
1,Smelly pants,"When I received the box from Amazon, pants was smelling like rotten fish, I returned them immediately."
5,Amazed!,"I really love this. High quality metal that works with a 52mm tulip hood. I wish they would use the mm symbol rather than ""mm"" but it still looks great and works well."
5,videographer,This product is very good quality.I needed a 43-52 step-up ring for my camcorder and this adapter filled that need.Great price and fast shipping.Highly recommend this product and seller.
4,The Garden,"I was dying to read this book. Immediately reading the excerpt about Adam and Eve and the Serpent and God, I was automatically interested in a concept many people have very different views on.I liked seeing the Serpent as Eve's mentor, but later when they made love, I knew they weren't going to be together (duh), but I was still kinda rooting for them.The part with Eve's rape was an eye opener for me. It's the first time I've read something with rape described more and reading Eve cry out in pain over it.Because God was put as a character who merely saw Adam and Eve as entertainment of toys and if he got bored of them, he would've probably send them away. I was very frustrated with God's lack of understanding on the pain he made Adam inflict on Eve, and his failure to even begin to comprehend and see Adam and Eve as real people. He only thought of himself and didn't think of their happiness let alone being able to actually to see them as more than just people he created."
5,A powerful new look at a familiar story,"From a completely non-religious standpoint, The Garden is a work of art in character prose. Adam, Eve, God and the Serpent are beautifully flawed characters, springing to life in Aidinoff's vision of the Garden of Eden. This book brings a whole new perspective to the story of Adam and Eve, one that is wholly more believable that what the Bible tells us. A personal favorite wasAidinoff's portrayal of God: not the perfect, beaming grandfatherly figure, but a rather selfish and egocentric genius who forces Adam and Eve to recite His praise during their lessons. This book is beautifully written and planned out, and even though you know how it ends, The Garden makes you question how Adam and Eve arrived at that end."
1,Just know what you or your child is getting into . . .,"The Author's Note at the end of the book really should be read first by the parent or child to shed light onto the actual agenda behind the book. The author admits to being anti-established religion, and anyone of orthodox Jewish or Christian faith would be scandalized by the text. In short, Eve has sex with the serpant, who is ""good"" while God is ""bad."" And, in the end, Adam and Eve become little gods of their own. Beware."
1,The Garden,"This book is the story of the Garden of Eden. If you are looking for a story that is similar to the story in the bible, this would not be your book. It is very different from that book in many ways; first of all Adam and Eve are raised by the Serpent and God, instead of being on the own. Eve and Serpent travel outside the Garden to see the world. The Serpent raises Eve and teaches her until she meets God and Adam. Then Eve takes lessons by God with Adam for a while until they are adults. Then in my opinion the book turns sour. God wants to test out reproduction and forces Adam to rape Eve. I stopped havig interest after that mainly, but found Eve and the Serpents travels interesting. I did not enjoy this book at all because it was very slow moving and had some gross stuff in it. I would not reccommend reading this book."
1,Note to Ms. Aidinoff--Find Another Job,"I love the fact that we live in a country where artistic freedom is encouraged and even embraced. However, like many freedoms, it is abused and taken advantage of. Case in point, this book. Ms. Aidinoff wrote this book, not as an outpouring of creative genius (it was sorely lacking), but in order to spead lies and half-truths about a God who millions worship. Aside from the fact that it presents a skewered view of the creation story, it is poorly written and executed. Unfortunately it will probably receive more attention than it derserves due to shock value rather than merit. There are way too many good books out there to waste you time reading such a lousy one!"
3,"Big Spurs Fan, SMALL Cards","My wife got these for me because I enjoy card/board games and I am a big fan of Spurs basketball. Unfortunately, the cards are much smaller than the typical UNO cards, so they don't get played with much. Had she realized they were so small, we would not have purchased them."
4,"Great, but Ed didn't take the new photos","A beautiful book that delivers, visually, what it promises, but:As Francesco said, Ed didn't make the new 2004 photo series.I find this a little misleading. With the title implicit, I assumed that Ed would actually have been the photographer of the ""Now"" portion, only to find in theend credit pages that another fellow took the photos. This fact REALLYlessens the artistic value and integrity of the piece for me. I know thatmany artists and photographers use assistants to do work for them that they eventually sign their name to, but this is over 50% of the piece and I find it a bittoo ""detached"", considering Ed's terrific history of photographic art. That said, Hans Grunert (the 2004 portion) is a wonderful photographer."
4,"Cross-Roads of Tragedy, Music and Philosophy","""Birth of Tragedy"" can be stated as the first study off the hands of a master, concerning the European thought while establishing cross-roads between theater and music. According to Nietzsche, who approaches diverse philosophical problems along paths other than European philosophical tradition, thinking man is defined as creative, progressive and productive. His superior talents qualify him as one of the ""über-mensch"". Tragedy too embodies an application quality which makes its way through the dephts of human nature with the aid of music. Thus, this study is among the works which represent the intellectual personality of Nietzsche excuisitely."
2,Pretty hard for seniors,I bought this for my elderly parents. When I went to see them I plugged it in and thought we would all do it together. I was just OK. The music was good but the steps were very fast. Some of the movements they did in a chair and some they did standing with their walkers. One movement that really was very hard and made me worried was deep forward lunges. Yes lunges! I am in pretty good shape but lunges hurt my knees and I think is was a dangerous move to put that in a dvd that many seniors will watch. I would not recommend this dvd for any older adult.
5,Hamilton Beach Brew Station,This is the second Hamilton Beach Brewstation we have had. I have RA and it is the best coffee pot cause you don't have to pick up the heavy glass pot of the other machines. The coffee is so good my friend comes from SC to get some coffee. We really like this product.
3,had a clock issue,"Just got this coffee maker on 4/16/2009,brought it to my office only to find out that the clock display is defective. I'll return it and wait for it's replacement then write my update later."
2,"Easy to use, Save your receipt and warranty!","Love this unit, easy to use. Stopped pumping water after about 6 months of use. Found warranty and receipt I had fortunately saved, warranty states 1 year replacement at no cost to consumer. Great, called the 800 number provided. No problem, cut the cord off and send with copy of receipt and check for $10.00. Whoaaaaaaa, warranty says no cost to consumer, after several being put on holds was informed they would wave this time only, HUH??? I guess consumers interpretation of no cost and Hamilton Beach is not the same. This was 2 weeks ago. Called this morning and was told it should arrive tomorrow, good thing Starbucks near, but could have purchased a new unit for what I spent there on coffee over last 2 weeks waiting for my (fast ship) replacement. Summation, I would buy again, but probably 2 units so as to not be out of my beverage for 2 weeks when one of them breaks again."
2,Shuts off after making 2 cups,I purchased the 10 cup model and about a month later it quit pumping after making 2 cups. I had to turn it off and back on every 2 cups it made. I took it back to the place of purchase and swapped it for another one. It has been almost the exact same amount of time and it quit pumping again. I like the concept and the maker design but they really need to improve the pumping system.
5,Great Coffee,"Love this product.There is no bitter taste, and the coffee is super hot. We enjoy our coffee every morning, and even go back for more which we never did with our other coffee makers. If your looking to start the day with agreat tasting, hot cup of coffee the Brewstation plus is the way to go.It's easy to use and no carafe to break. Use short or tall cups including travel mugs.If you buy this product you will be writing your own review to tell others how great it is.This is the first review I've ever written about a product."
3,NOT HOT,"I had read a lot of reviews about this coffee maker and most were positive. The coffee maker works great and I love the convience. But, the coffee is not hot. I was very disapointed about that."
3,"Great coffee, but....","We've had this coffee maker for two weeks, and we really like the coffee it brews. However, there are a few things about it we don't like: 1) the level of coffee still in the reservoir is hard to read. We tip it sideways while shining a flashlight on the indicator to see how much is still in there. 2) We agree with other reviewees that it is difficult to judge just how much water we have in it (hard to read). 3) It is difficult to pour the water in without spilling. We don't have any problems with leakage, thankfully. But the coffee does taste good."
4,Brewstation,Excellent. We've used the carafe-less coffee makers for years. Two HB brewmasters and last year the Cuisinart 2000. I never could fill the Cusinart without spilling water. This one works far better and is half the price. This is the 5 button model with a strong coffee setting. Seems to work.
4,Works Well,"This product does what it promises - it is easy to program and delivers a good cup of coffee. I like the 1-4 cup feature.I gave it a 4 because it is larger than I expected - takes a lot of counter space, and you can't put it under a cabinet because it steams. Coffee is not very hot when first brewed, but gets hotter if you let it sit for about 20 minutes."
5,Hamilton Beach 47686 Brewstation Plus Coffemaker,This is an excellent coffeemaker. It is the first coffeemaker that actually prepares 1 to 4 cups as well as it does 12 cups. The extra taste brew works without making the coffee too strong. I highly recommend this product for home use.
5,Very happy with no problems,"I read all the reviews that stated that this coffee maker leaks... it doesn't. I have had no problems with it leaking. Perhaps a few were sent out from the factory that had quality problems, but I haven't found any problems with mine so far. I like this coffee maker very much. I've never had a programmable one before, so I'm enjoying that feature along with the 1-4 cup choice and flavor+ buttons. I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,"Update on my ""no leak"" coffeemaker","2/14/08 UPDATE- My coffeemaker stopped working last month...just upped and quit. Lights were on, timer worked, but no coffee. Am currently awaiting a replacement. I'll update this review as necessary. It was perfect while it was working...11/22/07 My husband bought this for me after seeing it on tv. It is an amazing coffee pot for the price and does exactly what the ads claim. It brews great coffee, is programmable for 1-4 cups, decaf (keeps it at a lower temp so you don't get a bitter taste, extra strong flavor setting and you can program it the night before so that it is brewing when you get up. It also does not have a warming pad so the coffee doesn't get overdone and it shuts itself off after two hours. I also like that it has a dispenser in front for you to fill your cup and the entire back comes off so you can take the pot to the table to serve if you have a sit-down table situation."
4,Good so far,"I was nervous about getting this because it's different. I had a coffee maker with a carafe previously and liked it but sometimes found it didn't stay as hot as I would have liked. So far this machine is working out great. Even my skeptical husband likes it. I agree with the other reviews that the way you pour in the water is a bit tricky --especially if you have the machine on a counter that is under a cabinet. The top has to be completely up. I put the coffee maker on a place mat and pull it out to put the water in. I never noticed a plastic taste. So far it seems to stay pretty hot. It's neat to be able to pour on demand. It's difficult to see how much is left in there, but maybe I just need to get used to reading that indicator."
1,Amazing!,"This is amazing. I did a review a week or so ago and cannot find it on the Amazon site. Basically, it agreed with ALL the earlier reviews of the BrewStation and BrewStation Plus that this product is faulty. I don't understand why the other reviewers haven't commented on the fact that all these products, and especially the Model 47686 - LEAK! No way to repair them! Customer service and quality assurance totally lacking!"
2,6 months later...,"I bought this product 6 months ago and I'm kicking myself for not returning it right away. I thought this product would simplify my coffeemaking. I was wrong. If you think not having a carafe would make this easier to clean up, it doesn't. And pouring the right amount of water requires multiple steps.It does brew a good cup and it doesn't leak. But if your looking for a simple product this is not it!"
2,Warm coffee - and 4 cups means 2,"I have to say, we were disappointed with this purchase. We tried the 4 cup setting and looked forward to savoring some Dunkin Donuts ground coffee.When it was ready, filled two regular size coffee mugs and tried it. It was warm, not hot - warm enough that you can just drink it down without sipping. Now I'm not a fan of ""so hot you can't sip it without burning your lips"" and ""waiting 10 minutes for it to cool down"" hot, and I'd read in other reviews that it wasn't going to be piping hot, but I would like my coffee hotter than this, preferably giving off a little steam too.It was also pretty weak - again other reviews mention the need to push the ""extra flavor"" setting. I don't see why you need to use special settings to get a reasonably strong cup - subject to the grounds you use of course.In any case we decided to clean it up, pack it back up and send it in for a refund."
1,very disappointing,"I had an oringinal brewmaster, but the lid broke, so reading all the reviews I decided on the brewmaster plus with 4 hrs warming. It comes with no water filters, the water fill sign was on constantly even with water in it! I have returned it but it is not to amazon (another company) and I am still waiting for a UPS label. Never again will I buy from another company through Amazon. They should have the same return policy as Amazon! Also the baskets from Hamilton Beach are too small for this unit."
4,Good Coffeemaker,"We purchased this coffeemaker after seeing a similar one at a friend's house. We have really enjoyed not having to use a carafe. It does make good coffee and it keeps it hot as advertised.The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish the fill lines in the water reservoir in the front was a little bit easier to read. It is hard to tell how much coffee is in it sometimes. Also, it would be nice if the reservoir in the back had measurement lines so that we could fill it directly with water from our sink's sprayer faucet instead of having to fill up the front reservoir and then pour it into the back."
4,I love this coffeemaker!,"This is my second one of this coffee maker. The first one was used so much that it just gave out. The only problem with it is that I have to pull it forward on my counter to pour in the water. The coffee is delicious, the perfect temperature and never has that burned taste. I love the ""flavor"" button. It allows me to use less coffee and still have the full flavor."
4,Recommended - this is a wonderful cookbook,"I used to borrow this book from my roomate. The recipes are real, basic dishes that Indians eat, with no gimmicks or ""spin"". I bought other cookbooks, but none had the comprehensive, well-rounded recipes like this one does. So, now I'm buying my own copy. I only wish there could be an update - with pictures and more modern language."
5,Best buck I ever spent!,"Bought a paperback version of this book for 16 rupees (about $1.00) at a huge bookfair in Calcutta in 1987. Best Indian cookbook I have ever seen. If you love Indian food and want simple recipes that are quick to make, delicious, and nutritious, this book is for you. Mine is a paperback version, published on what appears to be cheap paper but has held up well for over 25 years and is worn and splattered from use!"
1,Life Is A Series of Presentations,"Hopeless. The worst audio book I have in my collection. Nothing like I was expecting. If you want an book titled Tips For People Who Make Presentations at Seminars or Conferences, this maybe the book for you."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a book on presentations and was disappointed. The book had some anecdotes about the author's life that were okay but I was left uninspired. Of course, every encounter you have in business can be judged just as if you were doing a presentation, but this needs to be the subject of a whole book? I don't think so.Wrong book for the right person; wrong person for the right book."
3,A Good Book for Those Wanting to Become Better Socially,A great book for those who want to succeed in business as a person who knows people or to just improve your all around social skills. Looking for a book on presentations in public speaking situations? Look elsewhere.
4,Actually worked,"After doing some research and talking to a LC I decided to try this product w/ some reservations. I figured it was worth a try to boost my milk supply. It actually worked. I didn't see much of a difference taking 1 pill 4xs as per the instructions 1st recommendation, but I noticed a big difference after taking 2 pills 3xs a day (also per instructions). I did, however, quickly run out. I ordered a second bottle and found that my supply has re-established at a much higher production rate, and I didn't take any more of them. Also expect to be a little sweaty and to smell like maple syrup after its gotten into your system. The payoff was good and I would purchase them again if necessary."
1,Did not work for me,I ordered these tablets two weeks ago and noticed the day I took them my Milk supply was lower by 2-3 oz per pumping session. But the day i did not take these I had better than normal milk supply. So not sure if there is a co-relation. But now I am stopping to take them altogether. BTW brown rice works better for me.
2,Not worth the price,"I was very disappointed in this product. I believe it may help a little, especially if you already make a good amount of milk. But if you are like me and are barely able to eek out a little milk even when pumping every two hours, I don't think you will see much of a difference. I think that it might be a better idea just to try Mother's milk tea which contains the same herbs."
4,Motherlove More Milk Plus,"This stuff works fine, but for the price I would rather just use plain fenugreek from GNC. It's much cheaper there for the fenugreek."
4,"It's good, but could be shorter.","I like this book and the quality is superb, the models are beautiful, and the poses are excellent. However, I thought that the same could have been accomplished in a smaller size and shorter version which would have saved on cost and price. It got a little repetitive as it went on, in my opionion.I highly recommend this book as one of the best ones out there for nude/erotic photography. It's classy and it really highlights beautiful female form with excellent lighting. What I also enjoyed is that the sets are all environmental and not studio. I hate those studio nudes that look so fake and posed. It was a good learning book for me."
2,disappointing,"the pictures are...frankly mediocre. I would suggest another one named Erotique--it's ligher, less expensive, and has better pictures."
5,Argentini's Master Work,"Breathtaking models, pleasing compositions, nice points of view, and enough eroticism to really hook me, and reel me in. I have to say I was very impressed with this beautiful and colossal master work.I'd also like to mention that many other photos I've seen of two women interacting look really staged and phony; however, in ""Private Rooms"" these are some of my favorites, because they convey such intensity and genuineness."
1,Not at all enjoyable,"Why is everyone praising this book? I wanted to like this book...because the writer is so young...and I thought that was pretty cool, but it was just...no. There was just nothing to like. It was dull, unoriginal, and listless. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Crazy,This was a okay book. It was just about a boy that got kicked out of a lot of schools. Now hes at this school. All he talks about is girls and thats about it. He sneaks off from school with some of his new friends and some things that shouldn't do. But others wise it teachers us what not to do and don't get kicked out of so many schools just be good.
2,Disappointing,"After reading numerous good reviews of Crazy in The New York Times and Salon.com, I was expecting a book worth my time. Unfortunately, my desire to read a good coming-of-age novel was not satisfied. More than anything else, it seemed that the book was about chicks and booze. Some of the book dealt with the main character's emotions, but half the time, those emotions were saturated with too much beer. If you want to read Crazy, borrow it from a friend or check it out of the library before you consider purchasing it. Or, if you are interested in reading a *good* coming-of-age novel, check out The Perks of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. It, too, includes chicks and booze, but are dealt with in a more heartfelt way."
3,Coming of Age,"These autobiographical novel recounts the school days of young Bejamin Lebert: disabled, facing his parents' divorce, failing out of school, and shipped away from his native Munich to boarding school. We see Lebert's coming of age and dealing with the trials of adoescence in boarding school. Lebert shares the loneliness of boarding school life with his fellow students, and they quickly form intense bonds. The book puts in stark relief all the hopes and fears a world of teenagers can produce. Ultimately, this is a touching look at teenage life."
4,Go for the untranslated version,"This is a great book for students of German to read. Get the untranslated version. It'll help you get up to speed on the current German vernacular. If your stodgy old English/German dictionary fails you, check the online LEO translator maintained by Technischen Universität München. It's free and translates many phrases missing in dictionaries. Aside from the learning aspect, the book will entertain you and give you a glimpse into the life of a teenager with a physical impairment. Definitely recommended for all those learning German."
4,This Was Crazy,"After reading this book I felt like I knew Germany a little better, and I really liked this author because he was so young. Although this was not a true story, you can tell that Benni has been through a lot and it shows in this book."
3,NOT Holden... Which is a Good Thing!,"""Crazy"" is the enjoyable story a semi-paralyzed German teen at a posh boarding school. Much has been made of the author's youth, and for a semi-autobiographical work of this nature it retains an unpolished tone and a genuine spirit that is sorely lacking in Salinger's magnum opus.Where Holden Caulfield is a literary construct for self-absorbed, boorish, pampered youth, Benni Lebert lacks any paradigmatic qualities. Labeling oneself as ""crazy"" is far more refreshing than petulantly calling everything and everyone around you ""phony,"" which is the most apt adjective one can use to describe Mr. Caulfield. Mr. Lebert is far less ""literary,"" but he's much less grating than his predecessor's bland, arrogant posturing.Some readers may find difficulty with the sometimes rough translation from German, but the youthful desire to get drunk and screw around transcends both national and linguistic boundaries."
3,crappy cd!,Get this cd for one song: Mouth. The other songs are bogus. The song Mouth rocks though! Besides you cannot find it on any other Bush album. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of Mouth.
1,Nothing Hurts Like Gavin's Mouth.,"This album is horrible. Gavin's Singing is worse than ever. There is not even a decent song on the album. Not only is the singing bad but the lyrics are pitiful they make no sense at all! And the electronic music is awful, especially against Gavin's voice. Gavin needs to ask his girlfried Gwen to help him with song writing because Gwen is an awesome songwriter, but unfortantely Gavin is not. This album is the worst one out of all Bush albums."
2,Remix Gone Bad,"I think the remix shouldn't have been done, because Bush does not have the type music to be written in a remix form. It gets really aggitating because it repeats the same line over and over again."
2,...BOOoo-sh...,"...'Deconstucted' does nothing to the benefit of the sound of the once virgin music of Bush. Now with its distortion, twisted, and corrupted sound created with 'Deconstructed', all i can say is that i lost some respect with them.This album is far from impressive, a bore, and a pain to listen too. I suppose it could grow on you if you like dance and techno, but overall i do not recommend this album what so ever..."
5,"Different, but I like it","I was a Bush fan long before this album came out. I enjoy it primarily because I like grunge, heavy metal, techno, and electronica in equal measures (and I come from the world-recognized hometown of remixes). The songs are definitely techno, so don't bother with this album if you expect vintage Bush. You'll need a good stereo to appreciate the heavy drum beat and bass present in nearly every song.The best way to sum up my feelings about the CD: I want a Deconstructed 2 disc with more remixes (in fact that is what sent me to Amazon searching for more Bush discs)."
4,"Few good, few ok...","It is a refreshing and rare album for some Bush fans who may have never heard it so it is a great pick up overall. You can't lose with the .mp3 files from amazon. I think the best song is Mouth. Of course everybody's taste in ""techno"" is something different, especially with the rise of dubstep 'music'... Anyways I don't know if they had different mixers on each of these songs or a few DJs shared the album or what but some songs are really good or decent and then others I just change the track immediately and I tell myself ""whoever this DJ was sucked""... maybe it was all the same guy. I havent done anything but listened to the album, I havent researched the history or the track info or anything like that. If you are really strapped for cash listen to the individual .mp3s unless the album is $5 then go for it."
4,Must have if you're a BUSH Fan,"If you're familiar with and a fan of Bush albums you're likely to enjoy several of the mixes. A few rival the originals, they're refreshing, they make a great burn mix with the standard BUSH hits. So 4 stars if you know the songs and can groove with the arrangements. If not, maybe 2 stars - it's not that approachable. If you are looking for a standard grunge you'll be disappointed - this is a techno mix. 5 Stars to BUSH for promoting some real creativity by other's music based upon BUSH's celebrity, quality sound & song writing."
4,"Mouth, Amazing!","I am a huge fan of Bush, but this album has left me a little off balance. The remixes of these songs are terrible, but two songs save the album. ""Mouth"" and ""A Lonely Place."" Ironic enough, these are both songs herd on soudtracks. But I manly want to talk about ""Mouth."" It's an amzing song of love run amuck. I really got into this song when a similar sitituation happened to me. The song gets 4 stars on it's own, but if you want vintage Bush, buy ""The Science Of Things!"""
3,Not as bad as some say....,"I didn't think this cd was a ""waste of plastic"" nor did it ""make me vomit"". If you set aside all negative comments you might have read regarding this album and actually listen to it, you'll find that it isn't bad at all. Not that Bush ever sounds this way in concert or in any of thier other albums. I can see how a Bush fan would be disappointed with this music, but if you don't enjoy the remix of Mouth on this cd, you are in complete denial. It is one of the greatest remixes I have ever heard in my life. I have no idea what else Stingray has mixed besides this song, but I gotta say he's the man! The rest of the cd is alright, not anything majorly exceptional. But if you don't listen to Mouth on this cd, you have no idea what you are missing."
2,what??,"i didn't buy the cd when it came out but now i listen to it i'm glad i didn't. I don't know how they were trying to sound but it sounds bad. Stick to the old Bush, that what i like."
3,Careful - This isn't the bush you're used to,"I've always been a big fan of Bush, and when I heard the awesome remix of ""Mouth"" I just had to have Deconstructed. Upon my first listening to the disc, I was suprised to discover that most of the rest of the CD was pop. Pure pop. And it made me wonder where Bush was in all this. It sounded like it belonged to a happy NIN cd. There are some parts I enjoyed a lot about this CD, some of the songs are very intriguing even though there's not much Bush too them. But none can live up to mouth. Either you'll love it, or you'll hate it. I, for one, have grown to love it."
2,This album is not what it should have been.,"I understand the point of remix albums as the original artists (or other artists/producers/etc.) want to make their previously released songs sound different. The issue is that Bush's music does not flow very well when it is remixed to electronic music. Bush's music would have come off better with industrial remixes. Instead we get bland 7:00 remixes of songs that sound like they came from rave clubs. People should turn elsewhere for a good remix album. Rob Zombie's ""American Music Made To Strip By"" is much better."
1,electro-garbage,"i am a fan of some electronica, but bush in nowhere near electronica. i thought maybe this idea could work. i had heard the remix of MOUTH and loved it. so, i went out and bought this album. huge mistake!!!!! it has nothing, i repeat, nothing to do with bush except for lyrics. please listen to this disc before you buy it. if not you may be sorry! i love bush but the only song on this album i honestly liked was MOUTH. heed my advice."
1,Stupid!!! How can anybody like this c.d.!!!,"If you like techno stuff with synthesizers and stuff, you'll like this album. The songs don't even sound like their original versions!!! Most of the songs don't even feature all of the lyrics. Such as ""Comedown (Lunatic Calm Remix) only repeats one line of the lyrics of the original song thorughout the whole song which is about 6 and a half minutes long. All the music doesn't sound the same either. It sounds more like 70's and 80's techno-pop than 90's alternative rock. So, if you're considering buying this c.d., I advise you DON'T!!!!!!! It is a complete waste of money! I have to force them to give me my money back!-Matt Laird"
1,Ryan's Review,"I was the biggest bush fan after I heard 16teen stone, I the got razerblade suitcase which is not bad but this CD just is a peice of crap x2. If you are thinking of buying this CD because you love Bush don't I made that mistake. If you love bush don't buy this CD and you will be telling them that you want new, good music. BOTTOM LINE-The only good thing about this CD after buying it and disliking it is that it fits nicely into the garbage can, if you get this album in cd form, place it in the microwave to se a spectacular sparks show, and you can throw the jewel case at siblings."
5,Bush Deconstructed,If you like BUSH and ambient/techno sounds then you will like this cd becaue it is a combination of the two. It's very well put together and you won't be able to put this cd away.[Also] There is also a known song in this cd: 'MOUTH'; which some may recognize from the movie American Werewolf in Paris.
4,"Bleah at first, cool at last.","Now I am a big fan of Bush, so when I first found out about this cd i didn't even wait to hear any of it, I just went out and bought it. It was a major disapointment, at first. In the beginning I only liked the first Everything Zen mix and Mouth, nothing else. But as time progressed, I did venture out into the other songs, and I found that many of them rock. As I listened to them, I found there relations to the originals. My fav song on this album is definetly 'Synapse,' it is the best. I also like Mouth, Swallowed, amd History. But one thing I don't get is where they got 'In a Lonely Place.' What the heck Bush song is that? Oh well. This is a really wonderful cd, and you might not like just listening to it at first, but trust me, it grows on ya."
2,Not what you'd expect,"I am a huge bush fan, but I have to say that this album is not up to the greatness that one would expect form this band. I loved ""Mouth"" which is the best cut off the album, and the only one worth listening to. This one was mixed by Gavin himself, which proves that only Bush can get themselves right."
4,Great Dance or House Music,This album is exactly what the title says. If you like house or dance music this is a very good CD to play at parties.
1,Only got one star because there were none lower,"This c.d was the worst purcase iv ever made. I saw ""everything zen"" and ""comedown"" so i bought it because i liked bush. I got home and got totally pissed when i heard it and the crappy remixs. Terrible c.d."
3,Mildly entertaining story of goofy characters,"The situtations and characters in this story about an old man who collects the writings of fish and his loser nephew are hardly realistic or convincing. I guess some readers would find the book ""charming."" I read it because a friend who reads a lot of books I recommend told me to, and it was short. The events depicted are pretty ridiculous and unlikely, but the likable characters held my interest. It has a cartoonish quality and would probably make a good movie vehicle for Jim Carey. It's just not my kind of book."
5,I laughed the whole way through!,This is the funniest book I have read in a very long time. People asked me what was so funny as I burst out laughing and all I could tell them is you have to read this book because you just have to be there.
5,Works Exactly As Described,"I love products that do exactly what they say they will. And these tablets do just that. Someone I met in a health food store recommended these when I could not find anything on the shelf that would help my 11 year old dog with stiff back legs and a hard fall a few years ago that bruised his spine and never totally healed. These tablets, given over a two month period, really helped -- and I could tell the difference when I ran out and it was a few months before I restarted him on them. Combined with someVenastat Natural Leg Vein Health Capsules, Dietary Supplement - 105 Ea(aka horse chestnut) to improve his leg circulation, someBioPreparation F2, andCOSAMIN DS CAPS Size: 60for the joints --- and he is starting to get up on his own again, climb into bed unassisted and run chasing after rabbits. They really make a mobility / lifestyle difference for him and he is happy to gobble them up."
2,"Painful to read, 30% of not obvious patterns","Some of the fonts chosen remember me of some books I read 15 years ago. There are bad recommendations like promoting a distributed architecture in the ""Physical Tiers Pattern"". The chapter describe how you can communicate between two processes with RMI or CORBA.The only two patterns that were not obvious for me were the ""Faux Implementation"" and ""Partial Population"", but few strategies are presented for implementing them.In overall, the author seems nave and not very experimented."
4,A great review of the past,This was a fun CD to listen to. It brought back many found memories of Hip Hop Days when the music was fun and good to dance to.
2,Unsatisfactory printing,We bought two copies of this book for our library. Many pages were in the wrong order.Returning too darn difficult.
1,Ick.,"Read this book at my son's preschool today and promptly threw it out. There is no place in my world for the message that: We are the ""best"", i.e., better than everyone else, AND other (i.e., older) kids are mean to us for no reason except that they are inherently sadistic, THUS we should terrorize and make fools out of them."
4,a good place to start to familiarize yourself w/ paul dianno,"i enjoyed this release very much,i've always been a fan of pauls and was my favorite of all iron maidens singers.while this release does have it's production draw backs it is a good representation of a very talented vocalist as well as showcsing some of his snogwriting skills.this double cd release is more for the person who wants to do some exploring.the first disc is better than the second but both are good.there are some good covers of old classics as well as original material,(writtrn by both dianno as well as others),and a few clasic iron maiden tunes as well,done live.over all,this is a very good place to star if you've heard the first two maiden discs and want to see what this original iron man has been up to. ian salazar"
5,Little bits of inspiration for writers of every kind,"Writing is a solitary business. Just you and the computer screen or blank paper. Yes, you can get feedback from friends and colleagues - but first you have to write something worth reading and often that is an uphill struggle.This little book is a compendium of inspirational bits and pieces. They're little fragments of inspiration or how-tos. Almost all are practical: ""The harder one works at writing, the more often the muse visits."" In other words, keep writing and the ideas will keep flowing. Don't write and dry up.For days when you're feeling down and can't going, even a cliche can be a spur to action: ""Sit down. Write a sentence. Now write another sentence. Write as many as you need until the good stuff comes."" I should tatoo that one to the inside of my eyelid.Overall, a little book that helps crank the engine of creativity. Nice to keep around.Jerry"
2,Artificial,"it doesn't state artificial flavorings in the ingredients list on Amazon.....but they are listed on the box. Not for me because of the artificial ingredients, but my husband likes the taste."
1,undrinkable,"I found this tea undrinkable -- the spice flavor is way too strong for me. ""Hot"" means ""completely numbs your taste buds"" here, not hot temperature-wise!"
4,"Better than the original ""spice"" tea","I've tried two different brands of cinnamon spice tea, and even though this is most likely derivative of the first brand, Harney & Sons' version is so much better. It isn't quite as bitter and the cinnamon gives you a more rounded taste, instead of being overpowering.The scent is intoxicating, and the tea tastes naturally sweet - its great for a cold day!"
3,Okay... but nothing compared to the loose version available in tins!,"I have been a long time fan of the Hot Cinnamon Spice Tea, though I had only purchased it in the tin of loose tea bags. I am sad to report that the flavor is vastly LESS flavorful than the loose version and certainly not as tasty.While still better flavor than many teas, I was disappointed with this in comparison with the slightly more expensive tin version."
5,Hot and Soothing,"If you liked Cinnamon Tic Tacs (no longer made), you will love this tea! This is a flavorable tea that has a robust (but not too bold) taste. I like drinking this tea after meals, like a soothing dessert. I already ordered more as this has become a daily drink!!"
5,Total Cinnamon World,Wow this is really spicy and cinnamony (if that is a word). A bargain really considering that you get 50 large bags in a box. I would advise that this tea tastes quite sweet to me without any added ingredients out of the box. So go careful on sugar. May I suggest pairing this with the wonderful organic agave cinnamon sweetner available through Amazon as a compliment. (ASIN: B0048INV38). This makes it a cinnabomb.
5,Love the tea,Really enjoy the tea. Glad it comes in boxes of 50 tea bags so it will last longer. It helps to curb my hunger as well.
5,Great!!!,I previously had this tea at a restaurant and enjoyed it so much I wanted to order some for daily use at home.
4,My New Favorite Tea,This might be my new favorite tea - the scent is just divine and it needs very little in the way of sweetening.
5,"My Favorite Tea, Hands Down","I really love this Tea!! It's my ""comfort food"" of sorts. It's very tasty with a little sugar-spicy and yummy. This was a really great price for 50 tea bags."
4,"go for the satchels in the tin, I guess . . .","If you LOVE cinnamon, this is apparently the tea to buy, especially in satchels in the more expensive tin. Based on the rave reviews, I bought the economical box - and, for a gift to have on hand, the nice-looking tin . . . before realizing that the satchels in the tin are touted to taste better than the 50 bags in the box. Glad the gift tea should be better! I LIKE cinnamon - but to love these tea bags, it would help if you love cinnamon (especially if you enjoy Red Hots or hot spicy food). I usually enjoy my tea strong and with milk, but I suspect I'll be diluting this one with lots of milk. So far, I've found Harney & Sons tea to be high-quality tea - and cinnamon is healthy, so I'm okay with this purchase. But I don't plan to restock this zinger in my pantry :)"
5,Most flavorful tea,"I first had this tea at a Starbucks & then ordered it for use at home. I love the strong flavors and have made it my routine hot drink. I will continue to order online as I have had prompt delivery without any problems with the product. I would recommend this tea to anyone who likes a strong, cinnamon/spice tea that is just perfect as it is... no cream or sugar needed.Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice - 50 Tea bags"
5,Wonderful tea,"This is a wonderful tea- the aroma is delightful, and the flavor- wow. This has become a favorite of mine-cinnamon, orange and clove combination is perfect."
5,The all-inclusive guide to London architecture of all eras,"This is a thorough treatment of London architecture, covering not only iconic landmarks like Buckingham Palace (although they're here too), but as well, buildings from all eras across Greater London. Post-WWII architecture is surprisingly well represented. The region is divided into a grid of 24 squares, each of which is illustrated with a detailed map (except outlying areas), and this grid is used for organizing the book into chapters. In all, over 900 buildings are included, each with a 2 inch x 2 inch photo and a description of three or four sentences. Floor plans are shown for each of Wren's churches and for a handful of other buildings. Appendices have maps showing 'The Great Estates,' London squares in chronological order, and 'The Inns of Court.'"
4,useful textbook,"I bought this book for a distance learning school. I purchased a ""used"" book due to the high cost of almost all textbooks these days. The book arrived quickly (within a week) and was in excellent condition! I'm tempted to keep it even after I have completed the school course but the resale might be worth it. It is a very large text, over 1600 pages and has a lot of good information in it."
5,The Next Generation was better than the first Echo video.,"I fell in love with Echo and her family. I was especially drawn to her calf Ely who has grown a lot since the first Echo video. Then along came Echo's next calf, the photogenic little female, Ebony. She's so cute. But Echo didn't forget about Ely. He got to nuzzle up to Echo shortly after Ebony's birth. The Next Generation is simply a fantastic look at the lives of this beautiful elephant family. I recently found out that Ely survived a spearing attack by a Masai warrior and Ely's protective sister Enid just gave birth to her first calf. I can't wait until the next Echo video!"
5,The Disappearance of Bobo Blando,"This is a cute book about the relationships between people. Bobo Blando figures, one way or another, in all the relationships, and is, himself, a mystery to all. I enjoyed it very much, and have recommended it to my friends."
3,"Could have given us more to work with, but still covers the USS Liberty coverup very well","Not many copies left so get one whileyou can. They may not do these in DVDs.Could have more eyewitness interviewsand some better pics/film clarity, butstill worth the look at least once. TitoHoward, a former Alabama bar owner's film'Loss of Liberty' is very good and highlyrecommended as well!"
1,Barely Interesting,"The Phoebe Chronicles lacks a number of things. Whatever sort of plot is has only acts to draw together two large sex scenes, which are generally boring, featuring strange angle choices. I'm amazed that it took two people to make this comic.Obviously the lack in plot is explained by this being the first in a series, but this beginning hardly makes me want to delve any further. Character development is confusing and random, characters appear and disappear without reason, and the story is pushed along by two page long info-dumps.This comic is almost insulting in its simplicity."
1,Give it a miss....,"This video contains three half hour programmes (The Ordinance of the Shofar; The sound of the shofar; and The Trumpet has sounded! Repent!) on the use of the Shofar in a Christian context. It is presented by Jim and Carla Barbarossa, the founders of Step by Step Ministries. The presentation is boring and amateurish and the use of the Shofar in a Christian context comes across as gimicky and unlikely to catch on."
4,A really fun B-movie with surprising depth,"This is a really fun (and somewhat violent) movie starring the late, great Pedro Armendariz, Jr., who transitioned last Christmas.Kind of a crazy story, but the more you watch, the more you get sucked in. Great late night viewing."
5,Beautiful just beautiful,"I recieved the Waterman Expert Black&Gold set as a christmas present. It's just beautiful, and it writes so wonderfully smooth. Every time I use I recieve compliments on it's looks. It was truely a wonderful gift to recieve,I love it."
5,the best I've ever heard,"I've been looking for this album for 5 years, tremendously glad I found it, this is some of the best music that's ever been.All the old albums by this band have the ring of truth to them, and they rock! Ken Hensley, Rock On, wherever you are!"
2,Completely Let Down.,"I purchased this product in the hopes that it would end my five year long battle with acne. All of the stellar reviews from Amazon had me totally conviced that this was the ultimate cure-all. Right? Wrong. As soon as it arrived at my front door, I Ran inside and literally used it three times that day. The Results? Non-existant. But I continued used thinking that i just hadn't given it enough time to REALLY work. Over a month later, I can safely say this product has done absolutely nothing for or against my skin; no refined pores, no cleared breakouts, no improvement in overall complexion. I felt the tingle people refer to after the application, but that's all that happened. Maybe I'm just that 1% that's doomed to not have success with this ""amazing"" product, or maybe the hype is just too good to be true. All in all, I would definitely not recommend."
1,Very Sad,"I have to say, this is a very sad book. Massimini's approach is very immature. The best way to explain his philosophy is that of ""the absorption of the self"". His view seems to be that we, that is the layperson, knows best. That we can find our own salvtation in our understanding of ourselves. The traditions of two millenium is patriarchial.... His obsession of knowledge as being the ""salvation"" of the human race is just arogance. This book is not for the seriious minded.... spend your money somewhere else."
3,would love it,"would really love this, BUT IT'DOES NOT COME ON KINDLE FORMAT. I WOULD PURCHASE ALL OF HER BOOKS, ONLY IF IT CAME ON E-READER FORMAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE EREADERS, BUT MS. WALKER'S BOOKS DO NOT COME ON THIS FORMAT. WHAT A GREAT NEW MARKET. YOU CAN REACH A LOT OF PEOPLE, (TRYING TO SAVE TREES), I'M GIVING UP TRYING TO BUY YOUR BOOKS, if you don't want to sell in an ereader format, that's your business. i'm not buying"
5,Anguish put to good use!,"This ep does not have the following that it deserves. It is insanely angry and that is what makes it great. ""Wish"" is an incredible slashing piece of rage as is ""Last"". This is what NIN is, or was, all about. Everyone who jumped on board with the weak Downward Spiral album should listen to this and then decide if they are fans."
5,Angst manifest,"Starkly contrasting to PHM, Trent Reznor shows that he is the best at showing anger and hate. Long live NIN."
5,Great EP - must have for everyone (not just NIN fans ;->),"This is one of the defining albums from NIN, and the one that keeps coming back into my CD player all the time.Just a couple of comments on the other reviews:Its an EP not an album - thats why its short ;-)Physical is a cover of an Adam Ant song - so thats why it sounds a bit different from the other stuff, its the only non-original ;-)A great heavy album that is fantastic live as well"
5,A Short Pure Hardcore Angst Great EP,"This is Arguebly NIN finest album when it comes to energy and anger......musically i think The Downward Spiral and The Fragile are better but this is more of a thrash album so if you think you will be getting tracks like Closer, Somewhat Damaged, look somewhere else anyways get this album it might take time to grow on you but its worth the wait"
5,"Better than ""The Downward Spiral""","This cd is like art.It expresses so much rage yet it is beautiful at the same time.If you are a NIN fan,or just like the whole idea of emotion,you should definitely check this cd out."
4,Broken record.,"Very good NIN ep that you could really just call an lp. I mean, there are alot of lp's with 9 tracks, and this has 8. Anyway, like others have pointed out, Trent seems a bit angry on this one. Broken reminds me of Ministry's album ""Psalm 69"", in that it's mostly fast and loud with alot of guitar on it. Definitely the most ""metal"" sounding overall of NIN's output. Some copies of Broken come with tracks 1-6 on the disc, and tracks 7-8 on a 3 inch mini-disc. I assume the initial copies. Cool to have unless you want them all on the same cd. Either way, Broken is as essential as any NIN before or afterwards."
3,Would have been great to get more songs,"This record has a couple of NIN's finest songs on it, there's no denying that. ""Wish"" is part of the alt-rock pantheon; ""Gave Up"" and ""Happiness in Slavery"" are both among NIN's best as well. For the most part, 'Broken' also does away with the cheesy 80's-ness of Pretty Hate Machine and gives way to the same basic sound that the band has defined as its own. There's more lyrical ambiguity on this one than the previous record, as well. It seems a little more respectable somehow when the rage, while manifest, is not as directed.Now, the bad. This is an EP. If they had fleshed it out with 7, even 5 more songs, this would probably be their best record. As it stands, it ends and you just wish there was more of it, so you go back and listen to ""Wish"" and ""Gave Up"" over again. I find that a little disappointing."
5,Very Interesting,"I started listening to NIN after finding out that Mr. Trent Reznor helped in the making of one of my favorite CDs, AntiChrist Superstar. And after listening to a lot of NIN, i can easily hear the link between AS and NIN's music. Which is good becuase i loved that CD and I'm happy that theres an entire band that sounds like that. Also, about the hidden track, thats the exact same thing they did on the AS album, adding around 90 empty tracks of blank noises to hide the last song."
5,Great!,"Broken may be short, but it is some of the hardest Industrial metal you can buy. It is definitely worth picking up, and is quite possibly Trent's best work. It is definitely up there with the best albums this band has put out. Every song is high energy, so get ready to rock, especially if you haven't heard this CD yet because it is awesome."
3,N ot Great and barely okay,The songson broken need more work and most importantly NO RICHARD PATRICK! he put his uneeded two cents in and messed up the CD. the videos they made suck except for happiness in slavery. I'm not trying to be a kill joy but I really think Trent would hve been so much better without Richard and I think the whole eletricuting and elephant clip on closure was a celebration that Richard left the band.
3,Balls to the wall and all that stuff,"8 tracks in reality, 2 of which are instrumental and all in all nothing in relation to Pretty Hate Machine this is where the Reznorites really get to sink their teeth into the hatred. Useful EP but ultimately this is the beginning of the end really"
5,I've found happiness in Slavery,"This is the best piece of industrial metal music I've ever heard. The album starts out with ""Pinion"" which is a low set of guitar chords that make you turn the volume up on your stereo. When Pinion rises and finally ends, you are suddenly blown away by ""Wish"". Definately a must have album for fans of seriously heavy industrial metal."
5,Trent at his Heaviest,Broken is without A doubt Nine Inch Nails heaviest cd.While only having eight songs it is well worth the price.All the songs on Halo 5 are great!As A note to the reader if you do not enjoy one Nine Inch Nails cd there is still A good chance that you will enjoy A nother one as no two of Trents albums are alike.
2,Juvenile,"Reznor's lyrics are perfect for angry teenagers. They are self-pitying, melodramatic, sentimental, and crassly served. I indulged this when I rode the bus to school back in the day, but certainly not now.NIN is one of those ""bands"" from the 90's that wasn't great enough to carry over into the sublimation of the 90's, the 2000's, much less was consciously aware of this process, and thus became a relic."
3,Poor Trent Is SO Unhappy!,"Here, Trent Rezner actually still sounds convincing angry, although not in an interesting way. Broken sounded like a monster when it came out, but it was the last gasp for Nine Inch Nails, everything that came after sounded like the band was aping it's clones, sad, but true. In retrospect nothing by NIN sounds all that exciting or special, it's just by the numbers angry music for angry teens. If ya ain't angry your own self, it just sounds annoying. Includes an amusing, kitchy cover of the Adam Ant Track `You're So Physical' which, like the rest of this album, seemed hip at the time. The disc includes the obligatory hidden tracks, which seem so clever to artists but really just make the album annoying to listen to, is the disc over? Seems like it's still playing, what track is this, 72? WtF?"
5,This is great!,"Broken is an essential NIN album to get. Songs such as ""Wish"", ""Last"", ""Happiness in Slavery"", track 98 and 99 are simply brutal, industrial, intelligent music. They made something in which you can feel all the anger, madness and raw power, and still be catchy and well-made and written. The rythms are nice and flow perfectly with the lyrics and some loud distorted guitar riffs top it all! Trent Reznor is a genius, forget all fakes, Reznor is there, and you'll feel him with Broken!"
5,Great Album,"I have never been a Nine Inch Nails fan but I love this CD. It is powerful and explosive. I particularly like the extra track, ""Physical."" The only downside to this CD is the long interval of blank tracks in the middle. It isn't so bad on a CD as it would have been on a tape, but it is still pretty annoying."
4,NIN's sharpest attack,"Classic stop-gap between two classic electronic releases, Broken helped balance out PHM's synthy-pop with DS's experimental terror in equal measure."
4,"Interesting, almost compelling","I must admit that I am not your average industrial metal rock fan, having grown up with Hendrix and the Doors and pushing 50. I picked up NIN's ""Broken"" on a whim in a drugstore sale bin and I can barely believe how this music has taken a grip on me. I love cranking it up on the commute home from work. It has a way of clearing out the mental cobwebs that no other music even comes close to. Some hear anger in this stuff. I hear a destructive, apocalyptic joy strangely combined with rage. It makes me want to scream, not in anger but in raw exhultation, a kind of celebration of being alive even though trapped in career and suburbia - true ""Happiness in Slavery""."
4,Battle Royal: TVT vs. Trent Reznor,"This, possibly the angriest record in the Nine Inch Nails catalog, is supposedly Trent letting loose a lot of hatred towards certain record company representatives. I don't really care about all that, all I know is that this is a great EP. Now, while I'll take musical greatness where I can get it, I could have gone for a full LP of Broken material (as long as it wasn't anything from Fixed). I suppose the best way to describe this album is as such; Distortion over-ridden guitars bludgeon your ears as Trent Reznor seethes hatred from his pores, and some neat keyboard plunking. Reminiscent of early Ministry, you can definitely spot the influence that ""The Land of Rape and Honey"" may have had on this album, but it still remains an example of Trent Reznor's mastery of organic instruments mixed with industrial chaos.Key Songs: Wish, Help Me I Am In Hell, Happiness in Slavery, Gave Up, Suck."
5,that's what i call music!!,"This is a great record. Seldom does a record capture real anger and rage quite so well as BROKEN does. My personal faves are ""Physical"" (hidden track #98 a cover of an Adam Ant song!) and ""Wish"""
5,Order In Chaos,"This is an excellent CD, and its only shortcoming is being too short. Its great how each song flows into the next one, and every one of the songs is a masterpiece."
3,Take this one for the next one,"This album is loud, angry, and, honestly IMO, not very good. I really don't like any of the songs on the album. Wish is decent. Help Me I'm in Hell is pointless to me. I don't get it. I give this album 3 stars just because this album blends its style together with Pretty Hate Machine to give us The Downward Spiral. I'm not trying to hate on NIN. I really like Trent's music, just not this part of it. Too vague, too loose, I'm not sure how to put it. It's not overly heavy. Chaotic might be the best way to describe it."
5,Metal at it's heaviest!,"This cd is a great improvement over Pretty Hate Machiene!You should buy it, unlike the remix cd, Fixed, this cd owns! Anyways, the main highlight tracks are 1) Happiness In Slavery, 2) Wish 3) Suck and 4) Give Up[Have fun finding the 2 hidden tracks!]"
3,An Angry album Indeed but a slump in Creativity,"For NIN standards this is a three but compared to any other band this is a five. This is easily the angriest c.d I've ever heard. Trent definetly knows how to turn feelings into sounds and lets you know where he's coming from and what he's talking about. Although this disc is good and the sounds are still fresh, I consider this to be a slump in creativity and sound. When compared to any of the albums, ""Pretty Hate Machine"",""The Downward Spiral"", or ""The Fragile"" it just doesn't hold up. Not to say that this is a bad c.d, I'd play this over any other c.d I have that's not by NIN but by NIN standards I just don't think it's up to par. Still when I'm in the mood for and angry album this is the first one I reach for."
5,Rage on CD,"Absolutely the best NIN disc. It is pure emotion... the music is aggressive and loud, screaming hate, while the lyrics speak of abysmal pain. I love every second!"
2,If you need step by step instruction - Keep Looking!,"This book is not what I anticipated. If you are somewhat familiar with Pagemaker it is a breeze. I waited for the mail daily just to receive a book that can't even help me. I ended up at the library checking out a 10 year old book that is still more effective in teaching me step by step instructions. It is called ""Pagemaker 5.0 for Windows"" it is 2 editions earlier but helps way better than this thing!"
2,Not as user-friendly as it sounds,"The other reviews are very misleading in that it is not a comprehensive how-to on the entire program, as it only covers matters of production in tabloid-formats and newspaper layouts. There is little to no coverage of any other types of publications that can be created using the program, and the langauge is NOT geared toward novices."
5,From the NKU Northerner,"I want to pass along the following from the Northern Kentucky University student newspaper: ""In a genre dominated by pointy-eared Vulcans and guys with lightsabers, people will soon have a new branch to focus on: anthropology-based science fiction. Sharlotte [Donnelly], professor of anthropology at Northern Kentucky University, has stepped into the world of science fiction writing with her new book, Kasker."" The Northerner"
5,Cassidy's Kds,Ellie Maitland was goal-oriented. She finished her masters degree at night. During the day she was the cheif administator of Maitland Maternity Clinic. Sloan Cassidy had 18 month old twin daughters and not a clue how to handle them. But he knew who did. Ellie Maitland. No way was Ellie going to let herself be roped into helping him with his little girls. Everyone knew he had broken her heart ten years earlier. Well except Sloan. And those kids brought out her maternal instincts she wanted to suppress. She still found Sloan way to appealing. Could she risk her heart again?When I got it it was pack really good and it got here real fast.
5,VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE,"I am very happy with my purchase. I've tried two other eyeshadow primers. One didn't do much of anything, and the other made the eyeshadow look gaudy. This one is just right. The eye shadow has just the right intensity without looking over done, and it stays on all day. As far as the jar being small, a little goes a long way.Frequently, I have alergies to cosmetics. Even if I like the product, many times, I can't wear it becasue my eyes get itchy and swollen. No problems with this one."
5,"A fun, silly book for the Harry Potter crowd","This book is a good one, and actually has some semi-serious spells to try, and information about creating a magic circle. However, if you're looking for a serious book on magic for kids, this isn't it! It's fun, funny, has a few neat ""wizard's illusion"" type tricks, tips on writing spells (including a goofy rhyming word glossary), a silly quiz to take, and a wizard identification card in the back. My 12 year old son thought this book was great, and I guess that's the true test. The rhymes used in the ""spells"" will have you cracking up!"
2,15 and 11 year olds opinion,The so-called spells were not very convincing. Simple stuff anyone could do. Wizardology is way more realistic to wizard-lore.
1,"Johnny Cash the line, walking with a legend",This item was purchase as a gift for homebound parents. the DVD would not play. I am not able to return this item due to it being in another area of the State. I can return it after a trip there in about two weeks.
5,way beyond cycling,"Kurmaskie may not have ridden in the Tour de France, but like Lance Armstrong, he pedals in a world where ""it's not about the bike"". This charming collection of tales from outside the lines adds depth to the carnival of characters Joe K. portrayed in his first book. This time the stories seem to have more suspense, and the characters speak more deeply about life. His story about the dumpster diver is a keeper, the riveting story of the ex-green beret working in South America could be a novel in itself, and the last chapter about his father is worth the price of the book. Bravo Mr. Kurmaskie, you are a tour de france winner on my bookshelf!"
5,One of the two best Yellowjackets efforts,"The other great effort was Four Corners. Many people don't know the Yellowjackets won a grammy for this album and were nominated for Four Corners. Once the saxophonist Marc Russo and drummer William Kennedy left the group the music just took a huge nosedive in my opinion. Bob Mintzer is a great saxophonist but to me his sound never felt ""right"" with this group. Marc just could never control his temper. It's a shame. I miss their group cohesion very much but I treasure these CD's even more for it."
1,"Good music, awful sax","What would have been a decent if not great fusion album is pretty much ruined by the horrible sax work by Marc Russo, who sounds like a cross between Kenny G and Dave Sanborn, two of the sax players I absolutely abhor. If you like them, chances are you will enjoy this album also, otherwise check out the jackets' later work with Bob Mintzer, who is miles and miles above these guys as a player and composer."
2,"An ""ADAPTATION"" I was trying to keep that in mind while watching","Well, it is certainly a different version of ""Loving Evangeline"" compared to the Linda Howard book. For those who have not read the book, this TV movie was very nice. Although, for this Linda Howard fan who did read the book and enjoyed it, seeing the made for TV version was very dissapointing. While reading the book I always imagined Robert Cannon being this incredibly handsome man in his late thirties as described in the book not a fifty something who wears glasses. But, that aside, other things bothered me as well, such as a new character added to the storyline and others deleted, there was also change of location and last but not the least what was up with Evies husband being dead only for a little while. I gave it two star because I am a fan of Linda Howard and was dissapointed how the book translated into this Tv version."
3,"Call the cops, there's been a murder!","Somebody has killed Linda Howard's novel and made it into a movie. You might want to add another star if you've never read the book. But, if you are familiar with Linda Howard's wonderful characterization and ability to tell a story, you will resent how it's all been reduced to this made-for-TV mish-mash.Apparently, it's almost impossible to capture an author's work on film without massive changes -- and there were massive changes made here. It's sure not what the readers would have pictured in their minds. The actors certainly are not bad, but I feel that they are not true to the book.Watch Loving Evangeline as something unrelated to Linda Howard's work, and you'll have a shot at some escapist entertainment. Expect more, and you'll be disappointed."
5,Perfect gift for people watchers....,"I purchased this book for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, as we both love to people watch in public. After reading the reviews, and being a long-time fan of vice already, I placed the order.I hit a home run with this gift. This is a thick book, but an easy read as it's broken into hilariously written short segments which hold your interest as long as you allow.I now often hear her cracking up in the other room, and no longer have to ask why - I know she's flipping through this book :)"
5,"Inner Monologue, please meet Outer Monologue","As the saying goes, ""If only we could see ourselves as others do.""This book gives you an unadulterated insight as to ""how others do."""
5,What are you all talking about this album is excellent,"I think reviewers are to critical on this album for all the wrong reasons. Unearth is a metalcore band and this album succeeds at being great in that genre. Its aggressive, has very catchy pounding riffs and awesome musical solos. By the way unearth do sound unique compared to all the other cookie cutter bands out there. Anytime an album can put an adrenaline rush in you is when it is the epitome of great metal. Unearth has done that in their first 3 albums. With this album they really excelled with the aggression and catchy hooks with Giles, Sanctity of brothers, March of the mutes."
2,garbage,"OMG! I can't believe all the hype around this band anymore, they used to be a great band when stings came out, and ever since they haven't made an album any where near that good. Oncoming storm was alright a few good songs here and there. The problem with this album is that its basically the oncoming storm with another ripoff riffs here and there. All this is, is the Same breakdowns you've heard OVER AND OVER AGAIN! with the same lame metalcore at the gate rip off riffs. And i used to be a fan of unearth and was eager for this release. What a Recycled crap of an album this is. Yeah so if you like your music to be unoriginal with the same riffs from other albums. This album is for you , but if you want somethign innovative and original check out there first Real Album ""The stings of Conscience"" Theres Tuns of better Metal then this today"
4,"Less Metalcore, more metal, you say? Yes, please.","There was a spot or two on here when I heard what appeared to be some thrash influence, but just ever so slightly.This album is one of those meant for repeat doses. The first time through, I noticed a few cool things here and there, but altogether ""okay"". The second time around, I started to ""figure it out"" so to speak and appreciate it. Now I listen to it pretty regularly.It's a strong album, and a step in the right direction and evolution for the band. Here's hoping they keep it up.""Sanctity of Brothers"", by the way, would be my favorite from this one."
5,Another Solid Album (4.5 stars),"Unearth is a band in today's metal scene that never fails to stand out, and I respect them for that. And they still continue to do that with their 3rd full length here. ""Giles"", the first single off this album, is a track that represents the band well, especially if you dig the stuff before this. Only real flaw may be the vocal work somewhat, but you can get past it if you're a real fan. Otherwise, if you really dig Unearth, or you want a good metalcore record, look into this."
2,Not good enough for either,"Basically this album is half thrashing guitar riffs, half metalcore breakdowns, with not enough of either to please dedicated fans of either genre.The technical riffs are pretty much amazing, but played throughout the whole song only to be stopped by a breakdown, which is the same breakdown for every song.Personally I am a fan of the technical riffs so every time the breakdowns come it's change song time, but I still get turned on by them from time to time if they are good. So to put it simply, I think they sucked. Terribly. What happened to writing original stuff.Oh and the vocals could be a tad more dynamic instead of the same ""I scream every word with a yaw sound thrown in instead of vowels"""
3,Nice look and features but substandard construction and overpriced,"The overmold on the wrist rest is only a thin layer that started to peel off almost immediately after purchase. Now, after a month, it looks horrible. The media pad often loses it's bluetooth connection and there is always a connection lag if you haven't pressed a button in a little while. I bought the unit ""used"" but still in the box and wrapped up as new and feel that it is overpriced at $100. I like the keyboard, mouse, & media pad... I just wish they worked better and that the construction was better on each component in the package."
3,Not my favorite keyboard,"This keyboard seems to lose its connection too often and then it takes forever to go through the steps of having to reconnect the mouse, and the keyboard and the media pad separately in too many laborious steps.I am very disappointed in the overmold on the keyboard wrist rest. I thought there was something on it and then realized that it was rubbing off. I am pretty fastidious about my electronic equipment and was extremely disappointed that it now looks shoddy and worn. Interestingly I have this similar overmold on the dashboard of my car around the cd player and that is wearing off also. I think it's a faulty design of the plastic manufacturers.I am really looking for a keyboard that truly is visible in darker situations and now that I am older I need more light to see to do anything!"
1,Buggy and doesn't last.,"Well, maybe it's not cool to have the same keyboard for just over a year. Maybe the idea is to keep buying new gear to keep companies alive; alas, my diNovo keyboard just up and died. Oh, it says it's connected via bluetooth to my Mac dual 2.0 G5 running osx 10.5.8, and sure it's got brand new batteries. But do the keys do anything? Nope. It's just dead. I'm long past my warranty so I'm SOL. Oh well... guess I won't be buying Logitech stuff anymore. So... anyone want to guess how much longer the diNovo mouse will last? I'm thinking probably a couple of months.Oh how I'll miss the hours wasted trying to get the thing set up as well.Good times. Good times."
1,Read this before you buy this one @!#%!,"I'm bitterly disappointed as I've been a Logitech fan for years but this product really disappointed me. There are two major flaws that not many people have mentioned thus far:1) The number pad's keys are smaller than the keys you find on a standard number pad. Even for my small fingers, that makes it really uncomfortable to use and I have to look down when I enter numbers. This pretty much disqualified this keyboard for my day-to-day usage and I would not have bought the product if I knew about this beforehand.2) The product has quite obviously some connection faults. As soon as my PC goes in standby mode, I cannot use the keyboard anymore and need to use my old keyboard to type in my password. This seems to be a common problem as some of my friends had the same issues."
2,Lousy technical support,"Things were fine until I allowed the update service to download new software. Once that occured, nothing worked. I dealt with Logitech's online technical support. Despite describing in my email to tech support that I had already done most of the things that technical support would require me to do, I had to start all over and go through each step that I had already gone through, only to have email tech support conclude after two weeks of this craziness that I should talk to their phone support. The product still doesn't work properly. Tech support was just frustrating beyond comprehension. The product is great when everyting works correctly. But run into a problem, and you're truly stuck. Logitech could do much better with their support, but they don't. If you have any technical understanding you will know far more than their robotic technical support people and will only be frustrated by their rote answers."
2,Wonderful keyboard - Awful mouse lag,"I love the feel and look of the keyboard (Though I wish it were all black, or at least a 'normal' alu-colour) but I constantly experience lots of mouse delay, rendering my PC completely useless for minutes at a time. It somehow starts behaving nicely again after a few minutes, but 15 minutes later I am again grinding my teeth as the mouse grinds to a halt and starts it's delay again.Two stars only because the keyboard really works fine, and the mouse laser tracks nicely on any surface I've tried (when there is no lag, that is)."
2,Great for light use,"Hi,Have been using this keyboard for a little over a year, and actually really like the keyboard. Would hope for better battery life on the Media Pad but do not really use it much.Great mouse.BUT - once you get a scratch in any of the rubberized surfaces you are in for trouble. They will quickly start to crumble and peel off. Unfortunately not in big ""just get rid of them pieces"" but in small little pieces that mostly resemble eraser crumbles. Very annoying -So if you are a light user it might be fine - but for somebody using this 16+ hours a day this is not what you want."
3,Works like a charm - only after coming up from idle,"The convenience of wireless is awesome. This product fills that need exceptionally well. The biggest complaint is that after sitting idle for more then 15 min the Bluetooth wireless connection goes into a low power mode to conserve the battery power (disposable batteries in the keyboard and media pad). When you begin typing the Bluetooth connection takes a half second re-connect. When it does, almost always repeats the first key touched. I am constantly deleting ""extra"" characters both the media pad and the keyboard create after going into idle mode. FFFFrustrating!"
1,Horrible Mouse Lag !,"I bought this thing over a year ago with high hopes for its sleek appearance and Logitech quality. There is something wrong with the bluetooth connection, the mouse, or whatever, and it has made the mouse almost impossible to use since day one. Every few minutes, the mouse experiences a ""lag"" where the cursor does not track where you are moving the mouse, in both speed and position. It is VERY ANNOYING.I have figured out a way to point the mouse away for a few seconds to fix it, but Logitech has no support about this or anything, and I have a wired mouse that I keep connected on my desk to be able to use in an emergency when the bluetooth mouse acts up. I do NOT recommend this product and I will be switching to another brand right now. I thought I'd enter in this comment before I purchased another one."
3,Ackward,Great connectivity. Easily installed. Works great. But the keyboard reminds me of my laptop. The keys are low profile and feel close together. It is a little clumsy for me. I would like to feel the keys more. I would trade the sleek looks for something that was more comfortable to use.
5,cord-free at last,"wireless keyboard is great. Feel of keys, functionality of kayboard is best I have used. Only complaint is position of caps lock next to ""a""; my big fingers keep hitting it by mistake"
3,Logitech diNovo Media Desktop Laser Review,"I bought it mainly for the thin design and the remote so I could control my music from across the room, but the spacebar key was not very responsive. If I focused on making sure I really pressed the spacebar it would work, but it typically messed up when I started typing faster; can't work with that. Good design, lacks on functionality."
3,Logitech diNovo Media Desktop Laser Keyboard,"Slow response time. Newer stock comes with USB extension for mounting bluetooth on table. When plugged in a desktop computer, it will not work properly. Documentation for pairing keyboard to CPU is not correct. Had to call tech support who indicated directions incorrect. Looks great but would not buy again."
3,Great - When It' Working...,"I've had one of these for a couple of weeks now.Pros: Good range, Media Pad is very Handy. Mouse is nice. Media controls are great.Cons: Lag! (Several seconds worth), Connection is constantly dropping. If you buy this, make sure you always have a traditional PS2 mouse within easy reach! Seriously. I have to go through the whole connection process about 4 times a week. Also the media pad has a stupid cursor layout. Be prepared to accidentally close your current app rather than scrolling down!I have a media PC under the TV and this keyboard is a very good setup for that purpose, but you seriously can't rely on it to work day to day. It simply doesn't.I'm starting to wish I hadn't thrown the box away."
3,Love it / Hate it,"Okay, let me state once I got everything working I really like this system. Installation was a serious pain in the butt. I have windows XP pro and had to run the installation 3 times before it was complete. I was also dissapointed that the keyboard requires batteries, although I never really had an indication it didn't. I bought this system to reduce the wires on my desk and to reduce battery useage. Neither thing happened. The keyboard takes 4 batteries (included) and you have a bluetooth charging station that requires it to be plugged in. Another wire and plug. I do love the ultra thin keyboard, and the mouse is pretty sweet... silky smooth."
1,Great hardware; appalling software - AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,Bought one of these desktop sets recently.Software installation wanted to do a bluetooth firmware update but it couldn't find the update.It tried to do the update on every restart and the only way to get the keyboard and mouse to work was to unplug/replug the bluetooth dongle.Eventually fond the firmware update and it's installer hiding in Program Files | local files | logitech and installed it manually.The keyboard and mouse now work on restart without replugging the bluetooth dongle.The setpoint software is the only problem now as it crashes about three times a day or so requiring a manual restart of the software.Not impressed given the high price of this set.Logitech - get your act together and sort out this appalling software.
1,DINOVO LASER PROBLEMS - what a shame!,"Right now I am hardly trying to write my review on my Logitech laser keyboard...it's a shame. Majority of customers hope the problem reside on the software side. ""Let's be patient, let's hope that Logitech is gonna develop new software and everything is gonna be ok..."" No it is not. The whole thing is faulty. The little USB receiver is not powerful enough. I have replaced it with a cheap Chinese USB from eBay which makes it at least 10 times better. I have contacted Logitech to let them know but they already know this. The answer was...""We can send you a wired adaptor to get the USB device closer to you mouse/keyboard"" :) I do not need it. I already have one. It's at 5 cm away and still doesn't work. What a shame....Logitech...is this the beginning of the end?"
3,"Great, But missing one important feature","Setting up was a breeze, Connectivity is awesome, Distance range best I've come across to date. One item lacking is a cap light button. There is no way to check and see if the cap lock is on. This may seem a trivial matter, Normaly you just look at what you've typed, And if its wrong, Backspace and correct. However, When typing passwords, Where you show *** only on the screen, This is a bit of a pain when characters are case sensitive."
4,Very Nice Keyboard,"Great keyboard, nice precision feel to it. Like the separate num. keypad and the bluetooth works great.Cons- Instructions or lack of, had to discover features on my own, also because of no back-light its hard to read lcd."
1,make sure you keep your old mouse and keyboard,Looks beautifull......works about 40% of the time. Be ready to reinstall the software weekly.Very expensive for something that dosent work all the time
1,Beware - junk junk junk,nice looks but software and support (5days - 9 to 5pm and always suggesting to reinstall software x5) should get -5 not 1Requested return and swiching to MS
1,Comes with RIGHT HANDED mouse,"I have an earlier version of the Logitech wireless keyboard, number keypad, and mouse and love it. My earlier version comes with a neutral-handed mouse. This arrived with a right-handed mouse, even though I read the descriptions carefully and NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DOES IT SAY IT COMES WITH A RIGHT-HANDED MOUSE. I was prepared to adapt, however the mouse did not light up with green lights, as it said it would initially. The mouse never charged correctly; I put it in the charger for 2 days and it never took a charge. I was desperate for a working keyboard, so I used a wired mouse with the new keyboard. It was erratic and only worked about half the time I pushed the keys. I returned it."
5,Fantastic Combo but for Windows Only,"Folks,I don't own this combo but really want to get it. I messed around with it at my brother In law's place. Its fantastic. However a note of caution to Mac users, this beautiful product does not work with the Mac. I tried it on my Mac Mini but it could not recognize the hardware. The mouse works fine but keyboard or the number keypad do not."
5,Exciting Holiday Mystery,"After years of cooking for teenagers, friends, and family, Susan Henshaw finally hires a catering company. Known better as ""The Holly and Ms. Ivy"". But when Z Holly, half of the catering team, turns up dead after being strangled by balloons, Susan begins searching for a way to save her party, and find the killer before it's too late.I have to say, this is probably my favorite holiday mystery at the moment. I recommend this to any fans of the books ""We Wish You A Merry Murder"" or ""Misteltoe Murder""."
4,Susan finally hires a caterer and all hell breaks loose,"Susan is feeling run down after a bout with the flu, so she hires the sought after caterers The Holly and Ms Ivy to cater her annual New Year's Eve party. Z ( The Holly of the partnership ) is found dead in the business' van and people get ill and one person dies soon after another party. Worse yet, for some reason Kathleen and Brett are leaving her out of the investigation. Susan is determined to find out what's going wrong all around.This is an excellent holiday mystery. Subplots abound. Great series"
2,"Great Design, Poor Execution","I have owned two of these digital multimeters, because I love the compact design and the easy, protective storage of the electrical leads. With daily use, the first one lasted about a year before the leads stopped working, and the second only lasted a couple of months before the display went on the fritz. It's far better than the junk you can buy at Home Depot or Lowes, but I won't be lured into buying it a third time."
3,"Interesting, but slow-going. Good supplement to Bernal Diaz","This book is a good supplement to Bernal-Diaz's book, ""Conquest of New Spain"". It combines the sparse records of the Aztec point-of-view concerning the conquest. This is a good book for those who wish to know the complete story of the conquest of Mexico."
3,More than a non-scholar would want to know.,If you can plow through this book (or side step the minute details as I did) you will certainly be well informed about this fascinating period in Mexico's history.
1,Irrelevant rubbish,"It does not often happen that a book is rendered useless by a single sentence. This is one of them. Apparently in an attempt to legitimize the hideous cruelty of the inhabitants of old Mexico the author makes the following statement:Every people, it is now generally supposed, has its own right to conduct itself as its national customs provide.This is so incredibly stupid that it makes the author a self-professed idiot and therefore irrelevant. Fortunately it comes early in the book, so that no discerning reader need waste too much time on this garbage."
5,Fascinating,"A wonderful account of one of the most intriguing events in history. Mr. Thomas presents Cortes and Montezuma as real people, of their time in history, without any of the white devil versus noble savage bull. Yes, it is very detailed, with exhaustive references, but very much worth the effort. Educate yourself. Read this book. Thank you."
3,"Interesting, but heavy.","I am not an expert on the history of the times - this book is only my first into learning more. However, I can state the writing is authoritative and appears backed with as much fact as possible. In that regard, Conquest is a worthy read. But...man, the writing is leaden! If a detail can be made more detailed, it's done so at the expense of interest. Frankly, Conquest is written in such a way that it should be narrated by an English professor. Monotone, hold the emotion. (yawn)."
4,game good but needs proper set up,The minigames are interesting and varied; the eye toy set up itself can be frustrating; you have to have very good lighting in order to get the sensor to respond to your movements.
4,Quite good,"This is much better than ""Eye Toy Play"". Overall, the games have much more depth. Eye Toy Play's games were too simple, and I had no motivation to try the harder levels.I've tried all the games except Crazy Taxi and the soccer one. Personally Crazy Taxi doesn't seem all that interesting. My favorites are Nights, Super Monkey Ball, and Samba De Amigo. Many of the games are just plain hard, and your arms will get tired real quick. This can be a good thing depending on whether you want a workout.One complaint: the targets in Space Channel 5 seemed to become unresponsive when the beat got faster, so I'm not even able to complete easy mode. It could be the lighting, but all the other games seem to work."
1,I GOT SENT THE WRONG GAME!,"I ordered this game excited to play it. I bought it along with five other games, and this one came last. unfortunately, they instead sent me ""Eyetoy Play"". And even with this game, the case and the CD were all cracked. I was looking forward to playing Sega Superstars, so I am very dissatisfied."
1,only played it 5 times,the disc stopped working what waste of money that was the saddest part is it wasn't even scratched so its fun for a while then your PS2 is saying it can't read the disc don't believe me email me unijtheg@yahoo.com
4,Wonderful in its simplicity,"I enjoyed reading Ms. Lesser's collection of essays, anecdotes, and vignettes. (Can it really be called an autobiography?) Just when it appears that what the literary world has most to offer us are self-indulgent novels and biographies that think all readers are voyeurs and that life's lessons are learned only through humiliation (usually self-imposed) and and through emotional crises--just then along comes a small book that gives us insights into a person and, at times, into ourselves through wonderful and simply written chapters. This is not a classic--just a well-written book that deserves to be well read."
3,"Economics, even the pros get it wrong...","this book was delivered on time, and the material was easy to use in my class..."
4,"Finally, a book on economics that even I can understand!","This is the book I have been looking for! I sure wish I'd found this book let's say five years ago or maybe $5,000 ago (lol)! Now I'm a big dummie, especially when it comes to economics, but I plan to make millions in the near future by gaining some kind of angle or secret. Mr CR McConnell breaks down all those confusing economic things that have stood between and my dreams of understanding just how money works for years. I recomend this book for anyone that wants to help themselves out economically and plans to help other people out with their money too. Look for me on the cover of Fortune Magazine!"
4,"Good, in fact very good","As an MBA (with a fair subject background)interested in applied economics I found this to be an impressive piece of writing. The real world examples and colloquial expression can only comfort a reader intimidated by this very complex and volumnous discipline. I was rather srprised to see some of the reviews calling this a very difficult-to-comprehend text. In my opinion even someone relatively new to economics will find his knowledge stacking up as he progresses through the text. Given that the sequencing is not classic with micro followed by macro, I feal the authors have done a good job of going against the conventional and merging the potent interrelationships of these two basic areas-after all one evolves into the other. Also the web-based material was also more than helpful. Finally a book in its fifteenth edition, read over 40 odd years better be good."
3,Econ book,"This textbook is very thorough, but at the same time very boring. It is the same edition that we used in our AP Econ class, and I feel that it has everything one has to know for the AP exam, along with all the graphs and charts. The book includes macro and microeconomic concepts. I recommend this textbook if you can stay awake through very dry chapters. I actually enjoy economics, but I learn best through lectures!BTW, the Economics for Dummies book helped me a lot, even though it was a basic supplement to my in-class materials."
5,Solid Text Reinvents Itself,"The subject of Economics as a social science may not be readily grasped by everyone. The blame certainly shouldn't be laid upon this text which is suscinct, informative, and modern. The 15th Edition, written not neccessarily for only the post graduate student, has current examples and flows nicely. Professors may want to change the order of the chapters for ease of teaching style, but that is to be expected. It is an overall winner."
2,Bland,"I love Goth and its sister genre Darkwave and do not get me wrong I do like some of their songs, but the majority sounds so bland an whinny! Hanged man and Monsters make me laugh at how bad they can be. I would not recommend any Crux albums because they are a huge hit or miss. And the lyrics are cheese most of the time. I would save my money if I where you and go buy a better Darkwave album. Check out Cindergarden, now that's real Darkwave."
3,One good song,"Rematered early CXS album. OK, but nothing too exciting. Marilyn My Bitterness is an excellent tune, but ends up being the only decent one on the CD."
1,Terrible!,"This band is so rediculous. they are basicly the goth version of The Backstreet Boys. The music on thois album is hardley satnic...hardley has anything to do with a ""fallen"" angel of any sort. Only the title of the album is good...the music is not."
3,Do-It-Yourself Housebuilding: The Complete Handbook by George Nash,"Do-It-Yourself Housebuilding: The Complete Handbook by George Nash. Mr Nash just about covers all facets of building a house. Saves the reader some footwork, hard knocks and wasted efforts in planning and building a house. This is a good source of information going into the planning stages of building."
3,Do-It Yourself Housebuilding,"This book has alot of good information for the novice builder. It covers almost all aspects of house building. Some of the details are a bit confusing, most of the pictures are dark and hard to see detail, and a few of the, ""see detail xx-xx"", were'nt even to be found. Also, no under slab plumbing was covered."
2,Really bad quality of loose leaves,"I will never try Numi loose leaves again. I bought two kinds of loose leaf from Numi. The quality of Numi loose leaf is the same as leaves from tea bags or even worse. If I want this kind of quality, why would I bother to buy loose leaves."
4,Great unit,This armband is the bomb... I can push the buttons well through the covering and it stays in place. The only reason for the four stars (I would really rate it 4.5) is because when I workout without a tank top the velcro causes irritation on my bare skin.
5,Great Product,"I have had zero problems with this armband and have used it extensively for the past 2 months. Before buying, I had heard that the Creative brand armband is very small and not flexible enough to fit around the upper arm. That is not a problem with this product. I also like how the mp3 player doesn't move around along the length of the armband. Count me very satisfied."
5,Milk for skin,This is my favorite skin product ever! It nourishes and protects unlike any product I have tried. My red prone skin is soothed instantly. I recommended for anyone with sensitive skin!
5,Super Great Deal,This was a steal for a very good fragrance. I tried the sampler and it convinced me to buy the larger set. I like the scent very much and love the design of the bottle.
4,Quirky debut album by the one true All-American band.,"This quirky debut album from the band formerly known as Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids is a great start to any Manson collection. It features samples from various movies (including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang & Charlie and the Chocoloate Factory) and is a true statement on talk-show America and how morals are often worn as badges in America rather than guidelines by which to live your life by. Manson have truly hit a nerve in politics and religion as of late, now you can see what all the fuss is about and where it all started."
5,This is the best manson album ever!!!,"This is the best manson cd ever, smells like children was fantastic, and antichrist svperstar was even better, but this is the best. Cake and sodomy is truly exceptional, along with lunch box, get your gunn and dope hat. If you like manson, get this album, you'll love it!"
5,Appealing anger,"This album is perfect when you're in a bad mood, it helps to relieve that ""fight the world"" mentality we all get sometimes. I loved it!! ""My Monkey"" has long been my favorite track -- truly original. But, don't buy this album without an open mind."
5,IT ROCKS!!!!!!,We need more bands like this. Even Manson has moved away from this style with Animals.
1,"Five + Stars for the album, but...","Don't be ripped off. This exact set (reissue, at that) is available at Hot Topic (happens to be on sale right now for $16.98 - regularly $35) and directly from Marilyn Manson's website, also for $35.Other than that, CUH-LASSIC album!!"
2,A Parents Nightmare Indeed,"It's creepy and spooky, it's relatively cooky...What can I say? The album art is better than the music. Marilyn Manson was SO much better on Mechanical Animals. Check that out."
3,He's Not Getting Any Better!!!,"This is my 8th Marilyn Manson CD, and he's still boring, and dull. Still, my favorites MM CDs are Eat Me, Drink Me, and Lest We Forget! Unless you are a freaky goth kid, and love Marilyn Manson, I probably wouldn't recommend PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY!!!"
5,This cd rocks my socks..,This cd is wild.. Except for the 1st song which is a direct take from WIlly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory :) <Prelude; not cake&sodomy> .. Cakee & Sodomy is an awesome song..so is lunchbox..and snake eyes & sissies..and dogma....and dope hat.. hrm ;) aye..this rocks i like mech an. better tho :I manson live = amazing (...)
3,Just ok,"First of all im a big fan of Marilyn Mnson . After this album most albums are great, but this one is just too average. It has 2 super songs -> cake and sodomy + lunchbox . All the other songs are terrible i cant hear them. This album is just for strict Marilyn Manson fans and i don't recommend to anyone beyond this. If you are new try Mechanical Animals + Antichrist Superstar"
3,Rock roots,"While most of Manson's self-absorbed stabs at edginess subside in proportion to one's years lived, his debut came mildly packed with more honest rock influence than anything the progressively convinced artist produced afterwords, and besides a viable follow-up, is possibly the only recording of merit."
4,Good But The Best Was Yet To Come,"Ah, before the birth of the Antichrist, Mr. Manson dropped the ""Spooky Kids"" name and released ""Portrait"". This album has some pretty good songs on it, but none compare to his later stuff, ""Wrapped in Plastic"", ""Lunch Box"" and ""Dope Hat"" being his three best songs on this record. Like I said, this record is before he came into his best, but it's still a great record from the one who would later become one of the biggest Rock stars ever."
4,Essay on Today's Society Values by Marilyn Manson,"If you think KoRn has something to say, you never really listened to Marilyn Manson's debut. Instead of bashing him for not making another Beautiful People kind of riff, go to your nearest cd store and buy this thing. Manson doesn't hate women, or cops, or children, he simply describes the world as it really is and was when he was a kid. This CD has a really bashing sound to it and the lyrics are like targeting a bullet to light-minded persons. Portrait is just what the title suggests and it's one of the best hard rock albums made in the 90s. While KoRn and other i-just-hate-everything-'cause-it's-fashionable losers are enjoying their ADIDAS and NIKE outfits, Manson attacks for the sake of intelligence."
3,The Debut Of A Modern Metal God,"This is a good solid album for Manson. Not his best work, which I personally believe is Holywood. If you are looking to collect Manson albums this however would be the last one to add to a collection. Has some good songs, but not his best work. If you are a hardcore Mansonite you will love this album, but if not you probably won't. It is just different from his later stuff like Antichrist Superstar or Holywood."
1,Overrated garbage,Dont get me wrong I really liked all of Marilyn's other cds but I thought this one was just plain ridiculous.I have to admit Get Your Gunn is great all the other ones are just filler though.Dont buy this if you like decent music.
2,Horrible first effort..,"I bought the album with high expectations only to be disappointed. Some of the lyrics are thought provoking and creative, while others are just juvenile and stupid. Lousy vocals, below average instrumentally, and all in all just not Manson's best work. 'Cyclops' is one of the few songs I can tolerate, but still isn't enough to save this album from becoming a beverage coster on my livingroom table."
1,"Hmmmm....the elegence, the passion, the art of manson...CRAP","If I melt dry ice, can I swim without getting wet? That is more thought provoking then the entirety of this hate addled piece of trash..instead you should look into Zao, sold here at Amazon."
1,Isn't this idiot's 15 minutes of fame over yet?,Tired cliches and stale lyrics set to a grating electronic noise that claims to be music. Isn't this idiot's 15 minutes of fame over yet?
1,This is Mr. manson...he had a horrible debut,"first i must say, i luv manson and his work, except this album. i dont kno wut reznor found good in this. antichrist superstar and thereafter is what i luv so much about manson. and this is too awfully dark it really gets to repetitive. i heard sumthin bout sum charles manson clip or sumthin in this cd. i dont really reccomend this at all. heck, ur better of with greenday than this 1."
5,Groundbreaking,"This album forever changed the way I look at ""Shock Rock"". I found that Alice Cooper and the shluck ""scare your parents"" metal of the 80's didn't fully have the guts to shred our everyday lives and make us think about who and what we are in society. Manson shook the bible in our faces and showed us how plastic the American day to day life is. ""Cake and Sodomy""...nuff said. It was a first real taste of our real environment.Not everything around us was really important anymore. To close here on my rambling...I've had this CD for four years. A friend of mine said it would never last. I played it just yesterday and my soul melted right back in."
5,This album is what Manson should be striving for now.,"This is a great albm. None of their albums are even close to as good. Smells Like Children was a flop, Superstar was a lot better, but not close, and Mec. Animals is not up to the hype. All the songs are great and actually have a tune. Also, those other guitarists don't come close to the great Daisy Berkowitz"
3,Disappointed,"I was pretty annoyed when my package shipped with no packaging, a broken jewel case, and price tags on the case(Which had no plastic covering). The cd is in ok condition but I ordered this new, not like new or used. There is no reason that should be considered acceptable."
4,"Good, consequenceless fun..","A silly collection of anger, irony, and lethargy that works damn well. It's just a _fun_ album, and is superior to his [their] later works because of this. Lovely music to thrash about to, with standouts being Organ Grinder and Dope Hat. POAAF feels like grunge on a good day."
3,not as good as his others.,"This album contains alot of angst and hatred, which, unfortunently, is one of the few things that propels it along. I think possibly the track with the greatest atmosphere is the family trip. it's cleverly done. However, there definently is something missing here that is found on the brilliant ""Antichrist Superstar"" Best tracks on this are ""The Family Trip"", ""Cake and Sodomy"", and ""Lunchbox"". ""My Monkey"" is pretty funny though. But antichrist before you buy this."
4,TRUE ART,"This cd is a masterpiece, along with every other thing Manson has done. He is a true artist."
3,Not his best Effort,"Don't get me wrong this Album isn't bad, it's essential for any Manson fan, but it's definitely not a Masterpiece as ""AC"" and ""MA"" are. It has a lot of great songs ( ""Lunchbox"" , ""Get your Gunn"", ""Dope Hat"" ) but lacks the constant power of the later Albums. ""My Monkey"" maybe the most twisted song Marylin Manson ever wrote, but it sounds kinda silly. ""Sweet Tooth"" and ""Cyclops"" sound a bit unfinished but they also have their charme. I bought this CD four Months ago and I don't listen to it much anymore, while Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar still rotate once in a week in my Player. It's a good debut but nothing more in comparison to his next two albums."
5,See the world from the dark side.,"In their debut album, Marilyn Manson has produced a sound and lyrical style that has defined what is the standard for the industrial/gothic subculture's music. Manson truly bring out the underdog in each of us. Listining to ""Lunchbox"" one can actually relate to the murderers in Littleton, CO. Marilyn Manson himself is the anti-mainstream, anti-oppression, anti-stupid king of rock and roll. This album scores one for the repressed, black trenchcoat wearing, christian hating, jock killer in all of us. Marilyn Manson For President!"
4,Awesome debut album.,"In my opinion, one of Manson's best albums. It's much different to all of his other albums, and I absolutely love it."
3,A pretty good album but the next 2 are much better.,To say this is a shocking album is somewhat of an understatement.From the sexually disturbing Cake And Sodomy to the self loathing Get Your Gunn to the Charles Manson inspired My Monkey this is pretty serious stuff.I still think Smells Like Children is a much better buy though because the versions of the songs that are on this one are better plus it has 3 really intense cover songs.Still this is pretty cool for a debut.I wouldnt buy it until you have his other ones though.
4,A great first album,"From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload."
4,Great CD,"This is a great album. The beginning half of the album isn't as good as the second, but it's not bad. It is very original, and has great art (Like the claymation cover). A must have for any Manson fan."
5,The First And Best Manson Cd!,When This Album Was Made In 1994 Marilyn Manson Was Young And Reckless Which Gave This Album Has A Very Punkish Like Sound To It And I Love That About It. I Wish The Band Would Have Stayed The Way They Where In This Album! Also This Cd Had Songs From The Old School Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids Band If You Don't Know Any Thing About That Go To This Website [...] It Will Explain Every Thing!Best Songs:1:Cake And Sodomy2:Lunchbox3:Organ Grinder4:Dope Hat5:Get Your Gunn6:My Monkey7:Misery Machine
4,Good Album.,"I have had this album for quite sometime and I used to listen to it a lot. But three years later my musical prefrences have changed quite a bit. I saw it on my cd rack and decided to pop it in to see if I still would like it and I still do. It is very catchy with simple riffs, drum beats and melodies but they are all great. Songs like Dope Hat, Lunchbox and Cake and Sodomy are infectious and I am always happy to replay them. It is a shame that Marilyn Manson isn't like this anymore, the music was FUN although a bit disgusting. The strongest thing about the album is, like I stated before, is the melodies. They are simple but incredibly fun to hum. This band lost that along the way. All in all pick up this album if you want to hear manson before all the media hype."
4,Helpful Hints to Cut Down the Effects of Colds and Flus,"Once I read the book I tried to implement some of the suggestions. We had a definate difference on the number of times that our family was ill, as well as the duration and severity of illness. I recommended it to a nurse at work as a jumping off point for our staff to minimize office spread of illness. Very easy to read, so much so that I quickly read the book several times."
5,CARTRIDGE MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN SOUND QUALITY FOR SERATO or TRAKTOR,"The only defense of this cartridge one can attest to is its resistance to skipping while doing turntable gymnastics. Comments about sound quality of the cartridge while using Serato Scratch or Traktor scratch are irrelevant and can confuse the newcomers. Sound quality of your music depends on the quality of your MP3, sound system, eq and processors. PERIOD!!!! The vinyl for DJ software is just a time code interface. So it makes ZERO difference what type of cartridge you use.Now, if you are using this for REAL 12 inch records or albums then the discussion is warranted and you will notice a big difference between these and some of the others.Just wanted to clear that up!"
5,"Great USB, inexpensive",I bought this USB cable to use with my printer and it works great. A little small in length but a great value for the money.
5,A great case at a very good price.,"I had previously tried an Allora trumpet/flügel wheelie, which I returned (see my separate review on that item). As a replacement, I ordered this item. As soon as I received this item and opened it, I could see right away that it is an excellent product, well-made and perfect for my purposes. I have a standard Bb trumpet and an Olds flügel. They both fit perfectly in the case without any problem. The case also has slots for 4 mouthpieces, which I find very convenient. And there's extra room inside for music or notes, as well as an outside pocket. I still have my mutes in a separate bag. This bag is not a wheelie bag, which means a bit more work to carry it, but it is not overly heavy even with the 2 horns in it. The design is well thought-out with quality construction. If you are looking for a good double bag (and tons of jazz players I know lug around two cases for their trumpet and flügel), this bag is a great choice at a very good price."
5,Great Combo Bag,Space and safety for both instruments and 4 mouthpieces. Space for a little folder of music. Exactly what I need.
3,"Amazing, but...not perfect","These headphones have a few issues. First, there is a characteristic 'dark' sounds from Sennhesier, which I don't prefer. Second these are very power hungry and you good a good strong amp to drive them, not good for computer use without a headphone amp, and the soundstage is odd. You hear the mix hard left, hard right and right up the middle, but the three directions don't come together. At this discounted price, probably best for the money, but not perfect. Oddly sounded best with trance music or singer songwriter music. R&R sounded odd with the vocal lacking in volume."
5,They Are Great !!!!!,"These replaced my Bose AE 2 $150 phones. I paid $499.99 for these and simultaneously bought the NuForce Icon HDP for $429. First off they fit great. I have a large head and was a little worried about that. They make my I-Tunes coming from my H.P Pavilion dv7t Quad Edition laptop sound incredible. In person, they look gorgeous too. Spending $928.99 was a hard choice but what an enjoyable payoff. The NuForce makes an excellent difference from just plugging directly into the headphone jack, night and day actually. I researched forever it seemed but was absolutely worth it. Go for it."
5,"Very musical, highly recommended","After reading a lot of raving reviews about the HD650 my expectations were high. I must say, even without a dedicated headphone amplifier, these cans exceed my expectations!In my opinion they're not extremely analytical, or clinical, just very, very musical. Highly recommended."
5,The Real Deal,"In the price range of $400-500 you won't find many audiophile headphones that top the Sennheiser HD650. You will not regret pulling the trigger on these headphones. However, to get them to really shine you will need a headphone amplifier to drive these cans. My source is a Hifiman HM-601 and it can drive these cans decently well. Combine a good source with these cans along with some 24-bit FLAC files and you'll be in heaven. Also consider using an upgraded cable as well down the road (not cheap though). Lots of reviews out there, I can say the hype is real. It will be a while before I feel the need to upgrade."
5,"""Dynamite Cans""","If you want high quality headphones, look no further. The Sennheiser HD650 Headphones are excellent, I own a pair of Shures EC5 and they are very good but the Sennheiser are a step above, make sure you ""burn"" these phones in for a good 100-200 hours. You will need a powerful receiver or a headphone amplipher. I tried them with my ipod but the ipod could not ""drive"" these phones correctly. I have tried various music (rock,jazz,classical) no matter, you will hear wonderful things in the music that you never heard before. Look around you can get them much cheaper than the $400.00 price tag. I paid $298.00 right here in the marketplace!GET THEM !!"
5,Amazing,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these headphones. I waited about a year from deciding that I was going to buy them, to actually buying them. These are definitely worth every penny, but it's not worth it to stretch your earnings to be able to buy this. It's a luxury item, nothing more.Re-listening to all my music in high-definition is the most fun I've had in a while. Some people might think it's weird, but simply sitting down and listening to music is a very relaxing activity for me now.I paired these with the Fiio e7/e9 combo, and my music sounds ridiculously good. Indescribable."
1,Quality control seems lacking?,"I could never get a sense of how these sound, from dayOne there was slight static, then I realized afterChanging the stock cord, the spring loaded connectorWere bad. Huge disappointment on a $500Headphone. Now, I'm suffering thru sennheiser'sPoor repair process, which makes you ship these phones toCT for repair, instead of listing a local option.I cannot recommend this manufacturer to anyone, andWould never buy a pair of Sennheiser phones again."
3,Not worth the hype - Bass lacking,"I am an audiophile that is willing to spend a fairly hefty amount of money for good quality headphones. These are, in fact, extremely well made and have a tight fit. The issue is that the bass is absolutely lacking. I had to increase the volume on my laptop or iPad to hear it at all. For this price, I can't live with that. They should be relatively perfect. Surprisingly, my husband's Bose noise cancellation headphones sounded night and day better than these did. Bottom line, I returned them. I will update the review once I find a pair that I am completely happy with."
5,Excellent headset providing a realistic flat sound,"This headset is the opposite of a Dr Dree's headset: not to bassy, just the real flat sound your ears deserve. I'm a music composer and producer. I needed a headset for mixing down tracks on my laptop when I'm traveling. This headset was highly recommended by a fellow music composer. I'm glad I bought it."
4,Love These Cans,"I'm no audiophile..lets be clear on this..but these headphones arequite simply the best I've ever owned FOR MUSIC presentation..especiallyclassical and piano..the mids and high end reproductions are superb;I agree with many here that these cans need a break in time and theyalso need (but do not require) a separate headphone amp..they like and needpower to bring out the highs in particular..I don't listen much to works witha lot of bass..these cans don't seem to be designed for bass..also I havefound that the Sennheiser 180's do better with speech (live TV) than the 650's..this just might be my hearing, however..I like many baby-boomers have lost a lot ofmy high-frequency hearing capacity and rely on SOA hearing aids to help mewith the musicOnly negative I have (4 stars instead of 5) is the somewhat short cables thatcame with the 650's..tooshort for most of us that do not want to curl up with our amps..got the Cardascables to go with the 650's...the combo can't be beat"
2,Very Unflat Frequency Response Headphones,It's unbelievable that a company with a great reputation like Sennheiser would release a product as flawed as this one. The lower bass is artificially boosted and the upper freqs are rolled off. If you are a true audiophile and truly know what a great headphone should sound like then stay away from the HD 650s.
5,Wow,"Oh man, by all means if you have the cash do not hesitate picking a pair of these up! However, be aware, to really make these babies sing you need an headphone amplifier. They will work without one; however, the sound is no where near the quality with an amp on the back-end pushing some power into these babies. Also, when you first get these they may not sound completely clean (maybe a bit muffled). Do not be alarmed, after a week or two of good listening time these things really break-in and it's all cream cheese from there - sweetness. Again, if you don't have any issues dropping $400 for these cans plus an amp, go for it...these are the BEST headphones on the market today! Another reviewer said it best...the Germans did it again! Cheers, Sennheiser!"
4,Somewhat advanced,"Hello folks-My level before i bought this book was:1. very familiar with roxio easy movie creation 7.52. somewhat familiar with adobe premier pro 1.5FIRST-I WANT TO EXCLAIM THE WONDERFUL TREATMENT I GOT FROM AMAZON. I PAID $14.00 FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING. IT TOOK 2 DAYS. I EMAILED AMAZON AND THEY REFUNDED THE ENTIRE SHIPPING AT NO CHARGE, AT NO QUESTIONS ASKED. AT NO QUIBBLING. THEY MADE ME FEEL LIKE A PHAROAH! THANK YOU AMAZON.I found the book an excellent deal, but somewhat on the advanced side. I feel the author gave an honest intelligent effort, but id have preferred a little more attention to the basics. I would highly recommend this book to the intermediate (at least) Adobe Premier 1.5 programmer.I WILL ABSOLUTELY ORDER FROM AMAZON AGAIN.And no- this is no schill.rich from Boston."
5,Best Premiere Pro tutorial out there.,"When I got this book, I knew that there would be a lot of invaluable information inside because of the great job the author does in the Total Training DVD series. This book covers everything from keyboard shortcuts and special effects to mattes and green-screening. It even covers what type of microphone to use when doing a voiceover or commentary. It's little details like this that make the book so great. The authors ability to break things down in plain ol' English so that virtually anyone can understand. Plus, the fact that it uses specific genres, like music videos, as source material makes it very helpful to people that are looking for help in particular areas. I definitely think this book is a must have for any Premiere Pro user. Either if they've been using the Premiere platform for six years or six months, they'll find this book worth every penny."
3,Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 Studio Techniques (Studio Techniques),"Three stars for ""user friendly"" and five stars for content. The information is quite detailed but needs a lot of interpretation and rereading to understand. The text doesn't always follow your project and one needs to go to the ""Help"" menu, often. However, if one preservers, the instructions will allow you to use the Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 program to its fullest potential."
3,Pretty good lost 60's group,"I heard The End on the Rubble collection with their song Shades of Orange. That by far was their best song. The songs on here are pretty good, They are not as Psychedelic as Shades of Orange but you liek the songs the more you hear them. Their are three tracks on here (Bromley Common, Linen Draper, and Jacob's Bladder) they are like like 40 second stories of a man and things he does, and they are hilarious. All in all I'd suggest this for a serious Psych fan cuz it's not your everyday Psych group. They have their own unique sound"
4,Fun to Eat,"This product is plainer then the other gronolas but I like to put it on yogurt or with fresh fruit such as bananas. Also, great to put in muffins that I make myself."
4,Yummy!,This granola is so yummy! My daughter is gluten sensitive and we got several of the samples from Bakery on Main at a Gluten free expo. One thing she misses the most is crunchy granola. This satisfied her craving! So good!
4,This is more like coconut heaven granola,"This is certainly not your grandmother's granola. It is sweet, but not too sweet and has a huge bright coconut flavor. It tastes like it's a huge indulgence, but it's not. It's healthy for you. It's a regular snack for me."
3,"Taste is great, but small rock-like fruit pieces ruined it for me","Be VERY careful when eating this cereal. There are tiny dried fruit pieces in the cereal which are so incredibly hard, their consistency is something akin to an uncooked grain of rice. This morning I was eating a bowl, and one of the fruit pieces became lodged between a tooth and my gums while chewing. I unfortunately now have an open, bleeding wound in my mouth thanks to this cereal. So please, be very, very careful while eating this. I never thought I would actually ever have to say that about A BREAKFAST CEREAL!"
5,this is a quality boot,"I have a hard time finding the right heel shape with the right heel height and the right color, leather, etc. I am picky. I like original style and this is it!!! I am not overly fond of the sweater top, but for this price...when I recieved the boots, I was shocked at the quality of the suede, and the craftsmanship of the boot overall. I am ordering another pair for a friend and another style of ""me too"" boot. I am a shop-till-you-drop customer and I don't find much I REALLY like, but this will be a lifetime favorite."
2,be careful with the selection,"This seems like a good window lock on the picture, but it does not work with certain windows frames. I have thin window frames and it did not fit well."
4,Good Start,A nice introduction to the mystic life in today's world for the beginner or a nice review for those more studied.
3,Oh No is Right!,"Great concept and good points made. However, it's very dated and the acting is terrible...terrible, so terrible it's very laughable! It's hard to find educational videos that have quality acting in it. But, if you don't care about the acting (and an annoying off screen nasel voice), the points the video makes about being responsible for homework and studying is right on."
2,"Good band, lousy singer","These guys mix a funk ska rap oy spoken word scuffle rock with a lot of four letter words and despite being solid in terms of composition and writing, this is something you are either going to like or hate, and I don't need to tell you what I feel about it. The pity is that in many places they show they have what it takes to be far more interesting. ""Push the Ghosts"" could be a nice rock anthem with a little work on the chorus, but the singer (not really, he just talks fast for the most part) intrudes way to much and wrecks it. ""Got me Sussed"" could work as well, with a little discipline in the writing, but again the lead singer so dominates everything that you can't focus on the good parts of their sound. I see no hope, unless some other members of the band involved in the songwriting move on and do better. Or they dump Phil."
3,Book,"The condition of the book was listed as ""good."" I do not agree because many pages were underlined in pen. Had I known about the underlining I would not have purchased the item. I could have paid less for other books listed in fair condition. I believe that the seller should have been more specific."
5,It deserves twenty stars!,"If you start reading this, expect to finish itin one go! It will grab your attention, from Hatch and Lindsey's car accident and his journey to Hell and back to the amusement park climax. It will put you in the twisted mind of a psycho killer and also in the mind of a man falling apart with his vision's of the killer's evil doings. It is truly terrifying and a thousand times better than the movie version(which boasted a great gothic/industrial metal musical soundtrack). READ THIS NOW! The best of Koontz!"
2,Everyone's a critic....,"I've had HIDEAWAY sitting around the house for years. It's been on my stack of ""eventual reads"" and decided to get it out of the way (as in reading so it could be put). I haven't read anything by Mr. Koontz in ages...and ages. I got exactly half way through and realized that, although I had no difficulty turning pages, his style of writing was completely lacking in soul. Has his writing always been stilted? And he is WAY TOO wordy! Now don't get me wrong, Mr. K must be doing something right. His efforts have afforded him what is, undoubtedly, an ultra comfortable living and lifestyle. At one time, early in my reading career, I rather enjoyed him. But I can't recommend this one."
2,The Movie Was Better,"This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better... much better. I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all. The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting."
1,horrible,"This is by far one of his worst books. The movie was much better than the book. Twilight Eyes was one of his best books. Hideaway the movie explores the intensity of the situation better than the book. The movie scared me, the book did not"
2,"Maybe worth reading, if you're a hardcore Koontz fan","Definitely not his best work, but it was pretty gruesome if you're into that kind of thing. If you really, really like Dean Koontz, you might give it a try. It has a couple of interesting ideas."
4,One of his best,"This was an absorbing story, with some ironic twists and one of his best evil antagonists."
2,"Rather, you should hide, away from this book.","Long on suspense, short on satisfaction, this book was rank, unfrightening, and more Ren-and-Stimpy shock horror than fulfilling. He tries to ask some philisophical questions which aren't very well dealt with. One of the reviews in the inside cover says he tackles themes worthy of C S Lewis. Well, maybe he tackles them, but then he gets scared and runs away from them with his tail between his legs"
2,A Painful Slog toward an Ugly Destination,"Very difficult book for me to get through, then an ending that made me wish I didn't bother. I could hardly keep my eyes opened through Koontz's drawn-out medical ""drama"" and his melodramatic evil characterizations. I simply found the book boring, but decided to stick it out. It did not scare me; it did not make me laugh; it did not satisfy me in the end. Life is too short for this type of over-written and under-plotted and under-characterized work. I couldn't bear to give the book only one star, because it was obvious Koontz was trying really, really hard to make a literate and informative book. But I never gave a damn about the phony characters--from peter perfect resuscitation patient to the doctor that just loved his darn patients too much to the evil man in sunglasses that lived in the realm between life and death, I couldn't buy it. It felt contrived, like most of the books from Koontz."
5,Don't Miss this One,"I have just recently started reading Koontz novels. I am hooked! I am not one to write long reviews, so just let me say this is a must read. You are hooked from the first page and it is a thrill ride all the way. I loved the ending. If you are a fan of suspense and horror don't miss this one! Dean Koontz at his best. Enjoy!"
4,Twisted,"It kind of makes you wonder what goes on in the heads of those who write things like this. Read Hideaway and you will find out. This has to be the second most twisted, evil book I have read (yet), second only to False Memory. The character descriptions are so descriptive that I found my eyes hiding from the sunlight after reading about Vassago. Read it and find out why. I think that if someone were a little impressionable (and evil) after reading it, they might just have a few macabre whims. Stranger things have happened. Of course we all know there is evil lurking around, but do yourself a favor and read this book, then put yourself in any one of the number of victims shoes and be thankful that these twisted, horrible things only happen few and far between in our ""real world."" (At least I HOPE this is somewhat true.)"
4,New Dean Koontz fan!!!,This was the first Dean Koontz novel that I have read. I was very impressed by the writing style and gripping story. I can't wait to read more of his work.
4,Interesting plot,This is about a man who goes to the brink of death but comes back only to discover that he brought something sinister with him. Very dark and atmospheric and very suspenseful.
4,Dean Koontz is excellent at his craft,I've read hundreds of popular fiction novels and everything Koontz has published.. but there is a scene in this book where I was so eager to continue reading to see what happened next that my heart started pounding in my chest and I had all the classic symptons of fright. And I had this reaction simply from the printed word...it was the only time that has ever happened to me. Koontz is also the only author that commanded my attention so completely that I went to the bookstore bought everything by him and read them all one by one all in a row. That was a fun two weeks!
4,"Book: Yes, Movie: No",I luckily listen to the book on tape before seeing the dreadful movie. This is a terribly funny book inbetween some really scary moments. The end is a bit much but overall it's delightful. The movie is in no way like the story (Think King's Deloris Claiborne). Enjoyable.
5,UTTER BRILLIANCE!,"This is one of my favourite books of all time, standing with Michael Moorcock's Elric books, Pardon Me! You're Stepping On My Eyeball by Paul Zindel and Koontz's Voice Of The Night. I love a good religious thriller. As with all Koontz books, the main goodies are boring and the other characters and especially the baddies are brilliantly done."
4,Slow building but reaches an intense climax,"This Koontz thriller progressed slower than some of his other page-turners. It built a solid foundation on its 4 main characters, one of which represents the most evil of natures. The two protagonists, a husband and wife develop and endear themselves to the reader as they seek to understand and then vanquish the evil presence that has attached itself to their lives following the husband's deadly experience. The climax of this book makes it a suspenseful, worthwhile read."
5,Excellent !!! Thrilling !!! Intense !!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It's an easy read as are most of Koontz's novels are and is exciting throughout. Definately, one of his best!"
2,"Had promise, but ending was awful!","This book had some promising ideas, and in the hands of someone else (me or Stephen King) could have been excellent. It was far more shallow than it could and should have been. When I was at school, I would write long stories, and finish them abruptly when told I had half an hour. This must have happened here. Koontz was bored, and finished off quickly, while reading something better."
3,"It is good, but the end could be better!!","It keeps you reading, but it gives you too many details. The end is not what I expected, it could be better."
3,I guess I'm not a Koontz fan,"As I love to read horror, especially the popular authors such as King, Cornwell, Straub, and Mccammon, imagine my surprize to be so disappointed in such a bestselling author! It wasn't a bad story, but I thought his writing style disinteresting. I loved his villian though, so I might read more of his stuff, if it's in the bargain bin."
4,Hideaway,"I love Dean Koontz' Odd Thomas Series, so I went out and bought a truck load of Koontz books, and Hideaway was one of them; it's disturbing in so many ways, but I couldn't put it down, so I guess that makes me ""disturbed."""
2,Nothing ever happened,"I was expecting something cool to happen but it never did. The book has an amazing first few pages, then starts talking about one topic for like a million pages & it gets old. ""Funhouse"" by Dean Koontz is actually a better book if that says anything."
3,Good plot once again falls apart,"Dean Koontz has a nack for coming up with some good plots. But inevitably, they fall apart due to his usual monotonous delivery and not planning in advance. He comes up with a fascinating subject, but doesn't think about how the main character will survive(he\she almost always does.) The story, while scary in some parts, slowly dissolves into exactly what you expect to happen."
2,Waste of time.,"This book was my first Dean Koontz experience and I found myself unfulfilled and confused as to why people rave of his writing. Certainly to read a book as predictable and almost boring as this constitutes a considerable waste of ""quality book reading"" time. He overshadows this work with religion without even attempting to use fundemental Christian beliefs which only makes you blurt out a sincere ""Huh?"" when you finally reach the end. I have to honsestly say I did not like any of the characters or feel I was brought into the book to feel a part of it. Perhaps someday I will try another Koontz book. But if this work is any indication, I might as well read tabloids, perhaps they can spark a less predictable ending!"
2,"Nice idea, flawed execution","We bought two of these to monitor the kids while sleeping.One was dead on arrival, and, after a lengthy call with Motorola support, was exchanged.The other lasted six months before suffering the same fate -- you can connect once, but subsequent connections are refused until the camera is disconnected and the battery removed and replaced.There also seems to be a bug -- sometimes when we connect, the camera emits noises, even though the phone is monitoring, and not sending, audio. We wondered why our younger one was waking up a few minutes after we turned the camera on, until one of us was in the room when it happened.This particularly phone system is ingenious in conception, but all of the different units have serious bugs of some sort. Moto should have done more testing before releasing it."
3,The future of the Internet,"I've always been a big fan of Cyberpunk and the progression of technology. This book doesn't disappoint in that regard. Following the adventures of a computer hacker given blistering hacking tech and his search for his lost memories and who he is it all comes to an end in China.While this book is a nice change of pace in the SCI-FI world of Cyberpunk it left me wanting just a bit more. It wasn't that it's a bad book, it's just there are times I wish paragraphs and pages were tightened up a bit so that the action maintained at a steady pace. There are a few places where I got pulled out of the chapter and I never quiet regained my flow.I would still recommend reading this though. I look forward to reading more by this author. I feel his work will continue to improve and he might become a great in the SCI-FI field."
1,"Obsolete!! This book is for a very old system, release 3.",What version of SAP are all theses people using? Most production systems are using 4.6c or higher. This book is for 3.0. Almost all the screens and menu paths have changed. This was a good book in it's day. But that day has long past. This book must be updated to version 6.20. Can someone suggest a current FI/CO book?
4,Easy FI CO discovery,"I found it very explicit, and I am a french guy discovering SAP english lingo. It shows you all the important areas to be mastered by a SAP consultant / key user, all the main features of the software. They created a learning process through the book which I found very helpful for some matters which were a little bit old for me (e.g. CO).Drawbacks : 3.1h screens (hey! it was published in 2000!), asset accouting is missing, the price... but the book looks good in your bookshelves :)In conclusion: with this book + the SAP online help + F1 anyone could understand the FICO customizing."
5,Paid for itself within 1/2 hour of use,"Best book written on cofig. in FI/CO. Worth twice the sticker price. It is an execlent source on how to cofigure in FI/CO. All SAP user levels will appreciate this book. It is clearly written (unlike the R/3 Lib) with good step-by-step examples. We (2 business analysts and one programmer) spent 3 days attempting to solve a particular problem. Once we received this book, we resolved it in 1/2 hour!! I hope to see something like this for the other modules."
5,Outstanding,"For perhaps the first time, a detailed exposition of the byzantine world of SAP's FI/CO configuration aspects. It is written in clear, easy-to-understand English, a distinct difference from SAP's own documentation. I only wish the book had been published much earlier: would have saved a lot of sleepless nights....This book is a must-have for the SAP FI/CO professional."
2,Great if you don't want to know about Fixed Assets,"This book covers all FI/CO modules thoroughly except Fixed Assets which is not covered at all. The authors of the book themselves considered it ""beyond the scope of this book"" so if you need FA configuration details you will have to look elsewhere."
2,Old version,It's on SAP 4.6 version. Everyone now a days use ECC6. There are few big different. Good for building base idea. But not very recommendable for professional for working professional.
2,Not really that good,"I am a SAP R/3 FICO consultant for 8 years now. I know my way around. The book only describes most basic customization, to get an R/3 system up and running the ""standard"" way. For advanced customization, tricking the system, there's no room. No bigger concepts, no 10 ways of doing things, or anything else either. No special things like AA, SL, LC, PC, ABC, etc. Very, very, very basic stuff. And: they don't even reply when you send them an email. Would be nice for 20 USD, but not worth the money."
3,"Good resource book for ""How To"" configure SAP","This is a good book and might well deserve a 4 start rating. The pluses are it covers a large range of ""How To"" tasks necessary for setting up and maintaining your SAP system in as clear a presentation as is possible for the monolith that is SAP. Menu paths and transaction codes are listed and the information is well organized. Its minuses are that the information is out of date so it's difficult to follow the menu paths and some of the T codes don't work any longer. Sometimes the directions are not as specific or detailed as I would like. I would prefer directions that are crystal clear (do this to accomplish X) but I'm afraid that has more to do with the SAP labyrinth than the author. Only 3 starts because of the out-of-date info and lack of detail but still a good starting point to figure things out."
5,The best book to read on FICO module!!!!,There isn't very many FICO books out there that explains CO configuration. This book explains everything and the step-by-step configuration in CO. The authors did a good job in explaining the FICO module. Anybody who is new at configuring FICO should buy this book and would surely feel that they are well-equipped at handling their job. Looking forward to the updated version of this book!!!!!!
4,Whoa. This is weird but I dig it.,"My 1st Primus CD, and wasn't sure what to expect. It is quite strange, but catchy and groovy as well. Les Claypool is quite a bass player, albeit almost a bit sloppy at times (which doesn't bother me as much as it does some), the entire band is frighteningly tight and in synch with each other. Worth a listen if you've not heard Primus."
5,as intelligent as it is bizarre,"les claypool and crew manage to make damn weird yet entertaining music, and at the samae time make it socially aware. Example: The illusion and reality of 'American Life,' and the pro-union lyrics of 'Those Damn Blue-collared Tweekers.' Brilliant musicianship from all participants."
1,Let Down part one!,"This was a huge let down out of the 13 songs 2 are good. And the songs that are good really arint that good in the first place! 'Here Comes The Bastards' and 'Jerry Was A Race Car Driver' are the only good songs. This is a really really really bad record, Les Claypool should be banned from ever singing. The guitar work isnt bad, and thr Drumming is all right. The only really good thing about this bad is Les Claypools bass playing I mean I can name maybe two or three better bass players and that is it! But no matter how good he plays the bass it would never make up for how bad this record is!!! Dont Waste your money, I mean you would have really really high to get into this, and you still wouldnt think it was good you would think it was funny."
1,Change the title!,"Should be named ""Cut the Cheese"", because if the offense to my ears could be converted to odor that's what it would smell like to my nose. I'm not the biggest Primus fan, but I expected more than this drivel."
4,great early primus,"this album was an introduction to many people for primus (myself included) and i've been a fan ever since i first heard ""blue collar tweekers."" les is an absolutely amazing bassist and this small but talented group works great together. with a mix of oddish funny lyrical content and meaninful social commentaires, primus is great for anyone looking for something a little different, something that you'll actually have to think about."
5,who are these guys?,"sure, you know ""wynonnas big brown beaver"" and ""my name is mud,"" but who are these guys that wrote this weird music? theyre primus and theyre some of the most talented musicians in modern rock. this album is an astounding piece of work that really shows just who primus are, which is something you cant really classify. fans of metal to funk have enjoyed primus, which is where they set themselves apart -- being able to appeal to different tastes. whether you are a musician in search of great technical ability or just someone who wants a few catchy tunes, pick up this album and see what it does for you."
3,Mixed Dice,"There are some definite hits and misses with this album. The hits are generally the ones you'll hear on the radio (Jerry, Tommy, Sgt. Baker, Blue Collar) along with Here Come the Bastards and my personal favorite: Grandpa's Little Ditty! However, the rest of the album does not captivate my interest at all. There's enough good on this album to make it worth buying if you're quick with the skip button on your player."
3,Primus's first flop?,"While I thought this album definately had its moments, I just couldn't get into most of the songs on the CD. With the exception of such classics as Tommy the Cat and Jerry was a Racecar Driver, I thought most of the songs were written at a lower caliber than that of the CD's predecessors, Suck on This and Frizzle Fry. I think that after Frizzle Fry (my fav Primus album), Primus fans were craving another CD asap, and the boys took a little less time on this one. Overall, I'd say that this CD was good, but somewhat of a let-down after Primus's first two incredible albums."
3,"Great album, not so good sound on vinyl edition","This is my first Primus album and i really enjoyed it, all great songs with a sound that reseblmes King Crimson tough wih their own particular style. But i'm a bit disappointed with the vinyl edition because it doesn't sound loud enough and equalization is not the best. I hope we get a remastered edition some day."
4,"So this is Primus, I likus","I've liked Primus for a long time but for whatever reason I never got one of their albums. So I asked a friend and this is the one he recommended. And what a good choice. There are some classics I've heard before and some new ones I wish I had. Primus is not for everyone but if you like to wonder off the beaten path I would recommend it. Select Tracks: ""Jerry was a Racecar Driver"", ""American Life"", ""Tommy the Cat"", ""Fish On""."
5,Best Primus Album,"The title of my review says it all. This is my favorite Primus album. Even Frizzle Fry in my opinion is a distant second. The best part of this is the songs. Primus was at the height of their creativity and songwriting and humor on this one. The quirky songs and lyrics still feel fresh, and its really a fun album to listen to. All the songs are good and SSC should be listened to all the way through if possible, but my personal favorites are:""Here Come the Bastards""""Sgt. Baker""""American Life""""Is it Luck?""""Tommy the Cat""""Those Damned Blue Collar Tweakers""""Fish On""If you can only buy two Primus albums, make them Sailing on Seas of Cheese and Frizzle Fry. If you can only own one, make it this one. Of course if you're more a fan of the standard 3 minute top 40 rock song like something from Nickleback, Avril Levine or (gulp) Creed, then you'll probably not know what to do with this."
4,SWEET CHEESE,"THIS EARLY 90`S PRIMUS IS GREAT,PRIMUS IS PRIMUS IS PRIMUS,YOU KNOW YOUR GOING TO GET SOME GOOD FUNKY ROCK WHEN YOU BUY A PRIMUS CD,I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THIS KINDA CHILLI PEPPERISH BUT HEAVIER AND BETTER AND MORE DIVERSE WITH MORE SKILL ON THE INSTUMENTS,THE MUSICIANSHIP ON ALL PRIMUS DISCS IS SUPERB AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT.GET YOUR CHEESE!"
2,Not as good as pepperjack,I thought this was supposed to be software that had cheese recipes in it. Instead I get a lot of Bass and some guy talking through his nose. I finally was able to make some but it did not taste that good so I am going to return this because it no workie workie.
3,Second Weakest Album,"The weakest Primus album is undoubtedly 'Tales from the Punchbowl', which even the members of Primus admit. However, this album rates a close second. Some of the songs are fairly good, but they all lack the flair displayed in albums such as 'Pork Soda' and 'Suck on This'. Even the song 'Those Damn Blue Collar Tweakers', which is one of their best when played live, sounds dull and washed out on this recording.In fact, the entire album has a washed out feel to it, as if it were recorded in a tin shed with only a petrol generator to power their equipment.Primus are my second favourite band (next to Nine Inch Nails - a strange combination, I know), but when I heard this album, I was nearly turned off them forever. Luckily, I took a listen to 'Suck On This' and became an instant fan.So, if you don't like this album, try one of the others. Bear in mind, though, that Primus can be an acquired taste. Listen a few times before making up your mind."
1,Horrible,"This book is poorly organized and people would be better off purchasing the Chicage Manual of Style, English Grammar for Dummies or other reference book. Also, I have had the misfortune of speaking to the grammar lady, and found her to be rude, discourteous and not at all interested in helping others with grammar issues. As a professional writer, I would definitely say ""Pass!"""
4,A sentimental favorite of mine,"I pulled this one out because I'd been thinking of it for a friend of mine who's working on becoming an environmental lawyer: environmental-legal-science fiction. I'll have to keep an eye out for a copy for her. It's also a sentimental favorite of mine: a self-educated man teaches the natives of a paradisical planet how to defend themselves against the inevitable developers, and they succeed following his Plan. Look forward to the moment when the lawyer for the natives turns the tables on his opponent in one breathtaking, delightful twist.Not quite as good as I remembered it being, but entertaining nonetheless."
5,The twins loved it!,"We bought this book for our slightly-more-than-2-year-old twin grandsons, and they loved it. At this age, they're more interested in identifying the pictures than following the story, but that's ok. There's something about the monkey image that is endlessly fascinating to them. All two-year-olds love monkeys. Go for it!"
2,"Monkeys have emotions, too (but better options exist for you)","Out of a dozen ""feelings"" in the book, almost half are negative (scared, hurt, sick, sad, naughty), plus the presumption that your youngster needs to sulk in time outs.This very short board book, published in 1998, simply takes scenes from existing Curious George books. This then is a money grab, and offers little at that.For a child who has trouble handling emotions, better options exist. For the baby demographic,Disney's Winnie the Pooh: Feelings (Learn & Grow)is a great choice. Older kids can try eitherToday I Feel Silly: And Other Moods That Make My Dayby Jamie Lee Curtis orBig Rabbit's Bad Moodby Romanian author (not the model?) Ramona Badescu."
2,A disappointment,"I am very interested in the Fragments affair and was eager to read this new account of it. Unfortunately I found this book disappointing. It adds little new to the other published works, notably historian Stefan Maechler's excellent account which was published in English last year. While Eskin has a good style, his narrative is jumbled, he skips around a lot and it is often hard to work out what is going on. Also Eskin virtually ruins his own book by going on endlessly about himself when it is really not relevant to Wilkomirski's story. There are too many unnecessary uses of the words I, me, and myself by Eskin to make this a focussed study of the Fragments affair."
3,slow delivery,"Received product in good condition, but delivery took longer than anticipated. Emailed the shipper to find out where product was; no reply, but the book arrived the following day."
1,Terrible,"This DVD is a joke. It's so dark that most of the time you can't really see the dancers. In ""Le Petit Pan"", you see vague shapes moving around, nothing more, then at the end the face of a man eating. In others some people in tights are stretching and walking around. It picks up a little in the last ballet ""The White Swan"" of Swan Lake; unfortunately the cameraman who must be as bored as I am focuses on the gloomy and tormented faces of the dancers and stays there.The only good part is the two minutes bonus of the Black Swan of Swan Lake."
2,"The dancers are great. The coreographer, well...","I had never heard of Mr Norbert Schmucki before I watched this video. He signs 5 out of the 7 pieces here, making such a waste of one the best ballet ensemble in the world. It ranges from the ridiculous Escamillo, sort of a parody of ""Don Quixote"", to an infamous pas-de-deux ""Une Femme"". The Paris Opera Ballet could have well spared our time and patient with such a display of amateur coreography: Mr Schmucki manages to use all the modern dance cliches, all the time, in every work! Silvie Guillem and Manuel Legris in ""Grand Pas Classique"" are fantastic, the only reason I'm giving this video 2 stars. Noella Pontois presents a disappointing White Swan, the least one would expect from such a star."
3,Sylvie Guillem was GREAT. She's the only reason I bought it,17January1999 0950 Sylvie Guillem was GREAT. The only problem is there wasn't enough of her in performance. She's the only reason I purchased this video.
1,A Must To Avoid,"This DVD was totally unwatchable. I was excited when I saw that Escamelo was one of the ballets. But when it came on all I could see was a red cape waving around and sometimes a hint of flesh tones.V.I.E.W. DVD's have a tendancy to be dark, but one would think that they'd try harder to clean then up better. I must admit that Paris Opera Ballet - Six Ballets is great, but it too is too dark. But you can see what's going on."
3,A bit dated,"I ordered this book recently and quickly saw that it is really dated information. If you have never, ever, in your life, thought about publishing, maybe it would be alright. But now you can learn more timely information on the web or by getting a new edition of Writer's Market, that is packed with even more info and is kept up to date with a subscription service on-line."
3,a real (but cheap) violin at a very cheap price,"Really you don't expect much for 49$, but this is a real violin with case and bow that really plays. It wasn't ""ready to play"" when I received it. The violin comes unstrung (but strings included). I had to redrill the holes for the tuning pegs and place the bridge (also included). So, if you are a parent unfamiliar with violins, I couldn't recommend it unless you have a friend to help you put it all together. But to get a new working violin for this price would otherwise be hard to duplicate."
2,IT was free,It was free and I got it to test my Ipad. Tried to read it and couldn't get past chapter one. It is very academic and it would be helpful to a music major trying to reference a topic. It very dry and it was written over 100 years ago (1891).
2,Opaque,"This book, just over 100 pages long, is short on theory and focuses instead on the practical aspects of celestial navigation. There is nothing wrong with this approach. Unfortunately, the introduction of concepts without any explanation of their importance, or how they fit together, leaves the reader with little more than a list of steps to go through to calculate a position, and no clear understanding of when to apply which corrections or why. Explanations are given short shrift, and the reader is left muddled about what he or she is actually doing with all of the additions and subtractions. There are better choices out there for an introductory book on celestial navigation."
5,Best one yet....,"Cattle Decap is a great band to see live, and I have done so several times. That said, I really believe the guys are kinda like post modern artsy types at heart, which is a little amusing. I wouldn't be surprised if their next cd comes out as an experimental electronic music blend of grind core and background noise :-)Travis is an amazing vocalist. Meeting him you would never guess that he was capable of producing vocals like he does. You have to hear him to believe it, as he does just as well live as he does on this disk where he often double-tracks his voice.Make no mistake about it, these are some serious musicians. Josh's guitar playing continues to evolve, as does Troy's bass playing. I can never keep track of who their current drummer is.... :-)This cd is their strongest yet, although Humanure was also great."
5,"Good overview,","This book is a very helpful collection of top names in literary theory. When you finish reading the essays, you actually have a sense of what literary theory is."
4,Enjoyable,"Batman is always enjoyable to watch, and the plot had a good twist to it.I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
4,"Either You're Already Gonna Buy It, Or You're Not...","...what I mean is, if you're reading this review, you're probably already a 'Beyond fan, and already have other stuff, and are likely just considering whether or not to get this to complete your collection - if you enjoy the show, this thing has everything that made the show a hit, and more, period(& YES -as the cover states- this IS the Original/Uncut Version)."
3,IT'S TRUE! THE UNEDITED VERSION IS THE BEST!,"i was like others thinking that the edits they would make would not disrupt the film. i have seen the unedited version and it is one of the best batman films made, live action or cartoon. then i saw the edited version. they have changed key scenes in the movie. the mail one is the jokers fate. they took out a scene where some one shoots the joker with a gun. other scene replacements are stupid. at one point in the original version the joke says the word ""putz"" ans they replace it with ""yutz"". WHY!? is putz a bad word in yiddish or something!? this version is good for 2 1/2 stars and fun to watch. ther original version is a masterpiece and should be released with a warning label. SEE THE UNEDITED VERSION FOR A FINE MATURE FILM."
2,connection sucks,"Good movie, but the instant video fails to connect more often than not. The system lacks polish, could be fine-tuned, probably."
1,Disappointing release,"I just picked this up today. It's a two-disc set that includes a blu-ray version and a dvd version. The most disappointing feature of this release is that the blu-ray is in full-frame aspect ratio. No widescreen! Considering there was a widescreen dvd release years ago, I find it very disappointing that this release takes a step backward."
2,Not for little kids,"My kids like it, but thank goodness they're too young to understand parts of the plot. An insane asylum, with pschosurgery and torture... not want you want your little ones watching!"
3,Five Stars If We Get the Uncensored Original Release Edit,"Yes, be warned. It seems that Gore/Lieberman have struck fear into the hearts of WB. ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"" has been delayed from Oct. to Dec., so WB can TRIM, CUT, SNIP OUT, EDIT--in other words, CENSOR everything that gives offense to our self-appointed moral guardians (see above). This is no rumor, but fact. So be warned. I would love to own this movie, but if WB censors the expression of the film's creators, I'll simply rent it.One last word, the above rant refers to the cutting-edge and sometimes brutually violent nature of the film. It's no kiddie flick and should not be marketed to kids. Remember, though, that WB saw the screenplay; they gave the go-ahead and green light to Paul Dini and company. So if you don't want your politicians telling you what you can watch, remember to vote. (I'm no Republican, but Tipper ""Mrs. Censorship"" Gore gives me serious chills....)"
4,flawed perfection,"All right, so we can thank our friends in Washington and some of the heads at WB for this kiddie-friendly version of what could have been an animated classic (for those of us who can look beyond Mickey and friends). With that in mind, this is still a great film. The edits took away from the emotional impact and intense drama of the story, but there's still something there. The film is quick in getting to the action and the plot moves along at a brisk pace. For Batman fans and comic book fans in general, Batman Beyond:Return of the Joker delivers big time action and finally makes us care about Bruce Wayne's heir to the batcave. After watching the feature and some of the extras, I'm hoping that WB decides to release some more of the episodes of any of the 3 Dini/Timm DC series on DVD. If that's too much to hope for, at least WB has gotten me pumped for the upcoming Batman Beyond live action movie."
2,Censorship Jerks,"The undedited version of this movie was wonderful, incredible, spectacular even! Unfortunately, that version does not show up on this DVD! Instead the public is fed a watered down, gutted version that tears all the soul out of a true masterpiece. The censors and executives at Warner Brothers have ruined what once was a fine movie. Don't buy this DVD until Warner Brothers releases an edition that hasn't been reduced to kiddie-...!"
1,"incredible uncut, mediocre and insulting in this version","Some people may argue that it was justifiable to edit down the original version of this movie in order to release it for children. Those people are wrong, and there's no way they could say that if they'd seen the uncut version. The parts which were edited out are incredibly crucial to the plot of the movie, and delve beautifully into Batman as a character and the Joker as the most insane and maniacal villain of them all.If WB ever releases the real version of this movie, buy that. Until they do, don't bother."
1,PARENTS BEWARE - This DVD shows depraved child abuse,"Remember when Batman cartoons were FUN?Parents should know that this twisted ""cartoon"" shows multiple murders and the disturbing physical and psychological torture of a child character.The producers of this series should be ashamed. They have tainted a great set of characters with this repugnant story. What in the world were all the business and creative people who worked on this project thinking?Creators Dini and Timm and company used to have a fresh outlook on Batman and ""family"". Now they are so creatively bankrupt, so lacking of real-world perspective, that they have nothing to offer in the way of new stories. So they resort to killing and torturing the characters, and call themselves ""daring"". The creators should get out of Hollywood for a couple of years. Try to remember the reason you wanted to make cartoons.Kids should not watch this disturbing movie and parents should not buy it."
1,"A slap in the face to ""Batman""","This cheaply-animated garbage is a cruel mockery of the beloved Batman we all grew up with.The backbrounds are cheaply animated,the characters are overly violent and overly dramatic nad there's no plot whatsover.This is definately not a children's show,and I doubt adults will be able to sit still through this disturbing cartoon.The whole""Batman Beyond"" setries is a very disturbing cartoons-not even a psycho would be able to enjoy this series.If you want a GOOD Batman show,go with ""Batman & Robin"" or the original 60s Batman TV series."
3,Good Movie 3 1/2,"This New Batman Movie from the Batman Beyond series was enjoyable to watch. I didn't see the edited version of the movie on WB's Network, from what I hear I'm glad. I have to admit though that this is more a mature late teen-ager movie.Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil has always been good voices for the series and they do justice to their characters. Overall this is a good movie and would watch it again."
2,Wrong Version,"Well, considering that I had to send the item back. This wasn't a good purchase. The item was advertised as the uncut version of the movie and I was sent the cut version. This was taken care of satisfactorially which was good but the fact that it was misrepresented in the first place was bad. I did receive my money back and a small goodwill credit which did reimburse me for mailing the movie back. Still it was a hassle and I didn't get what I wanted."
3,Movie?,"I was a bit disappointed. Being a movie I expected a little more from it. It just seemed like a longer TV episode, just a touch edgier. I do like the move, and the TV show. I think this batman spin-off is as good as the old batman cartoon in its own way, and I am a bit disappointed that it did not last longer. It had much better writing than the new batman series the WB is running now (The Batman). I would suggest anyone who liked the TV series check the move out but don't expect more just because it is a movie."
4,Watch out for spoilers!,"If you get the DVD version, DO NOT watch the ""animated character bios"" until after you have watched the movie. They contain at least one spoiler which I wish I hadn't seen until afterwards. As for the movie itself, I definitely agree that it's the best animated Batman movie yet. There were some weaknesses in the story and cinematography, but it is something that will stick with me. It goes farther in some respects than the Saturday morning cartoon, but it does so without losing the spirit of where it came from."
4,A throwback to batman the animated series.,"This movie was way more than I expected. This movie is certainly not r-rated, but is uncut from the HBO version. So not really hardcore, but it is telling the truth that it is unrated. The movie itself is a cross between Bat. Beyond and the origianl animated series. Some of the animation is REALLY good for this non-theatrical release. Though it could not pass for a big screen movie, still very enjoyable for you people who like good cartoons."
2,Too Bad WB Didn't Have the Guts to Release the Real One,"Let me say right now, I've seen both versions of this movie, and the original uncut one is probably 4.5-5 stars IMO. Unforutunately, by making the cuts they did, they ruined both the dramatic tension in the story and the coherency of the story itself. The movie makes very little sense with the major change they made, and I for one am glad I only rented the movie instead of purchasing it. The screener I saw a couple months ago was a far better movie. What's up with that, WB? You guys will get my money when I can get the awesome movie I saw two months ago.For all you parents out there, this movie is moderately kid-friendly now, but it's still kind of creepy and in all likelihood will be enjoyed as much by your child as Batman: Sub-Zero. Take that as you will. For all adults out there looking to add this to their collection, don't bother. You'd get more entertainment out of watching a couple episodes of the show."
5,What DC should aspire to,"Movies of this caliber are what DC should be producing instead of Superman:Doomsday and Gotham Knights. Great story, great characters.Batman Beyond was already a great achievement in providing an entertaining continuation of the Batman: TAS mythos, but this movie takes it to the next level. The characters are interesting, there is legitimate conflict and the psychological attack by the Joker elevates him from his evil clown status.Definitely worth multiple watches and actually motivated me to buy Gotham Knights when Batman Beyond: The Movie was packaged with it at Target."
4,Nice way to tie old and new,"I've been addicted to Batman my entire life, and I love the direction this series has taken. The revelations and answers during the climax would probably only be believable in Gotham but other than that it's a perfect Batman flick. Dark scenes, good lines, fast flying car evading laser chase, and engaged character interplay. Will Friedle (Batman) and Mark Hamill (the Joker) are wonderful! The music is perfect. Dark rock with twangs of electronic and blues."
3,Just try and see past the watered down scenes,"This movie, which is the result of the great creative mind that is the Batman team, flows well, but got watered down by the censors. It's a damn shame because I read the screenplay (available at bookstores) and saw how effective the dark, edgy scenes were. Without them, the movie's climax is somewhat short of it's potential. This is the fault of the cencors. My advice: watch the DVD then go back and read the screenplay. And just enjoy the fact that you're watching a really cool Batman DVD."
4,Liked the edited one - LOVED the uncut,"Yes, they DID edit out some important stuff, Yes most dialogue cuts are utterly pointless (they even edited the dialogue in the bugs bunny cartoon Terry is watching with Ace) and yes the original one has a lot more power, but the bottomline is: this movie is still good. Not as good as the original, but good. The animation, the story, the voice acting... everything works. Oh, and Mark Hamill? Talk about his best portrail of the Clown Prince ever! The movie is recommendable in both it's forms, but if you have a chance to see the UNCUT version, do it! Or get the screenplay so you know what you're missing. FUNNY NOTE: Did anyone else notice that Terry is suddenly wearing a seatbelt when his driving the batmobile in the edited version? He isn't in the uncut."
1,This is Terrible,"To all those people who say that the quality of the movie did not suffer terribly because of the censorship and blatant lies by The WB, I present to you: The Return of the Joker. The entire premise of this film was knowing that violence solves nothing and if you go to far ytou will be haunted. This has been homogenized and spat out. The cuts also destroy most of the terror of the Joker. The resulting film isn't terrible, but it is disjointed, skippy, and almost bland. Don't give them the satifsfaction. Do not buy this film for yourself or your children."
5,"The best of the ""Batman Beyond"" and Mark Hamil as the best Joker.","Wow. This will rock your world. A great, serious dark, smart, and extremely well animated feature. I was shocked at how good it was. I was disapointed by season two of Batman Beyond, but this feature is everything Batman Beyond should be. And to hear Mark Hamil one more time as the Joker - and this time as the most lethal and evil of all Jokers, is really a thrill. This is the cream of the top of WB animation. Get it. Watch it. Love it."
4,A classic Batman story,"If you are a fan of Batman, buy this movie. Though I only saw the edited version of this movie, I thouroughly enjoyed it. It has all the elements that make a classic Batman story. Bruce Wayne`s guilt at the danger his partners are exposed to, classic detective story twists, and an ending that put a lump in my throat. Though this story is geared towards a younger audience, it has depth and intrigue that will hold the attention of most adults. A great movie, and one that any fan of Batman should own."
3,GET THE UNCUT VERSION!!!!!!!!!!,"this was an awesome movie, but do yourself a favor and buy the uncut version instead its so much better"
2,sorta disapointing,"its not the uncut version i thought it would be, i bought it and its still the regular version and its disappointing. It doesnt have a setting where you can play the regular version or uncut version which I think would be great."
3,BANG! That's not funny.,"In my opinion, this movie (director's cut) got considerably close to being rated R. The most offenive thing might be the flashback with Tim Drake (Robin). I believe the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill, yes, Luke Skywalker) said, ""I had to peel a few brain tissues away."" Batman (Terry McGinnis, not Bruce Wayne) and the Joker saved the movie from being unwatchable. Bottom Line: Do not let younger children watch this unless they can handle PG-13 type violence."
3,Wheres Mask of the Phantasm?,I did like Batman Beyond but how does this movie get a Blu ray before Batman: Mask of the Phantasm arguably the greatest full length animated super hero feature of all time? Please Warner Bros. explain that to me.
3,Not for little ones,"I mistakenly bought this for my 4 year old, as I was fooish enough to forget cartoon doesn't equal children anymore. Robin gets tortured into insanity and commits murder. Interesting for me, but too much for the little guys."
2,"RE: UNCUT VERSION..please read, February 17, 2002?","... The upcoming ""Return of the Joker"" has the scene that completely changes how the characters are viewed -- mainly, the completely ""different"" way in which the Joker dies, and who (not accidentally) kills him. It changes the whole movie.There is also, a great deal of symbolism lost -- Like the very first scene, which is cut.Don't buy the edited version, unless it's for your kids. The unedited version is much more violent.In the end, it's not the best in the current crop of Batman animation being released. It was good, but not great.""Sub-Zero"" was great."
3,Product Review,Kids love it This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying.
5,Way to finish Batman Beyond with a bang!,"I'll start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent. This movie takes place in the Batman Beyond universe which is about 50 years into the future. Bruce Wayne is old and mentors a newer, younger Batman - Terry McGuinness. This movie concerns the - you guessed it - the return of the Joker. Throughout the three seasons of Batman Beyond I was always wondering when the Joker was going to show up. This movie not only explains where he has been, but the shadows of Batman's past are also explained. Adults and teenagers will love this movie. There are a few scenes which may be disturbing for younger viewers, but overall this is a fantastic experience and a must watch for any Batman Beyond fan."
1,Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker,"It could have been good, but over 14 minutes of the movie has been deleted (as mentioned numerous times, almost proudly, in the creator's commentary). I am not a major fan of Batman Beyond or Batman in general, just a fan of good movies and good animation and this one falls short. Also beware of what the back cover of the DVD states, there is NO deleted scenes of the 14 minutes censored from the movie, just deleted storyboard footage that wasn't even animated. Just another way of ""nickle and dime-ing"" the consumer, they will most likely come out with a ""Director's Cut"" in the future to further milk more money from the fans."
4,"Great uncut version, great used DVD!","The uncut version is better that the edited version. The quality of the used DVD was almost like new, with no scratches. Thank you!!"
2,Call me a die-hard purist but...,"this ain't Batman. ... The only part where this movie shines is the flashback to where the REAL Batman has his final meeting with the REAL Joker. The rest of the movie is either predictable, derivitive, or just plain flat. Do yourself a favor and rent this before you buy it. I give it 2 stars for at least having Batman in it. Otherwise it would rate no stars at all.Hey, am I the ONLY one who is bothered by the fact that we had a chance to have a Batman movie where he has a final, climatic showdown with the Joker, only to have it cut up and sandwhiched into a Batman Beyond movie.Think about it! You were cheated! There should have been two movies here. A Batman-Joker movie, and then the Batman Beyond movie as a sequel. Instead we get neither. This [stinks]!"
1,edited version is a letdown to original,"i'm fortunate to have seen the original, unedited version of this film and it's fantastic. THIS dvd however is definitely a letdown and not the same movie. warner bros. should never have touched the original. am not recommending this hacked piece of entertainment."
5,The Joker is back and better/worse than ever!,"This is the best Batman cartoon to date including all the series episodes as well. The Joker is back, but wait...he has to be an impersonater right? The real Joker died decades ago...didn't he? The plot of this movie is incredible and the final gut wrenching twist will have you squirming in your seat wishing you could turn away...but for those of us who know the depraved and evil mind of the Joker, it comes as no surprize and we even begin to wonder why he didn't come with something so deranged years before. Pick this movie up but be warned it is not for the faint of heart."
4,Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (Uncut),"I have waited a long time for an animated feature that would really bring out the dark, dangerous side of the Joker. Here it is.With censorship taken out of the picture, Joker is finally allowed to reach his full potential: he tortures, kills, and commits atrocities that would never have been allowed in any of the TV series.Joker fans: you need this movie.Robin haters: ditto.Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"
1,edit version is too horrible,I saw the cut and uncut and man the cut version was edited so much that it didn't even look like a movie. *spoiler* When Bonk was gassed instead of being shot the reanimation looked so fake. So did when tim pushed Joker to his electrocution instead of being shot. The weirdest part is that WB had to change some dialouges in the film too. I felt like it was edit so much that all of a sudden I find myself at the end already. The only good thing about the edit version is that it is better to watch on your t.v. rather then open your computer all the time just to watch the uncut one.
5,"""Return of the Joker"" The way it was meant to be!","Confused? Didn't they release this movie awhile ago on DVD? Yes, WB did, but it was a dumbed-down, kiddy version of ROTJ. This DVD contains the first version complete with all the distubring, violent scenes that were edited out. This DVD also has the film's first commentary featuring Bruce Timm. I won't give away any story details, but this DVD is a must for any Batman fan. Even if you don't like Batman Beyond (shame on you!), buy this movie anyway. You won't regret it."
3,"Good, but wait for the Un-Cut version","This is by all means, a good movie. Done in the animation style like the TV show, but slightly better. However, because we're in America, (not, say Japan) this is a slightly more ""tame"" version than was originally intended. I have seen the un-cut version, and it far outranks this one. However, the core of the movie remains the same, but in the un-cut version, the story is more powerful.Mark Hamill is, as usual, completely awsome as the Joker. When the original series aired on Fox, the producers cast him perfectly, and he just keeps getting better. Any Batman episode with the Joker is worth it. This movie is no exception. The climatic battle between the Re-vamped Joker and Batman is spectacular, and my favorite part of the movie. The Joker is bar far, the best that any animated series could hope for.All in all, a good movie, but wait for the un-cut to come out. (It's on it's way.) Things will make a lot more sense."
5,Best BATMAN movie since Keaton and Nicholson!!,"This movie and DVD were terrific. I was really impressed with the depth of the storyline and the kicker about the Joker's Return. A word of advice. DO NOT...repeat...DO NOT read the Character Bios in the Special Features section prior to watching the movie! They give away the movie's big secret! I made this mistake. The movie was still fantastic, but would have been better if I had not already scanned the Bios. I won't give anything away, but part of what makes this such a great movie is that some loose ends from the original Batman animated series' are cleared up. With the state of the live-action Batman movies, you can't go wrong with this series and this DVD!"
3,Hmmmm.,"I'm not sure of what to say about this film. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I wanted to. All I'm saying is that don't let the other reviews get your hopres up iif you are both an anime and Batman fan. Its good but, it could of been better. Or maybe I just like the JOker better than batman. hehehehehehehhe >:>"
5,Awesome,"This uncut version is 10 times better than the previously released version. There are more graphic and more disturbing scenes, just the way Batman should be!! If you can, try to see this version as your first time watching, it makes the previous version look like it was made for kids! A definite buy for anyone who likes animation or Batman."
3,Teen Read,"This book may be a little boring for teens, but it has good practical advice in it. They will benefit from it if they take the time to read it."
1,One of the worst fantasy novels ever written,"Far too full of trite in-jokes, token character appearances (some of them completely butchering characters who have been well-developed elsewhere) and a stupid, unconvincing plot, this work is entirely a waste of paper. If anyone other than a high-up at TSR had written it, it would never have been published."
1,"By far, the worst in the Forgotten Realms Series","This is, without a doubt, the worst-written fantasy book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The fourth-grade plot basically goes out of its way to incorporate old jokes and bad puns - the sort you find inside bubblegum wrappers! I would suggest that time would be better spent reading two of the Forgotten Realms Series' ""superstar"" authors: R.A. Salvatore and Elaine Cunningham. Everything they write is a late-night page turner."
1,Too horrible to describe.,"This isn't just one of the worst Forgotten Realms books , it's one of the Worst books period! That was money and time that I will never get back. I'm surprised Mr. Thomsen hasn't been sued for plagiarism. This is a total disgrace. Stealing ""Around the word in 80 days"" and attempting some pathetic intergration with the campaign guide. I'm not sure if it's just the writers ineptitude or the publisher trying to swindle us. In either case they both should be ashamed of themselves. I only wish Amazon would let me rate this in the negatives. I'd give it - 10 stars. Save your self some pain and skip this garbage."
2,Just another 'regular' Forgotten Realms novel,The book starts out OK. Volo gets stuck with a lazy travelling companion and he is thrown into a world tour adventure that promises all kinds of action in the different cultures and climates of Toril. But although the adventurers travel through all sorts of places the author moves too fast and does a poor job of using the rich variety of cultures that we all know FR has. The author then tries to keep the reader interested throwing at him many well known FR heroes to help out Volo and his friends.Volo himslef is well depicted in the book. But the travelling companions were not a good supporting cast. The special appearences by the FR heroes leave an even worse impression.
4,Just read the review,"This novel was not meant to be a serious work. Something that could be compared to Chaucer, or Shakespeare. The other reviewers seem to have missed that. Its light, full of bad puns and terrible jokes. A pleasent diversion from more serious titles, Once Around the Realms accomplishes its objective to simply be fun."
3,A review on Once Around the Realms,"Athough all Volo's stories tend to be really good to read this one hasn't got the same luck... At a first glance it may look like a good idea, to have a book in which such a charismatic character goes around the map of Faerun, but the book does not take this great chance to show the realm to its readers, and the travel itself gets extremely superficial... To make things worse this story is quite tiresome, as its plot develops quite slowly... If you like Volo, VERY MUCH, then you should buy, otherwise I wouldn't suggest it..."
4,good or bad,I know that most people dont like how Brian M. Thomsen wights or how his chapters are but the main thing that most inportint is the main point of the story. iam just saying that dont pay that much time worrieing about the bad things and just injoy the book.I gave Once Around the Realms an 4 stars because I thought that this book was well wreiten and has a great ending. the only thing that I regrete is that the book hade to end.
5,A completely unbiased point of view,"The author presents a completely unbiased view of many of the worlds religions and how they have been known to view one another. The interior of the religions philosophy is compared to the actions of the its followers with incredible insight and humor. There are numerous quotations from classical texts as well as contemporary insights from the author and noted specialists in the field of conscious evolution. Don,t miss this book. Truely a great read!!"
2,Ok if you like the TV novels,"I'm not a big fan of TV novels, but I thouhgt I'd give this one a try since I like the show so much. It was about what I was expecting. The stories are told from Rory's point of view. In reading the stories you miss out on a lot of classic Loreli moments (Loreli and her mom; Loreli and Luke) It's basically a summary of what you see on the TV screen, but only Rory's side, so it seems like you're missing half of the story. I like the fast paced dialog on the show, but it seems to lose something trying to read it on the page. This was easy reading. If you need a light hearted book I would suggest this."
1,Still waiting to read this,"Since there is no way to rate Amazon like the other merchants, I will rate them here. I am still waiting for this book and my daughter has been asking for it since Nov 5 when the order was placed. I almost forgot about this order since Amazon does not send out Feedback Ratings for their own products. It is now December 14 and the product has not shipped. Again, this is not a rating for the book but for the Seller Amazon."
5,"Like Mother, Like Daughter","This book is based on the TV show, Gilmore Girls. In this book it tells about all the first Gilmore Girls episodes. Form Rory's first kiss with Dean, to the reason why Lorelai an Rory have to go the the elder Gilmore Mansion for Friday night dinners. This book is full of laughes adn will keep you reading to the end.I hope you enjoy it!!!"
3,as ordered,san disk digital photo viewer never ordered so itd hard for me to rate it all others items ok would order again
1,SanDisk Photo Viewer = DUD,"I purched this item as a gift for my wife and have returned it to SanDisk twice because it will not read a Compact Flash card. SanDisk assured me they would test one before they sent me a new one, but guess what? It will not read a Compact Flash card and the remote will not work with a Compact Flash card installed. At this point I demand a refund. The rating of 1 should read ""0"""
1,"Caution, poor product","Despite following the instructions verbatim, this product stopped functioning the first time I used it. It is sitting in its box gathering dust. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Inexpensive-and it shows,"Bought one as a gift for my very technologically challenged parents,so they could view out digital photos on something bigger than a frame, glad I decided to try it out before giving it to them. The problem was with the cheap, flimsy plastic remote. The unit cannot work without it(no control buttons on the unit itself) and the remote on this one didn't work at all. After installing batteries and pressing power, the SanDisc logo should light up, as per the instructions. Well, after pushing the button about 100 times it finally did light up and that was all it did. Remote would not scroll, change programs, not even turn the unit back off. Plus it just had the feel of something cheap and inferior, so rather than exchange it for another I just opted for a refund."
3,SanDisk Digital Photo Viewer,"Item works good, but the resolution quality is lacking. We get the same quality pictures from a low resolution picture as a high resolution picture. SanDisk's only recommendation was to check the TV setting, which are good."
1,Very bad picture quality,Compared this unit on 3 different Tvs. All Tvs showed very low picture quality when playing SD card. Same SD csrd played excellent pictures on a panasonic Sd card reader.
2,A bit disappointed,"This unit seems to be made for EU use, but did come with an adapter for USA electrical outlets. I was disappointed with how limited the menu was, and it was slow to respond to input from the remote. I purchased it for my older parents to view digital photos on their older tv, but it would be too confusing for them to navigate the menu, so I may have to purchase them a tv with a usb input instead. Good concept, just not as user-friendly as I had hoped."
3,TV as picture frame,"If you want to display a picture on your TV set this is the product that does it. The remote control makes it convenient to select among pictures and picture sets. But to set up the initial files is not an easy job. A variety of memory chips are accepted but must be preloaded on a computer first. The SanDisk Photo Viewer has not graduated from the MSDOS era and accepts only DOS names of 8 characters. Any shorter names are expanded with the wiggle and some numbers and any longer names are rejected. But use a dash in any of the names in the set, nothing will work anymore. If you liked MSDOS you will like this product otherwise find somebody who does."
3,Works pretty good,"This is a good way to view your digital photos with friends and family. I just wish the resolution was better on my HD TV while viewing my pictures. Perhaps there's some settings I'm not aware of, but the pictures look very low resolution on the TV."
3,"Good product, but could be better","I bought two of these units, one for me and one for my grandfather and both of the A/V cable included were damaged within a week. It must be a cheap cable because the units were never moved from their original position.Overall is a good product but some features could be improved, Image quality is better when I plug my sony camera directly to my 42"" plasma instead of using this.Also, since im using a TV that should not have still images played for a long time It would be awesome to offer visualizations or a screensaver when you're using the unit just to play music files.Of course, you can play your photos while hearing music but It only works for photos stored on the unit's MMC slot which for me is a disadvantage since I only own Memory stick."
2,TOO SLOW< NEED HELP,"I bought this product, got it plugged in and all was good, so far. However, with about 200-300 pictures on the SD Card, it was taking hours for the photos to load. Then it was only loading 9 thumb nail pics at a time. When those 9 loaded I had to scroll down to the next screen to load the next photos. It is taking way too long to load and not fun at all. No way is this an enjoyable experience to view our family photos on.please help if you have any suggestions or had this problem at all. Otherwise, the product will be returned and I REALLY WANT TO USE IT!!Thanks"
3,Unique Item,This item could use much improvement but really has no competition to compare it to except the much pricier Roku products. Images are clean and clear but unit is quirky and difficult to operate. It is worth what they charge for it but I would pay double or triple for a better unit. I would not pay what ROKU asks for theirs.
3,Sandisk photo album will not read SDHC card,I purchased this product so I could view my game camera pictures on my TV set. I tried the SD card that I had and it just hung. The smartmedia card worked and so did the memory stick. Finally I looked around the house until I found a regular Sd card and it worked. Who would make a product like this that will not read an SDHC card? I am very disappointed.
3,NOT the soundtrack!,"While a great disc, this is misrepresented as the soundtrack, while in actuality is a compilation of the music from Miyazaki's animation works arranged and performed by a brass quintet. Good music, just not what's advertised."
3,Sand Garden With Not Nearly Enough Sand,"We got this for our daughter for Christmas after she did a sand art project at a local fair. The kit does not come with nearly enough sand to complete the three pictures included, it is impossible to get the excess sand back into the container and the container does not keep the sands from mixing together after it's been opened. My daughter still had fun with the kit but I'm going to have to run out and buy sand to finish doing the other two projects."
2,Fails to deliver,"There isn't much Trinity and there isn't much science in this disappointing volume. Chapter 2, ""The Role of Scripture"" discusses neither and treats us to this gem: ""[Peacocke] describes the Bible as being a 'unique and irreplaceable resource'. I agree very strongly with that assessment."" Gee whiz, who wouldn't? Not worth the $24 I paid. The book is written in the rambling style you'd expect from a speaker at Club night at the Lizzie. Goes well with port, but not much else.A more stimulating treatment of the same subject can be had by reading Kevin Sharpe's Sleuthing the Divine. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2000."
4,A Nice Formula,"I've read several Mrs. Jeffries mysteries. The author has a formula for these books, and she sticks very close to that formula from book to book. That makes her work somewhat predictable. But it's a nice formula, and these mysteries make fun reading. I commend them to those who are fascinated by the Victorian period and the relationship between servants and ""masters."""
4,A very good read,"I had a great time reading the book, it's not too over the top and an excellent review of some of the social mores of the Victorian era. The characters are starting to round out, and it is nice to be confounded by the mystery."
3,Ring,I liked the style of this ring. I wish I had gotten it in a bigger size. I was wearing this ring every day - it now leaves a mark on my thumb (the finger that I wanted it for). Would not buy this again.
4,I wish there was a sequel...,"This book is very intriuging and genuine. This story reminds me of my own personal relationship at this point of time. Dez is wild and has a history of one night stands. But one day she meets her match and has to fight for the very gorgeous Victoria. But can she hold on to someone who might actually be able to hold her down?The story takes you through the journey of a true, ""how we first met story."" It gave me goose bumps while reading it. The story is fresh and the amazent of the story keeps you wanting to turn the page. I would reccomend this book to anyone any day."
4,can i get a taste?,Great read. I suggest this to anyone looking for a good book to snuggle up with while lying in bed with the perfect woman. I will keep you ready and WET.
4,Fun even for the grown-ups!,Great game for the kids. I must say I really enjoy racing with my daughters (ages 5 and 9) First section of game is a little tricky.
4,fun for all,We fell for this game after a new year's party. After new years we looked everywhere for this game and could not find it. We finally were able to order it. Since it's arrival it has been great fun for the whole family. Great game for all ages above 3 years. Very fun at party's and my boys ( ages 3 and 4) enjoy playing with the monkey's. They aren't really doing anything but with the way the game operates the still have a blast. A very fun thing to do every once and a while.
4,My girls love it!,"I bought this game for my 6 and 8 year-old daughters. I have a hard time finding games my 6-year-old can play, but this is great. She understands the concept and can work the control. At the same time, the game is fun and challenging for all ages. Great choice!"
4,Lots of fun,This is a great game for the money and you get hours of fun with all the different games that are put into this one disc. In this game not only is it great for one player mode but it's even better in multiplayer mode. Super Monkey Balls Deluxe is awsome for partys. Get this game now because it is hard to find.
2,Not very fun...,I was expecting a fun filled adventure but it was tedious and plain. I got bored with it after one day.I thought it would be a good game for my girlfriend and I to play together but it was disappointing.It might be good for little kids though.
4,Monkeys Roll On!,"This is the newest installment of the series. In case you're wondering if this game is on Gamecube, IT'S NOT! A PS2 disk is 4 gigabytes. A GCN disc is 1.5 gigabytes. It needs more than 1.5 gigabytes. On to the review!This is basically Monkey Ball 1&2 with 100 new levels. I'm not saying it's the best though. Yes, the graphics are great, there are 12 mini-games, etc. That's true; that's why I gave it 4 stars. There are some things that have been messed up, badly. 1 thing is the menu. It is so choppy! When you move level-to-level, it takes forever. To surprise, this wasn't messed up in the other games, even on GCN! I would recommend this IF you don't mind choppy menus."
4,International Harvester shop manual ih32,A very informative manual helped me to fix my problems. Has exployded views of the part and and good how to information
4,No relation to #23,"Released by Virgin outside the U.S. and Canada.This is the edition I have. My full review is at the page for the other one.To be reissued someday by Rhino. If you don't have it already, you can always get it used like I did.""Now You're in Heaven"" could be about the obvious, but the song and even the video are almost irrevelant. My favourite track is ""Sunday Morning"". It was said that Julian was trying to sound like Bowie, and not you-know-who! You know the story."
4,treat yourself,"Lost HillsDiscovering good music is thwart with disappointment, but every now and then one uncovers a gem. Terence Martin is a little known singer song writer in the style of better known artists such as Mark Knoffler, Warren Zevon and John Gorka to name a few. Fame is fickle and elusive and has overlooked Mr Martin, but that just makes this find an even rarer gem.""Lost Hills"" is a laid back album, lyrically understated and unpretentious but with the ability to transport one into places we've all been but are unable to express.Do yourself a favour and have a listen."
3,A product of the times....,"When this first came out in the early 90's, I was not impressed. Coming from a background where I listened to people like Rakim, KRS-One and Chuck D, this was not up my alley. However, in retrospect, this is a well put together album. Sample heavy of course, using all of the sample cliches from this time period, it is ""made for the stations"". Truly a well put together album, although the lyrics are not that great. But in terms of being a Club MTV style dance record, it defintely hit its mark. I truly beleive that Mark loved real hip hop, but having Donny as a producer influenced the dance style of the record. Overall, a really high quality effort and Mark, don't be ashamed of your past... we call that a sellout."
5,Blast from the past! :),This CD was one of my favorite cassettes growing up and I was upset when my tape player ate it. I've been looking for it on CD for years and I'm happy that I found it! Great music from my past! :)
5,Marky Mark is here!,"I love this cd! I listen to it daily, its just good music to get down and funky with. I mean come on people no one should hate the player Mark Wahlberg is, I know I don't!"
4,Wildside,this CD was a good CD back in the day. but now it is just like a good wine it gets better with age. it seems even better now that i am older and have a bigger variety of music under my belt
1,Please Give Credit Where it is DUE,"What blasted the song ""Good Vibrations"" to the top was the incredible vocal by Loleatta Holloway. See her CD ""Love Sensation"" for the original tune that was sampled here...and made others rich off of her talent.Love Sensation"
1,Prints with black streaks in less than a year,I bought this toner for my dad back in nov of 2010. It started to print black streaks after 7 months of use. the original HP toner that I bought 3 years ago lasted 3 years and never had a problem. I guess you get what you pay for. Wish I bought the real thing. Warranty for defects after 30 days so the warranty is useless.
1,Avoid at All Costs,"Do not buy this book if you want to learn anything about Cascading Style Sheets!It is so full of errors - including screenshots that do not illustrate what they are meant to illustrate - that the instructions are incomprehensible.In fact, the book doesn't actually lead readers through the creation of style sheets with exercises and projects. Rather, we are expected to download and view stylesheets the author has written.If you are looking for a good introduction to CSS try 'Eric Meyer on CSS' it is much more expensive but you'll learn what you've set-out to learn."
2,Can file the file for the book at cssin24hours.com,Where are the files for the book. There are several references in the book to different links but none of them lead to the associated files.
1,CSS Fail,"I'm ""glad"" I checked this out of the library rather than buy it first.I believe the fact this book is the confusing mess that other folks have commented on in their reviews is because of poor editing and sloppy cut-and-paste jobs.You'd be better off using the ""help"" feature of whatever software you are using to learn about CSS than this hot mess."
2,More talk then scripting,"You open the book, start reading paragraphs, write a snippet of code, read another paragraph, write a block of code (that doesn't pertain to the snippet of code you just wrote) and repeat. The other author does not add and build on the previous code you wrote and doesn't build upwards. You don't gradually move upward in this book. It's all side-stepping and more reading then typing. I'm talking a page and half on a single line of code. The author sometimes confuses me by repeating a couple of words in the same sentence. Long, drawn-out, boring read, with minimal code, that doesn't get built up."
2,No pictures,"I took this book from the library with two other CSS books. This one has absolutely no pictures, I further browsed through the book looking for hidden gems. However, it did not seem to cover any topic better than the other books.So, why would I torture myself reading a book on ""style and design"" if there are no pictures?"
1,Unsupported Materials,This is the last SAMS book I'll buy. There are many reasons to avoid this book - some of the top issues:- The website with examples is not available- The layout and design of the book is confusing- There is a lot of redundant information- Very poor writing- Outdated
2,Great book but no support,"I purchased the book anticipating being able to download all the files I needed for the lessons, however, the website with the lessons is no longer there so all of the code has to be typed in. The images are not available. If the book is still in circulation, the code should still made available, otherwise it is a waste of money to purchase the book as there are others on the market that have CD's with them."
2,Regret Having Bought the Book,"I like to try out the examples myself. I have made numerous attempts to acces the book's website. I get a message from my browser that the wesbsite cannot be found. I have emailed both the author and the publisher but have not recieved a response.I have also found at least one mistake in the book. Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2 is supposed to show a web page without a style sheet vis-a-vis Figure 2.4 which shows the same page with the style sheet applied. However, they both look exactly alike."
3,Good BUT the website the book tells you to reference is gone,"The teachings in the book are fairly good. However, learning along with the book is made very difficult by the fact that you can no longer download the files that are needed. Sams should keep the website up as long as they are selling the book."
5,Great Guide for Professional Developers,"I am one of the designers of the eCommerce architecture at an international plastics company, and after reading Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours, I am pushing our development teams to purchase several copies to have on hand. It's a concise, clear guide that is of great use to professionals who don't have the time to waste with traditional training programs."
1,Absurd,"While I typically would not review a book until I have finished reading it, I was so ticked off after chapter two that I decided to share my observations. While typos and grammatical mistakes are common in technical books and usually don't bother me, scewing up 3 screenshots in one short chapter is absurd.There are five screen shots in chapter 2. Of those five, 3 of them are not displaying what the author is stating should be present. Specifically, figure 2.1 on page 23, figure 2.2 on page 24 and figure 2.4 on page 35 are displaying the wrong screens. For instance figure 2.1 is suppose to display editing a style sheet using notepad. Instead, it displays a screenshot of the actual webpage within Internet Explorer.This book may still be worth the money but buyer beware."
3,An OK reference,"After using this book for one semester of thermodynamics I didn't really feel like I had a good handle on the material. There is far too much superfluous information in this book to make it thicker. Some of the sections I found to be unnecessary, especially the first chapter. The only redeeming qualities of the book are the exhaustive thermo tables and the great deal of homework problems at the back of each chapter. As a student, you might want a book which lays down the concepts before jumping so quickly to practice."
2,problems differ in SI version and hard copy,the text is the same in both the hard copy and SI Version. But the problems at the end of the chapters are different. Meaning the SI won't work for homework problem numbers.
1,Terrible for a first-timer,"This is not a good book for an intro to thermo course! The writing is dry, the explanations poor, the math is too easy to get lost in, and the book assumes prior knowledge that an undergrad student isn't equipped with yet. I would recommend this for grad students or as a reference to professors, as the appendices are put together very well, but it is terrible book to actually learn thermodynamics from. I have had to purchase other books in addition to this one, despite the fact that I'm a good student. To its credit, there are in-chapter examples and a VAST number of end-of-chapter problems (usually over 100). If you must use this text for a thermo intro course, I highly recommend the solutions manual."
4,Caution,"I bought this book because I needed it for one of my classes. I decided to go with the softcover edition to save on cost and weight of the book, but didn't realize this meant I was buying the international edition. Beware because this book is not the same as the hardcover. The chapter problems are numbered differently than in the hardcover. I learned the hard way!"
5,fundamentals of thermodynamics,The book was in great condition and extremely fast delivery. It really helps with understanding the course material. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Fundamentals of Thermodynamics,"I am not satisfied with my purchase. Upon further observation, the name of the book and author are the only things similar with my order and the book that I received. The book is paperback and all red whenever I ordered a hard back. The most disturbing part of this order is the ISBN numbers don't match! I hope and pray by the time my class starts that I will know if this book is the correct version or not, but with different ISBN numbers, I doubt it will be the right one."
3,Thermodynamics,Book was just as stated but I had to pay over $10 extra at pick-up because it was not packaged correctly.
1,not very user friendly. the examples are hard to follow,i dont like this book because it's structure is difficult to grasp. the examples are hard to follow also.very sketchy from topic to topic
1,"useless, useless, useless","Pity I didn't read the reviews here before buying this book. You will not learn anything from this book unless you are already at the level where you can ""create dynamic applications"" with flash mx. So what's the point of the book?!"
2,"Nice code, but you'll never see it run","Very nice actionscript coding techniques, BUTMissing files, files named differently than the code that references them, installation files that don't work, scant information on how to setup the server-side stuff, and Actionscript that references labels that don't exist, etc...The authors show great actionscripting techniques, but somebody in QA fell asleep on the job. If you buy this book, you might also consider buying a styrofoam brick."
1,I think anyone who buys this book should get a refund!,"This book is awful! I know the fundamentals of programming in Flash and ASP.NET so regardless, if you are advanced or know the basics this book is still AWFUL!!! Trust me do not buy it! The Poll in the first chapter does not even work. I went to peachpress to find the updates for the book and the Poll sill will not work. The book constantly points to the CD and the CD is missing the files the chapter is pointing to. The Poll.XML on the CD does not match that in the book, I mean come on! This was all before I even got through the 1st chapter! ...... I am sure that some of these examples worked, but only in the head of the author who authored the chapter. I am so upset about this one; ..."
1,"Poor code, poor information, poorly done.","According to the blurb, this book ""is dedicated to the Macromedia Flash application developer who wants to build large scale, real-world applications."" It also says that ""each chapter focuses squarely on programming techniques.""Well, the code is frankly appalling and heavily flawed and the information on application architecture is useless, contradictory and in some cases highly suspect.It is also an unashamed advert as (despite the claimed intended audience and that all it is is parsing XML) the book claims ""it can be very difficult and time consuming to write Actionscript that understands all of these packets."" (p.96, the ElectroServer) and then goes on to try and sell you the writer's product.If I could get my money back, I would."
1,Too many assumptions!!,"This book assumes that you have a knowledge of Flash MX and dynamic database development. I regret buying this book. Also, files are missing from the CD so I had to write them (XML) myself. I think these guys just took some source code from existing applications and pasted them in the book and called themselves authors. I'm so tired of slackers! It's obvious that you guys didn't do your homework!!"
4,Don't overlook this book!,"Yes, this book's CD has a few missing files, but when I contacted the publisher, they readily sent the files to me and placed them on their website.The book itself is extremely well-written and contains some really cool applications. But be aware all of them are intermediate-advanced, so this book is definitely not for the Flash faint of heart!"
4,Definitely a hidden treasure!!,"When I first seen the title of this book, I immediately knew it was what i've been searching for. It has real-world enterprise applications that will guarantee a great future for all the individuals who harness it. As one reviewer said, this book is very advance so don't think you'll grab the concept easy, especially if you're a newbie. Also the support on the book is great. I personally like the instant messenger application, which I feel is a hidden treasure only to be found by few. The techniques in that application aren't found anywhere else and it is very high-end integrated technology. I'm glad i found that treasure. Thanks Mike!"
1,files missing???,"first chapter I read said right at the start - ""open Guestbook.xml from the CD-rom""...guest what - there ain't no Guestbook.xml file on the cd-rom...doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the rest of the book"
1,Destroyed on First Use,Never got to try product in water so can't comment on that. Used the product to play fetch but it didn't last. My dog managed to break pieces off while playing fetch and he is not a chewer. Do not recommend.
4,For a real NIN fan at heart,"This is a great CD for someone who likes to collect NIN albums...It is a good but yet highly priced version...If I had money I would collect every Nine Inch Nails album, import, single, & bootleg. Alot of people say you should just go buy the American version of this CD & The Crow soundtrack, Well that is a good idea too but I buy CDs to collect them, so this import is a good (but costly) item to buy..."
1,DO NOT BUY THE IMPORT!!!,"IF you must have Dead Souls, buy the Crow soundtrack. It's got some other cools stuff on it, such as My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, Pantera, etc. If you must have Closer, Heresy, Ruiner, etc., buy the regular version. If you must have both, buy both albums, but shun this ridiculously overpriced con job!"
5,Hands down for an awesome sophomore return!,"Nine Inch Nails' music has never dated since this and it's predecessor album ""Pretty Hate Machine"" came out what seems like ages ago nowadays. ""Downward Spiral"" is a major departure from the melodic synths of NIN's 1989 debut album and into a dark arena of rusting, decaying, and disturbing psychotic mentality. If you liked the 1992 EP ""Broken"" then you will really enjoy this album. The album cover perfectly conveys the overall sound and feel of ""The Downward Spiral"".""Closer"" is without a doubt the most memorable hit from this album as it was wildly popular on the radio back in the summer of 1994 and is an absolute classic today and for good reason: It's an absolutely awesome song. The song also has one of the greatest lyrical lines ever sung that is not all that appropriate to mention but still very much ringing in our heads nowadays."
5,Best thing i have ever heard.Ever...,I am completely speechless...I have spent my life not hearing this on vinyl.What the hell?!?! I can not believe just how good this sounds.God damit Trent Resnor! I want to crawl inside of you and die!!!!!best record ever!(not an overstatement)
1,OMG! people call this music!!???,"I'll tell you what this is, it's stuffing three chords that don't fit together into a 6 minute song that includes a 3 minute blank in the middle and then in the middle you have some weird indistinct vocal that sounds rather like a rat screaming for life. Seriously you people who listen to this, you must be depressed at the highest point omg i can't believe a recording label actually Let this thing come out anyway my point is this is NOT music!!!"
1,"HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HAAAAAA!!!","What is so edgy and interesting about this album? This doesn't even sound like industrial music (as many would have you believe.) NIN was good for one ""EP""; BROKEN. Those half a dozen songs blow this crap out the water."
5,The Best 5.1 Surround Music Album !!!,"I am a big NIN fan since their first album. When i started to interest in 5.1 music from SACD and DVD Audio. I always think about NIN music would be suitable for this new 5.1 surround sound system and then my dream came true with this deluxe edition. This album will expand your imagination of this classic 1994 album. Even the bonus SACD (not just a normal CD), 'ruiner' track is one of my fav in TDS but the demo version is also very great version !!"
5,to hell and back,"This cd sends you threw hell. Trent Reznor takes a mystic dark reveloutionary hell that no other cd can do. You go threw a twisted enigma of pain and misory felt by Trent himself. And the blackest track on the cd ""Closer"" sums up all that anger in one simple phrase ""I wanna f$@% you like an animal"". The cd is exactly like the name ""Downward Spiral"". Some of the other black and tarry tracks on the album are ""Big Man with gun"" ""March Of The Pigs"" ""Mr.Selfdestruct"" and ""Piggy"". overall it is an amazing show of musical and lyrical talent. It will leave you in awe for hours trying to figure out the meaning."
4,A new look to Nine Inch Nails,"I finally decided to write all those reviews I never did so Amazon will stop reccomending albums I already have, so...The Downward Spiral is a very different approach then Trent's other works. In The Fragile, he mixed Metal Guitars, solid beats, and all other synth concauctions he could come up with. In Pretty Hate Machine, he put out a more less-agro type album, and made a more smooth-running, gentle album. (If The Nails couls actually be ""Gentle"") Broken was one step up from PHM. Those albums are really the only essentials for a regular Nine Inch Nails fan, yet the fanatics have all the EP's, the Singles, etc. The Downward Spiral took a different approach. Trent mixed heavy, heavy synth sound with fast paced beats. Sometimes he mixed in piano, or more smooth, gentle music like ""Hurt"". Overall, this was my least favorite Nails album. But hey, it sure beats BLINK182!Eric"
5,Just too good!,This in my opinion is the best Nine Inch Nails album to date. A wonderful mix of music ranging from a dark rock to a more dramatic lighter style. The wait for lyrics in Eraser might seem long but you can be easily lost in the sound and before you know it the song is over by which making it a CD you'll want to listen to again. My personal favorite song is The Becoming because of the great music and twisted but strangely confident lyrics. I suggest you pick this one up today because you'll never regret it!
1,COOL DUDE !!! GREAT CD..................NOT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst piece of trash I have ever heard ! Hey Trent, here's some advice : All who listens and likes this sh** are loosers just like yourself. Music is supposed to be enjoyable and fun. Listening to this makes you want to want to be non-existent in society. Don't get me wrong - I like industrial music... But I fail to see what the big whopla is about these guys ! GRAVITY KILLS has a much better sound and melody. Listen to THAT cd and then tell me about NIN : Not to worry though.....In about 2 years, these guys will hit rock bottom and all the fans will be thinking: 'What the hell was I listening to ?'"
1,Whats wrong with me ?,"Most music critics like this recording. WHY ??? It's filled with distorted noise that has no beat or rythem to it - and most importantly, no redeeming qualities. I must be missing something (thank God for that). Degrading, depressing, sexist, ect., ect."
1,Help us all....Trent's lost the will to live,"NIN is a disgrace to the music industry ! If they think this stuff is cool and inventive, I want to know what kind of drugs there taking so I know for sure NEVER to take them ! I feel sorry for anyone who buys this. But remember - there's always the used cd shop to sell it to."
1,"It was disgusting, how could any one like it?","The song ""Closer"" was very disturbing. This kind of music takes no kind of musical talent so why do peoploe like it?"
2,Worst NIN album...,"This is NIN's worst album, some songs are great like the masterpiece's Closer and Hurt, but most of it is filler or songs that never got the direction it desearved. It's actually kind of...boring. I prefer any NIN album instead, especially the godlike The Fragile."
5,"Genius, Simply Genius","The Downward Spiral was the album that got me into NIN. The first listen I wasn't too impressed with the album I mean I thought it was fair but nothing special.But I knew something was there something beautiful so I decided to give it a second listen and when I did and it changed my life. The sound is brutal, harsh, and loud and normally the instruments he uses would never work together but somehow Reznor uses those to make this beautiful haunting music that stays in your head and wonder how someone can come up with this.But the theme in this album is not only the Downward Spiral in Reznors life but in this world in general.This album covers alot of the dark side of human nature that very few people are willing to recongnize and talk about. And the song ""Hurt"" is the most beautiful song ever written I cried hearing that song cause everyone at some point in their life could relate to it. So when you buy this album have an open mind and listen to it as it is, Art."
5,step right up...,"If you're really pissed off, listening to this cd is the ultimate catharsis. Even if you're not, I recommend this cd. From the sheer rage expressed in ""March of the Pigs"" to the incredible beauty of ""A Warm Place"" this cd never disappoints. I love every line, every word, every beat of this disc. If you buy this, listen to it from beginning to end at least once. Trust me, you won't regret it."
5,"Bleakest recording ever, and best of the 90s","Trent really outdid himself with this one. Every song flows into the next, and are all incredible. Though most people will hope everything sounds like ""closer,"" which is far from reality, as each track is very different from the rest. Some will take ""Big Man With a Gun"" and say that's the way the whole CD is, but that's also wrong. It's a concept album, a story of a person on the ""downward spiral"" of life, and it eventually ends in suicide. It's the only CD of my collection that i listen through it the whole way on a consistent basis, and i believe that most owners of it can do so as well."
5,Words can't descride The Downward Spiral,"This ablum is godly, it should in every CD collection. The Downward Spiral isn't almost perfect, it is a perfect ablum. From the beginning to the end, the ablum pulls you in and never lets go until you are hurting and left wanting more. Just after one listen to the whole CD, you will love it (well I loved it after the first listen). With powerful songs after one another and with a beautiful ending with ""Hurt"" you will never get bored of this CD. But what makes this CD even better is what it talks about and how every song meaning relates to the other songs. So you can say Trent Reznor is a musical genius. So do yourself a favor and go out and buy this CD or just order it online from this website but whatever you do, just buy it."
5,Explores the human mind with awesome effects,"Trent Reznor has to be the greatest song writer ever. His lyrics and tearing beats, reach deep within your soul to grip you and share the pain and suffering from the album. This is purely an album of suicide and loneliness. But dont let that scare you off, its much more interesting. Also be sure to check out his other work, such as Further down the spiral. Dont listen to that person who gave it one star, if he/she didnt like it, he/she shouldnt have wasted time posted anything. If your a fan of dark or industrial/rock music, be sure to check out Trent Reznors work, and be prepared not to sleep."
4,DARK and good.,"Definetly a highly rated album... ""Hurt"" and ""Closer"" are the high points and most popular. ""Big Man With a Gun"" is great!Overall very DARK. It leaves you with the feeling that you have just watched a bloody satanic horror movie at 2 AM by yourself.It is well blended. The theme of the album flows well. I could not see listening to this entire album very much, but then again some people do watch ""House of 1000 Corpses"" more than once now don't they?I think it is a strong album, but in my opinion I do think it has been over rated in some sectors."
2,i do not want this,this is great! the lyrics are great! but the vocals are bad! i think that vocalist could have been much better!
3,"Don't listen to A music fan from Tampa, FL United States","A have nothing against A music fan from Tampa, FL United States, but you have to get the right soundtrack in your review. Dead Souls was covered for the original Crow soundtrack, not Lost Highway. You should get every soundtrack that Trent does work on, by the way!Whether or not the story and the theme throughout this disc are true to written form (and not interpretational form), the extra track throws the feel of the disc off. Whoever ""threw"" this track on this disc should be hurt. I guess that there is a convenience factor about having your favorites all on one disc, but if you love NIN, you won't let the fact that they don't have the Xtra track on the orignial pressing get you down. Leave the rest of the tracks to do that! :) One kick ass album, though."
2,Buy this if you don't know English!,"Musically, The Downward Spiral is ok. Interesting here and there and boring in other places. But the as soon as Trent Reznor starts singing I start to cringe. Lyrically he's HORRIBLE! Big Man With A Gun is the worst offender, but Closer and Hurt are also prime examples of his lyrical ineptitude . The only song I can stand is Ruiner, but most of the time I pertend he's a foreign musician speaking in some unknown language."
5,The soundtrack for Lucas' THX,"As everyone else has pointed out this a great album and an absolute NIN classic, but what no one else has mentioned is that this cd was written as a soundtrack for George Lucas' film THX 1138. Start the cd as you see ""Directed by George Lucas"" go off the screen and sit back and enjoy the film and c.d with a new perspective. The c.d ends short of the film and that's when you pop in either of the further downward spirals to finish of the film in two different ways."
2,alright,"It took me a while to get used to this cd.Although I had been familiar with the song ""Closer"",which is a song I absolutely adore,as there are a few others I sort of liked,this album wasn't my type.But I will admit,Trent Reznor is a genius and does write some wonderful lyrics.If you are a NIN fan,or like pop-industrial type of music,I reccomend this cd."
1,"Fantastic Album, Horrible Release","I give this album one star solely because the CD side WILL NOT play in a computer! I love the content of the album; it's one of my favorites. The remixes are all pretty good, from listening to the album in a CD player or as a DVD. I'm not sure if it's some sort of copy protection that prevents play in a computer, or poor manufacturing techniques, but either way the producer of the album should be ashamed."
5,this album needs 5 stars,"this album is a legendwhy doesnt isnt it rated 5 stars? it should beits a total legendif youve never listenend to this, then your missing out totally on musicthis is a one in a kind, totally unique masterpiece, with a distinct sound that no other person/band can achieve or outdooh yea, and get their new album, its good, for flexible people who understand 'change' and appreciate it, for the good"
4,Very good! Something new to hear.,"One thing I like about this album is that it's something new to my ears. I'm always listening to similar groups like Green Day, The Offspring, and such. It's not that I don't like them, as a matter of fact, I like them very much, it's just that it gets a little old and I wanna hear something new. That's where NIN comes in. I like it how Trent Reznor combines alternative rock with alot of cool and electronic effects. It sounds really neat! I only have two little problems with this c.d. One is the song ""The Downward Spiral"". It sounds pretty cool, but it is also just junk. It sounds like it was recorded in a metal box because the music is all muffled in the background. The other problem is that some of the songs start out too slow, such as ""Eraser"", ""Reptile"", and ""Hurt"", but they get better as they progress. Anyway, I highly recommend this c.d.!"
3,"Good, not as good as PHM though","Pretty Hate Machine was perhaps one of my most favorite albums of all time, but to be truthful, I didn't think about buying the downward spiral until I heard ""Hurt"" on an episode of ""Homicide: Life on the Street"". True to form ""Hurt"" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. The rest of the album is decent, with ""eraser"" and several other songs standing out. Not nearly as good as Pretty Hate Machine, but ""Hurt"" takes the cake."
5,Essential Cd for the New music,"The people say that the new rock music will be a consequence of the Rap-Metal fusion. I think that's wrong. The new rock music (and not only rock) WAS beginning by the NIN first halo (Pretty Hate Machine). This is (until today) The Trent Reznor's Masterpiece. I think ""the downward spiral"" in the 90's is like ""Magical Mistery tour"" (for the beatles)in the 60's. and i'm not overweelming because i make this comparison because of their influence in the world music. Don't matter if you are old, young, black, white, Latin, this cd is essential for whose who calls himself ""People who knows music"""
5,I love it.,"This has to be the best album NIN has ever done! I know, I know... it isn't as hard as pretty hate machine... BUT IT IS! It is actually more so. Of course it is so intellegent you can't evenm think straight after listening to it... BUY IT!!!"
5,What is that guy from maui thinking?,"I just read a review by a ""music fan"" from Maui, Hawaii, and i feel that someone must respond to this disgusting slander of nine inch nails. First off, Rob Zombie is NOT industrial, he is heavy metal, and the same goes for Marilyn Manson, at least until ""mechanical animals"" came out. And if he thinks that either of these bands are better than nin, i challenge him to find any one song on a manson or zombie album that is even half as emotional, beautiful, and heartfelt as ""hurt"" or ""a warm place,"" and if he can, i will eat my ""march of the pigs"" CD single. Don't get me wrong, I am a big Rob Zombie fan, and I find manson to be entertaining at least, but to imply that either of them can trounce nin is an insult to every person that has accepted the genius of Trent Reznor."
4,Not too bad,"Well it's like some people said before me, some people just hate it because....well the Explicit lyric.....well hello people, this IS how people talk, and we don't learn it from anyone but our parents. Also I'm betting quite a few hate it because Trent could musically beat the pants off of his Contemporaries (like 2Pac, and Snoop Doggy Sh*thead...er Dogg)and to be honest, yes some of the songs do suck. My actual Favorite is #2 (Heresy) and another is the much talked about Big man with a gun (why does this seem like a rasberry to all the 2 Live Crew wannabe rappers of 93-94?) Maybe if they would actually sit down for a few hours and listen to this and try to get the whole THEME of the album, it's be better, because Unlike Antichrist Svperstar, the almost lyrical/musical play isn't just handed to you, you have to look and listen to the lyrics, you'll find what it really is."
5,Simply Amazing,"I originally got ""The Fragile"" and that took some getting used to, but its to this day one of my favorite albums. Then I picked this up used for a few bucks, and wow. This piece blows away ANYTHING I've heard in years. Such an amazing and precise piece. It takes a lot fo getting used to, but once it sinks in you can't help but be amazed at the depth of the music. Get it, well worth the money."
5,"The Downward Spiral, a masterpiece.","The Downward Spiral is in itself a tradgedy. Rife with symbolism, both musical (notice the similarity between the melodies on the tracks ""closer"" and ""the downward spiral""?) and lyrical, this work tells the story of a self proclaimed nietzchian superman, his transformation to the place of god (and how he percieves god), and the eventual outcome of such a philosophy. In its entirety it is the most powerful album i have ever heard."
5,harrowing,"I have to agree with the other reveiwers who write that this is a great album, and brilliantly craftedPersonally i can't listen to it that much, its the most edgy, agro, angst ridden album I know of. The guitars and the noises are honed just right to carry you from the edge of depression to the depthsAnd you can sing along with it!Not sure if its cathartic or not but it sure screams."
5,Nine Inch Nails Masterpiece,"This is NIN's most influencial album produced. It roots itself in the heart of a rock, industrial, electronic, and lets not forget, classical-based musical style. Trent Reznor creates the soundscapes, undertones, collages, and raw cutting noises which all merge to form a thematic masterpiece. The rolling format of songs can be well compared to that of Pink Floyd's, The Wall. The best part of this production is Trent's great attention to detail. Just listen to the album with earphones on and you'll suddenly see a world of difference."
4,Another very good album,Nine inch nails have found their keys to make good music. The production for another time is amazing and most of the tracks are unique and very good. If you are new to Nine inch nails try this album or The fragile.
5,Pure perfection,"The Downward Spiral takes you on a journey, nuff said. Very few albums, especially today, pull you in and take you on a ride that pulls out all of your emotions. You'll cringe, get teary-eyed, but in the end you're relieved you got through it. This is pure intensity with absolutely beautiful melodies."
5,obviously a Kenny G fan,"This guy Jeff Red is obviously a Kenny G fan. If he cant realize that the band is Evolving (yes jeff ""evolving"") maybe he should have saved his money instead of buying the Cd.I personally think this album is one of Nine Inch Nails Many Masterpieces.This album is full of well thought out lyrics, this guy just doesnt understand where the band has come from or is going. i'd reccomend this album to anybody i know. this album incredible, and with a great price (thanks amazon.com.to conclude jeff red does not know anything about Nine Inch Nails and he is living in the past do not trust his opinions."
1,This version will not operate on computers... No using with MP3!!,"Will not run on my computer... love the content however I keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my MP3. I will be demanding a refund! DO NOT BUY if you have a MP3 supported car stereo, if you plan on playing at your computer.. IT WILL NOT WORK DUE TO ILL CONCEIVED PIRACY PROTECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"THROW A BOMB AT ME, BUT...","I thought that this album was very boring. Though at rare times it was very good, (closer, piggy, man with a big gun, downward spiral), the rest of this album is just extremely repetitive and boring, in my opinion. Most of the songs sound the same to me. I suppose that you could compare that desciption with KoRn's title album, a lot of them just sound the same. Sure, you can flame me for hating a ""Great"" album, but i was extremely disappointed."
3,Great sound makeover for a pretty decent cd,"I enjoy listening to this cd every so often but know that its a delux edition with exra tracks theres more reason to get this bad boy.Now I also recomend you pick up my favorite NIN cd, pretty hate machine, thats a classic.Also if your into this kind of sound I have others to recomend also like, earlier Maralyn manson cd's , my all time favorite SAMHAIN ( glenn danzigs band after the demise of the Misfits), Skinny puppy, Ministry and even romstien(sp) ?.Anyway I highly suggest you pick up any SAMHAIN cd, tape or original vinal you can get your hands on.Its a mix of punk-NIN type synth ( they were influenced by Samhain) and hard rockin power cords that will ingulf you with gritty sound and the best lyrical genious ever Glenn Danzig."
1,"as a side note, i have listened Downward Spiral more times than i can remember...","Ya, you're really, really scary and depressed Trent Reznor (NIN), just like the stupid people that follow your music. If you want industrial rock that doesn't induce fitful attacks of tear producing mirth, than listen to Godflesh. Broaderick and Co. grab Reznor by his long hair, string him up and kick the chair out from under his feet. It isn't a contest. Out of the kindness of my heart, I will even mention the four best Godflesh albums for those of you not in-the-know: Streetcleaner, Pure, Hymns and Us and Them."
3,SKINNY PUPPY,"This album is good, but it's more for the main stream kids, if you want dark and heavy sounds try SKINNY PUPPY or WUMPSCUT! And if your new to NIN (kinda hard to belive when 8yr. olds like it) get the borken ep. it's much better."
4,The baby of a musical genius,"If there's one thing that Trent Reznor does more consistently than 99.9% of the bands, its that he makes phenomenal sounding, original CD's. Sure, we have to wait 5 years after each one, but the case with most bands is that we have to wait their whole career before we get one that deserves half the merit such sprawling, ambitious works such as this and The Fragile should have and have received. This is truly remarkable craftsmanship at work here, with songs such as Mr. Self Destruct and the instrumental A Warm Place that would be completely awful if a merely decent musician had composed them. This album is original and exciting from track 1 to track 14, varying to synth-pop, speed metal, ambient and Doom-style metal. You should really check this one out, its a classic"
4,"Hate to give it 4 stars, I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could","This album is certainly well done, even though the song placement is odd and doesn't make sense at first. However, the way the songs click together once you get used to it is amazing. It is not a gradual progression towards insanity as much as a shaky, bumpy rollercoaster, almost bipolar between violent rage and almost tranquil depressiong, with some repressed anger showing through. My personal favorites are piggy, heresy, ruiner, a warm place, and hurt, but I enjoy all of the songs. It almost seems as though downward spiral is the end of the album, and hurt is an extra song, but maybe it symbolizes a new beginning. This CD has some very good songs and is worth getting."
4,"Not a huge fan of industrial, but","This was a pretty good cd. Trent Reznor is an absolute genius/psychopath, and a complete perfectionist, and I admire the fact that he rights, performs, records, and mixes all of NIN's albums, almost exclusively by himself. Brilliant. And the videos were prettty cool, as well as the interactive discography section. The video for Closer reminds me of a Darren Aronofsky film (the part with the beating heart will remind you of a certain scene involving a heart in Aronofsky's movie ""Pi"", also great, and a film fans of NIN will invariably love)Anyways, check it out. Its only $1 more than the regular version of TDS, but if you already have the 1994 version, i wouldn't necessarily rush out and re-buy this one."
5,"Trent Reznor, you magnificent bastard!","To hear this already masterpiece of an album digitally remastered and remixed for 5.1 surround audio, it's enough to make a grown man weep. The bass is heavier and the sound is much sharper. I must give credit where credit is due: Trent Reznor outdid himself once again by making an already perfect album even better. The second disc is an incredibly good mix CD of some of NIN's best remixes, movie soundtrack songs, and a couple of previously unreleased goodies to top it off. I was a bit disappointed that ""The Perfect Drug"" didn't make it on there, but it still includes the songs created outside of TDS including ""Burn"" (Natural Born Killers), ""Closer (precursor)"" (Se7en), and ""Dead Souls"" (The Crow). In other words, if you're a NIN fan, even if you already own the original as I do, I highly recommend this album for the sheer quality you get from it. Enjoy"
1,"Yeah, right.","I would rather listen to Helen Ready and Barry Manalow sing 'Sunrise, Sunset' than listen to this garbage ! Give me a break ! I like hard rock and metal with some craftsmanship to it - This is just a chore to listen to. I'll give them the first song of the cd, which is very good....After that, nothing but the PITS !"
1,Just one good song on it,"Alright, ""closer"" is a hell of a piece of music, I admit it. The rest of this album bites, however. It is a lot of noise-really grating noise-that doesn't warrant a second listen. Sorry I bought it. Don't but this thinking that the rest of the album is as good as ""closer"" because it isn't. Next time I will stick with the single off one of this guys albums."
1,Depressing and very degrading,"Why make noise like this ? It's a waste of time and most of all, money. I STRONGLY recommed you NOT buy this. I sold mine to a used CD shop and I'm sure most people will do the same thing."
3,Powerful...the cover art that is,"The Downward Spiral is the perfect album if you want to make your parents angry. Otherwise all its doom and gloom gets old really quick. Songs like ""Mr. Self Destruct"" and ""March of the Pigs"" sound awesome with their fast, brutal onslaught; ""Hurt"" is a haunting close to the album and will get under your skin. But over the course of fourteen songs, the whole severe misery mood, both lyrically and musically, is driven to the point of stupidity. The narrator should turn his frown upside down and get a prozac prescription. You should buy the Downward Spiral if you're willing to settle for a record with a handful of good tunes. If not, keep looking and keep that piggy bank in tact a while longer."
2,Only enjoyed 2 songs,"For NIN's 2nd full-length album, this one didn't hold up for me. I only really enjoyed ""March of the Pigs"", and ""Closer"". As 1 viewer stated in the headline of his review, it's an audio suicide note. Trent was going through a terrible time during this recording and it certainly shows not only in this one, but also on ""Further Down the Spiral"". When I was younger I used to love this album. Recently I stuck the cd in my stereo and ended up turning it off after a few songs. Not my favorite anymore. Sorry."
4,Two Thumbs Upward for The Downward Spiral,"Okay, I don't necessarily buy into all of Trent Reznor's lyrics (""God is dead, and no one cares...""), but poetry aside, this album deserved all of the critical acclaim it received. The Nine Inch Nail composed what I consider to be one of the best albums of the 1990's, and Reznor shows that Industrial music is not just out there to be danced to. Nine Inch Nails uses a superb mixture of high-reverb guitars, keyboards, sound effects and beats to portray a spectrum of emotional highs and lows compressed into a flow which I feel is on par with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon."" Reznor packs a hard and noisy whallop on the first half of the album which reaches a climax with the song ""Big Man With A Gun"". After this, things slow down dramatically until the final song ""Hurt"" hits you with one big, depressing knockout punch. The feeling conveyed on ""The Downward Spiral"" is phenomenal, and it's a must-buy for alternative and hard-rock junkies alike."
5,Absolutely fantastic,"This is one of the greatest nin c.d's I've ever heard. A c.d collection is not complete with out the downward spiral. The c.d seems so flawless and well planned out, each song pulls you in farther and deeper until the disc ends. It's so full of emotion and rage, it's fantastic. It starts out heavy and slowly lightens up but never releases its hold on the listener. I have no complaints with this c.d, it's just that good. I recommend this to anyone who has ever thought about purchasing a nin c.d, you won't be disapointed, if you don't believe me just read the other reviews. I just love this album and you will too."
5,Best Record of the Decade,"I could expend hours trying to explain why this record is so amazing, or trying to tell you how every song is a piece of unique melodic complexity, but i will not. I'll just say is the best record of the decade and it doesn't matter if you do not like industrial rock: if you love music, this is a must have."
3,"Good. ""The Downward Spiral"" is an appropriate title.","As of now, I haven't listened to ""Pretty Hate Machine"" but I can't wait to. The Downward Spiral is an appropriate name for this c.d. because the c.d. seems to get worse as it goes along. Not that the c.d. isn't good, it's just that the songs aren't as good toward the end. It is also a weird album because it has alot of special effects and synthesized sounds which makes it harder to hear the words. And what is up with the ""nine Inch Nails"" band title? NIN is not a band. It is a guy named Trent Reznor. Why doesn't he just release it under his name? That i'll probably never know. But other than that is is a pretty good work of art."
2,Yawn,Big dissapointment. Waited anxiously for the release of this only to find a waterdowned version of the Reznor. Don't waste your time.
5,Best CD ever!,This CD is a must for music enthusiasts! Trent Reznor has made a work of art with this one.
4,Downward Spiral,"This was my first NIN nails cd. I will defenitely stay with these guys and continue to buy more of their albums. The album starts out with Mr. Self Destruct and just blows you away. Most of the cd is the same way. A few songs such as ""A Warm Place"" and ""The Downward Sprial"" were a little weak. The ""Downward Spiral"" sounded as if it was recorded inside a metal box. The lyrics are good just not the music. Other songs such as ""Mr Self Destruct"", ""Heresy"", and ""March of The Pigs"" show the Nine Inch Nails harder side, which is what they are. The best songs are ""Heresy"", ""Closer"", and ""Ruiner"", just to name a few. Overall it was pretty good and if you are into the hard, heavy, and a little techno music this is the perfect album to buy."
4,Still a great listen,"I'm not really into hard rock or industrial music but NIN is still one of my favorite bands because they stand out from the crowd. It has some interesting textures, breaks conventional songcraft but still is catchy enough to listen to. The self loathing gets somewhat tedious but the execution of songs like Hurt, Closure, March of the Pigs and Mr. Self Destruct is worth it. However there are some weak songs like the controversial Big Man with a Big Gun. And Reptile is pretty dull. But otherwise it's a good listen. Can't wait for the new one."
5,This was a triumph!,"Nine Inch Nails brought forth some of the best and most deranged songs ever made. They combined their unique sound with disturbing lyrics to create an intense and powerful album. From ""Closer"" to ""Hurt,"" this cannot be missed by any fan of the group!"
5,A CD to raise your children on.,"If there is anything that Trent Reznor can do, it's producing and writing the best music there is since Mozart. I have listened to NIN for three years and it took me only two minutes to understand and recognize his talent. Let's just hope his new CD is as respected and influential by and for NIN fans, new and old."
4,"To Correct,","Actually, Hurt, is originally A NIN song, written by Trent Reznor, and Johnny Cash did a cover of it. Trent Reznor was shocked and honored by Cash's request to cover a NIN song. Either way, a hell of a song and album."
5,"I always fall into the ""Downward Spiral""","This album was great, and had alot of style in it. My favorite song had to be ""Hurt"""
5,"Abrasive, Yet Listenable","The best and worst of sounds come together in this somewhat abrasive album. Dark, disturbing and definitely not for the weak of heart or stomach. The disc begins with the drug addiction tale of ""Mr. Self-Destruct"" and ends with the sensitive self-mutilation anthem ""Hurt"". Hardcore NIN fans will be totally happy; people who love Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears need not apply. The album's title track, which probes into the dark recesses of suicide and what motivates one to do it, may be too disturbing for even the most hardcore NIN fans. Common background noises include the sounds of people screaming and buzzing flies. A fair warning-do not listen to this album if you are in a rotten mood, or a happy one, for that matter. Only listen if you are ready to experience a very creepy, yet artfully executed collection of songs."
5,sound of the fury,"A trip into the darkness of human mind.Excellent industrial.As Bacon said...some books are to b tasted,others to b swallowed and some few to b chewed and digested.This album falls into the third category...it has to b chewed first(it develops a bit slowly....except some catchy tracks like Closer) and then it starts to grow on u n no doubt it keeps growing.If u dont have it dont give a second thought.Its dark(est) and if u r into industrial or heavy music theres no point u should b reading this anymore.Go n grab ur copy.Experience."
2,4 1/2 years and waiting,"Well all you NIN fans, this is the only offering we've had in almost 5 years, and looking back, it wasn't that good. two songs ""march of the pigs"" and ""hurt"" came close to anything on Pretty Hate Machine, but the rest fell victim to the trends of 93-94. Hopefully, Trent will come back with somthing excellent (As his excellent collaboration with David Bowie might indicate)."
4,This album is not the anti-christ,"After laughing myself silly over the misspellings and grammatical errors that dominate every anti-NIN letter, I must say, lighten up, people! I would like to state that I was and still am I die-hard NIN fan (for almost 5 years) and I am not a mass-murderer, satanist, or derelict. As a matter of fact, I am a college student with a straight-A average and a spotless record. I love Reznor's music because he is talented. His versatility at mixing techno sounds as well as playing live instruments is a breath of fresh air from these over-produced, cookie-cutter teen idols like Mariah Carey or N'Sync. Reznor's message may be a bit harsh for some, but it reflects the decay of our modern society and the problems faced. Granted, some numbers, such as Man With A Gun, are not in the BEST taste, but I believe Reznor might have been parodying that stupid and repetitive genre of gangster rap. All in all, if you love original music, Nine Inch Nails is a wonderful band to hear."
5,This is by far the best cd i have ever heard,"I am really surprised that so many people were offended by it. he says these things but he is just talking about stuff that is already going on, not ssomething that he started or wantss to continue. this is the music that stays in my mind all of the time...if you don';t buy this because you are ""afraid"" o it or you just think it sucks you are really missing out..."
5,trent reznor kicks ass,"I think this is one of the best cds I own..as for being sexist...well im a girl and im not offended. some people take stuff too seriously. it is only music by the way. The only song I had heard before I bought it was ""closer"" but now I love almost every track on the cd. the lyrics are great. ""Hurt"" is fully of emotional pain and has become my favorite song. I recommend this cd to everyone..."
5,love of pain,"as an long time nin fan i have to say this album did not disappoint me it shows that am not the only one who thinks that way .that am not strange i love phm ,broken and fixed i have fdts and the sin and march of the pigs cd .and i still in love with the music i like the mm album too but nothing gowing to take me from nin i say if you think your alone get this cd becuse you'ill find your in the mind of someone who probly fells like you am gonna start a band and make my own music becuse of ninand trent reznor."
3,READ THIS REVIEW!!!! IT IS HELPFUL!!!!!,"This was not a bad cd. However it has not been the best cd I have bought. When I first got it, I thought: man, what is this crap? This is the kind of cd that grows on you. If you are thinking about buying any Nine Inch Nails cd, I recommend learning about them first, because I guarentee, that they are not what you expect. I bought this cd thinking that this band would be similar to Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, or Static-X. However they are not. This album is mostly synths and few guitar riffs. This cd is not for everybody. Some of you may love it though."
5,friggin genius!!,"this is my favorite album of all time...its soooo hard to explain the genius of it, im not even going to try, or ill give my self a headache...every song on here is soooo perfect (except the downward spiral...i never got into that one very much) it definetly depends on who you are if youll like this cd or not...for example, my grandma hates this album but loves the fragile (as you can tell she is insane, but hey, at least she likes the fragile) its very very different than pretty hate machine and the fragile, but i say its the best"
5,Top of 90's,"I still remember the day I bought this CD. I played it on my stereo and after a few minutes thought ""What a waste of money"".I kept listening to it, and the more I did, the more I loved it. In a couple of weeks it was my best of the year; in a month it became my best of the decade.This one is a record full of great songs, wich are in a way related to create a great unity. You hear a song like Heresy and you feel it's great by itself, but followed by March of the pigs it grows better, and this keeps happening (then Closer, then Ruiner, etc). It really makes you feel something, and it makes you listen to it from the beginning to the end. It doesn't happen like some other records that you go directly to the best songs, this one needs to be heard from Mr. Self Destruct to Hurt.My advice is just buy it and enjoy it. It will last long."
5,The Beginning,This is Nine Inch Nails at its most raw and base. A great listen that is worth every audiophile's time. Pull the shopping trigger and jump into Trent's world.
2,"childish whining, avoid it","do any of you actually believe trent reznor really feels pain? he is just making dumb tuneless music so that people who think they have bad lives (AKA all of generation Y) will feel better about their self pitying idiocy. I had heard a lot of good things about NIN and was really looking forward to listening to this cd, but when I got I listened all the way through, and it blew hard. There is no real ""music,"" it is just a lot of sampled sounds and random fuzz tones. It honestly hurts the ears; if I wanted to hear something like this I would stand outside a construction site. Also Trent's pathetic singing and lyrics border on the mindless idiocy of all other music made today. he critizes everyone and everything, in a pathetic effort to show that only he sees the problems and the solutions. music like this makes me ashamed to be a 90's kid. don't buy it."
1,"Mr. reznor, you sir are a genius","Well, let me just say that this album is by far the greates ever made, and not since the death of Nietzche has there been such a remarkable voice to remind us about that inescapable abyss of nothingness ,via that powerful Reznor mumble then scream singing. All the songs are great, not one wink link. I have to agree with people magazine when they say that this album is the work of a truly tortured genius. this album is completely original I have never heard anything like it, it is even different fron reznor's other work, but then again no nin nail song is alike, when I listen to the downward spiral it inspires me to write macabe poetry of my own. And a special kudos to reznor for finally challenging all those American institutions that no one seems to want to tackle, religion, how individualism is drowned by the masses, what a revelation."
4,really really explicit lyrics,"I love this album, but i think i shouldnt have bought it. im sure that doesnt make much sense, but, consider this: THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING ALBUMS EVER! I was 14 when i bought this CD and i think it was a mistake. the lyrics are pure gold, but are extremely heavy (well, actually they arent extremely, but along with the music, they pound the negativity into your brain). I will warn you: this album is definately worth buying if you are ready for it, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone who is going through or has not yet passed puberty (the worst years of our lives). I am very worried about some of the bands out there that are just plain depressing. people's deaths have actually been caused (along with other things) by bands such as NIN. just think about that if you intend to buy this CD. but, if you cant stand to not get a NIN album, buy pretty hate machine."
2,Trent Reznor needs to grow up.,"""The Downward Spiral has some great songs such as 'Closer' and 'Hurt', but the rest of the album is an unnecessary attack on Christianity, religion, and decency in general. He curses at God and Christianity as though his life has been traumatized by them. ... 'Man with a gun' is probably one of the most repulsive songs ever made; truly it is there for shock value and nothing else. I don't think an entire chord was played throughout the entire album, only screechy noises and industrial sounds pollute the tracks. He sings constantly, on all of his albums not just this one, about how ""impure"" he has become. ..."
3,Pretty good!!!,"The best songs on this CD are: ""Big Man With A Gun"", ""Eraser"", and ""A Warm Place"". It's got some good beats and tunes that will keep you singing along! Especially the first few lines of ""Big Man With A gun"" Which is: ""I'm am a big old man and I got a big gun. I got a big old d**k and I like to have fun!"""
5,The best album ever!,"his is the best album ever made IMO. I love it so much, that it never gets old, never gets boaring, and always sounds fresh and original. Anybody who writes less than a five star rating is either deaf, umb, or dead. Not in a cool undead way either...just old and dead."
5,Words can not describe the greatness of this album.,"Thank you Trent Reznor.Everything that Pretty Hate Machine was, this wasn't.Yet that album is a timeless classic that set the tone for Rock, Pop, and Industrial for years to come.I love this album to death, but personally I enjoyed the Fragile more...the soundscapes are amazing."
4,One gripe,"Great book, great photos. It lost a star due to the incredible omission of Bill Haley in the 'rockabilly' chapter. I admit, he became dated very quickly when Elvis came along - Haley and band in the white dinner jackets, a bit chubby with that spit curl. but the book mentions Ike Turner's ""Rocket 88"" as a lead into the Sun Records, but fail to mention that it was Haley that was the first white guy to record it, among other R&B hits of the late 40s and 50s. Guys who were early rockbillies that became famous later (Conway Twitty) are mentioned, and also-rans like Billy Lee Riley and Charley Feathers, and pretty boys like Ricky Nelson, but Haley had the million selling records. His shows in Europe and Australia drew 10s of thousands at a time when Elvis and Jerry Lee were unknowns. Haley opened the door, and deserves to be in here."
1,Supposed to be funny.,Don't expect a self-help book. This is a joke book. One joke. The foregoing reviewers are playing along with it. Sorry to ruin it.
4,Good tactical holster,"I actually like this tactical holster better than the other ones I have even though it only has one strap. The strap has a rubberized grip that keeps it from slipping and the holster is a good general holster that fits a few different pistols, even my S&W 329PD revolver (though not great). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tactical holster except those looking for something for hunting as the material tends to be loud against bushes and such."
3,"Great Book, bad condition","The illustrations within were excellent, however, the book arrived moldy throughout with a distinct mold smell. Not an appetizing gift."
1,Bad Deal,"This was a long time ago, but I still remember I order a hard back book and got a paperback. I did write and got a nasty reply.That was the reason I have not used Amazon over the years."
5,Foster assembles diverse talent for this Christmas CD,"David Foster brings energetic and heart felt performances from the varied talent he brings together on this CD. Michael Crawford's rendition of ""Oh Holy Night"" brings chills to me every time I listen--and I listen in June! Our collection of Christmas music nearly equals our general collection and this is by far our favorite holiday CD. Every year I give this CD as a gift to my new friends around the country, knowing little of their taste in music. The gift-giver can't lose with this offering."
5,Awesome Christmas Album,"This is a great album. I was looking for an MP3 of the David Foster Carol of the Bells that I hear on the radio a lot at Christmas time and it was nowhere to be found, but I bought this and now I have it. Wonderful."
4,Christmas music,Very good cd. Enjoy David Foster's work. Nice mix of Christmas season music. Would recommend it to anyone.
5,David Foster's Christmas Album,This is my favorite Christmas Album. All of the songs by various artist are wonderful. Each artist adds their own style which makes each song so unique. It is definitely an album that adds to the holiday spirit and has made many of my holidays bright!
5,One of the best Christmas albums in a long time!,"David Foster takes the traditional ""Carol of the Bells"" and adds a little spice. His arrangement is a pleasure to hear for music lovers all over. The best piece, however, is Michael Crawford singing ""O Holy Night"". Only Crawford's tenor vioce can bring the true passion out of this piece!"
2,Love Music,"I had had the CD for years and it finally got scratched so I wanted to replace it. I absolutely love the album but by my own mistake, I ordered a cassette and thought I was ordering a CD. I don't have a cassette player to play it on so I was unable to listen to it. I hope to get things right next time and order a CD. It is very worth purchasing this album, it has a wonderful variety of music and really sets the Christmas tone!"
4,Checkmate,"Our story continues with Alvis and Dio being saved from Maestro Delphine by Luciola and Claus. Alex Rowe is continuing his torture sessions with Delphine in which she tries to extract the remaining mysterions in order to control exile which is a ship that turns the land of prestar into an earthlike environment. The tide is turning for our evil despot as Sophie and the head of the dossis people work together and attack the guild to finally end their reign of terror. You'll laugh, you'll cry,and be confused in certain parts but its all worthwhile. There are definately some issues with the story that were not developed enough but even so..I love the series and the finale is mindblowing...its definately checkmate for the guild."
2,Not very amusing,"The only amusing thing about this collection is that Dean Koontz fancies himself a children's author. The premise is a clever idea gone horribly wrong. Much of the rhyme is unoriginal or forced and some of it goes on and on and on so that we feel we are stuck in one of the author's horror novels. Stick to what you do best Mr. Koontz and leave quality children's writing to quality children's authors, please!"
5,Wow !,"When I read ""Something to Remember Me By"" I couldn't believe the treasure I had found. I immediately got copies for all my friends. It's one of those books that really gets to you and needs to be shared with children & adults. A ""must have"" for anybody who loves quality children's books."
5,This is a true story about changing.,"The story begins with the author's visits as a little girl to her grandmother's house and tells about the gifts her grandmother gives her over time, As the little girl grows, she develops an understanding--through the gifts her grandmother gives her--of why it is important for people to be remembered. This is a book that will make you laugh...and cry."
5,Share with Grandparent/Grandchild/Grandfriend,"This book shows the warm relationship of a grandmother and granddaughter. Even the ordinary seems like a special treat with Grandma. When it's time for the granddaughter to leave, the grandmother ends each visit with a trip to the cedar chest at the foot of her bed. She pulls out ""something to remember me by"". Years pass, time takes its toll, and the grandmother fears she can no longer remember well enough. The granddaughter discovers the true treasures her grandmother left. Reading this book is like stepping into my grandmother's kitchen because she also left behind a treasure chest of memories."
5,A view into my relationship with my own Grandma..,"My 92 year old Grandmother and I have the relationship that was written about. When I read this book it touched my heart deeply and brought back so many feelings about my Grandma. She recently was moved to a Nursing Home and for the first time this last visit she did not know me. This book helped me realize that just because she may not know who I am, I'll never forget who ""I"" am and how important she was in making me the person I am today. I took this book and shared it with her although I am not sure she understood it. I had her to write a message in the book and sign it with her famous ""Granny"" scribble so that I can cherish this story and someday share it with my grandchildren that I hope to have. When they look at me in wonder about why I let have anything they want at the store or why I let them have my complete attention, I'll share this special book with them. I think all chldren should have grandmothers like the one in the story."
3,"Little for the Layman, A Treasure for the Scholar","This book is a scholarly review of the subject of Gnosticism. Most of the book is spent debating the meaning of the word Gnosticism. Significant time is also spent regarding the development of a typology for Gnostic documents. In the end King argues that the word Gnosticism will likely disappear as we tire of attempting to define it.There, now you don't have to read the book - if you're a layman. If you're into the scholarly pursuit of all things Gnostic, this book is a ""must have."""
1,What a disappointment,"Such a beautiful picture this would have made. Unfortunately, the thread comes tied in bundles that the cross stitcher is expected to separate and distinguish which color is which. Also, it appears the thread is of less quality than the highly respected DMC floss which, according to the directions, will bleed.I love cross stitch as an art but please, how much trouble would it be for Dimensions to sort the thread by number. What will come next, a blank chart for the stitcher to draw the pattern? Sorry, these kits will be returned asap."
3,"All things considered, not bad...","As long as you remember what this book is trying to be, it's not a bad book. The book reprints articles that originally appeared in the now defunct INSIDE TAE KWON DO magazine. As such, none of the articles go into great details on their given topics, but you get enough general information to whet your appetite."
3,"Good for Enhancement, Not Great for Basics","As a beginner in Tae Kwon Do, I didn't find this book helpful for learning the basics. It did give some good advice though (assuming) for enhancing your abilities. However, if you are not familiar with all of the basics (i.e. punches, kicks, etc.) then most of this book will go probably over your head. Plus there are not many graphics and they are explaining different excersizes and techniques. If you are a person who learns by being shown like me, don't get this book."
2,For the beginner,"First, I am a 2nd degree black belt and instructor in Tae Kwon Do, and I approached this book from that perspective. I guess that this book could be good for the beginner as an introduction to Tae Kwon Do, but you could probably do better just by going to your dojang. I certainly didn't buy it."
5,unique smell,I love this fragrance. It smells really unique and many people stop me on the street asking about it. Love it
4,Not Like Any Other Summer Scent,"I'm a big fan of ""non-traditional"" perfumes - I don't care for sweet floraly scents, and I have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally, just to enjoy the scent all day. So if you like citrusy/woodsy scents, you MUST try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe, but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men, and the ""WHAT are you wearing?"" from women.It's intense, but it's not overpowering the way some Orientals can be. But it's also summery-light. I can't explain it - just try it. A couple of times. And for something even more unusual, try Jardin Mediterrenne (sp?) also by Hermes - the only perfume I've ever given 5 stars."
5,Amazon Verified Purchase - Un Jardin sur le Nil,"This fragrance is the epitome of refreshingly lovely summer scents. It is my favorite, also my daughter's for whom this order was intended. Pricey, yes. But so worth it!! Shipment, delivery, and product were 100% satisfactory"
1,It's scented water!,I ordered this item and when received It was scented water!I ordered this with Amazon thru sophiasbeauty.com - the item was not actual product.I brought item into major retailer and Hermes rep indicated this was a phony fragrance - it was scented water.I looked for best price and I got ripped off!Do not order from sophiasbeauty.com!
3,Almost....,"This is a sophisticated and complex scent... There is a true burst of grapefruit, only at the initial spray that disappears with in seconds...The middle notes are very spicy, lacking any citrus scent (1 hour later). The base notes are very woodsy, and the spice element lightens only slightly (after 2 hrs). It is a great pity the grapefruit portion is so short lived, it would have been a lovely overlay for the base notes.. I am very picky, and prefer musk based oils scents rather than overly sweet floral scents.. I had high hope for this after the reviews, but feel there is just something lacking in the base notes...This EDT was just ok for me, but not enough for such a high end product...It is different, but just did not live up to the hype for me personally, so I must recommend that you go into Sephora etc. and try this before purchasing..."
2,great product but seems to have been a opened item.,"I got this as a gift for my wife's birthday and she loves the perfume. Great product.But it looked like was opened already. WTF? there was no plastic wrapping around the product box and the perfume seems to have been used before. The bottle sprayed at full volume at the very first press, and there seems to be slight signs of being opened with the box. Not cool man, not cool. I don't know if that's just a Hermes quirk but it just doesn't look good when presenting a gift.If you are looking to get this.... I don't know, just be sure you don't spend $100 on something that looks like an opened item."
4,It's a book for KIDS!,"The artwork reproduced in this book is of the ultra-high quality and distinctive style expected of vintage Disney Studios products. The paper and binding should survive years of use. The storyline is typical fairy tale stuff and serves its purpose well. The text in this book is not an example of story-telling genius, but most adults, when reading it to children, will be able to ad lib subtle improvements.Bottom line: Get it for the pictures!"
4,Great story,"I thought that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a great book for kids. Its one of those books that kids love and read over and over again. The story teaches kids not to take food or anything from strangers even the least expected person. The story takes place in castle but when the queen orders Snow White to be killed she runs away into the forest. But, when the queen finds out she changes her identity and goes after her. Join Snow White in this dangerous and fun filled adventure as she discovers the beauty of the forest."
1,Snow White is Racist!,"In addition to Disney overemphasizing beauty and making fun of short people, Snow White is racist!!! Where are all the colored folks in this fairy tale? As a proud Asian, I am insulted that my daughters can find no one who looks like themselves! Why couldn't Snow White have been Asian? Then they could have renamed the story SNOW YELLOW!!! (BTW, this review is all tongue in cheek. I'm just making fun of those people using modern day political correctness to judge a movie that's 75 years old)."
3,Okey,"After re mixing it myself , i got a decent cd out of 2 1/2 ... Not bad for getting ready 2 party"
1,"same as all of the other programs of this nature, that I have purchased in the past","Over the years I have had several differant programs like this one.After listening to more then half of this set I find nothing new.The only thing good about this is, that I purchased it from Amazon so, I only had to pay $81.52.If I had purchase it from their website it would have it would have been over 100.00.I would have liked to return it but, figured since I had opened it They would not accept it as a return."
1,What a rip-off!,"This book reads like many religious nut jobs talk: if bad things happen to you it's your own fault because you did not BELIEVE!! This book is at least as bad as the Secret, which makes sense since he was involved in that too. Mike Dooley trys to get around every possible reason why this idea of you creating all of reality does not work. It is twisting and laborious. For instance, he brings up arguments other might make regarding their life experience showing it does not work."" Well, Mike, if thoughts become things is as predictable as gravity, then what about those dreams of ours that have never seen the light of day? Why haven't I won the lottery yet?"". The answer? ""We never want just one thing, and we never think just one thought..... Some of our thoughts may contradict one another or be mutually exclusive"". Get it? It's your fault!! I have two words for this work of fiction: convoluted crapola. Don't waste your time or energy on making this guy rich."
1,Thoughts become things! Huh??,And they become things if you go out and actually do something about them.You can't just think of a million millions dollars and it will show up at your door.I cannot believe I wasted the money to listen to this. And this guy became a millionaire telling people this?? Gee if only I would of thought of this!!!
2,Do I Really Want To Live My Dreams?,"Okay, so last night I dreamt that an army of Irish midgets -- not leprechauns, mind you -- forced me to don a giant, purple rat costume (kind of like the one at that rat-inspired pizza place). As soon as I put on the head, a giant toaster began chasing me around a sunny field. While I was running, the daises in the field all began chanting, ""Move to Fresno! Eat less cheese!"" Thunderhead clouds began to form in the sky and all of a sudden it began raining Brett Favre bobble-head dolls.I totally do not want to live out that dream. Thanks, but no thanks."
5,Infinite Dreams Can Come True,"Infinite Possibilities helps us image a world where we can be in charge of our own destiny. It helps us imagine that we actually can live our dreams. As the author of Ponder Picture Prosper, I have helped many people find the courage to live their dreams by upgrading them from dreams to goals.Ponder Picture Prosper: A Proven Method for Getting What You Want in Life, Love, and Work"
5,Magnificant and Inspiring,"Mike Dooley's 12 cd set, Infinite Possibilities, sets out a comprehensive, enlightening, thoughtprovoking, entertaining, and piercingly beautiful way to look at the way life works and how to make it work better for us. With wit and great empathy he takes us on a journey through our deepest questions and with a lighthearted, Tallyho! shows us the way to achieve all that we long for. An exceptional set of recordings, I highly recommend these to anyone on the spiritual quest looking for a cogent, compassionate way to understand oneself and the world we live in. Listen, and get ready to change your life forever."
5,Best yet!,"Mike Dooley has done it again, this is a wonderful book, and a great way to keep a positive attitude, just pick it up every day and get your fix!"
5,Critical to Understand,"If you're into either working with or at least understanding the great Law of Attraction, it is critical to not only be aware of, but understand the sub-laws that work in harmony with it. This book is an excellent work on the Law of Vibration. Your thoughts are the birth place of what you have going on in your life. This work will help you understand this all important concept.I recently purchased this book, which was a replacement for one I bought last year, that I believe I lent out to a client and never got back. Due to the fact that I'm writing my own book now, I looked for my copy of ""Infinite Possibilities"", for some reference work, and couldn't find it anywhere. It's definatly a must for any serious students of the Law of Attraction."
5,Something to sink your teeth into.,"I had picked up Mike's ""Choose them Wisely"" on a difficult day andI have to say it has made quite an impact. After devouring that book Iwanted something more in depth and found it with ""Infinite Possibilities"".If you want some help changing your life and creating a life that you LOVEthen read this book and put the fundamentals to work.This is not a ""heavy"" read, but it is inspiring and I found that quite a surprise.Mike lifts you up as you read his book and I must say the day I picked up thatfirst book I have not been disappointed since. He also has ""Notes from the Universe""and ""Manifesting CHange""."
4,execellent reading for self help and responsibility,"i find the book challenging and inspirational towards taking hold of where you want to be in your life. when practised, it brings you to a point of realization that has gone unnoticed in your life."
5,Infinite Possibilites in Finite Terms,"Mike Dooley has captured the essence of spirtual concepts by condensing them into practical, simply-stated explanations that clarify what we must do to make our dreams come true. He also provides advice on how to speed the process by determining whether or not we hold beliefs that interfere with the manifestation of our thoughts. I have read countless books on spirituality and find his the most impactful."
5,INSPIRATIONAL & OPTIMISTIC!!!,"Mike Dooley's writings ARE truly full of ""Infinite Possibilities""! He writes with optimism and humor in a ""down to Earth"" manner. I love his teachings and methods to living a life of your dreams and living in a state of Joy. He uses visualization to the max. A must read for followers of Abraham, Esther & Jerry Hicks, Louise Hay, The Secret, etc..."
3,repeats,repeats the same mantra as the other DVD's CD's as manifesting change. I still believe that it works though. I
5,New insights,Mike makes it easy to see the future in a new way. He takes principles that we have all heard and makes them easy to understand and apply. Who knew accountants could be so deep?
5,Thoughts become things,"Mike has a way of making you feel your life is possible to go from nothing to something. He comes off real,his own life experiences interjected into his story telling makes you not feel like he is a guru off to take your money,he wants you to launch your life with joy. Thanks Mike Dooley for this gift."
5,Infinite Possibilites,I really enjoyed this book and mike Dooley has done a great job on explaining the Law Of Attraction. I have been wanting to learn more about this subject and Mike dooley explains it so that even a child could understand it. I would certainly recommend this book to everyone who want to make their life better in every area.Ron Daack
5,A Comment,"Agreed this is first class Mac at their best before they became a factory pop band, but the previous review's song mentions do not match the titles on the spec listing. The CD cover art does not include ""Oh Well"" and ""Green Manalishi""-two superp must haves for Mac fans. I have the original LP issue on UK CBS and they are on the cover. Is there some error here? Has the original been reissued on CD minus those two towering tracks?"
1,Give me a break!,"Let's take lots of hormones so we can breast feed our baby hormones. Gee, that sounds like a great idea to me! Why must adoptive parents feel guilty about not breast feeding (or any mother for that matter). Are there serious, large, long term studies that show that breast fed babies are happier, healthier, thinner, smarter and richer than their bottle fed counterparts and is it the ONLY determining factor?"
3,Disappointed,"I purchased the Kindle edition of ""Summer Campaign"" by Carla Kelly, as the paperback copy I have is wearing out from repeated readings. I was very disappointed to find that the electronic version had been ""edited"". While the story and characters were basically the same, some of the dialogue had been altered. I will not be purchasing any more books handled by this publisher - censoring is not for adults."
4,Such a good read,"Jack Beresford, the hero returns from the war in Spain only wanting to go home. Onyx Hamilton is on her way to marry a prosy bore of a vicar. How they meet and learn got love each other is a delight.Carla Kelly has again written a story with people you would like to know."
2,FAST PACE EVEN FOR BEGINNERS!,It will take a lot of studying the tape to join in on the exercises because there are so many steps to remember and once it starts it is hard to keep up even for a beginner. Didn't enjoy.
1,Lemon aid jar,"The first time I filled the jar with liquid, the spigot broke. I would not buy this products."
4,"Unique, Strange, but Never Confusing., and Always Exciting","The Doom Patrol's old enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil, are gone. In their place stands the strange menace of the Brotherhood of Dada, and their painting that can consume cities. But the Brain, the former leader of the Brotherhood of Evil, is by no means done with the Doom Patrol.""Doom Patrol: The Painting that Ate Paris"" is the second collection of Grant Morrison's groundbreaking and fondly-remembered on ""Doom Patrol."" He kept the surreal tone coming, slowly and gradually pulling the team to new levels of strangeness.From a battle with the absurdly inventive Brotherhood of Dada to retrieve Paris from inside of a painting, to a concept of nothing that threatens to consume the world, Morrison tells unique, strange, exciting, but never-confusing stories that deserve their reputation and longevity. You can't go wrong with this volume."
5,FINALLY!!!,"I have waited years to read this book, years!!! Finally affordable for my tastes. And a Bolland cover to boot!"
5,perfect fire truck book for little ones,"I'm very surprised to see this not sold by Amazon.It's a wonderful book for very little kids because it is not scary at all. In fact, you hardly see any fire. Just cute animals who hang out at the fire house and keep having their spaghetti dinner interrupted by the alarm, and have to go fight fires. It's very cute and children love it!"
3,Review of cervical pillow,"This product worked great when initially purchased, however after about a month of use, it has lost its support and is very mushy. Would not buy again."
2,Lost support two months in,This was great while it lasted. Now my knees rub together as it's the foam has lost support so it's next to useless
2,won't buy it again,It is as hard as a rock. Maybe can be used for my back but certainly not for my neck
2,chewable,"I have a Welsh Corgi that seems to chew through every harness we have bought for her. Yep, this one lasted almost 30 minutes. If you have a dog that likes to chew I don't recommend this one. It is made well and looks nice but not worth the money when they only last a few minutes."
2,Parkinson's Law used book,"I wanted to replace a lost copy of Parkinson's Law. I selected a more expensive offer as it said it was in excellent condition. Actually I was surprised that I received a paperback (I thought for the price it would be a hard cover) and it was in good, not excellent condition."
2,"Method fantastic, book not so great","I just bought a Montessori prescchool & kindergarten and changed the name. I use 'Montessori tools,' yet I feel there are more 'updated' tools to use as well. After reading this book and other materials about Montessori, I feel that the Montessori way of teaching as a foundation is fantastic, but there are so many 'updated' ways to enhance the Montessori Method. I got 'lost' several times reading this book, particularly the first half of the book. I just think, like most information out there, some of the material is worth using."
2,On Demand reprint not good enough,I ordered the book for a gift after seeing the cover page - but was not satisfied with the book. The print was too large and some diagrams were missing.
1,Important Information regarding the Chalkboard Edition,"I have been working in and studying Montessori for nearly twenty years. I recently purchased a new copy of The Absorbent Mind, this one with the chalkboard on front. This book is incomplete (from missing pages to an entire chapter), does not use Dr. Montessori's words and on many occasions distorts the actual meaning of the concepts discussed. I would strongly recommend investing in a different version.The book Dr. Montessori wrote is a very different experience than this one represents. If you are interested in the book seek out a different edition consider one with a forward by John Chattin - McNicholes. The Absorbent Mind [ABSORBENT MIND] [Paperback]"
1,Unreadable edition of a classic text,"I returned this version (the print-on-demand version) because the translation was utterly unreadable and the design was atrocious. It read as if these ""publishers"" simply applied Google translate to Montessori's classic text, which is in public domain at this time, and fed it into a print on demand computer. Truly disappointing. Buy the real version. I wish Amazon would stop selling this version."
3,Economy Class Edition,"Comparing it to the 1995 First Owl Books Edition (Henry Holt), this 2009 BN Publishing edition presents itself rather poor and stripped down. The Edition Notice is minimal, doesn't even show the ISBN number or year of print. There is no foreword, no identification of the translator, let alone a Translator's Note. The body matter itself is abbreviated. I was so disappointed that I disconsidered this new purchase and ordered another copy of the 1995 edition from a used book seller."
2,"Great book, buy it from a different publisher!","I bought this book, and started the training to become a Montessori Certified educator, and realized this book from this particular publisher was missing many of the VITAL charts and illustrations that Maria Montessori originally included! I was VERY disappointed that they would leave something like this out of the book.Lesson learned, I will not buy books from BN publishing ever again!It is a wonderful book, and very educational, but look for a different publisher so that you can get the COMPLETE version."
2,Do not buy the BN (chalkboard) edition!,"The BN edition with the chalkboard on the cover is missing charts and whole sections of chapters. I examined the book side-by-side with another edition of the book (the Holt edition, with the close-up of a child on the cover) and it was extremely difficult even to figure out how the chapters match up. This is a very poorly edited book that is not worth your time to read! The Absorbent Mind is a wonderful book, full of insights about early childhood development that are very relevant even today.... just don't rely on the BN edition for an accurate version of the text."
3,Shorter than older version,"As another reviewer mentioned, these are short and thus do not offer much wrist protection. They are very good for handling heavy Lodge cast iron, since the bumps and surface of the silicon do not allow the cast iron to slide easily. I have the older, longer version too, and much prefer it."
1,Geochemisrty of Hydrothermal Ore Deposits 3rd Adition,"Purchase the Geochemisrty of Hydrothermal Ore Deposits 3rd Adition, from Amazon web site. No third party. Book was $240, however print quality is very poor. Has a copy been done?"
4,A Great Read,"I liked this book. Miniter describes in detail all of Bin Laden's attacks throuth the 90s. It has the best description of each attack that I have seen in print. He points out mistakes that the Clinton team made along the way, but the book is not some partisan attack on Clinton. It is not as harsh on him as you would think from the title.Miniter has great sources in the Sudan and writes in depth on the Sudanese relationship with the US and Bin Laden. Richard Clarke, who has been one of the biggest critics of the president, comes off as some who was deeply concerned about terrorism and did everything he could to protect America. James Woolsey was also a main source.This is one of the best books that I have read on Bin Laden and the terrorism issue. I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic"
1,Objective Writing,"It is interesting how the author conveniently claims with no proof (interesting pattern on his part) how negative reviewers are critical of this book without having read it. But if you refer to the only two reviews to appear in the objective press, the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, you will find they are at least as critical as anything that appears here. You don't need to trust me on this point. Go see for yourself at their sites.Regarding Clarke, the issue boils down to this. Do you believe the direct testimony, both written and oral in both the present and the soon-to-be-released past, of the man himself with a distinguished career spanning 4 Presidents? Or do you believe what the man said as interpreted by a biased, unknown author with a history of drifting from one right-wing think tank and publication to the next and hoping to raise his profile?"
1,I know one lie in this book,"The author claims ""How the Predator spy plane-which spotted bin Laden three times-was grounded by bureaucratic infighting.""I *work* on the Predator. It was never deployed anywhere near Afghanistan before 9-11.Heck the rest of the book could be true, but he lost me with something that I know is wrong. He shouldn't lie in public, because someone will always call you out. (In all fairness he could just have a bad source, but that doesn't improve his credibility by much.)"
4,"A stunning, awesome, well-reported book","Imagine what happens when a few good breaks and infinite shoe leather let you start interviewing members of the intelligence services of African, Middle Eastern, and some European countries, and they let you copy the files the CIA sent them, and they show you the files they sent the CIA, and the same disastrous patterns of cluelessness and incompetence by the architects of American foreign policy show up again and again. The foreigners agree to talk because they are as dumfounded as you are. Then, more amazingly, the key players in Washington confirm everything themselves in on-record interviews. This meticulously researched, amply documented, and tightly written account of 12 botched opportunities to stop bin Laden is must reading for all Americans."
2,An oddly disturbing effect.,"Reading this book left me with 3 distinct impressions:1) The author is not great at the craft of writing, but this isn't of prime importance in a research text. It just makes it unpleasant to read.2) There is a lot of musing about what Clinton might have been thinking at various times. This is exceptionally vague and unsupportable for a history/research book and it sometimes wanders into the realm of Monica Lewinski fantasy, but only lightly.3) The author seems to be giving offhanded slams to Bush (W). He frequently refers to ineffective missile strikes on Bin Laden by Clinton with terms like ""empty gesture."" It happens enough that it seems to be alluding to Bush's frequent bombings of empty caves in Afghanistan and empty buildings in Iraq. It is confusing coming from a purportedly rightward leaner, and is a bit out of line to undermine a sitting president this way. It think he should save it for a later book."
1,Horrible Book,"Its obvious by reading the first chapter of this book that the author didn't do his research. Bill Clinton did more to fight terrrorism than any president before him, its just more propaganda trying to keep people from the truth."
1,Bush really lost Bin Laden,"Clintonfoiled at least a dozen known terrorist attacks;rolled up Al Qaeda cells in 20 countries;issued a pres. order tossassinate Bin Laden;struck him at every opportunityBushhad 3 actual verified opportuntites to get Bin Laden in early 2001, but let him get away;dismantled a 3-pronged force designed to get him;blocked investigations into all Saudis (15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis);ignored warnings from 10 different contries' intelligence agencies about 9/11;knew the who, how, probable where and approximate when of the 9/11 attacks, but did nothing.and since 9/11,has foiled no verified terrorist plots;enabled terrorists to get their hands on 'dirty bomb' materials (in this case, nuclear waste) which was stored in Iraq);and enabled Al Qaeda to spread to five MORE countries.So who should this book _reaaly have been about?"
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm sorry I wasted my time reading this book. Instead of a thoughtful review of Clinton's decisions and the impact of those decisions, its another bald faced attempt to blame Clinton regardless of what the facts actually show. Read this book if you hate Clinton and are looking for fuel for the fires of your hate. Avoid this book if you are capable of independent, critical, and non-partisan thought."
2,"No one man, no one party. Shameful politcs here, really.","The problem with the basic premise of this book is George Bush was president for 8 months before 9-11. If it so crystal clear to blame Clinton, why weren't matters addressed with the new administration? Further, if UBL were such an easy target why hasn't W nabbed him in the last 2 years? Answer: Because it wasn't easy then, and it ain't easy now.As 'don't bother me with the facts' becomes more and more the right's mantra, these authors should be ashamed of themselves for their expoliting the tragedy to further their agenda.No one man, no one party, is to be blamed for our nation's most tragic day. Hopefully, the grown-ups will retake the debate soon on both politcal sides and writers like this will be returned to the fringe where they belong."
5,The Truth = Something Bill Clinton Would Rather you not know,"A stunning account of the absolute lack of moral leadership and courage of a man who shamed the entire country while serving in the Office of the Presidency. Mr. Miniter goes into great detail and cites numerous parties, most from within the Clinton Administration, to feverishly drive home his point of how Bill Clinton's lack of any personal integrity to the Oath he swore to uphold, led to the deaths of thousands of Americans, here at home and around the globe. A must read for ALL Americans concerned about matters of national security and for ALL Americans with a desire to know the truth about what a man from Hope did to ruin the Oval Office."
1,For the Militia Crowd,"This book was obviously written to appeal to the furthest fringes of the paranoid right and in that respect it succeeds. If there was anything of substance in here, it surely would have been noticed by the national press. The fact that it has only caused a stir, and a minor one at that, amongst the extremist crowd limits the reach of this diatribe. Probably half the 5 star reviews on this board were supplied by colleagues of Miniter's like Stephen Pollard. This screed will soon slip into the oblivion it deserves with all the other baseless attack journalism on a President 3 years out of office."
1,If Arnie Were a Democrat......,"...do you think the Repugs would let him get away with, ""That was the '70s. I was never planning to run for governor.""Please.Look at the damage they did to the country over a sexual act between consenting adults, over ""I did not inhale...""The hypocrisy boggles the mind. And now this scurrilous book.Make no mistake, the people on this site giving this book high ratings are storm troopers for the neander-cons now running the country.God save the United States of America!"
1,"Full of errors, full of holes","Another moronic doorstop from the rabid Clinton haters.Errors both factual and logical pepper this useless addition to any recycle pile. Easier to blame Clinton than fully (or even generally) understand terrorism, Bin Laden, or the wider Middle East.A must throw out.D.A., NYC"
1,This book is horrible.,"I thought this would be a good book, but it is based on lies and distortions and glosses over important details. It is a biased book by an extremist right winger, not an objective look at the facts. It fails on all levels."
1,Could this be a paid political ad in disguise of a book?,"Obviously written by a biased, untrained researcher with a blatant disregard for integrity in journalism. Blames everything under the sun on Clinton, while ignoring Bush, Sr.'s prior adminstration's failings and tie-ins, and conveniently fails to mention, four years and hundreds of billions of dollars later, the utter failure of the current Bush administration to bring Bin Laden to justice even now! It was a waste of my time! BTW, the unabridged MP3 CD version is narrated as if the fellow wants a shot at Rush Limbaugh's job... skip it and keep looking for a real history tome on the subject!"
1,Book is Written By A Moron,"Poorly written. I want my money back! The editing job is terrible, the book is poorly written and I am pretty sure the author might have an IQ that is below average. I consider myself a foreign policy buff and this book is definitely written by a moron."
2,More Right Wing Hypocrisy,"If only President Clinton had invaded Iraq,tortured the usual suspects, tapped our phones and gone trillions of dollars in debt!Miniter followed this hit piece with a book telling the untold story of how the Bush administration is winning the war on terror. Mission accomplished!"
1,Bush provides rebuttal to this book,"Q: Mr. President, in your speeches now, you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that? [...]BUSH: ... I don't know where he is. Nor -- you know, I just don't spend that much time on him really, to be honest with you [...]Q: Do you believe the threat that bin Laden posed won't truly be eliminated until he is found either dead of alive?BUSH: As I say, we hadn't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure. And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.I'll repeat what I said: I truly am not that concerned about him.-President George W. Bush, March 13, 2003"
4,Liberals beware,"This book really takes it to the left wing, specifically the pacifist. Year by year of the Clinton Admin. and the countless opportunity to kill bin Laden. The book is entertaining when you read about the incompetence of the admin, will anger you when you read how they drug their feet in making a decision, and annoy you with all of the non-Christian names."
1,Sad,"What a load of tasteless papp!To blame Clinton's administration for what happened in 2001 is pathetic. Sure, more could have been done in avoiding this catastrophy during Clinton's and the Bushes' time, but it's all very easy to point fingers in hindsight.Maybe the author needs to address this current foreign policy and where it is going wrong still. When an attack happens again perhaps he can write another book only swapping 'Clinton' for 'Bush' hmmmm?"
1,Do we believe the Sudanese or the Americans?,"In a desparate attempt to avoid pinning the blame for 9/11 on George ""Dubya"" Bush, the author has decided to resort to the tactics of the loony fringe Jerry Falwell right and blame Clinton. And what he has done is simply patch together some crackpot testimonies from other journalists looking to settle scores. The book is going to be syndicated in Reverend Moon's paper, The Washington Times. It has also featured on the far right website, the Drudge Report, which is also linked to Reverend Moon. Obviously, the Moonies like the author.He has made elaborate conjectures to prove many of his points. Miniter relies heavily on Sudanese intelligence to back up his theories, and we all know how reliable the Sudanese spooks are. The truth is that the last thing that Republicans would want to do is assign blame to the person who was actually responsible - our present incumbent, Mr. George Walker Bush."
4,So much for Clarke,"If we're looking for the truth, I'd go with this book before Clarke's:Via the Washington Times:""The final policy paper on national security that President Clinton submitted to Congress - 45,000 words long - makes no mention of al Qaeda and refers to Osama bin Laden by name just four times.""""...undercut claims by former White House terrorism analyst Richard A. Clarke that the Clinton administration considered al Qaeda an ""urgent"" threat, while President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, ""ignored"" it.""Add to that Clarke's assertion that Rice knew nothing of Al Qaeda until he told her, in spite of the fact she is on record in an interview a full year before he told her anything, speaking at length on the Al Qaeda problem, and Mr. Clarke becomes an unbelievable opportunist.Surely Mr. Miniter's book has a few partisan moments, also, but nothing that has been so definitively proven false as has been Clarke's political hack job."
1,not Richard Clarke,"Well well well, look what we have here,The one person who had a bird's eye view of what the US Government (in both administrations) actually did (as opposed to the made up 'facts' in Miniter's book) has testified under oath and written a book and he has something different to say. While Clarke is critical of Clinton, he notes ""the new administration really thought Clinton's recommendation that eliminating al-Qaida be one of their highest priorities, well, rather odd, like so many of the Clinton administration's actions, from their perspective"".As for the conservatives, 'facts' in their definition are not the same thing as in the dictionary definition where it means something that is true."
3,Revlon Toenail Clipper,"This toenail clipper is easy to handle and it's a good size. The drawback is that it's not very sharp at all.It works no better than adequately for me, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has thick or ""problem"" toenails."
5,"AWESOME BAND, AWESOME CD!","THIS BAND IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS CD RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The song, ""Rock The Area,"" is the greatest!!!!!YAAAAAAAAAAAAYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Hackett does the Blues,"Steve Hackett show his talent and ability with this CD. He was a experianced Harp player before he joined Genesis, and He showcases his ability here with this CD.The Title track is a wonderful sonic experiance, soulful guitar, blistering Harp and Steve's vastly improving vocals. If you like Blues, like Gary Moore and Snowy White add this to you collection..."
1,Worst handling of any race game,"Just like my review of the other codemaster game Tocca Race 3, I'm wondering what people are using and what settings, because nothing seems to get this game to simulate any normal car movements or steering. Both games by codemaster has no value on my computer with my wheel even though my system is much higher then the stated requirements.You'd be taking a risk buying this game not knowing if it will work or not and many write ups stated they also couldn't get a normal steering or handling out of this game making it worthless to them as well.This had worse handling and issues setting steering then the game 'Driver' so you can imagine."
3,Good old game,"It was pretty good @ that time, really good concept of what a rally race is, good graphics and play modes but the menu is very poor... In general a good game 2 have fun 4 a while."
4,Product great for 8 year old grandson!,The telescope was great for my grandson. The instructions to assemble it were a little complicated. My biggest disappointment was the shipping! The tape was coming off and the box had a hole in it. I am glad all the parts were there!!! The only packing on the inside was a little crumpled paper. But no broken parts!
4,Great for beginner!!,Bought this for my dad who lives on the water. He uses it to look at boats that pass by his home. He is very happy with it and says that it was easy to assemble and is easy to use.
4,Don't know yet,"This seems like a great product. Everything is of good quality, but either I'm stupid or you have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to run it. Don't know how to line up the red light that it talks about. I can't even see anything through it - maybe I'm not looking in the right place???? My husband says we'll figure it out. it will be a good lifetime gift."
4,telescope,"We bought this for our granddaughter, she will have alot of fun with it in the future, good starter telescope."
3,"Only usable in forrest/desert/mountain areas, no city lights.","As a general rule these telescopes only work well in dark areas with no ""light pollution"". This particular telescope is not bad quality for the price, but I'm just not sure what you can even do with it. Unless you frequently go camping to areas that are dim and sparsley populated, this is really of no use other than to look at it."
3,Not as powerful as expected.,"Guess I was expecting more. You can see the moon better than with the naked eye, but you still can't see much. If I knew where Saturn was I'd see if I can see the rings, as advertised. It is good for looking at birds in your backyard though."
3,kinda disappointed.,"hard to see anything in good detail. it was a birthday gift for an eight year old, so we didn't want to get anything too expensive. he might accidentally break it in the near future. kids,what are you gonna do? that said, it is not the greatest telescope."

(From another's review): Chapters: 1: The Evolutionary Course of Work Through Human History; 2: The Relationship Between Man and Work; 3: The Explanation of the Quran; 4: Work in Iran (A case study)."
4,Boris Rises Again!,"THE GHOUL is a good little story about an egyptologist (Karloff) who wants to live forever. He believes he can achieve immortality by having a sacred jewel placed in the hand of Anubis (he has the statue in his bedroom) after his demise. Unfortunately, several others want the precious gem for themselves! Treachery abounds until Boris rises from his grave. He is NOT happy to find his jewel missing! THE GHOUL is creepy enough to overcome some of it's dull moments. Check out (sirs) Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson in early roles! Richardson plays a preacher who just might be a bit too ""good"". This is a great movie for all Karloff fans..."
3,A golden oldie,"Worth a look this movie, not my favourite Boris Karloff film by any means and not my favourite 1930's horror film. Having said that it would make it into my top 15 1930's horror film list if I made one! A small role for Boris but a good performance none the less. I got it for a bargain price of 1.50 this dvd and I have to say that the transfer is wonderful for such an old movie, extras are few but the film is what counts. 3 and a half stars is my true score for this small gem. Ernest Thesiger puts in a good perfomance also, not as good as he did in The Bride Of Frankenstein though."
2,"SLOW, MOODY, ATMOSPHERIC","THE GHOUL (MGM) is about a dying profesor (Boris Karloff) who has a gemstone called ""The Eternal Light"" that was looted from an Egyptian tomb. He believes the god Anubis will grant immortality through the jewel and makes his servant promise to bind the gem in his hand when he dies. ""If it's stolen, I'll return from the dead and seek revenge."" Naturally, the servant steals the stone. You get the idea. The 1933 UK film features a young Ralph Richardson. Slowly paced with moody cinematography."
2,Dead on Arrival,"I've tried watching this movie over the years and found it boring,cold and so confusing that I could never understand what was happening. With this new DVD, I decided to give it another chance. Verdict: it's just as boring, cold and confusing as before. Technically, it looks great. Wonderful shadows and lighting. But this film moves soooooo slow. And poor Boris Karloff. He does what he can in the role of the glaring, stumbling old ghoul but he acts embarassed by the whole stunt. Great Britian simply didn't have the know-how in the early thirties to make a great horror flick like those being turned out by Universal. Don't waste your time on this one. Watch the l932 ""The Mummy"" instead to see how a real classic looks."
3,Odd...,"The DVD is good, picture and sound are quite clear...The movie itself, though, is bizarre. It starts out in a fashion that is spooky and one is truly led to believe that something mysterious is going to unfold throughout the picture. It might surprise one to learn that by the picture's end what has developed more strongly than a thriller is a romantic comedy/love story. Karloff is okay, but man he's just not on screen long enough. A few good scenes, but the picture changes its mind in midstream, loses the horror idea for one of levity and chase sequences, and ends with a man carrying a woman in his arms (with Karloff seemingly dead). So, in sum, not a bad picture per se, but definitely NOT what a horror fan would expect!"
4,A rare gem beautifully restored,"This is a hard-to-find Karloff film, done in England. It's very atmospheric and it has some fascinating characters, not the least of which is that hoot of an old queen, Ernest Thesiger, in one of the meatiest roles he's done since THE OLD DARK HOUSE. The restoration is wonderful."
4,The Eternal Light,"A jewel (The Eternal Light) comes into the possession of Professor Morlant (Boris Karloff). The jewel is supposed to have the powers of the ancient Egyptian gods, in which Morlant believes will give him immortality. On Morlant deathbed he instructs his servant, Laing to bind the jewel in his hand and he warns Laing if the jewel is stolen, he will rise from the dead and hunt for revenge. Laing steals the jewel. After Morlant death, he arises from the dead and discovers the jewel has been stolen and then goes looking for it.The makeup is effective and Boris does appear to resemble something more dead than alive.The Ghoul was Boris Karloff's first British produced file and England's first major effort to capitalize in on horror films."
1,The Ghoul a 1933 film with Boris Karloff,"The quality of the video was lousy,extremely dark you barely see it. Granted it is a very old British film (33) .Fuzzy and bad ! The plot was really terrible too. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. ."
2,Not for the beginner or intermediate programmer,"There is absolutely no PHP or My-Sql teaching in this book. If your looking to see how a professional group of programmers use functions and how they outline their sites then this book is for you. BUT if you're looking for a book to learn any PHP My-Sql programming, don't buy this book. But if you do buy it, buy it used... It's not worth the new book price."
5,Embodiment of a real-world app,"A book like this was long awaited. There is no better way to learn than the method this book enunciates - the construction of each module that makes up a web site is clearly described through each of its chapters. It was also refreshing to see that the application that was implemented in the book is available online - forums,newsgroups, news feeds, message boards, complete shopping cart with check out features, and a very neatly written final chapter that takes a look at what could have been done better - refactoring, templating etc along with a fullish perspective of the whole application.Kudos to the author team, for a job well done. I recommend this book to any programmer that wants to learn PHP, use PHP better (thru an OO approach) and build an effective and useful web site."
2,"Its a good book, but....","The book is great. It comes with layouts of code on how to do pages like forums, creating ads, and taking polls. The only problem I had was using PEAR DB. As far as I know Pear is relatively new and it was way too hard to try and figure out how to incorporate that into my Database. I was using MySQL on CRUX, and for me it was difficult to figure out. They also use a lot of require_once lines. I know what they are used for, but the code was so long that for one page they used require_once for multiple different pages. I think for a beginner, this book is not the way to go. For people who have no dea what PEAR is or how to set it up, this book Not the way to go. If your experienced somewhat in PHP and know Pear, knock yourself out!For me, the book was too advanced, I have done some web sites in PHP but not at this level. Hope I helped some people with their decision."

We all frequently visit Hawaii but usually do not take the time to understand anything about the islands beyond the beautiful beaches. This is our book to learn and understand what this culture is really about. Easy to read. A must!

4,Wonderful Debut,"This book is a great read for someone who loves paranormal. Although, the historical part could of been researched a bit better, the rest is totally believable. The author has a wonderful imagination and creative use of language. I am sure that Ms. Haytko's next book will be even better. Good Luck"
3,Okay Vampire Story,"The story was okay. There were a lot of editorial mistakes, stff that had she proofread might not have happened. Other than that, and the historical errors, the books story was okay. I have read better and I have read worse. On a positive note, I found the characters captivating and look forward to their development as the series continues."
1,Laurell K Hamilton rip off,"I was excited to get this book, as all the reviews on this site were pretty good. But it was a huge waste of money. This is a complete rip off of the Anita Blake series. The woman is a detective/Vampire hunter, vampires are citizens, there's a triangle between Kae and her boyfriend and the ""Prince of the City"" (Master of the city ripoff). I was so disgusted that I quit reading it after chapter 3. Don't bother with this book, all the Anita Blake books are so much better and 1/2 the price."
1,Stefanie Powers and Maureen Stapleton are not in this movie!,"There are 2 movies (for all I know maybe 3) As you can see there is no information on who the actors are. And there is no way of finding out. Only the hard way, like BUY IT! The actors (on the one I purchased) Turned out to be Angela Jones, Pamela Bellwood, Tim Redwine, Kathy Garver and Edward Bunker. Actors I have no interest in.Stefanie Powers and Maureen Stapleton are not in this movie. If you take the chance of buying it and it is not the movie you want, You may not get a full refund, or any refund at all for that matter. So don't learn the hard way as I did. I purchased a DVD through Caiman.com and now I deeply regret it. This is my opinion!"
1,Don't like it,"I have it, but rarely use it, as it reminds me of a bug spray. I prefer Estee Lauder's Pleasures for Men. [...]"
1,horrible scent,"what a rip off...they wont even accept returns. Used to have one before and I remember it smelling nice. The one I got in the mail is terrible, almost unusable."
2,Not worth the money,"I ordered this cabinet for extra space in my bathroom. I have put together several storage pieces from other companies (Sauder, ClosetMaid, etc.) Based on the price of this item, I expected about the same or better quality. What a disappointment! This was by far the most difficult to assemble. The directions were next to useless, the pieces did not line up and the cam bolts holding them together were very low quality. I finally got the whole thing together with the help of my husband and his tablesaw. The end product is just okay--I give it 2 stars only because when I outfitted with with some high quality pieces from Pottery Barn, it didn't look half bad."
4,A smile for your face,I saw this movie on Toon Disney with my little brother and got wrapped up fairly quickly in it. I really enoyed the story and music that went along with it. The message seemed to hold a pretty true meaning and I was quite impressed with it.
4,Good and Angry: Exchanging Frustration for Character in You,I feel this book has really helped me get a handle on my anger and my families anger in our every day lives. I feel the religious base helps me apply the teachings to help my children growup to be well ajusted and sucessful adults.
1,For the Love of God,"If you're a heavy-duty Christian, you may love this book. But I couldn't make it through the first chapter because of wading through so much religion. I've read many parenting books by Christian authors before and found some of them helpful after I waded through the religious references, but this book is ALL religious references. I threw mine in the garbage."
5,Love this!,"I use this spritzer at night on my face before bed and under my moisturizer. It feels good, calms my skin and my mood."
2,Best of Times,"The movie centers around Robin Williams, who dropped a ball in a football game some years ago, and cannot get over it. He tries to reunite the team to relive the game and finally catch the ball that he missed. I did like Russell's performance but Williams was just out of place. Really, Robin Williams playing football? There was alot of storyline errors that never added up and the ending could be seen from the opening narration. Long, not very funny, and just plain dull."
3,Robin and Kurt Unusual in this 80's Cult Classic,"Robin Williams and Kurt Russell give a performance different from their norm. I have never liked Robin or Kurt that much, but I liked this film because it is likeable, minus all the profanity and other tactless nonsense included in this film. The storyline was the most acceptable part. I purchased this DVD about a year ago, and as soon as I finished watching this film, two things occurred to me. A) This film does present itself in an oddly, almost irreverently comedic tone and B)The Best of Times, though certainly interesting, should not have recieved the acclaim that many people gave it. It was never a critics choice, however, and rightly not, because it is at best a B- kind of thing. It is, however, worth checking out because it's a Sunday night classic.BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste 2 hours on it if you hate small towns, football, a combination of the two, or bad acting by no-names included in the less than all-star back cast."
3,The Best of Times.,I saw this on netflix because I Am a Fan of Robin Williams' Work and he gives a great performance.Sometimes the delivery is slow and the movie can be quite depressing but overall a fun flick and good sports movie.It should have been funnier given that Robin Williams has immense talent and that he co-stars with Kurt Russell in this but I was disappointed.
3,Kirk Cameron?? Really??,"Robin Williams is as good as ever in this film, and Russell is very credible in his role. However, Kirk Cameron seems to be a needless prop in this movie. Maybe he should have stayed with his Family Ties gig a little longer and spared moviegoers the task of watching him ruin good entertainment with his very limited range of acting skills. I considered most of the film entertaining, despite its derivative plot concept, but it would have been MUCH better without the Cameron digression. That is why I can only rate this film ""okay."""
1,Bad attempt to confuse the students,"There were no spreadsheet applications, no calculator applications and no solutions manual for the student.The book reads dry and you need a highlighter to hunt out what the authors are trying to tell you...Bad book , waste of money."
1,not a good textbook :(,"this book wastes alot of pages just for margin. not an easy to read book. the whole semester, we only covered 5 chaps, alot of material is not useful for undergraduates."
5,2 types of readers,"From the reviews posted here, it's clear we have 2 types of reviewers: disgruntled undergrads and pompous grad students (probably at the MBA level from the looks of it).Let's be honest.This is a challenging book.If you are serious about finance, the book will reward you many times over. That I can pretty much guarantee.If you are in finance as part of a cirriculum requirement, this book may become your nemesis.This author finds the book to be comprehensive."
1,"Weak, not relevant and dry","I have talked to many people that used this book and we all share the same experience: The book is dry, lacks practical examples, lacks spreadsheet applications and you almost have to sit with a marker and mark the most important concepts.It is not written with you in mind. It is written with how can I sell the Solutions manual to you and how can the professor trick you so that he looks like the big shot.""Essentials of Corporate Finance"" was a much better book by the same authors"
4,Great Binoculars,"These are excellent binocs for the price. Nice clear optics, rubberized barrels, good grip and easy focus. Perfect to carry along on hikes, bike trips, etc."
2,Barka Trend binoculars free with Leatherman,"The optics seem good for the price. Nice and clear. However there's a lot of play in the focus mechanism so the focus of the two eye pieces doesn't track. So I have to always focus moving the adjustment in the same direction. Or only look through one eye. I guess I can't complain too much considering what I paid (nothing).I find it amusing that they have a lifetime warranty. But if you need to take advantage of it, you must send the binoculars back freight prepaid, with a check for $20 to cover inspection,shipping and handling. That just happens to be their list price."
3,It is good if free,"I got this thing free for buying another leatherman tool.It works fine, with reasonable optical quality. Focus is adjustable, giving reasonable good image. The exit pupil is sort of too small - always with ""black circle"".It is good to get it free - if you are paying for it - that is a vivitar one for $1x.xx on amazon - that's the thing you want for this level binocular.Current I use a Canon IS 10x30 binocular, that's called a binocular but this is not."
4,Nice to hear these guys together.,"Charter members of the 1960's San Francisco music scene, this should catch the eye and ear of fans of that genre. There are reminders of each of the player's former groups. John Cipollina's Quicksilver guitar is present throughout the album, especially on 'Strange Way,' and 'Mona.' Country Joe's Barry Melton vocal and guitar drives 'Butcher's Boy' into the spotlight. Peter Albin's (Big Brother and the Holding Company) bass underpins it all. Merl Saunders big warm organ sound shows clearly on 'Do I Move You?' Jefferson Airplane drummer Spencer Dryden rocks steadily. 'Lay Back Baby' gives a nod to the Dead 80's sound. There are several stellar moments, but absolutely not groundbreaking or mind numbing. Still, its good to hear this guys making music together again."
2,There's a reason they're extinct,"Though there's a lot of individual talent here, it doesn't add up to much. The production is thin, the vocals are strained and the songwriting is weak. Seek out these dinosaurs in their former individual incarnations before they ""evolved"" to create this poor material."
4,fair pair of speakers.,"I have it for 3 months and it works fine, it is reasonable for its low price. Don't expect any sound quality here, if you use it only for listening to radio that's okay.(I use it for my ps2 and radio only) I would pay a little more for the logitechs. *I brought these Logitech X-230 SPKRS 2.1*"
4,needs more monster trucks,This is a good movie but they added too many jokes such as monster truck tag and a mud ball fight. They also added many other sports like off roading motorcros mudding and mini monster trucks. In the end there is crushing mud bogging and racing with trucks like bigfoot Gravedigger snakebite and jersey outlaw. Needs more monster trucks.
5,"Your child will love all of the ""there goes a"" series.",Attention keeper and very educational. My two year old can tell you all about the monster truck and how it works. Well worth money.
3,Disappointing - Dave has done better elsewhere,Dave Hood has let the clowning around get in the way of the real stars of this video - the trucks themselves. It's tolerable if you skip past the worst of the clowning - the ridiculous side-story that involves Dave and Becky abandoning the Big Dummy truck in the desert. But this video compares poorly with the the two others in the series we have (fire truck and train) where the clowning can help to teach about the subjects.
5,Great For young kids,The Grand kids loved the entire series of There goes a truck. The boys watched the series over and over.They learned so much about how real trucks work. They rate an A grade. I hope they are now made in DVDs.
1,Little redeeming value,"My 20-month-old is a big fan of the There Goes a . . . series, and I've become one with him. This video, however, falls far short of the others. It's incredibly annoying and has none of the educational value of the others in the series."
1,Would not recommend,"This is the first ""There Goes A"" video we've purchased. We found the hosts, Dave and Becky, to be kind of stomach churning and idiotic. I do not want my 2 1/2 year old son to think that this is a cool way for people to act and interact. We think it's great that he loves monster trucks but we don't want him to emulate the behavior of Dave and Becky. We will take this one off our video shelf and find another that shows more actual footage which is the real reason we wanted a monster truck video for our son."
3,"Great video, Bad Manners","My boys LOVE this video. My only complaint is that on several occasions ""Dave"" pushes, smacks or yells at ""Becky"" in frustration. Even in play, this is inappropriate. This video is aimed at boys. They didn't need to add these little tiffs. It only detracts from an otherwise great video."
2,Where Are The Monster Trucks???,"My son LOVES all trucks, machines, trains, etc. There Goes A Firetruck is great, you actually learn about and see firetrucks. We thought There Goes A Monster Truck would be similar...WRONG. The movie has a goofy story line and TOO much Dave and Becky...they even have an arguement! This is a good video to borrow or rent - but I don't suggest buying it."
4,Just like I remember,I read this book when it first came out and it's just as wild as I remembered! Wonderful! Thanks for having it available.
2,Everything can be eaten,"I was very excited to buy this product as my two boys (21 months) have eaten every crayon they have ever gotten their hands on. When these crayons arrived I thought they looked really sturdy and could see why they may be too big for little mouths. I was wrong, although the base of the crayon is quite thick the top part is not and it took them all of 2 minutes for them to bite the tops off."
4,"Fun, easy-to-hold crayons","My son has had a great time with these crayons. I love how sturdy they are, compared to regular crayons which my son easily breaks. And my son loves putting them on his fingers, as well as stacking them into ""towers"" when he's coloring. They are a lot of fun!"
4,1yr old crayons,"Purchased for my 1yr's bday. He LOVES these crayons...ok, so there may not be A LOT of doodling going on at this age :) However, the shape is great for his little hands and he loves to stack one onto another (a bonus for motor skills). I show him how to doodle with them and he gets all excited and does a little scribbling. Think they are great to get the concept of creative play & coloring going without a big name label. If they are used alot, and there's not much left, melt them down and make one big multi colored crayon! Great cost, great buy."
4,good for beginning to color,"My granddaughter liked it better than the 'Star Crayon in the Tub."" It's basically stiff wax in an easy shape for a toddler to hold."
3,Ok for older toddlers,"Got theese for my 18 month old twins. They seemed ok at first, the color came off easily onto paper. They enjoyed stacking them. But, one little bite on the tip caused each crayon to crumble, and then they weren't fun anymore. I wish the pointed tip was a little thicker and stronger for curious biters! These eventually ended up in my 4 yr old's crayon collection. These are a good idea for kids who are over the mouthing stage."
1,Its a very poor charger. It didn't work very well at all.,"This product didn't work very well. Sometimes it didn't even charge my IPOD. My IPOD said it was full with battery after disconnecting it. 15 minutes later, my IPOD battery meter would say that the battery is about to die. This product may be cheap but whats the point when it doesnt work. I should sent it back to get my money. Since it wasn't expensive, I let it go. Don't buy this product."
2,it quit working by the 3rd use,"this charger cord no longer functions...i used it 3 times, and it's broken now...hey- i DID get my money's worth though- when i bought it it was 76 cents ...can't really complain about that....you're much better off going with Griffin or Belkin though...."
4,Pretty cool CD,"I bought this CD because I heard ""Possum Kingdom"" on the radio and thought it was great! I like the rest of the CD, but it kinda all sounds the same. I think they still have a good sound, and ""Possum Kingdom"" has got to be the coolest song!"
5,The good old days are still here.,"I clearly remember when I first heard the Toadies. A walkman radio. Laying on my bed. 5th grade. The song, Tyler. Yes folks, I think we all have fond memories like that of the Toadies. Since then, I've loved this album. If you dont know this band, you are not to be blamed. Unfortunately, they aren't a staple around the country. But they stay alive because of people like you and me."
4,pretty good...,"although it's not the most original thing in the world (pixies, anyone?), they do work good with their sound and have delivered an album that doesn't suck..."
5,Best CD Ever,"I saw the Toadies back in 1995 here in San Antonio when i was 13 years old. They impressed me then, and 8 years later they still impress me. I own any and every Toadies CD there is, be it a bootleg or one that was released. I must say, Rubberneck is definitely their best effort. Every song on this cd is good and you can listen to it for days at a time. I Burn is my personal favorite."
5,Timeless: A masterpiece,"There are few albums that have as much staying power as Rubberneck. Ever since it came out this Cd still recieves regular rotation on my car or stereo...not many albums can do that. Others with this much staying power for me include Rotting Pinata from Sponge, AEnima from Tool, and Youthanasia from Megadeth."
4,Genius Overlooked,"In college, this was me and my crew's staple. We first found them through a friend who had seen them play small clubs in the Texas scene. Eventually we watched as they became minor Buzz band stars thanks to MTV and the ""alternative"" movement of the early 90's. The band simply rocks. They write great lyrics, which range from creepy story telling, to introspective, hurt looks at lost faith. Todd Lewis' voice has a desperate urgency that keeps you holding on for more. This album will stand the test of time. It was without a doubt one of the best of the 90's. And if you ever had the chance to see them live, you experinced the energy, talent and realness that made them a fan favorite. Rest in peace Toadies."
3,A true slice of heavy metal.,"The Toadies crank it up with Mexican Hairless and for the next 35 minutes blow your speakers out. These guys rock. If you like loud albums, you might want to rank it a four or five star album. If you are looking for something to listen to, this is not pleasant. But, it is not a bad album. Possum Kingdom, Tyler and I Come From The Water are very good songs. The rest of the albu, unfortunately, sounds like the above mentioned songs. Still, it can be a heavy metal lovers dream."
3,decent...,"this album initially really impressed me, but then I started listening to the Pixies. yes, this does sound a bit like a pixies ripoff, but unlike a lot of other pixies ripoff bands, they manage to pull it off at least musically. I think the strongest example of this is that ""Tyler"" is a very blatant rip-off of the pixies' ""where is my mind?"", so much so that some less knowledgebale toadies fans who heard said pixies song at the end of Fight Club and thought it was a ripoff of the toadies. Although they pull off the sound well, lyrics are another story. Although ""possum kingdom"" and some other songs have good lyrics, the heaviest songs like ""mr. happy face"" and ""velvet"" are just mindless and repetative generic hate rants. Surfer Rosa is a better ""tough guys' pixies"" album recorded by the real thing. -1 point for lack of originality, - another for lyrics."
3,Classic jukebox single on a sub-par album,"Anyone who has grown up in the 90s or has been to a bar with a moderate 90s jukebox has heard the Toadies. Ask most of them who they are however, and you'll have a much tougher time finding anyone who knows the band by name.Getting to the point: Possum Kingdom is the only reason to really buy or download this album. Its a great single with a dark but good story complimented by music with plenty of hooks. Unfortunately for the album the hooks start and end there. The rest of the songs have very basic and predicable chord progressions that really don't lend anything to the somewhat monotone lyrics.I bought this album hoping to find another 90s gem like I did with the Screaming Trees a few years back but I can only report back unsatisfied.Download Possum Kingdom and leave it at that."
3,No one will ever see this review.,"Possum Kingdom. Who knows that name?[Silence]Who has heard that one song that goes ""Behind the boathouse I'll show you my dark secret...I'm not gonna lie...I will treat you well my sweet angel so help me Jesus..."" Yeah, me too.Too bad no one knows who this band is by name but everybody knows them by heart.Too bad no one will see this review; I wanted some more unhelpful ratings."
4,Quality Freestlye!,"""In a dream"" is one of the best freestyle dance songs I have ever heard. This album has several upbeat dance songs, along with a few slower songs as well. Brings back great memories!"
1,Can't we try....to ignore her?,"She totally butchered a beautiful Vonda Shepard/Dan Hill song! What a disgrace! If you want to hear ""Can't We Try"" the way it was intended to be heard, check out:Dan HillTo a die-hard Vonda Shepard fan like me, Rockell's version is like sacriledge! I know I'm going to get lots of angry comments from Rockell fans, but whatever."
4,da top,What are you looking at? Rockell's debut CD is da bomb and Rockell is fine. I hope she's making her 2nd album soon.
5,R&B at its best,"There are far too many people out there who think Blackstreet's only song (and first song, to boot) was ""No Diggity"". While it's undoubtedly a great song, the fact of the matter is, Blackstreet had a whole album on the market before ""No Diggity"" ever hit the charts. The first Blackstreet song I ever heard was the excellent ""Love's in Need"" and on the strength of that, I bought this album. Even after all these years, it's still the best R&B album I've ever listened to in my life. You just can't help but dance to tracks like ""U Blow my mind"", ""Baby Be Mine"" and ""Bootie Call"".I actually bought this album in Ireland several years ago, but unfortunately I lent it to someone and never got it back. However, I couldn't possibly live without this classic CD, which is why I've just ordered it from Amazon again. Yes, this album is so good that I'm willing to pay for it twice! Buy it, now."
5,A classic and timeless album - must have!,"I love all songs on this album, even the intro! This is just a perfect blend of funk, 90's R&B, new jack swing, smooth ballads and hip hop beats. This is Teddy Riley at his best (except guy's ""the future"")."
4,A slice of R&B thrown in with a bit of hip hop,"Blackstreet debut disc featured the hit Booti Call but it was the slow jam Before I Let You Go which pushed the group into the forefront. Dave Holister's on Before I Let You Go grab as soon as the first instrument is heard on the song. The other stand out slow cuts on the disc include Joy,Tonight's The Night and the sensual I Wanna Make Love."
4,excellent,"If only music had stayed like this... botie call ,baby be mine , and u blow my mind some of the funkiest music beforE I let u go....nice slow song there best album."
3,"Buy just for ""Before I Let You Go""","Blackstreet, a makeshift new R&B; group made up of some of the broken pieces of Teddy Riley & early '90s group Guy, hadn't really established a unique, indistinctive and signature sound on this 1994 debut.It's not a bad album, just not distinctive R&B.;Cop their sophomore set, ""Another Level"" (1996) first (That was the blockbuster!!!!). Then if you're curious what their debut LP was like, get this one."
3,An important work,"This documentary of the life of Florida's sugarcane workers should be required reading for every legislator voting on the sugar industry's subsidies, every citizen living in the State of Florida, and every person who consumes sugar in the U.S. As the book is focused social ills, it subsequently fails to adequately address the issue of the crop's environmental damage; and while it is a bit dated, it is yet a compelling look at the darker side of sugar."
5,A rare thing,"This is something rare, a funny, contemporary easy reader with a clever plot, kid-friendly humor, and natural-sounding writing. (Most easy readers have three-word sentences and go chop-chop.) You don't have to like bugs to like it, but it doesn't hurt. Great for a parent and child to read aloud together, which is what I did with my 7-year-old."
4,Good Book,Breakout at the Bug Lab is a good story for young readers. It will build up their creativity and teach them a lesson. The lesson will teach children to make sure they finish a task completely before they walk away and something bad happens. I thought that the book was very interesting and fun to read because it is a story full of waiting for something to happen and I think that that is a very good attention getter. The book was so interesting that I was waiting anxiously to read the second chapter. It was very descriptive and specific that I knew exactly what the writer was talking about. It was very colorful and had very good drawings.It is a very good book and I think that children and adults would love reading it. It has a lot of beautiful coloring and it would be a very interesting book to read
2,Are we talking about the same book?,"""Exploding is populated by music stars like Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Lil' Kim, Dr. Dre, the Grateful Dead, Queen, Madonna, Ice-T, Joni Mitchell, Frank Zappa, Neil Young, Alice Cooper, and dozens more"".Yeah? Where?The artists are merely footnotes in this saga; weirdos to be tolerated (barely) and joked about. I spent a lot of money on this tome hoping to read about some of them. Instead I got 450 pages of business talk with about 4500 witticisms to amuse and confuse.At least I found out why their awesome back catalogue has shamefully been left to earn whatever dollars it can in crappy 80's CD output (in the main) while other labels remaster properly and expand on their reissues - Warners just don't give a damn.Won't be reading it again, I assure you."
2,Which is more interesting...,"...music and the people who create it, or music executives and the deals they grind out?If you answered the latter, this book is for you. If you answered the former, you will be exasperatingly disappointed by this book.Good writing, tedious content."
1,Sent wrong book,Lame encyclopedia from the 80s instead... It says I need 14 more words but thats all I have to say lol
2,Highly recommend for insomniacs,I expected a book with some inside dirt on the recording industry but this is a sleeper recounting the author's 40 years working in Warner management. Those 100 or so souls who actually care about the mundane history of Warner records will enjoy this book. The rest of us would be better off with a subscription to Rolling Stone.
1,Predictable,"If you are familiar with Arabic movies, this one is painfully predictable. As most of what is produced in Egypt, it takes a lot of the political ""sensitivities"" of censors into account. If you are not familiar with Arabic movies, there are better starting points. If you want to learn about Nasser, read a book. If you like Nasser anyway, then you must see it."
3,Not Bronze,"These are aluminium with brown paint, not bronze at all. You get what you pay for. At the time of this writing, they were titled, Bronze Straight Casement Window Locking Handle; 2-3/8"" Screw Holes"
5,FIVE STARS PLUS!,"This book presents revealing stories of coverups in many fields, including medicine, alternate energy resources, archaeology, NASA, UFOs, etc. Many books and articles have been written through the years on these subjects, but I am grateful to the author for his well-researched, well-written compilation of so many of them into one source. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in educating themselves about how scientific arrogance and corporate greed have contributed to the steady decline of life on this planet. Nikola Tesla's ideas alone would have spared us many of the ecological disasters we now face. This book deserves 5 stars plus for its disclosure of the years of disinformation we have been given on matters of so much importance to us all."
1,"Why bother, watch the X-Files instead","Hmmmm, read this one intently at first, then faster and faster until I couldn't wait to put it down.Save yourself the time. Don't pick it up, watch the X-Files instead."
5,Don't Let The Image Fool You,"This disc will pulverize and beat you.Helmet was amongst one of the bands that helped to form the ""nu metal"" sound that many ""true metalheads"" have despised, along with Faith No More, Life Of Agony, White Zombie and Rage Against The Machine (why is Korn to blame?). Helmet was also a carrier of the ""noise rock"" scene with other artists like Unsane, Sonic Youth and The Jesus Lizard. This is one of the group's most underrated releases of all time.""Wilma's Rainbow"" delivers right to you, while ""Milquetoast"" and other select tracks tend to make you experience a very brutal noise session that makes your ears bleed. I can't really classify this as ""brutal"", as I listen to extreme death metal, but the ""underground"" sound that the guitars produce really attracts me, as I miss the 90's. This music still will beat you senseless until you collapse. Highly recommended, but not for the average alternative listener."
4,a new direction,"A jazzier, more offbeat version of Aftertaste, Betty has songs that make you sit up and beg for buttermilk, and songs that make you wonder what Page was thinking. A neccessary step to Aftertaste, and a damn good sounding step at that."
4,The mood comes and goes,"I like this album a lot. It's not for everyone, and it's not for every mood either. I love the sound thats angry angry angry, but still tight, and not out of control. I have to confess that I've gotten three speeding tickets while listening to this album."
4,not bad...,"This cd had a couple of great songs, and a couple of dumb songs. I cannot exactly give it 5 stars though. Uh, enough of me . Just buy it."
2,it's ok,"It works for the intended purpose. However, my two complaints are that one it looks kind of cheap. And second, it only secures at the top of the door hinge making it wobbly. It slides around."
3,Hole doesn't line up on our 60-year-old closet hinges,"We already had a four-rod towel rack from Hinge-It that has worked great on the back of our bathroom door for years, so we thought these brass hooks would be the perfect solution to our lack of a place to put visitors' jackets in the living room.But the brass hooks have a tighter hole than the white towel rack, and the hole is positioned too close to the stem of the hook for the hook to hang relaxed and parallel to the hinge. We were forced to leave the pin sticking up out of the hole about a half-inch, and, yet, even with this concession, the hook ends up hanging at an angle away from the hinge. It doesn't look great, but we're desperate for a solution to our problem.If you have modern hinges, this would work beautifully -- but if you have modern hinges, you'd probably have a place for visitors' jackets already. I don't understand why they made the hole so small and close to the stem of the hook."
3,Nice idea but product should be better,"I've looked in dozens of hardware stores to replace a similar hinge-pin hook I had and lost in move several years ago. The Hinge-It product is just what I was looking for. It works fine. But I have to say it doesn't work as well as the one I used to have (from an unknown manufacturer).The Hinge-It has two hooks, but could easily have three. And the hooks don't stay in place -- there's nothing to keep them from sliding from side to side. As I remember, my old hook stayed in place, didn't look as obtrusive and had three hooks.Still, I would recommend this for anyone who too much stuff and too little space."
5,The Best CD I Have Ever Heard!,"I am a big fan of Christina Aguilera. When I heard she was making a new CD I was so happy. First I saw the music video ""Dirrty"", I knew that the CD was gonna be good. Then I saw the music video ""Beautiful"", Another masterpiece. Then I saw the best music video ""Fighter"". I totally fell in love when I heard that song, Cause I can relate to it. Then I decided that I wanted that CD. It was the best CD I have ever heard since ""Thankful"". Anyone who thinks this CD sucks, They are so wrong!!!!!!!!!"
4,My Thoughts on Stripped (13 yrs. old),"When I first bought this cd i had the intention of only listening to about one song, but after giving it a try I realized that Christina Aguilera put alot of hard work into it and developed really good songs like ""Fighter"" and ""Can't Hold us down"". Actually I like this cd most out of all the one's she has so far made. I would recommend anyone to buy this cd.. you might find alot of it impressive!"
1,Terrible for younger listners,This album stinks. She is trying to be like Madonna. She will never be around long enough to outsell Mariah the real singer
1,Who the hell does she think she is??????,"Trashy clothes and trashy music. Yes, they do go together. And I find her voice simply annoying!!! Christina, Christina, Christina--You are NOT Whitney Houston, nor will you ever sing like her. You have the worst singing voice---EVER!!!!Please dye your hair back to its original blonde color! I can't stand it being black! Put on more decent clothes than a stupid nightgown you bought at Victoria's Secret!!!!And for God's Sake, please take out that damn nose ring!!!! You are NOT Janet Jackson!!!!Don't waste your money on this crap!!!! AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!! SOMEBODY MAKE HER STOP!!!!!Bottom Line: Christina may be beautiful and a great singer no matter what they say, but my words CAN bring her down!!!!"
2,I ...IT I ...IT,"This CD ...... I ain't gone lie she can really sing but every song on the album sounds the same... So ... boring and oh my God Christina get over the ""you can't hold me back"" and the ""I am beautiful"" mood because your style now ... and that's life. I am telling you guys DON'T BUY the album because it ain't all that. She has this dark side that I just don't like anymore... And plus she has grown up into the biggest ... now..."
5,Christina Aguilera Grows Up,"A leap from her self titled debut album, Christina releases ""Stripped"", an album of self discovery and revelation. She has definitley grown up, away from the stereotype of pop that Britney cast on pop music. The album is a mix of many musical genres, not just pop. She goes rock n roll with ""Im a Fighter"" and hiphop to ""Dirrty"" amongst others. Her collaboration with Alicia Keys, Linda Perry, Glen Ballard and others add a certain maturity to Christina's powerful vocals. (Although I have to admit, she sounds like Pink in some tracks). Her ballad ""Soar"" would make Mariah and Whitney proud, while the spunk of ""Dirrty"" can make Janet and Madonna smile. You can never find Britney or any other bubble gum singer sing such a song that is so revelaing and can leave you emotionally vulnerable, but Christina wears it like a scar. Five stars is not enough for ""Stripped"". Go ahead, buy it, its ceratinly worth your money."
3,Not quite there,"I am a Xtina fan, and once I heard her album was coming out I was excited beyond words; however, I've never been so disappointed in my life. I was strictly under the impression this would be an R&B record, as she once stated. Only, it isn't. I like all kinds of music, but Stripped's real appeal to me are her soul ventures. ""Walk away"" , ""Loving me for me"" , and ""Impossible"" are great songs. ""Get mine, get yours"" and ""Dirrty"" get tired after a while. ""Stripped"" should've been a song instead of just an intro and interlude. Eventually, I got more into the album, and found that ""Soar"" and ""The voice within"" made me miss the ""Music Box"" Mariah. I'm not very in love with ""Beautiful"", but the video is great. ""Make over"" is her best experimental song. A great improvement from her ""Genie..."" days, but still not exactly what I was hoping for."
5,Beautiful and empowering,"It took her a while but she came back in full force. All the tracks are great and they show that she really grew up. Through her songs, you understand that she grew into a woman who's comfortable in her skin, sexuality, and just her place in the world. You hear her tears in ""I'm Okay"", singing about her abusive father and you feel her love for herself in ""Beautiful"" a song that encourages self love and determination in believing in all that you are. Every woman should own this album. You won't be wasting your time. She kicks Britney's ass with this."
5,Stripped and naked!!!,"Excellent album, in case that u don't know this, the latin american version includes ""Dame Lo Que yo te doy"" spanish version of Get mine, Get Yours. you can also get that on the Beautiful cd single from Canada... too bad there wasn't an special edition from the album, with a bonus dvd or something that could've been great to increase the sales, cause in the us only sold the half that sold the Selftitled album"
4,Near Pop Perfection,"Christina does have a great voice, but sometimes it seems as though she oversings and it makes her music a bit unbearable...but that's just my opinion. However, this is a very solid cd, ""Beautiful"" and ""Cruz"" are wonderful and so is ""Infatuation"". Despite the criticism, Christina has proven that she has staying power and talent to back it up. Good for her!"
2,aguilera has lost the new album round it goes to spears!!!,stipped isnt a memorable album at all!! christina has lost her touch with funky songs all this is just whiney. boring and silly material and i was her i wouldnt sing about them i would keep it secret!! britney is the only mousekettier with real talent and not aguilera or jacko wannabe timberlake!! christinas first album was brilliant and she brought it out again in spanish for some random reason!! but stripped is stripped without meaning!! its boring!!! and she ruins da songs by over doing her voice!!!!! your not a fighter your a loser!!!
5,"Oh, that voice!","Christina has a voice unlike any other. She is a very talented girl - I did not buy her first album...but 'Stripped' seemed different, so I thought I'd take a chance.It's a very well developed album. She addresses issues in her life, that are touching - and important.She has a style of her own. I highly recommend this album - for people who don't want bubble gum pop music sound, but quality well developed music."
4,Great Pick,"I love this CD. I didn't used to be a huge fan of Christina, but this cd is the perfect way to showcase her talent. She has a couple songs on it that you've heard on the radio... and then some others. Great for a gift to a teenager!"
5,Stripped but for different reasons,"When you first look at this album you think ""stripped how convenient just what Christina Aguilera would call her album"". However this assumption about this album is not true it is more like her emotions are being stripped down and shown to the world this is a very powerful and touching album. Which, uncovers her true feelings about her life that has sad aspects to it. Christina Aguilera's voice is also original and her music has a flare of her own that she puts into her song. This is her best album yet and should be appreciated by audiences the world over."
4,CHRISTINA HAS THE VOCALS.,"SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE. MY FAVORITE SONGS FROM THIS ALBUM ARE ""GET MINE, GET YOURS,"" ""IMPOSSIBLE,"" ""CAN'T HOLD US DOWN"" FT. LIL' KIM, ""WALK AWAY,"" ""LOVING ME 4 ME,"" I ALSO LIKE THE INTERLUDES."
4,Bland.,"This is a very bland album by Christina Aguilera. It is supposed to show her sexual side like Madonna did in Erotica but it just turns out boring. Besides I am sick of sexual music, I would rather just have her make quality music. For me ""Dirty"" is probably the worst songs I have heard this year. I don't recommend this album [...]."
3,interesting and important yet flawed,"christina aguileras new cd, stripped, is supposed to be the pop diva-in-training at her most vulnerable, but instead it pretty much turns into a giant sorrow-fest for the singer. apparently christina went through hell before making this album, cause sometimes it feels like that for the listener. other times, however, she can be provocative, titillating, even intelligent...i know, crazy isnt it. listen to ""cant hold us down,"" ""walk away,"" ""get mine, get yours"" and ""dirrty"" and throw the rest of the album away."
5,wow,"It's amazing how much one person can grow in a period of 3 years. This album is simply amazing considering the one preceding it. Everything here is wonderful and serves a purpose, nothing seems filler, mundane, or boring. Christina's voice is amazing as well. Christina helped write all but two of the songs (""Beautiful"" and ""Impossible"") yet no one song reigns ""supreme"" on the album. Pick up this album if you're a fan of Christina and pick up this album if you're a fan of music in general. The CD is almost a plethora of musical style. Rock, Pop, R&B, Jazz, Funk. It's all here and it's all good. Stand out tracks : ""Fighter,"" ""Loving Me 4 Me,"" ""Beautiful,"" ""Cruz,"" ""Soar,"" and ""I'm OK.""Do yourself a favor and pick this album up. It's simply amazing."
4,Stripped is worth it!!,"I was at first apprehensive about buying this CD after hearing Dirrty but I am really glad I did. All the songs are amazing. And with the exception of Dirrty, and maybe one or two others, offer a message of some sort to the listeners. ""Beautiful"" is a wonderful ballad about self-esteem. On ""I'm OK"" Christina sings about her abusive father with the only backing music being a guitar. This album is full of could-be-singles and is worth every penny!"
4,"Christina shows her unpleasantly pleasant ""stripped"" side","Christina has grown up a lot since her ""Genie in the Bottle"" days. On her new disc, she strips down and shows us what she is truly made of. Her voice is awesome, and she even co-wrote most of the songs (a terrific move that makes her music more personal). Her new CD reminisces that of Mariah's ""Daydream"" and ""Butterfly"" albums. She deals with the controversy of the Eminem/Fred Durst rumours (""Can't Hold Us Down""), respect, self-esteem (""Beautiful""), and domestic abuse (""I'm OK). This is truly a feat that most pop artists don't pull off...well. Christina, however, soars her way to the top with her new album."
4,Christina Aguilera Stripped Review,"Hello, I am just joing to tell you how these songs rank on my scale.Stripped intro pt.1- It is a really cool intro, but it's a little risky for someone so sweet.Can't hold us down- It is just like Vanessa Hudgens ""Never Underestimate A Girl"" except this song is worse and it has curse words.Walk away- Good song, A little boring.Fighter- AMAZING SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't feel like writing about the other songs. Here are just my favorites:BeautifulFighterDirrty (ft. Redman)Stripped pt.1Stripped pt.2Can't hold us downThe voice within"
5,The Words of a Lyrical Goddess,"This CD completely astonished me when I first listened to it. It's now my favorite CD. Christina has undoubtedly matured immensely on this CD. Thre are no teeny-bopper songs featured and this CD is aimed at a more mature audience compared to her previous albums. However, kids and teens of all ages may be able to relate to some of the more personal songs, and everyone will enjoy the inspirational and uplifting songs. This isn't much of a club CD or even a dance CD either. Don't let the ""Dirty"" single fool you. There are probably around 3 club/dance joints on this CD. Everything else is either deep and personal or romantic and caring. You'll hear her lovely voice but with the lyrics it'll sound raw and uncensored; that isn't a bad thing either. If you wanted a more mature Christina, you'll find it in this CD."
2,Good voice\Just wish she sings differently,"The CD is definitely POP, she has a strong voice, but because she is on the POP side, I don't like how she sings her songs. Impossible, Singing My Song, and maybe a few other are good. Definitely not my liking, she has vocals, so I wish her continued success and hope she will continue to blow away the non singing pop singers out there."
5,Better than the first,"Even though I am a Christina fan I thought that this album wasn't going to be good. Because I thought it took to long to come out, plus they kept pushing the date back. When my mother bought it for me for Christmas I hesitated to open it because I thought I wouldn't like it. But when I listened to it the night after Christmas I loved it. I think this is better than the first album. It's too bad that it heartache and pain in a relationship for the album to be this good. Some of the songs really hit home with me, I could relate to alot of them. My favorites are ""Can't hold us down, Fighter, Infauation, Impossible,Get mines get yours, Dirrty, I'm Okay, and The voice within."" I defintely recommend this album to anyone, even if they didn't buy the first album."
5,A Fresh Sound From a Beautiful Familiar voice,"Xtina's new album, Stripped, is a wonderful exploration of sound and style. She effortlessly saranades us through many different styles of music. ""Beautiful"" is a song that is just like it's name. It is essential for all women to listen to it. ""I'm ok"" is a stunnenly emotional tribute to her childhood past. This cd honestly is one you can just sit and listen to without having to change tracks because each and every one is wonderful. I highly recommend for everyone to buy it. Anyone would like it...It defys genres!"
4,The best pop record I've heard in a really long time!,"After you've listened to this record, you would never compare Christina to the other teen pop stars again. You will start comparing her to Alicia Keys, Whitney and Mariah. Yes, it is that good.She listened to the critics and stop overdoing it with bountiful, unnecessary high notes and focused more on emotion. With the exception of ""Dirrty"", every song on this album is exceeded my expections by a mile and then some. My mouth literally dropped open when I heard the ballads, ""Beautiful"" and ""Walk Away"". ""Impossible"" featuring Alicia Keys, ""I'm OK"", and the Pink-tinged, ""Underappreciated"" are some of the other standout tracks.I am not a big pop fan. I like jazz and indie European artists who most Americans have never heard of. So, even if you aren't a pop fan, you will not be disappointed by this cd. Christina has a long career ahead of her."
5,Sing it sista!,"My cousin bravely bought this album as I was taunting and teasing her all the way through the checkout, and let me just say, I began eating my words the moment we listened to it. I am NOT a fan of Christina's nor Britney's nor any of the boy bands...but this is not crappy or plastic like those typically and generally annoying so-called musicians...no, this is an amazing musical experience that sets Christina apart from her peer crowd! I guess i was expecting cheap, trite, stereotypical and demeaning lyrics, but this CD is QUITE the opposite! By the third song I felt extremely empowered! Thank god for women who tell it and sing it like it is...so passionate, feisty, and beautiful! The sound is also incredible...the entire album was mixed very well...it splendidly shows off Christina's amazing vocal talents. For all of the Christina loathers or anyone who is not quite sure they want to take a chance on this album, I strongly suggest giving it a listen. You just might be surprised."
5,"Who Cares How She Looks, We're Not Dating Her!","Her CD is wonderful. And for those of you that take exception to her image and impression on young girls, don't look at it. She is not here to parent your children but just entertain them with song. If she is their role model, then you have more important concerns than Christina's clothing or lack thereof. This is about music! Just imagine this CD BEFORE the age of music video. It would STILL get radio play unlike many of her so called peers! Britney can't carry a note in a bucket and Mandy WHO??? I like that she is confident enough to be and look the way she wants despite the critics. Her voice is unmatched in the world of teen popdem. She has something that others don't-staying power. Keep singing Christina! Do your thing!"
5,It's about time I gave my own review!!!,"Besides the song, ""Dirrty"", the album ""Stripped"" is a good album. There were many different styles of music which make it great. There is R&B;, Soul, Rock and Hip Hop on it. I'll tell you why the following songs made me feel good:Fighter- Helps to overcome victimization. Anyone who has been abused in any way will relate to this song.Makeover- People manipulate others for their own gratification. Those ""others"" don't need people to make them over.Beautiful- We all have differences that we must love each other for.Soar- You have to listen to your inner self no matter what others say.The Voice Within- Listen to the good voice within yourself, and not the negetivity of others.Can't Hold Us Down- It's funny how Christina and Lil'Kim EXPOSE the double standards of Male/Female sexuality. ...I'm a Male and I agree with Chris and Kim on this song. ...If you minus the sexuality of this record, ""Stripped"" is very good, and diffinitely helps people of all ages."
4,She's Grown Up!!,"Wow!! Christina has grown up! She sure isn't the same ""girl"" she was on her first c.d. Christina has evolved into a woman. I love her new songs, they all rock. She is an amazing singer, and I eagerly wonder what she'll do next. The only reason I rated this c.d. four stars is because I really don't like all her body piercings, especialy the one on her nose. Plus, I don't like how she keeps yelling in some of the songs. It gets really annoying after a while. Otherwise, a fantastic, great c.d."
1,God Awful,Well I did like Christina's first cd but you know after her xmas cd I should have had 2nd thoughts about this one as with the xmas cd she just went way over the top bawling out her lungs.This album I feel is a total mess. I would not recommend it and wish I hadn't wasted my money. It was a big disppointment. I think she's a very confused person if this album is anything to go by and clearly she should not have co-wroted these songs as it's obvious she has no talent in that area.
2,YUCK!!!,"I know most people will disagree with me, but what happened to cute ""genie in a bottle"" christina?This image of her does not impress me and neither does her music, her songs are soooooo depressing!!! I like optimistic songs please. I know she says that this album is actually her, so good for her. Because with the amount of albums she has sold, the people like her better this way too. So good for them. But please, if you are like me, and live a happy optimistic life, and LIKE it that way, DONT buy this cd."
2,"Don't Believe The Hype- ""Stripped"" Isn't Really All That","There were a few songs that I liked on the CD, but the rest were just boring. Oversinging doesn't really impress me; you tend to lose the feeling of a song that way and all you start to hear is a bunch of shouting. Christina needs to develop her own style and come up with some kind of vocal trademark. She has an alright voice but she pretty much sounds like a smorgasbord of various popular female artists. Anyway, I didn't know that Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Alicia Keys were singing back up vocals for Christina. Other than that, most of these songs don't stand out and I would rather listen to a Joss Stone album instead of this again."
4,"Good Cd come back, Bad look","There is no doubt about it guys. This girl can sing. This Cd is full of good songs, great melodys and catchy beats. The only reason I pulled back from that one star to make it 5. Is her warbrobe. No no Christina, that is not you. Usually people who can't sing dresses like this for attention. You have the voice and your own look. Leave Pink alone. Otherwise, I could name all the tracks on this Cd that is really good, I won't cause it's the whole CD. From ""Beautiful"" to "" Fighter"". All good. Who ever doesn't like this album, doesn't know a thing about music. Good Job. Next CD I will be in front of line to purchase it, just put on some cloths."
2,"Try again, Christina.....","Christina Aguilera has a great voice, she just needs to get better material. I was relieved, however, to discover that the rest of the CD is not at all similar to 'Dirrty.' Basically, Christina has decided to ditch bubblegum pop and go for a more R&B/rock sound. Still, considering the amount of time it took to make this CD, I was let down. There are a few good tracks, like 'Beautiful'and 'Can't Hold Us Down. If your looking for an innovative album, you're looking in the wrong place. ""Stripped"" is nothing more than your average pop-princess-decides-she-wants-to-stand-out-so-she-runs-to-'cool'-producers album. Unfortunately, Linda Perry couldn't do for Christina what she did for P!NK."
2,Stay in da bottle!,"Christina... were do I start. First of all I remember loving the genie in a bottle, I mean the sexy genie in da bottle back in 1999. The blonde hair, the great smile and her angelic style in white, but all the sudden BLACK HAIR, MEDIUM SKIN COLOR, BLACK DRESSES and BLACK NAILS. I hate the dirty songs of this album the only song that i really like is the voice within and it is for girls, and what the heck about her million boy fans that she has, Christina has forgoten about us and saying stupid things about guys like in cant hold us down. Leave all the rock and evil style to Amy Lee she looks better in it. Its the only one that it fits to her but, Christina needs to go back to her style or else she will turn into everybodys clown and I will buy the tickets to the circus to see what style Christina has today !!"
1,So when did the trend of people screaming makes them a good,... singer?All this women does on this disc is scream and it's not 1 song but all the songs..So when people sing there considered the best singer in the world!!!!!!!!!! WOW..............
5,YOU GO GIRL!!!!,"Ok at first when I popped this cd in my cd player,I just didnt like her songs AT ALL,none of the songs caught my attention,I just could not like this album for nothin,But then I kept on listenin to it again an again,now this cd is really tight,she really did a good job on it,an she has a beautiful voice to go wit her album.1.Stripped(Intro)2.Can't hold us down- 4 1/2/53.Walk away- 5/54.Fighter- 5/55.Primer amor(Interlude)6.Infatuation- 4 1/2/57.Love embrace(Interlude)8.Loving me 4 me- 5/59.Impossible- 5/510.Underappreciated- 3 1/2/511.Beautiful- 3/512.Make over- 2/513.Cruz- 5/514.Soar- 3/515.Get mines,get yours- 5/516.Dirtty- 4/517.Stripped pt218.The voice within- 5/519.Im ok- 4 1/2/520.Keep on singin my song- 4/5Even tho I cannot stand her,I gave her props!"
4,bout time,"Theres no doubt that this girl has pipes, and the material on this album is great, but just to answer a review the reason she hasnt surpassed Britney is simply because when it comes to performing there are few if any people that can deliver a performance like Britney does, like it or not it's the truth."
3,Good album,"Love this album, much better than Britney's ""In The Zone"" but check out Janet's album ""Damita Jo"" in stores March 30th"
2,Whiz! Bang! Your computer can produce CDs!,"It's clear Christina Aguilera is trying to do something a bit more daring than the previous teenybopper stuff, at least as much as her company will let her. Much has been made of the provocative nature of her videos and lyrics in songs such as ""Drrty,"" but this album is not especially dirty to listen to. The real problem is that amidst the many digital edits and attempts to link things together is a paucity of melody, or when one does show up it sounds schmaltzy and dull, like another ballad from 1985. The digital sound is eventually annoying (the bass guitar sounds like it came out of a machine, as of course the drums actually did) and the many gimmicky cuts and splices that are supposed to dazzle us grow tiresome. Christina has a pretty good voice, if not an original or defining style, but her voice does not justify spending the money to buy this long mess of an album."
5,Go Girl!,"I was very impressed when I listened to this CD. Christina has a tremendous voice and has come a long way from the little girl that came on the scene a few years ago. I enjoy each and every one of the tracks, yet my most favorite is the one by Alicia Keys. I must say that she is definitely on her way. Watch out Britney Spears!"
4,"Good Looks, Great Voice","This CD is acutally pretty good! Even though some people see Christina as just a sleep around kind of girl, she really CAN sing. I have to give her credit because she actually wrote most of the songs on the CD. To me that meant that she is starting to take her career a little more seriously. But, as we know to much from Christina, there is a picture of her nude in this CD. And there is another picture of her wearing extremely Short shorts and her back is toward the camera, so you see about 2 and a half inches of her ass. But, the music on this CD is good. She has a nice rock voice...I recommend it!"
4,good second effort,"I just bought this cd today, and I'm already totally in love with it. I've never really liked her music or image, but I heard this song ""Impossible"" that my friend had downloaded and it was awesome. I decided to buy the album, and it is very good. I think the best tracks are ""Impossible"", ""Infatuation"", and ""Beautiful"". All of them are good though, and her cd has some what of a rock/latin feel to a lot of the songs. I think the ballads are the strongest though because of her wonderful voice. The downside is that some of the upbeat songs sound kind of the same."
5,I hate to admit it...,"I hate to admit it, but this album is excellent. I am not a fan of this artist, but I heard the album because my niece has it. I was shocked at the vocal talent and quality of the songs used. I can't believe this is the Genie in A Bottle Girl! In comparison, the last Britney Spears album isn't half as good as this one. There are several beautiful ballads that I dare anyone with an open mind to listen to...Beautiful is just that Beautiful. Soar is also an excellent song. Give this one a listen and you will not be disappointed."
5,"Christina is ""Stripped"" down to herself, and raw talent!","Christina's taking control of her career turns out to be the best thing she could've ever done. This 20 track album is so continuously good, there is not one mistake on this album...you feel her every emotion on this record. You have your uplifting songs, your sensual songs, and yes your party songs...you have a diverse and wonderful album to fit all moods that you are inGREAT JOB CHRISTINA!!!..."
4,the best of her,"This album has excellent songs! Walk away, infatuation, i'm ok and beautiful, it has very deep letters, but she shouts too much, abuses her voice, in ocaciones tires"
5,god sent,"she is a beautiful person!! i love her voice, she sings like an angel. i could listen to her all day long!"
3,"Not As Good As the Debut, But...","I think this album goes to show that Christina is trying to grow up way too fast. But, that doesn't make this album completely terrible. Some good songs on this album are: ""Can't Hold Us Down"", ""Fighter"", ""Beautiful"", ""Loving Me For Me"", ""Get Mine, Get Yours"", ""I'm OK"", ""Dirrty"", ""The Voice Within"", ""Singing My Song"", and ""Impossible"". If you're a huge Christina fan like I am, buy this album."
1,Stripped(Better Skipped),"I bought this album on thinking there would be Great singing as on her self titled Album.Instead I found poorly written music a lot of shouting and only one really good song with a singer and that's ""Its Impossible"".""Beautiful""Is a good message but the music isn't up to it.This isn't a good ""Listening To""Album this is performing on stage music.I love Christina's Great Voice.This is not up to the Quality of music she should be singing.I understand she strained her Vocal Chords well this album is certainly why she did""Its a whole lot of shouting going on"".I sent my ""Stripped"" Album to file 13 as Trash.But I'll continue to listen to Christina Self titled Album and hope her next work will do more to showcase her Great Voice if she has one left after all this shouting on Stripped."
1,boring,"this cd is very boring. Stripped does show how good of a singer she is but all her songs are stupid and pointless. Dirrty is a good dance song but trash the video. that was a publicity stunt to show that christina has to fight for her trophy over britney. I will give her credit for some songs. Fighter is a great song, and Unfactuation. But if you want something more that christina singing about her problems. get another one"
1,Talk about Overproduced man!!!,"The so called ""music"" is so overproduced!! I'll admit that I liked a few of the songs. Now, i said a FEW. Like, ""DIRRTY"" ""FIGHTER"" ""BEAUTIFUL"" and thats about it. Seriously. It is that bad. And this CD had how many hit singles again? Oh, oh yes that right, none. Christina talks so much trash, I'm surprised that she can still ""sing"" with the dump of a voice she has. if she hadn't talked so much trash, she might sound okay. So, my advice to her is, quit while your ahead dearheart. Don't look back!! Count your blessings child. Oh, by the way, Christina, you don't even hold a candle to Kelly Clarkson. Or Pink for that matter. All those people you talked trash about, unlike you, have a little something called class."
1,Is this Good?,"I seriously do not see what all these people who have reviewd found so great about stripedd!yeah, christina has a powerfull voice, but she screams so much that is annoying.Some songs like can't hold us down are so ridiculous that is not even funny. And then there are some songs that you wonder if you haven't heard it before!and the big problem i have with this cd is that there are too many songs...twelve was enough!"
1,What?,"In a nice, compact package, the most vile aspects of humanity have been assembled in Christiana Aguilera's album ""Dirty."" In shocking fashion, pure, unadultered sensualism remains the albums core. The album's forthcoming success represents the irrationality of humankind; my grounds for this statement is, although music is subjective to taste, the songs played here are neither witty lyrically, and their over-produced musical background only delves into the cliches of big-studio production. Unfortunatly this album will lead to large sales, and sadly, more insecurity in all of womankind."
3,Why?,"Christina Aguilera is an extremely talented vocalist, and her songs are worthy of my listening time. So why does she have to be so trashy? The only singers that act trashy are talentless ones, and in so many people's eyes, the talented Christina is taking on this image! If she would just dress in more appropriate clothes, and lose the disgusting nose ring, I would probably be a fan of hers.My favorite songs on this album are ""Fighter"", and ""Beautiful"". ""Fighter"" has more of a rock beat, and Christina shows off her rock vocals. ""Beautiful"" is a song about not letting other's insults get to you, and I think Christina really shows off her vocals in this song, as well.If you want talented Ms. Aguilera without the trash, check out her first album, which I is self-titled. Or if you don't mind the trash, then I believe you'll enjoy this album.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
5,Awesome CD,"This CD is a wonderful CD! I just got it today and I havent stopped listening to it since. Anyone out there who is thinking bout getting it should get it. Dont let the cover get you down. Yes she is a lil ""revealing"" but the CD is called ""stripped"". I love this CD and I would recomend it to everyone. The songs have such powerful meanings, especially ""Beautiful"". I hope I helped."
1,Stripped? or strip joint?,"OK....not to be ""Hatein"" but what in the world is she thinking. Everyone thinks she has enourmous talent...lol problay not her vocals they are concintrating on. Not my style, she sounds like shes a banshi on this cd. The songs are very annoying and her voice sounds the same on all the tracks. Very boring. The best song on the cd would have to be ""Fighter"". Seriously, this album sounds like kermit the frog got signed to a record deal. Little hint kiddies Just because someone can scream and take off their clothing with no shame does NOT mean they have talent it means they belong at a go-go bar or a very lame old rock concert."
1,Just a horrible CD!,There all the same style of music and sound all alike the only song I liked for a while was Beautiful now I despise it every time I hear it you can loose alot of interest on this CD very fast!
1,"This is a CD not an ""American Idol"" audition!","Im so sick of all these ppl ""singing"" their music like they're auditioning for American Idol! Overshouting till the point of annoyance. So much it ruins the songs. Shell lose her voice from shouting so much like that. Listen to when she sings normal and hear how much she stinks. When shes not shouting, she sounds like an average girl. She is imitating Whitney and Mariah and their voices were naturally deep and loud. Alicia Keys, C hristina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson need to start singing and stop shouting. Then you'll see how horrible their voices are. If you want good fun pop music without overshouting check out Madonna or Britney (her debut, not her recent crap). Someone stop them before they ruin their vocal chords!!"
2,so when did dirty become beautiful,"On October 29, 2002, RCA released Christina Aguilera's new CD, ""Stripped."" Instead of singing about crushes and jeannies in bottles, Christina now sings twenty songs about being ""Dirty,"" expressing who you are as in ""Beautiful,"" and how girls should be able to sleep with whomever they want without a guilty conscience as asserted in ""Can't Hold Us Down."" Christina makes a pathetic attempt to show how she has changed from her previous pop image to her new ""Dirty"" image. In her song ""Beautiful,"" she sings about how she is beautiful just being herself, which apparently is a pound of makeup along with numerous facial piercings. I give ""Stripped"" 2 stars out of 5 because Aguilera does have singing capability; however, she exerts far to much effort, in her songs, in trying to replace her past innocent image with a new sex-driven powerful persona."
3,Honest review.,"The album does contain a lot of great ""Pop"" tracks such as ""Dirrty"", ""Get mine, Get yours"", ""Fighter"", ""Infatuation"", ""Can't hold us down"", ""Beautiful"" and her latest single ""The voice within"" but as far as this being R&B or Hip Hop, this album is not what some are describing it as. The songs are ""POP"" with a little bit sampling of different genere's...Christina will always be a popstar, and there's nothing wrong with that. She should still be taken seriously regardless of what type of singer she is."
3,"I like her voice, but not her.","Don't get me wrong, Christina Aguilara has a good voice and some real talent, (...)Typically, women who look like her are only found on street corners, in bars, or strip clubs, but she's very good at singing. I especially like how she performs that one song on Nelly's new CD and does it great. Nelly has a bad voice but I like his music, and she adds to the quality. Honestly, I only gave this CD three stars because of her appearence. Like I said, women like her do nothing but have dirty sex and show all their skin, but not her. I like this CD, so go buy it, regardless of who made it."
4,I love this album,"I'd forgotten what a great record this was. It meshes together some of my favorite genres of music--r&b;, pop, and rock. It's very personal and very captivating. Every artist comes to a point in their career where they want to tell their life story or give a little insight into their past. This album is it. It's basically X-tina's take on love, life, and relationships. I was a little upset though, because most of the tracks I like were not released as singles even though they should have been. Some of my favorite songs are--Walk Away--This is one of the most powerful tracks on the album. X-tina talks about the rise and fall of a very intense relationship. You can really hear the passion in her voice.Get Mine,Get Yours--The most sensual song she's made to date. I love this song.Loving Me for Me--A very lighthearted, romantic track. Definitely a feel good song.I love this album and would recommend it to any and everyone."
4,Not What You'd Expect,"I bought Christina Aguilera's new CD the day it came out. I was expecting it to be...well, of course, DIRTY, provacative, sexual, and dominately hip hop. I was VERY wrong. At the most, there were about 4 provacative songs (not too bad considering her debut song & video) and the flavor of her music was more original, less hip hop than I expected. It blends pop, hip hop, and a little rock flair with meaningful lyrics. Of course, her voice is strong and empowering as usual, and in songs like ""Fighter"", ""Beautiful"", and ""Impossible"" it shines through beautifully. You can tell this album really did mean a lot to her...it sounds as if it came from the heart, which you don't always expect from a *pop star*. Overall, I'd say this album was pretty dang good, and will rise to the top when compared to the work of her fellow divas/pop rivals."
4,Huge improvement!,"Before moving on, let's get one thing straight: Christina has a great voice. And thank goodness, she finally learned how to use it.Unfortunatly, she seems confused as to which direction she wants her music to take. Don't judge the album by ""Dirrty,"" it's easily the weakest song on the album.Don't get me wrong, though. Among the changing genres are some real ""stand-out"" tracks. The best songs on the album, in my personal opinion, are: Beautiful, I'm Ok, Impossible, and Underappreciated. Remember the Olympics? Christina performed ""Infatuation,"" which, again, misrepresented the album. But, more than half a year later, it's still catchy as heck.By itself, this album would rate three stars. But, if you take into consideration Christina's amazing voice, and the improvement from her last album (""Christina Aguilera"" was a real stinker of a CD), it easily bumps it into 4-star territory."
5,So satisfying,"This album is what every Christina fan has been waiting for - as promised, you can hear her incredible voice, without over-trilling, or whatever you want to call it, on every track.I was surprised by the diversity of the tracks. Dirrty is actually really different than anything else on the album. While I love that song, it was nice to hear a range of styles, from lots of smooth ""Butterfly""-ish Mariah-sounding stuff and interludes to the heavy guitar anthem-ish ""Fighter"" to an alterna-pop, somewhat Pink-ish ""Make-over"". There's also ""Soar"", which has some Dixie-Chicks-ish harmony at the beginning, and ""Impossible"", which sounds exactly how you would expect an Alicia Keys song to sound.All in all, it's a great melange with the strength and versatility of Christina's vocals throughout. I think a lot of people will be surprised by the depth of the album, given the weak material of her first album. It's such a welcome change to hear her singing material worthy of her voice!"
5,Pure Christina!,"love this album. the beat rocks. her voice is fantastic. if you like the ""early"" Christina aguilera, this one is for you."
5,"Love that ""Dirrty"" Girl's pipes!!!!!!!!","This Cd is full of such great music and lyrics. I loved Dirrty and Fighter, they are the reasons I bought the Cd. After listening to the entire Cd I found so many other great songs. She is talented. Although people may not appreciate Christina's attitude or clothing choices, the girls got some pipes! Anyone who claims she can't sing or the album isn't good needs to listen to all the other pop stars out there........Christina has them all beat. I attended her concert in Philly and she sounded as good in concert. To top it off, she writes her own music and dosen't use machines to enhance her voice. One of the best albums as a whole that I have bought in a long time!!!!!!!"
5,If you don't have 'Stripped' go buy it!,"Christina's ""Stripped"" album is definately one of the best CD's to come out in 2003."
5,AMAZING!,"THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING! Its better than I thought it would be.My fave songs on the album are ""Fighter"", ""walk away"", ""Infatuation"", ""Loving for me"" ""dirrty"", ""underappreciated"" and ""Impossible"". OMG! THE SONG IMPOSSIBLE IS AMAZING! ALICIA KEYS IS GREAT! Christina has a phenomenal voice and she wrote most of the songs on here. The second half of the album isnt as good as the first, but i stil love it! EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM!""Stripped"" along with ""Justified""=BEST ALBUMS OF 2003. I LOVE CHRISTINA SO MUCH MORE AFTER BUYING THIS ALBUM! SHE RULES!"
4,Dee,This is a great CD. Christina definately has powerful vocal talent. The songs are very well written and performed very well. Christina dug deep down inside herself to write these songs AND sing them. I would definately recommend this to anyone.
5,Outstanding Album,"I just bought the cd and am thoroughly pleased with it. This isn't a cd for little girls ages 3-13 like some of her previous stuff. The album is all about her voice and some great writing. If you are looking for typical pop, you might want to look elsewhere. She has definetely changed for the better!"
4,She Stepped It Up,You gotta admit that this is not the same Genie In a Bottle girl showing up on this album. This is a very mature album and glad that Christina took charge of her direction in music. It definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it won't be disappointed.
4,A good solid cd,I loved this album..it showed tat at the time she was diferent and uniqe...when others where still singing pop songs..she was singing songs tat acutually mean something
5,Its one of the good ones.,I have two of her CDs now this one included. Im here to tell you plain and simple I have never been disappointed.
2,stripped a bit too bare,"20 tracks of angst and poor pitiful me. Which is unfortunate -- yeah yeah, you're so put upon. The production is excellent, the musicianship outstanding and Christina is in great voice. Might be best for her to give up writing her own stuff until there is actually some life to write about."
1,Not so good...,"These songs on this album are so cheasy and dum,Her voice is annoying as hell I dont see anything good about it plus the song quality on this album is bad..I highly suggest you dont get this!"
2,Stripped to the mediocre core,"I'm bored with this CD. Lets just review the tracks.1. Intro- Whatever. Unremarkable.2. Can't Hold Us Down- This has a weak beat! The lyrics are too self involved.3. Walk Away- Too long and too dull.4. Fighter- Dave Navarro please step away from pop.5/6. Infatuation- Damn good song.7/8. Loving Me 4 Me- Best track on here. It is totally awesome.9. Impossible- Bland. She's no Jill Scott.10. Underappreciated- What?11. Beautiful- Not bad, pretty good.12. Make Over- You are no Courtney Love.13. Cruz- Bored14. Soar- getting more bored.15. Get Mine, Get Yours- horrible lyrics but good beat.16. Dirrty- Eh, mediocre.17. Stripped Part 2- Do we really need a part two?18. The Voice Within- Fallin' asleep19. I'm OK- Woke up.20. Keep On Singin' My Song- Whatever.This album is way too self involved. Me me me!"
1,this album sux,"i give it one star for the song fighter. i love pop music, and this cd is NOT it. Can't hold us down, fighter, beautiful, cruz, soar, dirrty, a voice within, singing my song are good songs. The rest are so absolutely dreadful, you'll want to throw up and never listen to her again. Get the song fighter and her first and christmas cd."
1,Pop Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I miss the old Christina. This is so not like her. If you want a real pop album, buy the album Christina Aguilera. I would have given this - 5 stars if I could. I only like one song and it's called The Voice Withi. But even thats CRAPPY. Never buy this cd. It's trash. Why do you think there is a half naked woman on the cover. Junk."
5,She Can Sing and Make Good Music,"I got this CD as a gift.The first listen wasn't valuable.The second listen was better.Then I listened to it more.The more I listened to it the more I became addicted.My favorite song was ""Infatuation.""It is very catchy.It explains about her first love(Or at least I think it does).It is 4 minutes and 17 seconds.It has an interlude that goes with it.The interlude is ""Primer Amor.""It is in spanish.It is 53 seconds.This album has many diferent genres.I'm glad Christina took the time to do something creative.She wrote most of the songs.The only songs she didn't write were ""Beautiful"" and ""Impossible.""So go get this album."
4,Babygirl is grown,"The 22 year-old's newest CD is good, compared to her last CD, this one's gold. I really want Christina to do a song with Madonna, cause they both sing R&B and Pop and 'American Life' was a tight CD. Christina's new CD is good.1. 3/52. 4.6/53. 3.4/54. 4.9/55. 3.2/56. 3.8/57. 3/58. 4.7/59. 4.8/510. 4.1/511. 4.5/512. 4.6/513. 3.6/514. 3.5/515. 3.5/516. 4.9/517. 3/518. 3.1/519. 4.3/520. 4/5Like I said, it's a nice CD, especially numbers 2, 4, 8, 9, 12 and 16, but there is a little space left for her music to grow, it's early in her career, she has time to grow and learn."
2,Good Voice but...,"I personally think that Christina's voice is good (except when she just shouts), but in this album, most of all the songs are ballads, A cousin lend it to me, and i didn't finished it, it start's good, but it became kind of boring, Some songs has nice lyrics, but the beat is poor, I have just one advice, if you enjoyed the first cd of her, this would seem to you disappointing."
5,Christina Aguilera - Stripped in all senses,"When Christina Aguilera first dropped into the spotlight of teenage stardom, it was carefully molded. With the exception of her amazing voice, she was a carbon copy of all those other Mickey Mouse Club girls. But with this album, she brings it back to home, stripping everything (yes, including clothes) to make a wholesome and true album. Christina proudly holds writing credits on just about every track on this, her sophomore album, and even produces one. She shows her true colors with songs like ""Keep on Singing My Song"" and with a heartfelt confession to her father in ""I'm Okay"". Even though this album comes with a flurry of gossip on her seemingly barren body, there's one thing that holds very true: Christina Aguilera is no longer a little girl, and Stripped shows you the triumphs and pains of a young woman living in the harsh industry that we call music."
5,"although i like dirrty, the cd is so much bettter","dirrty gives the wrong impression to people aobut what the cd is like. don't get me wrong, i love the cd and i love dirrty. buy it, you won't be disappointed."
5,A GREAT COMBACK FOR XTINA!,"i think that christina as definately showed that she has made the all-time comeback. She has a little rock (""Fighter"") and a lot of personal songs (my favorite, ""I'm OK""). THIS CD IS AWESOME! i absolutely looooove it!!!!! :-)i stronly suggest to buy it. i just cant believe all of this great music was under ""genie in a bottle"". what a better change."
4,Good!,"this album is pretty good..her voice is beautiful...i like ""impossible"" and ""Infatuation"" the most in tha album..!"
5,Awesome gift,My mom loves christina aguilera so when i saw this CD and how much it was i had to snag it. no scratches or marks and it was fully wrapped
5,Britney who?,"This is a mature, sophisticated, artistic piece of work and who would have thought it came from Christina Aguilera. I always knew she had more vocal talent than all of her other pop counterparts put together, but I never thought she had the artistic vision and musicianship that she has displayed in this album not to mention a very talented songwriter that has already developed her own style. This album is sure to set her far far apart from her other peers and hopefully we will see bigger and better things from her in the future. She probably could change the pop world from what it is today with songs like ""Beautiful"" and ""The Voice Within"" that do more than talk about trivial things, but are more socially conscience. Something we need most of all in these days.Standout tracks :Walk AwayFighterLoving Me 4 MeBeautifulMake OverCruzThe Voice WithinI'm OKKeep On Singing My Song"
5,Brilliant,"I think this album is brilliant. It's got everything... callaborations, catchy melodies, meaningful lyrics (unlike Britney Spears who just sings about guys and doing it). In my opinion this album let's us see what Christina is all about.It also shows us how much Christina has grown up in the past few years. My fav songs are Soar, Fighter, Dirrty and Can't Hold Us Down. If you like Christina and you dont have this album, I strongly urge you to go out and buy it."
1,All you hear is yelling and screaming,The title of this comment tells everything...all she is doing is yelling
1,"yeah baby poiseBABY poise yeah, poise yeah baby..","sugar coated bimbo greedy needy sleazy cash dispenser sleek and chic ready for the trash heep of newer newer younger is better tokyo fetish cotton candy feline,purrscome percoscious or precious hither vodoo doll little girl play dress up pin up all primmed up by her pimp marketers, over and over again and again.. HER VOIcE A SWAN SIREN MUDDLED penetrating sounding choir choral screech all throaty[she smokes too much] car alarm sound.With manufactored teen PRE ANGST PROM ANXIETY lyrics"
2,Don't Get Me Wrong,"HI X-tina fans! I bought this album cause her first one was REALLY good!When I saw the video ""Dirrty"" I thought it was a good dance song then when I purchased the album I only liked 3of 20 songs! Wich is ""Fighter"",""Beautiful"",& the Dirty track""Dirrty""! Okay she wrote all of the songs! Wich is pretty good and has an AMAZING voice,but she should go back to her Geine days cause ""Stripped isn't what I expected 2 thumbs down and lost an fan also I say Britney is Better buy IN THE ZONE before you wanna get Dirrty! Well bye!"
1,shut the hell up girl,She screams on every song on this album. The lyrics are weak and dull and the music is bad really bad. Why waste money on this I don't understand what's wrong with you people. This is not good only crap. Stay away and please girl shut the hell up.
1,this album sucks,"please listen 2 me and don't buy this cd. i have buy it and now i just feel bad after listen to it. the reason that it bad is because christina write most the songs' lyrics. her writing is bad as well as the beat of the songs. i'm not being criticism but she should let the lyric to lyricists. although there are some good like &amp;quot;can't hold us down&amp;quot; &amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot; &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dirrty&amp;quot; but overall the bad outweight the good. if you bought this cd, i would feel sorry for you."
3,o its ok,20 song must i say more out of 20 songs theres only 10 good songs but hey her vocie rocks i wont say no more but if u want buy this cd i wont stop u
1,Micky Mouse Club Idiocy,"Even worse and more lame than Spears, Timberlake et al. Just putridly and relentlessly banal.Please Dear God Stop!NO More!"
2,Should have bought the single,"I ususally like Aguilera and I need a song to practice for dance so I bought this one for ""No Other Man"" figuring I would like the other songs as well. I was so wrong. I hate the rest of them."
1,AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,Read my lips this is garbage DO NOT BUY THIS DO YOU HEAR ME LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEYcapeishe.......... :)
2,Stripped from being any good,"This album contains two good songs (""Voice Within"" and ""Fighter"") 1 ok-ish song ""Dirrty"" and pads the rest out with crap hip hop songs and bad ballads. Never has an album been filled with so much crap to make up the song numbers. A waste of $15."
1,SUX BUT BETTER THEN BRITNEY,I HEARD THIS ALBUM FROM A FRIEND OF MINE AND I'LL SAY IT IS BETTER THEN HER FIRST ALBUM. ALOT BETTER THAN ALL OF BRITNEYS ALBUMS. BUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO CHRISTINA. SHES GONE FROM HOT CHICK TO UGLY A** GOTHIC CHICK.
2,Xtina,"I have mixed feelings about this woman. I don't like her music, it's not really my taste. And I don't like the way she shows off her skinny little body. It sends bad messages to little girls. But I do love her voice. I don't care who you are and what genre of music you are into, Christina Aguilera has an amazingly beautiful voice. She is talented. I have to give her credit for her vocial abilities."
4,Great CD,"I always thought that Christina was THE talented teen pop star of the 90's. She has matured greatly with this CD. A few tracks I could live without, but that is the case with almost every album ever made."
5,The rain of terror has ended!,"Britney, I hate you. Thanks to you, we have ""singers"" like Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, and Hilary Duff. Thanks to you, people who write a few words on their lyrics And ""play"" a guitar are considered deep (cough, cough, Avril). However, Britney did one good thing. She made Christina Aguilera look like a puppet. Christina got her revenge. She shocked the nation by stripping off all (or most) of her clothes and released a personal, mature and completely rockin' album. If you do not like her new image, don't be too skeptical as her CD is not quite so raunchy (some tracks are a little innapropriate for the twelve and under group). But hey, she's a heck of a lot more appropriate than Eminem, who, by the way, is what your twelve year old is probably listening to at this very moment. In conclusion, ""Stripped"" worthy of purchasing (heck, the pictures in the booklet are worth thirteen bucks). ""Fighter"" should be dedicated to Britney."
4,SOUNDS GOOD,"OK I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ALBUM. THIS ALBUM IS MORE MATURE, SEXIER, AND MORE ALL GROWN UP. A FEW SONGS STAND OUT LIKE THE SONGS BEAUTIFUL, LOVING ME 4 ME, SOAR, AND FIGHTER. i LIKE IT BECAUSE IT HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO IT LIKE POP, R&B,HIP-HOP, JAZZ,SOUL, BLUES, ROCK, AND EVEN GOSPEL FLAVORED LIKE THE SONG KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG. SONGS LIKE DIRRTY ITS OK, BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN IT FOR A FIRST SINGLE, cAN'T HOLD US DOWN IS TIGHT BUT LIL KIM'S RAP IS LAZY AND ANNOYS ME. MOST OF THE TIME I DON'T LISTEN TO POP STARS, BUT I HAVE TO SAY ITS A GREAT ALBUM AND ITS DIFFENT THAN THE OTHER ALBUMS OUT THERE."
5,She's got the vocals!,I hesitantly bought this CD hoping for at least 4 songs that I would like. What I received was a goldmine of songs where each song has become a favorite to me at some point in time since I bought it. I knew Christina had the vocal skills but wasn't really liking the whole pop teen generated music she had put out. This CD showcases her vocal abilities and has different genres of music all on 1 CD. I am truly glad I bought this cd and would recommend it to anybody...which is why I am writing this review. Excellent!
4,The New Christina...,"...Is awesome! Even though I really miss her little bubblegum act ""Genie In A Bottle"", now she is totally hip! She used to be a Pop Princess! It's hard to beleive! Here's my favorite songs with 1 being the worst and 5 the best.* Fighter = 5* The Voice Within = 4.8* Dirrty = 5* Infatuation = 4.7* Beautiful = 5Rest Of The Songs* Get Mine, Get Yours = 4.2* I'm Ok = Haven't Heard This One Yet* Stripped Pt. 1 = 3.8* Stripped Pt. 2 = 3.7* Make Over = 3.5* I forget The Rest! (I didn't include the interludes)I can't wait for her next album!"
5,Impressing Album!,"I'm so impressed by how Christina decided to change her style and by how she uses her vocals on each song on this album with the strength of the voice she has as she belts out the songs with passion! The song, ""Fighter"", says it all as she sings her heart out as loudly as she can and you can just hear the strenght in her voice like never before on her first album, ""Christina Aguilera"". This is something that not all artists can accomplish, and it's just simply amazing to a hear a voice so beautiful on this type of record! The intro is just simply marvelous and breath-taking as she sings about finally being able to be who she is now rather than who she was in the first place! This album gets 5 stars! It's worth your money and it's worth the listen for those who are Christina Aguilera fans!"
5,Talk about a voice.......,Probably her best.........certainly better than most singers out there........hmmmm.......Britney who?!What a voice this one has.I'm sure you will enjoy this CD as much as the rest of the world does.Worth every penny!Can't wait to see ya Christina at Verizon Amphitheater 5/19/04!
5,Best of Christina,"This album allows Christina to show her true colors, without any hesitation. Her hits are bangin' from ""Dirrty,"" the heart pumping thrill ride to ""Beautiful,"" the wonderfully titled self-esteem ballad that should bring tears to all eyes. Christina has grown up and ""Stripped"" shows her maturity. I hope her talent will continue to produce wonderful albums like ""Stripped"" in the future."
4,Christina is Back with Grit and the voice of an Angel,"This was the kind of CD that I had hoped for. Not a dance heavy soon to be forgotten relic. But true vocals that will speak to the soul. ""Chris"" is in fine form, with the chops that all the girl band wanna be's only dream of. And her guest's only add to the mix, like good friends chillin out over a bottle of wine. Alicia is so smooth, and Lil' Kim is tolerable on the opening cut. I just wish that another Diva by the the name of P!nk would have made an appearence :( All in All a great CD with a mix of soul, rock, and dance."
5,Christina Accomplishes Impossible and gets Dirrty,"Wow! Christina has created an amazing CD. After being silent for quite a while she has returned with a bang, smash, boom, kablaam! Anyone who has heard her first single Dirrty has heard the great beat, and who doesn't want to dance to that song? But Christina's CD isn't all dancing and getting a little ""unruly"", she has those sad times. Such as in the song ""I'm OK"" which is about her childhood.The one thing about this CD that I absolutely loves is the variety she has ""mean"" songs like ""Fighter"" to the fun collaberation with Lil' Kim ""Can't Hold Us Down,"" which is a little ladies anthem. She collaberates with people like Red man, Lil' Kim, and Alicia Keys.This CD starts off great and ends amazing. It's the greatest [money]I've spent in a long time and it has songs that will be remembered for quite a while. Christina is back and she's hear to stay!"
4,"I'm really shocked, but I really like it!","First off I am by no means a fan of hers but, I really like this album. I thought is was going to be bad or teeny bopper like her first one, but it isn't. I sat in my car when I got it and thought I would just listen to a few seconds of each song, but I ended up listening to the WHOLE thing. Talk about shuting my negativity up! All the songs are at least ok. Sure there are a couple I won't listen to often, but there aren't any I will NEVER listen to. The only reason I got it was because it was on sale and I thought at worse I'll give it to my 6 year old, but it's mine! I definetly recommend it. The songs are so full of meaning and she uses her voices full potential. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
3,You Ain't Stripped!,"I thought Christina Aguilera said that she's moved on from that bubble gum pop sound to her OWN sound? Obviously not because I hear so many songs that sound like Pink's and Mariah Carey's. One of Christina's interludes sound exactly like Mariah's. What is up with that ""Make Over"" song? I totally hated it. It sounded like something from the 70's and honey, this ain't the 70's. Aside from all that, she does have a nice voice and shows it on a lot of the ballads. I hate her music videos."
4,"Hey, I'm impressed","Every time I think of Christina Aguilera I think of Andy Dick's impression of her cousin's neighbor's daughter's friend.... I got hooked on ""Beautiful"" and didn't realize what depth CAguilar has in her voice. Very enjoyable, although I think she tries a little hard to fit into the hip-hop scene. She could sing any genre she wanted! I'll be keeping this one in the disc player along with Pink's Mizundastood."
3,X-Tina: Misleading Singles,"""Stripped"" by Christina Aguilera isn't as good as I had hoped. The singles, ""Infatuation"", ""Dirrty"", and ""Beautiful"" are really the only good songs. All of the other songs are whiny ballads about her hard times. It's great that she can talk/sing about them but I don't really care. If you are a true Christina fan, which i'm not, then you'll probably enjoy the album. But if you are looking for songs that match the upbeat dance feel of ""Dirrty"" and ""Come on Over Baby"", try Britney Spears."
1,Somebody Help Her!,"What was she thinking?! Here's the thing that really gets me! These teenage superstar's come out with this sweet candy bubblegum album, then it gets all sexed up! Then 4 years later, the're talking about boys, drinking, and you know what else. Nobody wants to listen to that!"
1,rather boring,"unfortunately i find this album rather boring. what is interesting in someone belting out ""dirty ,naughty"" etc. her voice is more screaming/belting than singing and the songs are rather weak. One song even sounds like a weak copy of the Sugababes first hit ""Ovaload"" (UK No.1). Christina really didn't ""grow up"" with this album...maybe the next one will do."
2,I don't like this cd that much.. I think I lose my money!,"Well, well.This is what I think. If you wanna have a good cd, I think this is not the most correct cd to buy.I bought this cd because I heard in a interview about her cd and I thouhgt this may be good, but I was a little wrong.The think was that... how she can said that if the people don't like her clothes and what she is wearing, they don't need to look at her? that's so wrong, I mean what about childrens who watch her, is not fear that they must see her appearing like that.If she wasn't such b%@#%$, well the people would put more attention about her real voice, because she has the voice, but not the personality..And how about the pearcings and the picture or Rolling Stone Magazine.What we show is what the people learn from us."
2,A Few Average Cuts and Way Too Long,"The good news is the Christina has a good voice, much better than her mumbling counterpart, Britney Spears. I don't own any other Christina album, so I can't compare it with her others The albums does have some good ballads, such as Beautiful but most of the songs are average or less. No need to discuss her radio hits, we all know them. These songs are disposible and will not stand the test of time.She spends way too much time on this album trying too prove she's a woman. She comes across more like a little girl crying for attention.And then we have the length of the album. It's too long. This explains why it's a weak album. Another reviewer said that 12 songs would have been enough. With less songs we can concentrate on the better ones. I felt exhausted after listening to it.This album isn't good enough to keep. Sorry X-Tina fans."
1,So this is how you get fans.......,OK CHRISTINA!!!!! YOU WANT FANS!!!!! SO SING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T STRIP DOWN IN A BLOODY SHOWER ROOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE MUSIC THEME???!!!
1,I hope God pulls her voicebox out to stop her from singing!,"After seeing the ""Dirrty"" music video, I decided that this girl should DIE! When she does I'm going to have a party that will last for a week. She was good before but then little tiny aliens creeped into her nose overnight and we got this! This girl is nothing but a chooch, a jerk, an idiot, a moron,a dunce,a b&%$# and an a@#. So all in all DO stay away from this CD."
1,nasty!,"this album was horrible! Britney is soooo much better. Christina is so talentless and this album proves her lack of talent. All she does on this album is b!tch and complain about her problems and all the vocals are horrible! She OVERSINGS everything and that ruins it. ""Im OK"" and ""Soar"" are the worst songs ive heard in my life."
3,Pop that Rox.,"Thinking back 2 the year of 1999 when this chick first came out in2 the public eye, she wuzn't very stable with her muzic/image. Remember the whole Britney/Christina competition that she lost due 2 not having the paradox that Britney had? Well, it'z been 5 yearz since that whole thing, and let me tell U, Christina has certainly come a LONG way from that: she has her own thing goin' on with her muzic and image. Just listen 2 her first CD and then this one-U'll see what I mean..."
1,Should Not Be Compared to Britney: BRITNEY'S BETTER!,"I was skipping through the channels one day and stumbled along the 'Dirrty' video. To put it simply I was digusted. Christina just followed Britney's example of maturing. People turned their noses up at the name Britney Spears. Yet, they can stand Christina? And the whole thing about role models!!! Well, Britney is MY role model while Christina is just a : She is a *, *, bimbo, unholy, harlot, hooker, hustler, a woman of ill repute, trollop, courtesan, and a hussy, prostitute,and baka!!Her songs are poorly written expect for a few have a good meaning such as Fighter and Beautiful (WOW! That is a surprise!). But her voice lacks and cracks. I know, my mom's friend is a voice teacher and we talked about her once.So, what do we do about this woman of ill repute romping around our children, ladies? We shout louder! NOT!! Women do not shout, we go outside the White House and picket!Christina just get out of town and terrorize my siblings."
5,She's back....,"I don't know what to say this is so beautiful,i'm not the fan of her but i realy like her voice,strong,smooth....Can't hold us down(feat lil'kim) 10/10Walk away 10/10Fighter 10/10infatuation 10/10loving me for me 7,5/10impossible(feat alicia keys) 10/10underrapercited 7/10beaytiful 10/10make over 5/10cruz 9/10soar 9/10Get mine,get yours 10/10dirrty 2/10a voice within 10/10i'm ok 10/10(keep on)singin my song 7/10"
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!,"I never liked her before, but when I bought this album and listened to it for the first time it was awsome!! You have to buy this album. It has 20 songs, and they are all about 3,4,5 or 6 minutes long. The cd is filled to the edge. She keeps it real, co-writes all of her songs (except for 2)and I have listened to this album at least 100 times. No joke. I LOVE IT! DEFINETLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,lyrically amazing,"There was once a time where Christina Aguilera's music would be compared to that of Britney Spears, after hearing this album it is obvious that there is no competition, Christina is undoubtably the winner! ""Stripped"" is a somewhat masterpiece! It makes us wonder why she spent so long promoting a false image and releasing songs such as ""Genie In A Bottle"" and ""What A Girl Wants"". This album shines! It shows the real Christina; In each and every song you can somewhat relate! Lyricially amazing i think is the term!There are some truly brillant songs on this album!"
5,Excellent Album!,"Like many others, when Christina first arrived, I didn't give her much of a chance. I liked ""Genie in a Bottle,"" but didn't think she would do much past that. After all, there was already a Britney Spears on the scene. However, Christina has something that Britney doesn't, the ability to actually sing. So, I took a second listen to her, and realized that underneath the ""pop"" sound was a voice screaming for freedom.In ""Stripped,"" Christina really breaks free of the pop realm. She's soulful, beautiful, and brings life to each song she sings. From ""Walk Away"" to ""Beautiful"" she brings the ballads to life, however keeps the tempo up with ""Dirrty"" and ""Infatuation.""Even if you are turned off by Christina's fashion style or previous pop music, give this album a chance. You won't be disappointed."
5,"POWERFUL VOICE, GREAT SONGS","this album is her best!! her powerful voice REALLY shows through a lot better than from her previous more bubblegum pop-ish albums. she really has a lot of talent and i love the fact that she wrote so many of the songs. the lyrics are also really meaningful.my favorites are ""the voice within""(beautiful ballad), ""dirrty""(a great dance song), and ""Walk Away"""
4,"Impressive! ""Loving Me for Me"" is worth the money alone","I liked her first album knew that she could ""blow"", but on this CD she has great lyrics and puts a lot of feeling into it, the dance songs are hot ""Dirty"" and It's definitely worth adding to your collection. There are so many songs that I like, but hands down ""Loving Me For Me"" is my favorite. I really hope this is released as a single and a video is done for it, it' a softer side a Christina, she's not oversinging on it and the music compliments her voice very well. This CD is a bit long, but it's overall very nice."
5,Thank you Christina,"hey Christina hey you guys!I really love this record.I am from Germany and Christina is one of the biggest parts in my life!I hope she read this reviw because i just wanna say thank you Christina!Thank you for recording this record thank you for everything!maybe we eill meet us in tn years or so!i am now 14 and my biggest wish is to become a singer like you!everyone who heards me sing say:you are a good singer,for your age,it's amazing!so maybe when i don't stop to hope...!okay...maybe you (christina) or a manager or sth like this read this...it would be so amazing to hear sth from you!THANK YOUTHANK YOU THANK YOU!and this record is ""der absolute wahnsinn""!The songs i like most are:WALK AWAY,fighter!THANK YOU AGAIN!and to you gyus:buy this record!NOW AT THIS MOMENT!-ChristinaAguilera@web.de"
5,THIS MAKES ME WANT TO CRY,"I'm a total Christina fan, she's my idol, and this album ROCKS! Is make me want to cry! She's finally coming out of the mold. sHe's never been who she really wanted to be, and now she's finally expressing herself and what she wants to say. She had a ruff childhood, and thinking how far she came to get to where she is today is so inspirational. You can do what ever you want if you put your mind to it, and Christina is living proof. She's finally being herself, thru all the public critisem. Definatly this album is worth the money. Support Christina! She's worked so hard to get here! BUY THIS ALBUM"
5,Stripped,This cd is probably the best cd I have ever bought!!! I have had it for a while now and I never get tired of listening to it!!! Definately a good buy!!!!
2,It's ok,"I was expecting this album 2 be perfect, but unfortunately Aguilera slips up some. Don't get me wrong there are some good tracks and she has a good voice, but these songs just aren't that memorable!Plus I think she was going for originality on this record, when really, its not original at all!! ""Impossible"" sounds exactly like and a Alicia Keys song(mabe cuz she wrote it and prodiced it??) ""Dirrty"" is Christina's ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" and ""Beautiful"" is her ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" only Britney's songs are more first class. This is just Christina trying to act all mature. Sure all the critics will probably rave but this cd is not that good..."
5,It's time for Christina to get her props!,"This CD is incredible! It has been stuck in my stereo since I bought it! I like it more everytime I listen to it. Forget everything you have ever read or heard about Christina and listen to this CD. You will have an entirely different opinion and won't be able to put it down! This girl can sing! My personal favorites are ""Walk Away"" and ""Fighter"". This CD truly shows how versatile Christina is and how truly talented! Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Best CD of the Year,"Christina Aguilera is a talent that can never be reproduced. ""Stripped"" is definitely the raw emotional outpouring of this 21 year old. Hands down this is the best album of the year. Why? I can't put the cd down. Powerful Vocals, Dynamic Writing, and the best production I've heard in awhile make this my number one choice. ""Stripped"" has a smooth evolution that takes you high and low. Linda Perry and Christina score a hit with ""Beautiful"".""Loving Me 4 Me"" brings Christina to the status of legends such as Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and Ella Fitzgerald. Its mellow, smooth, and has the vocal stylings of someone well beyond 21 years. ""Make Over"" is the only song that I have problems with. She's yelling. Yeah she has great range, but she's no rock star. Overall ""Stripped"" is one for the record collection. No longer will Christina be called a manufactured Pop Star, but a dynamic and poignant figure of music."
5,Amazing Talent!!,"Ok, I have her first CD with the whole ""Genie in a Bottle"" and I didn't really like too much of the rest of the CD. But THIS CD is wow! I can't beleive how good she is. I agree with another rating buddy that it's not about her looks, which, she needs help, but regardless the gurl can SING. I love this album! Go buy it and jam."
4,much better than i had anticipated,"not being too fond of the pop music that's been coming out lately, i wasn't too sure what to think of the new christina. yeah, i knew she had an amazing voice, her songs were good enough, especially compared to all the other radio pop, but she was still one of those mouseketeers. with all that in mind, i approached this one delicately. and i can honestly say that i'm quite impressed with it. she's matured quite a bit since her last cd. and apparently decided to get some personal stuff off of her chest. i may not be too fond of her image lately, but she does appear to be showing the real christina on this cd, and it's not at all as bad as you may be thinking. you may like it, you may hate it, but i'm sure that along the way you'll find something truly great about it. just give it a chance. she's worked hard enough for that."
4,"Aguilera shines on ""Stripped""","Forget about her ultra-sexy clothes or new trampy image. Aguilera has a superb voice and works with many styles on her latest, from old-school R&B to hip hop and smooth soul. Standouts include the duet with Lil' Kim, ""Can't Hold Us Down,"" the Latin-tinged ""Infatuation"" and the beautiful ballad ""Loving Me 4 Me,"" on which she sounds like a cross between Mariah Carey and the late Minnie Riperton. Also look for the hard-edged rocker ""Fighter."" The first-released single ""Dirrty"" really is no representation of the album. It's a bit too overproduced and doesn't really allow Aguilera's voice to do its work as her vocals are drowned out by too many sirens and beats. Aguilera really proves she has a great multi-octave vocal range on ""Stripped."" She totally eclipses Britney and the teenybopper image with this one."
5,GREAT!!!,This CD is great....all the songs are awesome. Christina really tells it how it is in this CD if you are looking for some good music to listen to this CD is one for sure.
5,great effort from christina,"when I first heard Dirrty I really loved the beat and knew I had to get the CD, and it confirmed even further that christina is NOT in the same category as britney spears at all musically, lyrically and vocally. I bought the album and the result was a musical diverse album that is mostly r&b and hip hop with sophisticated songwriting christina had a big part in, and also hints of rock, jazz and beautiful piano ballads, as well as memorable piano and guitar hooks throughout the record. I'm not usually into r&b music by newer artists but this album was an exception and is definitely recommended."
5,A troubled girl with talent,"I hate her new look and i think she is a bad example of what girls should be. But this is one of th best albums that I have. She is one of very little in the music industry that can actually sing. Her vocal range is oustanding, and I can compare her to what Whitney Houston used to be. Even though her dress and style (stinks), her talent is amazing. I think everyone should have this album in there collection."
4,"Beautiful Voice, Too Stripped Of An Image","Christina Aguilera shows off her beautiful voice in this CD (as her other previous CDs). I found most of the songs really good. I thought it was definitely more soulful. However, while I love her voice, I'll have to admit that her ""new"" image brings down the album. She may be stripped in ways that she describes, but the term ""strip"" becomes so literal. A beautiful voice must be a presented with a beautiful image. I respect her music and everything, but she's just way too stripped for her own good."
5,Unexpectedly Awesome,"I have to say...I was skeptical about this CD but after reading other people's recommedations, I bought it....and it's Awesome!! This woman has the most incredible voice...and the songs are great. I was never a Christina fan, but I am now."
3,Very talented but not what I was expecting.,"I loved Christina's first CD and waited anxiously for her next to be released. She's extremely talented, but I have to admit that I was disappointed with this new one. The music industry called it ""gritty"", I'd call it dark and depressing. The lyrics are full of angst which I guess is the popular thing right now, the ""....I've struggled so much and been so mistreated"" theme is something you hear a lot of these days in the music industry. I realize artists have to work very hard in this competitive industry but they all live very privileged lives and are fortunate enough to make millions of dollars doing something they love to do. Let's hear something uplifting!"
3,Eh...somewhat average...,"I don't know. I know the Christina was trying to break away from her bubblegum pop image, but I think she just placed herself back into Britney's shadow trying to be different and more adult with this cd. I found the first 10 tracks uninpsiring and boring actually. The songs don't seem to stand out till you get to the 11th. And even then, there are only 4-5 songs that sound great from the last few tracks remaining. Christina has talent, no doubt. Her voice is the reason why I prefer her to Britney, but the songs don't do her voice justice. I don't like Pink, but I'll admit that her compilation of varied song styles make a much better album purchase than Christina's Stripped."
1,Pure garbage!,"I can't understand why people choose to buy and listen to this garbage. Maybe in her own way, Christina has a good voice, but frankly, I can't stand her voice. She has no vocal control at all and spends more time shouting and over singing to the point that it hurts the ears. The endless and needless embellishments and trillings are enough to make my skin crawl. Her performance on the Grammys was so nauseating that I had to turn the channel. As for the album, it is full of stupid songs with no substance starting with the trashy 'Dirrty' song and the equally annoying 'The Voice Within'. As long as the teeny boppers keep on buying this garbage, Christina won't 'go away' like I wish she would. Her trashy image and the way she has marketed herself are the only reasons she has lasted this long. What will it take to encourage people to buy music by artists who can actually sing. Enough already of the Christinas and the Britneys not to mention the Shanias, Kylies and Avrils out there!"
