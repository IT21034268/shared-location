2,too wimpy,"Despite the rave reviews here, I have to cast a different vote. It may work well for leisure snorkelling, but it's too wimpy for regular pool workout."
2,Size problem,Fins not fitting since larger than stated and Amazons return policy (needs change)requires return shipping cost paid by consumer. Not worth returning! Wasted money!
4,U.S. Divers Proflex II Diving Fins,"We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica. We were very happy with the US Divers product. The price was right and the fins worked just as expected. They worked just as good as sets we have rented. Rather than renting fins at the beach, we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean."
2,Very tough to swim with for a novice,I have used these with slipper socks and I find them very hard to swim with as the blades are much too long for me. I use them only once or twice a year so I am not a big user and perhaps these were ment for a very active swimmer who is a lot stronger and more experenced then I. I think I'll be looking for something maybe half the length that will not be so tough on my legs and ankles. I wish I had more advise before I bought these.
5,Good deal,"Great deal, good quality materials used. The rubber part you put your foot in does not chafe because, although it looks like rubber, it is in fact silicone and is very soft.These fins are a bit too flexible for my tastes, but I'll definitely hang on to these.Oh, and I am mens shoe size 11 and the X-Large fits Great."
4,Great fins for the price!,"You can't get better fins for the price... if you're looking for top of the line fins, then you need to spend a lot more money, but these fins are great for what they are.... i travel with them... i've snorkeled and dove with them... (although i think they are a bit better at snorkeling)... they have worked great on every trip."
4,Great fins for water fun!,"I purchased these fins for a diving/snorkeling vacation in Belize. They performed as expected and got me where I needed to go! After a full week of diving/snorkeling, my feet had gotten a bit raw in spots but that is due in part to sand getting caught in the pocket also. I think for longer vacations I will have a setup that includes neoprene booties to protect my feet better but for shorter trips and general playing these fins do an excellent job for the price!"
5,Loved Them,"I bought these for a recent vacation to Hawaii. I used them 5 times over the course of the week and really liked them. They were very comfortable, and I felt like they worked very well. Having only used rental flippers before, I was amazed at how much lighter these are. I also love the cut-out in them. I'm sure it's designed for water-flow, but it actually made for extremely convenience handles as well. Well worth the price I paid for them."
2,axiom x3 the product,"I bought this product from Amazon thru a third party. I had no problems with the seller of this item infact he went over and beyond what was required as a seller to resolve a situation that i consider now a product problem and not a vendor problem. The main problem is that the backup battery ( the internal battery) fails after a certain amount of time. This has happened on 3 different x3s so it is not a fluke. When the backup battery fails and u remove the main battery to switch it out, all your data and items will be lost. If i were the next buyer i would not reccommend the x3 instead get the x51 which has no backup battery. The product will work as intended when the battery is left in and never removed or let expire. In closing Id like to thank Neil at NJ Closeout for the excellent service and recommendation about the item."
4,Great Even After a Month in Europe,"I bought this bag to keep my iPad and DSLR safe on a very fast paced, month long trip across Europe I recently took. The bag still looks brand new, minus a few little scuffs. Never gave me any problems, and a lot of peace of mind. It would be nice if the locking mechanism was easier to use, however I cannot think of way to actually accomplish that. Great bag, great protection, great security, well worth the trade off in weight. Recommended if you need a secure bag."
1,BUTTERFLY NEEDS TO FLY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL CD,"Butterfly,a good song with good beats makes you want to purchase this album hoping there might be other songs with the same type of groove,isnt happenin.Save yourself some money and buy the single, Crazy Town ,must be located somewhere in one hit wonderville."
4,crazy town yeeeeeeah,"fans of heavy metal get this buy some valium, tylenox whatever get you high turn the volumne up to 29 bang your head, make love do whatever scream, and ball like armageddon 2009. yeeeeeeeeeeeeah"
5,King of Bachmania !,"Tal has the same problem most Canadian musicians have. That being, for some unexplained phenomenon the US doesn't fully embrace music from North of the border.Give it a try. Tal's sound has been compared to the Beatles & ELO. Although, I would say his music is his own. Very melodic & catchy with a wide appeal across age groups."
5,Great Album from a talented artist!,Tal is great. He is just so flexible in his music. Something for everyone. Fabulous heartfelt music. Has become one of my favorites.
1,AN ABSOLUTE DISSAPOINTMENT - I READ THE REVIEWS HERE & BOUGHT THIS TO BE UNHAPPILY SURPRISED,"Tal Bachman/Tal Bachman 1999 album was my favorite album that year. His knack for writing great melodies (I.E. E.L.O., Lennnon/McCartney) shone through. This album lacks everything. Even the production is lacking, sounding odd and unfinished. his voice is also forced on most songs. BAD, BAD album."
4,Tal Bachman yes!,"This album is incredible. I simply cannot do it justice as a reviewer because I lack the intelligence and critical skills necessary to give a beautiful take on why this album is fantastic.Trying to write a review of this album would be like getting a crystal meth influenced Prime Minister Paul Martin to write a poem in Gaellic about what Judith Butler's back looks like, or having 10 clones of Bill Cosby perform neuro-surgery on a Care Bear even though they're just cartoons and/or plush representations of cartoons: these people are just not in a position to effectively accomplish their respective tasks.It's the same thing with me and this album.Also, I just read the Koran and it really helped me understand more fully the works of Michael Crichton which in turn helped me develop a greater appreciation of Tal Bachman's artistic work.In addition to this I also recommend _Congo_ by Michael Crichton, and _The Koran_ by Anonymous."
2,"repetitive, dissapointed","I was ecstatic of Tal Bachman's follow up to his debut. After countless listens to his first album, I still do not find it repetitive or overplayed.Unfortunately, after just one listen of Staring Down the Sun, this album simply dissapointed me. From the repetitive and predictable distorted guitar riffs to Tal keeping in the lower octaves of his vocals, I was not getting into the music. Not to mention, all of the tracks are overproduced and layered in too many intramental tracks. No ambient nor moving guitar solos here.I wish Tal would return to displaying his vacal range and the more simple nature of his debut album."
4,a good complement,"I have several strategies going in order to stay away from taking patent prescription medicines for my diabetes. I think that this product is probably a good complement to my other vitamins/minerals/herbs.For my diabetes I use:Albion Chelated Vanadium 5 Mg (this product) (1 per day)Fenugreek Seed 610 Mg (2-4 per day)Chromium Picolinate 200 Mcg (1 per day)Informulab's Beta Fast GXR Glucose Balance (2 per day)Of course I have a multi-vitamin, multi-mineral, etc.Another thing that works for my energy level is Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and their Amino Acids.With a decent diet and some exercise, my diabetes in under control. NO doctor pills!"
5,Chelated Vanadium,Reliable supplements at great prices from Swanson. Arrived fast as promised. Would buy again.
1,This product does contain soybeans.,"Reading along product description, it sounds really great, and it's recommended by a doctor. Pharmaceutical grade means consistency - high potency, detailed quality control, etc. However, on its label in fine print under Supplement Facts are those fateful words for so many, ""Contains soybeans."" I wish ALL ingredients were listed on product description of ALL supplements that amazon.com sells."
5,journalism at its best,"Excellent and thorough book about the terrible tragedy in England. Not to be missed for the true crime buff. The boys who killed were children and the story is basically unbelieveable, but it DID happen and will probably happen again given the same circumstances of the parents lifestyles and ""two of a kind"" together at the right (wrong) time and the right (wrong) place."
4,she was a lier,"Joan Crawford was not a nice person in real life so when she plays the part of a evil person she is perfect at it. She knows just how to do it.In this movie she is a liar & a user, she controls her husband & her cousin. And she treats the help like they are total low life. The house keeper had been with the husband for many years before he married Joan.When her husband is being sent to Japan by his boss, she doesn't want him to go even tho he is really happy about it so she goes to his boss & tells him all lies about her husband. The boss believes everything she saids so he tells the husband that he has changed his mind & that now he isn't going. Of course the husband can not figure out what happened so he starts asking questions. You must see the movie to find out the ending of this movie. very good."
1,WRONG SIZE,They sent the wrong size and now need me to return the child size they sent. I won't have it in time...don't bother.
3,Wonder Woman,Well it definatly looks better on the model. The whole fit was boxy and shapeless. The skirt was over the knees. Not sassy at all.
2,Small is still too big,"I have never been an X-Small ,but rather a small or medium in costumes, shirts, dresses, etc. This was was too big in the chest (I'm a full D but I have a smaller back so maybe that is why it was so loose). It was also way too long for anyone not 6ft. The boot covers came in 2 different sizes and one was ripped. The only reason I didn't return this item was because I had no time to buy another one. I had to hand stitch the rips and take in the corset part."
4,Great Costume,"This costume fits great and goes right along with the size chart. It is a little short - if you are uncomfortable with mini skirts, you may not like it. There was the bleeding on the boot covers and the stars stuck to the skirt, but that was mentioned and not too big of a deal since I got the 4 inch platform boots to wear with the costume instead. I got a lot of compliments on this one - love it!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"SKIRT FADED AFTER ONE WEAR, DIDN""T EVEN WASH IT YET AND IT WAS UNWEARABLE NOT EVEN A COMPLETE USE ONE TIME."
1,Sizes Does NOT MATCH...,Sizes do not match ... at all if you wear a small..... do not get this .. it is like 20 sizes to big!!
4,Great Costume,Almost exactly as shown. Fit great but gauntlets/headband kind of cheesy (not metal like they should be). Otherwise great costume!
4,wonder woman costume,"This is a one-piece outfit, the top fits very well, but the skirt is way too big, like a balloon. I will have to get it altered. Overall am satisfied with the description of what was included."
2,Great Costume Bad Vendor,"When I received this costume the first time, the bag was ripped opened. The white part of the boot covers were stained red and the accessories like the belt, wrist bands and crown were not sewn or the Velcro part was loose. The main costume was stretched out. I called and waited a week for it to be replaced. The second replacement was a little better but the boots were still stained and this time the belt was missing. At this point since I needed the costume that week, I called and requested the belt to be shipped which they did. I would not get a costume from this vendor unless you plan to get something damaged, It looks to me that they store their costumes in hot storage areas causing the colors to bleed example the boot covers. Also the costume itself runs pretty big. I ordered a medium and I am a size 10, should have ordered a small. But, it is a nice looking costume you should get but from another reliable vendor not this one."
4,One tough costume,"I used the costume to run Warrior Dash in (A 5k with obstacles) And it held up well through the water and mud. Just in general though, (pre mud/water), the red/white knee highs don't stay up to well on their own and tore at the seams easily, even when only putting them on. And it's a little to big on top for small chests, I was constantly adjusting it, but most strapless things don't fit me well anyhow. I was going to add straps but just ended up safety pinning it to my bra. (I got the small and am 5'4, 125lbs). I washed the costume after and it held up decently in the washer, hung dry though. Everyone LOVED the costume!"
3,REALLY SHORT/a hassle to wear,"Im a 20 year old and I wear a size 12 and the medium fit me almost perfectly...I tried on this costume at a local Party City, and was disappointed by the length of the dress, though you could probably wear leggings and feel fine. I was also finding myself tugging and pulling at all the different parts of the costume..which was a deal breaker :/ Super cute, but I prefer a costume I can feel comfortable in and not feel like I'm constantly fixing my clothes."
2,"Runs bigger than the normal ""big""","I ordered this in a medium after reading the reviews to but smaller. I'm 5'3 and 155 and was initially going to get a large. The medium is still too big! I will have to have the top altered. The skirt is longer than what I expected but I'm OK with that since I'm a mom and this is what my son picked out for me to wear on Halloween (he's flash, his brother superman, and his dad green lantern). However the skirt also has too much fabric and is bulky and frumpy looking. If I was going to be wearing this ""out out"" I would recommend buying the nice boots. The covers are hideous but they'll due for simple trick or treating. So if your normally a Large, I'd buy a Small!"
3,"Foam, size small fits 8/10, NOT washable","The older version of this costume had a lot of elastic in the back for tighter fit/more stretch. The newer version that ships now has a zipper down the back and even though it is the same size small as the older version, the newer version fits much looser. The size small with the zipper would best fit a woman who wear size 8/10, whereas the older version size small would best bit size 4/6. It's a sign of the state of this nation of obesity when sizing starts becoming more vanity sizing than accurate. :/The older version boot covers are the ones shown...a shiny material similar to the skirt fabric. The new ones are stretchy velvet like the bustier.Please note the inside of the bustier is unlined and there is gray foam...kinda hot and itchy. This costume is NOT washable, only spot treatment. Too bad."
4,Just what I expected!!,"The color was perfect, the size just right. I made some minor adjustments of course but it definitely met my expectations and looks great on me. Only thing I would add if I were the company is a hook-and-eye at the top of the zipper--it held the top so much better. But that's an easy fix anyway."
3,good quality dress but acessories no so much....,"DC Comics Deluxe Wonder Women Adult Costume is ""OK"" dress & Cape are nice quality but boot covers ripped while trying on and star logo on headband was already rubbed off upon opening the package. I would not be deterred from ordering this costume because you can replace the accessories with better ones online. My suggestion: Order the Wonder Women wig and platform boots to really make this costume awesome. This costume does run BIG I am between a size 7-8 and a small fit good could probably have ordered an xs. Over all I can't wait to wear the costume on Halloween. IMO the wig is awesome! Very soft and bouncy! If you don't have ""wonder women"" hair naturally get the wig from 7th Ave Store online. The wig comes packaged in a box not a bag! They had fast shipping too."
2,Terrible fit,"This costume starts off with good intentions, but fails miserably at execution. First, as every review says - BEWARE THE BOOT TOPS! They are horrible! No way on this earth the picture is even remotely like the junk they send. They had a giant tear before I even put them on and they are pure garbage. Take them out of your mind when ordering this. Secondly, the costume is just not flattering. I am 5'10"" and 150lbs, with 36DD, so the size small should have been snug and fit well. The top made me look horribly wide and frumpy and the skirt is way too long to be flattering. The look is nice, but the fit is awful. I never expected a custom fit with good quality material, but the discrepancy between what the picture shows and what I got is huge. It's just not that nice...... I am hoping that some creative stitching will make this costume wearable, but I don't see it happening...."
1,These reviews look suspicious,"At first, I was impressed by the reviews. Then I got suspicious as they all sounded similar and every single review had 5 stars and a perfect ""found helpful"" rating. Every reviewer but one has reviewed only one book - this one. I think I'll pass on this book and buy one with a greater variety of authentic-sounding reviews."
5,I love this cookbook!,"I found the recipes very easy to follow. Not everyone in my family is vegan, but the recipes were so delicious, I could prepare them for the whole family! The kids were so happy - I even involved them in the preparation. The pictures are beautiful, and I found all the recommendations accurate. I will use this cookbook alot! Great ideas and beautiful presentation."
5,A delicious Vegan cookbook. Finally.,"Finally a vegan cook book with recipes that taste better than eating the book itself. I've bought a lot and used a lot but this book is so simple and thoughtful with great recipes, easy to follow that culminate in a great meal. My whole family thanks you."
4,As advertised,"This is a book in the series ""Materials for inspirational design"" and that pretty much says it all. This is a book on industrial design written for designers: beautifully printed and bound, in glorious color. Its strengths are also its weaknesses. The 'functional white space' is on the verge of being overwhelming, especially in the part that is supposed to give technical information. The definition of ""wood"" is a designer's and includes bamboo, coconut fibres, ply and various wood derivatives. For actual information on wood the reader had better turn elswehere. As a book to show possibilities and to inspire previously unthought-of uses of wood, this will do fine."
2,Pretty Pictures,"Not a very enriching book. Got it in the mail, looked at the small detailed photos that covered a spread and felt like this wasn't worth the paper it was printed on."
3,A See-Saw of a Book,"As a group, the nine essays and introduction which comprise this book irritated me profoundly. As a former editor and academic teacher, I was simply affronted by the uneven quality of the contributions: a couple were superb; several were above average; a couple were ok but not outstanding; and the remainder would rate from poor to absymally awful. Since the editor, as her introduction and the apparatus of the book shows, is a competent scholar, it is difficult to understand why she exercised no more control over the quality of the contents. Leaving that aside, and to avoid making some really odious comments on individual essays, I would particularly recommend to readers the articles by Barbara M. Benedict, ""Sensibility by the Numbers: Austen's Work as Regency Popular Fiction,"" and Susan Fraiman, ""Jane Austen and Edward Said: Gender, Culture, and Imperialism,"" which in themselves make the purchase of Janeites worthwhile."
5,A Must Have Book!,I studied with Tony for a couple of months to get things going back in 83? I must say I had the book but it wasn't until I studied with Tony that I understood how important the beginning exercises are. I Overlooked them because they were simple... big mistake. There are subtleties to the right hand position that Tony uses. It is not easy to describe with words in a book. I think Tony should consider a Youtube demo of the technique and use it as an advertisement.Anyway do the beginning exercises using a metronome in the 40's and get clean strikes with a full sound. This was Tony's first lesson. I resisted inside but took his advice and never regretted it(thanks Tony). Precision in the beginning will payoff later.Enjoy
5,Great. Catchy Tunes. Good exercise.,"After having learned the fundamentals of technique usingThe Slap Bass Program, I needed exercise material. This has it in spades. The exercises are catchy and challenging. However, you might want to ignore the pictures showing the technique. Sklarevski's technique in the Slap Bass Program looks more solid and comfortable."
3,Informative,The beginning excercises did help me in building up to a decent playing level. Unfortunately most of the grooves are a bit repetitive and complicated. IMO the best grooves are usually the simpler ones that people remember.
4,The Umbrella,Jan Brett captures the reader with a lovely story and her delightful artwork. She never disappoints her readers young and old. I teach second grade and used the book with a rainforest unit and the students loved it
4,Great Jan Brett Rainforest Theme,"Who cannot love a Jan Brett book? I've always thought her illustrations were fantastic and this book is no exception.The Umbrella is a wonderful story set in the rainforest. Young Carlos goes off to search for animals in the rainforest. He brings with him his umbrella, which he leaves at the bottom of a fig tree as he begins to climb it.Unbeknownst (is that a word?) to him, all the animals end up congregating in his umbrella at the bottom of the tree.It is a great book to read for any rainforest theme. My daughter liked learning and remembering the names of the rainforest animals. I actually bought it for use in my kindergarten classroom and it is a staple. The kids want to hear it over and over again.While this is not my favorite Jan Brett book, it is a good one!"
5,Umbrella by Jan Brett,I love Jan Brett books. This one I bought for a grandchild. He loved all the colorful animals of the rain forest. Even the somewhat older grandkids had to see it.The Umbrella
5,decent quality,"Waterloo has a large selection of toolbox sizes, this one was perfect for my wood turning tools. I have Waterloo tool boxes that are more than thirty years old that still look and work great."
3,Maid in china what?,"Thin metal box, red, thin metal tray, handle, medium / light duty latches, and made in china stickers. I was looking for a made in usa tool box, next time."
4,"Good product, reasonably priced","I would give 5 stars if I didn't have problems with it smudging/running a little bit. Otherwise, I love it! It goes on smoothly, and easily, and for the price, is an excellent value."
5,"The truth, pure and simple","William Engdahl's account is so starkly honest that it's almost disarming, if it weren't for the frightening truths he reveals. My only criticism concerns the book's editing, where redundancies sometimes lessen the author's point instead of emphasizing it. But point he makes, and devastatingly so. Any literate and concerned American should read this volume."
1,not worth the time,"I find it odd that some of the reviews here praise the book for being well-documented, because in the 60 or so pages I've read so far it has no documentation or support whatsoever for some pretty wild claims. I had high hopes when I picked this up at the library because it is an interesting topic, but now I find it impossible to take it seriously."
5,A must read....,"It's very important for the common citizen to understand the mechanics and to be able to read between the lines in order to decode the geopolitical events taking place around us in the world.Certain people in the U.S. power establishment do not put world peace very high on their agenda, so it's up to us to mobilize against this.A good way to be able to understand the underlying motives in U.S foreign politics is to digest what Mr. Engdahl is spilling out for us here.This book is a must read."
5,This explains it all.,"It is imperative that the US and British people no longer be in the dark. A very few powerful people and organizations have controlled us and the world too long. It is critical that we understand this deceit and this book gives researched, detailed account. The manipulation is outrageous and angering but the more that read and understands the contents of this book; the sooner the people of the entire planet will be able to change their Orwellian future."
5,In summary,"To summarize the excellent review by ""E. P. Walter:"" The world is now dependent on access to affordable petroleum for continuance of our standard of living. We are not willing to reduce our standard of living. Access to the petroleum that will maintain our standards of living requires that we make deals with the Devil. We are making those deals."
2,Caveat Emptor,"While Engdahl has an impressive grasp of wider geopolitics, be warned. His conclusions can be extrememly flaky to say the least, and are rarely backed up by the facts he presents.President Harding was assainated by British spies working for Shell...interesting, or occupation of the Ruhr and the subsequent hyperinflation of the Weimar republic (as a result of plots by british spies, if you believe his heavy implications) was ""a horror to which few nations before or since have been subjected"". Coming from a german i find that a bit rich.Conspiracies theories abound. If you're looking for a fresh take on the subject of oil's role in world politics, then there are interesting themes to independently pursue, but take it all with a hefty pinch of salt."
5,Beautiful and emotional!,"I just got this CD as a birthday gift, just today. I have also seen the entire Haibane-Renmei DVD series! The music on the DVD series, and on the CD, is beautiful and emotional. I don't know why, but some of the songs bring me close to crying (and I don't cry easily!). I will cherish this CD, and listen to it many times! I recommend it to anyone, whether they've seen the DVD series or not. (Note: The CD comes with a small booklet that features an interview with the composer, and lyrics to ""Wondering"" and ""LOVE WILL LIGHT THE WAY"")."
3,It aint quite Quicksand...but it aint terrible,"Decent record, enjoyable, but nothing as good as manic compression or slip. I am sure I will be blasted with numerous messages citing that Rival Schools are not Quicksand. All I am getting at is that I would have rather been treated to another Quicksand record than a Rival Schools record. Pick it up used...or save your money for manic compression. Heck maybe after repeated lisstens I will be singing the choir of Rival Schools."
2,Doesn't stand out.,"Reading reviews, I've learned that every band has a select few fans that will laud each album as the greatest musical achievement since the dawn of time. I know I've got my couple bands that I'll never abandon, but Rival Schools (or any Walter Shreifels project) will never be one of those for me. The album has a couple engaging songs (Undercovers On, Good Things). The tracks vary from mellow to hard hitting, and some do a good job of progressing from a whisper to a scream. But there's more energy than talent put into this album.Just don't expect any creative playing. Shreifels, Love, and Tolman just beat their guitars harder than the drummer. This album mostly goes to show that anyone with distortion pedal and a raspy voice can record an album. Perhaps the number and price of the ""used and new"" copies available is the most telling information on this page."
2,You could write this book,"The theme is low-cost style and, sure enough, the ten houses featured, many if not most of them renovations, show some examples of this. The problem is, the accompanying text adds nothing--e.g. lower your home cost by eliminating the basement. Isn't this obvious? There's very little information in here, and what there is reveals only a vague understanding of how houses are built and what things cost."
1,Just pictures- no practical advice.,"Don't expect any practical advice from this book on how to limit your building costs. It is just a lot of pictures of contemporary styled homes showcasing the use of concrete, steel and plywood."
3,the size is highly inaccurate,"These shorts look ok. I bought two but returned immediately -- because the size is so inaccurate. Usually i wear 33/30 or 32/30pants, so i thought 34/30 would be just fine. Big mistake. Thewaist is too tight to wear. This ruined an otherwise good product."
3,Golson Meets the Rhythm Section,"With a line-up like this, how could you go wrong? Golson Meets the Rhythm Section. Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, the pleasant but inconsequential music herein disappoints expectations, with only an exceedingly catchy rendition of ""Three Little Words"" a standout. More to the point, this album is available on the less expensive two-fer entitled Benny Golson with Wynton Kelly and Tommy Flanagan, which pairs Turning Point with the much more stunning quartet album entitled Free, featuring Tommy Flanagan in the piano chair and one of drummer Art Taylor's best recorded performances. Look for it."
3,"Excellent product, incorrect accessory",This is an excellent range hood by BROAN. Well made and good looking. It deserved 5 stars. I deducted stars not because of issues with the item itself but (maybe unfairly)because the filters listed as accessories do not fit. I cannot for a minute understand why these to items would be associated.Wasting my time now to have to return it.
4,Looks great.,"This range hood looks great in my kitchen and works good. Was relatively easy to install, even for a woman. I did a lot of price shopping before I purchased this and feel I got the best price, but I still think the range hoods in general are overpriced, especially for the SS finish."
3,Fine for us,We needed a replacement range hood but did not want to spend a bundle. Fine for what we needed and it fits in our budget.
4,New stove; New Hood,I got a newstove and wanted a new range hood but they seemed to want so much for a simple range hood. So I found this one and was very happy with price. Broan is a good brand and this is a simple hood. I needed ductless and was and have been very happy with this. Nice light too
4,Good hood for the money,"Range hoods are so expensive. I was in sticker shock looking for a replacement to the one I had at the time. That is, until I found this one on Amazon. I couldn't believe its price. I ordered and got it. Mind you, it is an economy model. The fan is a bit loud. The edges are not exactly square, i.e., I can see a little gap between the hood and the cabinet to its left with the gap bigger at the bottom than the top. But, it works as advertised. The light works. The fan is strong. And, it looks good. People really don't notice the gap that I mentioned."
4,It fits the bill for how it looks in the kitchen.,I bought it for the looks. Nothing else.Have put a low wattage light in it to work as a nite lite.
3,shipped tented,The item was as advertised but dented from shipping. I don't know if the packing was enough to protect it. Not sure if its a shipper fault or the vendor. In either case I was taking it out of the country and needed it right away so I fixed it. I might add that Amazon had the best price and I shopped around a lot.
4,good basic range hood,"It was very inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting much and I was happy to see it is substantial. There isn't all that much power in the fan and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I mostly use it for the light, and the black metal finish looks nice in my kitchen."
5,Great Product,"We had been searching for a Stainless Vent Hood for some time, after searching several retailers, I was surprised and elated to find it on Amazon, best price, best offer, and does exactly what I want/need it to. Vent hood provides plenty of light and air circulation,noise factor is ok,not loud, but not quiet."
5,Bill,The item came quickly was packed so it would could not be damaged. Instructions for installation were very clear and was installed in 30 min. The rangrhooh looks great and works like a charm. I'm very happy with this purchase.
4,Good basic hood,"Great hood for the price. Fan is quite loud, but the build quilty and finish are fine."
3,"it does what i wanted, so....","exactly what i was looking for to replace a broken over-the-cooktop microwave. we have a micro on the countertop and when the other one broke I wanted to replace with a hoodfan. at local stores nobody had an el cheapo hoodfan in black --- they only had $200 ones and what a waste that would have been. so i bought this one and it was exactly what I expected it to be. However, keep in mind that as a functional fan it is nearly useless. It's loud and barely functions as a fan. I use it for light more than anything but it does sort of work to capture cooking smells. I just wanted something cheap to look nice and fill the space and give me light.If you're looking for a really good hoodfan this aint it. But if you just want something to fill that space and function well enough then you'll be happy."
4,Wise purchase,"I was very pleased with this product upon arrival. I was a little worried about the quality of appearance at that price, but its great! This is the same rangehood I looked at at two local stores but they wanted almost twice as much for it!I ordered the stainless steel and it is not cheap or tinny looking. It matches my stove just fine.It is not installed yet (my husband's job :)) so I can't comment on its operation but I do not forsee any problem in that area based on the previous reviews."
4,Good for the price,"The hood works ok and looks nice in stainless steel. For the price it is what I expected. I wasn't able to use the holes for mounting, since it didn't work with my cabinet above the hood. We just drilled new holes into the hood, but it wasn't a big deal."
3,3 stars only,The first one was damaged either prior to shipping or during shipping. It was not very well packaged and looked like something heavy was placed on top. That one was sent back. The second one was okay except the filter was all dented up. I do not think that could have happened during shipping because the hood itself was not damaged. Kinda hard to damage the filter without damaging the hood. I bent the filter back into some semblance of shape and used it anyway.
3,Fine,"It is the right price but it is not the same size as it says. We had the exact same one just a little older and this one was slightly smaller. 1/4"" on all sides."
5,Well made!,The product overall was great! I received it in about a week. I installed it and realized the fan was bad. It made a bad grinding sound. I just shot the customer service an email and the parts are on the way! I am super impressed with the product and the customer service! highly recommend !
5,this hood is so great for the price!,we really love this hood. it looks great with our lg oven and i imagine any stainless steel oven. the hood functions work just fine and it was easy to install. the only problem we had was the first hood we received was dented. amazon sent us a new hood and we sent the dented one back with free shipping from amazon. they handled it very well. overall we are very happy with the product and it's price!
4,serves its purpose,"i found what i needed for its purpose. the range hood blends in perfectly with the rest of my kitchen. the only negative thing i'd have to note is it is a bit noisy but for the price i paid that is to be expected otherwise, it really is perfect;)"
5,Kitchen range hood (white),It was easy to install this range hood where the old one was. The standard kitchen cabinets of 29 7/8 inches allow a nice fit for this range hood. The light over my new all white GE stove is perfect.
5,Broan Nu Tone Range Hood,"I love it! I also liked the price! I bought this Range Hood in the Black color to replace one that had been there for over 20 yrs. My husband had no problem installing it. The light is very bright, the fan a little noisier than my other one but its bearable. I would buy it again!"
2,i thought......,"pretty girls, but all you get to see is pretty girls.no .... , and no ..... , and yeah i was disapointed.even my buddies didn't like it very much."
2,very short and the real action is missing!,"After seeing NOVA: the day the earth shook, this is a real bummer. That's why I recommended the nova tape INSTEAD of this, read my NOVA review to know why.This video only contains news footage of the AFTERMATH of a Californian quake. No actual earthquake footage, just footage of the damages, for only a short 30 minutes. Interesting here and there, (so called earthquake safe highways, weren't earthquake resistent after all) but not worth the money, in my opinion."
5,taboo bike,grandaughter loved it very durable she is a tom boy of sorts so she really put it to the test chain did come off once but as I said she was tough on it I would still recomend it.
3,Not good for larger sizes,"I ordered a 38"" D based on a review from someone who said that this bra is good for larger sizes. Unfortunately, the back closure is only 2 hooks, which is just not enough for me. This bra is comfortable, but does not have enough support for me, so I have to return it. There is a $5.00 restocking fee on all returns with free shipping. So, in the end, I'll pay about 10$ just to return this bra."
4,Replaceing my beloved Microsoft Optical Trackball,Great little replacement for my Microsoft optical trackball. Works well I do wish the mouse was a bit larger. Very responsive and the transmiter fits in my Dell desktop and I can close the bay door. I would rater have a new Microsoft Optical Mouse but alas they quit making them a decade ago. Its the best trackball on the market.
5,awesome trackball,"this trackball is exactly as the seller described it, and works great. i love these microsoft trackballs because they fit my hand better than about any other trackball on the market"
2,Not a great trackball,"I'm literally shocked to see soo many good reviews on this trackball. I've owned mine for various years and have never loved it. The major problem is that the ball sticks. Period end of sentence. Sure it works fine for about a few minutes, maybe an hour or so but somehow it is designed it sticks and I'm not the first to mention so although I'm the first to mention so here.Forward back buttons work good and scrolling is fine but the ball sticking is a deal killer for me. I just blew 50 bucks on a new Logitech. I really wish there were more trackball options out there . . ."
2,Spun in the wind,"This seemed like it would work great when I first put it on the tree. It was easy to put on and when I tightened it, the tree straightened right up. But then, a strong gust of wind blew it and it spun to the other side of the tree. When I swung the arm back, the bark got ripped off. The tree will probably die.If you'd like to try this in a windy area, I recommend driving stakes into the ground on either side of the arm to block it from spinning."
2,RACHEL BLAKELY CREATES A SALE,"I BOUGHT THIS UNKNOWN MOVIE FOR ONE REASON: RACHEL BLAKELY. I HAVE HAD THE HOTS FOR HER SINCE SHE STARRED IN ""THE LOST WORLD."" I ONLY WATCHED THIS UNTIL HER FIRST SCENE, THEN I SHELVED IT. SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THIS MOVIE."
5,Rachel Blakely does it again!,This is a very enjoyable action/adventure story. It takes place on a cruise liner where two powers of state hold a sumit meeting to talk over peace negotiations. Terrorists take over the ship and hold everyone hostage. Rachel Blakely shines as a British officer who kicks some serious terrorist butt and helps to save the passengers of the endangered ship.
5,Rachel Blakely Shines in this Film,"Rachel Blakely, star of ""Neighbours, ""Tales of the South Seas"" and ""The Lost World"" brings many wonderful moments of charm, grace and action to this entertaining film."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I'm not really sure what music genre this guy fits under, but this CD was NOT what I expected. The price alone was crappy. The only reason I purchased this album was because it had the song ""He aint heavy...he's my brother."" Unfortunately this guy's version of that song doesn't do him much justice. Unless you know the style of Keith Barrow, I would recommend against purchasing this item."
2,Not as lengthy as advertised,"I spooled this onto a reel that holds 200 yards of 8 lbs test (Pflueger Patriarch 9540X - Spinning). Well the reel didn't even get filled properly before running out of line. The line itself casts good, but the 8 lb stretches like a rubber band, which may or may not be desirable, depending on your fishing situation."
2,Berkley Trilene,"Thought this would be a strong, dependable, line, but alas it was not. Will not buy this product in this size again."
4,Good fishing line,"Good fishing line, has a bit of memory, use different reels and the result is good, easy to make any kind of knot, which makes it easy to change hooks or lures."
4,"Good line, but not as tough as expected.","This is good product. Casts well and has low memory, just as advertised. However, I made a mistake of using it as a leader during drifting for steelhead from the bank. Not a good idea. It appears not as abrasion resistant as I had hoped and the knot strength wasn't that great either. Overall good value. I'm using this as a main line and attach a fluorocarbon leader - that works pretty well."
5,Excellent DVD from the King of Electronic Music,"I think Paul Van Dyk is the best of his Genre, and I recommend this package to fellow Trancers. However I must take this opportunity (at Paul Van Dyk's expense) to highly recommend Gartel's- Trance, Dance and Other Living things. Gartel is the ""Father of Digital Art"" and has put together a multi media, surround sound extravaganza that will blow the socks off any other product in the marketplace. Nobody can touch this guy. By Van Dyk, and Gartel, compare them, and let me know what you think."
5,Need More Like This One!!!,An awesome mix from the master. I originally bought it for the CD and thought the dvd was just gonna be some little freebie thing. Now I watch the DVD more than I listen to the CD. Have some friends over and pop the DVD in to have an awesome atmosphere. Highly recommend it for all PVD fans. BUY IT NOW!!!
1,Might as well be a CD with a booklet!,"I was looking forward to this DVD as it would be like going out to a club, but in your house! Don't be fooled by these PVD junkies, this DVD does not deliver and here's why: A huge disappointment to me and my friends, the music is not synched with the videos! They basically show videos of PVD performing in a club/arena/elsewhere and play his music from his CDs as opposed to playing the music from that performance.Basically, there's no energy or live feel to this dvd. If you want to see a rave or a club, get the Underworld DVD or go to one!"
4,Global DVD,"This DVD will no matter what be loved by PVD fans, it is is comprised of some of his lighter trance. I enjoyed the music a lot. However I honestly couldnt make it through 10 minutes of watching it becuase it is just clips from his parties across the world. I ended up cranking it up and just cleaning my house. Overall a good dvd to listen to for studying or background, but hard to watch it. I still reccomend it. I am a huge PVD fan."
2,Disco Trance,"I was hoping for hypnosis music. I anxiously put this CD on, only to find out I made a huge mistake in buying it.I was looking for music for relaxing to put into trance. This puts you in a foot stomping, finger tapping, dancing trance. Music all sounds like leftover disco music. Not what I was looking for. Guess I'll check into Reiki music. I got no use for this type of music."
1,Waste of money,"Still struggling through assembling the PowerTech EDU-8705 electronics kit I purchased for my nephew. This kit is for 10+ years old- You must be kidding! I have never seen such poorly written instructions, poor diagrams and basically a very CHEAP product. I take pity with the poor kids (and adults) who buy this kit. I'll stay away from Elenco products and suggest to others they do so as well. And by the way, with 20+ years experience in the Electronics industry as an engineer I still find this 'toy' very difficult to decipher!"
3,Not the best picture book on the topic,"Godfrey Groundhog predicts -- months ahead of time, and only on a hunch -- that he won't see his shadow and an early spring will ensue. Most of his friends celebrate the prospect of fewer weeks of winter. But Roland Raccoon runs a ski lodge, and he's not a happy camper at all. He sabotages Groundhog Day by kidnapping Godfrey. The groundhog eventually slips away, and Roland apologizes. Spring DOES come early, and Roland opens up a hot dog stand on the beach.Compared to other Groundhog Day picture books, this one's pretty weak. The characters and settings are too cartoony for my taste, and the thought that a raccoon would kidnap a groundhog is just too unbelievable, even for a children's book. See my Listmania list for other Groundhog Day recommendations."
5,Another great!,"I can't say enough about this CD. It's been in my CD player since I got it and ""it ain't comin' out for a while!"" Like Kerouac, Bob Martin has this uncanny ability to romanticize a life of hard times. It almost makes me want to stop working so hard to try to achieve the high life. People who are a product of hard times seem to have a lot of character! These stories are a tribute to that. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves a good story with a great tune."
3,"No HotSync button, but does the basics","It allows my Palm TX to HotSync data, and it provides a good base to charge it. In this, the cradle succeeds.The Palm sits a bit too vertical for my tastes, causing the protector flap to hang down at an odd angle. If left this way for a while, the flap stays in this strange-fold position.My biggest gripe with this cradle is the lack of a HotSync button! Instead, I have to open the HotSync application on the Palm and start the process manually."
3,What's to review?,"Amazon sent me an email asking me to review this purchase. It's a simple device. One places a Palm T/X in it and it charges. The device does what it is supposed to do. BUT I don't think every product that does what it is supposed to do is a J. D. Powers candidate for top product of the year.If you want to charge or transfer data through this means, buy it. There is no competing product that I know of."
5,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","Goodbye, Mr. ChipsI first saw this picture when it first came out. I loved it then and I love it now. I just wish it didn't take so long to get to a DVD format. The movie is just as fresh and enjoyable as it was in 1968. The music memorable. I would recommend it for all who has romance in their hearts."
3,Not so great....,"I am afraid I am another who must give this film a reluctant thumbs down. I am a great fan both of the book and the 1939 movie, and found this version unsatisfying, because by placing too great an emphasis upon the romance between Chips and Katherine the central theme of the original story was largely lost. And while I am a great fan of musicals, I found the musical interludes in this film irritations which disrupted the flow of the story. All of that being said, I thought Peter O'Toole was quite wonderful in the title role and Petulia Clarke likable enough. And the film is beautiful to look at- especially the loving treatment of the school itself."
1,Do not select the Greer Garson version you will get the 1969 version,"Unfortunately when you select the Greer Garson version you will get the 1969 version.Amazon offers you a Greer Garson choice to select but you do not get it.There is no way to get your $2.99 back from Amazon or to contact them to notify them of this problem.Too bad, I really wanted to see the Greer Garson version.George"
3,Mr. Chips Should Not Sing,"Peter O'Toole stars as the reserved, quiet private school master who learns to relax and open up thanks to the love of a good woman, eventually earning the respect of all around him. O'Toole gives an excellent performance, although having him sing wasn't the wisest choice. Petula Clark is warm and cheerful as his wife, and they work well together. Maybe if I was a fan of musicals, I might rate this one more highly, but they could have cut out every song and I wouldn't have cared. There's nothing memorable about the musical numbers. It's the story and O'Toole that carry the film. The music should have been left out."
1,A Great Disappointment,"After having watched the original Goodbye Mr Chips with Robert Donat, and having seen the two later versions of the film, both do no justice at all to the power and the emotion of the original."
5,This needs to be on DVD NOW,"This movie definitely needs to be on DVD. Considering what junk is being put out on DVD, it is a shame that one with the music and a story line like this hasn't been done. It doesn't cost that much to put it on DVD, so just do it and let all of us buy it and enjoy the movie and music!"
4,"Nice Musical, But It Could Lose 20 Minutes","This updated remake of GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS is an entertaining, if overlong (in its roadshow version), musical adaptation of the 1939 classic film, which starred Robert Donat and Greer Garson.Peter O'Toole is excellent in the leading role. He's no singer, but his songs don't really require a Howard Keel to put them across. Most of the singing, rightly so, falls to Petula Clark, who is quite charming.The songs are pleasant, though not really that memorable.Understandably, WHV has released the complete roadshow version of the film (rather than the shorter theatrical version) onto DVD. Frankly, I much prefer the theatrical version, because the roadshow version goes on about 20 minutes too long, making what could have been a very touching ending rather anti-climatic.Michael B. Druxman"
5,it was wonerful.,i got in the mail early. my favorite movie. got to it on tcm on tv. thank you very much
1,Goodbye Mr Cow Chips - Goodbye Movie Musicals-,"This is the sort of abysmal material that killed movie musicals. The music and lyrics are abominable and unsingable except the passable ""You and I."" Lyrics like 'London is London again' are at best redudantly repetive repetive and without meaning. The film plods along and Peter O' Toole can't sing. Didn't they learn anything from the equally abysmal Man of La Mancha because O'Toole couldn't sing in that one either?Petula Clark has some good moments but her falling in love with this dullard makes no sense. There is no chemistry between O'Toole and her.The length of the this movie is also long.The only saving grace are the great helicopter shots of Pompei and Italians Ruins. Cinematography is wonderful. The film, the plot, the music, the verasimilitude is nothing but Cow Chips. Goodbye Mr. Cow Chips."
1,NOT WORTH IT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!!,If you look on the web you can find this item NEW for $80.DON'T BOTHER!!!!
3,"""Typically terse, few entries include detail.""","Potential buyers should carefully read the Booklist review above. This book does contain a comprehensive listing of goddesses from around the world. However, the vast majority of entries simply list the goddess name, region and sphere of influence. If you want nothing more than a alphabetical listing by goddess name within geographical region this book is fine. If you want even a modest amount of history and/or background you will be sadly disappointed. A good dictionary should provide the etiology and meanings (ancient and modern) of a word. One would expect that a volume such as this one claims to be would provide at least a brief description of the history of each entry."
4,Wow!,"People are always putting on airs... and Theroux just proves it by taking a worldy traveler and showing that he's no better than the rest of us. Full of sex, stupidity and inner reflection."
2,"Tedious, disappointing","Theroux is good with words, and the first section, dealing with the semi-autobiographical narrator's youth, is a satisfying read. Then the protagonist grows up. He becomes a dull, selfish, philanderer, and the tone of the writing itself seems more plodding as well. Theroux's narrator is a womanizer, which is forgiveable, but unfortunately he's also a supercilious bore, which is not. The book carries no urgency, and there are better examples of the detached, clinical wife-cheater to be had. V.S. Naipul makes a promising psuedonymous cameo, but qucikly disappears back into the oatmeal-prose. Yawn. William Vollman covers the same ground with more skill, and dare I say it, heart."
4,Secret History,"Great book...truthful to a fault. Story flows nicely along author's ""fictional"" life. Insightful look at young man's life in turbulent east Africa, probably acquired through Theroux's stint in Peace Corps. Theroux is one of the best writers in America. Fun to read."
2,Not My Favorite,"I've said before on here that I am not a Paul Theroux fan even though I think he is a talented writer. Having read a few of his books I've learned he is not the author for me. While ""Hotel Honolulu"" was OK, this book did nothing for me."
5,Great introduction to the topic,"Everyone should own a copy of this book. It is the best sophisitcated introduction to classical mythology that is out there, and is filled with useful illustrations."
2,description,"Starting with clips from news broadcasts, this program, originally broadcast on December 10, 1993, probes accusations of bias and sensationalism in the coverage of crime and violence. Interviews with media experts and legislators highlight this ""Frid ay Night Special"" report, produced by ABC News."
2,A frustrating let-down,"I always hated Rykodisc's ""The Singles"" double CD because of the presence of severely edited tracks. Why would they go to all the trouble of gathering so much good music, but then chop the songs up? When I heard these new ""Best of..."" CDs were out and saw the track listings, I felt better about the whole mess, and I bought this one. Well, Virgin is apparently taking a cue from Rykodisc and including pared-down ""radio edits"" which omit essential elements of Bowie's great songs (such as the distorted guitar solo of Young Americans). I hate to break it to these out-of-touch fools, but this is NOT the version the radio stations play! When I saw that the disk contained extra CD-ROM material, I hoped that there would be some pictures/videos/interviews to calm my blood pressure, but it was only an advertisement for his website. Curse all of them. Don't get suckered into buying this."
4,4.5 ACTUALLY!,"I find it funny when people review a compilation cd and criticize it for either not having their favorite songs or for having edited versions of songs. These songs became hits because they were played on the radio. The versions that were played on the radio were edited! I am probably different than most in that I enjoy having an edited version on a compilation, since most of the songs I already have the album version on the album. What does bother me is when obvoius hits are left off in leu of other material or worse just left off leaving 15 or 20 minutes of space on a cd that could have been filled! Look at The Police, Synchronicity II, Secret Journey and So Lonely were all singles and left off of most compilations of theirs. My ownly complaint about this particular compilation is that of another reviewer in that it did not go up to 1980 and include songs from Scary Monsters."
2,Why the arbitrary cut-off date?,"It wouldn't have killed the record company to extend this into a six-year retrospective - 1974-1980, which would then have included songs from what is arguably Bowie's greatest album, 'Scary Monsters and Super Creeps'. What you're left with instead is a severely butchered selection - and a fairly predictable one at that. (There's considerable overlap with 'Changes2Bowie' and other compilations - but, hey, when you're just out to make money, stick to what works!) This artist deserves a more thoughtful, better presented retrospective of his most fertile and influential period, especially as he has now ceased to make worthwhile music."
3,thoughtless selection,"I wouldn't quibble if the original albums were still easily available. The ""Low"" album selections should include ""Subterraneans"". The ""Heroes"" album should be represented with ""Sons of the Silent Age"" and ""Joe the Lion"". The ""Lodger"" album should be represented with its first three songs, ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""African Night Flight"", and ""Move On"". Try hunting down the original albums or demanding their re-release.Recommended (for guitarists too): PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,Not the Best of david Bowie 1974-79,These songs are not his best during the period. There are a bunch of better tracks that are not on this CD.
1,What a waste,This is the first Bowie cd and I'm already disgusted. I bought this thinking I would get complete unedited songs but all this has is severely cut songs and a promo for his website. If you're going to make it pc compatible than at least give us a couple of videos at least. My advice: Skip Bowie altogether. He's a businessman not a musician dedicated to bringing the ultimate in quality to his fans.
1,Skip it....,"An 80s child, and the daughter of a massive Bowie fan, I'm a massive Bowie fan myself. I have played 'The Best of David Bowie: 1969 - 1974', 'The Singles Collection', 'Hours', 'Reality' and even 'Best of Bowie' (DVD) a thousand times each, and don't become bored of them. I listed to 'The Best of David Bowie: 1974 - 1979' once, and felt like throwing it straight out the window. I've not listened to it since.Don't buy it. I can see why it was only $10.David, darl, you have many late 70s songs far better than these ones. What were you thinking when you complied this one?"
2,THAT KID LYES,"Hi ppl. that kid lyes (i can't spell LOL) , the toy is'nt the MOST durable thing, but it's not that flimsy. Kinda boring, but not flimsy. The trampoline is really cool, though, it's like spandex type stuff, and I guess a good word to discribe it IS springy!Have a great day!!Darcy"
2,This Stunk!,"My friend got this toy for me saying it was the best, and because I'm a dancer. When I opened it, the doll's head fell off and when I dropped it, it broke. I suggest instead going to a real studio, because this was a waste of my friends money."
4,WTF?,"Why isn't this on DVD, already? With the massive success of Kathy Griffin's Emmy-Award winning My Life On The D-List(and her Bravo stand-up specials!), it should be a no-brainer. She's the only reason I watched the show in the first place. Come on Kathy--pull some strings. You're fans are waiting!!Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List - The Complete First SeasonFor Your Consideration"
1,I always called it Suddently Susan.....,It was the writing and the acting. I never thought it was that good.But that will likely not stop it from coming to DVD. Anyway to make a fast buck.
1,this is the wrong part picture,"The item pictured in the review is not the RH154. I don't know what part it is, but it is definitely not the RH154. The picture of RH157 is, in fact, a picture of the RH154, and according to Motorcraft the RH154 is compatible with 1999-2000 Contours, both gas and bi-fuel models, 2000-2003 Escort ZX2's, and the 2000 Escort ZX2 S/R edition. It also fits the 2000 Mercury Mystique. Hope this saves somebody some time."
2,The book does'nt teach you anything,"This book is'nt any good, alot of pages that wo'nt teach you anything about using the C language. after reading the whole book , my most complicated program was making a hangman. I don't think that this kind of book will be useful."
1,"Awful software, slow printing","Picked up one of these based on the feature set. Software and drivers are horrible - initial install bluescreened W2K. Reinstalled and was somehow able to get up and running. Printing anything other than draft mode was horribly slow - a normal color page took ~ 2.5 mins. During printing an annoying status window would come up to show print progress which was inevitably slow (for long periods it would just sit there, progress bar at zero). Occasionally the printer just hung, had to power cycle it before it would print again. PC would also sporadically bluescreen. Upgraded to W2K SP2 - no difference. Installed the latest print and scan drivers from Xerox and flashed the latest firmware onto the printer. Now consistent bluescreens trying to print from any application. Am returning the machine and have gone back to my trusty old HP printer which continues to work flawlessly."
2,Not All That Good,"I have had the opportunity of owning an XK50cx for the past two months and I was extremely disappointed. The print and scanning quality are excellent, it was easy to install, and very easy to make copies and send faxes.BUT... it is extremely noisy -- especially the sheet feeder. The drivers wouldn't allow me to share the printer from Windows 98 and print from Windows 2000 and vice versa. There is no power button on the unit, and it never went to sleep -- the scanner light was always on. Finally, technical support was very poor.We ended up taking the first unit back, hoping to correct the noise and not going to sleep problems, but the next unit was still plagued with these problems. We just replaced it with an HP G85, and it out does the XK50cx in overall quality."
1,Buyer Beware,"This multifunction device did not print or scan at all when used in conjunction with my IBM NetVista computer. The problem probably relates to the USB connection (my computer only has USB ports - no parallel port) and may have something to do with Windows ME, as well. So if you have an all-USB computer and are running Windows ME, you have been forewarned. I was extremely disappointed with Xerox customer service, also. They just blamed the whole problem on Microsoft and IBM and basically couldn't have cared less about my predicament."
3,Availability of this machine,"In my on going search for an ""All-In-One"" machine, I stumbled on this one. In reading the product features and customer reviews I thought I found the one. A few more clicks to the Xerox site stopped me in my tracks. I have found that this machine is no longer sold in the United States. The Xerox site did say that supplies are still available, but I have to question how long it will be before this machine is rendered obsolete due to unavailable supplies. Just a warning to other shoppers."
1,do not buy this piece of garbage,i had it about six months before i had to throw it away from shear frustration. built cheaply and support was non-existant. as much as i really hate to say it... buy an HP.
5,Voice of Apophis,"Hi, folks have complained about the voice of Apophis being inaudible on ""The Nox"" episode. I think this has to do with the surround sound setup on the disk. So, the voice is there, but if you don't have surround sound, you need to set your dvd player up properly so that it isn't doing surround sound output. Else Apophis is broadcast on channels you don't have, and you can't hear him."
1,Apophis - Speachless,"I have had the boxed set since it's release. The only problemwas this disk. The NOX episode is missing the voice for Apophis.He talks but nothing comes out.I rate this low only because of a real missed opportunity.Though this disk was available in the boxed set. It was onlyrecently released as an individual DVD. It has been a year atleast, you think they would have fixed it before this release.But, NO!."
4,No problems!,"I have this DVD and I have no problems with any of the voices. Like all the Stargate episodes, these are first rate. If you like SG-1 you will like this DVD."
1,Wouldn't even play,"I love the series and would love to see these episodes again. Unfortunately the DVD wouldn't even play. I tried it in three different players and it didn't work in any of them. The only signal I got was a ""no disc"" signal after the disc supposedly got done loading. I have the other four DVDs from Season 1 and have problems with Vol. 5, also."
1,Didn't last,"Less than a year after getting this player, the battery quit. Now it's worthless. The interface was difficult to navigate. Too much money for what you get."
3,"It's Alright, I guess","I got one of these as a Christmas present a few years ago. The capacity wasn't really sufficient for me, but it was free so I couldn't complain. It works just like a flash drive. I ended up changing out what songs I had on it every morning before heading out, and within a couple months, I could no longer connect it to my computer. I can still listen to the songs that are on it, and it will still charge when it's plugged into the USB port, but I can't change what files are on it. The computer doesn't recognize it. I tried it with a different computer and that one won't recognize it either. Also, the screen is so tiny, it become difficult to find a song you want to listen to. And the random function doesn't always work right. I didn't like it enough to begin with to bother contacting the manufacturer."
2,digital mp3 players,"I liked this product, it came right on time, I gave them away for christmasits size is amaizingthe bad part of it is that the FM radio part does not work on any of the 3 mp3 players."
5,So I'm a child of the 80's....,Love the DVD First Season of Chips. Brings back lots of memories. Recommend this product for people who appreciate the old 70's and 80's TV shows. Good clean viewing fun for the whole family.
5,The Rest of the seasons need to come soon!!!,I love season one but I miss the rest the seasons. Season two needs to come soon hopefully it will be released before the end of the summer or towards the end of the year. You cannot find this show on TV anymore. I also like the bonus features. Hopefully in future releases they will have Audio Commentary on Select episodes. Hey there needs to be a Feature Film in the works!!!!
5,CHIPS NEEDING TO BE RELEASE,"I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS SHOW PUT OUT ON DVD, I THINK IT IS A GREAT SHOW,AMAZON PLEASE HELP US FANS OUT AND SEE IF YOU CAN HAVE THEM RELEASE THIS TO THE PUBLIC"
5,AWESOME,Finally they released this classic show and it its awesome myself bieng a big 70's and 80's TV Show fan. Now let hope all the seasons get release and we don't have to wait a year for the next season
2,waste of time,"This is very misleading...thought it was a dvd, not a video. Video quality is not good, and does not do justice to the TV show this once was."
4,Pretty Good Picture But Could Be Better,All seasons of Chips have been shown in the UK in recent times on Digital Satellite channel Bravo (not the same as USA Bravo).The quality of the copy they showed was as good if not better than this DVD release.Of course the DVD release plays at the correct USA speed with no adverts or onscreen dogs.Some of the music from later seasons of Chips is out now on CD remixed from the original master tapes in stereo.This season is in Dolby Digital 1/0. Perhaps the later season will have more sound track options.
3,"So Bad, it's Good","As a teenager during the show's original run, I thought that ""CHiPs"" was not very intelligent, poorly written, and poorly performed. By the early 80's the show was so consistently bad, that for me it really became ""appointment television"". Remembering all of the laughs this show brought me during those years, I could not resist purchasing ""CHiPs"", the first season. After viewing a handful of episodes, I realized that my adolescent assessment of this series was less than accurate--""CHiPs"" is even worse than I remembered. To anyone who considers him/herself a student of television, ""CHiPs"" the first season is a ""must-have"" for your collection."
3,O.K.,"I have not even finished the first season yet, but it does not appear that it is going to be my 'speed'(pun intended). In each episode so far, there is a LOT of driving on the highway etc., and I suppose it depends on everybodies different tastes in movies. It is good in that kids might enjoy it and there is no swearing or any unsuitable behavior."
5,Great dvd set!,Great dvd set! My family is thrilled that Chips is finally coming out on dvd so that we can watch the shows again!
5,Outstanding Conversion to DVD,This collection was very well done! The original pilot episode includes the extended opening sequence/music. There are six DVDs in the collection with 3 or 4 episodes per single sided DVD. Each disc contains high quality artwork. Outstanding buy for a great program!Highly recommend this and hope they do as good a job on the following seasons and don't take a long time between seasons to release them for sale.
1,What a Drip!,"I purchased this iron last year and at first thought it was great. I had previously owned Rowentas but they leaked after a time and considering the cost, I didn't want to purchase another and run the risk of the spitting and leaking problems I had in the past with this company. The T-Fal started to leak from the water tank area and that dripped down into the inside and shorted out. I'm now going to purchase a Sunbeam ($24) and hope I have better luck."
2,"Not really a ""How To Book""","If you are looking for a book which will provide advice on how to write a horror novel, don't look here. The book is rather slim on writing tips and large on discussion the horror genre in general. If you are a novice to the horror genre, you might appreciate the lengthy background on horror fiction and the author's Freudian interpretations. If you've read more than a few, this background seems like too much filling.The book itself is also rather poor quality. Mine became unglued and fell apart from its binding- which made even re-selling this monster impossible.If this book were marketed as ""A history of Horror Writing"" it might be much more accurately titled. As it was, there were few tips and just a lot of expostulation- disappointing."
1,Got ripped on this one,"The product is fine, my complaint is with Amazon. It is a ""Prime"" product and is offered for $11.21, which I accepted and placed my order with no further research. My bad. I saw it at Wal-Mart today for $4.77, same product, same size.I order a lot from Amazon, but this is a good example of getting complacent."
4,Great Guide for Coins and Money,"I recently purchased some rare coins and went to a few bookstores in search of a price guide. I came across a few good books but they didn't have all the coins I had purchased, finally I found this one and it included all the coins I purchased. I looked online to see if it was cheaper and sure enough, it was, so I bought it! The book is fairly recent, 2009 publish date, so I think it should be fairly accurate with the price listing."
5,Christmas gift,"This was a gift for my husband, who has collected coins since childhood. He has spent considerable time since Christmas Day going through this book and chortling over the deals he has made in the past at a much greater profit (talking small change here!). One of the better presents he got this year:)"
4,Just what I needed,"Somehow one of the cotter pins fell out and my retaining bolt was bent. I searched all over for an economical solution, this is it! All OEM stuff so I replaced all of the corroded pins and greased them this time (which it looks like GM didn't do when building the car)."
5,Really nice gift,I shopped and shopped this mug because everyone else was so expensive. And I finally found this and bought it for my boss who is a Dallas fan all the way. He loved it! So good buy for the money.
5,Great,"I was good & cheaper than buying the individual DVDs, this is what u need if ur a REAL martial artist or just trying to learn BASIC martial arts moves/techniques...."
3,Why cut material for the DVD?,"I should preface this review by saying that Fight Quest was a great show. Much respect for Doug and Jimmy for their hard work and training! I think in a lot of respects it was better than its History Channel counterpart, Human Weapon. The hosts seemed to train harder, fight harder, and the show in general was focused more on fighting, as opposed to bits of history and computer animated techniques.The problem with this DVD is that *a lot* of material got cut from every episode. I have no idea why Discovery thought this was a good idea, it steals a lot from the show. The stick training scenes in the Wing Chun and Kalarippayattu episodes were completely removed. In some cases, you lose a feel for the intensity of the style. The Kajukenbo episode was particularly hard hit in this way. They seemed to cut most of the training sequences, which are the meat of the show.Bottom line, be aware that the quality of this DVD is not what you got watching the show on tv."
3,Good overview of multiple martial arts styles,"If you love to watch fights, this is not the show for you. If you want to learn specific techniques from multiple martial arts in detail, this is not the show for you. This show is just a good (but brief) overview of several different martial arts. Since each would take years to master individually, don't expect much in that regard, but if you're trying to decide which martial art to pursue, or if you're just curious about the differences between styles, this should be a good starting point. The hosts are likable and good sports. Instead of a bunch of macho arrogance, they always show respect and friendliness to their opponents, even when they just lost to them."
4,A Very Good Example of How a Tarzan Movie Should Be,"I have read quite a few of the Tarzan books, and the one thing that I have disliked about previous Tarzan films is the fact that Tarzan is portrayed as illiterate and unable to speak in complete sentences. In the books, he taught himself to read, and ended up speaking both English and French. I enjoyed this movie baised on that fact alone. It is refreshing to see a movie that closely follows the book it is based on, which is quite a rarity. If you are a fan of ERB's Tarzan books, and appreciate movies that stay close to the original plot, then you will enjoy this movie. Casper van Dien made a perfect Tarzan, and Jane March was a creditable Jane."
3,tarzan film appealing to fans of the genre,"good film for kids, nothing is overly graphic. some commentary has been made about van dien's stature by goobers like leonard martin, who ake it their job to get burned out on movies. didn't notice to tell you the truth; it's good but light family entertainment."
5,"Good movie, Great actor","I will admit that I saw this movie because I wanted to see the marvelous Casper Van Dien in a film partially clothed. Part of the beautiful scenery was the african locations and the other part of the beautiful scenery was the partially clothed Casper Van Dien. He is a man that has a beautiful body and is a celebration of the male body. Yes, this movie for me was a guilty pleasure. The movie travels a little too fast and it doesn't expalin too much about what is going on. In my opinion, it could have lasted longer with a little bit more suspense built in to the movie, but it is still a good movie. I do recommend this movie to anyone that likes Tarzan movies and especially to anyone that really likes seeing Casper Van Dien on film."
5,A MUST for all Burroughs fans!,"This is what Disney's version should have been. As well as those dreadful Weismuller movies. What a relief to see a movie Tarzan who actually speaks in complete sentences! And it was written and produced by people who actually READ the original novels. Casper Van Damme was the best Tarzan I've seen on screen, he actually made me believe him as a jungle man who had a taste of civilization. I always hated the old movies that made Tarzan look like an idiot who couldn't even talk. I also appreciated the absence of Boy and Cheetah. (no Terk either) The effects were stunning as well. Tarzan actually swang through the trees without all that silly vine nonsense. Good pulp entertainment done in the spirit of the original novels. Burroughs would have been proud."
2,ick,"This isn't even good for children. The whole thing is just horrible acting, scripting, et al.. Casper Van Dien, I'm sorry, is just a really bad actor. In Starship Troopers, he was decent, even good at times, but everything else that he's been in, is HORRIBLE. The Omega Code, Time something?, and now Tarzan. Avoid this movie."
2,fair film/ horrible actor,"I love Tarzan , so I had to get this. BUT, someone tell me, please, how does Casper, the worst actor alive, ever get into films? And why does he keep getting parts? Even in horrible films? My God, even people in Ed Wood films can act better then this ken doll. The film it's self is ok. nothing great."
5,Good middle of the road Tarzan flick.,"Van Dien makes a decent Tarzan. Jane March makes one of the better Janes which is fairly easy since the character of Jane is better written in this film than any other Tarzan movie I've ever seen including Bo Derek in Tarzan, the Ape Man."
1,Don't even think of watching this film. You'll be sorry!!!!,I paid $4.00 for this film and that was about $3.50 too much. Both the writer's and actor's of this film should be ashamed of themselves.
1,region codes,When I got the movie I found I could not play it because I live in Australia which is region 4. The DVD was Region 1
4,Tarzan Worth Watching,"I love Casper Van Dien, I liked him in the original Starship Troopers and if your interested in a Tarzan film that is entertaining and light, this is the film for you, your children will love it and Casper Van Dien is definetly easy on the eyes, I thoroughly enjoyed this film even though I am not a Tarzan fan."
3,An effective movie despite slow pace,It's not actually a bad Tarzan movie but it could have been alot better than it is. The special effects are good and the cinematography is real good. but as a hole i was unhappy mainly because of the slow pace. It could have had a faster pace. all in all an effective movie
1,Pure Schlock!,"Tarzan And The Lost City is a film that should never have been made, much less released. Sure the lead actor is handsome and built, and the leading lady is photogenic, but both never reached their potential in this parody--which I attribute to bad direction and uninspired script writers. He can't act, and she was totally vacuous. Only the villan was believable (aren't they all?) and while the shots of what 'may have been' the African scenery were OK, the rest of the film STANK. The action scenes looked contrived, the emotional content pure vanilla, and the wild animals were all too tame to be even the least bit threatening. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS!!! (My DVD will be going to the local library as a contribution--but will probably just gather dust on the shelves, it's THAT BAD.)"
1,Supplier out of this CD,"I ordered it but then heard from the supplier that they were didn't have the CD. Wish they had the one they has listed on the ""used list""."
4,Packed with Informatiaon,"I bought this book because I teach Spanish to preschoolers and I'm always looking for more resources. It is best for older children, 1st-5th grades. I got it because I was interested in the information myself and figure the teacher can never be too well informed! It is like an encyclopedia on México. A bit of information on a variety of topics. It leaves me wanting to find out more!"
5,Best book around for studying Mexico with elementary age students,"After looking at many books to get ideas and information for teaching a week-long study on Mexico to elementary age students, I found this to be the very best one around. It is practical and gives great, kid-focused information on Mexican history, language, families, food, music, crafts, religion and more. A real treasure! Cindy in Charlotte NC"
1,Stock footage of BKK and unconvincing non-Thai actors,"There are many misconceptions about Thailand and this ""B"" movie capitalizes on all of them. This very weak and plotless spy film centers on the chase of a Thai prostitute who unwillingly gets stuck with a biological weapon. The chase leads the viewers through strip clubs, kinky massage parlors and mud wrestling pits of what we are supposed to believe is Bangkok. However, the Asians in the film are not Thai. Some are Vietnamese and one is Caucasian made to look what Rollins must believe to be Thai. The action scenes are also absurdly unrealistic and the entire film is one pointless scene after another."
1,Big Disappointment,"My 8 yr old son is a big fan of the Magnetix Products. He saw the Magnetix MagnaWorld Series in a local Toys R Us and begged for it for Christmas. We purchased the Skyscraper Series and the City Series. It is such a huge disappointment!! It is extremely difficult to manipulate. It is only magnetized on the bottoms and tops of the walls- not on the sides- making it virtually impossible to build any of the models (unless you are an octopus). Even my very adept husband found it frustrating when trying to help. Magnetix, in general, are way too pricey but I definitely would NOT recommend the ""MagnaWorld"" line to anyone. It is going back to the store ASAP."
5,WHY????!!!!!,Why is this not out yet?!!!??!!! I LOVE this show and have not seen anything quite as funny before! Kirstie is great and I really hope she can get into comedy again because she rules at it! I have never laughed so hard at a single tv show before. I truly recommend this show anything who needs a good laugh and if you can even find it. Is there anyone that has at least TVrips on DVD or anything? My e-mail is f2theox@gmail.com. Please let me know!
2,"""Time for Go to Bed""","Wrongly attributed to Ed Wood's ""Bride of the Monster"" (1956), Tor Johnson utters the immortal line ""Time for go to bed"" in this routine horror programmer. Distributed by Republic Pictures, ""The Unearthly"" (1957) benefits from John Carradine's formidable presence and Tor's limited screen time. A drive-in favorite with superior print quality."
5,Classic John Carradine as Mad Scientist,"If you're looking for a truly twisted B movie, this one should not be missed. The special effects consist mainly of flickering light bulbs and mutations shuffling around in what appears to be a goth basement. Carradine (who in real life was a great, classically-trained actor) lays on the Shakespearean ham so thick, you'll find yourself muttering: ""Thou spleeny hedge-born hedge-pig!"" by the time the credits roll. Deranged, funny and unforgettable."
5,one of the best ABCD'eries out there,"Our daughter is obsessed with this book! The binding is kind of crappy and fell apart quickly, so we had it spiral bound. This was a worthwhile investment, as our kid can't get enough of this book."
4,This was a pretty good movie!,"What I liked about this film is that it's not just a coming of age story or even just a coming out story. It's about self-acceptance, something that we all struggle with no matter what age we are. Plus, I loved that all of the women in this story were strong and stood up for both themselves and those they loved. I don't see much of this at all in cinema--women who have self-respect and who are also respected by others for it. An all-around great story. Good for Patrick Wilde!!!!"
3,Fine movie but unrealistic,"The film was fine. Some of the fast dialog could be missed with the heavy accents. The performance with the actors; from the main 3 to the supporting roles, were done well. However, the story was un-realistic. Some of the fear was shown but not as deep as it is in reality. There is much more fear, uncertainty, less obviousness and a great deal more over-compensation that takes place today than what was shown. For the most part I enjoyed the movie but did feel cheated that what really happens to kids wasn't shown true to form. I just can't buy into the movie being 'great' because of the gay theme. None of the 'sex' was pushed in the audience face, no strong polical messages were used and there was no trying to change peoples minds. That does make the movie a good viewing experience."
3,"""Beautiful Thing"" was way better","This movie was average. Beautiful Thing was more magical and charming than this lackluster film. After the second viewing, I just found myself turning this film off. Not worth it people. The acting is okay for what it is, but the plot is dull and the film is very sluggish. If you like ""....-teen-coming-out-films"" then this is something you should glance at, but if you want a classic Teen Coming Out movie then you have to see ""Beautiful Thing"" because I love that film (THEY NEED TO RELEASE IT ON DVD). Also, I gave this film 3 stars because the DVD version ......, there were NO extra features, all it was was the film and nothing more. I felt robbed in a way. Also, the picture quality and sound were nothing spectacular."
2,nice try,"Almost hit the mark, deals with some serious issues, and funny in parts, but not extremly convincing. Still worth a spin, but needed some better casting."
5,Be happy,"Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone) is completely comfortable with the fact that he is homosexual, but such an monumentally heterosexual society, he only allows himself enigmatic, in nominate sexual encounters. John (Brad Gorton), is the beautiful high school jock, so daunted by his fear and isolation of being homosexual, is hidden deeply in the closet. By fate they meet in a men's bathroom, and despite Johnny's apprehension, become wonderful lovers. Their private moments together are so truly gentle, loving and sweet, perhaps so much more so than the couples in straight- themed movies. Although John and Steven veraciously love and care for each other, Johnny's paranoia of somebody uncovering his secret soon rips them apart. The solitary devastating part of this incredible film, I believe, is the heart- wrenchingly sad ending."
5,OUTSTANDING,"I had never even heard of this movie before today, when The Movie Channel showed it. This is the ULTIMATE movie for heterosexuals to see, especially parents of gays. I have immediately ordered it, I have never before been so moved by a film so quickly. I did flinch a little at the portrayal that we heterosexuals males are always ignorant and uncaring, but perhaps we are, at high school age at least. The film made me realize, that even I, a supposedly open minded person has probably been cruel and unfeeling towards gays. This movie is wonderful, BUY IT, and it's only $13.99. Please also consider ""Billy Elliot"", a fine movie that shows how I should have acted towards gays when I was younger."
5,The best coming out film ever...,"This is a film and a half. When I sat down to watch it, it was by advice of a friend of mine, and he was not mistaken. This film is a must to own simply for the fact that you will want to watch it over and over again (I know I did). The actors play their parts perfectly. As someone from the UK I can most definately identify with the issues that are covered in this film and over coming out. The supporting characters are hillariously funny, especially the best friend and the general feel of the film is one of realism.This one gets a definate Thumbs up :)"
5,The Best Gay Coming Of Age Film..EVER!!,"I saw this back in the late 90's for the first time and I just fell in love with this film.The acting, the cast and the atmosphere was great for a coming of age gay romance story.Personally being gay myself could identify with Steven (Ben Silverstone) and his issues that he goes through while trying to hold onto a little romance with the schools jock, John (Brad Gorton).Just bought the film on DVD recently, it was hell of a search because this title is out of print and I had to resort to buying second hand, but was not displeased with the price.I will recommend buying this soon on DVD before copies start to dissappear slowly out of circulation.***** out of 5 stars!!"
4,Coming of age and coming out.,"Teenager Steven is gay but doesn't want anyone to know besides his neighbor. This causes him a great deal of angst, and suspicions rise among the student body at his school in Britain. Steven and John, an athletic golden boy and the object of the girls' desire, carry on a secret affair. Of course, nothing stays secret forever, and John turns out to the be far weaker than the courageous Steven, who even pens an article called ""Get Real"" about his situation and gets it published in the school magazine.To get real is to get honest and to stop pretending and faking, no matter what the consequences might be. That's the message here, sent loudly and clearly."
5,One of my very favorite movies,"I love this movie. It's one of those magical little Brit flicks in which everything just works. It's also one of the very few films that I can watch again and again (with intervals of a few months in between) and still feel the same kind of emotional response.No doubt much of my reaction is personal, and I suspect this movie is pretty much a gay thing. It may even be more specialized than that -- a gay thing for people who aren't American idiots, which would rule out much of the audience for teen-oriented entertainment, as evidenced by a couple of the more vapid reviews in this thread. So be warned if you are (a) straight, (b) stupid, (c) unable to tolerate non-Hollywood fare, or some ungodly combination of the above."
3,"Good Story, Lame Ending/Message","I stayed with this story (which changed my sister's life, but that's another story completely -- she fell in with a group of very nice Get Real online fanatics!) right up until the last few minutes, when it did a couple of 360's and ended up in the ditch. I'd watch it, but save my money to buy Beautiful Thing or Trick."
4,As real as it gets,"Get real is a movie which makes me have mixed feelings. Sometimes you will pity for Steven and sometimes you might just want to say to him , ""Find another guy, he's not worth it!"" Steven fall in love with an athletic guy who wants the gay sex and love with him but don't want anyone else to know. If Steven gets near him in public he will simply freak out. So what does poor Steven have to do? Well, you have got to watch it then.... Its a great movie about coming out but personally I don't think the characters are developed that well. Anyway I give it 75 out of a hundred."
5,EXPLOSIVE!,"This movie rocks. It is the only movie about young gay men dealing with life that i can think of except for BEAUTIFUL THING, which btw is also excellant. I laughed, i cried, i got tensed, and you can actually feel their emotions at certain points in the movie. If you ever wondered what goes through a young gay man's head as they realize their sexuality definately buy or rent ""Get Real"" or ""Beautful Thing"""
5,"A Love Story . Defintely something more, but no less","This film is a love story. It doesn't matter if its main characters are gay, straight, or something in the matter - it's still a love story. And a very good one at that :) There is such a shortage of truly well done love stories today - this one redeems the genre. It was so refreshing to see a teen romance handled so wittily and so lovingly. The feelings this film evoked in me are similar to the ones I felt while watching another great romance - ""Shakespeare in Love."" Recommended to anyone who wants to watch a good love story."
3,get real,"This was a really good movie! It has a lively story line that that never leaves you board, but what was really great was the cemistry between the people. The characters were very well writen and you really feel for them. This is not just a some good gay movie; it is a wonderful story about love and acceptance."
5,How Real is Get Real...,Get Real portrays the true emotions felt during anyone's adolescence. This movie will move you and motivate the heart to care and love a little more.
3,A good coming out story,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit because it nicely depicted the complications that arise from being in the closet, ultimately coming out, and having to deal with the sad consequences of someone else's failure to be honest and truthful. Of course it's tough to be ""real"" when that is exactly what friends, family, and society often don't want to see, but in the long run it is just so much better than trying to live a lie and make yourself believe this is okay. In the film, I thought the writer did a nice job of showing how some people who appear to have everything actually end up with very little of true value while the ""outcasts"" often shine with true grit and integrity. Overall, this is a feel-good movie with a mostly good ending. The characters are great. You'll like it!"
5,I don't know what to say,"I was not going in bathrooms looking for dudes when I was younger. But I certainly was in the same predictment. I'm a 20 year old gay male, and I still have problems talking to my parents about it. I will say this movie is an accurate depiction of my own life. I was not exactly a geek, but I was not very popular in high school. People knew about my sexuality and pushed me around. I found my first love in one of the most hottest, handsome guy in school. And he told me that he too was gay and it went on from there.I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was beautiful and so was the storyline. It is just what I love in a movie. I also recommend Beautiful Thing for others.. those brits really produce great coming out movies..."
5,Fancy a fine film...,"This film is great! Charlotte Brittain (Linda) is a breath of fresh air. Ben Silverstone (Steven) is very authentic and charming in his own way. At first I thought that this movie was going to be hokey because of the title. Just like a book, never judge something by its cover. ""Get Real"" wasnt implying the cliche expression, it was redefining it. Not only is this film entertaining but it could also be a powerful tool to help encourage people who are dealing with similar issues."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I thought this movie was horrible. It was very boring. I think the only reason people are rating it as high as they are is because the film deals with homosexuality.
5,"Haven't got it yet, but...","I'm going to go out and buy this CD today. Why am I writing a review about a disk I haven't heard yet? Because last night I had the pleasure of seeing Hancock, Brecker, Hargrove and Co. perform this show live and I was completely blown away. I've attended a lot of live jazz performances over the years, but this one certainly rates as one of the top shows I've ever seen. Breckers ""Naima"" was breathtaking. Buy this CD, and if you have the opportunity to see this band live, don't miss it."
4,"Excellent Greyhawk adventure, first of two","The village of Kusnir has been beset by a Skulk... a dark presence that curses the very land itself and claims the souls of any who dare go beyond their thresholds and into the night. What does it desire? The answer lies beyond a wonderful series of adventures in the ruins and monster lairs of the peaks of Alderweg... once your PCs (levels 2-5) have made their way past the Xvarts, Owlbears, and Gargoyles, they'll find the object of their quest, a mystical gauntlet known only as the Sentinel, and a rathering startling revelation as well! This is one of the best UK adventures, featuring many monsters from the classic Fiend Folio."
4,A two-part Classic that ought to be brought back,"This module (with its sequel The Gauntlet) was one of the very first that I really fell in love with. I remember hours and hours of exploration and adventure. What a loss that such an old (venerable????) tale has been lost to the publishers and the gaming community at large. Many of the newcomers to the game would find this old adventure a new favorite, I am quite sure. How I would love to have my old copy back!!!! If you can locate one for yourself, enjoy it, and pass along the word--bring back a classic!!"
2,Really annoying presenters!,"The two people who present this book on the audiotape version are really annoying. I did listen to the whole tape, but fought the urge to turn it off the entire time because I couldn't stand listening to the voices. The information presented was marginal. The discussions of music and opera would have been a lot more effective if snippets of the actual music we're included. Doesn't seem like it would be that hard since this is an audiotape. I used this tape to study for the MSAT (a standardized test for elementary school teachers in Calif.) and didn't find it very helpful."
2,Smug tone outweighs usefulness,"The flippant style mentioned by the previous reviewer is what hurts this book. It could have been a great reference, but the authors try to get cute in almost every single entry. Don't bother."
3,Missed the boat,First reading found three errors.Second found another.Not too swift if I can stop them.
5,This is a must-have,My one and only complaint is that the book is a tad heavy if one is reading it while nursing a baby (multi-tasking Mommy style).
2,Nothing quite as frustrating as an extended intellectual misfire,"I appreciate brevity. Seems to me most commentary and analysis goes on too long. That was my attraction to this title, but that's not the problem here. Every topic is handled concisely though often not very effectively. The problem here is a twisted central view that produces sheer nuttiness like this books anachronistic take on Freud. I wish I had more time to elaborate, but, suffice it to say, you WILL be disappointed. This book is about a dozen re-writes from something worthwhile, and I wish I'd looked the reference section over a little more rigorously before wasting my money on this tome."
1,"Completely Oversold, Irritating, Disappointing","Written in an irritatingly flippant style, this book falls far short of its promise. It is poorly organized and indexed which ultimately results in frustrating those wishing to quickly glean succinct information. Instead, it is filled with ""cleverly"" written tidbits that more often than not miss the entire point of the subject matter. Don't waste your time."
4,Clear speech,"The book is thin enough to carry around in your pocket or briefcase.There are chapters dealing with relaxation, breathing and posture as well as common problems such as hoarseness and plumminess. Pretty standard fare.There is a section on building resonance. There are 4 series of exercises for developing ""forward placing of the voice"". There are chapters which treat the difficulties of forming the English S, R and the clear and dark L sounds as well as the glottal stop. If worked diligently the exercises will work wonders for your clarity and carrying power.Finally there some exercises to develop the lips, the tongue and the teeth which are challenging, fun and effective."
2,Shows why my friends don't like opera,"Poor Verdi- this is arguably his most exciting work, but you would never know it from this video, which should have been left in the vaults. The sound quality, staging, lighting, costumes, and sets are all awful. The orchestra is slow and wooden, stodgifying a remarkable score that should be full of inspiring tempo changes and dynamic shifts and instead leaving the principals stranded on stage, waiting for the instruments to make the key transitions. The staging is forced and awkward and the acting not believable. The chorus extras wander about in the dark, horribly dressed and without purpose. The Anvil Chorus is joyless and dark- I didn't even see any anvils! The singing is quite good, esp. by Sutherland (despite her lack of acting), but is hard to enjoy given the other detractions. Probably the best value here is for hardcore Sutherland fans."
2,Grim and boring,"I had to force myself to get through this thing, and it took several days to do it. Not even Sutherland could save this turkey. If you like this opera (and I don't), then I highly recommend this production. Everyone in it was outstanding. I had this on CD with Callas many years ago and wound up chucking it. I hated it. The tenors and Sutherland each and together have a few good moments, but not enough to make a 2 hour and 20 minute opera out of. The mezzo gypsy did her part well (the relief came during the final curtain call when she smiled and then she looked human and beautiful), but I greatly dislike Verdi's mezzo gypsies, and his operas are littered with them. Blood, guts, burnings at the stake, death, torment, Verdi at his finest. All the gypsy woman did was suffer. I read that Sutherland was 60 when she filmed this, and she could still do it. Only she does it better when she's got something to do it with."
4,Nice Remembrance For The Concert Seen In Los Angeles....,"I purchased this CD the day before leaving for Los Angeles to see Barbra in concert for the 2nd of her final four performances, and I decided not to listen to it. I'm glad I didn't as the concert I saw was much different from the recorded version in many aspects and I was able to hear the show first hand. However, the album itself is a great remembrance for me... just listening to it for the first time allowed me to transport myself back to the show and remember the amazing sights and sounds of experiencing Barbra Live first hand. A nice addition for anyone's collection, especially those of us lucky enough to see her in concert!!! (4 stars purely because it's a concert CD....)"
5,Spend a New Year's Eve live with Barbra Streisand!,"Though this concert took place in the Eve of the new millennium (2000), i bought it a bit before 2008 entered and had my New Year's eve be accompanied by this CD. Barbra is so lively when she puts on a show, so interactive, that her ""presence"" and voice can fill your house as if you are there seeing her on stage.In this double CD of the concert some of the best songs from Broadway, Movies and Duets are recorded, and through them she gives the audience a journey through her own career. She sings her wonderful song People, before the New Year enters, from the movie, Funny Girl:""People who need peopleAre the luckiest people in the worldWere children needing other childrenAnd yet letting our grown-up prideHide all the need insideActing more like children than children..."""
5,Amazing!,I was so excited driving to the music store to get this album and my excitement was not wasted. This album is Barbra at her best! You may have heard the songs before but this is a truly remarkable album! It will bring back memories for those of you lucky people who were there and it will make memories for those who weren't.
5,THERE IS NO ONE BETTER!,"If there is anyone who doubts that Barbra Streisand is the greatest female entertainer of our time, then they should listen to this recording. I was a young teen when I had the pleasure of seeing her live in New York's Central Park in 1967. It was amazing. And now, 33 years later, I'm lucky enough to be going again next week- to Madison Square Garden. This is probably her best live recording. Her voice is as great as it ever was. A sure winner!"
4,The Greatest Star,"I can't wait for this concert to appear on DVD. The energy and excitement simply beam of the disc. From the opening Nola Recording Studio to the final with Lauren Frost, I was captivated. Granted, Barbra does not have the voice of 25 years ago, but dammit, she's relaxed, personally happy, and performing live."
5,Keep Listening,"This was her return to the concert stage to ring in the year 2000. The songs are her old tried and truebut to this day, they still sound wonderful.If you don't have it in your collection, it's worth the purchase.Robin Iveson"
2,Time Has Moved On,"I found this very disappointing. I am quite a big fan of her torch songs from the 60s, but she can't sing them now. She relies on the slow low notes and boring songs without any emotion. Her voice has dropped significantly and she talks, talks, talks to cover it up. She can't reach or maintain the high notes and there's no way she could sing a song like 'Free Again' anymore. And the problem is the long high notes, power and emotion were her trade mark. Oddly, her personality has evaporated too - again her ego and wit were a trademark.Quite simply she has left it too long to resume her live performances - she was either too arrogant or scared in the 70s and 80s. Anyone who finds the recordings of the 60s and 70s sends tingles down the spine should avoid. For new fans - stick to the earlier recordings."
2,The Way She Was...,"I saw this show both in las vegas when the album was recorded and in los angeles at the staples center. I am not too thrilled about the song selection, but I guess she had to include the New Year's stuff and Simple Pleasures since she had to differentiate from the great Concert last time around. The Staples Program was a lot stronger and her power was just amazing. The biggest disappoinment for me was that she couldn't see fit to sing Stoney End. If she could do Main Event, she could have gone done the Stoney End one more time, if for no other reason to get a performance of it on video or DVD."
3,not what I hoped for,"I have been a fan of Ms. Streisand for years but I was disappointed by this collection. The patter was annoying at times especially the ""cute"" comments to her husband and friends. The song selection was good, not great. I thought the ""Piece of Sky"" segment highlighted the decline in both her range and breath which was obvious on other songs as well. Buy this if Barbra is your diva of choice but you can find almost every song sung better on her studio albums."
3,A Whole Lotta Schtick and Some Songs Too.....,"Don't get me wrong -- this is an enjoyable enough listen for Streisand fans. But there's so much schtick going on LIVE (meaning visually), much of which seems lost and/or meandering on a 2 CD package. And unfortunately a lot of the schtick writing is not very funny to boot (an awful Shirley MacLaine Y1K thing which is flat as a pancake).But when Streisand turns the focus to herself, and her own life -- from the early nightclub days through the ease and happiness of her ""new"" life with Brolin, the CD gains enormous force. The ratio of songs to patter/schtick is nothing like the last concert release double CD. But Strei-SAND will be remembered as one of the reckoning forces of the 20th and 21st centuries -- she-who-wills-it-to-be-so, and that brand of perfectionism is always a fascinating thing to watch."
1,Another tired and uninspired collection of very old songs,"Do you we really need yet another collection of tired, old songs from Barbra? This CD is just like one of her concert CDs revisited and regurgitated into a messy uninspired collection. Save your money."
5,"Sturdy, tall, and well made","I love these jack stands. I am using them to hold up a Nissan Maxima, so they are way way way more than capable of doing that. The reason why I went with these over smaller capacity jack stands was two-fold. Number 1, I also have a Suburban which I will use these on. Number 2, I thought the extra height would be nice.A note about point #2 - the extra height is nice. BUT keep in mind that you have to get the car that high or higher to get them on the jack stands. That was the tricky part. But once I figured that out, all was good.These jack stands appear to be well made. I like the double locking feature as it gives me a little more peace of mind. I am actually in need of another set of jack stands and will probably pick up another set of these because I like them so much.Get them - you won't be disappointed."
5,Perfect,"Great units. Nice and strong. I have a Ram 1500 pick up and a Suburban 1500. The jack stands fit under nicely with no increase to the height or sometimes 1-2 notches up. So they seem just the right size for these vehicles. My neighbor has 2 cheaper units from h.frght (which I love to shop at) that he puts under a Ram 2500 diesel.... no way for me!!!! I bought two at first and then a few weeks later ordered another 2 (from teh same supplier). So now I have 4 of the same strong units (with the double locking pin) for a few bucks more. Can rotate tyres and perform other maintenance much easier having the whole vehile up on 4 stands.Overall very happy with both my purchases, no problems with and part of the transaction. Thank you!"
5,Great jack stands... but know what height you need,"These jack stands do what they are supposed to do. My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine. My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height. These jack stands are tall. I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under. I will be lifting it soon though, so that will change, and hence the reason I got these. For a normal car though, these would probably not be my first choice.Also, if you are using them on asphalt, be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little. On concrete you wouldn't have this problem, but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.Finally, be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use."
4,Good Product for SUV,"I bought these stands after reading here all the feedback about it!I have to say they are good tool for SUV, because they are kind of tall without lifting them not even one pin up. so if you are looking for a car, they might not be good for you, also make sure you have a jack that can lift it up enough to fit the stands under your SUVIn General, they look very strong and good product and safe to use"
5,great product,"These jack stands are really good! I would highly recommend these. Even if only 3-ton stands will do, get these; very tall reach, large base, very stable. Well worth it."
2,Not For Cars,"I gave these a low rating because they are not well described. They are quality stands but they are NOT for cars. You'd think they would've written the height in the description or say that it is for trucks/SUVs only. They are extremely tall (even at the lowest setting), and I couldn't get them under my car."
3,"Often Slow, Often Wordy, Always Wolfe","Silk, a young priest enlightened by a god, sets out in the company of thieves and prostitutes to save his temple from destruction.Like the first book in the series, Lake of the Long Sun covers a period of about two days, giving it a plodding pace in which events and conversations are padded with an abundance of detail. Wolfe's style is not so puzzling here as in some of his other books, but still manages to be less than clear at times; happy news for some, sad for others. I read Wolfe when I want to pay close attention and still not know what just happened. Overall, the story is a political one, dealing with spies, intrigue, and the vile motives of shady leaders. Not my cup of tea, and thankfully kept mostly in the background. What fascinated me were the slowly unraveling secrets of the Whorl, all of its embedded mysteries, and the process of discovery."
2,Meh....,"I ordered this so I'd have a chance to wash my little guy's blankie. It's a poor substitute for the super soft and cuddly Little Giraffe blankie that magically puts him right to sleep. This security blanket is thin and not real cuddle-inducing. Kinda disappointing, but then it was less than half the price of the Little Giraffe blankie. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,cuddly,8 misunderstood exactly what this was. I thought it was going to much bigger. It is a little over priced for what is but it is still cuddly and cute.
4,MEMORABLE COMEDY,"I'm still chuckling at a couple of the scenes.......the movie is somewhat dated but still as funny as ever, with Henry, Michael and Shelley playing the main roles. The plot has been covered but I will address one of the themes, that I always enjoy folks trying to do something to make money with idle time, even at the morgue. Besides making a few bucks and staying awake on the graveyard shift, the boredom was certainly taken away with the phone calls and out-service dates. A good movie for a lazy evening - bring on the popcorn and be prepared to have a belly laugh. I believe that the second showing ten years later was still hilarious."
4,Old Fave!,It was an old favorite. My husband quotes several lines OFTEN!It is a nice addition to our dvd collection.
4,Good Oldie,Any fan of Michael Keaton should not pass this one up. This was his ticket to being a true star. He mesmerizes with his charm and fast wit and steals the movie. An oldie but still a goodie.
3,Birthday Gift,"Sent this book to a friend for her birthday and have not heard , if it has been helpful or not.She was impressed that it was a signed copy.She had recently bought a 3 yr. Fino stallion and had been having some issues with him.I thought that having this book , as a reference would help her develope this horse and work on his issues!"
3,Odd collection...,"This one had the feel of a middle finger being raised in the direction of A&M Records, who had recently dropped him. Hiatt and his new label cobbled this collection together from live recordings and newly recorded versions, along with a recent track (""Cry Love"") and some licensed older material. A&M would return the favor a year later with the vastly superior ""Greatest Hits"". While the title may be misleading, there certainly is good music here. ""Riding With the King"" was until recently an overlooked classic, and ""How We Make a Broken Heart"" (with Roseanne Cash) is quite nice. The set also features two new songs, ""Don't Know Much About Love"", and ""Love in Flames"". If you're a Hiatt fan looking to expand your collection, this may interest you. Those seeking an introduction or essential best-of are referred to the aforementioned ""Greatest Hits""."
4,John Hiatt,"Super adult, contemp. music.Heard a song during the movie, ""RAISING HELEN""...researched it, foundit (THIS JOHN HIATT ALBUM)...didn't stop playing it for 3 days!!!!Loved every track on it. What a gem.Would highly recommend it, just for pure vocals and soothingdynamic. LOVED IT!"
3,Huge Hiatt fan knows he can do better!,"I am a huge Hiatt fan, having all of his CD's except one.. I was not thrilled with his new version of Have a Little Faith on this CD.. The original on BRING THE FAMILY is the ultimate.. It is very hard for me to say which album of his is my favorite b/c I love them all.. but BRING THE FAMILY is awesome with Ry Cooder's beautiful slide guitar wailing in the background! I love the mandolins in all of his newer stuff too.. catch him live in concert, and you'll be hooked for life! Slow Turning, Stolen Moments, Perfectly Good Guitar, Walk On, Little Head, and Little Village is another cool project that's worthwhile! And I truly love his very first album ever, HANGIN AROUND THE OBSERVATORY made in 1974.. his voice sounds different, but the more I listen to it, the more I love it!"
4,A Partial of John Hiatt's Greatest,This is definitely not a definitive collection of John Hiatt's Greatest works. There needs to be at some point a Greatest Hits Vol II or III or even better a boxed set in order to truly include everything this outstanding singer/songwriter has contributed to music.
4,Missing a few good ones,"I LOVE John Hiatt. He is so under-rated and over-looked. He is so talented. Great writer and great musician. Bring the Family, Perfectly Good Guitar, Slow Turning...all ROCK! Check out any of his albums...all are great!"
4,"Good, but not quite what I expected.","Ever since ""Have a little faith in me"" I have been a huge Hiatt fan. But, this wasn't a compilation CD of all his best songs as they were released. It was more a CD of him re-doing all his best songs and ""Have a little faith"" was changed a bit. But I did like the other songs he included. It's a good CD, but it wasn't the GREAT I was expecting."
4,Best of John Hiatt,"Whereas the Slow Turning CD is a better CD, this one ain't no slouch. A very good CD for the John Hiatt enthusiast."
3,"Good stuff, but ....","I don't know why Hiatt had to re-record his best tune for this, ""Have a Little Faith in Me."" The new one has icky disco drums and an unneeded female chorus. Why, John, why? He also re-did ""Drive South,"" but that one's not as bad. The rest is all good. This and ""Bring the Family"" are all the casual fan needs."
5,Still 5 stars despite not including .........,"Excellent compilation, great sound, great artist! I agree with all that has been written already but am I the only fan who can't understand why 'She Loves The Jerk' has not been included? It was the 1st song I looked for when I bought the cd. Yes, it is always hard to do a Best Of. So much good stuff. But this song is a classic Hiatt cut. I love it. But ........ the material is so strong that to give it less than 5 stars would be an injustice. When will the world take note of John Hiatt?"
3,Glasses were fine,Just could not get used to them. Maybe I need to be older. Or wiser. I dunno. Is this enuf words yet?
2,I don't agree with A. Seddon's review.,"I don't agree with the review that has been posted on this site. In a paranoid and weird way, it seems to accuse the author of being a member of the far right. I think that is cruel and unjustified. However, it is fair to say that Simon Goldhill - as the academic consensus internationally indicates - is simply (a) a profoundly unpleasant man, and (b) a pretty useless scholar.So, criticise him within this framework - as a failed academic and a failed human being. But don't make accusations about his political outlook which cannot be derived from his scholarship. Unless Mr Seddon knows something we don't?"
4,Engaging glimpse into the world of street fair art shows,"Choices is an engaging story that keeps the reader in suspense from its hook at the beginning to the end. Ashworth gives us an intimate and fascinating glimpse into the world of street fair art shows with intrigues, jealousies and romances. The characters, while numerous, are artfully drawn. Their eccentricities adds interest and a sometimes comic touch to a well-conceived plot."
5,Another great Trojan box set,"THis is maybe the 8th Trojan box set I've bought, and it's another quality collection. If you buy several of these there will be a small amount of overlap, but it's maybe 3-4 songs that appear elsewhere on other collections.I'm not familiar with a lot of the non-reggae ""hit"" versions of these songs, but it's fun to hear some of the other ones that many people will recognize like Monkey Man or Red Red Wine. I'd say that the liner notes also get some points for subtlely (and not so subtlely) dissing UB40 in discussing their repeated success doing covers of other peoples' songs. But whatever, that's neither here not there.This is another great collection of older 60s/70s reggae & rock steady. If that scratches your itch like it does mine, then this is a no brainer. From Trojan I'd also suggest any of the dub collections, Roots Reggae, Rare Groove, 12"", Nyabinghi and The Aggrovators. Just great, great stuff all around."
1,Cooling Feature Does Not Work,"The PEK Wine Steward Supremo cooling feature does not work at all. The bottle was always warmer than the household temperature. In addition the unit does not truly ""seal"" the bottle in between uses. ""Customer service"" never answered the phone over several days and depsite being told to leave a message for a prompt call return no one ever called back. AWFUL!"
2,Hack Wilson deserved a better writer than Clifton Blue Parker,"Clifton Blue Parker had a great subject in Hack Wilson but Parker fouled out with his writing.Parker took a interesting ballplayer and turned him into a bore. His chapter ""Hacking Toward Immortality"" was written like it was taken out of a daily newspaper. To many mundane accounts of each and every RBI. It would have been nice to also have a little more info on his second wife in the years after Hack died.It took me weeks to finish this book. I couldn't believe I spent so much money on this bio. I will not buy anything else from Clifton Blue Parker. I think he is a overrated writer."
4,P.J. Bombeck,"""All comedies end in marraige, or is it the other way around?"" Witness the domestication of the original Republican Party Reptile as he holds forth on life with his children with the same self-centered satisfaction he's skewered in his contemporaries for years. While it's not his best, P.J. on a bad day still gets more stars than Dick Morris on his best. Probably prettier women, too. Otherwise, it's a pretty honest compilation piece which ends, ominously enough, with a revisit of India and Pakistan in August, 2001."
3,A bit disappointing ...,"Maybe marriage has worn off his edge, maybe the last days of Billy Clinton really isn't joke material for him. I mean, Bill got in trouble for getting oral treatment, ... something that would proved perfectly agreeable with PJ. Anyhow, it's simply not as biting as his previously books. Too much excursion into his imaginery caricatures, and not enough bite."
3,Not one of his better efforts....,"After all the brilliant books to come from the pen (word processor?) of O'Rourke, this comes as a bit of a disappointment. It is a disjointed effort - while it contains a lot of O'Rourke's usual wit, there isn't the cohesive theme you find in many of his other books. He rambles around, recording conversations with his assistant or teenage nephew for much of the book. There is his biting lampooning of the bad and not-so-great, and many salient points are made; but very often the humour feels contrived. Perhaps this is a book that needed just a little more spit and polish."
3,It should have worked,"But it didn't. The conceit just did not cohere. The passion, the clarity, the wit were all on the back burner. Even the great P. J., everyone's favorite right-wing fascist (i.e. non-Democrat), has his off days and this was one of them.All is not lost, however. I recently finished a long piece of his about Egypt which was in top form so I am confident in his next book he will be back in his game. But until then . . . oh, well."
3,"A contractual obligation, PJ?","Even though I don't agree with his politics, I've always enjoyed PJ O'Rourke's writing. He's funnier than most other writers, and can turn a memorable phrase better than anyone else. So I looked forward to this book with great anticipation ... and I was disappointed. It looks like PJ didn't write this because he was inspired by any topic, other than getting a paycheck. So he took a bunch of things he wrote for magazines, and then linked them together with a sort of narrative. There are flashes of PJ's brilliance here and there, but it's a very uneven book all in all. If you like PJ, wait until this is out in paperback or you can find it remaindered."
2,"Disappointing, dreary, dull","PJ O' Rourke is a funny man at times but this book didn't do it for me. There's a heavy US flavour to the book which is not a criticism but makes it less penetrable for an outsider than the only other O'Rourke book which I've read which was ""Holidays in Hell"" and which I enjoyed immensely.I also found it interesting that some of the other readers who were most highly critical of this book are non-Americans like myself.Frankly I agree with those who find his tirades (and I think that's the most appropriate description) boring. No matter how clever the language in which they are couched his rantings become a little tedious. I'm about half way through the book and I don't think I'll finish it."
3,Stick to the plot PJ,"I am a big PJ O'Rourke fan, but he is at his best when writing about the idiocies of political systems and economies around the world. He is not at his best making us chuckle over his domestic arrangements. Still, this has plenty of good stuff. I found his comparisoms of Venice and the Venetian Hotel funny and surprisingly informative. Not his best, but add to the collection."
4,send PJ to S. Africa,"I've been reading PJ for 15 years, but this not my favourite PJ book (although, a great title).I thought it only got really good at the end when describing India. This is what PJ is best at ... the stuff he used to do when roaming the world, with Rolling Stone picking up the tab.I hope PJ is at the Earth Summit going on right now in S. Africa ... lots of material going on there for PJ to take on..."
4,If only politicians had the same viewpoint!,"The world would be a much better place if politicians understood what P.J. (and his readers) know! P.J. again gives a ""no holds barred"" assessment of how politics works in a ""laugh to keep from crying"" manner. His description of the U.N. was hilarious, yet bitter truth. He also gives his view on all aspects of life using a clever array of characters to spout off to. This volume fits in well with ""Eat the Rich"", ""All the Trouble in the World"", and ""Give War a Chance"". So, pour another Gin and Tonic, light that cigar, relax and have some fun!"
3,Not Up to Par,"P.J. O'Rourke is a marvelous writer. He is intelligent, witty with the ability to capture nuances in conversations, places and events. Unfortunately, CEO on the Sofa is not some of his best work. The most redeeming thing about the book is the dialog between the essays which is jaunty and amusing. Mr. O'Rourke obviously had fun. But the dialog provides only the most tenuous of links for the essays, many of which are far below Mr. O'Rourke's best work.My experience with Mr. O'Rourke is that his ""planned"" books are much better than his ""unplanned"" books. That is ""Eat the Rich,"" ""All the Trouble in the World"" and ""Parliament of Whores"" are far superior to ""CEO on the Sofa"" and ""Give War a Chance"" (although ""Give War a Chance"" IS replete with some very funny essays).My recommendation: take the book out of the library but don't buy it unless it's a gift to a O'Rourke fan--it isn't a complete loss, and I'm all in favor of supporting good writers."
2,What a letdown,"...after being blown away by the previous cd, ""The Golden Age""! Im an unabashed fan of most anything that David Lowery puts his hands to, there's just something missing here.The album is LONG. Worse yet, it feels long. Almost an hour, and it lacks sustainable charm. Standouts include: ""My Life Is Totally Boring Without You"" and ""Waiting For You Girl"", both possessing sly wit and laconic delivery that is signature for Lowery. There's a few other things to tap your foot to, but this is the wrong entry point to Cracker, I really don't think this shows off their smart, infectious rock talent at all. Is it in the shadow of ""The Golden Age""? Maybe."
4,Good Album by a Great Band,"Not Cracker's best but still well worth the money and time to listen. The same blend of country, rock, punk, and ""alternative"" that we come to expect from them.Some real gems: ""My Life is Totally Boring..."", ""Hold of Myself"", and ""I Want Out of the Circus"" are great fun. ""Trials & Tribulations"" and ""Wedding Day"" illustrate just how unclassifiable Cracker are. ""The Good Life"" is an energetic start. And ""Unnamed track 24"" deserves a name: a wonderful showcase of their new bassist's talent--she out Bonnie-Raitts Bonnie Raitt!""Hallelujah"" is actually quite beautiful, in contrast to many of Cracker's ""slow"" songs which tend to be.... well, slow.... (This general trend is also excepted, in spades, by ""I Want Everything <Kerosene Hat>"" which is easily one of their best songs on any album.)A good album by a great band, but (as with much of their stuff) a bit too much left off the cutting floor..."
2,I Can't Relate,"Sorry Mr. Lowery. You've lost me. I can't relate to songs about the life of a rock musician on the road.If that's where you are right now and that's where your writing is, well, that's fine, but there's nothing I can pick up on and call my own.And any piece of writing needs to be identified with in some personal way by the audience. The audience makes a work their own. How in the hell can I make ""Dr. Bernice"" my own? I don't know, but I do. And I can't do it with a single song on this album."
4,A good effort.,"This latest effort from Cracker is excellent. It's a long CD, but there's no filler and the songs range from rock to country to blues and even a touch of circus-type organ on the appropriatly-named ""I Want Out of the Circus"". Even though this CD runs the gamut of styles, it still comes out very evenly in that there a no truly bad songs on here. They're also one of the few bands that can slow it down without becoming boring. All the Cracker CD's are good, but this one is special."
4,GREAT CD!!!,"I don't know why we never saw a video from this cd played on MTV or heard it on the radio, in my area anyways. Its a dynamite cd!! Great ROCK n Roll!! Lots better than their previous cd."
5,this is a great record from start to finish,its been along time since i've found a record to play over and over and over. but here it is. this is the best cracker lp yet. this album grows on you and gets better with every listen. check it out!!!
3,Even though I don't listen to this music i liked it!,"I am the kind of person that listens to r&b and soft music and rap, and I actually enjoyed it and I would reccomend people who like this kind of music should buy it!"
5,Money saved,Our vet recommended these for our dog who has some hip dysplasia as a preventative. I was thrilled to find them $30 cheaper here than at the vet!
5,Wow!,My 13 year old Pomeranian was stiff after laying around and would no longer move much. He could no longer jump up on the bed or the furniture. I tried this Glyco-Flex II chew and within a week he was moving more and within 2 weeks he was jumping up on the bed and furniture.......it was like a miracle. So much that my partner and I are almost considering taking it ourselves........since we are beginning to have the same problem! :)
2,SLOW!! SLOWER!! SLOWEST!!,"I hate giving one of my all time favorite singers only two stars but I have to be honest. I have been a HUGE fan of Billy's for years! I even met him, saw him in concert everything. But this new cd is too slow!! Its boring and I probably would have given it only one star if I wasn't such a die hard fan. If your thinking about buying a cd of his buy ""It's What I Do"", it's his BEST cd yet!! I also highly recommend his greatest hits. Hes a great performer, talented artist, great looking guy, but this cd is just not my style. Sorry Billy."
1,tacky,"I love to wear false eyelases, but these are hideous! I thought I had hit the jackpot when I saw these on here for the price. well, unfortunatly if these sold for a nickle they would still be over priced. Cheap, cheap, cheap! If you are going for made-up fake look or useing them for haloween, then these might be for you. If you are wanting to look pretty and natural, don't buy these!"
1,bad looking,"When I bought these fake lashes, I was expecting at least a minimum level of quality... I am use to wear false lasches but those are ridiculous and a very bad copy, which I won't ever be able to use! I have been buying a few false lashes on Amazon and I have to say those are fake and does not look as good as in the picture. Very disappointed."
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book! It even has a section on hood replacement! Great photographs! Wish I had it when I started my rebuild. Combined with the Haynes book, they cover everything you want to know.If this book had a complete wiring diagram, it would be perfect!jct"
1,Hodge Podge Of Noise,"Really with an lp featuring Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer you would expect a top notch effort but this album fails to impress.It's almost as if you want to like the songs but they fade into a scramble of noise and poor songwriting.Even Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo sounds terrible.Honestly nothing here to recommend."
3,JOHNNY WINTER AND,"After not hearing this album since my days in high school i was looking forward to checking it out once again. Much to my surprise i was shocked at the crummy sound quality on this disc. The drums and bass are mixed down too low and there seems to be a continual hiss or ""scratchy"" sound thru out the cd. At first i had thought it was put out by some other independent label other than Columbia but upon inspection the disc does say ""Columbia"" on it so...why the crummy sound? It also stated that the cd was an ""import"" so maybe that had something to do with it. This cd does have its moments however with such great songs as ""Prodigal Son"",""On the Limb"" and of course ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo"" plus the twin guitars of both Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer. I can only hope that Columbia will put this back out one day with the proper re-mastered sound it deserves.But for now,be forewarned about the lousy sound on this one."
3,Guess I'll Go Away,"Just spent an afternoon surfing Winter Websites, & I'm surprised that no-one mentions 'Guess I'll Go Away'; the opening track that for me led to an interest in Johnny for years to come. I Mean 'R&R Hootchie Koo' & all are fine, but as a 13 year old guitar freak, hearing that for the 1st time really opened my mind. (I don't just mean the 'flanging', I'm still not sure of the time signature in this) A shame he didn't do much more in this vein. This album & 'Still Alive & Well', still do it for me, and are among my all time faves, but non of them are free of 'filler'.."
3,Cute Illustrations!,"This book is not the best book for storytime or a bedtime story. It is very short and has little action. However, it is great for teaching beginning math vocabulary dealing with size."
3,forget being able to write on blank labels,"I haven't yet been able to find something that will write on the blank labels and not smear--not permanent, waterproof pen, not Sharpie. Look nice but I'll have to get other labels!"
4,spice bottles,"The bottles are great, the labels are not. They don't stick very well and peel up on the ends. I suggest purchasing other labels for these bottles."
4,Great Anime on a budget,"If you're looking for a good series that won't break your wallet then look no further than Hyper Police. I'm not a fan of special features on DVDs so I'm very happy that to save money, none were included.The first four episodes I saw at a convention about a year and a half ago and I thought the show was pretty funny. It took me a while to find the DVDs but I'm glad I have. If you're an anime fan that likes a somewhat serious story with lots of humor, this is a good choice. Don't expect anything mind bending though."
3,golf glove,"This product performed as advertised, but as with most ""golf fixes"" you have to mentally overcome the problem too. Would not recommend this product for most cases."
5,Superb,"Hawkins is one of the greatest musicians America has produced. This is a worthy collection for someone who is new to his work. It has two versions of his breathtaking Body and Soul. It is splendid to see Hawkins, and other fantastic players, on the DVD, but BMG should be ashamed at the way this product is packaged. it's disgusting that they couldn't be bothered to identify the personnel on the DVD, and this Centennial series is a bit of a laugh: it offers a single CD where a dozen are deserved. If Jazz records sold well I'm sure they would give us more elaborate products. Think of this as simply a pretentiously packed ""best of"" disk."
4,Rah Rah,"My 8 year old niece thought this was the coolest addition to her ""big girl"" cheerleading outfit."
5,anatomy of an infrastructure,"This book ranks as one of Macaulay's best, as it reveals the networks of systems that are the lifeblood of a city, from various building foundations to sewers to subways, showing how they are constructed and sometimes interact with each other. The text, though minimal, is packed with information, which is supplemented by the superb and detailed drawings. One of the coolest aspects of the book, though, is the views from below, as if a rat with x-ray vision were able to gaze up at this intricate maze of technological wonders. Macaulay's sense of humor is evident throughout, as seen by his inclusion of various critters (including an alligator and an elephant), lots of references to dogs and fire hydrants, a billboard ad for his book PYRAMID, and even a human skull and hand (!!) in one drawing of an excavation. Great fun to read and highly recommended."
4,Good clear book for the layman / secondary school child,"An award winning book, famous amongst teachers of architecture. This book is full of pen and ink cutaway line drawings of just about every underground structure, explaining to the lay person how they all interact. The problem is it is set in the USA, but that aside, it is a very interesting book.J"
5,A new perspective on things,"Macaulay uses his amazing talents to turn the world upside down in this unique book. Children (and even adults) will learn all kinds of things about what's beneath a modern city. I enjoyed showing my son the illustrations and explaining what it all means. Do beware, however, that this is a pretty abstract topic and that it can be difficult for younger kids to fully comprehend exactly what's going on. After all, thinking about what a city would like like with all the soil and rock removed and from many feet below street level is not a simple idea. So this one is probably best for older kids, as opposed to earlier works by Macaulay such as Cathedral or Castle that are much more tangible and easy for kids to comprehend."
4,best read on a colored device,I used this first on a kindle touch.not good as too small and bulk an white device.best to view on a pc or laptop or kindle fire
3,Disappointed,"I have several other books that show cut-aways of various subterranian and this one just doesn't do the genre justice. Perhaps it's because of the lack of description of what you're seeing or the logic behind the organization of the subterranian systems. As a book of drawings, it's fine, perhaps I just expected more."
1,Rather Disappointing,Rather disappointed - expected something more child friendly - more like the how it works series - would've sent it back but the postage is more than the cost of the book. Information about the target range of customer would have been helpful as I was not able to review the book before purchase. I had simply purchased on the back of his other titles.
4,One of my favorite CDs of 2000,"I've always been a fan on electronic music, I grew up listening to New Order, Front 242, PSB, etc but for a long time I couldn't find any ""new"" groups that grabbed my attention. Some where to ""synth-poppy"" for my taste and others were to harsh or industrial. If you find yourself in a similar position as I did, you HAVE to get this CD. The first time I heard about Neuroactive was through a review on ""Interface"" magazine. I bought the CD just based on the rave reviews where the album was described as the perfect hybrid of EBM and synth. FOR is more than a solid album... it's also the CD that renew my faith in the current synth/EBM scene. Highly recommended."
3,More like 3.5 stars,"""Fiber-Optic Rhythm"" is a pleasant sounding CD, more synthpop than EBM with a little techo thrown in for good measure.There are some great tracks on the CD, my favorite being ""Visualize"". Guest vocalist Geoff Pickney (of ""The Nine"") is the slam dunk to an utterly fantastic track.""Fiber Drum"" is a pounding instrumental. ""Moments Passing By"" is really good as is ""Parallel"".The rest of the tracks are pretty fillerish, well maybe with the exception of the title track. There's promise here definitely."
4,a cute kids movie,this was one of my favorite movies as a kid and im glad i got it. the characters are funny and kids will also like the songs.
3,"Its no Secret of NIMH, but....","While its not one of Don Bluth's best in the vein of his earlier films NIMH, An American Tale, Land Before Time or even All Dogs Go to Heaven, Rockadoodle is no less enjoyable and certainly more fun than the somewhat heavier drama of those films. Dont believe Amazon's review. I was 11 years old when Rockadoodle was released and while the plot certainly isnt airtight, I never had a problem following the story. If nothing else, Rockadoodle succeeds in what should be animations highest goal... fostering the use of one's imagination. This movie has been unavailable for far too long and I look forward to introducing it to my daughter."
5,My Fav Movie as A Kid,"When I was about 3 or 4 years old, I remember going to the video rental store with my mom and getting this movie. I loved this movie and it was one of my favorite things to do as a kid. I reccomend it to anyone with a small kid."
4,A kid's favorite.,"I watched this movie as a small kid, and I loved it. To an adult, this film makes no sense, and sure is pointless. But, when I was little, it was full of danger, fun, music and bravery. I used to beg my mom to let me watch it again. I loved it. A kids movie."
5,Rock-A-Doodle ROCKS!,"Rock-A-Doodle is amazing! Sure, the plot of the story may be a bit over the top and stereotypical, but, HELLO! It is a cartoon, what more do you expect?! This is a great cartoon to just let your brain rest and enjoy."
1,A confusing movie,I rented this movie awhile back for the kids I babysit for. The plot just doesn't make sense. It's just a series of events that happen. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it.
5,huh?,"This is shannon doney... I dont know what that charles solomon guy is talking about. this was clearly a great movie, he must not have been very bright not to understand it. but then again some people wouldnt know a good movie if it bit them in the butt. ive loved this movie since it came out and now that im 22 with 2 kids i still love it and ill bet they love (and understand) it too. :P"
5,What a day!,"I bought this for my nephew and he absolutely loves it! This movie came out when I was just a kid but it is as great now as it was then. Great quality video, great songs, and fun for the whole family."
3,OLdie but Goodie,"Loved this movie as a kid. Not as great as I remembered.It was short, not a full song the entire movie, plot felt rushedOlder animation shows a little dull. Still a good movie that makespeople happy."
2,Your Left Feeling WHAT?????,"While i dont hate this movie, still it's no Princess Mononoke, Toy Story, or Fantasia, but the film just left me wandering, what the F*** was i watching, largley because the story is about, and i quote here, A ELVIS INPERCANATING CHICKIN THAT IS YOUR HERO, or at least that's how they make it out to be in the first couple of minutes soon later there's this new kid nobody even cares for, the music scene's dont really add any charm to it all, it has the trailer which surprised me, but aside from that, i'd say this one is only for real serious movie and dvd collectors, case closed"
3,More for Eckists,"This book has age old wisdom but it is more for Eckists themselves, as this is a collection of articles the Master of this path wrote from 1996-2005. The stories that illustrate his points are universal but it is mainly aimed at Eckankar members, as the articles were written for them. So keep this in mind. If you are not a member, you can STILL apply the principles, but there are other books more geared to newcomers that would probably be better, such as his Call of Soul."
2,I love this show,I love this show However I finally got around to starting to watch the disks and I have tried them in 2 different type of players and they are freezing and skipping. I have tried cleaning them even though they didn't look dirty and nothing is helping.
4,CLM1963,"I enjoyed watching Quincy, M.E. after so many years. My only disappointment was that one of the DVD disks was faulty, resulting in one of the episodes to be unviewable."
5,The Great Quincy M.E. Finally Out on DVD... Wow!!!!!!,"For a man in his early 40's, I can remember countless nights evenings and even Mornings (Re-runs) watching this entertaining Tv Program, remembering how the Title character (Quincy) might have solved a fascinating case. I can't wait."
5,"Your right, Klugman is a GREAT actor...","But don't miss him, he's still alive. I saw Jack Klugman and Tony Randal in ""The Sunshine Boys"". Live in NYC. I was in the 4th row and let me tell you, with out a doubt, it was one of the greatest nights of my life. They had such great timing... 2 unbelievable actors that capotilized on each others acting style. They don't make them like that anymore."
5,Quincy,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I believe Season 1 was the best season for Quincy but I like both seasons. It was just what I expected.Mary
4,Quincy autopsy,"Quincy was the start of it all - the original CSI technology and crime solving. We were anxious to share it with our oldest (17 yr) and managed to bridge the generation gap.Great show with out the horrific details of the newer CSI types of shpws. Thaknfully, Quincy lacks the edginess of the newer shows and It is something this family can watch together"
3,Quincy,"We enjoyed watching the seasons 1 & 2, the pictures were very clear;however, when we got to the last DVD that had the most shows on it we were disappointed that our DVD player did not want to play it. It seems as though there were marks on the DVD and cleaning it didin't seem to help. The DVD stayed in the case in a drawer until we were ready to view it so we find it highly unlikely it was anything we did to the DVD ourselves. Very frustrating and disappointing."
4,Quincy a go go,"Quincy is better than I remembered. It is interesting to see how medical shows have developed since then. Klugman does a good job, if a little slow by today's standards."
5,quincy1&2--,The first csi...Nice to get these on dvds and be reaquainted with the original csi. It is quincy to the rescue when some thing just doesn't add up. Just think of what Quincy could do if he had all the updates in medical science! The shows are about an hour and fifteen minutes long. They are still great to watch.
3,pixelated??????????,"My husband is enjoying the dvds, but was disappointed to find some of the shows pixelated. We expected better quality."
5,"The only thing I can say about season 1&2, as well as 3, is to ask why season 4 is not yet available?","I want season 4 and more! You have to go to the U.K. to see this series on TV running these days. It is more than nostalgia, the series had good acting and interesting situations in forensics and more."
4,"GREAT SERIES, GREAT PRICE BUT.............!","If you're a fan of 70's TV shows, Quincy is a real gem! This first DVD release includes seasons 1 & 2. The four episodes that make up season one and the first three episodes of season two are from The NBC Mystery Movie series which is where Quincy began. These episodes are movie length (TV movie Length that is!...around 73 minutes) and are really some of the best shows of their kind.At well under $20 for the two seasons I decided to take another look at this series which I had not seen in years and I was not disappointed. The shows hold up well and the combination of mystery, crime drama and Klugman's sarcastic wit make this a very entertaining show. I would have rated this release 5 stars, but there are absolutely no extras. On the plus side the episodes look very clean and the audio and video are as good as can be expected."
5,simple but true,They said that it would be here at a certain date and it was here earlier than they said. The video was in great shape.
1,amazingly bad,"There are two types of show this program produced. The stiff were there is who done it, and the soap box. The soap box shows are almost unwatchable. The basic formala is some one some times lots of some ones die, this is because of some problem that good old Dr. Q. becomes an expert on IN 30 MINS AFTER MEETING WITH ONE PERSON. This would be like declaring youself a PHd after reading one book on a subject. You can also could on the good Doctor to say He is outraged about somthing about 30 min mark. While I too am outraged, that any govermental body would have this half baked clown on its staff."
2,A Burned Cd Too,As the other reviewer i also got a burned cd the picture on the cd itself is a sticker you can tell the cd is not an original. Not only is the cd burned i saw the track listing and the outro didn't come on my cd. Also the casing is bootleg with the liner notes looking like it's printed on a home computer printer. And need i remind you i bought this from amazon not an independent seller on amazon marketplace. I gave it 2 stars because of the fact that it is a bootleg cd. I can't believe amazon would actually sell a bootleg cd. The music is great other than that though.
3,Author may have fallen to his own premises.,"The author outlines some interesting ideas, but may very well have fallen victim to his own concepts. While one can discount planning and faith, contingency theory leadership has its limits, but so does the belief that all is random, thus what can one really do in life. I got a distinct impression of negative qualities from the author, which overshadowed the entire book. Wish he had stuck to the idea of randomness in life."
1,Fooled by the Author,"This book has little substance on the central theme of people having a poor understanding of the cause and effect of events, and that people with poor math literacy are often misled by numbers.A far better book on this topic is ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences by John Allen Paulos.More than the lack of substance the tone of this book makes one think that the author doesn't respect the intelligence of others. Yet he doesn't any new value to this subject as you'll see if you read other authors on this topic. Perhaps the author was fooled by the fact that someone would publish his book, but that doesn't make him a mavin on this topic, especially since his examples are retreads."
3,Decent Enough,"After reading this book I can say that both sets of arguments (the very highly rated and the one stars) are correct. Taleb makes a valid point about randomness in markets and correctly asserts (I think) that what amounts to day trading is just a sexier version of gambling. However, the book is written in a smug tone that saturates the text. The entire book can be summed up by saying,""I believe everything is random and if you disagree you're a moron and I won't listen anyway because I know I'm right, neener neener neener"".If you're reading this on a plane or just need a book to kill time and flip through a few funny stories while you get some topical insight on randomness, this book is decent enough. Serious students should read a statistics book or something by a vetted professional. Three stars."
4,Read the Book & Beware of Black Swans,"I recommend this book highly because it points out how `professional' investors are less than professional in believing that they are significantly smarter than average. It might seem obvious that not every stock or bond trader can be above average in intelligence (compared to every other trader), but the author's thesis is deeper than this. He explains one important and costly problem as the black swan mistake, and I don't want to spoil the effect by explaining the concept for potential readers. But if you want an interesting short article on the subject by the author, see [...]"
4,"Good book; ""Black Swan"" is better","This book has a lot of very strong opinions and some excellent insights. The discussions of the role of probability and economics are very interesting. The comparisons of trading styles are also very useful. However, his own very strong opinions makes one wonder what black swans he might be missing."
2,Tries to be like John A. Paulos but not as good,"Wow, it's not that good a book. Kind of like what you and I, with a science background and with the help of Google, could write. Mostly personal aggrandizement. Tries to be like John Allen Paulos but without his IQ. Two stars."
3,interesting but not much substance,"I was really excited to read this book as I heard many good things. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand Taleb's ideas/concepts. I thought he spent the first half of the book explaining what he was going to explain. Frustrating. Then we go down this path of we know nothing and are surprised by random events - unless you were one of the terrorists on 9/11 then it wasn't a random event. Not sure we needed hundreds of pages to explain that. Again, maybe I just ain't too smart."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Overall, I found this book enjoyable. However, the salient points could have been written in a few pages. The book drags on and seems intent on settling scores with either colleagues or the demons in the author's head. The author makes a dull subject interesting - but his writing style and hang-ups are a turn-off after a while. A shame really, as the the book is an interesting read when the author stays on-theme."
2,"Interesting topic, but poor execution.","Taleb claims in the introduction that he wrote the book without doing any library research. Believe the man.The overall subject of the book is interesting, and the author makes some good points here and there. However, he doesn't support his points with many references or specific examples. The book is disorganized and rambling, and Taleb often raises subjects without really explaining them thoroughly. If I didn't already know about the demise of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), then Taleb's comments on this topic would have left me scratching my head.Taleb also irritates with his constant name-dropping and providing irrelevant, personal details about the people he describes.Avoid this book, unless Taleb gets a good editor and comes out with a heavily revised edition."
2,"Interesting concepts and ideas, not a great read","This book had plenty of interesting facts, points and concepts posited, but the reading of the book itself is less than great. I would've enjoyed the book much more with a better writing style that scripted the text rather than regurgitated the factoids. The interesting tidbits the author has studied aren't compelling enough on their own without a solid background to wrap it all together and move the reader along."
5,Great,"Although a slightly pessimistic view on life, Nassim gives a great outlook and perspective of success and the role randomness plays in it."
3,It kept me guessing,"Its one of those books where I searched for a central idea till the end. I get it that we can be fooled by randomness but whats new to that ???However, I liked the book in certain chapters, they ascertained the thoughts a deep thinking analytical mind may go through..Once again good book but lacks a end that ties it together."
1,Save Your Money,"The title of this book is a bit misleading. A better title might have been: ""Fooled by Randomness: How Foolish Other People are and How Much More Worldly and Clever I am Than They (With Emphasis on My Fondness for Parenthetical Exposition)""Reading various recommendations of the book elsewhere, I had the sense that this was a popular book about randomness. Having read half of this book thus far, it appears to be nothing more than a narcissistic, meandering stroll through anecdotes relating to randomness, with heavy emphasis on how *totally kewl* the author is compared to various bond traders, mathematicians and dentists.There is certainly insightful information to be gleaned from this text, but...WOW, is it painful to do so.If you are a fan of Mr. Taleb, this might be the book for you. If you are looking for an accessible book about randomness and statistics, it might be better to utilize the ""other people bought..."" links."
2,"A book with an attitude! Unfortunately, not a good one.","First, an admission, I could only make it about half-way through this book. What I did read was neither particularly original nor particularly well written. The real turn-off for me was the tone of the book which was like a second year college student who's learned a new fact and then damns the foolish masses for not being as intelligence as he. There's been other books published that deal with this subject and which do a better job of presenting the facts without the 'Mr. Know-It-All' attitude."
2,Cranky Egotistical Exercise in Nothing,"I had high hopes when I picked up the book. There's a great story here -- how people are foolish in their behaviors and expectations with respect to events that transpire around them. However, the book reads more like an exposition of how wonderful the author is in recognizing this effect, and how ridiculous everyone else is for not recognizing this themselves. I'll agree with him that there's huge randomness in who is ""lucky enough"" to be in the right place, at the right time, practicing the right strategy for that time, in order to get rich. However, there's nothing rigorous in here that tells me that the author's strategy is better -- how do I know he's also not employing a strategy that ultimately is not worth more than anyone else's strategy? He's definitely smarter than the average guy, but lots of smart people have employed poor strategic choices. I'm on the lookout for a better description of this arena."
3,Not as good as the Black Swan,"I read the Black Swan and I loved it. So, of course, I had to read this book too. It turned out to be a rehash of the same material, but not told with the same conviction. In the Black Swan he pulls no punches. Here he has not quite gotten all his material together and you can feel it. If I had not read the Black Swan I would have liked this book. But, since he wrote a better one, I would recommend the Black Swan and not this one."
4,A Must Read,My husband has been struggling in the market for a good 5 or 6 years. Its really opened his eyes though. Of course its all common senses but when you've lived in denial for so long its a real eye opener. He was able to put himself into many of the positions and has stopped living on the if's and could've or should've been position. There's no more hoping for him he's looking for the signs now.
3,An up and down effort,Should be half its length. In the end I learned more about Taleb than about anything else.
5,A reality check for all investors,"This book is a must read for all investors however sophisticated they think they might be. In Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb sheds light on an aspect of investing that very few players are ready to acknowledge for fear it would deal a massive blow to their egos: Lady Fortuna, the role that pure luck plays in any investment performance. It is an essential reality check for those who are so obsessed with return that they forget about its inescapable companion, risk. Taleb is a master at illustrating complex mathematical concepts with very simple images that anybody can understand. Take the powerful image of the Russian Roulette: You don't need a PhD to immediately grasp the concept of alternative histories and realise that you have to judge a performance by the cost of the alternative rather than just the most favorable outcome. In addition to being very informative, this book makes for very entertaining reading. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
4,Very readable,"Taleb warns you at the outset that the book is like a conversation or essay, instead of a self-help or a treatise book. With that in mind, I found it extremely readable - finished it at one go - and I'll never look at every day statistics the same way again."
5,Great Book,"Most of the ideas presented in the book are deadright. Being a lover of Mathematics and I think its almost a necessary condition to understand the points of the book, I have realised many of these points personally. What surprises me is that many well educated guys from science/ engineering simply do not understand simple things of maths in real life. I have friends who swear by Buffet and believe, inspite of getting it wrong on so many occations, that there is a thing called ""Absolute Winning Strategy"". By first principles, I am reminded of my Finance Professor at a Business Program "" Future is Uncertain"" So how can there be an ""Absolute Winning Strategy for future""?"
4,I like this book,"I like this book because it's intellectually stimulating. It doesn't matter that I don't agree with some parts, while others I agree with strongly. What matters is that it makes you think of things you haven't thought about before. And that's the most important part.I agree with the main theme of the book, that people underestimate the role of chance and overestimate their skills. It's cool, and often funny, to see the book discuss many of examples of this.I disagree that financial markets are a random walk. I think there's a lot of randomness there, but since people are involved I think there's got to be a lot of non random characteristics.If markets were purely random, in the mathematical sense, I don't think people like Taleb, even mathematicians, could make money trading."
2,interesting concept but falls short,provides some interesting arguments however this book seems like nothing more than the ramblings of an egomaniac. all this book did was inspire me to buy puts to cover my longs incase of the black swan event other than that it just leaves you confused.
2,Great thoughts--could have been written in 10 percent of the pages,"Taleb has some good thoughts, and is occasionally witty and amusing. However he drones on and one about the same thing. Could be truncated, and then offer (more) thoughts on execution."
1,Fooled by Taleb,"Slipshod thinking and appalling writing from a preening egoamaniac with a fat wallet. Of course, the great irony is that, for all Taleb's admonitions to beware survivor bias, this would never have been published if he himself had been unsuccessful in his trading.The author confesses in the first few pages that he did no research specifically for the book, and relied entirely on memory -- and it shows whenever he writes about anything not autobiographical. Even then! Maybe this is a fictional memoir of a repulsive, unreliable narrator, a Nabokovian game? Taleb does claim to be a ""connoisseur"" of literature. The joke's on us, I think."
2,"Good topic, please, use plain English","One of the hardest books i ever read, not finished yet. IMO, practicing in randomness doesn't prevent the author from using plain English. This is a good topic"
3,disappointed,"After the title and reading a little bit, I was expecting greatness. I never finished it."
4,"if you like to read Blink! and Freakonomics, you would like this one.","This books illustrates how we humans are wired to underestimate the impact of rare events.Our (social? genetic?) conditioning towards inductive reasoning may leads us exposed to grave dangers due to decisions based purely on evidence garnered by inductive reasoning.Highly recommend this one, if you like books on prospect theory, Blink! and Freakonomics."
3,Reading time is precious,"I read this book several months ago. Half is a haphazard memoir and half is a preface to statistical and behavioral science.I read Malcolm Gladwell's article, ""Blowing Up: Wall Street's heretic counts on disaster"" this morning. (The New Yorker, April 22/29 double issue, 2002, pp. 162-167.) This article features the book's author (Taleb) as well as related facts and issues.The NYer article is more informative, better written, and takes much less time to read."
5,A fascinating read,A fascinating read including topics such as probability and psychology of investing. I especially enjoyed his critique of the tendency to establish an association between reward and skill. I'm embarrassed to admit that I found his derision toward these performers hilarious.
1,No need for another book like this,"The book could have been better written if there had been a topic. The title is attractive enough for me to open the cover, but the contents are loosely connected with repetition. Lack of detailed rigorous proof is also the weakness although the author claims to be otherwise. If you are sitting on the beach in Bali, you might want to pick this up. For me, I rather spend my time with something more worthwhile."
2,A random collection of ramblings (buy Black Swan instead?),"I managed to read the entire book (which means its an easy read and decent enough. I will not go so far as to say its worthless, as I say its a 'decent' book). So, here's my bottom line. Each chapter has the same unfounded examples-- Taleb casually mentions someone did something and concludes 'see, its random'. He does this over and over again. Fortunately, he concludes the book by acknowledging he's as dumb as the rest of us. His thesis does seem to have 1 definitive source of proof: by random chance many, many people (including me) have been fooled into buying this random book. Maybe his 2nd book, Black Swan, is an improved version-- I would suggest (randomly, since I haven't read it) to just start with Black Swan."
5,Interesting Content in an Easy-To-Read style,"The topics are very engaging, and the author's style is very verbal (write's the way people talk). Highly recommended."
2,Does not deliver,The book sounds like it will give you some insight into the markets or the ramdomness of it. It builds on that expectation but does not deliver it slowly turns into a boring mumbuling of anecdotes. I did not finish the book and left it half way.
2,Noise-to-signal ratio too high,"The endless ego-centric platitudes in this book raise its overall noise-to-signal ratio to the point where the reader wastes too much time in getting its basic message: that life and the financial markets are ruled by randomness and that our brains are not equipped to properly assess probabilistic situations and avoid making wrong decisions. The book provides precious little practical advice on how to cope with financial randomness, other perhaps than reading The Economist instead of the daily financial press: essentially Odysseus' way of waxing his ears in order not to to fall prey to the sirens' songsI would recommend Peter Bernstein's ""Against the Gods"" instead as a means to learn considerably more about the role of chance in the markets."
2,Fooled by Taleb,This is a very eclectic book. It is not very well-written. It is filled with self-congratulatory asides and anecdotes. It rambles and seems to never get around to its major point -- that luck is more important than skill in creating opportunities.I finished the book. It took a long time. I am not sure it was worth it.
3,"Interesting topic, but a little confusing to make a point","I expected an ""Wow i'm surprised"" kind of book, I got an ""Ok..got the point..after all that blah blah"" .Don't get me wrong, some parts are fun to read but many times beats around the bushes with little hard probabilistic facts.Also seems Mr. Taleb despises speculative actions.. I agree in the trading world that's gambling too much, but in other areas like business (he is not proud of his MBA) you can rely so much on hard data and have to sometimes act on what you think it's best, hunches, trial and error.."
2,Good Subject Spotty Execution,"Very good subject, its sort of an applied probability book with discussions on financial trading. Also some disussion of the psychology of competition. That's good stuff, but the author keeps throwing his own persona into it, and he's kind of obnoxious, to put it politely. Its like a Saturday Night Live character giving an economics class or something. But not quite as funny. If you can get past that though, it's a decent book. I'd like to read more about the subject, but by someone else."
1,"A rambling badly written, irritating book","The title sounds promising, but this book is a failure.The main problem is lack or direction. You can read pages and pages without anything interesting popping up. Ocassionaly an interesting point is raised, but you don't get the feeling that the book is leading anywhere, and therefore you don;t feel the compulsion to continue reading it.Secondly, the author has a very irritating infantile style, peppering the pages with snide remarks or comments about how smart he is.At the end of the book, you're left feeling that this might have been a vagely interesting three page magazine article, but there is not enough substance to warrant a book.Save your time - don't bother buying it."
1,Fooled By Randomness,The principal subject could have been adequately covered in a dozen pages or less. The rest of the book is just a lot of rambling. Numerous put downs of famous people that only reflected the author's lack of maturity. Also many pages of trying to convince you of his brilliance. You time and money can be better spent elsewhere.
5,Fooled by Randomness,"Superb exposé of our human proclivity to under-estimate -even disregard- randomness and the all-important and pervasive role of chance in most of our endeavors. Very uuseful guideline in a number of fields, notably medical, where we so often fall for the explanations of physicians who don't really understand statistics."
2,Yawn.,"Mr. Taleb seems to spend half the book patting himself on the back for being a trader who actually reads books. If you can put aside his annoying, self-congratulatory tone and tiresome class snobbery, you will be treated to a meandering, unfocused collection of half-developed ideas that ultimately leave you unsatisfied. I made it through half the book on the promise that something interesting was to come, but despaired soon after. Perhaps there is some great insight in the second half of the book, but I didn't think it was worth the effort to find out."
3,"Great ideas, annoying author","Nassim Taleb has to be a strong contender for the title of Most Pretentious Author of the 21st century. Despite his obnoxious writing style, he has created an interesting synthesis of existing ideas that speak powerfully to societies inability to appreciate the role of chance when looking back at events, and to underweight the probability of extremely unlikely outcomes.Unfortunately these ideas come littered with classical references, none of them properly explained, that do little to strengthen the arguments and seem to have been included only to show the author's unrelated prowess in classical literature and history. The author also relishes his self-cast role of mis-understood and sidelined academic, laughable considering all his ideas come from the mainstream academic literature (see Randall Falkenberg's blog post for full detail).On balance, Fooled by Randomness is worth reading, perhaps with Google nearby to lookup unexplained references."
2,Big Disappointment,"There is enough material in this book for one chapter. The rest is just fill consisting of the kind of writing one might put in a personal journal not intended for publication by reason of its lack of organization and poor editing. He may be a great trader but he is an inexperienced, sub-average author. Accordingly it may be sufficient to merely read the excerpts and then skip the book."
1,A Most Foolish Hypotheses if there ever was one.,"The author suggests that all success can be attributed to luck, which is absolutely untrue. I had been trading in stocks for twenty years, making money in some trades and giving it away in others. Then I can across Ben Graham's - The Intelligent Investor. It changed my whole approach to share market, and since then, in the past five years I have made more than a Million Dollars, and counting."
1,Fooled by Nassim Taleb,"I can only guess that because Mr. Taleb has written a book specifically targeted to the media's tastes (without any troublesome math or any numbers at all) he has attained a protected status that puts him outside the realm of mortals subject to criticism. His success reminds me of the Midwestern sage whose non-dividend-paying stock is at around the same price it was in March 1998 and yet who remains the ""world's most successful investor"" on countless magazine covers, TV programs and newspaper copy.That a piece of empty intellectual snobbery like ""Fooled by Randomness"" should be hailed far and wide is unfathomable except in a world bent on shallowness. If anyone who read Fooled by Randomness at its publication can summarize its conclusions with a straight face today, I would like to hear from him."
1,Author Self Love Defined,"The points this author attempts to make in this book are completely lost on the reader due to the poor quality of writing and the authors total love affair with himself. It is shame. Unless you can overcome his short falls as an author, you'll be challenged to get any value out of this book."
3,"Okay, but early part of book is a tough read","Nothing earth shattering here, but author has good ideas and information in book is definitely usefull."
2,I'm still a fool after reading this book,"PROS:* The book argues an important message (that we underestimate the role of luck in our results/outcome).* A few interesting anecdotes.CONS:* Although the author is self-deprecating at times, it smells more of false modesty rather than geniune humility (which he argues everyone should have). Most of the time (as other reviewers have noted) his arrogance comes out loud and clear, and that's annoying.* Disjointed style of writing. He rambles, jumps around, and writes in awkward sentences. The writing doesn't flow easily.* Disorganized. He proclaims that he doesn't like to use headers that tell the reader much about what is coming up. For non-fiction books, I prefer clarity, rather than cuteness.CONCLUSION: There are brief moments of brilliance and lucidness, brief moments when you think the book is really going to be worth reading, and then it quickly vanishes. Unfortunately, it's also a hard book to skim. I don't recommend it."
1,fooled by rationalization,"This book is an attempt by the author to answer the question""If you're so smart why aren't you rich?"". By dismissingplanning and insight, he is able to justify why highly intelligent academicssuch as himself are such poor investors.A disappointing diatribe."
2,Dubious,"I got this book as a gift with the comment that it will make me feel better about losing money in the stock market. I appreciate the gift, thank you Paul, but I couldn't get into this book at all. Chance happens. It isn't that hidden unless you have your head buried in the sand. Emotions happen. Contemplation happens. Discipline happens.This author seems like one confused soul. He glumps everything he can't understand, and perhaps even more, into randomness. I suppose that is useful is are writing a book! Perhaps his title should have been ""Confused By Randomness"". Fortunately he doesn't read nor appreciate book review on Amazon."
2,some interesting provocative ideas but the book is quite bad,There are some interesting ideas in the book. That's why I would give it 2 stars and not 1.Other than that the style is quite bad (IMHO of course) but the one biggest problem for me is thatthe author lacks even a single smallest drop of humility. Most of the book is about how smartthe author is and how stupid everybody else is. I did not need all that.The message of the book if there was any is lost in all this bragging.
4,more meat but not more stories,"nassim added quite a bit of meat, mostly in the back. I thought he would bring more characters and discuss events like september 11 or the nasdaq bubble, but he only added technical material. It is still fun to read."
3,Interesting reading,"It's an interesting book. Very arrogant but nontheless truthful, and it could be shortened by a hundred pages. The author delves into the classics (half dozen of them) to sound intellectual, but it is hard to justify that; he scorns this attitude several times in the book. Granted, he admits he is quite like the characters he ridicules in the book. Aside from that the book is a page-turner and fun to read."
5,"Mostly Egocentric, Always brilliant","One can witness the self-infatuated soul who, in spite of what one can expect, be incisive and insightful to the point of seeing things others don't see. I wish TAleb couldn't be a litle more humble but I guess one can't be everything.Entertaining. I could not put it down. I am convinced that the author is an egocentric fellow but with a funny attitude problem; one got to give him that he goes miles beyond other people in introspection. Bravo! Gutsy, Insightful, intelligent, and funny."
5,Same Strength and Weaknesses,"The book's weaknesses lies in the fact that 1) it is not a textbook, 2) it is not linear (more of a meditation than a treatise), 3) it is personal. Its strength also lie in that. It is entertaining and personal, and certainly not dry at all for it. Veryb unusual for such a topic usually treated by nerdy electrical engineers .It can rub some people the wrong way (the author trashes those he believes take themselves seriously but this includes himself!).At any rate Nassim says that he writes principally to entertain himself. He certainly entertained me."
5,A different way of thinking,"Just a couple of small points...First, as many have indicated, Fooled By Randomness is a bit of a prelude to The Black Swan, so I, too, highly recommend reading them in order. Reading the former is good preparation for the latter.Second, I happened to start Fooled By Randomness having just finished with A Mountain Of Silence, an exposition of Eastern Orthodox wisdom, and what a supreme coincidence it was! For me, Taleb's message that we underestimate randomness, that a lot more things are out of our control than we think, that we insist on creative reasoning to assuage ourselves that we can explain and predict events, that we should 'tinker', and that we should live aesthetically with a view to improving ourselves, is perhaps intuitive to an 'Eastern' mind, but a different way of thinking in the West."
5,if you are planning to enter the market read this book first,"Clear and honest explanation of how things really are and work in financial markets. Very useful and easy to read. You are going to have a nice evening reading this book and will save you money, if you follow its philosophy. I know, I have made myself most of the expensive mistakes you can read in the book"
2,Mundane,"If you are a quant you might find this a little slow. Some interesting ideas from a Behavioral finance perspective, but it lacks rigor. Other than lack of rigor it is a fun book to read. It has interesting examples of anomalies in rational behavior. Nassim thinks he is this great thinker, but I agree with other reviewers that he needs to work out a few more things before he gets there!"
2,"Annoying author, obvious insights","I'm not a PhD, market whiz, or have any other qualifications, however, I found every point that he made (I only got through half the book before giving up) very obvious. In fact, I had thought of the same concepts before, but never thought that it's worth writing a book about.The author is incredibly arrogant. At first, I thought he was just putting down a rival trader - a bit tongue-in-cheek, but then realized that he seems to have that attitude to anybody that isn't him.I regret paying money for this book, and wish I could get the 2 hours of my life that I wasted on it back."
3,self serving,"I found this book to be very thought provoking. In fact, I have given copies to a few friends. However, it is extremely self serving and in many places incorrect.For example, Mr. Talebs description of the scientific process is just wrong. One view is that science proceeds from a hypothesis, the world is round, to a verififiable fact, the world is round, not to a probability, there is a .98 chance the world is round. The hypothesis often is a product of intuition. The helical structure of DNA was first hypothesized and then verified, not statistically estimated.Mr. Taleb's interjection of himself really makes this more of a memoir than a treatase and leaves me with no desire to ever meet him. It crosses the border into egotism."
2,The Author Thinks He Is Better Then EVERYONE,The book has some good points and interesting thoughts but it is difficult to get by how much the author clearly thinks he is better then anyone else. This book is a way for him to get on his soap box and proclaim his greatness. Some of the points are thought provoking but all of value can be covered in many fewer pages.
2,Sequel worse than original,"This book contains a number of brilliant observations that can be quite thought provoking and that are definitely applicable to other areas. In addition, his rendition of the blow-up of a trading desk he observed personally is both colorful and, in all likelihood, accurate. However, it takes a Herculean effort to get to these nuggets of gold (most of which can be found in his first book anyway) - his oversized ego and need to validate his theory and himself personally get in the way."
3,Most has been said but . . .,"I went to a Top Tier Business School to earn my MBA - the degree that Taleb pillories. By top tier I mean top 50 not Harvard, MIT, Wharton, etc too. I learned everything that he preaches. I think he is a bit out of date.However, his message is noble if not arrogantly presented."
1,Mostly a waste of time,"If you are not too bright, you will find this book quite insightful. On the other hand, if you are of average or better intelligence, you will probably find reading this book to be, well, let's be kind and say ""inefficient"".Although the premise of book claims to be that there is a lot more unpredictability in life than people intuitively allow for, what he really argues is that the unlikely events are not as unlikely as we think (which is a slightly different point).In either case, these ideas are not even close to new with this author. They are legitimate points and it is valuable to understand them. His contribution, as an essay, would make a very fine 10 page magazine article. Instead, you have this ponderous 250 page book which is mostly an ego-fest.See also the review by ""Rossputin"" at http://www.amazon.com/review/R13UC0M0O69NXV/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm I'm in complete agreement with that review (except I only give the book 1 star)."
2,Rambling,"There is no common theme running through this book. The reader is just led along as Taleb spews forth incomplete philosophical blather, and comes across as someone who likes to hear himself speak. The reader endlessly wonders what the point is, especially after the first few chapters of the book where Taleb is constantly reminding you that he'll make his point in a later section. It becomes a lot to wade through; it could have been edited down considerably to get at his main points.However, at least he attempted to tackle the idea of randomness, which is admirable. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody. It's just too directionless."
2,Great Idea => bad book,"I agonized over how to rate this one. The idea that luck (randomness) is far more important that we give credit is very dear to me. Unfortunately, after telling us how humble he has become by studying markets, Taleb spends the rest of the book showing us how arrogant he really is. The good news is that the subject is still wide open."
2,Pompous,"Hmmm...there are so many things wrong with the ramble, that it is hard to know where to begin. Taleb is at his best when decribing traders, but as a bearish bitter put buyer who has seen all of those dream teenies go out worthless, it is disingenuous to seperate the world into niederhoffers and talebs...there are plenty of the rest of us in between, and frankly, most traders make most of their money jobbing in and out of trades over short periods of time. Also, really guy, no one cares how many times you go to the gym. Honestly...Finally, for someone who professes not to care about the media, and pseudo-academics, he has a lot of quotes on the back cover from his friends in academia and finance...coincidence, or maybe his only black swan.....PS why the trashing of MBAs...sorry Wharton was so disappointing for him, maybe he should have sold a few more puts and gone out boozing with friends a little more...."
1,Bludgeoning a point,"Nassim's point on how luck is claimed as skill would be great if supported by facts. His writing style is very anecdotal, repetitive, and hard to read. This book reads like one of those business presentations that you listen to and then wonder what you've heard after it's over."
3,"Oh, what could have been","As someone with a taste for statistical theory, this one was disappointing. Taleb is constantly casting around for what exactly he wants to write about. Yes, he passably develops his theory that people read far too much into random events. He does this through a series of personal stories, which unto themselves are entertaining. But, it's never clear if he's writing an autobiography or discussing randomness and I came away from this book no more enlightened about randomness than I had been before. If you are a novice in the area and are looking for a light introduction on the subject, it's a good book. If you're already familiar with the concept of randomness, don't bother."
1,Dreadful,Fooled by Randomness is dreadful. It's badly written and its main message states the obvious. The whole booked could be summed up as follows:The universe is ruled by chance. We all have chances but most of us: (a)don't recognise them (b)are too afraid to act (c)mistake luck for skill / intelligence.
1,"Over rated, Boring","I went into this book with high expectations, especially based on the reviews the book has gotten and the high praise heaped upon it. I don't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a book.The author provides surperficial, arrogant criticism of some people, notably traders and George Will, and paises people with superficial, poorly reasoned complements.The book is arrogant and too long, by the 10th page you could put the book down and not miss anything the author has to say."
1,Don't be fooled.,"Taleb tips us off to his game in the book. Hidden in the many pages of gibberish, he mentions how authors who have little to offer to the human knowledge base write books, and if they can get word of mouth to reach a tipping point, the book will makes lots of money. He also describes a computer program that can string words together and make it sound like intelligent points are being made while all along it is actually saying nothing. Taleb has pulled a great prank on the publishing industry and his readers. I had to buy the book for a class and Taleb took my money like so many others. He is laughing all the way to the bank.Don't be fooled by intelligent sounding titles and self proclaimed intelligent writers. Don't waste time and money on this book, both are too scarce to squander."
1,do not buy,it was recommanded by a friend. so I bought the book from amazon. but I was so disappointed.-- the content is not easy to read;-- I could not follow the author's points.-- I just do not know what he tried to say.DO NOT BUY. there are a lot better ones availabe in amazon.
1,This Book Is A Waste of Tijme!,This is book is a total waste of time. It just a lot of gibberish and doesn't make for an interesting read. The peoples that rated this anything above 1 star a delusional and sleeping with the author!
4,Life explained,"Taleb is profound. He looks at day to day events but comes up with new ways of explaining ""why"" and predicting ""what could be"". He demonstrates how poorly perception measures reality. He illuminates the dramatic role that seemingly low probability events play in shaping the future. While everyone is taught to plan for usual outcomes, he illustrates the importance of preparing for the exceptions to the rule.Taleb has brought a new perspective to the topic of measuring cause, and anticipating and preparing for effect (risk). I think his book should be a ""must read"" for any serious economics / business / philosophy student.I would also recommend reading his interview by Malcolm Gladwell for the New Yorker (easily found via Google.com)."
2,"Irritating, meandering, pompous, and sometimes interesting","It's an interesting subject -- the role of chance in the markets -- it's just too bad Taleb was too busy puffing himself up to get to it. He apparently wants to be a cross between Daniel Dennett and Richard Feyman, but he comes off instead like an insecure blowhard -- like some bore of a party guest who won't stop droning.Is there anything useful in the book? Sure, but honestly, it's not worth the effort finding those few nuggets about fat-tailed distributions and volatility inflation. Read John Allen Paulos's innumeracy series; read Peter Bernstein's ""Against the Gods"". Hey, even read some books by Dennett and Feynman, if you want. But don't waste your time on this pompous twaddle. Taleb has an insecurity streak you could spot from high-earth orbit -- and it obscures his entire book."
4,Thought provoking read on the probability of extreme events,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It served to remind me of the meaning of the saying ""I'd rather be lucky than smart."" The author offers a number of descriptive examples of highly unlikely events that have occurred--contradicting consenus opinion."
2,Important ideas badly presented (but see these better books),"Let's ignore the author's obvious eagerness to show us how much smarter than everyone else around him he is, and how ""cool"" he is by being unconventional. The core ideas he attempts to present ARE important, but he does them a disservice by his scattershot explanations and disjointed examples. This wouldn't be so bad if he was presenting new ideas or theories, but he is mostly simply rehashing rather old thoughts.To be more positive, here are some books that cover many of the same topics but in much clearer and more entertaining ways: ""Inevitable Illusions : How Mistakes of Reason Rule Our Minds"" by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, ""How to Lie with Statistics"" by D. Huff, and most anything by John Allen Paulos."
4,Intellectual fun,A personal and philosophical exploration of how to enjoy living in the world with less certainly. A serious work that does not take itself seriously.
2,Phil Cox,"Far too weighted with financial world references. Lacks the broader insights, revelations and brilliant style of his Black Swan masterpiece."
2,could have been..better,"the lesbian scenes were bad. could have been more to it, better acting, more scenes, more love. ugh waste of time watching. paint scene is only worth rewinding over and over."
2,Better off just renting it!,"I purchased this flick an Easter gift because I was hoping that the title would hold true. I was disappointed. I realize that it was an independent movie and doesn't share the same money scale as a big time Hollywood flick BUT it was also lacking in a quality plot not to mention good acting. The basic idea behind the movie is two lesbians have to keep their relationship a secret when one of their mother's comes to live with her. The mother turns out to be a wacko in her own right. The movie is not short on lesbians, bisexuals or tranvestites but it is short on the charm that would have brought the package together. There were a few parts where I laughed (one would hope in a 2 hour period a movie could accomplish that) but on a whole I was watching my watch and the chapter tracks to see how much more of the movie was left. Boy I wish I could get my twenty bucks back!"
1,Pretty Bad!!,After reading the raving reviews I expected this to be a great movie with some erotic scenes. Wrong! It was pretty bad. Lots of stereotypical dykes and no attractive women at all. Terrible love scenes with no chemistry and the misperception that lesbians are all a bunch of butches and have sex toys just lying around everywhere for anyone to find. Yuck! This is the kind of movie that gives lesbianism a bad image. Do yourself a favor and rent GIA instead. It's a much better movie and the love between the women seemed much more believable.
1,One dimensional and cliché-ridden,"Rarely have I seen a movie this bad. I wanted to like it and kept waiting for it to redeem itself, but it didn't. The characters are flat and the story line is predictable and slightly annoying."
1,could have been..,"This movie could have been so much better, but it was marketed for more than its worth. The subplots make more sense than the main girls in the movie. The two lead characters basically make out then fight, then get back together again. boring !"
5,what a flick,"Unlike the reviewer above, I LOVED this movie and think it is one of the best Lesbian films ever made. As most of you know, Lesbian movies can be somewhat ""cheesy"" (for lack of a better word-you know, bad lighting, bad acting, bad film quality) but they seem to be improving and this is the proof. What I thought was the movie's high points WERE it's sub-plots of gay bashing, censorship and discrimination w/in our own gay community. Over all: see it and soon"
3,"harmless, not good, entertainment","I'll keep this short: while I agree that a lot of lesbian film making is sub par, I also am tired of people whining because every lesbian film that comes out isn't a deep, serious thoughtful meditation on gender theory and what it's like to be opressed... jeez. Sometimes you just wanna watch a lighthearted, slightly crappy, romantic comedy. That's what this film is. Deep and challenging it is not. That's ok. When I want to watch a cheesy romantic comedy, i'd rather watch one about girls than a regular str8 one.... wouldn't you?my biggest complaint is that there are NO people of color in this movie. I mean, come on! I know there are people of color in Canada!!"
5,Fun - Romance - Misscommunication,"From the start this film is funny. Much of what happens is predictable, but the quirky characters are halarious. It makes you rethink cliches' at the same time it pokes fun at them. Its a fun film."
4,Refreshing,"I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this DVD. I found the descriptions here varied and inconclusive. When I slid it into the player and sat back, I was immediately enthralled by the hard edge opening music, playing in the forground while entertainers lip-sync'd at a dance club. I found the movie to be a refreshing change from the often style over substance Hollywood films I usually watch.Christina Cox in my mind was the stand out in this movie, down-playing her obvious beauty for her role in the film. The body painting scene was both beautiful and erotic and betrayed Christine's subtle attempt to appear unattractive.The DVD itself was not loaded with extras, however Anne Wheeler's commentary was highly informative and as objective as possible. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a change of pace. It was funny and innovative."
2,"contrite and oh, so predictable","... The plot is too predictable and the actors underwhelming as was the characters themselves. The speed with which they hook up with one another gives new meaning to the u-haul joke. And the sex scenes were sadly lacking as well. They had very poor chemistry and their ""passion"" for one another seemed entirely forced ..."
5,Wish There Was More...,"I absolutely love this movie!! But the things that really disturbed me was the sex scenes. The scenes get you going just to get interrupted. The part that I thought was the sexiest was the body paint. The way they painted their bodies showed how much you can make a love scene art. I think they showed how in all actuallity it can be hard to come out especially to your mother. But yet I don't know if anyone has to deal with a mother as annoying. The movie is great and will be one of all time favorites. Even the sex scenes don't show great detail or that they get interrupted its enough to get me going. I think its a beautiful thing between two woman who love each other (yet a little too quick, but hey). A deffinate recommended movie!!! :-)"
2,It's okay,"Not one of my favorite Lesbian movies, but I ordered it because everyone said I should own a copy. It was a typical so-so movie...cute chick mets another cute chick, they fall in love, both have issues that tear them apart, they get back together.he movie tends to deal with prejudice in its forms...and the message is...prejudice is BAD. And we hear it over and over and over again.My favorite character was the transgendered mtf. S/he made the film interesting, otherwise it was a so-so film."
5,One of the most sensual movies i've seen,"My finace and I rented this movie on impulse from lightly reading it. needless to say, we were glued to the screen the whole time. the love aspect in it is played out well. some of the erotic seens could have used work as you could tell that some parts appeared to be forced. but other than that, it was excellent. being able to relate to these type of movies, i enjoyed it very much so."
5,So So Sweet,"I loved the plot, the film was well put together, it wasn't overly artistic but still had some nice shots. The love scenes were well done..."
5,a real crowd pleaser,"What a movie. Even though the romance between the two main characters was rushed it didn't seem to lack that certain something that makes it believable.It was funny,touching and it even brought to life issues I had never thought of. Everyone around me seemed to be talking about it, gay or straight, they all said they loved it."
2,"Nah, chocolate is way better than this.","Though the film is notable for the presence of Ann Marie Macdonald, an actress who is also the superb author of ""Fall on Your Knees"" (an Oprah book club selection) who also played an on screen lesbian in a better Canadian film, ""I've Heard The Mermaids Singing."""
2,Not as Good as Chocolate.,"This movie was a weak attempt to cram every lesbian trope into 90 minutes. The performance was over-acted, the plot quite thin and seemingly unfeasible. However, the attempt to address issues of transgender/trans-sexual women in the lesbian community was a much needed, and fairly well executed, highlight in this otherwise oversimplified film."
5,Best Movie,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Anne Wheeler does an exceptional job of capturing the raw emotion and love that is expressed throughout the entire movie between all characters. My favorite scene is when Kim and Maggie actually meet, which is when Kim is sketching a portrait. The eye contact, facial expressions, and body language makes the viewer desperate to be one of those two women. The chemistry which flows between them is fantastically recorded and makes love, any kind of love, a seeming joy to be a part of. I consider myself priveleged to not only have seen the movie, but also to now own the DVD, which I bought on a whim. I am positive that anyone else who values the art of making film will also appreciate how wonderful this film is. This will be one of my top five films in my collection for life."
3,Enjoyable,"Movies are for entertainment and this movie does just that. It scratches the surface of many different issues we face today, yet maintains a light enough story line to keep it funny and interesting. The cast of actors are attractive and you can identify parts of their characters with people you know. The music ensemble was good too."
3,Not bad at all...,"I am an early 40s male and this DVD was bit out of character for me to buy. To be perfectly honest I was originaly looking for another movie with a similiar title when I found it. After reading the reviews though I thought it might be worth a look and I was right. I won't get into the devlopement of the characters or anything like that, nor will I discus the sex scenes. I will simply say that it was a fun if rather adult in subject matter movie that gave me a couple of good laughs. The story seemed believable and the humor was a little more sophisticated and better thought out than most of the comedies we see today. It is not a great masterpiece and I don't associate it as being anything ground breaking in the way of lesbian or homesexual rights. The fact that the main characters are lesbian and/or of ""Alternative life style"", seemed secondary to the story."
2,Come together right now,"I am always amazed by the range of stars that are appliedby the reviewers. This frenetic little movie might titilate youa little or a lot, or become so grating that you just wishit would end. There are some moments in itthat are palatable --- but the wrap-up is so screwy --- theporn shop nude scene, the skinheads, and the explosion,just before all of the chicks manage to have happy endingsand just ahead of the longest lesbian kiss ever --- that hadme fast-forwarding.Christina Cox is a pip."
1,Too much chocolate makes people puke,"Does anybody remember what morals are? If you liked this movie, I guess not."
4,Better than chocolate,"Funny, sexy and charming tale of gay love. Christina Cox and Karen Drywer look suited for each other. Wendy Crewson does a very excellent portrayal of Lila, the visiting mother. You'll laugh when she finds ther object under the bed and out that Judy is a transexual. Dissapointed to find the Anne Wheeler interview isn't inculded on the director's cut version. I wish I had the courage Maggie had at her age."
4,Mmmmm Chocolate,"A great film that explores a budding romance, relations with parents who don't know, and then the struggle against censorship. Some amazing scenes with body paining, and a live naked window display. Explores some anti-GLBT issues as well. Over all one of my favorite movies."
5,Chocolate,"Definately one of the best lesbian movies of all time. A very cute romantic comedy about two girls falling in love. Although there are some classic stareotypes, not many pose a big threat. This is a very effective tale that makes you want to watch it over and over. Keep an eye out for the beatiful Kim (Christina Cox)."
5,One of My Favorites,"This movie is one of my favorites. The movie itself is at the same time romantic, sweet, funny, uplifting, and heartbreaking. I will always enjoy this movie and I'm sure most others will, too. HIGHLY recommended."
4,Better than Chocolate,It was a good movie about open people and good relationships. Some times it takes a tragity to see how importent life and relationships are. I thought the movie was good and would recommend it to others.
2,SO SO,This is a movie that I though would be interresting to view with my special someone bu when we looked at it we waited for the plot and the what's next in the movie...it was just too predicatable with no organization to the story line. SO its truly not a buy rent it rather if you can find it or borrow it from someone.
4,Why Not?,I bought this movie trying to build up my lesbian movie collection and have since watched the movie a few times. It's a great movie. The actors aren't well known but they are pretty good... I guess what I'm trying to say is good movie.
2,Better than chocolate?,"It's always nice to see a lesbian flick with some steamy scenes and cute girls, but it's better when there is a good story line. This movie's plot is unbelievable, is unconvincingly serious at times, and poorly acted. It's a decently fun light date movie, but lacks substance as it tries to have deeper meanings and dwell in social and politcal issues. This movie was fun to watch, but offers nothing more than a few decent bedroom scenes and a failed attempt at a powerful movie. It's a mediocre romantic comedy that tries to accomplish too much. I recommend seeing it, but don't pay too much or expect great filmmaking."
2,low standards,"reading these reviews, i can only come to one conclusion. lesbians have really low standards for movie content as long as we can see two girls rolling around naked in paint.btw, it wasnt all that erotic, anyhow."
4,"Coming out is ... ""better than chocolate""","Love is exposing yourself to different experiences in life, such as that of coming out, and letting yourself love. What is better than chocolate, if you are a fiend, and find chocolate as addicting as love? Expose yourself here to a cute movie who will what is ""better than chocolate."""
3,Trannies make everything better.....,"The movie was alright. The best part was Judy the lesbian tranny. She was a fun, sweet character. The rest of the movie was..... eh, kinda gross at times. I mean, i bought it, so ill probably watch it again, but if id seen it in a theater, i wouldnt rush out and buy it. Just a story about two women falling in love and one trying to hide it from her mom, which the other girl hates. If you want a movie with a better, yet still remotely similar, and more..... ""appetizing"" story line, i suggest ""I can't think straight"" with Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth."
2,Surprised but not Surprising,"The label on the movie is overdone very much. ONLY buy this movie if your looking for a good lesbian dramatic movie.Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) & Kim (Christina Cox) are both wonderful in the movie. It just wasn't what I expected it to be.[one review] says its: ""SEXY! DELIGHTFULLY EROTIC!"" After reading that review, I don't know about you but I'm looking for something a bit more than drama, and its not there."
1,I'd rather have chocolate,"I thought a good way to pick a good movie was to read other peoples opinions. Obviously I have different tastes than everyone else, because I thought the movie was not only unsexy, but it was incredibly boring and unbelieveable.There was nothing interesting about the main characters. You didn't get attached or involved in any way. I could not believe you could fall in love and move-in together in the space of a few days.There were too many story lines going at once to be able to give a damn about any of them. The two main characters had about as much heat together as a couple earthworms. I just didn't buy the whole thing!"
2,ehh,"I was sooo excited to watch this movie, I read all the reviews, and it was the top 5 on everyone's favorite lesbian movie list. I didn't like the movie. the plot was all over the place.. and the characters werent developed. i guess i went into the movie with way too high expectations.. cuz i was definietly disappointed. HOWEVER, the sex scenes were pretty good, not excellent, but.. I did have to watch them a few times =)"
3,Better than Chocolate,"A good honest film about young love, well worth sitting down to watch. You could even enjoy it with your partner, what ever relationship your in."
3,"Coming of Age, Coming Out, Coming to Terms","This is an eclectic movie about several people coming to terms with being in love, being single, dating outside their norm, etc... etc... Everyone deals with different realities everyday, and this movie is just an example of what kinds of realities exist. Definitely not for young viewers."
3,"could be better, could be worse","the fast moving relationship between the two main characters was a bit unbelievable, but i was willing to suspend my disbelief in this case. the acting wasn't bad. the characters weren't that deep, but i don't generally expect a whole lot of depth from a romantic comedy. rather, i hope to be entertained and this movie did that. won't change the world, but was a well done, entertaining dyke movie where the ladies actually get it on."
5,Better,"Maybe this one movie should have a 3 star, because it is, kinda, outdated and a little bit blured, but it is a GREAT movie with LOTS of giggles and laughs....Great movie for aduilts, only....VERY SWEET, INDEED...I need to rate this, R or PG, only....GREAT actors!!!!!"
3,chocolate,Don't remember getting it -- must have been a gift - sorry I didn't let you know something sooner - thanks
2,do not waste your time and money on this one,a very slow and uninteresting movie tried to get interested but just did not work. there are plenty of other good movies outthere.
3,Main story is disappointing but is surpassed by a subplot.,"It's billed as a funny romp that starts when a girl's brother and bitter mother move into her small apartment just as she's been swept off her feet by a new lesbian artist passing through town. Mom's a bit of a downer until she discovers a box of sex toys and learns of a few activities that are more satisfying than her choclate addiction. Brother is finding a few new thrills as well, but the subplot of a pre-op transexual accepting herself and being accepted by the love of her life is the best part, I think. I'm not sorry I have it, but I wouldn't rush to replace it if it was lost."
4,"Fun, sexy, diverse.","Quirky and a lot of fun! The diverse characters and their stories are entertaining. The two young women falling for each other, and going through all the tumultuous highs and lows reminds us of how much fun it was to be a young lesbian! Sexy!"
5,EVERYone should see this movie,"I was amazed. Better than Chocolate manages to come through where so many films in this vein tend to fall short. For everyone, it provides a glimpse into the lesbian experience - minus the in your face sexual content or stereotypes found in other films. It portrays regular people leading thier crazy everyday lives, and it works from beginning to end. Funny, Sad, Informative, and Sweet, Better Than Chocolate is a fabulous film that never fails to entertain."
3,A movie or porn?,In my opinion this movie is more of a soft porn flick. The story line is a little difficult to follow and about every twenty or so minutes a new sex scene pops up. Not that I'm complaining :) but the storyline and movie could've been better.
3,Nightfighters,"The movie, Night Fighters, focuses on African Americans in the Air Force, during WWII. It also focuses on how the African American Air Force pilots faced segregation and humiliation during the war. They interviewed the pilots that were in this Air Force squadron. These African Americans were very brave and thoughtful. The African Americans acted bravely, because they wanted to gain respect from a country that didn't consider them before. The Black Air Force pilots were very heroic and honoring to their country. - Philip."
3,nightfighters,Charles Yoo 2-4-02Computers prd.7NightfightersNight fighters was a compelling story of the racism between the African-Americans and whites. This movie taught the watchers about what the African-Americans had to go through in order to be a pilot. Some of the problems that the African-Americans had was that they were treated inferior then the whites. Since the whites were considered superior then the African-Americans at the time they did the best to get them out of the aviation school because they thought that were not smart enough or because they do not have what it takes to become a fighter pilot. But the African-Americans proved them wrong by flying their plans over Africa amd escorting the American bombers in Europe. In conclusion because of this movie us viewer can see what the African-Americans went through to become a pilot.
4,Nightfighters is a fine documentary,"This documentary is extraordinary in that it includes interviews from not only the fighter pilots but the bomber airmen they protected. Further, it highlights the talented, dedicated and successful black Americans who fervently wished to help win the war. I couldn't wait to share this video with my pilot friends. Well done."
5,Great To See Black Pilots,This is great history about black pilot. Look at this and then The Tuskegee Airmen.
4,Epistemology - not so difficult to follow,"Epistemology was an assigned read for a master's level course. After scanning the text, I became concerned that this was going to be a boring and difficult read. This was not the case. The topic is actually very relatable to daily life and very interesting. I highly recommend Epistemology for anyone interested in learning more about what we believe and how we come to form those opinions.(Christian based)"
4,Another solid read from Bede,"As in all his other books Bede will challenge your views of religion and Christianity. He takes a view even beyond that commonly called ecumenical to show that the underlying spirit of all religions merge in the realm of the mystic. This is another solid read worthy of your time. I also recommend the CDs and Books of Bede's protoge Russill Paul as inThe Yoga of Sound: Tapping the Hidden Power of Music and Chant,Jesus in the Lotus: The Mystical Doorway Between Christianity and Yogic Spirituality, andShabda: Mantra Mysticism"
3,"Point does dull, and it gets dry after awhile","This eye pencil is just alright. I think the description that you never have to sharpen it is a little misleading, because as you use it the point gets dull as then it does need sharpening to glide on close enough to the eyelash. When I first used it, it was very good but I found after like a month it just didnt look as good when I put it on.Then I went to urbandecay.com and got the 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in zero and it is amazzzingg. Ive been using it for months now and its consistently glides on with ease. It has a lot more moisture and is creamier, therefore easier to put on than this one was. If ur looking for a good eyepencil, deff go with urban decay."
2,"OKay,..kinda","The suction cups wouldn't stick anywhere in our house, especially not in the tub. The bag is okay, but I ended up getting a completely different one."
4,Those helpful readings can really change you & your spouse!,"120 helpful, scripture-centered devotionals will help different types of couples to learn how to be great, spiritual friends! This book is an excellent resource!"
4,Very pleased,The condition of the video was excellent. It was shipped and received in a very timely manner.
3,I love this show but not everything,I love this show and when I was a kid I was watching it all of the time! I was looking forward to buy some DVD that will include all the seasons. I ordered this one and got so disappointed because there are just a show on 50 minutes and that is it!!!!!!!!!I still remember many of them that are not on this DVD
1,"0 stars, if possible.","Wow, what a piece of junk! It's as though the nut-job on the corner with a ""The end is near"" sign was given keys to the History Channel studios. How about raising the bar a little? I know that scaring people sells DVD's, but don't you think it is your duty to to give rational experts some time on the subject. I'm a science teacher and I'm constantly having to correct misconceptions propagated by the History Channel. Unfortunately, I have to remind my students to not believe everything they see on TV!"
4,Excellent Resource,This book is a great resource. It has enough material to use directly or for inspiration. It helped me generate a lot of my own ideas along with using ideas from the book. Some of the information can be for any type of retreat.
4,Looking for a more uplifting retreat,The book has given me a few good ideas however I was looking for something that was a bit more fresh. I am sure all of the ideas would work but I just wanted something more lively.
4,latin Jazz meets expiramental art rock,"Ive been a fan of Euphone for a couple years, and I picked this up, their latest release at amoeba music. this album is solid.tracks 5, 7 are more like the old Euphone. ambient and bassy, slow but calculatedtracks 1 and 4 are more like a new band- cha cha surf guitars.Track 2 Tools of love has breathy vocals, so does 4.3 is really insane nu-jazzI enjoy it, its not my favorite euphone record. im waiting for another full length from them, perhaps they will develop the lead guitar sound hinted at in ""lakewood burning bad boy"" and Homodulations"" while avoiding the campy ""surf"" sound.Ryan rhapsys has been joined by bass player Nick Marci and keyboardist Jeremy Jacobson (who does a great job on track 3 baldwin wipeout)for fans of Tortoise and Sparta, maybe for fans of the Dylan Group too. or fans of Coltrain, after all track 6 is a rendition of Countdown."
5,compelling,"A role model because of her age, sex, and faith. I didn't find out much about Alaska but was captured by her involvement in her world. It was a different time. Could her experiences be repeated today?"
2,Good for Maztica Campaigns,"I very much enjoyed the first Map Folio - it gave a variety of well drawn, well colored maps suitable either for DM use or player reference. In buying the second in the series though, I may have erred. The quality is still excellent - it's the variety that suffered. Almost all the maps deal with sections and buildings of an Aztec-like fortress city. While this would be great for a Maztica campaign, or a single CoC adventure, it lacks the broad verstaility that the previous map folio did.If you can use a ruined Maya city in your campaign, buy this. If not, take a pass."
1,Disappointing,"In the first place, contrary to the information above, this product consists of 32 maps, not 64. And that's all you get: maps, with no information as to how they fit together.Five of the maps link together to form an overland map, but there is no indication of where the city lies in relation to this. There is no overhead rendition of the city to show how it fits together. The placement of only two of the included buildings is obvious; where the other two fit is anyone's guess. Worst of all, one seven-level building is included without any hint as to how the levels fit together. Each unnumbered level has a stairway, but none of them seem to match up; the King's Temple has the architectural logic of an Escher print.In addition, the back cover copy promises ""labyrinthine tunnels""; there are no tunnels at all included in this folio.This was a very disappointing purchase. You might as well spend the time drawing up your own maps as puzzling out how these maps are supposed to fit together."
5,An excellent gathering of fun projects,"The host of 'Knitty Gritty' here provides playful, unique designer knits geared to kids' needs in New Knits On The Block, an excellent gathering of fun projects. From a pirate theme bath set to a knitted dress for an Egyptian dress-up theme or a tool set and pouch for the older boy, New Knits holds some truly innovative ideas the most modern child will appreciate."
2,Total Kitsch,"I'm an avid knitter of children's clothing and am always looking to add to my library of cool, updated knitting books and patterns for kids. Unfortunately, I found the patterns in this book to be completely kitschy...none of them are ones I'd make myself for my daughters or as gifts for friends.There are patterns for costumes (knights, mermaids, capes) and a couple for toys that are nice to look at (blocks, bowling set), but I think this book might be better marketed towards KIDS interested in knitting, rather than towards adults interested in gifts for kids."
1,Found this at the dollar store...,"I found this book at my local dollar store and being a knitter, I thought I hit the jackpot. I was soo wrong. I quickly flipped through the book in the store but did not take time to really look at the projects. I figured, with a 3 and a half year old boy at home, I would be able to find at a couple cool patterns in here. Yet, everything I have seen in here has made me burst into laughter. Beside 1 or 2 patterns for girls (a purse, and an illusion backpack) there is nothing at all in this book worth knitting. I am not sure who would spend the time knitting a plush tool set and pouch which is shown being worn on an 11 year old boy in the book... or a knit hat and eye patch that is shown being worn in the bathtub?? Honestly, my husband and I looked through the book and thought the same thing about all the projects. I guess for only a dollar, it was at least worth the laugh."
4,"fun, fun, fun","If you knit for little children, you'll find lots of fun costumes in this book to make for boys and for girls."
3,It's ok,"I wasn't really that impressed. I liked the wizard's hat but that was about all. I don't think alot of the patterns are really geared for kids, but again this is just my opinion."
2,Fairy tooth pillow,"Actually, after reading the directions for thew fairy tooth pillow, I found it did not suit my needs.I sent the book back."
3,Synthpop it is,"I recently purchased this CD based on a a song I of theirs I found on a compilation. But all I can say is that this CD was a let down.The music is good, and a few tracks spark my interest but on the whole the lyrics are less then engaging, and most of the tracks are mediocre. They really just sound average."
4,A mix,"I'm new to De/vision. The sound is like listening Depeche Mode, New Order and Camouflage, all in a mix."
3,"Good, but with room to grow","I was overall very pleased with this book. It offers very novice information in layman's terms about the Neo-Pagan perspective and different sects of beliefs. But there was still very much to be desired, and their section on Wicca was not only ill-informed but very fluffy and vague. So this is DEFINITELY not the source for information about Wicca, of any origin or lineage.All around, for the price I got it for, it was a good buy but I'm very sure there are other books that are just as good, if not better."
1,What a difference a year makes.,"A year ago, I would have described this book as a valuable resource for a person new to Paganism and trying to find a path. Over the last year I have made more of an effort to learn about the differences between the various Neopagan religions and now find this book does not do justice to the real diversity of thought and practice that exists. In fact, this book does what many Neopagans do, which is attempt to homogenize Paganism into some universal religion with different flavored sects. The book is weak and ultimately deceptive."
1,like an endless maze,"This program is like an endless maze. The sections run together without a definite transition from one to the other. Instead of flowing from one concept into another like a book, the program makes you click from here to there. There are so many things to click on each page that you never quite know if you've hit them all. Asterisks, video lessons, highlighted text, underlined concepts, the list goes on and on...there is no way to tell when you've completed everything on a page before you flip to the next...did I miss something?? I don't know. The companion text, which we were required to have, is nothing more than black and white copies of everything on the CD, including pictures. What a confusing mess!"

4,maglucifent,A very good addition to my daughters collection of Lucy items. A good look at the past when there was not the technical inovations that exist now
2,Can't rate what I don't have!,"I ordered I Love Lucy Seceond Season in August, but as of today HAVE NOT received my merchandise.This item was NOT out stock, so I am confused as to the delay, since all other products I have ordered from Amazon have arrived in a timely manner.Also ordering certain items on Amazon, have been MOST difficult in finding the correct merchandise that I want. Also I had to return damaged merchandise, and so far have heard NOTHING on my order, refund, or any communication from Amazon.Right now, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in Amazon.Cheryl Henninger"
3,Missing episodes in season 2,"Well for the most part i appreciate having this series in my library. However i've looked through all the seasons and I cannot find the episode where Lucy tells Ricky she's expecting a baby. Another episode is missing as well as the first episode to a two parter. (Tennese Ernie Ford Hangs on).To sell season two as a season is a joke on Amazon's behalf and a rip off to people who want the entire season.Still if you know these are missing, it is still worth buying just to have."
5,I Love Lucy; timeless!,"Lucille Ball brings on just as many laughs today as she did decades ago. Fortunately, this set includes one of my favorites: the episode with Lucy & Ethel boxing chocolates. The set was a birthday present for an 8-year-old, but all the family has enjoyed watching."
3,2nd sesason lucy,"i am a big ""I love Lucy"" fan, and the second season did not disappoint,however. The second season has a lot of my favorite episodes that i will watch over and over again, but it also had a few i didn't like.This is a classic.."
2,dvd,"FIRST DVD CASE TABS BUSTED, AND FIRST DVD NOT PLAYING PROPERLY, BEST SHOW IS FIRST ONE WIFE NOT HAPPY,X-MAS PRESENT,ME TOO."
5,I LOVE the I Love Lucy show,"I have been very satisfied buying products from this seller. I know what I want and I just buy it. The pricing is Excellent! The I Love Lucy show is very, very, funny without the smutty stuff that you have these days. This show proves you can be funny and decent at the same time."
5,My mistake,I orded the wrong season of the I love lucy as a gift and it was sent out so fast that I could not cancel It. I quickly ordered the correct one.When I sent back my mistake it was so easy. I was sent an email letting me know they had recieved it and credited my card. No hassle what so ever. VERY SATISFIED!!!
2,This is new?!,"The outside cover was wrinkled and crinkled and loose as heck. It seemed like it was years old. I ordered a new one, but the outside seemed very old. I was surprised the cd's weren't scratched."
2,Was fun while it lasted,"We bought this for my son's birthday. He loved (5 stars) it until... after about 15 minutes, it no longer bumped and went. (1 star) It just ran in place. I'll have to return it to the store and try again.I would have rated the ""How much fun is this toy?"" higher if it had actually worked. When the car was running correctly it was FANTASTIC! Too bad that didn't last."
2,"A little credit, please...","I bought this book for a friend when we graduated from college. This was for a person who couldn't cook a chicken breast, scramble an egg, or fry bacon. Anything involving more than a freezer and a microwave was out of his realm of capabilities. This book was too elementary for him. I understand that there are people who have hardly stepped foot in a kitchen, but do they really not even understand that you shouldn't buy your fruit bruised, or need a schematic diagram of a blender? It's probably my own fault for misunderstanding the meaning of the word ""Beginner,"" but this book seems geared more for a 12-year-old than a college graduate."
4,Three old pros,"The first few times I listened to this album, I was somewhat disappointed. It's grown on me a lot since then. Sonically it's quite similar to the trio's previous album on ECM,I Have the Room Above Her. There's lots of sophisticated, subtle interplay between the three musicians, but with a mellower, less explosive sound than their albums on JMT/Winter&Winter; and Soul Note. Don't expect any squealing electric guitar by Frisell or free jazz screaming by Lovano.Favorite tracks: some nice free-ish jousting on ""Onetwo"", the very melodic ""K.T."", and Thelonious Monk's very funny ""Light Blue"". ""In Remembrance of Things Past"" is nice, but doesn't hold a candle to the very intense version recorded onTrioism.I'd check out I Have the Room Above Her or some of their albums on JMT/W&W; before this one, but if you like those albums then you will probably appreciate this one as well."
4,Eerie,"Doug loves his family. He's been a wonderful father to his step daughters and he does his best to keep his family safe and happy. Daughter Erin reaches out for comfort from teen angst and finds all the wrong influences. Doug must enter a dark, surrealistic world to save his family; he is taken to the utmost limits to see how far he will go for the people he loves.Etchison is an amazing horror writer. His work is always a treat, and this novel does not disappoint. Be warned: this is a dark story with a not-so-uplifting message. Still, to get your hands on anything written by an author recommended by Stephen King, Charles Grant, Peter Straub, etc. is definitely worth the effort."
3,The Littlest Secret,"Single mom Kara Taylor was bristling for a showdown. Her dad had gone and gambled away the family ranch, forcing Kara to confront the new owner to reclaim her son's birthright. But that owner happened to be Ty Murdock, the no-good cowboy who'd long ago left Bootlick for the rodeo...and unwittingly, a pregnant Kara.Deal with the handsome devil Kara would - for her son's sake. But marry him? Yet that was Ty's astonishing offer to make Kara's little cowboy his heir. Close proximity would make resisting Ty's charm and raw appeal next to impossible. Even worse, he had no idea that her son was his...and that tiny secret could lead to Texas-size trouble!"
4,Dozens of rare photos highlight this history of baseball.,"Dozens of rare photos highlight this history of baseball.There are also classic stories of great victories andcrushing defeats; of the greats of the game; and of theballparks in which they played and coached.A great primer for the young baseball fan, and a greatrefresher for fans wanting to brush up on their baseballhistory."
3,Voila,"This is a mixture of old standards with a twist, fresh funky beats, with a touch of early French radio. I hadn't set to purchase this CD, but it was recommended. As it turns out I liked this selection and wished that I had not wasted money on my original selection. Jazz A Saint Germain has a couple of songs that I can do without, but overall I liked it."
4,Your own Paris speakeasy,"This is an intimate, eclectic vocal collection that has been getting alot of play at my place. Now that you're tired of all those lounge reissues you've been playing at cocktail time, try switching over to this. Smooth, smoky, and just the right amount of vermouth."
3,Entertaining and offbeat,"Sometimes you feel this CD is channeling the 40s and 50s, and sometimes it seems to be deconstructing the period and its sound, but it's almost always fun to listen to. I admit I needed time to warm up to it, but track 2 blew me away the first time I really paid attention to the bloodthirsty lyrics set to a funky death march. As a francophone, I enjoy it when I'm in the mood for hearing French, though Patricia Kaas or Paris Combo offer more subtle and sophisticated visions, if you can use that term for song. My only complaint is Debbie Harry's abominable French accent and her Ohio-flat American ""r"" spoiling a lovely song. I love her, am an old Blondie fan, but girlfriend should stay away from singing French."
2,Disappointing,I got this because I like jazz and Pink Martini. I'm pretty disappointed. I guess I was expecting something different. I'm not that thrilled with the vocalists. The arrangements strike me as odd. Several tracks are a lot more electronic than I was expecting. I was shooting for something more natural and recreative of a scratchy Paris-in-the-50s jazz album.
4,Jazz A Saint-Germain - Sublime easy listening,"This CD provides an eclectic selection of suprises. Easy to listen to, with quirky undertones from well known artists."
3,thoughtless selection,"I wouldn't quibble if the original albums were still easily available. This selection represents David Bowie's music very poorly. The only really worthy songs included here are ""The Man Who Sold the World"" (from the album of the same name), ""Changes"", ""Life on Mars"" (both from ""Hunky Dory""), and ""Aladdin Sane"" (the title song from its album). Most notably missing are ""An Occasional Dream"" (from ""Space Oddity""), ""After All"" (from ""The Man Who Sold the World""), ""Five Years"", ""Soul Love"" (both from ""Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars""), ""Time"" (from ""Aladdin Sane""), and ""We Are the Dead"" from (""Diamond Dogs""). Try to find the original albums or demand their re-release.Also recommended (for guitarists too): PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
1,Ka-ching!,"No, that wasn't a sample from one of Bowie's more avant garde songs; rather, it's the unmistakable sound of a cash register joyfully accepting your hard-earned cash in return for this totally unnecessary compilation, which exists only to line the pockets of The Rich White Duke."
2,An early attempt at a Star Trek novel.,"Spock becomes the God, thereby breaking all his characters usual tenets.The first few novels written in Star Trek's dark years (1975-79) did not conform to any timeline, set rules, or plot lines. This actually made them refreshing in a way."
3,blind mountain,"This is a good movie, but it's not what I expected. It has all the making of a good exploitation movie but it isn't. the plot is good and the acting is good. It's not low budget. But if your looking for women being exploited then this is not the movie you want. I recommend star of david beauty hunting for exploitation. This movie is a more of a drama."
3,Australian Gold has always been a terrific brand in tanning.,"However, this is not one of their best products.But to each their own.I first purchased Iced Creme when I was in Highschool. It has a nice scent, and feels great on your skin in a warm tanning booth/bed, but im not the biggest fan of cooling lotions.From what I remember, I got pretty dark with this, but had been using other products before it, so im not sure if that had anything to do with it.After this one, I went to Australian Gold Cheeky Brown and LOVED it!"
4,Travolta Fan!,"Always enjoyed Travolta movies. He doesn't surprise in this one--shows his wise_ _ _ personality with some ""cool"" in it. Travolta plays a government operative sent in as ""the last resort"" to eliminate a terrorist cell in Paris. Rhys Meyers plays an American ambassador's aide and a straight-shooting, entry-level operative thrown together with Travolta and unaware of their objective. Their adventure takes them through the streets and neighborhoods of Paris trying to find clues that will lead them to their objective. I found it to be hilarious, entertaining and filled with just enough action scenes. Great for movie night on the couch."
4,about this film from paris with love.............,"Singapore theatre had shown this film and its a very nice film with lots of actions which is rated as M18...I have viewed this on theatre and gave it a 4 star for this nice action film/movie.........:-)Reviewed by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Ron Howard - Ang Poon Kah for film Da Vinci CodeAssistant FED chief (Internationale)"
4,"Wax on, wax off!","This is movie is just plain fun. Travolta and Rhys-Meyers are a great team-up. Travolta is an over-the top, larger-than-life super agent, Rhys-Meyers is an ambassador's aide who wants to break into field operations. They're teamed up to stop a terrorist plot in Paris. The story is fun, the action is a blast to watch, and the character interaction during the developing partnership is fun if not very deep. Overall, it's well worth watching--more than once if you're the type that can watch movies more than once."
3,Nothing Special,"Good action-packed movie. Travolta fans will not be disappointed, although his performance is essentially a walk-through. Script is weak with few surprises - except for one involving a supporting actress, Kasia Smutniak, who turns out to be the most interesting character in the film. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, (as an inept ""Robin"" to Travolta's ""Batman"")is unconvincing in his role.If you are looking for a temporary Travolta action fix this may be the DVD you might want to consider purchasing."
3,A slightly better than average action film (3.5 stars),"1. This was recommended via a coworker and it's a solid action film, perhaps a bit more entertaining than the usual fare, but that's about it.2. The acting (esp John Travolta)--> entertaining, but way way over the top.3. The action; plenty of it and nonstop.4. The writing / storyline is the weakest link of this film. This film could be lot better if the story had more complexity / depth to it. furthermore, more character development would have added a lot more to this film.5. All in all, if you're looking for a solid action film that won't require any thinking or significant attention span, this is a good choice."
5,Pure Fun,This is one of the best movies I have watched with John Travolta in it in awhile. The action was off the chain and the comedy was just all out funny. I laughed my butt off. This was a great experience. A must Buy.
4,FROM PARIS WITH FUN,"From Paris With Love is the type of movie that is useless to fault an implausible story, outrageous action and gunplay and just sit back and enjoy the ride.Jonathan Rhys Davies plays the aide to the U.S. ambassador in Paris and a low-level spy who is looking for more action in the field and when he finds himself teamed with John Travolta as a half-crazy, take no prisoners agent, he finds all the action he is looking for and more. At first the movie seems to be about drug trafficking but settles down to a terrorist plot to blow up a peace conference at the U.S. embassy in Paris.The identity of the suicide bomber would be a spoiler but it shows Rhys Davies new-found respect to do the right thing even if it involves personal loss.But overall the picture is one of those funny/action movies and i had a good time, even the in-joke of Travolta calling his Big Mac a royale with cheese. A wink to Quentin Tarentino and Travoltas classic line in Pulp Fiction."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen,"My husband brought this movie home telling me how great it was... It was absolutely AWFUL!!! This was an hour and a half of my time I will never get back (actually less, because I couldn't finish watching it). At one point I was cracking up, not because it was funny, but because it was so ridiculously unbelievable. I ended up reading a book while my husband watched the rest of this trash. I normally like John Travolta, but this movie was just a conglomerate of guns blazing, explosions, and stupid dialogue."
2,Luc Besson gives in to his worse instincts,"Luc Besson is the writer and producer of ""Paris With Love"",but his influence on the director is really apparent.At his best, Besson's films are ravishingly well-shot andedited with humor and kinetic energy.At his worst, his films are boring and repetitive, takingone idea and playing it out tiresomely to build a featurelength film.""La Femme Nikita"" is one of the better ones. ""The FifthElement"" is lots of fun and very imaginative.I found ""the Big Blue"" virtually unwatchable. The Joanof Arc movie was overlong by about an hour and sufferedfrom a bizarre tonality, even with it's dazzling sets andcostumes.Travolta has a few opportunities to be fun to watch, but thefilm is sadistic and gratuitously violent. Travolta's characterkills off about 30 people, both innocent folks and terroristsand doesn't get a scratch.This film owes a lot to John Woo style actioners. The film-makingis competent but the story and script are just dumb."
1,unwatchable garbage,"it's not an action movie, more like a comic book populated by intensely unpleasant characters. I couldn't watch more than about 40 minutes - 20 people were dead for no obvious reason, and the two protagonaists were snorting cocaine. I wish I could get my money back as well as the time I wasted watching this junk."
1,"Oooh, people get killed and stuff blows up! With lots of different weapons!","If that type of movie appeals to you, then here's another one for you. Uninteresting plot. A so-what twist. I liked both of the big name actors and thought they did a good job, but they didn't have much to work with. How many people killed in the first half hour? The increasing pile of bodies was actually used as an attempt at humor in the scene where Rhys Meyers goes up flights of stairs after Travolta. I don't think murder is that funny.If you like to completely turn your mind off and just react to explosions, guns, and blood, then this is the perfect movie for you.If you require even the slightest bit of intelligence in your movies, give this one a miss."
2,Government Propaganda dressed up in a mindless action flick,"Fun action but the story is very dissapointing! Travolta plays a sexist, racist, dirty harry meets steven segal bad to the bone good guy. The viewer never knows why the bad guys do what they do but according to story it does not matter as long as they die, and sometimes nice people can do bad things, but they will kill you if you try to reason with them.Oh and the acting is solid."
4,John boldheaded?,"The movie is good action adventure....don't expect to much more than that.....Travolta makes the movie worth watching...but don't expend more than $5,00 (including shipping)"
5,"Action + Comedy = Kick Ass Squared, MUST WATCH","I thought this was going to be an action movie.Imagine going WOW & laughing at the same time.If you've been working diligently all day, this is the movie to make you exclaim loudly.While some of the props in the movie don't make sense, you'll understand them in due time.I'm going to rewatch this with a friend.ROFLMAO while ... Ouch that hurt?!Could you envision John Travolta vs James Bond?"
3,From Paris With Love - Less action more Hollywood hype.,"The DVD was in the condition advertised. Thank You.The movie was, I think, less spectacular than advertised by Hollywood, but it was an action packed adventure. However, I felt the ending was anticipated and that subtracted from the movie's effectiveness, but again, if you are looking for an action packed adventure this is your movie."
2,Standard Action Movie,"""From Paris With Love"" is a pretty standard action movie: gun fights, fist fights, terrorists, a quick-witted good guy who clearly none of the bad guys should be messing with.But beyond that, ""From Paris With Love"" is nothing special. Nothing about it stands out as anything worth seeing more than once and then not thinking about again. And it didn't help that the ""twist"" is predictable less than twenty minutes into the movie. Nor does it help that it is completely anti-climactic. I won't deny that the action scenes can be fun, but you can see better action scenes in the Bourne Trilogy, and those movies are far superior.Do yourself a favor: if you must see the movie, go to a matinee, or wait to rent it on DVD."
5,From Paris with Love,"Young CIA agent James Reece who has a cushy day job but dreams of an exciting life in the field. When the agency offers him his first big-time assignment, James must team with crazed lone wolf Charlie Wax to stop a terrorist bombing plot. Although James is initially in way over his head, he soon realizes that he needs to trust Charlie if he wants to live his dream and save his own life, because the bad guys not only want to cause damage to the city, but want James killed. This movie is two hours of entertainment. It's John Travolta like you have never seen him before. The story itself is not particularly noteworthy. But there is lots of action as Travolta shows everyone who's boss in this action-packed special effects extravaganza. Also there is non-stop violence with Travolta leading the way. If you like movies with stories that feature non-stop violence, then this movie is for you."
5,Superb Travolta,"Ever since ""Welcome Back Kotter"", I have dismissed John Travolta as a serious actor. This film is perfect with him and he performs in a manner that makes him generic to its impact and entertainment value. From his inate sense of humor brought to a killer instinct in this plot and his general demeanor he is superb and I can't imagine anyone else playing his role. He is perfect in the movie. A gory and violent movie - but that is the movie of our times - but it is so well crafted and done, that it is truely entertaining."
2,Simplistic Shoot Em Up Movie,"From Paris With Love wastes the talents of both John Travolta and Jonathan Rhys Meyers in a buddy spy movie which immediately turns into a shoot em up fest throughout Paris. Travolta is the ""crazy"" spy whereas Meyers is the intellectual one. I was hoping just to find a pleasant evening's entertainment but this was so trite and ridiculous that it couldn't even be that. Don't waste your money."
1,"Really, really bad movie.","Evidently, the writer just gave up on writing something halfway decent. Besides the flaming ethnocentric borderline racism going on in this movie, the whole thing is just bad. Guess what? John Travolta's character ""does it his own way"" and ""gets things done."" Imagine that! Very original. And Jonathan Rhys Meyers's character has the depth of a papercut and is ""by the book."" Are you serious? I know this is a shoot 'em up movie, but come on. Try harder.Don't waste your money. This movie has already been done, and done better."
4,"This Ain't ""From Russia with Love!"" LOL","4 Stars = ClassicHilarious black comedy spoof on the super spy genre. John Travolta is all over the top & tongue & cheek in this witty, funny, parody! He is worth the price of admission alone, & seems like he is having the time of his life! Who wouldn't with a vase full of cocaine! LOL!Good wink to ""Pulp Fiction, ""Royal with Cheese."" LOL!The anti James Bond!"
3,Fair movie,"This is by far NOT John Travolta's typical movies. It is a fair movie. Funny in parts, lots of action, but silly in parts also. I really didnt know what to expect from this movie. I guess a better movie I guess. Its something to watch when you run out of anything else to watch."
4,Forget That Its Travolta,"This movie is fairly good despite the fact that Travolta is in it, he plays a very entertaining character. Problem is Travolta always knows it when he is playing an interesting character. A fair share of Political Incorrectness,and addressing France`s ""Muslim Immigration Issue"" add to the intellectual shock value of this film."
3,movie review,"The slow start of the movie made me worry about the quality of the rest of the film. After introducing the John Travolta character, (thankfully) the movie picked up from there. I really can't see this movie as one that has to be bought. I enjoyed the movie once, and once is enough for me. As a person that rented the movie, I can say that i'm happy with my rental. I REALLY did enjoy some of the stunt driving that was performed in this movie. On a side note, I am a little shocked how much of the story is spoiled by other reviewers."
4,Body Count,"Great sound track for subwoofer! A bit corny at times, but a story line that keeps you in your chair, but how many people can John kill?"
3,John Travolta Gone Wild,"Without John Travolta, From Paris With Love wouldn't be worth watching. Sure he goes way over-the-top here, but unlike the bad guy he played recently in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, he seems to be having a blast this time around. With his bald head and black goatee, his super spy character, Charlie Wax, looked the part and I had no trouble believing he could kill over 50 people and come away with not even a scratch. It also helps that he is given by far the best dialogue and manages to get a few laughs when he isn't raising the bodycount. Jonathan Rhys Meyers didn't impress me much, but I liked some of the banter between him and Travolta. The plot is all over the place and I'm still trying to figure out where everything tied in. The action scenes were average and totally unbelievable, but I knew going in that realism wasn't this film's chief concern. My advice is to wait and rent this one for Travlota alone. He at least makes it a fun mess."
2,"Good action, weak plot","Maybe I've watched one too many spy thrillers, but the twist in this one was clear from the moment ... well I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say someone who plants bugs for a living should know better. It was so obvious that I thought it might be one of those fake twists to throw people off when they think they've got it. Disappointingly, it wasn't.I was able to suspend disbelief for the pleasantly over-the-top action, yet I couldn't stop wondering why this rosy-cheeked assistant was ever considered for ""special ops training"" in the first place. From the beginning, he would just mess things up and get lucky enough to talk his way out of it. He'd make a better politician than clandestine terrorist hunter.As an action flick, the second part of the movie doesn't disappoint. There's a fair amount of creative death and destruction, and a respectable car chase. It just felt like a waste of talent. This would be a good movie to play in the background while doing laundry."
2,2 1/2 stars for an O.K. time killer,"John Travolta returns and hams it up as an American agent sent to Paris to thwart a terrorist plot. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is an aide to the American ambassador and becomes Wax's (Travolta) partner. Murder and mayhem ensue. We have the usual stuff seen in this type of shoot-em-up. Wax kills scores of bad guys within minutes without getting a scratch. But of course when it comes to killing the terrorist bent on blowing up the conference, he can't get it done. Rhys Meyers seems out of his element here. He's terrific in The Tudors however!! Travolta is a hoot I will admit and the stunts and fight sequences are well done in a ""Hong Kong Kung Fu"" style. I think the director did a pretty good job, but the material is nothing new and that doesn't make it worth watching unless you've got nothing to do and want to kill some time and a few brain cells."
2,The Professional It Ain't,"From Le Samourai to The Professional to Unleashed to Taken, French action films are among my favorites. Trendy, jazzy, quirky, stylish and exciting. And seeing Travolta back in action as an eccentric hitman reminds me of better days in his career. Which is why From Paris With Love leaves a particularly bad taste in my mouth. The plot is linear and by the numbers, the protagonist lacking in interesting quirks, Travolta's character is inscrutable and confusing. I was bored and annoyed by this uninspired, often jingoistic mess."
1,Absurd Boring Drivel... ( predictable jingoism with no plot ),"There was no willing suspension of disbelief and I knew what I was getting into being a big fan of movies like the the 007 series and the Bourne Identity films.Why was this movie so bad ? The plot was stupid, the characters played were not believable. Jingoistic tough guy kills thirty gang members with his bare hands, cussing, swearing with a thin story line. Boring and very predictable, shoot em' up , blow it up, stupidity.I love action films that have a level of sophistication and story line. This is clearly not one of them. I couldn't watch this horrid awful movie, it was like really bad television."
2,not insufferable... but not good.,predictable.not fun.boring.couldn't make up it's mind what it was gonna be- a comedy or a an action thriller....
1,hated the Travolta character,"The Travolta character was super obnoxious. It would have been OK if he was so for a reason, like getting people pissed off at him to get something done. But it was pointless. I couldn't bear to watch it after a few minutes with him."
2,Waste of time,"A disappointing film. A few good action scenes but most are canned. Film's tries at humor fall well short. Overall, a poor film."
3,Mindless action film,"Don't get me wrong, I love action films. But the plot is simplistic and I expect more from a Luc Besson film. Check out Leon: The Professional, The Transporter 1 & 2, or Taken, which are all produced by Besson. This movie doesn't have the wry sense of humor of Transporter or the intensity of Taken.Rhys Myers plays a petty embassy official who wants to become a spy. He gets teamed up with Travolta, who is an undercover operative who swears a lot and shoots first and asks questions later.If you want to see a movie that has non-stop action but a better plot, check out out Shoot'em Up or Taken."
4,The Guilty Pleasure of the Year!,"A low ranking agent named James (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) gets stuck with a nutty high ranking agent named Charlie Wax (John Travolta) as his partner. There's nothing too fresh about a stiff getting stuck with a nut as his partner, yet I really liked From Paris with Love.It's trashy and full of plot holes, yet it's a completely fun action thriller with Travolta at his best. Skip Old Dogs, wow he gets to take pills that make him have a goofy smile during a funeral. Here Travolta gets to do what he does best and that's....be cool. While Pulp Fiction fans should enjoy the fact that his character's favorite meal is...a Royale with Cheese."
3,To Travolta with thanks,"I was waiting for this to come to pay channels but it never did. Spike Tv showed it awhile ago but they edited it and messed up on how they programmed it to show so I missed parts. However the movie itself is good, kind of like a badass version of ""get shorty""."
4,Paris Rocks!,"Fabulous, fun, exciting, adrenaline rush with Travolta's charming humor as a nonchalant, relaxed, but utterly capable assassin of invaluable creativity and spontaneity. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays a naive second fiddle, distastefully learning the ropes, barely surviving getting splattered in each unexpected scene. The movie is a roller coaster ride with laughs, oohs, and ahs, and a bit of a twist to find the root of all these murderous encounters. A more polished ""Crank"" type film...i loved it! Lots of humor, innuendo, and the gore was minimilized...more like Wily E. Coyote...a delightful action romp!"
3,Enjoyable,"I will say one thing - it's very different seeing John Travolta with his head shaved. I'd never seen him like this before, and he looks almost like a whole another person.Overall, it's not a bad movie. Personally, I found Travolta's character to be a bit over the top, but there's a good amount of action scenes to make up for it. If you're a fan of action movies and don't take this one TOO seriously, it turns out to be a decently entertaining flick. If the producers of this movie were aiming for an over the top effect, they succeeded. I give it 3.5/5 stars."
5,Great Entertainment,"This was such a fun movie to watch...I am normally not a big Travolta fan, however he did an excellent job at portraying a semi-crazy, yet seasoned spy; definately one of the better roles he has played in all his career as an actor. So much fun to watch that even my 62 year old mother-in-law just loved it...Plenty of laughs, action and entertaining just watching her enjoy a movie so much. We watched it on Blu-Ray so of course the picture and sound were just fabulous!The movie has plenty of twists and turns and almost non-stop action. If you're looking for a fun, fast paced, action packed movie with a lot of surprises, this is a great one to see."
5,Suspense All the Way to the End,"This is one of Travolta's best in quite some time. He plays his character to the hilt and then some! And the ending of the movie--you are in for quite a surprise!! If you are a long-time Travolta fan, you'll love seeing him at his best again; and if you aren't a long-time fan, this movie might convert you."
5,This is the most revolutionary book about morals.,John Dewey's HUMAN NATURE AND CONDUCT is a book that has the potential to change the world for better. This book establishes the guidelines for social psychology and helps people solve their problems and get rid of their hangups. It is a must read for anyone and everyone who needs to find meaning in life.
1,Typical wrong-headed Altman effort...,"Like most, or maybe all, of Robert Altman's films this one tries hard for casual hipness that with time really defines Hollywood Square. This movie seems so hermetically sealed up in coy attitudes & kool moods & stylish settings while flaunting Altman's usual nasty misogyny (this time a coke bottle smashed in a woman's face - nice touch), it's an embarrassment."
1,Don't bother with this film,"The only real crime surrounding this film was the murder of Chandler's story. This is just another example of someone capitalizing on someone else's reputation to sell a film. Gould is about as much Marlowe as Pee Wee Herman is Mike Hammer - i.e., there is no resemblence.Additionally, the cinematography is terrible - it looks like a cheap 70's movie shot in video instead of film. There's absolutely no suspense, nor snappy delivery of lines by Gould. I can only imagine that anyone who liked this movie probably cared more about Marlowe's bare-topped neighbors than anything else, because there's almost nothing of redeeming value in this movie.For those fans of real noir and/or hard-boiled detective pulp, don't waste your money or time watching this junk. You'll be disappointed."
3,Altman Missed the Boat by a mile,"I share Leonard Maltin's view that Altman's version of The Long Goodbye was largely disrespectful of Raymond Chandler. If you want to see a fairly offbeat, and mildly interesting film, it's worth checking out. If however you're expecting it to resonate at all with the book, you'll be underwhelmed. The opening cat scene is a dead giveaway that the director is out of touch with the story. Gould could have pulled off the Marlowe character, if there wasn't so much method acting, mumbling 70's, anti hero angst to his character. The fault lies at hands of Altman not Gould. The casting of Sterling Hayden was masterful, as was the cinematography, and the clever use of the theme song. I am hoping one of these days, we actually can see a true film version of ""The Long Goodbye""."
1,Minus 100,"Sorry, this movie just didn't work. Tried to watch it twice, and just couldn't get through the whole thing. Was it supposed to be a thriller? A murder mystery? A comedy? A drama? What?Don't waste your time. If there are any other Philip Marlowe films out there, try them instead. Nothing could be as bad and weak as this film. The only thing I liked about it was the cat (which I am not sure was ever fed!!)."
2,poor quality VHS,"The movie is really good. Elliott Gould is sweet. It looked great when I saw it in theaters way back then. However, whoever was responsible for the transfer from theater format to VHS must have proceeded without the blessings of Altman or the Director of Photography. The original cinematographic composition is gone and replaced with random framing. Hopefully someone will take notice and do the job properly with letterbox."
5,Elliott Gould is the Greatest of all Marlowes!,"An updated tale of Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled hero adrift in Robert Altman's floaty, loose Los Angeles. Marlowe investigates his friend Terry Lennox's supposed suicide, and the private eye finds himself menaced by a terrifying gangster and embroiled in the bizarre events at the home of a Hemingwayesque writer and his ice-queen (remember this is an Altman film!) wife.The cinematography, the story line, the quality of the acting, and above all the brilliant direction make this to be a haunting, unforgettable and totally fascinating film. You'll love it! I saw this movie 28 years ago, and it just gets better with time.And Elliott Gould is awesome!"
2,Overdone -,"Elliott Gould plays a chain-smoking wise-cracking private eye - the former is repulsive and the latter makes no sense whatsoever as it alienates him from the police and others. Somehow he's considered a local mob's best lead for getting their money back from a now 'dead' courier that Gould had driven to the border. At the end, it turns out the courier is still alive, and Gould takes care of that - for reasons that again, aren't very obvious or credible."
2,A disappointment,"I've read Raymond Chandler's ""The Long Goodbye"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. What makes Philip Marlowe such an appealing character is that underneath his cynical exterior is a man who is a romantic. He's a nice man caught up in a sleazy, amoral world.Unfortunately, Robert Altman completely misses the point of Marlowe's character in this film. While I can respect wanting to take a new approach to a well-worn genre, Altman's sneering contempt for Chandler's detective ruins what could have been a truly great movie. Elliott Gould too often comes across as a goofy smart-... who seems to think he is too cool for the role he is playing.Unlike the genre-busting ""M*A*S*H"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"", Altman completely strips the characters in this film of any humanity. There is not one character in this film that is even remotely likeable."
2,Elliot Gould isn't GOOD.,"This film, plays ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER as a body builder in the locker room. His role is small. Even so, I found this film boring. THE LONG GOODBYE (1973) Rated: R 1 1/2 stars out of 5."
5,An underappreciated Altman movie,"Certainly one of the best movies of the last 30 years, but unfortunately not appreciated as such.Do not judge the movie on your first viewing. It operates on a number of levels and the wonderful interplay of characters and plot gets richer each time the movie is seen.The bit with Gould trying to substitute an ""off"" brand of food for his cat is wonderful. Mr. Gould has had more bad roles than good ones in his career, but this must be his high point.Jim Bouton, of NY Yankee and ""Ball Four"" fame, does a very credible job in what I think was his first (and last) stint as an actor. And as wooden as she is, it is fun to watch Nina Van Pallandt.You'll thank me for turning you on to this movie."
4,Oh Great! I'm Gonna Have That Song In My Head All Day!,"Robert Altman is notorious for having plenty of movement in all his films. This one is no exception. The transplantation to the 70's seems weird, but it's the story that really sets it apart. Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe is played with such awkwardness by Gould. I loved his chain smoking, anywhere he can get the chance. Sterling Hayden should have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance. I also got a kick out of seeing Arnold ""The Terminator"" Schwarzenegger in a non-speaking role."
4,A Unique Goodbye,I was late to discover this gem of a movie. I only learned about it a couple of years ago. I am a Philip Marlowe appreciator and have searched out quite a few of the various versions and actors who have played this facinating character. Gould's is one of the most unique versions in this Altman take on Raymond Chandler. Altman brings the best out of this plot of human frailties and shares a glimpse into 70's California using the sleepy eyes of the Rip Van Winkle like Marlowe of Elliot Gould. This is both classic Robert Altman and Philip Marlowe. I highly reccommend it.
3,70s Altman favorite,"I, like every other self-respecting film buff, am a huge fan of Altman's films of the 1970s. This is not one of my favorites from that time period, although ""good"" Altman = ""great"" any other director. Update of Marlowe tale has Elliot (miscast) as private eye.The film has a lot going for it, gorgeous cinematography, Gould isn't very good as Marlowe (he's too jokey), but a lot of the supporting roles are great (particular Sterling Hayden).Regarding Altman's other films from the 70s, here go my votes:McCabe and Mrs. Miller (4 stars) Altman's best ever. UnparalleledNashville (2 stars, don't shoot me film buffs!) Muddled and draggy though I love Carradine's songThieves Like Us (3 stars) Not as good as McCabe (not sturdy enough) but still great.MASH (4 stars) A classic! Love it or leave!California Split (4 stars) Best poker film ever. Great attention to detailim out"
3,Only Altman Could Have Made This Movie,"""The Long Goodbye"" is director Robert Altman's take on the hardboiled crime fiction of Raymond Chandler and his most accomplished screenwriter, Leigh Brackett. It was an odd film when first released, the conceit being Philip Marlowe's taking a big sleep in the 1940s, only to awaken in Southern California in the 1970s. It's now an even odder film, since the 70s are long gone and make for a certain kind of period picture. But if you're willing to be carried along by Altman and his merry band of players, led by Elliott Gould, you'll probably enjoy the ride."
2,"Script stinks, kinda bad acting","It's amazing how much lower acting standards seemed to be in 1973 when this was made. You can practically see Elliot Gould reading his lines throughout this Altman flick. Same with many of the others. Arnold Schwarzenneger is a hoot as a musclebound bodyguard, though, but has no lines. Gould chain smokes throughout, everywhere he goes. The 70s LA sets are interesting for their period decor. I wondered where Marlow lived because his building is quite scenic, though the naked yoga girls next door are simply annoying. The title track plays throughout the movie, but there doesn't seem to be much of a score, otherwise. At two hours, this was typical of its day. But it seems too long by at least 30 minutes now."
4,"For a brief, shining moment in the '70s, Gould was king","Director Robert Altman can find a sublimely goofy sort of humor in almost any setting, and he does so here. For one thing, the musical score primarily consists of a single tune played over and over by different performers in different arrangements.What's amazing is how well this self-conscious jokiness fits with the bleak motivations of the flick's traditionally noir characters.Gould's Everyman-ish anti-Marlowe is one you'd actually like to hang out with. He's just as good with cats as with comebacks, for instance.If you've ever wondered how someone like Elliott Gould could be the top box-office draw in America for a short period in the 1970s, you should give ""The Long Goodbye"" a look. For a brief, shining moment, the man was king.As Marlowe says, ""It's OK with me."""
3,"For what it is, a good product.","With the understanding that this is not supposed to be a top-of-the-line photo printer, nor is it intended for high volume use - does the job and does it quite well. I use mine to print greeting cards and promotional bookmarks. Its supplies are too expensive, and are used up too quickly, for me to print flyers and brochures. But it will handle 110-pound card stock that makes my laser printer jam, its output is vivid and fairly accurate (although skin tones can come out looking weird on occasion), and it's easy to change the cartridges.Not a bad little printer if you just want to print a few greeting cards or documents in color, a few times a week."
1,This model is no good!,I have also had lexmark and never had any problems before until I bought this model. It would NOT print and made a grinding noise. So I returned that model and got another one (I thought any thing can happen in shipping). This model did the same thing. I even called tech support and they said there was something wrong with the second one. I do NOT recommend this model to anyone.
3,"Not bad, but rather slow","I have had my printer for awhile now. It isn't the worst printer in the world, although it does print slow. Gives me more headaches than anything. I don't have the problems of paper jams and bad ink splots, but it does seem to use a lot of ink. All in all it isn't bad for the price, however I am considering buying a different model. Then maybe I can get my work printed faster!!"
1,Big Printer Driver (Softward) Problems,"I am unable to use my Lexmark printer because the driver software is apparently incompatible with my operating system, Windows XP. No help was forthcoming form customer support. I have updated the driver and associated software from the Lexmark website but the driver still crashes. I would stay away from Lexmark."
4,Good value printer,"It might not be the speediest nor have the best output, but at the price, how could I resist? I've been very pleased so far."
3,The Good and the Bad,"I have really enjoyed the quality of this printer since I upgraded my motherboard and added Windows XP. I have had no problems with it and my digital images have been just awesome.On the flip side this printer is a nightmare with Windows 98 SE. I experienced all the problems reported from other gripers...paper jams, driver errors, misfeeds, multi-page feeds, crooked pages, etc. I used to have to reboot my system to reactivate my printer. It was very frustrating. It cleared up immediately with my PC change. It was like night and day. Even print speed improved.I think the biggest issue with this printer is OS compatibility. I also think that anyone who does digital imaging will be rapidly going through ink. I haven't found a printer yet that doesn't drain the ink resources when making photo prints."
1,A Giant Misstep,"I thought that after ""winning"" a Z-32 in a raffle, I was making an upgrade over the Lexmark Z-11 I currently ownded. It was not long after I found a good home for my Z-11 that I found out I was mistaken.Everything that could go wrong with this printer did go wrong. I had uneven page pulls (yielding crooked copys), paper jams, claims of paper jams when no such thing occured, ""problems communicating with the printer"", issues with the ink cartridges, print jobs that occassionally crashed my computer, etc.The final straw came when the printer cartridges could not be found anywhere in stores. I broke down and bought a new (Lexmark)printer.My adivce is, if you want a cheap, reliable, versatile, quality printer, buy a Lexmark printer BUT, do not, I REPEAT, do not buy THIS Lexmark printer."
1,Probably for older people,This model is not a good fit for younger men. It does not have filts..looks very flat.I did not like this pant. I bought it for $15 thinking that it was cheap ( for Microfiber ).
1,Anyone can lie to anyone,"So men are the biggest liars? sorry but not true.I believe this writer has an axe to grind probably from a relationship that didn't work out.Some writers write for themselves and not for others.I know a lesbian,and guess what? Women have LIED to her!Glory BE! a woman telling a tall tale! nah,,,YES!A lie can take place in any relationship wether straight or gay,any relationship.Don't waste your money on this hateful male bashing book!"
1,Sexist Piffle!,These are lies both sexes tell one another. To makes these lies just a male thing is the height of sexism. What a man-hater the author is.
4,"Good book for men, too!","In the first pages of the book the author lists the 101 lies she discovered. As a man who earnestly tries to be both open and honest, I was surprised by the number of ""lies"" I'd been party to. This became a good starting point for a frank discussion between my wife and me."
4,insightful,"I cannot believe some of these lies that men have admitted to. I could hardly put this book down. Learn how to spot a liar and get the truth out of him! What woman hasn't been lied to? Yes, Dory seems a bit wary of the opposite sex, but a lot of women are after being lied to so often. Protect your heart and learn when you're being lied to."
1,Not insighful - out to make quick buck,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote that she ""hates men."" It's interesting that her other book is about career consulting....and this one comes on the tail of all the Mars vs. Venus and Dr. Laura material. Anyone else think she is simply jumping on the bandwagon and trying to make a quick buck in an area she knows little more about than an average joe?"
1,Post-breakup Dumpee Salve,"Why do men lie? For a variety of reasons, same as women. Why do men lie in relationships? Same again, and men have not cornered the market on self-serving lies. Women often just fool themselves into believing they lie for ""good"" reasons. The author misses not only that point, but the point that men often lie to avoid the social confrontation involved in telling an overly nosey woman ""it's none of your d***ed business!"" when they won't take no information as an answer."
3,My humble opinion of this particular book..,"Yes, some men lie to deceive would be lovers and wives, but not ALL men. This book seems to give people the ""stereotypical"" impression that all men lie, and even goes a step further to say that women believe all these lies. Sorry, there are exceptions to every rule, and not only are there MANY exceptions to this rule, the rule is pretty close to bent out of shape. This is a good book for those women who are easily deceived by the charms of men. In that respect it is very helpful to avoid a lot of stress and would be heartache."
1,Beware of the 101 Lies This Author Will Tell You,"The author takes on a daunting subject and some of her observations are interesting, yet her scholarship leaves a lot to be desired. For example, she states that, on average, women wait six months becoming sexually intimate with a partner. This and other assertions left me wondering just how much of her book was based on fact and real case studies. On the whole, I was worried about the 101 lies the author was telling me."
1,lies,"101 Lies Men Tell.....hmmm, interesting concept. Do you think it would have been published if it was titled 101 Lies Jews Tell...or Blacks or Natives? I didn't think so either. I read this book and it appears the lies are, for the most part, gender neutral. There really isn't a lot of material that most anyone over the age of 25 wouldn't already know. Here's a ""guidline"": If you believe you are being lied to, you probably are. If you purchase a book with a title that suggests a specific group of people are the cause for your woes....well, it's probably going to take more than reading to clean up that part of your life."
3,"good piano cto., poor trio playing","I like Veronica Jochum's work here in these exceptionally attractive and unduly neglected works. However, Silverstein's excessive vibrato in the trio is a real irritant. Buy the disc for the concerto, but if it's the trio you are intersted in seek out the vastly preferable Beaux Arts recording on Philips (or Itunes!)"
4,Easy listening Jazz for the Holidays,"If you are looking for a quiet evening, with a hot cup of tea, while watching the snow fall, and waiting for Christmas, this is one of those really good listening CDs to set the mood. It is truly a surprise. Though track 8 does seem a little too ""cowboy bar-ish"", this CD will provide a good time for your ears."
1,Good music but not enough cowbell,"I've got an itch, and nothing is going to scratch it but more cowbell. Too much piano, not enough cowbell!!!"
1,Listen for yourself.,"The author of this book claims to know everything about each song Fleetwood Mac has ever made and frankly, as an avid FM fan, I think this author really knows nothing. The author explains the feel of each song in a very pessimistic and sometimes sarcastic way, and he often fails to notice important nuances that Fleetwood Mac is famous for, and when he does notice them, he shoots them down as being overproduced or unecessary. As someone who has listened to pretty much everything this incredible band has recorded, I would advise those curious about FM's music to listen to it for themselves and create an informed opinion. Skip this garbage all together."
1,don't waste your money on blue synthetic pads,"These pads are total crap. They might be a little less messy but they do NOT cool the air properly because they don't get fully saturated nor retain their moisture. The water mostly flows completely over the top of the pad and down into the reservoir without soaking into the pad. The aspen pads are consistently about 7-10 degrees cooler than these blue pieces of garbage. Don't listen to the ""reviewer"" who gave this product 5 stars but hadn't even used it yet!"
4,Filter Case in Review,I am pleased with the purchase my Tamrac filter case. It allows me to carry three filters with me in safety and easy access. The case easily attaches to my strap or camera bag.
2,Too small for Large Filters,"The Tamrac S.A.S. Compact Filter Case is well constructed, rugged, and will hold filters securely. That said, I found two problems, on minor, one major, with the design:Minor: the pockets don't expand in true ""accordion"" fashion due to how they're sewn to the back. The result is the front pocket is smaller than the back.Major: No photographer in their right mind would entrust their filters (as shown in the product image above) to a case where anything would touch, contaminate, and possible permanently damage them. That's why all quality filters come with some type of hard container for storage. The size of the container drastically reduces the size of the filter the MX-S5363 can hold. A practical maximum limit may be as small as 50mm."
2,Too tight,The pouches are too tight. it takes a bit of an effort to take it out and put it back in for 67mm filter
2,Tight,"Ok, I guess if I did read the whole review it would have said only holds THREE filters..... I would have passed...... also I dont think I would put a 15.00 filter in one of these slots..... Your better off just keeping them in the plastic......Im using my for a battery holder..... p.s. the outside is made very well...."
4,Does the job well,It keeps the filters clean and well protected. The clip on the front is superfluous. The velcro closure is all I use.
3,I like most of the design,"Just wasn't too happy with the interior material. It's not sandpaper rough or anything, but it is definitely a bit disconcerting to put a $100 filter in between this material. I have some tiny microfiber cloths that I wrapped around my more expensive ones, but then that kinds of defeats the point of a quick access device like this.You can fit two filters in the back pocket if you screw them together.I wasn't too impressed with how it connects to my Tamrac strap. It's designed to do this, but the hook on the strap is tiny, and the hook on the case is huge, so it just flops around wherever it feels like. Wish it was more secure.Guess companies think nobody is using filters anymore so they don't put a lot of time into making these better?"
1,Risk of scratches even to pro-grade B+W filters,"I just got this item, put my B+W MRC filters in it. took them out after a few hours, and there were markings all over the circular polarizing filter. They were NOT there before, since the filters are also brand new. The fabric inside this item is not soft enough and I fear it might damage my filters, so I will be returning this item back."
3,A little too big,"Takes in 3 filters in 3 slots, but overall the pouch is a little too big (top part). Had to readjust my SLR backpack organizer in order to hold this pouch now. Padding is fine, the filters will be safe. Would be happier if I found something that is matchbox shaped with slots to hold the filters."
1,Marks up my 77mm filters,This pouch has a hard surface inside and out. It tends to leave marks on my filters that can only be removed with a wet cleaning cloth. Cannot recommend. BAD
2,Carefull with the plastic,These toys are made as cheaply as possible.This is one of the worst as far as durable goes.Be careful taking it out of the box those little guns break easily.It's nice for display but not for a kid or anyone to handle roughly.
4,Understanding Italo Calvino,This is an excellent addition to the already large body of work about the author.
4,"Its clear that Grant needs to do more Did I Save jazz, rock,","Its obvious that Grant needs to do more Did I Save Jazz,Blues and Rock. What a way out sound!!!!!!"
4,Great new jazz for the times.,"The samples show the light aire of todays jazz. It is what is missing from most, but not all of the performers who have almost reached the household names, and the club acknowledged."
4,Indispensable for automated traders,"The subjects treated in this book are essential to understanding the process of data mining, and if the results of the data mining have any significance.The book covers a lot of ground, not all of it strictly necessary (for example, theories on market randomness and the philosophy of science), but the core material is indispensable."
2,Waste of time,"A lot of blabla about a minor testing of limited rules and then generalizing the results. Another example of a savantasse trying to impress others with ""scientifical evidence"" that is in fact no evidence at all. The man took clearly some shortcuts to state his case. He failed completely.However there are some usefull parts and if you're a statistics freak you might like it. But it does not add in any positive way to gain useable knowledge about technical analysis.Conclusion: not worth the money at all, relevant useable information minimal, too much text for such a minor and irrelevant research."
1,Useless,"I found this book useless..a total waste of time and money.Instead of analyzing the results obtained by using the various technical indicators,the author simply trashes their use,and does so in a preverse use of mathematical formulas,from which the reader gains nothing.I truly felt like my money was taken,for the purchase of the book,under false pretenses."
1,Do not waste your time and money!,WHAT A RIP OFF. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS THE ART OR SCIENCE OF FINDING SOMETHING TRENDING TO PROFIT FROM PRICE MOVEMENT. ARONSON REMOVES TRENDING PRICE BEHAVIOR. I WAS VERY SUPPRISED TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM WILEY. MAYBE THE DUDE DOESN'T GET YOU FIND AND FOLLOW THE TREND NOT PREDICT IT. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS IS MY OPINION. GET A REAL CLASSIC LIKE TECHNICAL TRADING FOR DUMMIES!
5,Brilliant and eye-opening book.,"The first 150 pages or so are the best introduction to cognitive psychology and the scientific method I have seen, and can be read for that alone. It details the cognitive limitations inherent in the mind's workings and how they cause us to generate and maintain false beliefs. These false beiefs could be about trading and finance or any other topic, including astrology and alien abductions. Aronson then explains the way the scientific method and statistcal inference can be used to generarate actual knowledge about trading systems.With this as a basis, he uses the methods of science to weed technical analysis of the subjective (i.e., untestable) propositions, and clearly explains what is needed to test a trading scheme to see if it is really predictive.Highly recomended."
3,Kinda good,"Aronson had some really good thoughts in this really long book.#1 If you're weak on backtesting methods, this will give you help understanding the statistical testing necessary in order to prove your method worthwhile or not.#2 This book will help you to define what is a true, objective, scientific based technical analysis of the financial markets from a loose, subjective imaginative based technical analysis of the same.Good, but lengthy."
1,I got a refund.,"I bought this book hoping it would give me some good trading ideas. I do not know why this has some good reviews. I do not know why the author spent any time writing this book either. There is nothing useful here. This book is an extremely long winded way of saying, 'you need to test your trading ideas to see if they are really any good'. To me, the author proved that one can do amazing statistical acrobatics with market data and still not have any idea how to make money in the market. If you wish to do some serious number crunching and still be clueless about the markets, then I recommend this book."
5,A must-have for TA practitioners,This book shakes some of your most deep beliefs in TA - and this is a healthy thing. Read it with an open mind.
1,There is better books available,"This book doesn't test 6400 binary rules,unless you see a Price/Moving average cross with a period of 1 to 200 as 200 rules. I see it as 1 rule with 1 optimizing parameter. A lot of stuff get repeated and the book shouldn't be longer than 200 pages. There is a lot to learn if you are a novice trader and if you've never tried to develop a trading system. I think this book isn't worth half the selling price. Rather buy ""The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies (Hardcover)"" by Jeffrey Owen Katz. You will learn something about GA and NN. Don't waste your time on this book. I'm selling mine."
4,interesting,Fiction spook-stories set around real 'haunted' places!!!So cool!I have only read one of the stories in this book and it is fabulous!
1,Torin Jack 3.5 ton,"Useless foot pedal. Very dangerous lowering arm. When one tries to lower the vehicle, it drops like a ton of bricks, there is no slow to it I have tried over and over but it goes from 0 to 50 in no time flat. I returned to the store. This was my second torin Jack, I guess I never learn. I realized it was bad design when I used my friend's 3 ton jack and it lowered so slow that it was hard to tell it was lowering. I do not recommed buying this jack unless you are looking to sue the company because eventually you will."
1,ALL JACKED UP,I bought this jack because my craftsman jack would lower on its own. this one does the same thing. all i did was replace one problem with another.
5,SUBCONSCIOUS HEALING,"I DOES NOT COME AS A SURPRISE TO FIND MYSELF WONDERING ABOUT THE HIGH EFFECTIVITY THAT LIES IN GREGORIANI CANTUS TO HEAL AND TRANSFORM OUR INNER VOID. THERE AWAKENS A LONGING TO JOIN THE RITHMIC WAVE OF CONTEMPLATING VOICES, ALMOST AS IF NOTHING MATTERS, BUT TO EMIT ONE'S SPIRIT TO GOD. IF YOU'VE EVER FELT A SIMILAR ATTRACTION, THEN GREGORIANI CANTUS WILL PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR THIS LEAP OF FAITH. GIVING IT A FIVE STAR RATING IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHERE GREGORIANI CANTUS REALLY BELONGS."
5,pleasant surprise,"""sex, lies and handwriting"" is an intriguing read. Michelle builds cases for the whodunnits in well known cases. Her writing style is for the more experienced graphologists as well as for the beginner. If you don't believe one can read character from your handwriting, this book will certainly make you think otherwise. An excellent read, an excellent gift!"
2,review,"I was looking for a handwriting analysis book. I owned one in the early to mid 80s. I am searching for the one I originally had. My daughter bought this book for me. It's more about famous personalities, not how to actually analyze handwriting. It was disappointing in that aspect. I thank my daughter for trying, but this book does not cover the point by point detail I was hoping for. This book is good for reading....not so much for handwriting analysis."
3,"Sex, Lies and Handwriting review","This book is well written and provides quick and informative insight for the newcomer to graphology. As such it is more of a general interest book and provides the basis for some fun analyses. While there are a few new useful and interesting interpretive quirks in presented handwriting as highlighted by the author, I had hoped for more comprehensive methodology and input to facilitate more detailed and thorough analyses in the workplace. That would however, possibly detract from the easy to read fun aspect which the author achieves well. Considering her credentials and the fact that useful personal information is 'out there' constantly for our interpretation and use, there is definitely potential for a more comprehensive second edition for the real graphologists to use as a working manual."
5,The best in country shares her expertise and experiences,"Michelle is limitless in her knowledge, she is a natural. How fortunatefor the rest of us to read this extremely interesting and revealing book.She covers the part of handwriting analysis that many teachers won't reveal to students, and these are the most important topics we need to know. This book covers what we would learn in a year of instruction in the classroom. I studied Graphology 15 years ago and dropped out of my classes to pursue my 60 hour a week Custom Residential Building company. How lucky am I to find her book, I am re-inpired! I have now retired from my building company, and I am focusing on Graphology once again, this time with no distractions. I am reading this book for the second time. It's just to valuable, I want to absorb it all."
3,"Sex, Lies and Handwriting","This book was an easy read, yet very interesting. The author does not explain how to analyze handwriting, at least not in depth. For me, the most fascinating part of the book was the author's analysis of two criminal cases: Jack The Ripper and Jon Bennett Ramsey. I was convinced that she solved who Jack the Ripper was, and confirmed my suspicions that Jon Bennett Ramsey's mother, Patty, had something to do with the child's murder. The author also discusses other notorious people such as Ted Bundy, Son of Sam and Charles Manson, to name a few. A good book to read as you sit at the beach or poolside."
4,Such a Tease,"I loved it. This book is riveting and will have you turning pages filled with so much information that makes sense. I enjoyed reading each chapter, looking over the examples she provides in the book. It all makes perfect sense. What did you think of the Jon Benet Ramsey kidnap note? Facinating. I was convinced as I read the analysis and saw each example and it matched the mom. It reminded me so much of what Dayle Hinman (an FBI criminal profiler) says when she is forming a profile of the criminal though Dayle Hinman doesn't use handwriting as a tool. The only downfall was that I wanted information and it wasn't there. This book doesn't teach you handwriting anaylsis, it merely introduces you to it. I'm intrigued. I want more. Very entertaining. Facinating. Riveting. You won't be bored."
3,So-so hair dye,"I like the texture, smell, and color of this dye but it barely lasts for 2-3 days :/ Won't buy again"
5,Good condition,"Have used it a couple of times and the DVD seems to be in good condition! No scratches or apparent flaws. The product itself is a good video for working out. So far, I have only used Winsor pilates and have really enjoyed them."
5,Awesome Fat Burning Workout,"I got the DVD for the ring workout, but the Accelerated Fat Burning is my favorite awesome workout. They have the flamenco music that make the workout fun and easy, and Mary Winsor is so good and inspiring to follow the sound of the music. Great buy because I got it in sale, and the seller was fast and sold a good quality product. Thank you so much."
3,At least something,"I am a very big fan of boleros in general, and especially 50's and 60's boleros. Even though I am young, I can apreciate these things. Luis Miguel is a good artist. His voice is very nice, and he has a master of the music in Armando Manzanero, THE GREATEST SONGWRITER in the history of the bolero. As a Puertorican, I grew up with my grandparents music. Even so, his music is excellent. However, the best interpreters of all this music are the following artists and groups, which LM has managed to copy in some ways, Trio Los Panchos, Los Tres Ases, Los Tres Diamantes, Los Tres Reyes, Felipe Pirela, Bobby Capo, Jose Luis Monero,Vicentico Valdes, Carlos Gardel and the master, Lucho Gatica. Those are the real singers. LM is important, not for the quality of his music, slthough it is very good, but for the more important job of spreading this music. All in all, however, he is definetly NOT the greatest artist alive, much less the best of all time."
5,Una gran coleccion de boleros,"Compre esta coleccion porque conocia algunas de las canciones, y debo decir que por el precio, ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho recientemente. El bolero ha sido un genero muy popular en las generaciones de mis abuelos y mis padres, y sus melodias son tan vigentes hoy en dia como lo fueron muchos anos atras. Luis Miguel interpreta estas inmortales canciones con un estilo unico y glamoroso. En resumen, estoy muy satisfecha con esta adquisicion."
1,garbage!,"He takes beautiful songs that have already been done,and makes them sound like plastic,cheap,wannabe,immitation.I'm trying to figure out what it is that makes him so popular!If you like real romantic music in spanish,try los panchos(whom he attempts to cover)or los dandys.Oh well,music is a personal thing,and I've tryed getting my wife to stop listening to this,but I have been unsuccesful...so there is something to the lads credit!"
1,What?,"It was said that this was a library book in good condition. The book was delivered in a timely manner, but the the condition of the book was very poor. None of the pages were glued to the cover of the book so they all fell out. A few of the pages were ripped from the center seams out as well. I will not order another book from them."
1,"Bad welds, spend a little more to protect your life.",Very bad and incomplete welds. Some of the welds are blotched. I ordered two sets and had to return them because I did not want to risk the car falling on me.I also have some pictures attached for you to see.
1,Bad welds,"Ended up buying the hein-warner 3 ton jack and looked at them side by side. These are only the size of 2 ton jacks and upon inspecting the welds, they didn't even seal the seam properly on one of the two. Did not trust life under a car with these so returned them. $50 bucks more when safety is concerned is well worth not having a crushed ribcage."
5,A must have for safety,"After reading about a recent death by a car enthusiast working on his car using non-locking jack stands, I immediately decided to replace my non-locking jackstands with these locking jack stands. Non-locking jackstands can collapse if the adjustment arm is accidentally bumped and pose a hazard if you're under the vehicle.These jack stands are high quality and lock so they can't collapse accidentally when you're under the vehicle. If your jack stands don't lock you really should consider replacing them."
3,Not the greatest for the price,"They work but there are some issues with them. I have a pair craftsman 3 ton jack stands that are superior in quality, the welds on these jack stands are porous and poorly done compared to the craftsman stands which I own and paid the same price for. I bought these because of the ""double locking"" mechanism and Although the craftsman stands do not have this feature I feel much more confident working under the craftsman stands than these. Additionally, the pin mechanism in one of my jacks does not insert the entire way unless you mess with the arm and upon inspection when you get the pin in the hole the jack stand arm rests on the pin instead of the locking arm on the jack because of the poor precision of the cut out holes for the pin. I would return them but they work without the pin mechanism on cars and my craftsman jacks are high lift for my truck and do not work on cars."
5,Great Jack Stands,For any of you that were wondering it is sold as a pair of jack stands not just one because i was very confused before i purchased these and just waited to see if it was one or two! Besides that they are very sturdy jack stands and i love the double locking feature for added security and no need to bend a piece of steel like i have read with some other comparable Jack stands! I have a 4200 pound dodge charger and these held up the rear of the car just fine! I would reccommend if you have a suv or a car that is higher off the ground than most sedans to buy other jack stands because i believe on the box the maximum lift height is 16 and a quarter inches! However even on the lowest setting it was still able to hold the rear of my charger a little off the ground!
3,Almost decent,"I recently received a set of these, and agree with the reviews about spotty welds.One was actually quite good, complete welds, melted nicely into the steel.However the other stand has a sketchy weld, it looks like a bead of wire just on top of the metal."
4,Fine Jack Stands (Double Locking Gets Stuck Sometimes),They are OK jack stands nothing special. The only problems are that the double locking stick thing sometimes is not aligned properly and does not go in correctly. Also the legs are not flat when they wrap which could result in them sinking into your driveway or garage but that is not a problem for me because I primarily use them for a go kart and ATV but I have heard that it is good to get the ones with the flat legs because of those problems.
4,Decent Stands for Twenty Bucks,"Got my jack stands today, despite warnings about bad welds and poor quality. I think they're pretty nice. No, the welds aren't perfect, but more than adequate for the task. They will likely hold after the sheet steel of the stands buckles under too much weight. I don't know that I'd crawl under a 5 ton truck held up by these stands, but one end of a car is not going to make these stands fail.Until today, all I had on hand was a floor jack, and I was quite uncomfortable under my Mini when I had to put more than my hands underneath.These will certainly alleviate any fear I had crawling under the car to work on it.The stands have a common assembly for holding the stands at different heights, and the added safety of a pin to lock them in place. Well worth the $20 sale price, or even the $25 regular price.Quite satisfied with this purchase."
4,great jacks if you know how to use them,"As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price."
1,"BAD WELDED ,DONT BUY IT DANGER","BAD PRODUCT, WRONG WELDED, ITS ONLY WELD INSIDE, BUT NOT OUT SIDE,SO IS NOT RECOMENDED TO USE IT UNDER CAR. PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE, IS NOT WELD RIGHT.THIS ITEM HAVE TO BE WELD IN BOTH SIDE, INSIDE AND OUT SITE, NOT ONLY INSIDE.THE PIN OR SECOND SAFETY PIN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL, IT MOVE AND DOES NOT HOLD THE POST RIGHT, ITS LIKE NOTHING, SO DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT.--- TORIN WANTS TO SEND IT BACK EVERY YEAR FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION,BUT THEY DONT PAY FOR S/H. THIS SHOUL BE 1 TON, NOT 3 TON WITH THIS WELD FORM.MY ITEM LOOK USED NOT NEW, LOOK'S LIKE SOME ONE USE IT AND RETURNED AND THEN, THEY SENT THEM TO ME. THE UPS DROP IT TO THE FLOOR, CAUSE I HAVE A GATE, SO BE AWARE OF UPS, THEY DONT CARE IF THEY BRAKE IT."
5,Every do it yourselfer needs these,"I have a set of these 3 ton, and also the 2 ton jack stands, both seem well made and are holding up nicely."
1,Returned them.,"I was leery of purchasing these as there were no dimensions listed. I already had a pair of 2 ton jacks; was looking for bigger 3 tons for my full size pickup. They arrived on time but upon inspection they were the exact same size as my 2 tons (height, width, craftsmanship). The only difference was the insert lug. It was about 1/8"" thicker. I guess that's were the increased capacity comes from. But again, being same size and limitations as my 2 tons...they didn't meet my needs."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"These work perfectly! They are exactly what was stated in the description. Make sure to tip the UPS driver, these were very heavy!"
5,Hasn't killed me...yet.,Hold my car up when I need it and does it without a problem. The added safety is always a plus. The finish is nice as well.Would buy again!
3,Pros and Cons,"Im giving it three stars because:Pros: it has a double locking system, unlike other jack stand that say that they do, and don't, it obviously has a double locking system as you can see.Cons: it is smaller and thinner than other 3 ton jack stands.It does not match the height of jack stands that I already own."
2,meh...,"this is probably the worst vol of the russian animation series. none of the animations are particularly interesting, yes even the slightly overrated tale of tales. overall just not that good, if you are getting into this kind of animation id recommend vol. 1 or 2."
2,Superfly nerd!,"Who's this guy trying to fool? What's with the whole superfly funk act? I have listened to this album front to back, there are maybe two so-so songs, not worth the money. I also got a chance to see them at some club, I almost feel asleep. The front guy ""Leroy"" just didn't sit right with me. In my opinion there are alot of better things to spend your money on."
4,German - I dont think so!,"The previous reviewer might like to know that the Fat Truckers were a Sheffield (UK) band. One from a long line of electonic/pop/dance acts from the city like; Cabaret Voltaire, The Human League, ABC, Pulp, Moloko, Babybird, Relaxed Muscle etc. However, they are on a German label, and like some of these bands drew inspiration from German electronica like Kraftwerk!In case you haven't guessed I'm from Sheffield and proud of our musical heritage."
4,Film noir,"One of the best of the ""Film Noir"" era, the script is first rate and the perfomances even better. Ray Milland is in top form as Nick Beal. Don't pass this one by."
5,Film Noir As Good As It Gets.,"An honest DA,Joseph Foster(Thomas Mitchell)is out to get racket czar,Frankie Faukner(Fred Clark)Foster remarks He will sell his soul to get Faukner.A note gets to Foster to be at a small,seedy,bar that night.Foster finds a mysterious,smooth talking, MR Beal(Ray Milland)who takes him up on selling him his soul and tells him how to get the gangster.Foster agrees and soon Faukner is as good as convicted.After that Foster runs for governor and MR Beal along with trashy Donna Allen(Audrey Totter)helps get him elected.Fosters wife Martha(Geraldine Wall)and best friend,REV Thomas Garfield(George Macready)suspect that MR Beal is non other than Satan.Looks like Foster has truly sold his soul to the devil for Eternity,but there is a way out.For me to know and you to find out.DONT MISS."
4,Great story!,After reading this book I went back and highlighted all of the deeply written paragraphs and read them over again. What great insight this author has to our inner thoughts and feelings that are never spoken to anyone. I have recommended this book to my friends and family.
2,A very dense read,"This book has lovely poetic language at times, however, I found myself often dozing off, the book unable to hold my interest. Durban's language was so dense I often had to reread paragraphs in order to better understand them. The characters never came alive for me. Durban has several phrases that become cliche by book's end, as she uses them so often. I was born in the South, I find it embarassingly duplicated here, as the stereotype we never hoped to be. Stagnant."
3,New York Dolls - 'Hootchie Cootchie Dolls' (Solid Sound),"Thirteen track compilation of supposedly 'unreleased' demos. Your typical Dolls material here, like ""Bad Girl"",""Babylon"",""Lonely Planet Boys"" among others. Let's not forget a couple of their well played covers,the Beatle's ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" and Chuck Berry's ""Back In The U.S.A."". Obviously aimed toward the completists. Thought the cover was interesting."
1,Awful,"This book is terrible. It tells a lot of guys to do things that every dating guru ever tells you to avoid. I have a hard time believing that the authors are that successful with women. Don't buy this under any circumstances, unless you want a friend to be extremely unsuccessful with women, then buy him this."
1,Naive,"This book so naive to the realities of dating and the nature of women that you have to wonder if the 2 authors who wrote it ever dated in their lives.The basic premise of theis book is that you if simply hit on a certain number of women, one will probably go out with you. That's like saying that that if I buy enough lottery tickets one day, I can possibly win the lottery.The techinques used to ""seduce"" women are even worse. One reviewer nailed it on the head regarding the techniques:the only thing they'll help you do is help you look gay.This book does not illustrate anything else to help seperate you from the other 500 guys trying to compete for the same woman. In fact, this book will not only not help you keep up with the competition but will help eliminate you all together. Get real."
2,Could women really be this stupid?,"While there were some interesting things about dating in this book (which, truthfully, any man over the age of 16 would already know), I found this book really hard to believe. ""How to Succeed"" is obnoxious and irreverent, all right. I guess that means I'm one of those hated Sensitive New Age Guys -- I believe in treating women with honesty, integrity and respect. Let's face it, if a woman doesn't return your calls or show up for a date its for a very good reason. It's not because she ""forgot."" Or that she's playing hard to get. How insulting! It's because she's NOT INTERESTED, plain and simple. Any further pursuit will only serve to make a guy look pathetic and desperate. I wish I could get my hands on the [purely fictional] bimbos that the authors write about in their ""case histories."" Because all the women I meet are WAY too smart to fall for any of this stuff."
1,how to succeed with women,"10 years ago I read a book "" how to understand women"" with the same cover(black background white letters. The writer , the book is exellent.This book is poor, lot of stories like soap opera.I rate :POOR"
1,This book is a joke,"This book does 2 things. First it promotes itself. Second it says nothing that a moron would not already know, like personal hygiene. Other than that it advocates low life tactics that can only turn women off. Their tactics are neither healthy nor likely to succeed, even if you want to be a low life with women. The authors' goal is very obvious: take the money and run. I would run away from this junk."
1,I've used all the techiques taught in this book,"I've used all the techiques taught in this book and I'm still masturbating. I don't know if it's me or the book but I let you decide. Although it didn't help me get a chick, it did boost my self-esteem up a bit. I'm feeling more confident about myself now. So this is actually a good self-help book. Probably the most important thing I learned from this book is to not seek validation from anyone but yourself. I used to seek all my validation from being able to find this really hot chick which I never ever did and so I feel [bad] all the time. But now I know it's no big deal...but my hand is getting tired."
1,For pigs and jerks,"I love the part about mindgames with a chick who stands you up. Wait a week or so, call her to apologize for standing her up and see what happens. Yea, man, this is real thing. Lying, cheating and double dealing."
1,Skip this one,"I picked up this book a few years ago, because well, as the book's title might suggest I had no clue on how to succeed in getting the women I wanted. However, this book wasn't helpful most of the information such as those ""romantic questions"" and other suggestions the author made just got me exactly what I was getting before reading this book, ""let's just be friends"" and the such. Until I came across The Game and Mystery's books, those have truly shown me how to succeed with women, skip this one, read those instead."
3,"Good Theory, Poor Application","This book is extremely focused on statistical evidence to suggest ways to meet and pick up women. Unfortunately it is mostly a summary of the statistics, and seems to suggest that all women are mindless robots who all behave in the exact same way. The book is focused mostly on sex as opposed to relationship building or dating.It certainly has some good pointers, and does a great job of summarizing the key points to each chapter. The material is extensive and well-organized, and as long as you're not expecting to figure out the age old secrets to love and happiness from reading a single book, this will provide you with a useful perspective and things to keep in mind next time you're hitting on that cute blonde at the end of the bar."
4,a skeptical approach,"I probably have the worst people skills in the world. I have tried everything and then I found this book. I finished this book in just a few days and needless to say, it is interesting. This book has done a little for me, but for all those so-called players out there, is this the stuff you guys really do? Any of you shy people out there, have you actually tried these techniques? Some of them just seem really liberal."
5,How to Succeed with Women,"This book is great! All women are different, and you'll learn from this book how to interact with each women you're with according to her interests and personality. Within the first week of reading this book, I got laid! Need I say more!"
2,Doesn't seem to work. And I've tried!,"I read this book about 6 months ago. The attitude of the authors is great, and it has completely changed my way of thinking about women. If what it says is true, then a lot of my conceptions about them were very wrong. However, I've tried to follow the techniques, and have not had a result yet. The authors claim over and over that they include everything you need to know and that if you follow their technique exactly then you'll have no problem, but it still hasn't worked. Maybe the rules are different on a college campus. I'm a med student, in great shape, and not bad looking, but I've still never had a date even after trying these techniques. And I still see the jerks getting all the women. Maybe I need a more remedial book."
5,"Common sense to some, practical wisdom to others","My only complaint is that the book is too long but don't get me wrong,(eager to try the techniques after chapter one) It is worth reading every word. If you want sex to happen to you in your life, read this book and work it. The hardest I find in the dating game is breaking the ice and keeping her interest. This book helped me build my confidence and has guided me back in to the dating world with a greater understanding and awareness toward women. However I havent gotten laid yet but I learned to really enjoy the company of many different women, danced with sexy women and kissed a young woman all in a week. Make the time, commit yourself to this book."
5,"Good solid, time tested, advice","I just bought the book over Valentines day weekend and have already devoured most of it. Thank you to the authors for finally writing a book that speaks to us. To our need to truly understand women while still being men.The most revealing aspect of the book has been the common mistakes men make in regards to dating. I found myself making all the classic mistakes, but now I know better. If you want to learn to meet, date, flirt, and hopefully bag women, this is the book for you. Hats off!"
5,Great book.. especially if your a computer geek or shy..,"I never had problems getting women.. However, This book is right on target. If you want a manual to getting laid.. this is definatly it..watch out though.. these traitors also have a book for women on how to watch out for guys like us that use this book..lol there getting it from both ends ;)"
1,I burned my copy!,"I'd say this book was mediocre and trite. You can judge a book by its cover here- an awful title for an awful read. It is written from a fairly feminist perspective despite the fact that the authors are men. It had a few good points but I could have spent my money in much better ways. A lot of it is stories (Bruce is the fictional 'hero' and Bob is the 'failure' and they keep re-appearing to illustrate the ideas in the book) and the stories are awful. There are checklists in each chapter (""what to do during the date"") and these stories recap what the checklists and ideas say. When one of the stories quoted the checklist verbatim (something like ""bruce touched his date on the arm at least once to make physical contact with her blah blah blah"") I nearly vomited. At that point I literally threw the book into a fire and made it useful. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
1,this is not for you - trust me,"i brought this book based on all the rave reviews, ... im painfully shy, and i read the book from cover to cover, i even made notes and memorised the scenarios and lines exactly, then i finally plucked up the courage to go out and actually try some of the dumb suggestions in this book, guess what, yes.... i crashed and burned on every girl i tried, and even the ... ones no one else was interested in, just gave me a cold stare. I thought ok maybe it was the bars i was going to so i tried the park, coffee shop, and book shop. Same result. Never again!! I felt like a real moron, i mean i feel low anyway, this just made me feel like i was pond scum."
5,Better than sex,"Before I read this book I only saw women as objects. You make friens and try to sleep with them. If you fail you just go to the next one. I personaly had alot of next ones. after reading just the first four chapters my luck with women changed. It is amazing how just changing what you wear and how you act can attract a whole new group of women, and still have access to the women that you were able to attract before. My relationships with women have evolved to something better than sex, I still get that but it is so much more fun to get it because I know that I was in controll to make it happen and not her and I love it."
4,I love this book,"This is a great book, it helped me find the answers to my questions I've alway had about women and relationships. This book helped me see all the mistakes I had been making with women and correct them. I highly recommend this book."
4,Decent for a book.,"When I got this book I expected it to tell me what to do in order to get a girlfriend. While the book does tell you useful things, most of it says what NOT to do. This helped me a lot because I did most of those things. Sometimes the book contridicts itself and gets you annoyed, but then again relationships are complicated. Nevertheless, it's worth buying and reading."
3,"somewhat useful, somewhat not...","I just finished that book and I will have to say that some of the things in the book are useful, like the habits of successful seducers but then there is too much emphasis placed on things that should already be known by men (grooming, hygeine, keeping your car clean..) there shouldnt 30 pages devoted to this. If a guy doesnt know how to dress nice for a date and keep himself clean then he's out of touch with civilization. The problem with alot of dating books is they don't give you enough advice on how to keep a woman during the 3 month to one year stage, instead placing most of the emphasis on picking up, and going out on the first few dates."
5,The best book ever written on dating,"This book has changed my life forever; not only with women, but with myself and the way I view my interactions with women. This book is the most comprehensive dating book I've read and really digs into deep issues about meeting and dating, but also about building confidence as a man and having a powerful life. I really thank the authors for the contribution to my life and to other men's lives as well. The information contained has helped me date more, flirt more, and feel much better about myself when I am around women."
4,Very informative,"I'm still reading this but I'll say its very informative. The authors reliance on this ""super flirt"" Bruce dude though is a bit too much. You use his tactics and you'll be labeled ""corny"".I think where this book succeeds most at is bridging the communication gap between men and women. I know I learned a thing or too on how women think/perceive things. That alone makes it a good buy."
5,A must read,"I have found this book to be the most useful guide to dating I have ever seen. I picked up the book as a joke when I was out with my buddies, but the book is chock full of useful and practical advice. I have used the theories to meet more women over the past few weeks than I have ever met before. I have even gone to bed with a couple.This book really helped me gain new levels of confidence with women and open my eyes to the ""bonehead"" mistakes I have been making all these years. If you do not feel confident with hot babes, this book is the answer."
3,"Fast Food, but not-so-bad tidbits of advice...","I do agree with the previous review about this being fast food mentally; but just like fast food, I believe there was some nutritional value to the book. Sure, I agree that you should work on improving yourself first - and this book advises the same. You need to have some passion in your life other than picking up women, or else you won't have much substance. This book is a good start. It helps to build confidence with approaching women and has a good premise ""date lots of women until the right one comes along - that way, when the right one finally comes along, you'll be able to charm her better than when you were once uncomfortable with women."" Although the book condones sleeping with multiple women and keeping someone on the side, I don't necessarily agree with this - but I think that most of the principles are sound."
1,How to turn women off.,"A lot of raunchy, high school level advice that will turn women off. A lot of paper, but no content. A lot of promises but no delivery."
1,Viciously sexist and totally insincere.,"This books reveals no insight at all in women. It rambles on and on pandering to men who just want to get laid. Not to suggest that Louis & Copeland's waste of good paper will help you with that objective either. I doubt it. Their book is written like off the top of their head and has nothing of substance, even for the man who is no more than a seducer.The book of the same title by Dr. Badalamenti is rich in insight and is written for men who wish to connect and not just have sex. Dr. Badalamenti's book is written with female psychology in mind and with deep insight into what women really want. Dr. Badalamenti's book helped me a great deal. Louis & Copeland's book has nothing to say that I would recommend for use or for understanding."
5,A great book!!!!!!,"I have read many books on how to meet and attract woman after my recent divorce. I was painfully shy and afraid of failing. The book is a manual not just for meeting and pleasing women, it is also a guide to dealing with people in general in an honest and forthright manner. I went from a lonely somewhat unhappy man to a social sucess with many women to date and have good relationships with in a serious and casual way. Its a lot about sex, but the total picture is even better when you open your mind to the principles of the book and enjoy life and the benifits of living to the fullest."
1,Useless and degrading,This book says nothing. Like I need to know to clean my car and nails for a date or to send flowers to a babe? Give me a break. These guys would market blank pages if they thought it would make some coin. Skip it.
2,I feel pretty stupid buying this book.,"I would give this book one star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly simplistic things these guys tell you. If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have ""game,"" and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department. Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women. I guess that works. There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you."
4,Get romance or get laid!,"This book will teach you how to deal with women and how to not screw up when you're trying to get approach one. This book will also teach you how to be an effective seducer, how and where to meet women, how to flirt properly in your own style, how to romance a woman, how to date women to know them , and, or seduce them, how to make a move for the first kiss, being the man of her dreams in bed, how to dump them , etc, etc. Using this book properly you can get a good relationship or simply a one-night stand, you decide which you want. It worked for me preety quickly."
4,"Clear, Concise, Detailed","I read this book cover to cover. I have not tried using the princicples presented, but they are detailed, clear, and I think they would work.The authors take you through the whole process of presentation (how you should look and act, more clean yourself up than changing what you are), where to meet and how to talk to a woman and it is a numbers game, how to flirt and get a priming date (safe location to explore if you really want to date the girl with an exit strategy), seduction date(s), and what to do thereafter....The book is thick and full of details. I think this is the place to start if you are looking for a book in this genre."
1,Von Question?,"You ask to much I am thinking!Your buok has me feeling bad. I have, how you say bad smells off the testeey. In my village women are attracted like bull with biggest wanger.So if I have to make all these changes to appearance how can I have time to meet librarian or whatever she supposed to be?Bouk not for me.A"
1,"450 PAGES FOR NOTHING, SAVE YOUR TIME","A VERY HEAVY BOOK, WITH A LOT OF TALES AND NOTHING USEFUL.YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF SKIMMING THROUGH THE PAGES, JUST TO GETTO THE END.THE BOOK IS NOT PRACTICAL AND IT IS FULL OF NONSENSE.I RECOMMEND YOU TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER BOOK, BUT NOT THIS.I AM ABLE TO RESUME THIS BOOK TO JUST 2 PAGESAND SELL IT FOR ONLY 0.5 DOLLAR.SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
1,Many of these reviews are fake,I got this book because there's so many great reviews for it. I tried some of the stuff and got dismal results. Now I realize that many (most) reviews here are fake and must have been written by the authors. They've even entered positive responses to some of the negative ones to defend themselves. This is dishonest and consistant with their bogus claim that their book is useful. Put more weight on the bad reviews.
3,How To Succeed With Sales Clerks,"Within this book are the systematic instructions for bedding a woman--a great peptalk for men who need some blunt advice to get them back on the saddle and in the sack again. However, the book falls a little short for me because there is something lacking in the spirit of the advice. The authors suggest you ""date"" a woman up until she starts to get too serious, and then...let her go. Why? Because its all about getting sex, and not really about forming a loving relationship with woman. Call me old-fashioned, but I have always had a hard time pursuing one without the other."
2,Good Attitude - Practical Advice Wanting,"I think these guys are on the money on their advice about how one should approach the dating scene: don't take it personally, maintain a positive self-image, be optimistic, playful with women, don't put all of your eggs in one basket, don't let rejection make or break your life, and don't let your success with the opposite sex control whether you are happy with your life. On the other hand, the book promises too much. I believe their tactics are terrible and will not work. I have tried them, and I have felt and looked foolish. I just can't see them working with even semi-intelligent women. Some of their lines are so corny: approach a woman behind a counter of a toy store and say something like, ""Hello Goddess of Toys."" I am not making this up. This is their advice. Save your $$$ and read this review again. Take the principles to heart. Forget their practical advice."
4,Good information packed in there with the cheese...,"There's may be a bit of a cheese factor to this book, but I saw positive results immediately upon taking its counsel, and continue to do so. (and that sentence alone should tell you something about my difficulties understanding the female mind)It might be off-putting to some to see such romantic, intimate interactions reduced to the procedural, bullet-pointed structure that Louis and Copeland provide, but they have benefited women as much as men by translating such important human skills into a form that the clueless male can absorb.They are also admirably ethical in their approach to relationships of all levels of commitment, despite the mischievous book cover and an occasional tendency toward leon phelpsity.Overall, I'd say it's a worthwhile read even if you're already fairly successful with women, or a woman yourself."
3,So- so book,"It has good advice inside but is very repitious. Also I read How to Succeed with Men. Most of the stories are the same (just switch gender and name) He tells men how to get sex and tell women how to get a committed relationship. He advices women to not have sex too soon encourages them to be late for the date. He tells men to be on time because the women will be late and to make a plan to get her in bed (and other connections between the two books that enforces his screenplay of how the date should go.) Although I found some of his advice to be helpful, most of his advice says to take as must abuse as possible. Such as let him/her stand you up three times. Or leave messages twice even if they aren't returned, Don't say things that might offend and avoid conflict(even in the relationship), always say ""you're right"" and other things that goes against every other dating book in America."
5,Great book,Excellent step-by-step instructions for those of us who can admit to not knowing everything about women.
5,Inspiration for My Garage Gym,When I received the package I was really please with the clarity of the photo. I immediately purchased a frame for it and put it in a worthy place in my gym.
1,this is the worst movie i have ever tried to sit through,i love steve reeves as Hercules..but this movie is horrible ...a sleeper.dont buy it.
3,RIP Steve Reeves,"With the death of Reeves on May 1, 2000, it seems a lot of people are turning nostalgically to the tidy cache of films this singular star left behind. A departure from the standard 60s peplum films with glistening, loincloth-clad muscles bulging all over the place, ""Warrior"" is not bad at all. Reeves plays Hadji Murad, a rebel Russian leader who gets into all kinds of trouble to remain true to his ideals of liberty and justice. The film makers had to do some pretty fancy footwork to come up with plot points to rid him of his traditional folk garb so you could see his real talent: his body. But overall, the usually cheesy sets and production values are unusually high and you really DO wonder how our muscleboy is going to get out of the jams he sems incapable of avoiding. If you're a Reeves fan and haven't seen this one yet, or if you're merely interested in a non-traditional view of Russian life in the mid 19th century, check out ""The White Warrior""."
2,"Beautiful but Flawed, Artic leaves me Cold","Beautiful fixture BUT:It comes with no instructions and no pop-up rod, and once installed it sounds like an airliner taking off when you turn it on even a little. Can be heard throughout the house.AND caution: it requires 1 3/8"" holes. Wish I'd known that before I ordered."
5,a beautiful faucet,"A very beautiful faucet. Definitely adds a modern flare. The issues with noise are because you can not have the water pressure turned up too high. When the water inflow to the faucet is properly adjusted, you will have no problem."
2,Good for 2 years,"Installed this product two years ago. I love the look of it, but almost6 right away it started to get ""water"" marks etched in the glass. I guess you need to know if you have a lot of chemicals in your water--the marks don't come out. Now, after two years, it is leaking around the glass and the hot water does not come out properly. I guess in the end, you get what you pay for."
1,USB to PS/2 doesn't work consistently,"Not happy with this at all. I thought it would work OK at the start. But it looses connection so often. I ended up buying a new keyboard, and tossed this in the junk pile."
1,Does Not Work,"If you order, you have to wait for it to ship from overseas. 1 Month in my case. Then the big disappointment. The computer will recognize the adapter, but not the devices connected (keyboard/mouse) I bought 5 of the because they were so cheap. All five are now in the trash. Waste of time and money."
1,PS/2 /USB adapter,"This item though inexpensive, did not work. There is no signal from both PS/2 outlets. I tried it on another machine-same result."
1,No good!!,"Took over a month to arrive from Japan, then it will not work on the machines I need it for, Vendor keeps emailing me they are working just fine on their XP machines, to try again, I don't use XP anymore, we use a newer version of Windows, It should have specified it only works on XP. Don't waste your time with this one.it will cost more to return than it cost to buy."
2,Doesn't Replace an actual USB Hub,"Straight-wired usb to psb doesn't always work, or works intermittenly. Be sure this is what you're after before you purchase it.Tried it with various PS-2 keyboards and USB jacks on the computer side...with limited success.Though it's only a few dollars, consider that basic USB devices (like logitech keyboards for example), are usually around $10.00 in 2010 dollars U.S. Unless you got a special use, might not be worth the hassle."
1,I NEVER GOT IT!!!,"Ordered on 11 November, credit card was charged that same day. E-mail followed that the item was going to be shipped from Hong Kong and would be at my door on Dec 27. That was yesterday and it isn't here."
5,SMART BUY,"I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE LOW PRICE. I RECEIVED IT, PLUGGED IT RIGHT IN AND IT WORKS GREAT! THANK YOU!"
2,mouse not recognized after laptop reboot and some time after working a while,"have unused mouse and keyboard with PS2 connector; so bought this to apply them with my laptop.mouse not recognized after rebooting the laptop every time (the keyboard part is usually recognized); Need to reconnect the USB connector, sometimes, after reconnect, the keyboard went crazy (output several characters for each typed one), need to reconnect several times.sometimes, after working for a while, the mouse can only be recognized as moving up/down, not left/right, or not be recognized at all.I'm wondering if there's any thing that can be done to improve the experience."
1,Doesn't work at all,Doesn't work at all. I tried it on 2 different PCs. I'm not new at this. Don't buy this product.
1,Didn't work on two boards I tried.,"I tried it on a new Unicomp keyboard and an older IBM Model M. It wouldn't work on either. My unit could be DOA, but not worth sending back."
2,Didn't work but arrived quickly,"This product arrived in an amazingly short time but it ended up not working for me :( Not sure if it was the product itself, or the keyboard I was trying to use but it would not register on the computer. It was like it wasn't even connected though everything was secure.For anyone that is interested:The computer I was trying to connect it to is a Gateway laptop running Vista home basic and the keyboard is a ps/2 inland brand."
1,Not great,"It's a buy for the money. But does not connect to my Mac steadily, which needs frequent restarting of my Mac. Finally, I had to buy a USB keyboard. So am not happy with its reliability."
1,Didn't Work,"Not much to add to the review title. I guess I could mention that it took a little longer to receive than I expected, because it shipped from China. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known that."
1,Horrible,"This adapter is horrible. It will drop keystrokes intermittently, and cause others to repeat at random intervals. Gaming is impossible, as well as any form of accounting. Typing any faster than maybe 10 words per minute results in gibberish."
1,IT SUCKS,they mailed iot to me 22 Jan. and it finally arrived today 9Feb. and will not work is not compatable with windows 7 or above. I'ld send it back but the postage is more than I paid so I stuck with it....oh well....one of the very few things I ever got though Amazon that totally sucked. not even worth a phone call DON'T ORDER IT
1,Close but not quite,I ordered a USB to PS/2 adapter and got a RCA style video/sound to USB adapter. For the few bucks that it cost it was not worth the cost or the effort to send it back.The good news is that I got it quickly and the price would have been great............... if only it had been the right part
5,"Ships from China, but arrived quickly","Ordered the adapter and a notebook riser on the same order. The adapter order showed 2 different estimated arrival dates, one was something like 6 weeks out and the other the about 10 days. I don't have a local electronics store and wasn't in a hurry so I placed the order anyways.So, it turns out the adapter ships from China (!!). Seems kinda far away for a $2 order, but they are all made there so I guess it isn't too surprising that you can now order directly from China. The adapter arrived within a week and well before the riser which shipped from here in the US. It is working fine, so even though the shipping was a bit odd...it worked out."
2,Does not work,"Inexpensive, so I thought I would give this a try. Ordered three units, all three were defective. Keyboard and mouse not responsive at the BIOS level or after windows competely boots up. Borrowed a Startech version from a friend, which works perfectly. Don't waste your time and efforts with the low cost item, do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for the StarTech version."
5,My Old Keyboard Now Works Again!,I bought this adapter to allow me to continue to use my year 2000 Compaq keyboard with my new computer. This adapter did the job and I am now in business again for a few more years!
5,Works Great!,"I ordered this USB to PS/2 Adapter cable to use my old trackball with my new laptop. It words great! The price was a lot cheaper than any place locally. Although I had to wait a couple of weeks for shipping, it was worth it."
1,failed to preform as advertised,it was a poke in the dark thing that this would solve my problem the computer didn't even recognize that it was connected
1,Works Great Only for a While,"The device worked great for a couple of months and then the computer failed to recognize it. The connections coming out of the device can move back and forth in and out of the device. I think the connections came loose internally or shorted something out. If you buy this, tape down the connections coming out of the device so they can't move. The item was so cheap, I bought it to find out if the technology would work because I read so many reviews where people couldn't get these type of devices to work. It worked great with a COMPAQ keyboard dating back to 1999 and an old microsoft mouse. Now that I know the technology works, I'll pay a little more money for something sturdier."
1,JUNK!,It's the same junky part sold under different names. The mouse works fine but the keyboard works for a few seconds if at all.
2,A Slow Boat From China.... Well Hong Kong,"I am happy to say the USB to PS/2 Adapter workes very well. I plugged it in and the keyboard worked great. Some other reviewers had problems, I did not.If you are wanting to type anything from your key board using this adapter in the next six weeks that is not going to happen and this is not the product for you.Go with the more expensive option. Our adapter was shipped from RM 1007 Kwong Sang Hong in Hong Kong via what I think is a boat. We ordered this over six ago and it arrived one day before the end of November.In summary, it works, unfortunately you have to wait a VERY LONG time for delivery."
1,Beware of Gender!!,"I purchased this adapter so that I could continue to us my favorite Logitech keyboard (PS/2) with my new system. Upon receiving the item I discovered that the green connector was keyed female (correct) and the purple connector was keyed male (incorrect). I checked every old mouse, keyboard and system and found that all mice and keyboards were male and motherboards are female. The purple male connector was useless. Did not cost enough to hassle getting a refund and tossed it.BTW - Purchase a new Logitech K800 illuminated keyboard and love it.Note: The picture shows two female connectors which is correct."
1,Questionable product,I bought these hoping I could attach my KVM switch to some new HP servers. The servers just don't see them. I have no idea if they will work on anything else but Server 2008 R2 doesn't recognize them.
1,"Well, it worked for a bit....","but now only the keyboard works. My folks have one of those Microsoft PS2 ergonomic keyboards and Mom wanted to use my old Logitech Trackman (also PS2) The Asus MB only has the keyboard PS2 connector so I figured this was the way to go. It took a little plugging in and unplugging and plugging in again to get the hardware recognized and trackball and keyboard both worked for a week or so, but a couple days ago both quit. Some more plugging in and unplugging brought the keyboard back to life, but the trackball (the whole reason for this setup) never functioned again. Not worth the hassle to return."
3,"It's ok, could be better, could be worse","funny how I am using the device to type this review.... it works! However, I could not play video games with the keyboard. the device seems to not let you hold down more that one key, so it was impossible for me to use the arrow keys and hit another key at the same time since it would ""forget"" that i was still holding onto the arrow key to move the character so the character would all of the sudden stop moving.In short, it is good for typing, not good for video games that require you to hold down more than one key at a time.I did not test the mouse since i didn't need that part."
3,"Functional, but limiting","The adapter works. That's about the best thing I can say about it. With it, my keyboard can type, but every other feature is disabled. No media buttons, no volume control, no internet navigation, nada. The price is really hard to beat. I bought another one from a retail store in my area for about $18 (like 3 times the price of this one) and bought this one so I could save money and return the other. Turns out, all the extras don't work with this one and they do with the expensive one. Summary, this adapter marginally functions in a pinch, but won't make your eyes sparkle."
1,USB to PS/2 adapter,"I bought this adapter because I got a new PC (HP) and the mouse and keyboard are both USB. I have always used and liked IBM keyboards, so I hoped this would allow me to do so again. It worked on the IBM keyboard initially, the 2nd day it got flakey when it automatically began typing a long string of a single number or letter. Unplugging the adapter would get me back to normal for half an hour or so, then it failed again. After 3 or 4 days it failed completely, and I am back to my USB HP keyboard, which works, but not as well as an IBM."
1,Not such a deal,"This adapter did not work well at all.......the USB end did not fit well in the computer and, if jiggled, would make contact. Realize it was priced very low, but to return it would have cost ten times more than the price of the item.........Would not recommend it."
2,Mediocre quality,"For the price I suppose I can't be too disappointed, but the USB cord seems to intermittently lose it's connection to my PC. Every so often I have to unplug the adapter then put it back in. Lately I seem to need to do this more often. Besides this I haven't had any issues with the adapter, but I've only had the adapter for a month or two and at this rate soon it will no longer be worth using with the frustration it causes.Edit, about two months after writing this review, I threw out the cord because it had to be replugged in too frequently to use. All in all, the cords lasted about a third of a year and the issue started immediately after buying them and only got worse."
1,Disappointed,"Perhaps because it contains both keyboard and mouse connectors, my computer does not recognize the keyboard at boot. At any rate, didn't work for me."
1,Only lasted for 3 weeks...,"It was good while it lasted. I guess, for its price of less than 2 bucks, it's worth the price."
1,does not work with Windows 7,"Upgraded my husband's computer and wanted to connect his favorite old trackball and keyboard, thought this would do it cheaply, but it was not recognized at all. Guess there is a reason Radio Shack's was $15."
4,Slightly glitchy but overall great.,"The first unit I got was dead on the keyboard side; I got in touch with the company and they were excellent with their customer service. They sent me a new one within a few days and it works great! Occasionally the cursor will get stuck when I'm typing at where the mouse is, and once in a while it'll freeze entirely, but for under $2 I really can't complain. Great little adapter."
5,These are marvelous items,even though the price seems too low. I have tried several adapters with this being the only one that works. I actually purchased a couple of extra ones just in case. I will not hesitate to purchase from this seller in the future.
3,Didn't work for me,"Needed to replace the keyboard on my Dell E521. Couldn't get a USB keyboard to work in the USB ports, so I thought I'd try it with an adapter for the PS2 keyboard port. Still no luck. But the item seems fine, quality and workmanship looks as expected."
5,Cheap but works with my older KVM,I didn't want to buy a USB based KVM but had a PC that did not have PS/2 ports. These were cheap enough to try and they worked like a charm. Little trouble being recognized at first but for the money that wasn't a big deal.
5,Awesome Product,I picked up this product for $1.97 (Shipping Included) I can't even find it for that much at my local stores. It arrived about 15 days before predicted. When I received it the package that was inside the envelope was open and the product did look like it was used and cleaned up but after plugging it in and plugging in my mouse and keyboard to my laptop I realized that it works just fine.Summary:Great ProductDoesn't appear to be new but fully workingFast DeliveryCHEAP
5,Excellent guide for parents of teens,"Most of us parents are not taught how to have open and healthy conversations with kids about sex and the myriad of topics associated with it. I found the author's expertise and common sense approach a terrific resource, and I wish I had read it a long time ago .. like when my kids were still in grade school. I highly recommend it."
3,Bootleg Blu Ray,"No commentary, no scene selection menu, no special features at all. The only menu available is to select 5.1 or French stereo audio. The image is 1080i which looks fine, but for some reason my tv drops the signal intermittently and I have to pause the player to get it back. This is the only disc out of my Blu Ray library to ever do that.I recommend the DVD version over this one as it contains a full compliment of special features and maybe even the same video quality."
4,Great celtic music with a great christian message.,"This disc is a lot of fun. The opening track delivers a punch and a message about the joys of responding to the invitation to the ""Party Goin' on Upstairs"" .You can tell this group is having a good time as they plow through ""Rolling Home"", slow down for a minute with the ballad ""Come Back Down"" (about the troubles we see now, and will things be restored ""when you come back down""), then jump right back in with the fast moving ""Living it up When I Die"" (self explanatory).Sometimes the vocals are a little weak, but the pipes, fiddle, guitars (they even got Phil Keaggy in there on the very strange track called ""Face""), organs, drums... even an acordian... really keep things together.This is a great second release (in the States). Get this CD now, and don't miss them if they come to town; they give a great performance."
1,Worst toy ever invented!!!!,"This is the worst, most disappointing toy I ever wasted my money on. The tube that dips into the water resevoir for the left arm was too short, therefore that arm didn't work. The trigger was very hard to depress for my 4 and 8 year old sons. The water doesn't shoot a good distance, so the balls, and cannons just sort of fall off. I strongly suggest that no one buys this toy for any kid who is likely to be disappointed with it. It went right back to the store!!!"
2,Just what I need to read,but I and most deaf people can't afford the price of information we need. My sister and I are deaf and our entire family is falling apart I believe because a dead parent decided not one of us should learn to sign. So now I have an ex-sister who dis-invited me to my eldest nephew's wedding for reasons I do not understand and I suspect she can't explain. The hearing win in our family and in the world at large but information we need is priced out of our hands.
3,Somewhat no so smooth,"I purchased this with high expectations but it fell short on the taste. I was very exited to get this one at first but it wasn't what I thought it would be. However, it's not a bad coffee choice. It was still okay. Maybe my batch was not as good as others."
1,Very harsh coffee,"This coffee is NOT what I expected! I have had Kona coffee before which was spectacular! I guess that is what I was looking for. But you will not find it here. This is a blend, and that is probably why. I will never buy this again!"
2,Not what expected,"We usually drink french roast coffee (San Francisco Bay) that we grind daily and we've been enjoying that kind of coffee for a while. We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast. I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged. As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry. I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee. I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success. I don't know if I got a stale bag or what, but my experience left me with a bad taste. Amazon was great and they offered a refund. Thank you Amazon!"
2,"Burnt, with subtle tones of burnt","I like my coffee black, but found this pretty much undrinkable without milk, and my office mates agreed. It really does just taste charred. I'm not sure if it's all like this or I just got a bad batch. Anyways, the price isn't bad, but I can't recommend this to anyone. I'm still looking for a good, reasonably priced 5lb bag."
3,"Good Coffee, Not a Great Coffee","First, I have to confess that I expected this Kona blend to knock my socks off. It didn't do that, or even come close to it, but it is a perfectly adequate coffee even if it is not what I would call a great coffee. It is very mild, not bitter, and can be made in various strengths according to individual preference with no bitter after-taste. I don't feel that I wasted my money but I am not sure I shall buy Jeremiah's Kona Blend again."
2,Kona Blend lacks flavor.,I found Jeremiah's Pick Kona Blend lacking flavor. I tried every trick I know to bring out all the taste it had but still found it weak.
3,Jeremiah's Coffee Beans,"These beans produce a nice tasting brew. However, the beans look old and dry. After opening the bag, I immediately put them into 1 pound bags and froze, hoping to extend the life of the beans."
2,Okay coffee,"A lot of reviews say this coffee is smooth, my wife and I disagree. We think it is very bitter. We will not order these beans again but are open to trying other Jeremiah's products..."
3,Not as good as others in the series...,"I purchased WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN THE ENLIGHTENMENT and loved it for the myraid of tiny details,fascinating illustrations and concise chronological layout of the political, economical, and social scene. I am less impressed with WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN EUROPE'S ROMANTIC ERA. The opening chapters hop around between 1800 and 1840 with dizzying speed and the novice French historian would be hard pressed to follow.The images are wonderful, but the scope of this book was too grand and the facts are condensed and thrown at the reader too fast, never really letting them learn and appreciate the rich society that was 19th century Europe."
3,Not bad but not the best in this great series,I have quite a number of the books in this What life was like series. I have generally enjoyed both the visual aspects and the texts and have given high marks to other books in the series. This particular book is great on visuals but appears to fall short on the text. The key figures during this period are adequately presented but the interweaving in of their lives is patchy.
3,What madness is this?,"Dinobot is a decent, though unspectacular, beast-era Transformer. As he was featured on the cartoon, he tends to be one of the more popular figures.This toy, however, is the FIFTH release of the same toy mold in the US, not to mention the couple of slight remolds also released, and was released in no small quantities. I can think of NO reason for the price to be so high, particularly as a cursory search on a popular auction site turned one up on the first page for one seventh of this price."
4,A great guidebook.,"A highly comprehensive and detailed architectural guidebook. Although there a plenty of photographs, it's a shame that these are all in black and white."
2,Could have and should have been better,"This book is a major disappointment, it is hardly thorough and tries to cover to much ground and in doing so really does not cover anything. The book has very few pictures, which is so odd in guide of this kind, all you get is short discriptions of each building and I guess from this you are suppose to glean the image of the building, uh o.k. This really is the worst city architecture guide I have come across, I usually love these guides, I have reviewed several and have given them high marks, I love L.A., I think that is why I am so disappointed in this particular book. I had expected so much more, L.A. has so many interesting buildings, it's a shame that it does not have an architectural guide to match. Hopefully someday someone will write a guide deserving of the title of this book; the city of angels desevers better, heck Buffalo deserves better than this."
1,These guys suck the big one,"Well, I've listened to this cd, and I saw them live two weeks ago with Papa Roach. They royally blew the big one. I couldnt' stand them. They were actually worse than the first opening band, Fight of Your Life. I couldn't believe that these guys actually HAVE a record deal."
1,My score would be -5 if it were possible,"I absolutely, and with every fiber of my being, hate this band. I first heard their music on Burnout 3, and from then on I knew I would hate them forever. The fups were playing at a venue near my house one afternoon (not even a night show, how sad) and I was tempted to go, just so I could b-slap each one of them, and thank them for ruining my Burnout soundtrack. I would say you should burn the CD, but the toxic fumes emitted would just be more damage caused by their product. Ugh.EDIT: there's got to be a reason there are so many used copies being sold for as low as 55 cents."
5,Fups... new sound to deal with boring lifestyle,aright so i just picked up the fups debut cd and i must say that it is a very good buy. first let me say that it is full of energy and great catchy hooks. to me that sounds like good music. i think that the fups will start a new generation of music. the cd has anthems for all and is a great cd to cruise to while with you girls or boys for that matter. these boys have really done it they have broken down the wall of boring music. great for all people from ages 11 to whatever. go get the cd it rules.
4,whats with all the negative waves on reviews?,"I'm 54 years old, and I love the sound of this band, their humor, and their expression of timeless teenage problems. When I first heard the album, I told my daughter they were a cross of The Ramones and Simple Plan. The negative reviews seem to be from the live experience, which I cannot comment on. But the album itself, in my opinion, is kick-ass. I love it."
5,Best album EVER!,"This album is probably the best I've ever heard. The F-Ups are a great band, and this album definatly shows it. PICK IT UP NOW! I promise you won't regret it!"
2,another overpolished punk band,"I was attracted to this band after hearing the song ""I Don't Know"" on the Warped Tour comp. Pretty much all of the songs are the same as this. The drum line is catchy but the lyrics are extremely weak. The name of the CD is ""Screw You."" What would you expect? They have this stereotypical punk image where as long as you have the spikey hair and piercings you're a punk. Well, most true punks have some political or philosophical message to say in the lyrics and there is none of that on this album. If you like this kind of band, I guess you should also check out The Offspring's new CD's, they're pretty similar to this. But if you're looking for real punk with meaning in their lyrics, search for bands on independent labels. I have yet to find a punk CD on a major label that I would be satisfied to call ""punk""."
5,This Album rocks,"First of all i have to say that this album is totally awesome, and i would suggest buying it. I got to hear and meet The F-Ups at Warped Tour, and they are an awesome band. The song Take A Look At Your Son Now is a song that more than likely all teenagers can relate to. Same with I Don't Know, all of the songs on this album are great, it is highly recommended by me. Almost all of the songs on this can be related to by teenagers, and it makes you feel good to know that you aren't the only one who experiences stuff like that."
5,The F-ups do it right.,They take simple riffs and mix them with Blazing lead guitar licks and lyrics that will never get old or sound stupid. This is a must own cd and it will not let you down.
2,"So terrible, it's funny!!!","Obviously, some film company knows that money can be made off of viewers who want to see more films by men of color with men of color. This is a low-budget, Latino, ""gangsta"" film that should never have been made. The script is terrible. The acting is terrible. The humor falls flat on its face. There is a threadbare plot. The protagonists are stupid. The unique thing about this movie is that most of the characters are overweight. The protagonists wouldn't make the stupid mistakes they made if they weren't constantly driving off the highway to get food. I want actors of color to have more roles and get paid, but if this is their only route, then the whole world is struggling!"
5,I Love these picks,"I use these picks primarily for strumming, but they have a great grip, and work great. I doubt they'll ever wear out, and though I use .60-.80 for whatever I'm doing on my acoustics, these are among my favorite picks, and I use these the Clayton's, and a few others, but for .60 picks these are really nice, and I tend to pick them out of the box when I start to warm up with a pick."
3,"Good picks, crack easy","I like these picks as I think they bring out the best tone from my guitar. However, after using the .60's for a couple of weeks they started to crack. I have the heavier gauge ultex picks and they have held up nicely so far."
3,Slips out of my fingers,"They might be great pick and a long lasting one too but the ones I got, seem to slip off my fingers every time I play heavy or even strum. I like the grip on the tortex picks better!"
2,Good picks but...,I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!
5,Best book in category,"Down-to-earth, practical guide for individuals to understand work marketplace, evaluate their situation, define and reach goals. Clearly written, engaging--the best book I've seen on the topic. Real life examples back up user-freindly information. I'm a career counselor myself and would recommend this to all clients and individuals seeking to steer their own course."
5,Always a hit with the entire family!,"If you've never read or watched ""Charlie and Lola"", you've been missing out! This adorable British brother and his little sister never fail to entertain while teaching valuable life lessons. My soon-to-be four year old daughter danced around with delight when she opened the package to find her ""favorite and her best"", Charlie and Lola! (Our ten year old and eight year old are big fans as well!) We watch the videos, read the books and listen to the music while riding in the car! I promise you'll become a fan too!"
4,the creepiness continues...,"'The House' is the third installment of Michael McDowell's southern gothic novel series. Actually, it seems to me all these books are literally part of the same book but for whatever reason the publisher divides them into small chunks. There is literally a seamless transition moving between books.If you are reading this review I trust you have read the preceding two books in the series. If not, go directly to the first in the series ('The Flood') and get started! Otherwise ... what can I say? 'The House' is exactly what you'd expect. Great characterizations, atmospheric, with a slow but infectious story. It seems that women wear the pants in this series; perhaps this is a statement of life in the old South?Bottom line: Blackwater III doesn't disappoint. Recommended."
3,WHy is this book worth so much?,"The facts:1. A photogenic baby is pushed into modeling by her controlling, obsessed mother.2. She turns into a lovely child who is a regular child model3. When she turns 12, she morphs into a teen who can look older than her years and so, based on her looks, she becomes the hot model of the moment.4. Great photographers get some great photos of her, but some of them toe the line between sexiness and child porn. Is is ""art"" or ""porn"" when a child poses topless in a bathtub, looking seductively at the camera? Is it cute or borderline dangerous to have a young girl play a child prostiture, potentially encouraging the fantasies of pedophiles? These are some of the real and controversial issues surrounding the career of Ms. Shields.5. But she never became (yet) a world class actress. She was simply gorgeous.And this is enough to form an obsession...and boost up the price of this book? Guess so. People can be so strange."
4,"Small House, Large World","I received Barbara Dickenson's book as a gift from my two wonderful granddaughters, ages 8 and 9, and fell in love with the writing, the characters and of course, Wynfield Farms. As a senior citizen, I can relate to many of the things that happen at Wynfield and to its inhabitants. When my days of being self sufficient and living alone are at an end, I sure hope there is a Wynfield Farms and a Rose McNess in my future. Through Barbara Dickersons books, I have learned that getting old is a privilege and that you are not out to pasture just because you have lived a few years. I feel that all ages would love the wit and humor provided by this wonderful book.I read it with great pleasure. No, it isn't just for seniors like me. Thanks to Barbara for both of her lovely books and I sure hope there are sequels. I am anxiously awaiting the next Rose McNess adventure."
5,Castle,Have just learned that Ms. Dickinson is honoring us with another episode of Rose McNess. I can't wait. I have longed for another visit and it is supposed to happen in December. Keep looking--I know it will be as wonderful as the first two episodes of Rose's Roamings.
4,GF alternative to Ramen,"GF alternative to Ramen. Spring onion flavor could be found over seasoned. Benefits from letting the noodles set for a few extra minutes to really absorb the broth. Great for camping. Decent price on Amazon, I try not to pay more than $1 a package (Almost $1.50 at my local store.)."
1,Didn't get the product I paid for and ordered,"I ordered a throwback Jersey on Dec. 13th 2007. I was supposed to have recieved it no later than Dec. 21st just in time for Christmas. However on Dec. 21st I received a T-shirt instead. After leaving several messages and e-mails I called again Jan. 2 and finally spoke to someone at Sports Magick. He told me it must have been sent to someone else. 2 days later a lady calls me and tells me they found one and it will be shipped the next day and I should receive it by Jan. 8th. Shocker, it didn't come so I called back and spoke to a guy and he said he would check and call me right back. 3 days later I called agian and he said he has no idea where one is but if I wanted the T-shirt instead he would refund me my money minus the T-shirt. It looks like I will never use Amazon or Sportsmagick again."
5,A must read for all women (and those who love them)!,"This book helped me to learn not only the options available to me in certain health care situations, but let me feel comfortable requesting those options. It also gave information on how to be more aware of and comfortable with my own body. It is high on my gifts-to-give list this year.Our Bodies Ourselves has helped my pregnant friends and I deal with their pregnancies and births as a positive natural process rather than as a disease requiring specialized intervention. Giving arguments for and against (and mostly against) many standard but unnecessary medical procedures and practices for pregnant women (that are perpetuated through an uninformed media) helped my friends choose good doctors and midwives to make their birth experience dignified. They know that they had the information to make the best decisions for themselves and their children whether the births were easy or traumatic."
2,...and the enemy is us...,"I got the 25th anniversary edition, dated 1998, for 25 cents or so at my local library. What I read was mildly interesting but not enlightening. I got a bit infuriated when, researching 'anorexia', I saw two entries which basically said: 'Minimize the effects of stress by eating well, exercising, meditating, having foot rubs and long warm baths and taking (maybe 10 minutes?) to put things in perspective to get a grip. With 'friends' like these, who needs...??? Whatever happened to 'throw the bum out'? Tell your parents to fudge themselves. Why not spend the next 10, 20, even 30 YEARS getting a grip?? I'm not even sure I'm going to bother with the chapter I was initially interested in: 'Working Toward Mutuality. Our Relationships with Men.'"
3,The Iron Giant,"Great movie for grandchildren. We did watch the whole movie and had a few laughs over the Iron Giant,s behavior."
3,Good young adult & teen fantasy book,"I recently recently re-read the Lost Years of Merlin series after purchasing this book, which I had been missing previously. Overall the series is pretty good, although the author makes a habit of introducing at least one annoying side kick in every book.The basic premise of the novel is that Merlin needs to learn 7 ""songs"", or lessons. The reader's interest in maintained by the unusual manner in which each lesson is learned, rather than what the cliche lessons are themselves. The writing style is unusual, as it is in first-person perspective, but is otherwise straight forward. Nothing spectacular, but not a bad story if you have spare time, either. Fans of Merlin stories, or just magic in general would like it."
5,The Stars are Numerous,"This was a really good book. I liked it. Is that the only thing everybody says? Because it's true. Go all along the line of all these reviews and there's nothing bad. So listen to me, folks -- this book is good. Merlin gets really far."
4,The seven songs of wizardry,"In this wonderful sequel to the lost years of Merlin he must race to master the soul of each of the seven songs before time runs out, and even if he can master all of the songs souls he must then face the Cyclops, Baylor. As Merlin and his friend Rhia race to find and master the soul of each song they meet up with all of their old friends and some old enemies. It has been prophesized that only a child of human blood, like himself, can defeat Baylor, but as his grandfather the great wizard Tuatha said, ""the truth has many faces""."
3,This Book is Good,This was almost as good as the first- but not quite. The storyline fell somewhat short of expectation and many of the outcomes of the conflicts were predictable. A few good twists and turns but still not reaching full potential.
3,Beg to Differ,"I found 'Samra' quite a disapointment. I loved his first, but found this second solo offering bland and featureless. Faudel might have merely lost that poignant adolescent wail in the natural course of maturing or could it just be sabotaged by nondescript material and muddy production? Perhaps it can re-emerge in future work with better songs The best thing I can say about this is that it makes me appreciate the wonder that was 'Baida' even more."
2,Insufficient explanation - not a good yoga video,"I bought all three series of prenatal yoga and I regret it. This video does not offer walk throughs on how to do many of the poses. She just quickly changes from one pose to the next, without explaining how to do it, give you time to inhale or exhale properly, show you where and how to position hands and feet for support, or how to twist core body, etc. Both her verbal explanations and visuals leave me frustrated, wondering if I should position the hands one way or another for a particular pose. What is worse, the camera does not follow many of her important movements, focusing sometimes only on her face or on a detail of her shirt, instead of showing how she is positioning her arms, hand, toes, etc. even when she puts them behind her body -- these are important details in yoga, because incorrect poses can lead to injuries."
1,video for experts,"This video was clearly for those yoga experts or people that do yoga quite often. I am not new to yoga, but I had quite a bit of difficultly completing this video. This is not a relaxing exercise for those in first trimester that experience fatigue AND nausea!!!! I'm not impressed, and feel ripped off by the whole experience!!!!!"
5,it's for anyone!!!!!,"I'm new to yoga, so I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but, boy was I wrong. The workout out was really relaxing and the poses were not too difficult to follow. A great way to get back into shape (before and after). Sara Holliday's yoga workout is not just for pregnant women. Highly recommened!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Poor sound and picture quality,The quality of this video is very poor. Additionally there's really not much difference between this and a regular yoga workout (at least for the first trimester). Maybe the other two are better.
4,Good For Beginner,"This book provides a good summary of important managerial skills. Briner does a good job of correlating these skills with the life and teachings of Jesus although at times he seems to be reaching to make the correlation. I'm new to management and I chose this book because of the title. It is an easy read. I enjoyed Briner's engaging writing style. Each management skill is presented individually in a chapter, which allows for easy class discussion. Overall I think it is a great book for managers and Christians."
1,Very Disturbing Book,"This is a very disturbing book on many levels. I find it to be quite contradictory to the basic tenets of Christianity. For example, the author says in the Public Relations section that John the Baptist was a great PR man for Jesus...(hmmm...is he proposing that an organizational leader is Jesus and the workers are the followers???!!!) He says John the Baptist 'knew his place' and that too many people think they are the 'stars' at their job when the only 'stars' should be the executives and the enterprise. It is hard to imagine any competent manager or executive believing this nonsense. I would never want my employees to think they were my disciples!"
3,One Book // One Week - The Management Methods of Jesus,"The Management Methods of Jesus, by Bob Briner, takes the life, words and deeds of Jesus and applies them to the world of business. Briner uses the life of Jesus in the gospels to show how the world of business would benefit from his example. Each section is short enough to read as a daily inspiration for anyone in the modern business place.Read more of my review of The Management Methods of Jesus and other books at...[...]"
5,Super helpfull,"I bought this bag because i needed to take a lot of baby stuff with, and it is perfect."
5,I can't believe there is only going to be one season!,"Ok, I really dislike most of what is on TV. I am not a snob or anything, but hey, there is nothing ""real"" about ""reality"" shows, folks. This show has become one that my daughter not only agree on watching, but like to watch together. Togetherness with a pre-teen is primo time. I am looking forward to the DVDs because at least we'll have that. I am also signing the Save The Finder petition in hopes of some other network picking it up or Fox Network pulling their collective heads from you-know-where."
4,"good special effects, good characters",I thought it was a good first show. There was a lot of tension and I felt like the show was very exciting. I liked the part when the guy was generating electricity with a stationery bike.
4,Pleasantly diverting light.,"The series finder is pleasantly diverting with a lighthearted humor. Withholding, some unfortunate diversions into off-color humor from time to time, the jokes and interactions are well constructed. Of especially interesting note is the interactions between Sherman the main character ""finder"" and his lawyer Leo. They have a kind of the Pinocchio and Jiminy cricket relationship only Pinocchio is incapable of lying or softening statements and Jiminy cricket is built like a Mack truck making for some interesting interactions. I recommend the series to get your mind off what's bothering you.Signed ?"
4,"Review of ""The Finder""",This is a fun show with interesting characters set on a remote Florida key. It has a good mix of humor and action. Very enjoyable.
5,I love this show!!!!!,"I found this show about 3/4 through the season. Bought it and watch it on my Kindle all my time. It's funny, romantic, and usually has a great life lesson. Geoff is like sooooooooo sexy. Very bummed they cancelled it for next season."
4,Not bad.,I really kinda like this show. It is a good adventure and fun to watch everything unfold. Good characters. Only can get better.
1,fine Unclassified,"This is in my opinion the book in which Tepper finds her rythm; distinctly superior to theearlier books in the True Game sequence.Adolescent female wizard grows up, in context of a Gaia-typeplanet in ecological decline. Fine to very fine."
3,Disappointing,"This T-shirt transfer looked like it would be good with very considerate clear markings which side was the non-printable side, a moderately difficult tearing and a reusable parchment paper to cover design when ironing. Unfortunately results, following instructions, were an image without any white, but rather greys and very muted colors. Not good.P.s: If it's worthwhile I might try again but with a professional heat press doing me the service. I don't particularly expect better results tho, considering I've seen this problem before with other dark T-shirt transfers."
1,Wrong directions!,Looking at the packaging it says to carefully read the directions enclosed. After following them exactly and printing up the sheets I realized that something was terribly wrong. The directions were for the light colored fabric kit. I printed mirror images of text which were now worthless. At least I did a test piece and didn't ruin my product. Get it together June Tailor.
4,A great tutorial,The video is a great tutorial for beginners. You will feel very comfortable and there is not stress on the body.
3,Very Gentle,Gentle Yoga for Every Body was not quite what I expected. Maybe a little too simple but may be good for beginners.
3,gentle...,"That is all, super gentle, even the harder stuff. Half of the workouts have you working with chairs... even n00bsauces would probably be experts at this video"
2,a big disappointment,"I was really disappointed in this book. I ordered it because it was recommended as a ""martial arts fiction"" book. However, the martial arts in this story play only a very small part. This book is mainly a mishmash of mystic mumbo-jumbo and a bisexual young man's attempt to find himself. I really wish I had known before purchasing it that the lead character would be a multi-sexual. I think everyone (whether they be straight, gay or a green alien from Mars) likes to read books that they can identify with...you know, put yourself in the lead character's shoes so to speak. I for one certainly could not identify with this book's main character."
1,"Really bad, boring module where nothing happens, and then, nothing happens","I bought a bunch of AD&D modules for low level. The Forest Oracle is the worst of the bunch. The plotline is thin. The writing is bad. This is a railroad that railroads the PC's to no-where. There are many ""encounters"" and ""rooms"" described with box-text where the description basically says 'You enter a room, there is a table, and nothing else'. If the players look around, nothing happens. If the players stop moving, nothing happens. If the players move on to the next room, they are being pushed down the railroad -- and when they get to the destination, nothing exciting or interesting happens there either. Eventually they come to a bridge where they must roll a saving throw, or fall off the bridge and die in a 200' chasm. When the most exciting plot event is a Save Or Die, for 1st level characters, that is very boring indeed."
4,Desired thermal at a decent price.,"I was looking for a calculator that used thermal paper rolls, so that I would not have to continue replacing the ribbon as I did in my old calculator. This calculator fit the bill. The directions with it weren't the clearest in the world, but with a little help from my husband, I was able to set the time and date. Everything else is pretty much like a standard calculator."
5,Great Deal On A Well Made Calculator,I can't believe I got this for under $30. I purchased the refurb and couldn't be happier. I am using this to do my taxes and I have always hated having to change out the ink ribbons in my old one. This is also very quiet and super quick.
1,Is this real?,"This film, which was made about 30 years ago, is being put out here as if the re-issuer is the director. The director is John Glenister. Also, the original run time is 90 minutes, and this issue states it is 75 minutes.Sounds a bit off, to me.The other issue on Amazon here, was issued in 2002.I have a copy of that one, and it is very poor quality, as a reviewer on that page has noted.As Bela Lugosi used to say, ""Bevare!!"""
2,Don't be fooled,"This picture has way to many characters in it. I really didn't find the fighting scenes very good to be honest. A ton of punches with very little kicks or other moves. A lot of fights,but most were very short and were over before you could really enjoy them. The weapon based battles were good,but not enough to carry the film. One of the weaker shaw brother film which is hard to understand with so many cool stars in it. The only person I really though did some cool moves was sun chien. I can't suggest buying this one to anybody. Buy five deadly venoms,crippled avengers,heaven and hell gate or two champions of shaolin over this."
4,Charming addition to patio,I bought these to place in pots on my patio and I am very pleased. The spray adjusts well to suit the pots. They are a nice alternative to the typical black sprinkler heads.
3,A book with two uses,"On the one hand, this book has some very nice new base classes, a few PrC's, and a scattering of spells & feats. For the roleplayer, this material is very nice- but a bit pricey.Added is a larger section on playing the new Miniatures small unit game. I haven't played that yet, so I can't give my opinion.If you're a roleplayer, and DO buy it, buy it here for the nice discount. Otherwise it is borderline too expensive."
2,A Book of Marginal Use,"Unless you play with miniatures frequently, this book will bring very little to the table. It contains some new, and I must say interesting, base classes, a few new spells, as well as a few feats that a GM would have to think long and hard about allowing into any game. The book also contains vast clarifications of the D&D movement rules, which can be helpful if you're a real stickler for having things adhere to the by-the-book rules.On the downside, there is the confusing introduction of the ""swift action"" which sometimes doesn't fit in well with the rest of the game."
5,This book is a must for all couples...,"This book, by far, is one of the most informative books I have ever read. It is a must for all couples, whether they have been married for years or are just planning to get married. It helped me understand the different personalities. From a christian stand-point, I finally see the light. Until I had read the book, I always thought my husband was the problem. Until I checked my own maturity level, did I realize that I had to stop placing the blame on others and be accountable for my own actions. Florence & Fred Littauer did an excellent job on this book. I give this book a golden 5 stars. God bless them both..."
1,It parodies itself,"A friend got a used copy as a joke pre-wedding gift. I'm buying it as a joke too. Problem is that its completely serious. Let's forget the myriad of typos in the book. Obviously nobody proof-read this puppy.This book, among other things, tells women that if their husband cheats that its her fault for not being perfect enough. A women's job is to shut up and service her husband in every way possible. Having opinions or being smarter than your husband is taboo... Even reading the bible yourself and forming your own opinion about it is a no-no.This is a great book as a joke, but it gets depressing to think that there are people out there who think like that..."
2,Very disappointing...,"I paid $50 for this after Thanksgiving because it was one thing on my son's Christmas list. When we opened the box, dumped it on the floor, then WHAM! I realized I had been took (for at least $30 of the $50). There is hardly anything to it. The box claims it contains 99 pieces; I don't know what they're counting here. Every single window, maybe, even though all this is attached in just a few pieces. It doesn't look nearly as good out of the box as it does on the box. This is definitely a take-back item. LEGOS ARE 10X BETTER!! Finally, I AM SOOO SICK OF THE TOY INDUSTRY ENTICING KIDS AND ADULTS IN ADS AND COMMERCIALS INTO PAYING BIG BUCKS FOR THEIR JUNK. HOW DO YOU GET GOOD TOYS NOWADAYS? IF ANYONE KNOWS, PLEASE LET EVERYONE IN ON THE BIG SECRET :-)"
5,Intensely Moving,"This series had a profound impact on me when I was a senior in high school. The women's liberation movement was ramping up to full force, and this series gave it more significance, as a means for social change. If aired today, it could do the same for viewers in this time who desire political and social equity for all people, even when they are different from ourselves. I would buy it, if they would make it available."
5,A definitive film-noir masterpiece becomes a dazzling DVD!,"If you want to define film-noir, OUT OF THE PAST has it all. Standout performances from Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas, magnificent direction by Jacques Tourneur, and a screenplay full of more twists than a super-pretzel.Warner Home Video has given this film an outstanding transfer, as good as, or even surpassing any presentation of a noir film on DVD hitherto.Oh yes, the FILM has GRAIN. It was shot that way. It's supposed to look that way. Pay no attention to dweebs on these boards who don't understand that. This DVD is sure to please any true film fan who knows what they're supposed to be looking at, and OUT OF THE PAST has never looked better!"
5,"Great Film, Excellent DVD","The film is top notch; so is the DVD transfer. The B+W image is solid and steady, generally with excellent detail, deep blacks, and crisp whites. This one looks great. Warners probably took a fresh print from the original RKO materials, which in this case must have come down to us in decent shape (the RKO library is problematic). Warner's hasn't sterilized the film by eliminating absolutely all grain and speckle, however. The minor artifacts that remain are probably on the negative--literally part of the film itself. Kudos to Warners for giving us so many great catalog films on DVD, and for taking the care to make films that are nearly old enough to collect Social Security look better today than they probably ever have before.Stephen R. Pendleton"
5,"""A dame with a rod is kinda like a fella with a knittin needle""","I'm not gonna tell you the whole story of this movie, read the other reviews if you want that. What I will tell you is that this is flat out an excellant movie! Robert Mitchum is at his best here droopy eyes and all. Kirk Douglas is also suberb, The acting, directing and the story are all top notch. But the main reason to see this movie is for the dialog witch is some of the best! Several of the many one liners have been quoted as the titles of many of these reviews. Bottom line if your a fan of the ""noir"" genre or of Robert Mitchum, or just a fan of really good movies you must see ""Out of the Past""! It does getb a little confusing towards the middle end but hey, nothing wrong with that it just gives you a reason to watch it again. Witch I think you will want to do!"
5,Film Noir at its Best,"When you hear the cliche, ""they don't make them like they used to"" this is one of those movies they refer to. Superb interchanges between Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum. Dialoge right out of those drug store pulp fiction novels, a movie that relies on plot, intreigue and innuendo rather than special effects. The script writers got it just right and the actors deliver the lines perfectly. Even if you can see the plot or twists, it is still fun to watch how well the actors pull it off.This is such a classic, new film buffs and those who grew up with B&W; movies will all appreciate this movie.Just as a FYI - They did a remake many years later with Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges ""Against All Odds"". Same plot, bit racier of course since the standards have changed. That was good as well, but not quite up to the orginal."
4,A Twist of Fate,"Having read many books by this author, I was impressed how different the style of this book was when compared to her other novels. Including the other two that complete this triology. Genies, spells, enchanted palaces...quite a different venue than I am used to reading but very enjoyable. The story is complete, no loose ends left at the end and it truly brings a conclusion to the other books in the triology, yet you do not have to read them to get the gist of the story. Claire Delacroix will always be one of my favorite romance authors!!"
1,Love it,I throughly enjoy this workbook. Every sponsor/sponsee should have one. I can totally relate to the way the author is talking to me about any one of our problems.
5,A wonderful book for sponsors in any 12 Step program,"This book is very useful and easy to understand. It's very helpful and has documented years of success in sponsoring other who are in recovery. THe author shares his ""experience, strength and hope"" in this practical guide to working the 12 Steps. It's adaptable to any 12 Step program. I use it often and continue to find answers to questions as a re-read and study the contents."
4,Sponsorship made easier,I really liked this book and would recommend it for anyone who is or is considering sponsoring a person in the Twelve steps. Many great Q&A's plus each step is broken down with qualifying questions to help you and your sponsee. A must read for anyone wanting to give their best to carry the message.
3,"Really good for those who are super 12-steppers, not so much for others.","I enjoyed much of this book. However, not everyone would agree that the primary (or perhaps only) responsibility of a sponsor is to take the sponsoree through the steps. For those who believe a sponsor might also be a friend, a cheerleader, a listener, etc, this book isn't so great."
5,GOOD SPONSORSHIP BOOK,HAS ALOT OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS YOU MIGHT NEED IF YOU ARE IN A 12 STEP PROGRAM. THE SERVICE IS WAS VERY QUICK AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE!
3,Read like a brochure,"I like the book. It appears to have good sound advise. I am disappointed with all the filler in the book, sometimes it is difficult to get to the point of the subject with all the reviews, commentaries and promotional information for this or that machine that has Sprint 8 build into program, getting in the way. If you look at the editors review, those types of comments are directly in the book. To me that is noise. I pulled out my trusty highlighter just to distill it down for later reread. I think the message is good but I may have got the same message from his blogs. I will follow his advise because I believe that he is spot on. The plan & worksheets he has in the back will help. I understand where he was going with all this extra information, but really didn't need all the power selling on his program."
4,Next step of Body-for-life,Great information. I have used Body-for-life for several years. This book uses research to explain the science and goes further to specify sound approaches. Main enhancements for me were the understanding of fast twitch muscles and how to excercise them for even greater overall fitness results - And natural production of HGH.
2,To Learn the Sprint 8 Program this could have been a 2 page book,"If you were looking for detailed instructions on the Sprint 8 program this book could have been 2 pages. The content is fine but not original in any way and the number of times the author reiterates the Sprint 8 program gets old really fast. So if you are buying the book to learn the Sprint 8 program you don't need this book as it has been detailed on the author's website and many other websites. If you know nothing about exercise and want to learn how to exercise (lift weights, eat better etc.,) this may be a good book for you (very dated though)."
1,Didn't have what I wanted,"Based on what I read about the book, I thought I would be getting a detailed explanation and ""user guide"" for incorporating sprint work into my workouts. But there wasn't much there that I didn't already know. Far too many useless photos, too."
1,Spend your money on anything else,"This cd sucks. Christian music is so dead. Music in general is dead. The only cd that has excited me recently in Christian music is Living Sacrifice - Reborn and Hammering Process. I would also like to add 77's - Pray Naked. you might also try Soul Embraced and some Star Flyer 59 - any of em :)If you wanna go secular I recomend the following- Sepultura - Nation, Belle & Sebastian - Fold your hands and walk like a peasent, Portishead -dummy, Iced Earth - Dark Saga. That broad enough in styles for ya to show ya I am not biased and know all styles of music?Wake up WORLD, wake up church!"
1,a month and a half later...no movie no refund.,I placed an order on 1/06/11 and I still have not received the item. I emailed this user and not only had he completely ignored me but had not given me the refund I have requested for. Do not purchase from this user.
3,A glaring historical gaffe!,"The Templar story is riveting and the talking heads are very good, but the piece itself is really pretty shoddy. A truly glaring gaffe is their repeatedly showing a portrait of a man they repeatedly say is the 14th century French King Philippe le Bel -- and he nothing of the sort. The portrait is Velasquez' portrait of the 17th century Spanish King Philip IV. (Check Google images and you'll see him for yourself.) I.e., wrong country, wrong century, wrong man. The show was clearly done on the cheap which is really a shame since the Templar story is so riveting. However, the History Channel's clearly shoddy research will make me very unwilling to buy another of their DVDs."
5,Who does not like the Templar mystery!,I am all about the Templars! Even have their shield and mask in my collection. This video is superb. Thanks History channel!
2,Disappointed 2,Against my better judgement I ignored the reviews and purchased this game. It turns out most folks were right. While I didn't have any problems installing the game it takes several minutes to load up and get flying each time. I've never heard my hard drive crunch so much as it does while this is running!I bought the logitech joystick but if I had it to do over again I would have gotten the Xbox 360 controller for Windows (much less bulky).I'm a real Cessna pilot and I don't find the flight characteristics to be realistic but then again it is a game!
3,Very Disappointed,"Like many other reviewers, I have a brand new (only 2 months old) PC with dual core processors, 2GB RAM, 256MB NVIDIA video card, etc. etc. which easily exceeds the system requirements published on the software. I installed the game and was very disappointed at how poor it ran. I also have FS2004, which runs extremelyl well, vs the sick and sad performance of FSX10. If you share these sentiments, please write a review and hopefully Microsoft will address this problem, since only .001% of the population will have a PC which can be suitable for this game."
1,Disappointed,"My computer meets or exceeds the requirements advertised by Microsoft for this game to function. However, it barely functions at all. With detail controls set to minimum in settings, the game still is very slow and intermittent in the refresh rate. Flight Sim 2004 worked much better in my system.Several other friends are having the same problem, so I see this game as not a very good show for Microsoft."
3,Flight Sim X review,"This is a fun game with SO MUCH detail. In fact, the game has so much realism and high res graphics that is is VERY SLOW to run on a WINDOWS XP machine older than 2009. The game is slow and the frame rate is poor even on the lowest settings. Make sure you have a very high end video card and an extremely fast processor or you will not enjoy the game. Microsoft set their minimum requirements too low in my opinion. FS2004 or even FS2002 are so much better if you have an older computer."
3,A Letter to Microsoft,"Dear MS,If you can get the crash dynamics right this game would resurrect the Nazis...which is good.Love,Ben"
4,"Good game...just make sure you have windows 7, good CPU, good video card.","Well this game rocks if you have the above stats.Here's the breakdown:Pro's:AWESOME graphicsWide variety of planesEasy to learn how to doCon'sIf you don't have windows 7 it won't let you register the game which means you play 30 min. and it cuts out.You NEED at least a core i3,512mb video card, and 2gb RAM. (I tried playing it on my P4.)"
1,2 years before its time,"This product is a hog. Unbelivable that Microsoft would release a product like this. Seems like it's designed to make you upgrade to a new computer and Vista. Even if you meet the ""minimum requirements"", the program takes an incredible amount of time to load and you can't use settings that take advantage of the graphics potential. I had a fairly new XP system, but had to get a new high speed hard disk drive and DVD drive to try to use this hog, and still was dissatisfied. My son was intrigued at first, but dropped it quick to go back to his PlayStation. Read the other reviews...I recommend you avoid this and use older versions like they say. This product is a ripoff."
4,"Great simulator, but you'd better have GREAT hardware","Loads of fun and amazingly realistic IF....you have the hardware. I have a core 2 duo 2.14MHZ, a 7900 graphics card with 512mb of memory, 2GB of 800mhz memory, a fairy high-end motherboard and this simulator runs fairly well. It still can't run at highest settings without slowing down to an unusable crawl, so don't even bother to order it if you have anything less than the above. This is the ONLY application that ever made me feel my computer was seriously underpowered. But I don't play high-end games, either, I'm sure if I did I'd have the same experience.So if you have the stuff, go for it. It's great."
1,Another Non Installed Flight Sim - Catch 22 Microsoft V. 3.0,"Well Maybe I should run around the living room Flapping my Arms and saying Zoooom like i did when i was a kid...Bought it, tried to load it, hit the catch 22...You can't load disc 2 because you are using dvd software that writes dvd's however you can't load it without dvd software. Spoke With Microsoft in Mumbi for about an hour and he could't figure it out so he sends me new disc's but they don't work cause of the software conflict. So you unload the DVD software and the thing says ""Hey, I won't run without dvd software"". Big duel core computer with 2gig memory etc. I will figure this out eventually or returm my purchase to Amazon. Then I will try to use the Microsoft Money software."
4,"Flight SIM , provides fun for all ages.","Although Flight simulation does not seem to be suitable for young kids , Microsoft Flight Simulator X stands out in its scalability and suitability for all family members. My 6 years old son loves it too , it is easy for him to progress through the lessons and learn a new skill from each one.The graphics and the audio sounds are excellent , there are many expansion packs available in the market to add more Aircrafts or Airports. Overall it is a very good game and excellent value for money. This is one of the few times that Microsoft gets it absolutely right."
1,No longer supported by Microsoft,The program is very out dated and no longer supported by Microsoft. It is becoming more difficult to update through third party developers and you almost need to be at a programming level to make changes. I really hope a more innovative company steps forward to create an experience that is as real as it gets. Not to mention it doesn't run well in MS Windows 7.
5,"Great Game, Runs fine as well.","Okay, I would first like to adress the shooting down of FSX as it is only on DVD-ROM. This is because the HUGE 14 gigs of information would need about 12 CD-ROMs AT LEAST.anyway, there is nothing wrong with this game power wise. I have a computer that is 2 years old and FSX Runs great at 1152X864 resolution with all eyecandy at maximum.Bottom Line: Great game, Great performance."
3,I hope Microsoft developed this sim for future systems...,"I read a review in PC Gamer saying that this game was released a year too soon. And I have to tell you, they were right on the money. I have what I consider a mid-level gamer's rig (3.2 Ghz processor, 256 MB graphics card, and 1 gig of RAM), and still I receive graphic ""glitches"" when I run this game. Beware: If you just meet the system requirements to run this sim, be prepare to turn all the graphical ""goodies"" off. From what I've seen, this sim is a system hog. On the plus side, I'm impressed with the sheer number of airports available. And the real-time weather feature seems like a nice touch. Lets hope when I upgrade my graphics card, ram, and my OS to Vista, this game shows its true potential."
4,"OK, but CAUTION: DVD ONLY","Note that this comes on 2 DVDs, not on CD-ROMs as the tech details say. If you do not have a DVD reader in your machine you will not be able to install this game. As a side note, it also has Microsoft's ""registration"" copy protection just like Windows XP."
1,Product Key registration Insanity,"After installation, taking about 30 minutes, MSFS X Deluxe Edition started and asked for product key.The Product Key that is printed on a bright yellow tag is easy to find and to read.The product key was not recoginzed after at least 10 attempts to enter the Product Key:THEN after attempting to uninstall, errors occured and now it will not repair, uninstall, or install.I did get to run it in trial mode the first time with all settings to maximum and it looks very good, but for all the insanity with the completely malfuntioning registration process and poor support I'd rather use X-Plane 8."
2,GOOD LUCK ON GRAPHICS,"I purchased Micro. Flight Sim X with great expectaions of improvements from the 2004 version. Install was flawless, other than activation. I was VERY disappointed at the performance. Im not sure what kind of system is needed to play this game with decent graphics, but I can't find one. I have 2 high powered machines (Intel D core, 2GB Ram, PCIExp 256MB video). I can currently play pretty much any game on the market with no problems and good performance with decent frames rate. THIS SIM is BAD. I had to jack down all the settings to make it perform even so-so. Flight graphics very choppy and sluggish. Turning performance settings WAY down helps, but does not completly cure the issues. I installed it on a gamer friends system, with the same results. He actually has a very expensive video card, with same results. Both of our systems WELL EXCEED requirements for the SIM. Buyer Beware.."
3,"Fun Game, but BEWARE you need at least 15GB of memory.",This game is a lot of fun with good graphics but beware you need at least 15GB of memory for the game to work other wise you have wasted your money.
3,So So,"I just got this for Christmas and I was all hyped up about the new Flight Simulator. FS 2004 is awesome and works fine, but FS X does not have the good detailed cockpit like in FS-04. It also says it is in ""safe mode."" Every time I try to run it, it keeps asking me for the product key. It also wants to work online to use the game.Flight Simulator 2004 was better."
1,very bad,"This is the 4th edition of Flight Sim I've owned, and this one is by far the worst. After hours of messing with it I was able to get it loaded, but it runs very slow and is over all terrible. You'd think microsoft would have made significant improvments but they failed on this one. Makes me not want to even buy microsoft products anymore. Do not waste your money or take your chances on this game."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER ONES. DOES NOT WORK WELL. NEEDS MORE WORK. WOULD NOT BUY.
2,hmmm,Unfortunately I do not have yoke or pedals and no number pad to work some of the features. Using F3 and F4 ect. for speed doesn't make the game a great deal of fun unless you like crashing and burning and not finishing any missions. The package arrived great and timely and in great condition. But alas the lack of extras... well is self defeating.
1,RIPOFF,this game sucks for real it never installs in my computer. my computer is only 2 weeks old. this games sucks for real don't buy it i returned it and boght a new game.this is a ripoff
3,Buyer beware,"Like most avid sim fans. I eagerly awaited this release. Strong word of caution. My own stupidity for not realizing this, but this game is not available in CD-ROM. So if you pc does not have a DVD drive, you are out of luck. I purchased mine at Walmart, because the description on what was required stated CD-ROM drive. Sure the box clearly states DVD, and I should have caught that, but I just could not bring myself to think that the genuises at Microsoft assumed everyone has a DVD drive in their pc right. Anyway, the catch 22 is that once you open the software, the retailer will not take it back, so your are stuck with a useless $50.00 game you can not use. To be fair, I did finally find a number at Microsoft to call for product returns and got an authorization to return it and in about a month I might get my money back. Buyer beware, don't be as dumb as me. If you only have a CD drive, you are out of luck on this game, Microsoft don't think you are worth their trouble."
1,CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION,"do not buy this product unless you have a super powerful computer.. I have an average pc and the program ran but it was very slow. Took 2 hours to install and about 10 minutes to load each game.. I played it for about an hour then uninstalled it and threw the whole game in the trash.. What a complete waste of time and money.. I think there should be an option to install fewer cites, i am only interested in the US, but still have to install the entire world.. very very very disappointed."
4,my choice,i gave it an overall 4 star because my laptop had critical battery so i couldnt fly because i discharged fast and i needed more space.
3,Too many small mistakes,"This game is too flawed, first of all I have a AMD turion X2 3 ghz and a more than 75 gbs of hard drive, and over 4gb of ram. So it far exceeds minimum requiresments by light years, but at max settings it s=gets about 10 frames a second, which is good, but there are other problems, the installation takes a hell of a long time, and it either corrupts or unistalls itself after the first play, so you have to put it in the cd drive and install it again. It's a decent game."
3,Not too bad,"Its not too bad, glitch Here glitch there, bad part is it requires a massive amount of power to run. i do OK with it at 1200x1600 about 50% stats graphics."
1,"Product registration is difficult, impossible, maddening","MS costumer service, deplorable. I have been tiring to register for days .I get ""server busy"". Not worth the hassle."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"Microsoft, the supposed master of software, cannot design a game that will install on modern systems with DVD burning capabilities and movie making programs?!?!?!?! Will not install. Additionally, system requirements to really play the game are off the charts... I'm really supposed to spend thousands on the newest hardware (and lots of it) and then use the computer solely for this program only!? You've got to be kidding! Microsoft laid a very big egg on this one. Do not buy!"
1,Rate what?,"How we can rate a service or product that is not currently available and or has not yet been released?Are you people high or what? The show was great. The DVD?

5,Great Series NBC was dumb to cancel. ESPN your a genius!!,"I had so many friends and co-workers talk about how much they enjoyed watching the Contender TV series, the ratings were not accurate from people I talk to. But most people don't have rating's boxes in there homes.Bottom line this a great TV series and I hope it comes to DVD soon!!"
5,EXCELENTE!!!,"HEY THIS IS NORBERTO FROM MEXICO...

IM IN FAVOR OF THE QUALITY AND ORIGINAL DVD'S SO I HOPE THE CONTENDER DVD'S COME OUT SOON, I MEAN VERY VERY SOON, CANT WAIT TO HAVE THIS. !!!!"
3,ctk,"Dreamy, quiet electronic-ish light rock. Just about every song on this album is filled with a delicate arrangement and hushed vocals that will make you either a) want to immediately curl up in a ball and drift off to sleep or, b) bore you to death, thus leading you to, yet again, want to fall asleep. Most of the songs sound similar and aren't very distinct from one another, there just isn't much variety found in this album."
2,Faint clues,"2 1/2Scattershot glitch-tronica on top of hushed, DFC-like presentation adds up to little more than muddled intrigue."
5,Great book about the truth!,"An amazing book for anyone, especially eye opening for those who are unfamiliar with the Palestinian struggle. It is a clear picture of the remarkable struggles the Palestinian people have had to endure under occupation. It is incredibly painful to read some of the harsh brutality the Palestinians have had to live through, but extremely accurate. I applaud Hanan's efforts in writing a book that must have dredged up so many painful memories. Highly recommend it!"
1,THIS SIDE OF PEACE,"I was hoping to really get something out of this book. I have studied the Middle East and the Arab/Israel conflict for 20 years. About a third of the way into it, I realized that I was reading a hard-cover edition of ...I understand that Ms. Ashrawi has a position to support. But as I read, I began to recall a quote attributed to Paul Revere about one of his associates. Following this associate giving a speech, Paul Revere said, ""The more he proclaimed his honor, the faster we counted our spoons."" In this case, the more Ms. Ashrawi proclaims the divine right of Arabs to land they lost in a war they started, the less credible I found her argument.Again, I was really hoping for something good here - unfortunately, this book was a major disappointment."
5,Review from Biologist,"""I cannot speak too highly of this book- the overall standard of presentation and production is excellent. It should be on the reading list of all university biology and environmental science courses, since it is the products of such courses who must deal with the major challenge facing our own species in the next 50 years: the sensible stewardship of the remaining forests. It also merits a place in school libraries, and will serve to provide a wealth of information to the concerned later day reader who seeks accesible, up-to-date information on the complexities of forest conservation.""-reviewed by Barry Meatyard"
2,curious journal,I found here a curious journal of personal thoughts and queries of someone searching their being; as if jotting down experiential flashes in an attempt to express oneself and be known.
4,A Charming Read,This book features a wonderful collection of prose and poetry from the inner crevices of Carolkay's mind. It's the way she puts words and art together that draws in the reader and sends them on their own journey.I recommend curling up with this book on a quiet summer's eve or cool wintery night when you're all alone and eager to be inspired and entertained. ...
5,This book is a must-have!,"I can't image that any bookshelf would be complete without this book on it. Jigna Desai is astute and clever, and her writing is both complex and accessible. It is clear that she is an expert on Bollywood, and her critical perspectives left me wanting more. This is a great book!!!"
5,i love the song,i was young one time and played with barbies and i just love the song. it's great to dance to. i think everyone who played with barbies should like this song.
4,very danceable,"I guess if you read to much into this cd then I guess it could be questionable, but my daughter loved dancing to it before she was even 2! Now she's almost 3 and I'm going to get the single. She dosen't understand all the words and it's over her head anyway. I think it's a cute song."
1,Disappointing,"When my son got this toy, we snapped the tentacle into the back, and it broke almost immediately. I called the company, and they said that they can do nothing. I was told I could return it to the store for an even exchange, but that presupposes that anybody has it in stock. I can now either let my son play with a broken toy, or not have it at all.I don't have confidence that he could flex the other ""articulated"" tentacles without them breaking too. If you want a toy that can sit on a shelf and be stared at, perhaps this is the toy for you. Otherwise, I would stay away from it."
4,ock is in the house!!!!!!!!,hi I`m 12 years old. my nickname is COLLECTION REAPER.this dock ock figure is the best made looking one I`VE seen so far. and overall I`M lookin forward to have him in my collection ...!
1,Would be nice if we could buy the damn thing!!!!!!!,My son and I are tired of tring to buy this damn toy. I feel if you make these toys you should make alot of them. So parents like me dont get mad. If you plan to make toys be Santa Claus and make enough for everyone!
4,Tentacles questionable - rest of toy great!,"I've seen several reviews that say the tentacles sometimes fall out. The tentacles hold just fine, but you have to pop them all the way in, which is not intuitive. You have to pop in not only the ball but also the shape behind the ball (rectangle-ish shape for the lower tentacles and baseball-diamond shape for the upper tentacles).I'm still figuring out whether the tentacles can truly be posed or not. They do feel as if they might break if I try too hard. So my one complaint about this toy is that the tentacles aren't well articulated. It seems like it would have been so easy for Toy Biz to make them out of a better material. Oh, well."
2,Don't believe the hype,My name is Chase and I just finished a half-hour crying session because I was so disappointed with my new Doc Ock action figure. (...). This figure can not be posed other than moving his arms and legs. He can't even stand up because of the weight of the tentacles. Lower your expectations on this one and you might enjoy it.
1,i don' t like it,"i was really excited to play with my new doctor octopus toy, but when i got it, i didn't like it. the tentacles were very hard to put in and once you got them in they wouldn't stay in. on the picture they show that the tentacles are posable, but they are not. you can't even get him to stand up becase the tentacles weigh him down."
3,"Cool, But, Frustrating","This is a very stout, and highly articulated rotocast figure. Much better than the 2 Spiderman and the 1st movies Green Goblin. (...), it's really great.It is short packed; but, not all that uncommon. I found 3 in 4 cases. There's only 3 figures to a case, however.The tentacles are very difficult to get in. The instructions are not the best, so, that adds to the frustration. I have my Doc Ock standing on it's own. It's all in how you pose the tentacles. I have them holding the figure up. (Have the tentacles behind Doc and it'll stand). Becareful bending the tentacles, they are somewhat fragile. I was worried I would break mine. But, they did survive.+ side: Solid figure. Heavy. Looks better than the actor.- side: Difficult getting the tentacles on. Tentacles feel fragile. Poor assembly instructions.Score 89% B+"
3,Super Reader,"Something John Taylor says sums this book up pretty well:""..we have a biblical myth to kill.""It is war between John and his mother Lilith, with various Nightside residents from the future, those that have been trying to kill him for so long to stop this war from destroying most of everything, taking part.Everybody is involved, and even the Authorities are exposed to the violence, as John makes a desperate run to Shadows Fall for a weapon that may give him a chance, with his friends running sacrificial inteference.Lilith, the architect of the Nightside to give herself a haven from the powers of Heaven and Hell will not go easily, and they may even need another plan.This book is a lot more Deathstalker than private investigator, with super powered beings, monsters, gods, zombies, and everything else being blasted, mastered and b*stard all over the Nightside and the timeline."
2,Still just scholck,"I know, why do you read these things just to put them down?Well, like John Taylor says every 3 pages, I live in hope. This work is no worse or better than the others before it. Its still too melodramatic and overblown. The characters are still so flat I do not care what happened to them and the plot is still pretty simplistic.That said, the book is actually quite....oh it still is only fair. Look read the book if you read the others, because you might as well but don't expect anything better than before and that is a dirty shame.I will say this: EE Dock smith would have done this better."
1,Wishing I could give it zero stars,"This barely readable book is not worth my time. If a high school student had produced this work, I would have commended his or her creative thinking while insisting that the student develop some basic writing skills. I also would have suggested the student ask someone to proofread his or her work before turning it in. As for what to do with my copy of SB: 1 or God, I can't decide whether to give it away or throw it away."
1,Did I read the same book?,"I found this book to be so badly written that whatever imaginative message it has gets lost. The author relies heavily on dialogue to impart information. Most writers do this from time to time to advance the story, but Maddox uses it almost exclusively. Worse, the dialogue is unnatural and repetitious. I'd like to know the word counts for ""Mark"" and ""Eddie"" since he has each of his main two characters calling the other by name in nearly every sentence. In addition, the author has a problem with grammar, and I often found it difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He often uses adjectives as nouns and sometimes drops prepositions. Did he have an editor?"
1,I hope you like dialogue,"All of the analysis in these other critiques is quite profound, and the philosophical thesis of this book is certainly interesting. I am surprised, however, that few others feel as I do: this text is unreadable. The whole freaking thing is dialogue. Rather than write ""they decided to go to the store"", Maddox writes ""'Hey, wanna go to the store'...'Sure, let's go""...'okay'"". Maybe this style is considered cutting edge and left-of-mainstream presentation in some circles, or maybe I got a gag version of this book that no one else has, but I really struggled to get through this story."
2,A Grade C Movie in Book Form,"I won't bother reiterating what has been said about the book in other reviews. I bought the book based on many of them. The problem I have is not the ideas, they are quite interesting. The problem is in the execution. This book is so crudely written that I had to put it down. If Mr. Maddox could write he might actually create a very good novel, but this is klutzy to an extreme. I was simultaneously reading David McCullough's biography of John Adams and was struck by the elegance of his writing compared to Karl Mark Maddox's. But read the other reviews and take your choice, it is only money and time."
1,Unreadable!,"After reading the reviews on this site, I thought that this would help me to examine all of my thoughts and beliefs. Other reviewers have said that this is a wonderful book for all intelligent and open-minded people. I decided to splurge and buy this book new, certain that it would be well worth the price.However, the writing is so horrible that I couldn't get past the first few pages. For all I know, it is as good as everybody says, but I didn't want to waste my time wading through badly written prose in the hopes of finding something meaningful. Maybe I'll pick it up again someday, when I have nothing else to read (which won't be anytime soon). Until then, it will just collect dust on my bookshelf."
2,at war with itself,"We bought this book on the strength of its reviews. My husbond says its one of the poorest attempts to rip-off a certain old T.V. show he's ever seen. I happen to like that old show and feel SB: 1 or God is a good story, but not-so-well written. The story line seems at war with itself. .it wants to be good but someone won't let it. There is a force working aginst the flow of it. It's not like other books I have read, there is something different about this author's English usage. I don't mean that in a snobbish way, it's jerky or irregular or something like that."
1,Can I give it zero stars,"One of the worst books I've ever tried to read -- and I'm an avid reader of science fiction (which is the gendre the author puts this books into) as well as alternative history, futurism and religion. But this is simply atrocious. I'm sorry that the 5-star reviewers haven't read anything more inspiring than this overwrought diatribe. Besides the annoyingly quirky syntax and stilted dialog, it's filled with such laughably innane concepts such as 'the city of God's people' which has streets paved with pure gold and gates incrusted with precious jewels. Please -- just a little creativity would have been refreshing. I can't even get into the trite and unimaginative construct he calls the 'blue spot'. I was hoping for a great read based on all these reviews but this isn't even a 1-star book. Don't get me wrong, the author's message is a good one -- but we've heard it all before -- many, many times in many (better) ways."
2,Over rated,"After reading the other reviews I ordered a copy of the book. I dont see what the hoopla was all about. As far as science fiction goes, it was amaturish. As philosophy the idea's put forth are nothing new, and the dialog was tedious. I also found ch.7 to be offensively anti-semetic and hostile towards the judeo-christian tradition (maybee I'm overly sensitive). If your a 14 year old athiest, you might like it, but dont waste your time otherwise."
3,Semi pleased,"I don't believe this author put total potential into this, it is a very good theme, just hurried. The book could be much better if it was re-visited, matter as a fact this would be a super read if it were dolled up, it does have a very good premise. As I was reading it, I agreed all the way, but it just was put together to quickly like he had something else to do. If you want to know what possibilites await us in the near future read this, but if your into good grammer and colorful style , stay far away. I did come away with more than I went into it though, and that says alot concerning what books to read."
3,Missing drivers,"It seems to work, but if you are using Win2000 check if you have the ""nehcd.sys"", ""nusb2hub.sys"" and the ""nusbd.sys"" drivers (probably in your ""c:\winnt\system32\drivers\"" directory). You will need them, but they do not come with the product."
3,Interesting Capo,"I bought this capo for two very specific reasons. One, it's cheep and two, it looks kinda cool. That being said, it wasn't quite as practical as I initially hoped. The major drawback with this little number is it cant be quickly removed. With some necks it not a real problem; you can just slide it back behind the nut. However with others this will be fairly problematic. If your play entire songs with the capo on then this will work fine (if not look elsewhere). Now having said that, the ability to tighten and loosen, as well as selecting how your string will be pushed is pretty nifty.So if you don't want to move the capo allot and like it's barring selection. I would defiantly suggest this to you."
3,Depends on WHO you are....,Great book for the uninitiated who are listening to the Who album by album for the first time. Skip this one if you're already in the know.
1,this cd is soooooooo stupid,i dont reccomend this cd. it is a piece of trash like flavas and my scene dolls!(not to mention brittany spears cd's)she sounds like shes got a cold!
1,is this a money-making gimmick or what?,"Our physics department decided to switch to this book last year, and I have been trying to figure out which edition to buy.. ""extended enhanced problem edition"", ""extended"", ""enhanced""? How about throwing in a student's companion text that contains ""chapter extensions?""? What about getting the right Solutions manual? only 30% of the solutions are in it? And now I just found out they have published (another?) new 7th edition which no doubt will have a brand new array of essential supplements and extensions. Why all these editions and supplements?"
2,I ordered it a week and a half ago and still have no book.,I ordered it a week and a half ago and still have no book.
3,Ultimate Codes for Gran Turismo 4,"I believe there are two versions of this cheat code disc. To the best of my knowledge, one box is printed in black and white ink, the other box in color ink. I also believe that the codes these two discs contain are different, which allows the gamer to open different cars and etc. The Ultimate Codes I bought recently was advertized with the colored box. I received the box with the black and white only ink. Let the purchaser be aware that they may not receive the version they think they are ordering."
5,lots of action and keeps your attention.,This is a real life story of Joel Russell . Once you start to read it you don't want to stop until you finish the book. It keeks you intertained from start to finish.
2,Greatly Disappointed,"Casio used to be a trustworthy quality brand name for small electronics. This product does meet the basic published specifications. However, the ""details"" should cause the potential buyer to look at some other product. To date, the key functions have been found to be counter-intuitive by five different people. The User Manual is worse than terrible. The support telephone number leads you into a maize that ends with a request for a chargeable credit card. No on-line support for this model could be found at the Casio web site. And the crowning detail is that the printer output lines cannot be read until about five ""lines"" after each line is printed. The only good feature of this calculator is the ease of paper loading. This is a good feature because you will be probably be using about 4 times as much paper than with any other printing calculator."
3,Waiting for help from seller.,"I am waiting on an email from seller on how to set the time. I agree with other buyers that the manual telling you how to operate the calculator is less than informative. After following the poor instructions many times, I gave up on setting the time which leaves me wondering if it really works or if I should send it back. I like some things about it-the paper roll does not continually fall off like my last small Casio- It is quiet. But I paid for it and I want it to do what it is advertised to do. Not too much to ask? I guess I will send it back if I don't get detailed instructions that I can use. This is the bad part of ordering online. If I get help and it works then I may change my rating. M"
1,Barely Adequate,"This product is made from very low grade particle board and compressed paper. Of all self-assemble furniture ever purchased, this is the worst. The base holes in the outer panels are over size and do not grip the screws.The back looks very cheezy with the seam down the middle. The under side of the top is unfinished.If this cost $50 and was made in China, it would be a decent value. As a Canadian, I'm ashamed of the product.Assembly is easy."
4,Serves our purpose,I bought this unit for DVD storage. There is plenty of room for us and fits well in our family room. It is what you would expect of a unit you have to assemble yourself. My daughter and I put it together so it's not that difficult.
2,DVD RACK,"THIS IS A GOOD RACK. BUT, IF YOU JUST WANT IT FOR DVDS, THEN IT IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU. THIS RACK DOES NOT FIT DVDS EQUALLY."
5,AWESOME!!,"These CDs take me back 15 years to best years of my adolescence. Since turntables are almost obsolete (unless you're a DJ), the disks are great. For those who aren't bilingual, this is a great opportunity to start learning Spanish."
1,awful kit,"This is the worst experience I have had coloring eggs for easter ever. The tabs did not dissolve. The colors except for green were useless and weak. We are still wondering why we switched from Paas. The stickers were terrible and near impossible to use. Overall NO GOOD. John Fornuto 107 Lewis Road, Northport, NY 11768 (...)"
2,Good Start,"This is a good place to begin, if you're interested in beginning levels of shamanic journeying. If you are interested in real shamanic practices that include a combination of varying cultures and initiations you can feel, even from a distance, go to, [...]. They give you the inner tools to awaken to the shamanic path."
4,Spiritual growth potential,Very interesting & enlighting book that teaches reconnecting to nature & animals and healing. Opens new possibilities and new ways of viewing the world & your relationship with it.
5,Want to understand the basics of shamanism? Read this book.,I have read many books on the subject of shamanism and have been very dissapointed...until now.Michael Harner provides the clearest explanation I have been able to find about what shamanism IS without loading the reader down with vague New Age references and ego stroking. Expectionally clean presentation of information on a very weighty subject.
1,don't be fooled,"I'm a bit upset by the number of people who have been fooled by this book. I can say this because I am Native American, and 'Shamanism' has always been in my family. This author has stolen our traditions, took them as his own, warped them, and is now attempting profit. I would have given this book a lower rating if it were possible. Please don't look to him as an authority on this subject. He doesn't even always focus on the important aspects of 'Shamanism' anyway, he kind of gets caught up in his own ideals of it.For those of you who're sincerely interested in this subject, just look inside yourself. Realize there is no 'imagination', pay attention to what you feel, and knowledge will come. If you Really want a book on it, try a book written by Natives, such as ""Medicine of the Cherokee"" by Garrett.Hey, you wouldn't go to a Russian to learn about South American beliefs, or an Australian to learn about Canadian beliefs, would you?"
5,Great book,This is a great introduction to the core of shamanism. It is a must read book for anybody who seriously wants to udertake the path of the shaman.
5,Honest approach to the journey process,"I appreciate Harner's approach because he does not diminish the varied ways of doing shamanistic travel. This book is the starting place for his techniques which primarily rely on drums or rattles. It is an easy to follow book with a very applicable and straightforward technique. A 10 year old could do it.If the book works for you, you can contact the foundation that Harner has and find local groups or techers to build on what the book teaches."
3,Call back,"While I truly appreciate the information and insight Harner has brought to the west, his writing is amazingly academic and cerebral. I hesitate to recommend this book because Harner stepped on a lot of cultural toes to present something he calls ""cultureless,"" something that's not even possible. Despite that assertion, the cosmology presented in his core shamanism is very Abrahamic and most definitely culturally influenced. For an academic understanding of shamanism, this is a good primer. To learn *why* shamanism, absorb every page. If you are seeking an experiential glimpse of shamanism or a more instructional text, this book is not it. If you want insight into the many cultures of shamanism or the understanding of how we are all hardwired to experience awe, read the work of Karen Vogel, Roma Morris, and Robert Wallis."
2,Harnerism not Shamanism,"This book is commercialized shamanism. Although interesting and well written it is one of the many tools Harner has used to make a name for himself at the expense of others. He has studied different forms of Shamanism extensively, but he takes their ""core"" and fits it into a nice neat package with an artistic cover. Taking Shamanism out of context is degrading to the cultures for whom Shamanism is an integral part of their life. Harner has taken the opportunity to put someone elses spirituality up for sale. I suggest readers of this book to read Paul C. Johnson's article ""Shamanism from Ecuador to Chicago: A Case Study in New Age Ritual Appropriation."" It can be found in the journal Religion (April 1995)."
1,"Thanks, Michael--Not.","Here it is, the little book that started the big (and profitable) idea that ""shamanism"" is an open-to-all, homogenous ""religion"" you can join just as you might join a Christian church. It isn't, and you can't. To belong to the modern, majority US/Western culture and claim to be a ""shaman"" is as ridiculous as claiming to be a 21st century knight. If lying on your bed listening to a drumming tape or shelling out several hundred bucks to attend a workshop makes you a shaman, then watching Yentl makes you a rabbi. Believe what you want to believe, but sue me if I don't come to any of your healing ceremonies (or brises). Anyone who really wants to study Native ways out of admiration for them will research what Native people the world over have to say about ""shamanism"" (and I mean the majority, not just the ones who want your money). If you really have any respect, doing this research will make you change your mind."
1,Was not enlightening,Michael Harner expresses some mystical concepts in the tradition of shamanism except he misses the sybolism and takes it all too literally. Rather disburbing book.
2,Does Not Support Windows XP!,"I bought this switch to share a printer between 2 printers. This product is waaay out of date though. The required software did not come on a cd, but on a floppy disk. MY COMPUTER DOESNT EVEN HAVE A FLOPPY DISK!! Even when I went out and bought an external floppy disk drive I had the nice surprise of finding out that this product only supports Windows M.E. and below."
5,"If you love your dog, you will read this book!",I've read this book three times now. I've learned more about preventing and dealing with catastrophic diseases than I would ever learn from our vet. Goldstein presents page after page of evidence that the food we feed and the vaccinations we inflict annualy on our animals is actually doing more harm than good. Our pets don't need to be dying so young. We are literally killing them with kindness. I have recommended it to every dog owner I know.
5,Sound principles for animal (and human) health!,"I was able to hear Dr. Goldstein speak at the spring convention of Dynamite Specialty Products. As a wholistic health practitioner, I find Dr. Marty's program and basic philosophy sound. His clear love of animals and willingness to put his career on the line in their defense and for their healing is inspiring.Dr. Goldstein's paperback edition of this book will be out in July 2000. It will contain recommendations for using the Dynamite products (chemical-free & no by-product dog food, amino-acid chelated supplements, chemical-free parasite control, etc.) to keep your pets healthy. Put this one on your gift list for all animal lovers!I am a human and equine massage therapist (the HorseWorks) and these principles are sound for any mammal on the planet. Read and learn! Dr. Marty's humor infuses the book with wonderful readability and many many case histories. If you love your pets, you need this book's information to keep them healthy and happy."
3,The Importance of our Pets Health,"I have worked as a veterinary assistant and one of the key roles that people have as pet owners is the maintenance of their pets' health, basically through nutrition and check-ups. I agree with this book that we really have to be careful as to what we feed our pets, many of the grocery store brands are not the quality they say they are. We recommend specialty foods from the pet shops which are free from by-products and chemicals. This is a good point that is brought up in this book. We are now cutting back on the vaccinations that are administered and understand that they are often given too frequently. This is the main point of this book, I believe, and many veterinarians are addressing these issues today.As far as many other issues in the book, they are vague and speculative and not backed up with proof, although they do sound good and make for good writing."
2,How can you decide who to believe?,This book was very informative and actually alarming. I would like to verify the information but am unsure how to go about it. My vet does not believe all the claims against the pet food. Who do I believe?
2,"Helpful, but somewhat out of date with the advanced information available today.","Book provided some of the basic information for homeopathic care and treatment for our '4-footed children'. Basic information is great, but the information on medical advances made in the several years is lacking in this book. If you want to learn the basics - this is a good place to start."
5,excellent book,excellent book for learning more about your pets and their nutrition and how to help them be healthy w/o a lot of allopathic intervention which sometimes does more to hurt than to help.
5,A MUST READ FOR CAT & DOG OWNERS,"Dogs and cats should also be evaluated as whole beings. Dr. Goldstein's book is a careful, detailed, and easy to understand account of your pet's health and how to prevent potential issues and illness. He also talks about understanding your pet emotionally and spiritually. This is a terific reference book to all who love their pets and are open to give them the best care possible.What a wonderful way to give back."
4,Good Advice for Dogs but not so much for Cats?,I really liked the practical advice given on the nature of healing and how to work with your animalsto help heal themselves. I think the advice is best for dogs than for cats. I tried to make my cat ahomemade cooked food diet to help with her endless loose stools but it didn't really help her very muchat all. It was probably a better diet for dogs with the same problem.
2,The Nature of Animal Healing : The Definitive Holistic Medicine Guide to Caring.,"I was disappointed in this book. I had expectations that I would learn something new, but alas, I did not. I have used a holistic vet for years and this was the same old thing. I thought he would go into more detail on treatments. Since my vet has passed I have had to do a lot on my own. There are not a lot of holistic vets around. I would think this would be a great book for someone new to the holistic arena."
3,What happened to IAT?,"I have a dog with a fibrosarcoma on his face. It gave me great hopes to read about IAT therapy in his book and I contacted Dr. Marty's clinic in NY. My guess is that the FDA threatened him in a very serious way. They shut down the program that was doing the curing. He actually told me to go with radiation therapy on my dog! The entire book is against it, even today there is no scientific evidence that radiation therapy is effective against fibrosarcoma.... on the other hand, several reliable sources of fact based evidence list radiation as a cause for fibrosarcoma. That was all the great Dr. Marty could recommend? So sad. I wish the Dr. Goldstein who wrote the book was still around. It is a good book with good information... at least he left that behind."
4,Definitely worth reading!,"I learned many things from this book and further it made me want to order all of the books in the reference section too! (which I did, for most of them..:)...It would have been wonderful, however, if the author was more specific on the exact recipes he used not only on himself but to his brother's dog, for example, but still, it is a very well written, very interesting book!"
1,"Animal Healing, this is the same book as Animal Healing","When I recieved this book, Page forpage it is the same as the first bookAnimal Healing . They just cahnged thename. If I knew this, I would not haveordered it. Sue Ropelewski"
1,WHIMSICAL AT BEST,"I WAS LET DOWN DUE TO THE LACK OF USABLE INFORMATION. LOTS OF USELESS WORDIENESS. SOME WHAT SIMILAR TO A CHEAP NOVEL. I EXPECTED MORE. ON THE OTHER HAND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND 'HOMEOPATHIC CARE FOR CATS AND DOGS', BY ,DON HAMILTON,DVM. HIS BOOK IS WRITTEN AS A GUIDE OF INFORMATION GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER, WITH A REASONABLE OPENING TO FAMILIARIZE ONE WITH THE IDEA OF HOMEOPATHIC CARE. HE INCLUDES NAMES AND ADDRESSES AND PHONE & FAX NUMBERS OF HOMEOPATHIC SUPPLIERS HE INCLUDES THEIR WEB SITE AND E-MAIL ADDRESSES. PLEASE KNOW I HATE GIVING BAD REVIEWS BUT I ALSO HATE HAVING PEOPLE WASTE THEIR MONEY AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A WASTE."
1,"totally anecdotal, emotional appeal with no scientific backu","many stories of miracles but style is overly emotionaal and refuses to acknowlege need of reputable scientific study. -- psychobable for the already converted--but interesting to read as a source of ""what""s out there"" a trend of things to come and undoubtably financially dependent on the desparately gullible"
2,The Nature of Animal Healing,"I'd give this 2.5 stars if that option were available.This book is written more in a journal form than a reference form. If you are interested in reading about one vet's proud experiences and ideas of his own practice, then this book is for you.There is some useful and interesting information throughout the book, but I find Goldstein rather arrogant and narrow minded in his writing. The meat of this book is about his own case studies (in the form of stories), which aren't very thorough and contain a lot of ramblings on of his own interests and ideals.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you are interested in learning more about holistic and natural care for your pet, there are so many other books out there. Leave this one on the shelf."
3,My Views on this Book,"Although this book seemed good in theory, it was not backed up with enough scientific/medical evidence. I liked what I read about not buying pet food in our ""grocery"" stores, but purchasing food in the better pet food supply houses. I happen to feed my dogs and cats Innova pet food and have had good results but don't have the time to cook for them very often - not balanced meals that they would eat anyway. I have read articles about ""What's really in pet food"" on the internet, so this wasn't a surprise. But, I would have to say, in general, although it was a fairly good book, it wasn't backed up enough with sound scientific/medical information."
3,Fair Information,"This book had its fair share of information, although I have seen much of it in other books before, including similar information on the websites. It wouldn't be my first choice as far as a recommendation, I would suggest first and foremost books by Ann N. Martin and Don Hamilton."
5,If animal's could talk he is who they would ask for!,"I have read many other natural pet books, but from the start Dr. Goldstein makes the road to a succesful plan sound easy. His view on alternatives to vaccines and the healing crisis is just imeasurable. I own a priminent pet sitting company and I wish that his book was around for the many clients that I have lost due to immune related cancers due to vaccines and the way of feeding that we did for our aninal's. My client's are definitely getting copies of this book."
3,"Informative, but unscientific","This book was more like a series of anecdotes, I skimmed through half of it (lots of rambling). I think it is overall informative and useful, but most of what he states is unsupported by any evidence -- even statistical claims that would be fairly easy to cite are not. The diet chapter, for example, sounds like he just cobbles together meals for his dogs that magically work (including slices of pizza -- that was a little odd because he seems obsessed with a healthy diet). The most useful chapters were on vaccination and the list of health concerns -- I bought this book mostly for that."
5,Vaccinations,"This chapter is mandatory to read if you really care about your pet. It's an eye opener.Also, Chapter 2 on food is also a priority."
5,A Must Read,This is a must read for all pet owners. I wish I had gotten this book sooner. Could not put the book down. We are killing our pets with drugs and this offers an alternative. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!
4,Great Information,"If you are looking for more information, as I have been, this is a good book. It was very helpful. I am reading practically everything I can find regarding dog health as my 4 -year old Siberian cross just developed epilepsy. I have discovered that each book I get has an extra bit of information that I did not glean before from other books. (Good for the booksellers, right?) But seriously, it has good information! I recommend it."
5,Alternative Pet Medicine,Understand the benefits of a good diet and learn holistic medicine techniques to care for your furry friend.
5,storm window,"Excellent product, does exactly what intended. Made storm windows for my enclosed porch. Built frames out of 3/4 x 1 1/2 pressure treated wood from Lowes, stapled the film on then nailed flat screen moulding to secure the edges.Highly recommended ."
4,A fine guilty pleasure,"Hadn't heard this one in 25 years, and it had been a guilty pleasure when last I heard it, because I was leaving the prog world at that time. Hearing it again, Anderson wrote some fine melodies on this record. I always liked the Solstice Bells song and Jack in the Green but some of the others were better than I remembered. Many fine instrumental sections, too, although the guitar had gotten very stylized by this time. And the production is way over the top as usual when Robin Black had the knobs. I think he also did Passion Play and Benefit. I dislike the splice jobs that the Jethros resorted to so often in this period because sudden, wrenching changes of instrumentation kind of break the flow. The lyrics can be a bit crude, but it's an entertaining spin."
5,A must for all Tull fans,Ian Anderson and crew deliver. Rock meets Renaissance. Anderson is still the best Rock flautist hands down. I love that it has the live version of Velvet Green as an addition to the original release of this album on vinyl.
5,"In the Forest, Enjoying the Music!","An album with staying power. If you are enchanted with Celtic music, folklore and folk music, presented with panache and expert musicianship, you cannot go wrong with this album. Haunting and unforgettable, the lead singer and the musicians weave a spell that will take you deep into the mystical and naughty woods of yore. Spellbound, you will dance and sing among the trees, on velvet grass so green, and feel the presence of the fae just a reach away."
5,Songs from the Wonderful,"Ian Anderson's Jethro Tull reach an apex of over the top perfection in this album. The group had been reaching for this sound from the beginning, but studio technology hadn't caught up to Ian's creativity until 1977. From the opening, an a capella chorus, you know this is not your ordinary Jethro Tull Album. The band romps trough a perfect blend of folk, rock, medieval ballad, jazz and blues, often within one song! The tempo changes are wonderful and Ian's flute sounds absolutely diabolical, with just the right touch of the blues, whirling over layers of folk,prog-rock and church organs! Ian sounds like the minster from hell when the band stops to let him sing over an acoustic guitar. The sounds coming out from the speaker conjure a latter day hunchbacked jester spewing spells. One of the best folk-prog album of the 1970's.Max MilanoAuthor of ""The Mechanicals of Recoleta"""
5,Songs is the ultimate Jethro Tull,This is the ultimate Jethro Tull album with Thick as a Brick a very close 2nd.
1,"I might make you feel, but I can't make you...","THINK. What are the chances that someone botched the recording of each track of ALL TWENTY of Jethro Tull's studio albums, such that each needs desperately to be mucked about with (or ""remastered"")?THINK. If attaching out-takes, interviews, radio snippets, and live recordings, pretty much whatever can be dredged up, in fact, to ALL TWENTY of Jethro Tull's studio albums constitutes a bonus, why doesn't it incur the record company any extra expense? 1) No extra physical material is being proffered; these ""bonus tracks"" are not being put on separate discs so that you can listen only when you feel inclined. 2) All the ""bonus tracks"" had already been recorded and were lying about; there was no recording overhead either."
1,original: 3 stars; this version: one star.,"This, in its original form, is probably the best Tull since ""A Passion Play"", but that's not saying much: Ian Anderson never fully recovered his artistic self-confidence (it seems) after his critics maliciously savaged that brilliant record (and to a greater extent the ""Passion Play"" concert tour, which actually did deserve unfavorable criticism). Its follow-up included the cynically conceived vapid hit single ""Bungle in the Jungle"", precursor of ""Songs from the Woods""'s ""The Whistler"". The remaining music and lyrics here, not counting the ""bonus tracks"", are pleasant but un-inspired.If you already own Tulls from ""This Was"" to ""A Passion Play"" and desire more, buy ""Songs from the Wood""--but not THIS version: You do not need two renditions of ""Velvet Green"" on the same record, and the ""remastered"" recording quality is distinctly inferior to the original."
2,"Well, maybe THIS is my least favorite Tull album.","This has got to be the least meaningful, and most frivolous, Tull album ever. Apparently Ian had grown tired philosophical jousting, and wanted to take a mental vacation in the country with his pants zipped none too tightly.Thank goodness it wasn't a permanent retirement."
5,A true milestone. One of several masterpieces by JT,"I find myself drawn to the memories of buying this album when I was 13. It was a mature record for me but, I was completely floored by it's incredible musicianship and the songwriting of Ian Anderson. It remains today as one of the most riveting musical experiences of my headphone years. Velvet Green, Hunting Girl, Cup Of Wonder, the title track are all incredible.The entire CD is a tour de force for this band at the pinnacle of their powers. It was an era of ""Punk"" and ""New Wave"". If you listen deeply, you will hear a ""new"" Jethro Tull sound in the music here. It is a ""new wave"" of Tull in production and it's overall development. ""Timeless"" in theme and sound. Which is not something to be said about many of the bands from the revolution of the ""Punk"" and ""New Wave"" era. Songs From The Wood: Unquestionably one the finest Jethro Tull albums in their catalog. I will enjoy this music forever."
5,One of Tull's greatest achievements!,"What an album this is!!! It's hard even to begin talking about it. A mixture of unbelievable arrangements, harmonies, time-signatures - and one of the best group of musicians ever assembled - Songs From The Wood was released in 1977 and marked a shift in direction with Ian Anderson's new-found love for the British countryside. Full of mystical, powerful green imagery, the music speaks for itself in rich, crispy textures. British music at its very best without a doubt. Funny to think England was then all littered with punks who could never even grasp the deeper meanings contained herein.Songs From The Wood may well be Jethro Tull's greatest achievement... But, of course, there are at least five others which would be at the same level: everything from Stand Up to Thick As A Brick and also Minstrel In The Gallery!!!"
5,Jethro Tull At The Top Of Their Game,"If you're looking for another great Jethro Tull album from the 1970's and you already have Aqualung, this is an excellent choice. Ian Anderson and Martin Barre really hit their stride here, producing an album that doesn't get heard very much but is one of the band's finest. They do an outstanding job of evoking a musically-based emotional experience of what life in the woods might be like, while still retaining that Jethro Tull sound. And they do it with a strong mix of acoustic, folk-based music, and harder driving electric guitar rock. The bonus tracks are a nice plus, and the sound quality is excellent."
1,Not What I Thought It Was,Not what I thought it was. The product description did not clarify that you (yourself) had to paint the portrait with water colors. This is not what the picture showed. It showed an actual portrait. I was extremely disappointed when I received the item as it was supposed to be a gift. Do not buy!
1,Cheap Piece of Junk,"This keyboard is a piece of junk. Under normal use, the left click stopped working within a couple weeks of the day I got it."
4,A wonderful storyteller about days gone forever,"Clayton Mack was a great hunter, trapper, guide, and amiable storyteller. He's seen it all. Told from a Native-American --and a humanist--perspective, he says his mama told him ""The only thing you should be scared of are Grizzlies, and White guys"", and he tells some very funny stories about his encounters with both in the deep woods of British COlumbia. I loved this book."
3,Quality questionable,"I ordered the 6-can pack. It looked fine upon arrival but I found that it appears to have been re-packaged. As I opened the ""plastic"" wrapping it was not wrap but tape which made it look as if it had been re-packaged. The act of opening ripped the labels off the cans, one of the cans is very dented - both these things I find unacceptable. The contents look and smell decent so I am keeping it but plan to find another supplier in the future."
3,"Not complete a complete mount, but great otherwise","I bought this mount for a 37"" LCD with a 200mm X 200mm bolt pattern. The ad for this mount clearly states 100 & 200 hole spacing.Wrong. The 100mm X 100mm is there, and 200mm W x 100mm H is there. No 200mmX200mm. For me, not too much a problem since I own a machine shop. I take an hour on a Saturday and machine an adapter plate. For those of you that don't have that option, and need the 200x200 mount, you'll have to find an adapter or hire a shop to make one or find a different mount.And that's too bad, because when the TV is on the mount it's very nice. Truly solid. Easy to install by one person. Easy to get level in one hit. Smooth operation.All that a waste because of the lack of the 200mm X 200mm hole pattern.Otherwise this mount would have received a 5 star rating."
1,Stupid toy,This was possibly the worst toy my son received this past holiday season. The magnets are VERY weak. The pieces are keyed with a little bit of plastic that sticks out of the middle (I would assume this feature was needed to help hold the whole thing together because the magnets are so weak)But it prevents you from building anything else. Once the item is built and the stickers are on it is just basically a building (and a big one at that.) I thought to myself well we could use it on the train table as part of a city etc. Except that it falls apart with the littlest bump. Really stinky toy.
5,Strange and Enduring Stuff,"There are all kinds of reasons to think Joe Doerr won't ever be a popular poet: he likes to write in long sequences; he's interested in obscure areas of Anglo-Saxon history; he quotes large chunks of old Welsh language poetry; he plays complicated games with acrostics and the like. Then again, if you don't mind being a bit bewildered for a while, you might come to find all of these qualities exciting. I know I did. In a poetry scene dominated by easy personal confession, Joe Doerr is fresh air.He also finds all sorts of interesting ways of linking past and present. ""War Music for Steel Guitar"" just kills me, in how it takes a medieval Welsh poem about a dead young man and slowly morphs it into a country song from a Texas bar. You get a real sense of how much history changes, but also how enduring certain emotions like grief can be.It took me a while to really digest this book, but I think I'll remember it for a long time too."
2,DISAPPOINTED ENDING,This book started out with so much promise. It was an excellent mystery/thriller. However the ending was a big disappointment. It ended suddenly and with a character that was never really fleshed out. I've read Lisa Jackson's books before but this one didn't make the grade for me.
3,Good Suspense,"Once I got into the book, I found it suspenseful and full of twist and turns. I couldn't tell the good guy from the bad guy. I did like the character of Nick. I think he was the only redeeming character in the book. It was a disappointment that ""Marla"" had such a tainted past. Her character turned out okay in the end, but when it was finally revealed about her past, I found her thoroughly unbelievable as having changed that much just by having a baby! Also, I would hardly call this book a romance novel. Very little of that truly going on except for lustful thoughts between Nick and Marla. Not much character development."
4,An excellent read!,"I picked up this book after having a little difficulty getting into my first Lisa Jackson book, ""Hot Blooded."" Suffice to say, this was a far easier read. ""If She Only Knew"" keeps the reader guessing right up to the end and Nick is the consummate Alpha Male -- tall, dark and infuriating! I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good, old-fashioned mystery. Once it's solved, you're still trying to tie it all together!"
5,I love this author!,"This book started me on a ""romantic suspense roll""! I really enjoyed this story."
5,A Page Turner,"This book kept me up at night and guessing until the very last chapter. I've lived in San Francisco, so I liked the setting a lot. I'll be looking for more from Lisa Jackson."
5,A Great Romantic Book,Lisa Jackson has out done herself again. I recently read If She Only Knew and was captivated throught the book. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a enjoyable read.
3,"Suspenseful, but repetitive","This is my second attempt at a Lisa Jackson book. I hated the first one I read, but I picked up ""Almost Dead"" to give her a second chance...and upon immediately realizing it was a sequel, I went out and bought this one.While the book was suspenseful, it was really hard to give it any more stars. The characters were unlikeable (especially the main characters), and more than anything, the book was so repetitive! Three times in two pages we were told that Marla's jaw muscles had atrophied from being wired shut. We had to read through pages and pages and pages of Marla and Nick's thoughts on how wrong it was to want each other. Frankly, I think the book could've been 100 pages shorter and not left any of the important plot points out -- if only the author hadn't kept repeating things over and over."
5,Nice read,I recommend this to anyone who likes Lisa Jackson. I have read all her books and really enjoy them all.
5,great,good book i don't have that many words.it is an excellent read. and dont sk me to review any more!
4,Great book!,Another great book by Lisa Jackson. I couldn't put this book down. It kept you guessing throughout the book. A
4,"""If She Only Knew"" by Lisa Jackson",I gave the book four stars instead of five because I had some trouble with the main characte'rs personality toward the end. The book has a really good mystery and romance throughout. I like most of Lisa Jackson's books. The mystery kept me guessing throughout and Ms. Jackson is really good describing places. I will continue to read books written by Ms. Jackson for sure.
5,Great book,I chose a 5 star rating because I couldn't put it down. I took me 5 hours to read. It had enough thrill to get your brain going trying to figure out the bad guys.
1,Bad editing and not a mystery,This book had the worst editing ever. The main character was either Marla or Maria but I did not know which since it switched back and forth throughout the entire book. I found this very distracting. I also wish I had known this was a Harlequin Romance style of book rather than the mystery it had been promoted as.
4,if she only knew,This story had so many runs and kick backs that it really held my intrests.There was a certain undercurrent that you where almost sure you knew what would happen then you got completely lost for sometime only to go in a new direction.
1,Men's Dan Post Boots,"I have worn Dan Post Boots for 30 years. This was my first internet purchase. While the boots look very attractive and fit very comfortably, the leather inside the boots has a foul odor that won't go away. I even let them sit on the back porch to no avail. So I have a brand new pair of boots that folks can smell from around the corner."
2,What the heck?,"When you sit down to write a review and want to compare one volume with another it is a very good idea to know the name of the volume with which you want to compare it. Here in the reviews of the Time Almanac which is a middling work a reviewer compares it to a $90 Oxford almanac--a volume which does not exist. The best small almanac in the past has been the World Almanac because of its accessibility and vast volumes of material. I bought it every even numbered year because it went to press after the elections and therefore I could use it as a reference for political who's who. This year I wasted my money because not only did it not wait for the elections, it did not wait for the World Series. A pox upon it."
4,Superior to Textbooks,"I am a high school student who took AP chemistry last year.Had 2 different textbooks, and I used a friends CliffNotesAP Chemistry book. Arco's book can help you pass the class alone.The textbooks were too long and had unecessary information and theCliffNotes just had too little information."
3,Very Thorough... But...,"I've read through the whole book in preparation for my exam... However... Arco needs a new editor if they haven't caught the mistakes in the many editions of this book's release.There is at least a mistake in every chapter... And for me, a person that needs AP help to see these mistakes? That is pretty disappointing.The good part is that, I did figure out the correct answers and the rest of the book is very thorough in depth and detail."
2,Order with caution,"I ordered this movie from Amazon and it was greatly anticipated by my husband as a gift from me. He remembers it as a very good movie. However, we found we could not play it because this DVD can only be played in ""Play Only"" devices and may not be played in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC devices. This mistake was mine because I didn't read enough of the fine print before ordering. We've returned it and will try to re-order one that will play on our system. (Be aware of this before ordering!) Otherwise, as always before, it arrived in the condition and timeframe expected. We've found Amazon's customer service to be very helpful, efficient and fast."
4,Better than expected.,"I purchased this film because of the score by Erich Korngold, but, acknowledging what often happens with Hollywood biopics, I came to be moved by the film itself. Specifically, because it represents two men originally motivated, given the time, by worthy ideals, but who become antagonists through events and machinations of others beyond their control. Apart from any question of historical accuracy, ""Juarez"" becomes a political drama in the spirit of a Greek tragedy. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Brian Aherne in a role (Maximillian) quite different from those in which I saw him when I was a child."
1,"16"" SHOULD BE LESS THAN 18"" ITEM NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED","PLEASE CHANGE AMOUNTS SO SOMEONE CAN ORDER THE 16"". 18' IS 12.99 AND THE 16"" IS 19.99?ONCE YOU MAKE THE CORRECTIONS I WILL ORDER"
2,An otherwise good book ruined by excessive advertising,"This book would be a great book worth 4 stars if it wasn't for all the advertising in the book. It's a good thing it's spiral bound, and you can always rip out the advertising. This book teaches you a few entry techniques for stocks and options and has forms for recording and paper trading. Get rid of all the damn advertising, and this would be a great book!"
3,Pick some normal stocks for examples,"Once past all the advertising, the book is a good tool for learning when to enter and exit a trade. However, I found that the examples used often are more ""ideal"" than what is actually found in the market. Use some more difficult examples, David, and teach us how to really understand what's going on with a stock."
3,An Informative Look at the Death Penalty,"This book, is a subjective look at capital punishment. The author's unbiased approach makes it a great resource for research papers. It would also make excellent leisure reading material for anyone interested in learning about the death penalty."
2,Pulp Fiction,"Yes, this is the long awaited sequel to H.G. Wells War of the Worlds. But it isn't written by Wells and the author does not have his writing skills nor his imagination. Characters are stereotypes, the story is simple and sometimes just strange.This is a good buy for readers interested in understanding the trash literature of ancient times. But that's all."
5,a VERY Addicting Series..Great!,"Watch the first episode and you're hooked to get through them all asap.I don't know why it's called the complete season one...it's the Complete SERIES. It's ends with the death of Patton.Extremely well made. They used archival footage and tossed in some very good computer graphics to fill in gaps and brought back many of the actual men who served under Patton for new interviews as the events unfolded. Very well done and presented. I must say too, enjoy this and this type of series while we still can. Those brave men who served in WW2 are now in their late 80's to 90's, 10 years from now, this series will be impossible to make as there sadly won't be any survivors left.If you are a war buff, a patriot, a historian or just want to watch some GOOD....get this DVD set. This is a Strong 5 star rating."
2,should be better,annoyingly repetitious--but it showed the great courage and tenacity of the american soldier as opposed to the so-called brilliance of paton
4,good,This was good to show Patton's downside along with his sometimes technical brilliance. Perhaps cut down on the retelling of the story after each obvious commercail break.
4,Don't Have Cable? Buy This!,"I stumbled upon this set while browsing through Amazon and bought this set right away. I don't have cable and miss getting to see some of the tremendous programs that the History channel has to offer. This set is fantastic!My only complaint is how it is produced. For me, the constant flow of ""special effects"" take away from the overall program. After watching for a bit, you DO get used to it, but I don't like the style of the production. It would have been extra special had they had interviews from German combat survivors.It breaks your heart to see combat vets who are 80+ still weep about lost friends. War is hell, that's for sure."
3,This is okay.,I was very excited to get this DVD series. It is good but not great. To me there is just way too much computer generated material on here. There is good information and I did learn some things but it was not my favorite series.
