5,this is such a beautiful and poignant movie,This movie had me glued to the screen. The casting of Shabana Azmi as a distinctly old-school actress playing such a controversial role is an inspiration to young asian lesbians everywhere. There was more eroticism and chemistry in one glance between azmi and das than in entire hollywood movies. Maybe we should take a leaf out of Deepak Mehtas book. He sure knows how to make a film. This is aptly titled as it leaves a burning imprint on the mind. Unmissable and truly unforgettable.
5,Excellent!,"For those who understand Eastern culture, this movie is one of a kind. Controversial and sensitive, it conveys its message to those who want to hear it. Symbolic of the fire that Sita of the Ramayana stands in to prove her purity, this movie portrays the struggles of the dutiful wives who sacrifice themselves for love and duty."
5,"Great, exciting, funny a must see.","Very simply, this is one of the best movies I have seen. It is so much better than the run of the mill Hollywood movies Leonard Matlin is used to reviewing. I guess he did not like it because it did not insert a Caucasian male in it like the ""Joy Luck Club."" The women in the film were superb, physically as well as their acting ability. I have seen the film twice and will buy it."
2,not what i expected,"i had heard soo much about this movie that i had been wanting to get it for such a long time. after i got it i was really disappointed. i found the movie dull, and non eventual. i would pass on this.."
5,Excellent,"I have recommended to all my friends and all of them loved it. The manner in which Deepa Metha get's the message across is just incredible. I highly recommend all you guy's watch this movie once, you love to debate on it many times. Such a complex situation and so beautifully handled. This film is outstanding. It takes your breath away. I have watched this movie a couple of times and enjoyed every moment of it. This movie deserves all and more of the international awards that it has bagged so far."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What an incredibly beautiful film,full of imagery,reality and tenderness.The interaction between the two women was mystical and lucious. A feast for the senses!"
2,awful,"This film has a good story, good actors and plot but it bores me to death because nothing happens between the two lovers. No kisses, no touch. nothing."
1,Useless Lesbian Movie,This movie is a useless movie if you are going to watch it as a lesbian movie. The action is poor to non existant. The plot is sketchy and the idea of woman to woman love is just stuffed into the movie in a tasteless and non practical way. You will regret you ever bought it. It's a perfect example of a sin without any taste in it.
1,Next movie,"This movie is garbage. Just like American films are fictional, this movie is also fictional. How can you compare traditional movies to this movie? You cannot."
5,Excellent acting,"The acting is excellent and the costumes and scenics of India lush and beautiful. The story line will cause you to be angry, sad, joyful and frustrated at various times. It's not a light movie. It provokes you to think and evaluate this situation these two lonely women find themselves in. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Film,"I find it a bit misleading when some people act as if this film is solely a lesbian film, when it isn't. There is much more to this film than the homosexuality factor, so much that it seems kind of irrelevent to even focus on the fact that two gorgeous indian women explore their sexuality with one another. This is a film that broke barriers, and caused an outrage in India when it was released because it stigmatized and contradicted the culture and traditions of India that have never been confronted or questioned. I don't understand why this film isn't recognized for its daring effort and creativity. This film is universal to all people who have conflicts with balancing traditions and their own personal lives at the same time. If only more people would know about this film, and not just look at this as an lesbian film. It's truly a wonderful and well made film. I recommend this to anybody whose interested in the indian culture."
5,Wonderfully Ingenious,"A must see movie. The movie is both innovative and sexy. Shabana and Nandita (the actresses) are sensational. Shabana Azmi is a feminist, a great actress and a member of the Indian parliament. The struggle depicted in the movie is not just something Indian or south asian women face, women all around the world face opression - only the details are different. While this is an excellent movie you should be aware that India is a diverse culture and you cannot represent the people in that culture with some of the generic statements that other reviewers have made here. There are several flavors of middle class India. Many Indian middle class women have excellent careers both in and outside the home and find partners (men and women) who believe in the equality of sexes. There are excellent women scientists, homemakers, engineers, doctors, teachers, members of parliament, etc. who have a great sense of self respect - self respect is not unique to western women :-)"
4,A ground breaking film about Women who fall in love in India,"Fire is the first film from India that confronts the oppression of women in a unique fashion. Two women are drawn to each other as the result of the pervasive unhappiness the confronts them in a culture that has a separate caste system imposed by men. Neither husband pursues intimacy with their perspecitve wives. As a result both women are drawn together. This is a film that lesbians and hetorosexuals will find appealing. Fire is a fine example of art as a medium that addresses poliltical, philosopical and moral issues about life. I found it to be enlightening and entertaining."
5,Take a minute to taste the roses!,"This book is not what you think--it's not a page-a-day calendar for people who prefer not to think or to practice what they preach. This book is for people who want to celebrate being alive. It's for people who know what it means to bend double with laughter--and with tears. It's for every woman (and man) who ever wanted to stop and taste the roses--not just smell them. If you believe that life is full of wealth and joy and harmony, you will love this book--and you will want to spread the good words. Check it out!"
4,tai chi practice music,"This is one of the better practice music cd's that I own. It sets a good pace for doing traditional Yang style taichi. If you are not into form work, the tracks are great listening, background music. Very sweet. Just do some standing and listening."
4,nice traditional style Chinese music,"When I ordered this, I was expecting something more like 'new age' music. This is perfectly nice music, it sounds just like I would expect low key Chinese traditional style music to sound. Like great background music for a restaurant or a dinner party. It has some nature sounds mixed in, as other reviews have remarked, the nature sounds fit in well.This music is nice, its convenient that each track is 10 minutes long, and the CD jacket has a nice short explanation of standing meditation in English (and in Chinese)I can't find anything that is particularly meditative about this music, and as I said, it is nice Chinese music."
5,Amazing for Meditation,"The music in this album is absolutely gorgeous. Usually, I'm not happy with attempts to mix nature and music, but this album breaks my stereotypes! Natural sounds are blended with human instruments to create an auditory setting that quickly and gently pulls you into a meditative state. My taiji/qigong instructor uses this music in her classes and I fell in love with it the minute I heard it -- and I wasn't alone. If you're looking for music to perform taiji, qigong, yoga, or just for meditation, this album is a must!"
5,Flow with the wind,This CD is very good with authentic Asian style play. Relaxing at work or home. Good music for massage. The inside cover shows martial arts stances if you are wanting to practice them while listening to the music.
4,Another good one,I have always enjoyed the Matthew Bartholomew series and this one does not disappoint.
5,"""Lost In Queens"" ~David Bixler","This CD is an enjoyable mix of bebop and contemporary styles to form a sort of NYC 52nd street sounding small ensemble. The color of Bixler's alto and Wendholt's trumpet is used quite tastfully and it is a subtle mix of standards and originals. Anyone wanting a sort of ""jazz now"" in their ears should feel welcome to pick this up."
4,An enjoyable and entertaining DVD,Gil Shaham is a fine violinist and one of the best of the current crop of premier violinists. He does a fine job on these Haydn and Bruch works with the able support of Mr. Ettinger.
3,A Bit Let Down,"After buying and drooling over Kaffe Fassett's Glorious Patchwork, I waited expectently for this book. After 8 months of trying to find it in stores, I purchased it sight unseen from Amazon.com. I was very let down when I got the book. Most of the patterns were repeats from Glorious Patchwork. There are though, complete instructions for completing the quilting projects and with codes so you can order the actual fabrics that were used in the quilts. The book was originally published in England so some of the phrasing is a bit different to American ears. I give this book three stars (might have given it more except for being spoiled by the previous book)."
1,Truly Disappointing,"If you already own Glorious Patchwork (a great book) by Kaffe Fassett, you don't need this book. There is only one ""new"" pattern in this softcover booklet and the quilts and photographs are much better in Glorious Patchwook - which is a great inspiration on color. While there are better instructions on piecing, I didn't want a quilting how-to book. Better options for how-to books are Joy of Quilting or a book by Nancy Martin, Judy Hopkins or Marsha McClosky."
4,good quality,"Good quality toy. I bought the toy for my son, he loves it. Very happy with it, figure is just like the video games. He is very pleased"
4,Life and Times of Gays in New York in 1978,"An interesting story featuring the life of different gays living in New York. Their pet names, their lifestyle, their loves, their parties, their summers at Fire Island, thier hopes their dispair.Fred Lemish is tired of the life and wants to settle down with one person. Two aging gays who love leather and younger men, but have each other.Life at the Everhard Baths. Their round of parties and dressing up.It was a wonderful peak into how they lived, loved, hated, dressed up and hid their lifestyle."
2,A Big Letdown,"I put off reading this book for a long time and was looking forward to reading it this summer. Even though Larry Kramer can be called a prophet with his lacerating vision of what happened when gay liberation came along at a time when America was on a sexual expedition (and unaware of the awful plague that was coming down the pipeline), the novel gets weighed down with too much repetition and not enough objectivity. Not even halfway through the book, I got tired of reading exploit after exploit without any narrative balance. I'm sure it's accurate in its depiction of the era, but I would've liked one narrator to step in and throw some kerosene into the mix. After a while, the satire becomes bland and you could care less about any of the men. Still, it's frightening to see how little some things have changed."
1,Booooooorrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiinggggg,"If you are in the mood for a long, whiny, long winded rant by all means read this book right away!The first pages of the book talk about how many gay people live in the various boroughs of New York City and how they outnumber the Jews, as if this is some significant demographic. Who cares? Most people don't live in New York. The whole thing just comes off as overly bitter and negative."
4,How to describe ....,"My friends and I read this when it first came out - covertly. We were all very young and just coming out ourselves. Within the pages of this book we found exactly what Larry Kramer did not intend for us to see: a sexy, partying, unfettered, glamorous gay New York. Uh,huh. The satire was lost on us. Rather, we all talked about partying our ....off and moving to New York. We lived in Boston- so we did the weekend thing instead. Anyway, this is one trippy, weird and excessive novel. I really think all the excess undoes his intent and turns this into a Jackie Collins on hormones and mda extravagana. Of course, that does not mean that it wasn't entertaining and the not-to-distant future ultimately proved Larry's point for him. Dance from the Dance does a much better job at tackling this theme."
2,What I received was not what is pictured. It rises up past being level with the ramps.,"Don't purchase this if you are expecting a platform like the one in the photo. The item I received does not look like this, and rises up well above the level of the platform. It is useless for my planned purpose of putting a jack on it."
1,Beware!! Now made in China!,"This was Wacoal's best selling bra for a reason, comfortable supportive, wonderful. For years it was made in the USA, and I was happy to pay the premium price. Now it is made in China, the fabric feels flimsy. The padding on the channeling is not near as nice as the original. The wire twists in the channel. I've bought nicer bras at Walmart for a third the price.To add insult to injury they moved production to China and raised the price by 20 percent. This is not the bra Wacoal built their reputation on. I hope they rethink and move production back to the facility that made their name. This bra is a loser. Don't waste your money."
3,Don't produce this product in China,"I purchased this identical bra from an upscale department store. That bra was made in the Dominican Republic. High quality construction and very comfortable.This bra, purchased from Amazon, was made in China. Construction appears to be the same but the underwires poke and chafe badly. I am very disappointed in this new bra. I also purchased the Everyday bra, it is made in the Dominican Republic and is delightfully comfortable.I would suggest Wacoal discontinue using China as their production site for this particular bra."
5,Very Comfortable/Would Recommend,"I am a petite person who always has trouble with bras. I am small in frame, but not necessarily in the bust area. I wear 36-D. I have purchased bras, in the past, in this size and have had to ""take in"" the straps myself. These bras accomodate my situation. No complaints, bras are pretty, very well made, and worth the price!! I have ordered two diff.types recently, but both by ""Wacoal"", and both purchases suggest that it is better to pay a bit more for a well-made and extremely comfortable bra. I am impressed!!!! Thank you, I am glad to have finally found you!!"
3,Nice support bra,I own two of these bras and they offer good support. I would recommend this bra for large cup size woman.
2,wears out too quickly,"These paticular wacoal bras wear out too quickly for me,lasting only a few months,even though I still keep wearing them at $60 a pop!!! The other issue I have is the underwires in these bras are always cut too short and never go from point A to point B, so they poke me in my side!!! and the third issue is that the underwire area is always too scratchy under my breast."
4,If you have to wear a bra this is the one!,"I'm hard to fit and like lift and support, this bra does it all. No sweams make it a ""go to"" bra for any occasions. I return to buy this same bra year after year. For me, it's been worth the extra cost because it lasts longer then cheaper versions. Very well made."
5,Best bra ever,"I haven't owned a bra that fit like this one, and was as comfortable, since I wore training bras! Just love it!"
2,Only intended for users with *no* experience in programming,"If you have a little bit of experience (even BASIC!), than 60% of the book will bore you (what is a variable, etc.) and the rest will not treat the topics in any depth. From Windows NT users a certain minimum knowledge can be expected and NT specific topics are not treated enough (i.e. how to maintain user accounts etc.). Too much blank space and lines in the book, it could be reduced to less than a third in pages without reducing the text and the readability."
4,Handy for my use,"These little hooks came in very handy in my living space, which has all metal walls. I'm in the military and we live in containers. The hooks were good in that the magnets were large and held whatever I hung on them. However, the hooks were pretty small so only held small or lightweight items."
4,Best book by Peter Taylor,"The title is a bit pompous. The book looks like another regurgitation of already well written world-systems garbage. Surprisingly, though, Peter Taylor has come up with something more readable than Arrighi's ""The Long Twentieth Century"" and perhaps more theoretically sound. I am currently writing a Masters thesis in political geography, and I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book after a plethora of others by Taylor and Arrighi. Having read a good dozen books on hegemony, this is my favorite one yet. If it weren't for the outrageous price (get it from the library!), it might be the book that would convert other structuralists over to world-systems theory. If you are into geohistorical analysis or hegemonic discourse you must read this book. Kudos to Doctor Taylor! Job well done. (His book ""Modernities"" was excellent too!)"
3,"Cute, but a little dissapointing...","For Marilyn fans, this book is a nice addition to a collection. I learned several neat facts and tid-bits about Marilyn's lifestyle, but it didn't focus on anything specific. It was more of a vague instruction manuel for impersonaters. It also focuses on the author's life just as much, if not more, as it does on Marilyn's. I was hoping to get a book on Marilyn's mannerisms and the like-- but I was disappointed. I'm glad it was a gift to me, and that I didn't have to pay for it myself."
3,Be (a) Marilyn.... Impersonator,"I read this book years ago and liked it, so when I saw it priced cheap on Amazon I thought, "" What the heck?"" It really is more about the author than the subject. That is, somewhat, the point. She writes about what she does to reproduce Marilyn's appeal and how you can bring elements of her appeal into your life. Basically, it is a fun read and nothing more. I would not spend more than a few dollars on it."
4,A beautiful gift to offer or receive,"This is an interesting book.The only reason I will not give it 5 stars,is because I found it to be a little narcissistic in its nature and premise.It has that feeling of being yet another opportunity for Ms. Addis to show off how much she looks like Marilyn.Apart from that,I guess it could be very helpful for Marilyn wannabees,with its tips,makeup and otherwise.It is presented in high-quality fashion.Not a cheap book:beautiful pictures,good quality paper and presentation.Would make a nice present"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was disappointed in the content of the book. It's title, IMHO, over-promises information regarding living blonde like Marilyn Monroe. The review of MM's hair and make-up techniques is cursory. Similarly, the review of MM's mannerisms (for those who intend to impersonate MM) offers little except the advice of renting her films and practicing what is seen. Few specifics are spelled out. The book is still an interesting read for the few scraps it offers, and I would have rated it 3-stars (instead of the 2 I gave) had the price been lower to reflect the content."
3,Needs more revisions,"Buy this book, then come back here after you've finished it and tell me it doesn't read like a badly pruned tree.This was about two revisions away from being a good book. It seems that many subplots are at work, since there are multiple main characters, and none of them are fulfilled or even relevant in many cases.2 and a half stars, at best, but I can't split stars."
4,Fascinating read,"Originally I purchased this book back in the early '90s. But loaned it to a friend and never got it back. This book is fascinating, it that it predicts the Cold War between the US and Russia, and is a fairly clear and accurate look into a future the author was not able to see first hand.There were more than a few US Generals at the time, who could also see what was coming, and wanted to take on the Russians at the time. One can only imagine how different the world could have been, had they achieved their objective.This book shows the author wasn't completely disoriented during the battle for Berlin. He saw the writing on the wall, and tried to leave a warning."
3,"Provacative, interesting","The writing style for this short volume is from the same hand that wrote Mien Kampf. It is lucid, quick whitted and lashes out with strong brush strokes, assaulting the nations of Europe and encouraging German minorities to rise to the occasion. This book was the work of Hitler in the late 1930s when he had obtained power but prior to the beginning of World War Two. The first chapters detail the authors interest in the German minorities and their rights throughout Europe. The latter part of the book delves into the importance of America in Germanys coming conflict.In the end this book is not much more enlightening then Mien Kampf in shedding light on the psychology of Hitler. Although some new material is included mostly this will appeal to the German/Nazi enthusiast. The writing becomes boring and you get the feeling you've read the same point again and again."
1,Unpublished sequel??!!,"..Then why is it that I can go down to my local library and find several editions of this VERY SAME BOOK in print???!?!?! Already, I am seriously questioning the validity of this work. This book was first published in 1961....and I think I will be reading that version...the FIRST EDITION!!! Anyone who tauts that this is some newly discovered work had better do some research. The manuscript was discovered after the war....and if it takes almost 50 years to publish the ""unpublished sequel"", then something's rotten in Denmark! Get the first edition."
4,A important historical document,"This book is intersting in the sense that it helps us understand better the views of Hitler in the way of foreign policy, especially towards the United States. Altough the book was published in french in the 1960's as L'Expansion du Reich, this edition offers great footnotes by Gerhard L. Weinberg that help us better understand the historical elements developped by Hitler in his manuscript.While this book might not appeal to the general public, it is defenetly worth purchasing for people intersted in the history of fascism, nazism, Hitler (see also Hitler by Kershaw) or Germany."
2,Idea's for title,"Since the book is untitled, allow me to help the publisher, here are my suggestions:1- The Second Printing of a ""never printed book""2- My dad used to punch my face in, so now let me hate an entire race of people and write a book on it3- Obsessive compulsive egomaniac's 'struggle': volume 2"
1,what a yawn,"I was underwhelmed to say the least. I flipped through this book in minutes and was totally disappointed. If you want a book with GREAT recipes and beautifully ""stacked"" plates, get the Top Chef cookbook or the Top Chef quick fire cookbook, they blow this one away!"
5,I STILL love it,"I bought this in 2003. Is vertical food out of fashion? Not so trendy anymore? Who cares. I think everyone likes a beautiful presentation and the recipes in this book are not only lovely to look at, they are actually good. The recipes would be good even if they weren't ""stacked"". Plus, the book inspires you to be creative and think of variations. I still love this book and refer to it often. I wish there was Volume II."
1,Not for all Toyota 1990 and up,"I ordered this along with Parrot MKi9200 for my 2006 Toyota Tacoma and fortunately, it never arrived, so Amazon is going to refund me. The reason why I said, it was a good thing that it never arrived, was because I wouldn't be able to use it even if it did arrive. Yes, I did enter the Year, Make and Model of my vehicle at the very top of the product page for this wiring harness.While I was waiting for the harness, I removed the deck in my truck and noticed that the connections on the back of my desk is different then what is shown in the picture for this item. If you're going to get a harness for your Parrot system go to quickconnectproducts website to make sure you are getting the correct part number."
1,DOES NOT FIT 04 SIENNA W/ JBL SOUND,DOES NOT FIT 04 SIENNA W/JBL SOUND. ON BAG IT SAYS IT COMES WITH INSTRUCTIONS. IT DIDN'T. THIS MADE ME SAD.
4,GREAT BOOK!,Great book for on the road! I was on a long road trip and i read this book on the way there absolutley one of my top books. Keeps the reader interested and The title is just as clever as the book is. a must read for 9-13 year olds who love to travel.
2,not good cd,"I purchased this cd used in my car. I think it should be a good one unfortunately it was not.The items can not being shown in the menu when palying. And, nearly all the music is not a music at all."
4,Better than anticipated,"Right from the beginning, this CD will move you. Track 1 ""I'll Try"" might be the most under-rated or under-appreciated Disney track of all-time. Following this is equally engaging ""When She Loved Me"" from Toy Story. Other good tracks include light-hearted ""Gaston"" from Beauty and the Beast and o course The Siamese Cat song, which is a classic.I held off purchasing this CD as I have other Disney CDs with overlapping tracks, and those tracks on this CD I was unaware of didn't interest me. I'm glad I bought this CD though, because I didn't know what I was missing."
2,"Mostly a dud, unfortunately...","Disney, in my opinion, dropped the ball for the third installment of the disney classics CDs (which is probably why you only see 1 and 2 advertised on TV). The only tracks really worth it are ""I'll Try"" (although I have no idea what that is from) and ""He lives in you"". Other than that, most of the tracks are boring and no up to the level most of the others are. I would not suggest purchasing this cd."
4,Disney Collection Vol. 3,"Good, but not as good as volume 1. Would have preferred more of the recent Disney Classics as they are more fun to sing along with. Ditto for volume 2."
4,Awesome book.,"Starts out a little dry, but it's the necessary building blocks for the rest of the book. This is a great end-to-end description of the science of IW. Good buy!"
5,Candy Classics,"I bought this Cd for my children to listen to in the van on our road trips. They love it! Classics including Sugar Sugar, Hooked on a Feeling, Chewy,Chewy, Yummy Yummy, Buttercup, and more fun, upbeat, feel-good classics the whole family can enjoy."
1,Better ways to waste a day,"This is the sort of novel that makes you think that anyone can write a book. The characters are uninteresting, the plot falls flat after a mildly promising start, and the writing is relentlessly bad."
4,"Dated, but I liked it anyway","I picked this up at a library book sale, and just finished it today.It's dated - no cell phones, laptops, IPODs, etc. so it was a bit of a trip back in time, but i enjoyed the book anyway. I liked the main characters and thought they, and some of the others, would continue to be entertaining in follow-up books.But best of all - I didn't figure out who the killer was until the climax!I hope the author has written more. Great first mystery novel!"
5,"Clinical, precise and brilliant","The industrial pioneers released one of the albums of the year with this. Minor MTV hit Isolation isn't even the best song, as Eggshell and Metamorphosis will attest. The old industrial/thrash chesnut was taken a step further with 'the german James Hetfield' Jurgen Engler firmly at the helm, planting richly distorted riffs down over pumping industrial drum tracks. Very good, and recommended to people who like heavy music with clarity and intelligence"
5,The Boss,"I have never been disappointed with any of Stan Pottinger's previous novels. You always get a good, engrossing story. This is one of those.The protagonists seemed real as they wound there way through this suspenseful and entertaining novel. I very much look forward to his next novel."
1,Not worth the intellectual time,"This book is not worth the time. Only libraries, craving other points of view, should buy this."
2,Small and Rusty,"I love the size of these pans for personal pies, but the rust after only one use makes this a less-than-perfect kitchen vessel.I won't order more.And I do hope that the other items from Fox Run will be better in the no-rust area! Fingers crossed!"
1,Just plain dumb,"Have had the same label problem with the 7"" pan. What a dumb thing to do. If they can't get a simple pie pan right I can only imagine how disappointing their other stuff must be."
4,Two to Dao!,"We are always looking for a fun game to play during our long Minnesota winters! Particularly where there is a balance of skill and luck so that everyone has a chance... I read online that with two really gifted players (not us) this game can end in a draw. We both enjoyed the quickness of play but there is some depth here also.The one rule about surrounding your opponents stone with 3 was somewhat unclear(to us) but I found another set of directions online that clarified. Where this game really shines is the quality of the components, even the bamboo tube that holds everything! The game just looks great set up on a coffee table. Good for all ages but most adults will really appreciate not only how the game plays but the art design--not the usual paper and plastic game components :) Dump the bamboo tube and this would be a really easy game to travel with!"
2,It is too small,"The description is wrong, it doesn't have 12 x 18 x 20 inches, it has at most 12x 20 x 34 cm. It is to small."
2,"More story suspense, even fewer answers.","As with many of these shows, the first season started out pretty well. Frankly, they are exhausting potential topics for the format. The format, by the way, is about 40 minutes of suspense and less than 10 minutes of no answers. To make things worse, The History Channel/A&E are releasing only one half of a season this time (""Season 3, Volume 1""). They apparently have noted CBS/Paramount's marketing practice of DVD releasing. Half season sets cost the buyer more in the long run and generate more revenues. Watch these shows on TV and save your money. You probably won't watch them repeatedly anyway."
5,Lotsa fun but,"This series is a lot of fun to watch even tho the ""team of scientists"" using ""cuting-edge technology"" going out to find evidence to send back to the ""MonsterQuest laboratory"" never finds squat!"
5,Awesome!,"I orderd these online for my 9 month old but when I pulled them out of the box my 4 year old fell in love! He hates wearing bibs but these are so cute he wants to wear them all the time. They fit my 9 month old well, covering his sholders and his entire chest, but they also fit my 4 year old. I wanted these kind of bibs because they don't velcro or snap, you slip it over there head. That way they can't pull it off. And the coverage is great!Update*******That was my original review. It's been almost two years later and these bibs are going strong. After many many washings the decals look as new as day one. I have 16 month old twins, one of whom will not where any bib but these ones."
1,"Do your research, please!","There is quite a bit of erroneous information about both the Catholic religion and Wicca in this book. The author should have done more research when she wrote what she did. Buying this book will only leave the purchaser horribly misinformed about the Immaculate Conception and about the nature of Wicca (there is no black mass in Wicca, for starters.) Its one thing to say one religion disagrees in philosophy with another, it is another to flat-out lie about that other religion. Catholics will recognize her Catholic errors. All in all, the book will mislead readers who are uneducated about either religion, and should be avoided."
3,A little young,I bought this item for my daughter who is going into first grade. I found it a bit young for her as she is already a reader and ready for some challenging activities. I will be ordering the next step.
1,"Very bad, definetely","I think Paolo Meneguzzi is one of the worst Italian singers, the classic stereotype of teenage pop singer.His music isn't original at all, the lyrics less than all, he hasn't got style while singing, he looks like a doll doing lipsync and listen very carefully to the song ""Lui e lei"" (He and She): don't you think that it's copied from ""Cry me a river"" by Justin Timberlake? If you like good music, avoid Paolo Meneguzzi's CDs."
3,This was real work,"This book got me curious because of the reviews. I now see what a lot of people meant. The story is a very (and I mean very) dark tale. There are some pivotal insights, but my feeling is that it is one long brooding about the way her birth circumstance colored her whole being and relations with the world. Written in a very complex fashion that demands you stay with the story and not get lost in the side thoughts."
2,blah blah blah blah,"Poor writing style. Waste of money. If you like a story that spends multiple pages describing furniture or abstract internal dialogue, you might like this. The story could be interesting but it's clouded with too many unnecessary words."
5,"Amazing band, another excellent cd","First, let me say these guys rock me live. Secondly, they have put out another cd which is consistently being enqueued again and again. get it and rock it"
2,"A Rehash, Not a Redefinition","Senses Fail made leaps and bounds with the release of their ""From the Depths of Dreams"" EP, an effort that encompassed such a broad spectrum of human emotion with dark, chaotic music and beautiful lyricism. The band's hugely awaited full-length ""From the Depths of Dreams"" did the band justice, still. They grew more confident in their songwriting and more capable in their hooks.This new effort, ""Still Searching,"" is a huge letdown, all things considered. From a band who, five years ago, helped pioneer the music that hundreds (if not thousands) of bands are now rehashing, Senses Fail have fallen into their own trap. ""Still Searching"" is poorly conceived and forgettable, a lackluster effort. Save your money.The song, ""All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Problems,"" is the standout track on a record that is otherwise a complete failure."
4,Better Than Expected,"I've always been a fan of Senses Fail. I was hooked to their debut EP 'From The Depths Of Dreams"". ""Let It Enfold You"" seemed a little weaker in my eyes but was a decent album, nothing special. I didn't expect much else from this album and didn't plan on buying it until I saw it on sale. Lucky for the album was better than I expected. I think the instrumentals are exceptional compared to the last two albums. The album has a very good sound throughout it, while maintaining the vocal style one would expect from the band. The best tracks from me are ""Calling All Cars"", ""Still Searching"", and ""The Priest and the Matador""."
4,awesome!!!!,"Im a newer Sense Fail listener and i started out with lifes not a waiting room (when borders went down) figured i like the title and the price was right sure i liked cant be saved and martini kiss but omg i was instantly hooked. anyways lets continue i got a couple more of theyre albums and this one is unreal i love it senses fail is that one band who can do no wrongfor me. My favorite songs on here are negative spaces and the preist and the madador i like how they flow together love that its the same beat, cant be saved will always be one of my favorites yeah i know the ones i listed are more popular but its truely a great album i listen to it everytime im down or have arough day always makes me feel better i recommend it if your a fan or just want a good listen"
2,still searching- SENSES FAIL,"a screamo cd which is uncharacteristic for this group.i love their previous ablbums, but this one is, despitetrack, Calling All Cars, is less than appealing for me."
4,Better than I expected,"This was a pleasant surprise. In my personal experience with Dead Milkmen albums, I've found most to be overall great , but with a few throwaway tracks . So I was nervous to be disappointed by a 10-track milkmen cd , out of print at that . This surpassed my expectations. It's short , but a good length , it ends before it gets stale . And I was a little taken aback by the tone of the album , some of the themes and songwriting are a little darker than the typical Dead Milkmen style . Granted , much of the more grim tone is still encrypted on the haywire, immature surface , but it's still a clever , solid album . I'd rank it with the better ones"
5,I have it. Buy it.,"If you like The DM, you'll like this. Mongoose is one of my favorites. Treat yourself, you won't regret it. Do not judge it until you have listened to it 8.5 times."
3,Another one that needs time to grow on you,"Like ""soul Rotation"" this one took time to grow on me. I still like the classic albums of the Milkmen way better, but this does have some good stuff on it. I especially like Leggo My Ego and Jason's Head. The rest of kind of average as far as DM goes and that's why I only give it a 3 star rating. If you're new to DM, go for Metaphysical Graffiti or Eat Your Paisley. Otherwise, this is simply a CD that only DM fans are really going to get into. I don't think anyone will be won over to the band by this one. It's probably their worst as a whole."
1,More fiction than fact,"This book reads like a screenplay more than as a straightforward presentation of Oswald's life story. Because of it's fragmented and surreal style of storytelling, I found the book unreadable."
5,fresh new rock and roll- whodda thunk it??!!,"I'm a 51 year old rock lover who loves the old stuff as much as the next guy but let's face it sometimes you just need to hear some music you haven't already heard 1000 times before. This is not as daunting as it sounds. Contrary to popular belief among my generation there still is good new music being made these days but most of it is of the alt this or alt that variety. Well this record is the real deal, nothing alt about it except for the Jack Keroac style lyrics. This is the record Bruce Springsteen wishes he could make.... if he only knew how to rock."
2,Separation Sunday this is not.....,"I enjoyed Separation Sunday tremendously, an original (although not for everyone) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match. As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own ""resurrection"". This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20. These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks. I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers."
2,"Great classic rock music, tiring and creepy lyrics","I know a schtick when I see one, and Craig Finn's is creepy, pathetic, and tired. Not that he's lazy--he's clearly put a lot of thought and energy into his lyrics, but life is just a lot bigger than the world his songs inhabit. It doesn't help that Finn isn't all that good at portraying the carefree exhuberance of teens getting wasted, which is pretty much all that he writes about. Rather than the escapism of kids looking to get away, he trades more in the nihilism of twentysomethings who've realized there's nowhere else to go. How else can you explain how exquisitely *boring* Finn makes getting oblitterated sound?To be fair, a number of the tunes succeed, (the opening track is monstrous, ""Same Kooks"" absolutely shreds, ""The First night"" is an instant classic), mostly in the top half, but the hit:miss ratio falls off simply because, in my opinion, Finn's central thematic obsession only has enough steam to carry so many songs per record."
4,Good for Hold Steady beginners,"Okay, I didn't really care for Hold Steady's previous album, ""Separation Sundays."" It had great lyrics, but the musical side was lackluster and the lyrics, though the saving grace, were often hard to decipher. ""Boys and Girls in America"" is, however, excellent. The lyrics maintain the same quality, and the musical end has improved drastically. If you've heard a little of the Hold Steady and don't get the appeal, check out this album. Or, if you're looking for a jump-off point, this is it. If you like this album, then you should look into ""Separation Sundays,"" but I would advise going with this one first."
4,The Hold Steady- Boys and Girls in America,"A story of boys and girls growing up in America. Great concept, great music. The sound jumps around a bit but maintains that ""bar- rock and roll"" style. I recommend you purchase Seperation Sunday before buying this album."
2,A disappointment,"""Separation Sunday"" totally rocked. This, not really. Like other reviewers, I was turned off by what seems like an attempt to sound like Springsteen- tinkling piano fills and all. And I think he's taking this ""youth in America"" narrative a little too far- and in the process become corny and boring.Does the world really need an indie Bob Seger?"
2,Wait a minute...,"Comparing the Hold Steady to the Velvet Underground is one thing (and quite a stretch at that) but to imply that they are SUPERIOR to the Velvet Underground is just ridiculous.This is decent stuff, but the vocals are exactly the same on ever song, which gets old fast."
2,Bruce Springsteen circa 1977.,"We need to make this perfectly clear: this CD is pure Bruce Springsteen circa 1977. I mean PURE, to the point where he should think about suing. There are slight hints of other dated music -- Van Morrison, Warren Zevon, (adding insult onto injury) Randy Newman -- but it's pretty much unadulterated Bruce down to the ""rocking"" piano parts and harmonica solos.if you're interested in music of *this* century, then, this isn't something you'll want to listen to. This CD will find its fans: I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to hear it blaring from every frat bar in town. But I like new, current music -- stuff that's fresh and original and surprising -- which means I won't play this thing again."
1,Fooled again,"Read the reviews. Buttons pressed - Replacements, Springsteen... Buy CD. Insert. First track... thirty seconds in and you get that sinking feeling. You know that this is probably as good as it will get and it is poor. Struggle through the rest of the album, hoping for some respite, but no, it maintains the same level of life-wasting mediocrity all the way through.I don't mind the ""Oh poor us, look at all the drugs we've taken"" lyrics, because there is a long line of honourable successes in that field, but I do mind having to listen to songs with little apparent melody or construction, only crude riffing, and with no sense of transcendence. Westerberg and Springsteen have that sparkle and this group does not.Life is short so do not waste your time here. Do not drag down your music collection by having this. Mine is going back."
1,horrifyingly bad,"This is perhaps one of the worst bands to come out in recent memory. Tuneless, ridiculous songs about dumb fictional girls who smoke pot and eat chips ahoy or something like that. Yeah I get it, he's telling a story, a really bad one and yeah I get it , it's supposed to be ""itelligent bar rock"" but honestly the singer has zero redeeming qualities, the lyrics are borderline laughable. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND. This is a band for aging music critics who never get laid! Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,"Wonderful Poems, but not what I expected","I bought the book as a gift for my wife who just gave birth to our first child. I read a poem on amazon and it was absolutely wonderful, as are all the poems in the book. However, I was looking for more of a general collection of mother's poems, and the poems do have more of a religious tone although it does seem to be non denomiational that does reflect the title than what I was looking for. But if you are looking for that type of book, I would highly recommend the book, if you are just looking for a general collection of poems, this is not the book for you."
2,Less than what I expected,"Wanted to buy this to encourage a new mom, but there is so much about ""how hard it is"" to be a mom that I decided not to give it as a gift."
2,Very Basic,I'm a big fan of Merriam Webster but this book was a massive disappointment. Definitions very short and suitable for only the most basic applications. For something compact try the Tabers
3,It works for me,This is a basic medical dictionary -- no more or less than expected.It serves the purpose.
4,Merriam-Webster's Med. Dictionary,Received product in good condition. Using product as of now. Thank you for your help.
5,good reference book,this dictionary has helped alot in my studies of the medical field. would recommend to someone who is studying to work in the medical field
5,Recommend by my EMS Class,Quick Reference book for some of the medical terminology and definitions. It was recommended by my EMS class. Light weight and easier to carry around then one of those encyclopedia dictionaries.
4,Forties Fabrics by Joy Shih,A lovely reference to add to my collection on historical and cultural textiles. Good crisp photographs and the context and photographs supported my enjoyment of this book.
2,Parts unavailable,"I bought this TV less than 2 years ago and it has worked well until last month when I turned it on and there was no picture. I have tried several repair shops and Samsung-USA's service center, and the consensus is that I'm out of luck because they no longer make or stock parts for this TV, including the scan module that I apparently need. It's not a bad little TV, but you should be aware that you might go to turn it on one day and find that it is irreparable junk."
4,Good TV bad Monitor.,"This TV is really nice. Image quality is great, and the TV is very stylish. However, using this TV as a video monitor was a bit of disappointment so we will just use it as a TV. If you're looking for a great picture with standard cable, then it works great. As a computer monitor it is not nearly as crisp as I expected it to be."
3,How do I remove borders?,"Does anyone know how ( or if ) I can watch this TV in full screen mode - with no borders. I have a Dish HD Satellite receiver - The 5 or 6 HD channels look great and use the full screen but when I select the other 150 channels ( not broadcasting in HD ) this 23"" TV becomes a 19"" TV. I selected wide mode ( does not give an option for full screen mode ) I agree with most of the other owners that this is a great monitor, especially for the money, but I haven't heard anyone complain about those 2"" borders on both sides of the picture. Works great as a PC monitor and uses full screen. Any feedback would be appreciated PS If I can get rid of these borders this TV gets a 5 star rating - if not, it's a 1 star. Am I the only one with this problem?"
1,No good for gaming.,"If you want this TV for gaming... buy it at a brick and mortar store so you can return it if you find, like me, that the reaction time of the television is too slow, making everything that moves blurry. It might be great for watching television and DVDs but, in my experience, it's no good for gaming. It couldn't handle the fast action of the 1991 classic Sonic the Hedgehog via Sonic Mega Collection... it made it look worse than on a 20"" Magnavox. It doesn't just blur 2D games either. The problem was also noticeable in Radiata Stories for the PS2 where anytime the character was moving the background blurs which doesn't happen on any other television in the house.I give it a one star for gaming. I can't, and didn't care to, rate it on anything else."
3,Black and White,"Well the TV seems to have a lot of special functions, but one thing that was bad was the image that here in Brazil only appears in de Black&White mode. I called to the technical support and they told me that it was because of the TNT technology and I was supposed to get something to make my TV works as it was supposed to. Before I have bought this TV, I had the opportunity to have another brand of LCD TV and I didn't have this problem."
1,Missing Aynet---limited viewing,My shipmet is missing Aynet Devise !!!I will gladlyreview it once I get it.Urgent!!!----
5,paleale1,"I'm not sure how I lucked out with deal but I'm not going to complain. I went to Circuit City to look for a 20+ inch LCD TV and compared 10-15, really leaning towars the Sony or Samsung models. When I was about to leave the salesperson asked if I had seen the LNR238W yet. They hadn't received any in the store yet but it was on their website as a 'Coming Soon' item for $1,099. I went home and looked online for the model and was able to find it on Amazon for $850.00 with shipping. I bought it that same day and am glad I did. The best part of this TV by far is the picture quality. It's gives a nice crisp picture on any channel and handles fast motion with ease. The only issue I have is that it doesn't provide wall mounts that will work with this model, so for now I have it on it's base. All in all, it was a great deal and I'm surprised that Amazon is now asking $1,000 for the same model two weeks later."
4,Very happy with product,I am having trouble finding a mounting bracket (for wall mounting) for this unit. The holes in the back do not correspond to standard mounting hardware. Samsung does not seem to have an answer. At least not yet.I am very happy with the unit itself!!!
4,good monitor for bedroom,"First of all,to answer michael G....i have dish too,i have a 211 hd reciever,do you have a 811?i had a 811,you can stretch the picture by using the remote(format button).also make sure in your reciever settings that in HD setting it is set to widescreen 16:9 and not 4:3.if that dont work,then u have a dish reciever problem..hope that helps.i bought this tv from bestbuy for 899,picture is much brighter and better detail than my mits rear projecting tv.I bought it as a 2nd HD monitor for the bedroom.all seems good.cons:no swivel base"
2,Not for gaming....,"Got this TV last week, and im just packing it up to return it. I bought to be used with my xbox and my future xbox 360. After hooking it up to my xbox with a first party HD pack and booting up halo 2, I immediatly felt a delay in the image. I would hit A... Then I would jump. I would pull R trigger... Then I would shoot. Let me stress that the delay is very slight, enough so that some games it wouldnt bother me, but fast paced games cannot be played on this TV. Even when I hooked up my DVD player, I could hear sound out of my 5.1 system before anyones lips moved.Image quality is great, and the TV is very stylish, but I have to warn potential buyers about the delay. Don't make the same mistake I did by listening to all the rave reviews about this TV."
3,"Yes.....they are shipping the 238W""A"" model instead","I ordered the TV as described and also received the 238WA. They sent a replacement and same thing!!!!!!! The 238WA has a lower resolution and is not a TRUE HIGH DEF picture. In addition, I also called Samsung and the woman told me they are the same TV and that they are no longer making the 238w. That is wrong. I had to show her on page 81 of the owners manual that they are in fact different. I will be sending the TV back for a refund. Amazon Customer service has been great.....I just wish there could have been a better resolution to this problem."
5,Wow!,"Very entertainin & informatve dramatic epic WWII story. Tying the real life personal interviews to the characters is super. It's nice playing the picture in picture personal interviews - lends a great deal of depth and realism to the events you watch unfolding in the movie. The Blu-ray video quality is super. Audio is also great. Incoming shells, bullets are bouncing off the walls - wow. You just don't watch the movie-you experience it! It's worth every penny!"
3,LARGE 8555101 Mallory Distributor,"This a a very large distributor, and will require an air cleaner that is no larger than 12"" in diameter. Also may interfere with the heater hose outlet fitting on the intake manifold. Instructions are very limited in respect to making adjustments to the mechanical advance curves (no graphs or charts), and no instructions on how to adjust the vacuum advance."
4,Dunk By: David Lubar,"Robert Dias Mod 2Book ReviewDunk is about Chad who is a kid that wants to be the bozo in the dunk tank on the Boardwalk. The real bozo is a guy named Malcolm who helps Chad threw out the book even though Chad hates him. Towards the end of the book Malcolm and Chad become good friends, and Chad gets to be the bozo.My favorite part of the book is when Chad becomes the bozo. He finally gets his chance to get in the tank and let loose at all of the people. When he gets into the tank he freezes and doesn't say anything. Then Malcolm tells him to be bozo and not his self. Then he starts to be a good bozo and attracts a lot of people and he has a lot of fun.I recommend this book for many reasons. This is more of a guy book. I would also recommend it to people who like suspense. Also I would recommend this to people who like comedy. Overall Dunk was a very good book for the most part. In some parts of this book it started to boring, but keep reading because it just gets better."
3,What title??,"Be aware that this tarp is not 10x10 but ends up being 9'6""x9'6"". You don't learn that till you get the package and it states this. Make sure you have plenty of bungee cordes on hand."
1,Live what you preach in song,I happened to be married to Scott Baker for a number of years almost 28 to be exact. He ran off with a friend half his age was ask to step down in his ministry. I find it difficult to listen to this music without thinking about it being just music rather than a spitural journey.Debbie
3,Worthwhile for some new studio recordings,"The first part of this album is cut from a Scorn concert in Rome and features tracks that have already appeared on the album ""Zander"". Well, although I'm really a fan of drummer Mick Harris, I must confess Scorn live isn't very interesting. There are no surprises, and Mick showed only little effort, because he didn't perform tracks with complicated rhythm patterns like ""Wreck shop"" (from ""Zander""). The whole affair rather has the feel of a bootleg record, because the stereo balance is slightly shifted to the left channel and the sound sometimes is distorted. The second part of this cd contains four new studio recordings. All in all, ""Whine"" is a bit superficial, and you'd be better off with buying ""Zander""."
3,Mellow and dramatic,"Though this cannot completely evade the trappings of elevator-chic for its new age, soft-hued production, Matsui does transform a fair share of potentially sappy songs into bold melodic statements with an added jazz instinct."
1,Whisper from mirror,Very very disapointed . Not as good as Full Moon --- or even Dream walk.......... If can get my money back from Best Buy.... :-(
5,There are no borders here!,"To paraphrase an early album title by Keiko Matsui. She simply continues to evolve as an artist and composer. This CD is just breathtaking at times, with songs such as ""Between the Moons"" (you will not easily forget the synth/piano riff) and ""Torches On the Earth"" featuring her exquisite touch on the keys. Jazz? New Age? Pop? Who cares. It is simply wonderful instrumental music with both intelligence and heart that you can really get into."
5,An outstanding collection of musical beauty!,"Matsui's eleventh release continues her progression as an artist. Rather than conforming to the formulaic smooth jazz genre, she continues to cut a path uniquely her own. Some may criticize this release for not sounding enough like her previously popular CDs, but that misses the point, as she continues to stretch herself as both a composer and musician. This release is a stunning collection of art, featuring rich melodies and progressions centered on the acoustic piano. The jazziest piece, a four-hand collaboration with Bob James titled ""Ever After"", alone is worth the price of the CD. Her music here is rich in emotion, feeling, depth, spirituality and beauty -- in short, a compelling example of ""Matsui-music""."
1,creamer,This was something I had looked for everywhere so when I found it I was so happy. The product is not adequate. It leaks down the side every time we used it. Finally through it out and bought a better one.
5,ANCHOR HOCKING,I HAVE USED IT YET WAITING TO MOVE BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT IT WAS AWESOME AND CAN NOT WAIT TO START USEING IT
5,Backflip,"I love Backflip! Never a boring moment. My favorites have to be Mountain Windsong and The Salmon Song. Arigon Starr truely knows how to tell a story in song. I can tell she writes and sings her words with true conviction, two elements that always draw me to an artist.Can't wait until the next CD. Arigon Starr, you just get better and better!"
4,Extreme Noise Terror brings a tear to my eye,"Extreme Noise Terror make beautiful music. . .seriously. They do; it so happens that this music is beautifully brutal and fast. This album is a classic that will live on and continue to rock throughout the years. Light a candle, throw some rose petals on your bed, and let Extreme Noise Terror rip you a new one. . .romantically speaking. Keep on rockin' homies."
4,A great present for your pagan cat-lover friend.,"This is a cute little book that will make a great present for your pagan cat-lover friend. It has a lot of feline lore, several spells and recipes, but if you need an in-depth study on cat magick, keep searching."
3,"Great bait, but left without the mouse","I couldn't wait to get this book in the mail. It sounded like a great book, and I read it the night I got it. I enjoyed the stories of cats, and the astrological part on cats. I found that there wasn't enough material to practically apply in today's age with one's own cat. The histories presented did not flow, they jumped around in era and subject, sometimes feeling like the same ground was being covered twice. Although I enjoyed the astrology part, it was rather trite. The most frustrating part of the book is the lack of information on the pictures featured. There are some truly fascinating, fabulous pictures in this book, most lacking any explanation or reference. I found that to be very distracting and a big let down. I hope for a revision in the future, as a book like this, done properly, is needed."
3,Unfortunate fodder,"Although this is a beautifully written and illustrated narrative of an important issue (child slavery and forced labor) it is completely inappropriate for young children. I want to bring that to buyers' attention, because they may perceive it as being a picture book and therefor for young children-it is not. As well, with so few books about Pakistan for young children, it is unfortunate that negative aspects of the culture are brought to market before books that would foster positive self-identity in Paki-American children and teach multiculturalism. Imagine this is the only book presented to a class of children, what sort of message are they getting about Pakistan??? Pakistanis are child exploiters AND murders, period."
4,Wow. 4.5 stars. INTENSE!,"This book (like the previous ones) is VERY INTENSE. But very good. I read it, then imediately turned right around and started back on my favorite chapters (about ch4 to the end). I blew off an entire day reading and rereading it (about 2.5 times before I finally put it down). I hate to see the trilogy end. Maybe Ms Bishop would do us the favor of more books. Maybe set a generation in the future? I am going to go read the Invisible Ring now.My scale: 1 star=don't bother; 2 star=get it from the library and don't waste your cash; 3 stars=a nice read, get it from the library or buy it; 4 stars=read it, buy it. 5 stars=A must. BUY IT, READ IT (several times!)"
4,Queen Of The Darkness,Wow what an ending to a great trilogy! I grew to luv this family that at some ponts in this book I wanted to pitch this book at the wall!! I continued none the less to read and wasn't disapointed with Anne Bishop's talent to captivate my interest. I ordered more black jewel books the instant I put it down!
5,"Lovely end to the trilogy, but a bit of a cliffhanger...","Anne Bishop is a marvelously gifted writer, and I recommend this entire series to any who enjoy the fantasy genre. Predictably fascinating, Queen of the Darkness is an intriguing conclusion to the tale woven by her two previous novels. However, the end was rather puzzling: the entire reconstruction of the three realms in a reformed Blood society was left off the end of the story. I have no room to criticize, as I have not written anything even remotely as worthwhile myself, but I don't believe the tale has truly ended. Perhaps this merely encourages the reader's private imagination, allowing each individual to draw his or her own conclusions. Regardless, the book was magnificent, and I recommend it highly."
3,Not enough...,"The first two books of the series were captivating - and impossible to put down. The third book was equally captivating, but several hundred pages too SHORT! If the author intends to follow this trilogy up with another one, then leaving so much dangling might be a good idea.However, if this is the last we will see of the characters in the series, then this book was a terrible dissapointment. Perhaps the ""Twilight Jewel"" series is upcoming?"
2,I wanted to beat my head against the wall.,"The series started out wonderfully. What happened? Anne Bishop has lost any talent she may have had. Her characters have become boring and unbelivable, the heroine's pretentious ""all-powerfulness"" is distastful, and the plot fizzled and died somewhere on page 6. If you haven't started reading the series, don't. Read ""The Invisable Ring"" instead."
4,"Nice ""conclusion"" to the series.","I say ""conclusion"" because the complex world which Anne Bishop has created calls for more investigation. I do hope she is considering other books beyond these three and ""The Invisible Ring"". Same basic complaints that hetereosexuality is viewed negatively in many ways, especially a woman's first sexual encounter. Also I do not like how quickly she jumps from one scene and character to another, often spending only a page on a scene then far too many details on another section. It was difficult to feel much for the ""bad characters"" and even though should capture our feelings to a degree. However, the the plots are consistant, the world is complex and interesting. I enjoyed the fact that there is no real happy ending, because in such a world it is doubtful own concept of ""happy"" could be found. If you've read the first two and want to know what happens, then this will answer some of your questions but not all."
4,Well worth reading,"I picked up the series after all three books were out and found it very satisfying from start to finish. To my surprise, this isn't fantasy's standard ""poor scullery boy finds out he's really a prince and rises to defeat evil"" plot. The series is refreshing and new in that aspect, while also offering a more dark and erotic landscape. I loved it! I hope Ms. Bishop offers more lore in the same genre."
4,*pout*,"I really did like this book. Really, I did. But I still have a few qualms about it. Actually, not just this book in particular, but for the entire trilogy itself. Okay, Surreal finally has more appearances. That's good. But you would think that after saving Jaenelle's life (_Daughter of the Blood_) the family would show more deference or be more grateful. I mean, Surreal makes a lot of things happen. But no one seems to notice. Lucivar is married. In _Heir to the Shadows_ you grew fond of Lucivar. You cared about what was to become of him. Then he gets married. This supposed ""love of his life"" POPS! out of nowhere! Who is she? Where did she come from? How did they meet? Her personality? Huh? Well? ...."
4,A satisfying end to the trilogy,"Queen of the Darkness was a good read, and it finishes the Black Jewel Trilogy in a way that does not leave the reader in a sense of being betrayed. It was good final book, but I feel myself forced to say that the first book - Daughter of the Blood - was better, and darker, in a way.Anne Bishop manages to maintain her characters. They change, of course, but in a way that is understanable and they are still the same people. Especially Daemon, I feared she would leave the Sadist in the Twisted Kingdom, which happily didn't happen. I like that cruel person, he is so much more then the ordinary stereotypes in most fantasy books.Oh, it is not a good idea to read only one of the series. They belong together and it is unlikely that this one is understood without the other two, and it would be a pity to miss them anyway."
5,A great finish for a great trilogy,"Oh. I do love this series so much - I wish there was more to the ending! And it was a long wait until the series continued, but at least it has continued beyond these initial three in this world. Over the course of the trilogy, I really fell in love with nearly all of the characters (even the villains are rather fun to read about), and to have it just end here -though technically satisfying, is rather heartbreaking, so I am so excited to see the series continue!"
4,I want more!!,"I know that this was only a trilogy, but by the end of the book, I wanted to know what happened next. Heketah and Dorothea are able to connive their way into forcing Jaenelle to make a decision about who she is and what she wants. Jaenelle's birth family has some hard decisions to make about their expectations. I loved seeing the interaction between Surreal, Lucivar, Saetan, and Daemon. There were moments at the beginning that broke my heart, and moments that I was cheering for the characters.This was a good book to end the series with--many things that were mentioned in the other two books were finished off here. I really felt that the ending left me hanging. But there was a lead in (kind of) to the book ""The Invisible Ring."" I will probably read that book soon.There were storylines that could have been developed more, but the love story between Daemon and Jaenelle was very well written. I would highly recommend the entire series to anyone."
3,endings,"I will try not to give away any spoilers, I promise. The first time I read this series, I didn't like the ending. The second time around, I 'got it', and the reasons I didn't like the ending went away. It is, in my opinion, the worst of the series, but the endings of trilogies are usually tough.Over time I've come to like this series less and find it more problematic. I will probably give my copies away or sell them."
4,Be Forwarned,"Be Forwarned, this was an ""interesting"" book. However, while I didn't read the other reveiws and do not care to, you should know about the SEXUALLY EXPLICIT maayerial this book contains. The mortar of the book is inapropriate material. I don't know who you are, however, since I found this book in the teens section of the library , I felt you should know what you getting into."
5,Beautiful,"_Queen of the Darkness_ is a wonderful conclusion to the best dark fantasy trilogy I've ever read. Jaenelle has come into her full power, and her consort Daemon has returned from the Twisted Kingdom. They and Jaenelle's family and friends must fight against Dorothea SaDiablo's evil, possibly at grave cost to them and all of the Blood. Very highly recommended."
5,A wonderful set of books,"I really enjoyed all three novels in this series and I devoured them in about a week. I'm ready to start over and read them again because they were such an exciting adventure the first time.However I feel the same way about the last book that others have mentioned....What happened with Janelle and Daemon? Was Janelle able to heal Saeton so that he could go back to Sylvia? What's with the new jewel that Janelle has? What's so special about it? Does she still have a court? What about Karla? I still have so many questions that were left unanswered the list just goes on and on.Also like others who have written a review on this book I found the other two far more engaging, I would still recomend the trilogy to anyone looking for a good read and lot's of laughs even with the darkness in the books.I just hope that the author will consider writing one more book to tie up the loose ends.All in all they are worth the read!"
2,Disappointed!,"Ms. Bishop should either find a new editor or else change publishers. Her third novel and, one can only assume the conclusion of the Dark Jewels trilogy, was rushed, choppy, facile and altogether disappointing.Let me be clear: I adored the first book, enjoyed the second, and looked forward to this one for months. Perhaps I set my expectations too high. But the strength of her characters and storyline in the first two seemed to promise a terrific climax. Unfortunately, while there was a whisper of the former glory, the third book has left me feeling cheated. Where is some sort of resolution for the various beloved characters? What the heck kind of ending was that last chapter? How dare Ms. Bishop give her devoted readers such a facile conclusion! I know she could have done far better, and that's what hurts; to imagine what might have been!"
5,Loved it!,"I've read this book twice and I imagine I'll be reading it again. The first two books are great but this one is a whole new species. Daemon and Jaenelle are finally reunited and after maybe a rough start they're hot (without being vulgar)! The battle you've been waiting for finally comes to a head but it's not the usual good verses evil crap. Bishop proves how original she can be, with lots of twists and an ending that blows you away."
4,Well......,"When I read Daughter of the Blood, I got hooked into the series. I thought Heir to the Shadows was excellent as well. But after reading this book, the ending kind of dissapointed me. Most of the stuff in between was good (I loved the scene where Daemon tricks Hekatah and Dorothea. Very Sadist-like of him!). The ending really didn't make sense to me though. So Jaenelle shatters her Jewels, but saves the Blood. But what's the purpose of the Twilight's Dusk Jewel? Does this mean that she's now stronger than Ebony, or weaker than White? I don't know, it was just very dissapointing."
1,Poor detail about product.,I ended up withCosequin for small dogs instead of for large dogs. Being a first time buyer I didn't know the difference in labels but now I do. They need to specify that somewhere. It's not worth the shipping charges I have to pay to send this back.
1,Music obscures narration,As it says on the back cover track 1 is supposed to be a SPOKEN-word visualization.The music is so loud I could not hear the narration therefore it is of no use to me. Haven't messrs MeditationsForLife checked the audio quality before selling it?
3,Body of secrets doesnt add much over puzzle palace,"I read Bamford's ""Puzzle Palace"" a couple of years ago and was fascinated. ""Body of Secrets"" falls flat compared to its predecessor. While Puzzle really unravelled many layers off the NSA puzzle, this book is drab and full of boring detail. There is good coverage of the USS Liberty and Pueblo incidents but again in too much detail. He goes into pages and pages of how directors dealt with members of congress etc. There is some duplication of content with Puzzle Palace also. Overall, I felt let down by Bamford compared to his previous effort. If you havent read it yet, buy or borrow Puzzle Palace. Skip this one."
4,Good Book Turned Okay,"Thank you to James Bamford for taking an interest in the NSA, which is seldom talked about, aka ""No Such Agency"". I found the book a good read in most places. However, the book gets banal with lengthy details of step-by-step attacks and lots of equipment descriptions. Honestly, the book is 600 pages (100 pages of biblography) the book should have been around 300 pages.Also, I think Bamford does an excellent job with the titles of the chapters, relating to the human body (brain, blood, etc). That certailny gives an over-view as to what the chapter will contain.Overall, I think it's a good book and worth it, if you skim over the less-intersting pages. Now I feel like i'm on the ground walking and the NSA is in a tall buidling, watching us like ants."
4,A ringing indictment v. the Establishment War Machine!,"The author, an intelligence expert, haswritten this book on the National Secur-ity Agency that contains a lengthy andvery detailed section on the Israeli at-tack on the USS Liberty, the 41st anniv-ersary of which has just past. It showsthat Israel clearly, deliberately inflic-ted the brutal assault on the 172 mancrew that killed 34 of the US sailors, 5of which were jewish Amer-I-cans! Israel,the UN'S 'lil pet country, has a terriblehuman rights record since 1948. It is usuallynot easy to find such frank discussion by anestablished figure on these matters, but aut-hor Bamford lets it all hang our for the pub-lic to see. Pick up on this winner!"
3,Body of Secrets,"The accounts of cold war incidents like the attack on the USS Liberty read like a good novel. Also , very interesting are the more documentary segments about some of the clandestine activities of people like Ariel Sharon. I found the small errors of fact like his references to .50 caliber machine guns on the Liberty as 50 mm machine guns mildly annoying in a book purporting to uncover the truth of many secret activites. All in all it's an informative and interesting book worth the reading."
3,Too much irrelevant filler,"The book has some very good sections, especially the technical stuff.But it has two annoyances. The book harps too often on the agency's lack of EEOC compliance as if political correctness should trump its mission. The other problem is the last chapter that describes 9/11. It is little more than a chronological rehash of the day's events with almost nothing that relates specifically to the NSA."
2,Not up to par with The Puzzle Palace,"This book just didn't live up to my expectations. Outside of the in-depth material on the USS Liberty, and some interesting discussion about NSA activities in Southeast Asia, there really isn't much energy in this book.To me, the best material here really is in the last few chapters; chapters I fear that many folks won't even get to if they focus their energies reading the ""revelations"" about the USS Liberty. The chapter on ""Crypto City"" is quite interesting, as was the last chapter about NSA and development of new electronic and computer technology.I guess that I was really looking for a history of NSA activities in those two areas, building on the strengths of Bamford's earlier book, The Puzzle Palace. To find the discussion of the NSA's real physical anatomy, and their important role in the development of new technologies, relegated to the concluding chapters of this book was a disappointment."
2,Compelling but Misguided,"Horribly exaggerated by a journalist that tries to present personal insight as historical fact. He makes outrageous allegations that are wildly misguided and unproven. He is persuasive in his arguments, which make his assertions even more dangerous and outright foolishness.It is a compelling read. Just be careful what you perceive as storytelling, what is attempted journalism, and what is fact."
3,"More history than ""anatomy""","The title of this book in pretty misleading. The ""anatomy"" of the NSA isn't really the focus until the final 25% of the book, the rest is mostly on the history of the various activities of the agency. Still, this is a mighty ambitious and impressive volume that I found fairly engrossing in places (especially the harrowing attack on the USS Liberty by Israel in 1967). I learned a bunch, but I'd say this one is best suited to military history and espionage buffs. Definitely more info than I needed."
2,Could of been better,"This book had interesting tibits of information. However, there were several points that were in error. Such as the description of the cockpit layout of a RB47. I felt to much time was taken pointing out what ""Body of Secrets"" had uncovered rather than providing facts or telling a story."
5,Tip of the iceberg,This is a good book but not as good as Puzzle Palace in that it is not as comprehensive. Just the mention that NSA contracted with the Educational Testing Service has been overlooked because ETS is the basis of our education system with its standardized tests.One way NSA may decide on candidates also is by having teachers or college professors vote by the grade given to a student for potential NSA recruitment where majority grades of a certain level form the vote itself. How do we know the whole MCSE certification and other computer industry certs are not actually NSA qualified and rigged because social security numbers are used to identify exam takers?
1,He is politically biased and shows it.,"I worked in this area in a peripheral way for many years. Bamvord didn't go into details because he did not know any. I was disappointed in most of the book. His little political asides smacked of Democrat talking points. He could have covered the downsizing of intelligence gathering during the Clinton administration, but didn't. I enjoyed reading about Crypto City and the references to Seymour Cray and the super computers. All of the two hundred references cited here saved the book from being a total loss.There could be a great book on this subject but this wasn't it."
2,Mind numbing,"Although some of the historical events covered in the book should lend themselves to the thrilling type of stuff other reviews seem to say exists, I find the whole book as boring as it must be to sit for hours eavesdropping on meaningless conversations. Its interesting to learn how electronic eavesdropping is done for about 100 pages then........"
1,"Bamford does not ""get it""",I had a difficult time distinguishing fact from fiction as Bamford most certainly authored this with a biased view. It wasn't even worth finishing.
2,Biased and Disorganized,"The author's anti-establishment bias shows in every chapter. The book has no logical organization, no evident chapter themes, no structural consistency, no recognized method of citation for source material."
2,A Hard Read,"There is no question the author did a hugh amount of research. I enjoyed the first quarter of the book. After that it got tedious with too much information, much of it unimportant except to experts in the field, and a seemingly slanted view that our government and the people in codebreaking committed wrongdoing. Too many of his interviews were with people who had an axe to grind. I stopped reading it with a quarter of the book remaining."
5,Castro and the United States,"I wish I had the e-mail address of the author , James Bamford. I would tell him the following: If every other story is as accurate as yor portion covered in Chapter 5 on the secret activities of the Castro Government with our Government just before the assasination of President Kennedy, this book is a very, very historical book. To confirm this, the book ""Secret Missions to Cuba : Fidel Castro, Bernardo Benes and Cuban Miami"" is a historical testimony of the statement made by a diplomat from Guinea to our UN Official, William Atwood ( page 129 ) on Fidel Castro's willigness and desire for a reproachment with Washington, D.C.. And this was in 1963, almost 40 years ago."
3,Intimate details ...,"About a Gary Powers flight on a U2 the author states:""His long underwear was soaked with perspiration.""No source quoted ;-)If you can stand this way of writing, then go on and read it"
3,Body of Secrets in Need of a Good Editor,"The author presents many little known secrets of the inner workings of espionage, code-breaking, scheming and such in and around the National Security Agency. It is very informative and enlightening but the book could have used a good editing to tighten up and streamline the author's tendency to digress into minutae."
1,A very negative book,"Bamford must have some something out for the NSA. He is extemely negative in his approach to just about everything they do and all the personalities involved. After 400 pages I gave up trying to deal with it. I am sure they aren't perfect, have made their share of mistakes, as well as there were people that had their own agendas. But I have to believe that there must have been some huge victories and that there are some terrific people who have contributed significantly to this country's successes. It would have been a much better book if he had tried to balance it.Would welcome others thoughts at arnie@impact-ep.com"
4,Thorough account of the NSA,"Bamford has trod important ground by presenting a fully-realized essay on the NSA. There are, of course, holes of information and areas where the author's viewpoint is asserted, but these should be considered within the remarkable achievement of the whole. Bamford has dared to deliver a single volume text on an organization whose currency is secrets. That he at times maintained an objective and exhaustive stance is worthy of recognition. For fans of espionage and the real-world uses of cryptography in the intelligence community, this book delivers on the promise to reveal the nuts and bolts of the NSA. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author ""Race Against Evil."""
1,Extremely biased,"About what you'd expect from the producer of ABC World News Tonight With Peter Jennings and someone who wrote stories for the New York Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times magazines. If you love these news sources you'll probably love the book's bias. If not, you probably won't finish it once your tolerance level for the following is reached: bashing of Republican presidents; bashing of our country's intelligence and security agencies; apologizing for Democratic presidents' blunders."
2,Brutal,"As intriguing as a lot of the subject matter is, this was a terribly written book in my opinion and i think two stars is really stretching it. Some of the historical incidents were interesting, but i really don't find descriptions of the offices, parking lots, sewage systems, etc. of the NSA very engrossing. This is a an example of how a good idea translated into a boring, hard to digest book."
4,A good read,"This book is sort of like Bamford's Inside the Puzzle Palace. Some of the events are covered in both books (that is why i give it 4 stars instead of 5). All in all, its a good read and the slow parts are kept to a minimum."
2,Comprehensive information packaged into poor writing.,"As with Bamford's ""Puzzle Palace"", if you want information on the NSA, ""Body of Secrets"" is one of the few comprehensive books you'll find. Unfortunately, Bamford needs to learn how to write. Chapters are chaotic. He even includes entire chapters that have nothing to do with the NSA! Grammatical problems abound. I'm surprised it was published in such a state of disarray. Nevertheless, you will marvel at Bamford's voluminous and generally objective information on this fascinating agency."
2,Interesting But Uneven,"The NSA is a great subject for an investigative journalist. Bamford unearths some fascinating material, but overall the book is a mess. There are too many abrupt shifts in tone and theme, from outraged polemics on the Liberty and Pueblo incidents to dry accounts of bureaucratic structures and breathless you-are-there reconstructions of Cold War exploits. As a result, the book is often intriguing but rarely satisfying. Bamford has a few obvious axes to grind, but his overall take on the NSA is elusive."
1,Does not work with mice that are both PS/2 and USB capable,"This PS/2 Extender will only work with a mouse that has ONLY a PS/2 connector. The extender will not work with any of the mice that have both USB and PS/2 capability, where the mouse has a USB connector with a USB to PS/2 adaptor to provide PS/2 capability. This means that the extender will not work with most of the mice on the market today.This information comes from the Gefen Inc. technical help line, and is their explanation as to why I can't use this extender with my Microsoft Intellimouse Optical USB and PS/2 compatible mouse."
3,Gets the job done,"These sockets will get the job done, but they seem kind of flimsy. For a regular homeowner, who will use it only a few times, it's OK, but if you're some kind of professional, I'd look for something else."
1,"Short, short, short","If I buy a 50 foot wire, I expect it to be 50 feet long. This wire is 44 feet long and I am annoyed and disappointed. I don't really care about the sound quality if the wire won't get to my speakers."
1,Terrible Customre service...,"Amazing-gone..product took 8 weeks to get to me door.!! amazon listed product available first, then NEVER notified me they cound NOT DELIVER and then after i called they would only ship standard mail which took FOR..EVER!!!!BE WARN! ALWAYS ASK FOR OVER NIGHT DELIVERY when dealing with their ""so call customer service""!"
3,Product is short,"This is good inexpensive wire the rolls are just short. I had 5 rolls and they were all 3-7' short of 50'. If you need a 50' run get something else, if you need 7 6' runs this will fit the bill. Wire was of good quality and I was able to finish my product after getting some additional wire."
2,This is less than 50 Feet and its aluminum.,This wire is not copper and its not 50 feet but it is 14 gauge. I believe one strand is copper clad while the other is just aluminum. 14 gauge copper clad speaker wire from RCA or Philips is a better buy because they are actually 50 feet and both strands are clad in copper and they are also cheaper in price. I would not buy this product again.
3,Wire,"I dont know, its your basic wire, *as noted by others the spool was short , not sure by how much, but at least 5 ft. Im having trouble with volume through this wire, and its only going to a 6 inch speaker in my jeep door ( so no lack of gauge). Really it could be a number of things not related to the wire.Ill have to test it out on something else. In the event i figure this out i will update."
5,Better than Factory installed unit,"I have used a factory installed navigation system in my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a year; and have found the Navman icn 630 I purchased for my other vehicles to be less confusing and faster to re-route; I surmise it is because the Navman does not have a hard drive as in the Jeep. Also, the Navman map is less confusing to follow because of the 3D feature that automatically displays when approaching a turn. Another great feature is the ability to update your maps at no charge by downloading from the Navman site. Most factory systems require the purchase of a new DVD or set of CD's to replace obsolete or incomplete map data.The Navman unit is ruggedly built, the display is very clear and bright. A great value at approximatey 1/3 the price of a factory unit."
2,Needs improvement,"After doing a lot of research I settled to buy this unit. The ... rebate was attractive as well. Unfortunately I had to return it.Pros:1. Excellent screen and easy to use.2. Route recalculation is fast.3. Mounting bracket included along with a carry case.4. Uses non-proprietary CF cards, limited to 256MB CF usable card data although you can use larger capacity card for storageCons:1. Limited memory, 64MB built in + 256MB CF card.2. No data for Canada yet.3. In my testing it avoided major highways for in-city travel thus adding additional 20-30 mins to travel time.4. It would at times end 200ft before reaching the target.I did speak with tech support who stated an upgrade is in progress for release in Jan 04 which would include Canadian maps.I am now thinking about the Magellan Roadmate 700."
1,NAVMAN IS RUN BY SLUGS,Do not buy from Navman. Bad company. Bad products. Bad supoort. BAD BAD BAD!!!
4,True,"I think Amy Goldman Koss kept true to what girls do today, but to make it even more interasting she added some of her own material in. It was neat to see how these five girls dealt with there own problems, but still keeping a cool front when with there friends. Maya was being a real nice person to take all the hits Candace and the other girls made her face. I hope with out giving anything away but Making you interasted in to reading ""The Girls"" By:Amy Goldman Koss"
3,''The Girls'',The Girls is a very realistic book about cliques and friend groups in junior high. I thought it was an O.K. book. I think the author should have made it longer and more interesting. I liked ho Maya realizes that Candace isn't her real friend. I also liked it the way that Darcy gets left out at the end. This book has the potential for a great sequel. Iwould recommend this book to someone who is looking for a short realistic book.
2,This book has no plot!,"I found this book in my 11 year-old sister's room, and thought it looked interesting. Boy was I wrong! This book can be confusing to follow because each chapter is writted from another character's point of view. Not only does this book have so weak a plot that it seems to be non-existent, but the portrayel of the four teenage girls who are the main characters is totally false! The plot in this book is so unbelievable! I wouldn't waste your money on this book. If you desperatly want to read this book, then borrow it from the library, but do not spend your own money on it!"
1,fluff,"This book was awful. The story was predictable, cliched and poorly written. The writing was by far the worst part -- it was very immature. This sounded like something my middle school students might have written. Giving books like these to young adults is demeaning to their intelligence, especially when there are so many great authors out there who write well and address the relationship issues that are important to young teenage girls. I would never recommend this to my students."
2,"Short, but very true&#65533;","Maya's a member of a middle-school clique, until one day, when their ""leader"" decides to ditch her. Maya's confusion, along with three of the other girls in the clique's emotions are explored in short chapters that switch back and forth from one girl to another. What emerges is a sad, but very true picture of how cliques function and how girls treat their ""friends."" My main gripe with this book was that it was far too short and read more like a short story than a novel. I wish that the characters had been expanded a bit more, but maybe by keeping it short, the author was trying to prove a point."
5,One of the best books ever!,"This book was so good. It was kinda suspenseful in a way because you just don't know what is going to happen next(it's not predictable.) It is a page-turner because you just can't stop reading it, you just want to know what happens page after page. Every girl should love this book, it is about something that might happen in life, you get kicked out of a group and feels like Maya(the girl in the book that gets kicked out of a group that she has been in awhile with Candace,Brianna,Renee,and Darcy.) You should REALLY buy this book and read it!!!!!!!!!!! Hope this was helpful."
4,"good, pretty realistic","its good, really realalistic. girls will do anything for popularity.it took a little long to get to the end, b/c each chapter is about a different girl, through her eyes.candance is a total bitch!hahahabut yeah good over all*definatly worth my time*"
4,Love This Book,"Even though this book is a little confusing because you go between 4 girlz in each chapter, really liked it."
4,The Girls Review,"""The Girls"" is a book about a group of five girls: Maya, Cadance, Brinna, Renne, and Darcy. All the sudden these girls start to exclude Maya. They especially be mean to her when Dracy has a sleepover and Cadance, the leader of the group who Darcy will do anything for, tells Darcy not to invite Maya and they call her and say some very mean things about her and her family.I LOVED this book very much, it was very interesting but I think it could of had more action in it.This book kept me surprised and intersted the whole way through."
4,the clique,"Since I am 18 yrs old, this book was a little bit young for me but it won more than one award so I decided that it was worth my time. The book shows the members of a clique from each individuals perspective. The book is a little bit juvinile but it shows the troubles that preteens face- divorce, the want for acceptance and watching their parents age."
3,The Girls Review,"The Girls consist of Maya, Renee, Candace, and Brianna. All of a sudden the 4 girls decided not to be friends with Maya, leaving her to wonder why they don't like her anymore.The book wasn't very detailed. It didn't even tell where it took place. It was hard for me to stay focused because I kept forgetting who the characters were or getting them mixed up, and not knowing who did what in the book. Personally, there were just too many girls to keep track of.However, I think a lot of girls can relate to it or atleast understand the concept. It wasn't horrible. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone just young girls like my neice because she is 13 and going in to middle school. Younger girls would maybe like it more."
5,Popularitical Politics,"This book was amazing. I thought it was really interesting and it reminds me girls I know throughout my school. Despite some views on this book, it truly is good.It's all about five girls in the best clique: Candance, Darcy, Renee, Brianna and Maya. When Maya's dumped by Candance (Queen B.), she's stuck with sadness and despair. The others just go along with it but get dumped one by one by Candance anyway. Except the gullible and best friend, Darcy. She is scared of being left by Candance. By the end of the story, Candance has already thought about putting together another group of a popular fivesome of blondes including the new girl, with ""cool hair"", Nicole.This book has major deals on popularity, gossip, dreams, friends and other good middle school subjects."
4,A page turner,"This was a totally realistic book about a junior high school clique. Popular Candace and her followers have turned against Maya, a former member of the group. What has Maya done to deserve this? Most of the group, including Maya, doesn't even know. The book just pulls you into this world where social status is important and fragile. You keep turning pages to see what will happen next. I read it in a few hours."
4,serious girl power,"Pai, a 12-year old Maori girl in remote New Zealand, is raised by her deeply angry grandfather who wants to pass on the traditions of his tribal culture and history, but must face the realities of a modernizing world. But the tables are turned when Pai teaches him and becomes the new leader. Exquisite scenery and a powerful story, I took my teenage daughter and girlfriends after seeing it with my wife."
3,Cultural Movie,Very interesting movie about the culture. My grandchildren got bored until dancing and ocean scenes. Not really for children under age 15.Some profanity. A little hard to understand.
3,Not what I expected,"The movie IS good. Castle-Hughes did do a good job. I simply didn't realize that the ""whale riding"" only happened in the last 15 minutes. I spent the whole movie going ""Ok, speed this up,,,talking talking talking.....we GET it, he's upset she's a girl!!""The scene where Paikea cries on stage because the grandfather isn't there to see her is very sad though.I wonder why it wasn't set a hundred years ago or so though. Too bad the ""island people"" weren't in more ethnic looking garb (sorry, I loved Apocolypto for that reason) and so many of the actors having british rather than ""polynesian"" accents kind of threw off the authenticity too. For me anyway."
2,Whale Rider,I can't believe how overrated this movie is.This movie has nothing going for it except the cinemontography.I thought this would be a feel good movie but it proved otherwise.
5,An elixir of magic and medicine-Whale Rider,"A small movie with the heart of an ocean.A movie that doesn't try to say anything,yet delivers a message of a lifetime.Simple yet profound, mystical, magical,inspirational, and universal.Takes us on a journey all of our soulshave been longing for, even praying for.It doesn't try to change our life,it just reaffirms it. It doesn't yellor shout at us, yet our whole entity quiverswith it's song.This is a movie of the ages for all ages.It's a tearjerker, but not in the traditionalsense. It's empowering, inspiring andilluminating.This truly is an elixir for any person'sheart and soul. Do yourself a favor,put down that Prozac and buy yourself a ticket to ""Whale Rider.""Don't let this one pass you by.Mark Tusher"
5,Whale Rider,"Visually breathtaking and emotionally uplifting, ""Whale Rider"" is a must-see for the whole family. Castle-Hughes is a gifted actress who manages to convey both age-appropriate longings and a mystical aura as 12-year-old Pai, defying generations of tribal tradition to achieve her proper destiny. Rawiri Paratene is excellent as Koro, Pai's grandfather and the chief of the tribe, whose stubborn pride prevents him from seeing her gifts. An ode to an enduring myth of the New Zealand Maoris, ""Whale Rider"" is an ethereal film that stays with you."
2,Great Cinematography but not Demanding Enough Story Line,"02/01/06 The basic of the story ""Whale Rider"" would be most appealing to those intrigued by cinematograpy..the story line about the ""long line of male descendants"" to the original ""leader"" washed up on the shores thanks to his ride on a whale"" and thus becoming the New Zealand indigenous peoples""s leader finally ending with a girl , and how girls can ""mentally & physically equal boys"" , so why not ""a Woman Leader"" ends how you would have expected to end & gives a few suspense filled moments ."
3,Not as good as promised,"While this movie has several good points, it lacks creativity in many areas. You watch the movie and then leave with several questions about the culture left unanswered. Perhaps because I kept hearing how good the movie was I expected more, but I did not get it. Keisha's performance was wonderful and so were the perfomances of the other actors, the story is simly lacking. It's a shame because this movie could have been so much more than it turned out to be. The scenery is beautiful, the music is perfect and the acting is superb. It's really too bad.I recommend this movie but it's not one that you'd want to watch more than once."
5,WHALE RIDER,"Whale Rider is a wonderful story that breaks the limitations of gender or age revealing that wisdom can be found in a young girl. Despite what the male elders and tribal community members believe, the ""Whale Rider"" is not at all who or what they expected. This makes for a very intriguing movie with a truly uplifting ending. This movie is excellent both adults and children. It receives my ""two thumbs up""!"
5,A classic!,"I love this movie. It sends a good message about girl power. I don't believe in leaving spoilers, so this review will be very short. I had watched this on television several years ago and fell in love with it. I had a problem finding it in stores. I was so happy to find it on this site. I consider this dvd a beloved classic. It's perfect if you're having a bad day. It is perfect for ages 12 and up. Besides, you may just learn a thing or two about New Zealand's culture."
4,I HEARD THE WHALE CALL MY NAME,"A magnificant little odyssey that will warm the heart with genuine sentiment and delight the senses with gorgeous New Zealand oceanic scenes. Thankfully, this 'feel-good-movie' accomplishes just that through a compelling simple story, wonderful performances, and a high regard for the indigenuous peoples of New Zealand. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as the young girl, even a tear-jerking speech in an emotion packed scene is delivered with great deft and restraint and she has a beautiful singing voice, bringing much clarity and exposure to indigenuous tribal songs. So real was the traumatic beached whales scene that I was scrambling through the end credits to insure no actual whales were harmed, and of course it was all a brilliant special effect. For fans of this film, the DVD offers a ""Making of Whale Rider"" documentary in which cast and crew deservedly talk about the wonder of this beautiful film."
3,Whale Rider,"Good enough movie. My agenda was to learn more about Maori culture. While there were some elements of this culture in the movie, I did not get a sense of what it means to be part of that culture, and that is what I was looking for."
5,Best Movie I have seen in Years!,This is perhaps the most touching movie I have ever seen. You will not be disappointed.
4,Whale rider,A pleasant and spiritual story about customs and the ability of people to believe and embrace change
4,Whale Rider,"I liked Whale Rider as it depicts some of the cultural mores of the Maori people. While simplistic and sometimes slow, the movie does take you on a journey in a girl's life that otherwise would be left for the guys--soon to be men. While the premise of woman doing what a man should do in Maori customs seemed a bit Americanish to me...maybe this indeed is part of the changing culture of the Maori. What made up for this one aspect was the dance and tribal painting, and the whale lore...I recommend this movie to anyone who loves animals and is interested in seeing how other cultures live in the present."
4,Girl Power,"Unlike so many Hollywood movies which like to convey women as ""powerful and independent"", yet still dress them up like barbie dolls, this movie truly shows ""girl power"" in an authentic way. Newcomer, Keish Castle-Hughes role in this movie is truly inspiring for all women and girls. I highly recommend this movie. It will not only inspire you but teach you about a culture that is not often talked about."
4,A star is born,"Whale Rider is named after the mythical ancient chief who was saved from drowning by riding to shore on the back of a whale. This is a classically constructed 21st-century fable of generational and gender conflict in which the old ways compete with progressive ideas and an individual female voice attempts to be heard in a patriarchal society. As the heroine, Pai, Keisha Castle-Hughes is a real find - possessed of a glorious screen face, with her dark unruly hair framing strong features and piercing eyes locked in concentration or scowling at the weight of her destiny. In a film of many delights, her mesmerising performance carries the conviction not just of a natural born leader but of a natural born star."
4,"Good, but Better is Available","""Whale Rider"" is not a typical film in the Hollywood tradition. It has no big name stars, is filmed entirely in New Zealand and often dwells in the darker side of people. Although, having said that, the film does have a happy ending and thus ends on a positive tone.I cannot truly say that I enjoyed the film and although Keisha Castle-Hughes has been nominated for an Oscar as best actress, I think this, in itself, overstates what is a worthy film without ever being great. In fact, although the characters are quite believable, I had some difficulty empathising with them.For Americans, which is where all films try to succeed, I would recommend another New Zealand film as an introduction to this genre. That is, rather than see ""Whale Rider"", try to locate a copy of ""Once were Warriors"". This is gritty film making at its best and the best product to ever come from New Zealand."
2,"overrated, cliche, expected more...","the hype i heard before before watching this movie may have ruined the film for me. i went into the movie with high expectations and left disappointed.its your typical ""girl proves male-dominated-society wrong"" movie full of cliches. nothing original, but very little really is today. the film lost its identity at the end where you are left feeling cheapened by the hollywood ending.even though this movie is probably better than most garbage released today, i could only give it 2 stars mainly because i dont recommend it."
2,"Whale Rider,","Whale Rider is an okay movie. not the best movie i have seen it's okay and it does have a touching story to it. other than that i wouldn't buy it. It's slow & boring for me. but if you like these types of movies it's for you.Plot: Ever since Pieka was born her grandfather has rejected her because she wasn't a boy. Her grandfather is a tribe leader and he needs his grandson to take over for him, but instead he got a granddaughter. Paikea was a twin and her brother died at birth. Now Pikea has to show to her grandfather that she can lead the people and become a great leader. Can she do it, Well you got to rent it and find out.If you liked this movie check out the Soundtrack & Book."
1,How to Endure Abuse and Love Despite It,"<yawn> This is such an old tale. The woman/female is horribly abused merely because she is the ""wrong gender"". She endures it, says nothing, is kind and sweet and thoughtful and forgiving. Finally she gives her life before the sexist macho creep who treats her worse than garbage wakes up. And of course, when he wakes up, he gets a seat of honor right next to her. But I suppose you could forgive the naivete of the main character as she is only 11. She's not grown up and felt her full outrage at such brutal betrayal and constant condemnation based on nothing more than that she was born female."
1,Not Afraid to Give One Star,"This ponderous, vapid, and truly boring film violates almost all the rules that good films seem to follow. Its glowing reviews prove that the ""Emperor's Clothes Syndrome"" is alive and well.There is virtually no tension, few surprises, no excitement, and boring characters from start to finish. From the beginning I knew what would happen to Pai. All the wonder was taken away by this film's nearly immediate predictability. It isn't even that interesting visually.I didn't cry. I didn't laugh. I was not moved one bit. I was relieved that it was over."
5,Best movie I've seen so far this year.,"I cannot say enough good things about this film, which manages to be both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. Keisha Castle-Hughes is a terrific young actress, and the message of the film, that fate can choose great things for you even if no one around you sees them coming, is incredibly touching.I've never seen anything like WHALE RIDER. And, wiping the tears from my eyes after the first viewing, I knew I'd want to share the experience with as many people as possible."
4,Grab the tissues,This film is worth seeing. I cried on and off almost from beginning to end. Very touching story although a little slow.
5,Great work - fast paced and fascinating!,"This movie is a great example of a young girl's moxie and her community benefitting as a result. Also meets my requirements of the characters undergoing a change during the movie - her grandfather completely transforms from a yesterday man to a today man (in terms of gender). Regarding the DVD itself, the deleted scenes were great to see - I always thought they would have been good to be in the movie (except for the terrible one, of course).I look forward to watching this movie whenever things get me down!"
1,misleading,This item is a joke. I only received a pack of 4 rolaids for a total of 23.00. The item pictured is a whole container of 12 rolaids.Do not buy any of these. You will be sorry like I am.
3,"Some good, some bad","While I thoroughly enjoy the first album, I cannot get into the 2nd one. This disc includes the 2nd album ""Universe"" first, which is kinda like a spacey concept album, followed by the self-titled album. As one reviewer stated ""Universe"" is reminiscent of Voivod, I would say very early Voivod, which I have a hard time getting into. The first album is more like old DRI/Nuclear Assault. My biggest gripe is the disc is missing ""Tempest"" from the first album! It's listed, but it's not on the disc. No excuse for that! I had to record that track from cassette."
3,Not Bad-not the greatest,"I am not really a fan of Instant Winner, I basicaly just came across them through garageband.com They sound like your typical Ska band with a dash of punk. If your into ska buy this albulm. You won't regret it but you won't be listening to them until 5AM in the morning. Maybe 3AM. But as I am currently listening to them right now they sounds really good. Buy this albulm. Songs Iv've heard on this albulm are good. They kind of remind me of a toned down version of Less Than Jake."
1,Gilbert and Sullivan......In Tears,"Once again we discover that amatures should not attempt to emulate what the classical artist ""would"" have wanted. This poor attempt at a ""comical"" view of the music of G&S only reiterates to this listener.....Don't Go There... I'm sorry I did and wish that the King's Singers......had never said...""Howdy Do"", to me. Though I will keep searching for a true and respectful rendition of H.M.S. Fortunately, this version, makes a great coffee cup coaster......"
1,Slow and Tedious...,"I was so disappointed in this cd, as I am a true Gilbert and Sullivan fan, and had high expectations of thiscompilation of songs that I have a fond familiarity with. A few of the cuts are pleasant enough, but more ofthem are sung at a snail's pace with ""embellishments"" that make them at times almost unrecognizable. If youenjoy traditional renditions of G&S; tunes, you will want to skip this."
4,A Little Disappointing,"This collection of G&S is a little disappointing, considering it's the King Singer's version, but still worth purchasing. I felt rather lethargic after listening to it, I kept feeling the need to speed things up a bit, a dreamy and soft version of what I feel should be a more lively and impelling musical experience. It didn't reach my soul or insist I sing along, it may be the recording process itself was part of the effect or they felt the need to make a less typical version."
5,casio Men's digitgal databank watch,I wear the watch every day and it does everything I need the watch to do.
5,love it,"I've tried several of the hot/cold waxes available at major drugstores and find this works best. I've used it cold and hot, but find hot best... try dunking it in warm water or sticking it in the microwave for no more than 15 seconds. Washes off easily in hot water. I have very sensitive skin and have never had it cause a rash."
2,"IT SHOULD BE CALLED ""VINTAGE HOMES""","Like many of the other reviewers, I feel compelled to say that since the current editor in chief, Jacqueline DeMontravel took over, the quality and the true essence of the magazine has gone down a long steep hill with no stop signs in sight. The essence has been changed from ""Romantic"" homes to ""Vintage"" homes as it's obvious that Ms. DeMontravel is obsessed with vintage style.For many years I subscribed to the ""old"" Romantic Homes magazine and kept every single issue. I could not part with any of the issues as each issue was packed with gorgeous photos oozing with true romantic style, but all that changed when the current editor took over. Not only did I stop saving every issue, but I chose not renew my subscription.With myself included, there are many readers out there who are hoping for the ""old"" Romantic Homes magazine to return!"
1,"Romantic - No, Amateur-Yes","I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen. That was a bad decision. After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed. The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine."
4,A little magazine that could,"Over the past year, ROMANTIC HOMES has gone through some welcome, beautiful changes. It's a lot more sophisticated -- much less cutesy -- in style, format, design, and editorial content. (I hope this continues, as there's way too much ""country"" out there on our urban newsstands.) The writing in the new ROMANTIC HOMES is stronger and sharper, too; there's clearly a new editorial mission lately, and I hope it continues. As other reviewers mentioned, I have mourned the loss of VICTORIA, and found that this lovely magazine helps fill the void."
3,disappointing lately,"I've loved this magazine since a teenage girl. My mom and I would pore over every isssue and save them all. However, I have been disappointed lately with all the changes. It's just not the same. I have not renewed my subscription because I don't want to waste my money on a magazine of which I only like two pages. I will only buy off the newsstand so as to be sure of liking the issue. I still have all the old issues and read them over and over. I miss the old Romantic Homes!"
1,Not worth it,"I have enjoyed reading Romantic Homes for many years, but lately the style of the magazine has changed. Once you could count on every issue for romantic, whimsical, and lovely decorating and gardening ideas. The 2007 issues, however, have a very muddled style - some articles/photo spreads are starkly modern, or downright pretentious. The Romantic Homes company itself has TERRIBLE customer service. The customer service representatives I've spoken to on the phone barely speak English, and are unable to perform simple tasks like an address change. Letters written to the customer service department receive no response at all. Romantic Homes is definitely not worth my money anymore."
4,Home as sanctuary,I still haven't quite gotten over the demise of Victoria magazine but Romantic Homes has helped. The photography is not as beautiful but the ideas shown offer possibilities an average person (i.e. not wealthy) might incorporate into one's home. At first the designs seemed primarily shabby chic and while there is still a lot of white rooms portrayed more color and variety has improved the spreads. I would like to see more garden articles.
5,An absolute must for business people,"5 Stars is not enough for this excellent book. I read this book for a entrepreneurial course a year ago. However, it was after the end of school that I fell in love with this book. It is truly helpful for anyone with a passion for business and entrepreneurialism.Look for me in the future, Chris Philippi, future CEO.I will be starting a marketing consulting firm based in Northern NJ soon. Be on the lookout, this book has that kind of influence."
4,Extremely Comfortable!,"For a 7.5 months preganat lady, I will say these tongs are fab.( I don't recommend wearing heels whilst pregnant though). They were just so comfortable that I had no problems wearing them at all. One major dissapointment was when it arrived, it looked rather different from how it appears in the photo. On comfort, I'll give the tongs a 4.2 out of 5. On looks, I'll give it a 3."
5,Must've Ran Out Of Episodes,"This anthology includes a novella Spock Must Die, and I guess it's because they ran out of episodes to recreate. I don't remember off hand if there was any episodes left. I don't remember reading Shore Leave. But for whatever reason this novella was included, and this makes it the least of the four Star Trek Readers, since it seems to not fit, but it's still adequate Star Trek fare."
5,Satisfying historical fantasy romance,"The book is based loosely on the legend of King Arthur, and set during the reign of Henry Plantagenet (1154-1189). The idea is that Merlin has become an old hermit, living in secrecy in an ancient forest. A cruel and abusive lord murders his wife, and in revenge Merlin curses the lord's wife to give birth to a blind albino boy. The plot follows this boy, Mallory, from his tortured childhood until he grows to manhood, learns to fight and reclaim his estate. Oh yes, and he falls in love with Merlin's daughter.If you like a tortured hero romance, this is a good one. If you like romances featuring a blind hero, this one is highly recommended"
5,Life Altering Medicine,how often do little things things that would skip past your eyes a flash of light on the pond change one's outlook forever?so it is with bedhead and this album if you don't like trance music or don't like obscure bands this is definately the album that will bring you into this wonderful world of music driven by emotional swells and softspoken harmonious lyric flowing with the good kind of theological and personal content found in songs like living well or haywire that will make you happy to wake up every morning rolling from your bed pushing aside the curtain knowing that your bedhead will deeply touch the lives of thousands.
5,"The finest ""slowcore"" album I have come across.","To confirm what most of the reviews below have stated, this album is criminally overlooked. It is perfectly crafted indie rock without a weak moment. There are a lot of similar bands that get a lot more attention. For example, Low, Red House Painters, Mogwai, Pavement etc. The list goes on and on. I enjoy all the aforementioned bands, however, none of these bands comes close to the beautiful simplicity that is WhatFunLifeWas. Every tone on the album is perfect, every note played is perfect, Matt Kadane's understated voice blends perfectly with every instrument played, creating a sound that must be heard to be appreciated. Over the years I have heard many different albums, many very good ones, however, WhatFunLifeWas is up there with the best of the Beatles, Velvet Underground, Dylan, Young, Joy Division, The Clash, REM, Radiohead and any other ""classic"" artists. It is a shame so few have had the pleasure of hearing it."
5,"invaluable, indispensable book for children's writers and illustrators","i received this book on time, in good condition and have already read it twice. this is one of the best instructional manuals i've ever owned."
3,Nice hat for the money.,"I prefer flex-fit caps over adjustable Velcro strap caps. I own several flex-fit caps. The quality of the cap doesn't measure up to the other flex-fit caps I own. The elastic in the back is too large and stretchy. The elastic also flops down. In other words it's not sewn together as one in the back. The hat has no logo on the back like most sports caps. It has a bucket sort of fit in which the cap hits the crease of your ears if you put it on correctly. This cap certainly is NOT one of my favorites. I have worn it once to a game. It is not what I'd call an everyday cap. However, the value is unsurpassable. If you want a cap to wear to the Icehogs game you can't beat the price of this cap."
4,The Real Marblehead,"Although the author's photographs capture the very best of this quaint seaside village on Boston's North Shore, some of the sand and salt that covers this town is strangely missing. But no matter, I'm sending everyone in my family a copy for Christmas because these photos are better than the ones I've taken over the past three years."
5,Dorothy Dix - The Story Of A Compassionate Woman,"It was definitely worth the money, which was also a wonderful deal. I was very happy to find the book in the first place, with the added joy of such a good price."
3,Sorry Mitch -- this one comes up short,"Mitch Albom is my favorite author. I have been spoiled by Tuesdays with Morrie and Five People You Meet in Heaven. Like so many, I eagerly awaiting his next novel. The ghost of Chick ""the stories main character"" meeting his mother is a good one but somehow the story seems to drag out while not focusing in on why he needs he mother -- other than to get some motherly love. I was disappointed that Mitch didn't focus in on more of the struggles of Chick's life and how his mother could have directed the his misguidedness. The story did address these concerns during the last 10 pages but the middle of the book seems shallow in nature and went on forever. Reader beware and I have cautioned you about some possible disappointment. I hope the next Albom novel will life up to my expectations."
2,Heaven's Window,"I understand what Mitch Albom was trying to accomplish with this book, but I still think the ""one more day"" concept was done better in Lisa Mitchell Bridges' ""Heaven's Window."" I'd have to agree with what a previous reviewer said. Buy both books and then decide. Maybe I'm biased because I read ""Heaven's Window"" months before ""For One More Day"" came out, but I still think it does a better job reminding us of how much we should appreciate the people we love and how much peace we can find if we have a little faith."""
2,Disappointing.,"What a disappointment. No voice, predictable plot, nothing even remotely compelling. And I loved his other books. Bleh. I never lost the sense that Mitch Albom was writing story and manipulating my heart strings. Didn't work."
3,A Little Sappy,"I like his voice on the tape, but the story is a little too sappy for my taste. I didn't look forward to finishing it, and probably wouldn't have if I hadn't been on a long car trip with nothing else to listen to. If you like extremely sappy stories with very little action/plot, then you will like this. Not much happens and I was left feeling like he could have done so much more with such a fantastic idea."
4,Easy Read,Enjoyed this book - easy to read and keeps you wanting to know more about the characters. Worth your time.
4,a deeper look,Sometimes we need to stop and take a deeper look at where we are in life.We need to appreciate the people that are part of our lives.We should try to fix any issues that we have with people soon so that we don't live days of regret. The book touches you in a way of understanding what it means to take all your interactions in life at the fullest.
5,Absolutely a great read!,I read this book in a day. It was so wonderful I couldn't put it down. I cried when it was finished. It is heartwarming and eye opening. Not only should you read this book you should have your friends read it too.
4,Second chance . . .,"Although the author's theme woven into the fabric of several books has become somewhat predictable, I invariably pick up a new book he's written for a quick and inspirational read. I can't help it. I'm getting more sentimental as I get older.The main character is cloaked in abject despair over a life perceived to be not worth living. A string of failures ranging from business to interpersonal relationships have taken their toll. 'Chick' Benetto is on the skids. After a failed suicide attempt the ghost - all families have ghosts(?) - of his dead Mother appears. Together they spend a day that would be aptly characterized as mundane. However, forgiveness, redemption and appreciation of life's little - but not insignificant gifts - helps Chick to turn his life around one day at a time.Is there some gone from your life with whom you would like to spend one more day?"
5,"A touching, quick read","A great book. You will find yourself immersed in the story and have a hard time putting it down. A quick read, very heart-warming, an emotional book, tear-jerker. Highly recommended."
2,Don't buy this book!!,"Albom is a one-trick pony and, I admit, I was suckered into buying this book. But, it will be the last one of his that I purchase. In a word ""corny"". I want the time back I wasted reading this book. He's only in it for the money, at this point. He's a hack, a sell-out!"
1,For One More Day is a must read...,"Mitch Albom does it again. I thought the Five People You Meet in Heaven was a wonderful quick read, but For One More Day was a book I gave as a gift this Christmas!In some ways, this book has a message for everyone. I know we have all wished for ""one more day"" with a loved one or a friend we have lost. The tears that were brought by the book, also leaves you with a lesson and a feeling of hope.The reader may reflect on things that were ignored or not appreciated in their life until someone is lost. Estranged family members may begin to think of the value of not letting that situation be permanent. Families can read it and realize the true value of family. It was lovely, and for me, too short, because I did not want it to end.However, the fact that it is a short book, will also make it appealing to those who are not avid reader!High praise for this book."
5,ok.,The productis great. the only thing it took a while for me to recieve.I payed the two day delivery & it took two weeks But I still got charged for two days delivery. Not very happy with that. PS I still kept the product for me. originally Ordered for a gift but it took to long.
4,A Very Good Book with a Deep Message,"I think this book is very good, and beyond a doubt very well written. I think I loved the first two books more, for personal reasons. The idea of spending just one more day with my mother or many other people I have loved and lost to death certainly make me more aware of how I want to live the rest of my life.I think it was sad that anyone was so low that he thought of suicide. But then I have many physical problems that keep me on my toes and fighting for my own life . . .I still think it was a great way to show people that there are other in the world who might tbe begging for encouragement to live . . .looking for hope.Good job, Mitch. Thanks for another book."
1,dont remember getting this,"dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, sorry im not sure"
3,Just ok,I think the PR person for this author is great though. I was disappointed. It was ok but lacked something I could not put my finger on. Much better than 5 People in Heaven....
3,"Inspiring For Some, But Not As Good As His Previous Works","I've read both TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE and THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN, and was very moved by both of those books. This book has a good message, but does not leave the same impact as the other two, in my opinion. I think that's because the author hasn't truly experienced this loss as he apparently did in the other two. A forced sentiment comes across as a somewhat false sentiment.There is still a good message here, though it has more to do with divorce/regret than death/regret. And the book is a good testimony to the power of a mother's love. However, I don't think this is Mr. Albom's best work. It doesn't have the straight from the gut, his heart to yours that TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE or FIVE PEOPLE has."
3,Interesting story,I read it straight through because I couldn't put it down. It ended a bit abruptly as if there was a deadline and things were just wrapped up. I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it.
5,english class reading,I would buy Mitch Albums books just because they are great short easy read and it is just an added bonus that it is for my daughters english class. This is a great way to buy books and not go into sticker shock at the college book store.
3,"Great book, a little pricey though.","The book was pricey. I wish I had bought it at a book store. With regards to the book itself, it was a great book and really a good read. Next time, I will make sure I get a better deal."
3,Need 3 1/2 star rating!,"I love Mitch Albom! That being said, was this his best work? No. I liked the premise and fully understand wanting ""one more day"" with my mom or/and dad, but Mitch is so much better a writer than this book. I think he should stick to non-fiction. But I do you you, Mitch!"
3,Average read- nothing special,"I read this book for a book club meeting and must say that our group discussion turned out to be more interesting than the book itself. I read this book and couldn't help but see this grown man's attachment to his mother as a little abnormal. It seemed as if he contstantly pined for her as if he were still a little child. Although this story was told from his point of view, I actually related more with the mother - her pain, struggles and fears that he never saw while he was growing up. It was an okay read but may be a bit more interesting if you have people to discuss it after."
2,Disappointed :(,"I hate to do this to a Mitch Albom book, but...I was really disappointed in this one. I was all hyped about it, the premise looked fantastic. But it didn't deliver.I can't even place why I didn't care for it... I've just come away with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction on this one."
2,Not the best Albom book,I was a little disappointed and don't know that I'd recommend it. Other novels are more detailed and poignant. Underwhelmed.
3,I thought it would be btter,"I was really hoping it would be better, but it was just....okay. It was kind of cool the way Chick got to spend a day with his mother and really saw what she used to do at the end of her life, he had no idea. That bothered me because he really ignored her most of his life and thought his dead beat dad was amazing. I didn't like the way he disrespected his mother when he was a child and when he was an adult. Maybe that's why God took her away from him? It just teaches you to love your parents, grandparents, because one day they will be gone and you don't want to live with the regret that you didn't treat them as well as they deserved."
4,great purchase,i am in a book club and this book was chosen. i really enjoyed reading this book. there were several things i could relate to. it's a nice easy read that has a great moral. definitely suggest you read this.
3,For One More Day,"This was a nice and quick read. Not great, but interesting relationships and a reminder about what are the important things in life."
4,For One More Day,"I enjoyed this book as I have the author's previous books. Who wouldn't like to spend ""one more day"" with a loved one who has passed on? Mitch Albom is a great ""weaver of tales"" and when I finished the story it really got me thinking about just whom I'd like to spend ""one more day"" with(a possible book in itself???). I'm happy to recommend this book very much! It's not a masterpiece, but it's not supposed to be. Mitch Albom causes his readers to think and ponder. The book certainly deserves to be read and I guarantee it will stir up many memories as well as causing a degree of wistfulness."
2,Gravely Disappointing,"Albom centers all of his works on the same subject matter: the preciousness and value of our time, of our lives. Unfortunately, For One More Day is largely predictable and somewhat absurd. The twists are so ludicrious that they are almost laughable.In Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Albom poignantly prompts us, the reader, to reflect on the direction and purpose of our lives because we are faced with people and characters who we cheer for; they have faced tragedy and buckled to it, like many of us, or overcome it, like many of us hope to do. In For One More Day, the main character, Charley, is pathetic. His obstacles and situtations are so incredibly forced and silly, as is much of the dialogue, that I was left wondering if Albom had run out of material after his first two books and scratched something together for publishing.Sorry Mitch...I loved your first two books, but this is defintely not you best effort."
4,Amazing,Made me want to spend more time with my loved ones. I am not a big reader and my girlfriends told me to read it and I'm glad she told me to read it.
5,What Charley Found After He Staggered into His Old House,"I'd say Charley would have ended up in a complete loser without seeing his mother miraculously. She had already died a long time ago in reality, though. Because he got a chance to know more about his mother who he didn't recognize before her death. Of course, the family didn't always live happy lives. Charley's parents' divorce, his breakdowns of the minor baseball league, his losing jobs - he took such a real beating that he got addicted to alcohol.In the end, his wife, Catherine and her daughter walked away from him. To make matters worse, he wasn't invited to her daughter's wedding! After all, he regretted the rest of his life and attempted suicide, but in vain.Overall, he passed away 3 years after his attempted suicide. However, after he could see his mother, he was sure to be able to respect her and learn what he didn't know about her."
4,Life,"For One More Day, I liked the book, Actually I finished it in a weekend reading and although it did not reflect my life, could see where at 48 yrs old this would be close to the way many of our neighbors grew up and Mom ran the household and kept things together."
5,Each book just gets better...,"I thought it would be impossible for Mitch Albom to top ""The Five People you meet in Heaven"". Thankflly, I was wrong. This is the best book I've ever read...and I'm grateful for Mr. Albom for writing it. It touched my heart and my spirit completely."
4,A very touching story,It's rated a 4 because it took me a few minutes to understand exactly what was going onAfter I picked up on it I could not put it Down.
5,loved it,"if you loved any of his other books read it! if you have any faith of a higher power read it, even if you have little. Wonderful. Thoughtful"
1,Drowning in a vat of syrup,"I was asked to read this book and did so with an open mind. The idea of exploring the emotions of a flawed desperate man ready to take his own life should have led any reasonable author to explore the minefield of emotions which must consume such a 'lost' individual. What do we get with this book? a lesson in silliness and overbearing sentimentality. It is a truly awful unintelligent book. The author does not appear to have been close to anyone who has been on the brink of suicide for the main character is a flat, cardboard cut-out without substance and who elicits not sympathy from the reader. His relationship with his dead mother is superficial and fails to uncover anything interesting to justify the storyline. Why am I wasting more time on it with this review? Time to stop."
3,I expected much more from my first Mitch Albom book.,"While this book did offer interesting insight into the relationship between parents and children, that was about all it did.If it wasn't so short I would not have finished it. The book wasn't bad, but if I'd misplaced the book or gotten busy I would not have been disappointed.This book did NOT make me want to read more Mitch Albom books. I may pick one up at some point, since this book seemed more like a narration of someone else's story, but I'm in no hurry."
4,Mitch Albom scores again!,"Mitch Albom's latest is another tug on the ol' heart strings. A tragic yet touching read regarding one man's failed life, and how it was brought back on track when, after a failed suicide and a car accident, he gets one day with his long dead mother. The two do nothing spectacular, but in their reliving the routines of the past the man comes to realize what love and family really mean. While not as personally enjoyable as ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"" this is every bit as well written and just as deep. Plus, it's an easy read, right around 200 pages. Highly recommended."
1,Left disappointed,"I was very drawn by the premise of this story, but quickly tired after it began to go on and on with one boring cliché after another; it felt predictable and rather preachy. Only glad it was so short."
3,Borrow a friend's copy,"This book was not what I was enticipating it to be. I was expecting more soul searching and questions of ""What if..."" The novel is short and a worthy quick read; but I would borrow a friend's copy or wait until the book is available in paperback."
3,Good Enough,"If you've ever lost a loved one you know what it's like to long for just one more day, one more hour with that person to express your true feelings. We never get that chance but Mitch Album plays the fantasy out artfully in ""For One More Day."" I have to admit, it was really depressing and the characters were not ones you will warm up to. All in all it was a decent read but not what I would call a winner. Would have liked more depth, more character development, more heart really. It's a cautionary tale that most will ignore as it's only human nature to live life like there's no tomorrow. I guess you can sum this story up with the old adage ""hindsight is 20/20"" and if we could all look back from the present, we would certainly do things differently.The best thing about ""For One More Day"" is is it a very quick read. It doesn't hang around long enough or get you so involved you get angry. It's good enough."
3,liked it didn't love it,I really enjoyed Tuesday's with Morrie so i decided to read this book. While it was a good book it was nothing compared to Tuesday's with Morrie
4,Good Book,Great book enjoyed reading it. Hard too put down at times. A lot of flashbacks can get a little confused at times. Pretty easy read though overall.
5,loved this book,"a thought provoking read that will leave you happy and sad . it will stay in your mind for ever as you ask yourself the what ifs of life. another fantastic book by mitch albom. if you loved ""five people"" then you will love this one too."
2,Unlikely to obsurd,"Mitch Albom's writing style is too simplistic. You will feel like a child when reading this story, and I read through it. The book is well organized to the point of being predictable. Much too pat."
3,"Predictable, enjoyable tale of a mother's love","Mitch Albom, a well-known sports writer, takes a failed athlete through a contrived and totally predictable story of last minute rescue. Albom is an excellent story teller and builds likeable, human characters and comfortable, believable dialogue.The protagonist, Charles ""Chick"" Benetto, spent his life trying to please his distant and disappearing father only to discover that he had ignored the consistent and affirming love of his mother until it was too late. Or was it?A story that teaches the value of living and loving for today. An enjoyable read but it lacks the ""realness"" of Tuesdays with Morrie."
5,For One More day,"I loved this story. It is beautiful, & heartwarming. Everyone could relate to this story. It brought tears to my eyes. I couldn't lay it down."
5,I wish I had one more day,This book made me think about my mother. If you have lost someone close to you this book will make you think about things you wish you had known or asked your loved one before they died. If you haven't lost some one close to you then it will make you think of what to ask your loved ones now before it is too late.
3,Mother Son.........................special relationship,"Good book to read on a airplane, heavy message about taking advantage of everyday and every relationship. Life is very short."
1,"So promising, so disappointing!!","One more day with a lost loved one...oh the possibilities!!! If you have lost a loved one, you know the depth of feelings the author could have reached for. Unfortunately, the book was a disappointment! The characters were flat and antipathetic. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character and his regrets, and certainly, I did not feel like he redeemed himself towards his mother on that last chance he had with her...at any level! How can you read a book based on this storyline and not shed a tear, or achingly long for your lost loved one? Have Mitch Albom write the book."
3,Overall satisfied,"The book was nostalgic and a quick read. I really enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie and was disappointed by The Five People You Meet in Heaven. So, I was really hoping this book would prove to be better. I thought it was thought provoking and enjoyable overall. It was a bit heavy handed in its message, however."
3,Solid but not up to the level of the first few books,"I have really enjoyed the books Mitch Albom has written but found this book to have been not quite up to the level of the last books. It was a good read but given that I had lost my mom recently, I was expecting to really be affected by the book. He has knack for understanding the relationships between people and I enjoy his books."
3,Below his normal standard,"I'm a fan of Mitch Alborn and was excited by the prospect of reading another one of his books. I'm sorry to say that I don't think that this one is up to the standard of his previous works. Having said that, I read the book in (almost) one sitting and genuinely cried during one of the scenes. His direct, simple style is a pleasure to read, and the simple storyline is easy to follow, but I kept thinking ""where's the beef?""."
4,For One more Day,"I enjoyed this book - I think that Mitch Albom is a great writerI still think that ""Tuesday's With Morrie"" was his best book, but this is a close second.This book makes you think about where you have been and who has been in your life - makes you think that you should live each day to the fullest and enjoy what you have today."
2,Has never re-crezted depth of first book.,"Nicely done - however only GTuesdays With Morrie really was fabulous - this seemed like fluff.sorry, I love this writer."
1,What a crybaby!,This gets my vote as the most depressing book ever written. The hero(?) is nothing more than spineless crybaby. There are people who are also coping with losing a loved one without jumping off the deep end of the pool before checking if there's any water in it. I'm suprised it's been on every best seller list for so long.
1,Poor review,"This book was rated new and it arrived with a dirty book cover.It was so dirty with gunk stuck all over, I won't be using this seller again."
2,AUTHORS SHOULD NOT RECORD THEIR OWN BOOKS,"Note to authors: please hire a professional actor to read your books when recording them...you are not qualified to read them yourselves.I believe I could have really enjoyed this book if I had not heard it read by the author himself. The entire time I was listening to it, I kept trying to picture the words on the written page, and I kept imagining how the book would have sounded if someone different had been reading it aloud.Mr. Albom is not the first author to record his own books...but it would be really nice if he were the last."
2,Delusionary writing in form and content.,"Story of a mentally ill drunk who played for a short time with the Pitts' Pirates including a losing world series game who goes into a delusionary coma following a drunk driving crash going the wrong way up on the down ramp while on his way to see his dead mom who appears to him in his delusionary condition and comforts him because his daughter didn't invite him to her wedding but finally shows she really loves the old drunk because she got the book written. Lousy writing, undesirable characters, goofy circumstances...but thank goodness it was short being less than 200 pages."
1,Books for people who don't read books.,Pop garbage. Try reading some real literature instead of trash like this and The DaVinci Code. Mindless tripe that takes no insight whatsoever to assimilate. I wish I could give this zero stars (or a negative number).
5,Great Story,"This was a nice short story. If you've lost a loved one or have struggled with a past you've tried to overcome, you can relate to the main character."
4,one mor day with mom,There is a lot of sentiment contained in this book and the aor provides a fresh approach to a subject that afflicts us all--losing someone and wishing that you could have given them more of your compassion and thoughts and words before they passed away.
4,Thought Provoking,"The beginning of this book, while very well written and captivating had me rolling my eyes in a gesture of ""here we go again, another pity party"" - however by the end of the book, the only thing rolling were the tears down my face.This book will cause you to re-evaluate the way you have treated your mother, and/or loved ones, and remind you that it is important to show your appreciation for those you care about before it is too late."
2,Don't bother with this- just read his previous two,"I am generally a real softie for the ""cheese"" of Mitch Albom books. I find Tuesday's with Morrie a good blend of sentimentality and decent writing and storytelling. The Five People You Meet in Heaven leans more toward sentimentality, but I would still recommend it. For One More Day, however, is terrible. It is pure cheesiness and just kind of made me nauseaus, because the ""seize the day"" motif is so heavy handed. Work on your writing, Mitch, because this is just one big cliche!"
3,"Eh, ok","It was ok. I think that it fell short of meeting his prior work's level. It had a moral to it and was about something that makes the reader think, but it didn't touch me the way his first two works did."
4,Mitch does it again!!,"Mitch Albom does it again with ""For One More Day"". His other books include ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"" and ""Tuesdays With Mauri"" were a hard act to follow but Albom was able to do it again. This book will be able to reach out to anyone who has ever wanted that one last chance to say goodbye. Cheers to Mitch for another fantastic work of art."
4,everyone could always use one more day,"This is the 3rd book by Mitch Albom that I've read and it is just as touching as the others. This is the story of a man whose life has gotten so hard that he decides to kill himself. He is on his way to his childhood home, when he walks in and his mother is there. His mother who died eight years earlier. He gets to spend one more day with her and realizes things he never would have without that day.Reading this book will really make you look at things differently - in a good way :)"
3,It Didn't Cut,"I am a fan of Mitch Albom's works. I loved Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven. His previous books were simply, but powerfully, touching. I was always profoundly moved when I read his books. However, this book just didn't make justice with Albom's writing style. The moral message was dry and stuffy, its prose was jerky, and it felt WAY too corny. At least his other books were not filled with the corniest sentimental lines like in For One More Day. Overall, it was not a good book. Read Tuesdays with Morrie or Five People You Meet in Heaven if you want to taste Albom's real style."
1,If I Had One More Day...,"I would hunt this Alborn fella down like the snake-oil salesman he is. He abuses weak people's desires to feel better by feeding them treacly motivational glop that appeals to their TV denuded emotions. Meanwhile, he reaps money by the ton. You can bet he feels good. You can also find better writing in e-mails you get asking you to forward it to all your other fool acquaintances so some fictitious dying kid will get a sponge bath from the cast of Desperate Housewives.Alborn makes book burnings seem like a good idea whose time has come."
5,good book,"My friend asked me to purchase the book for her, she has never used amazon. She was surprised how quickley the book arrived!"
3,Didn't live up to expectations,"This book was alright with a nice storyline, however, it was not nearly as moving as either Tuesdays with Morrie, or The Five People You Meet in Heaven."
3,A Typical Mitch Albom Book,"I read For One More day in a day. This book was very sweet, and written in the same easy to read style as his previous books. This Story is about a man named Chick, who is having some personal problems and hits rock bottom in the meantime he becomes aquainted with his deceased mother for one more day. This gives Chick a new perspective of his mother that he had not seen before. As with all Mitch Albom books, he gets you started thinking. If you like this book I reccomend you read The Five People You Meet in Heaven."
2,Better reading available than FOR ONE MORE DAY.,"So, So. I didn't enjoy this one as much as others. Starts out a little dark - you're a little confused throughout - and then has a nice touch at the end but overall too sad. Positive message is why outshadowed by darkness. Almost didn't get through it."
4,For One More Day,Thoughtfully written especially for those who are struggling with the loss of a loved one. I continue to wish for one more day eight years after my father's death. A comforting read.
5,to mom - for one more day,I enjoy reading any of Mitch Albom's books. They are filled with insight and he touches on things we think about but never discuss.
4,a book to reflect on long after the read,"As much as I appreciate Kindles, Mitch's books are best read in hardcovers, absorbed through each recycled leaf, and reflected in silent nights. For One More Day, a story about a mother's love, so pure and so unshakable, that it echoes beyond the physical that we reside in. A story that is profound in its utmost simplicity, and that is why I love Mitch Albom's books."
5,awesome!,J have never left a revuew. I'm not even done with the book but this story is a huge keeper. Amazing story and the way its told is perfection
4,Highlander Gambit,"Major Loren Jaffay of the elite troops of the Death Commandoes of the Capellan Confederation is sent on a mission to destroy the ""evil"" Highlander Regiment because they deserted the Confederation in thier time of need. I think this is a pretty exciting book to read because in the middle of Jaffay's mission the Highlanders split up and battled the Eighth's RTC units. Buy this book it is a good read!!"
1,Don't judge a movie by the names on the box...,"This was in the cheap bin at Wal-Mart, so I thought I'd give it a chance, seeing as how it 'featured' Dan Akroyd and John Belushi directed by Steven Spielberg. Towards the end of the movie, I found myself crying out for the pain to end. Most of the humor lies in the ridiculous slapstick category, which would make it a great children's movie if not for the constant sexual references (honestly, the funniest joke was the innuendo about the B-17). My only hope is that you see this review while trying to decide if you should purchase the DVD, and it makes you decide not to buy it. Epic Failure in the truest sense of the term."
3,wild and crazy comedy about start of WWII in Californioa,"The zoot suit riots didn't actually take place until 1942,but there actually was a little hysteria about fear the Japanese would attack California next with no US Navy to protect them.The B 17 bomber in the movie is also a little early probably.The comedy about the army, the General, shooting at friendly planes,is almost as funny as the Japanese in a German U-boat off Los Angeles.In 1942 they rounded up California Japanese and sent them to camps,so the fear was real.John Belushi as the fighter pilot is kind of a classic now.I liked the movie, but it kind of distorts history."
3,A little slow in delivery,"This item was mailed to a friend direct..according to speed of another item I had ordered the same day, this item did not reach the same destination until 7 days later than the first and they were both ordered same day and 5 minutes apart."
4,GREAT MOVIE FOR SLIM PICKENS FANS!!!,"I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED SLIM PICKENS IN MOVIES, AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION.THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY UNCLE, AND I KNOW HE'LL ENJOY IT A LOT."
1,Tore it! Tore it! Tore it!,"A boring comedy with no sense of timing, made even worse in its ""extended version"". It's like a long joke badly told; you cringe all the way through it. Rule of thumb: avoid any movie referred to as ""wild"", ""zany"", ""wacky"", ""crazy"", ""insane"", ""hysterical"" or ""screwball"", unless you have a taste for forced humor, overkilled comedians, worn slapstick, or excruciating experiences in general. If so, man, is this the movie for you: a dummy gets the best laugh!"
1,"Good movie, disc not enhanced for widescreen","1941 itself is an entertaining movie, and I have always enjoyed it thoroughly. I was quite shocked to buy the disc and find that first and foremost it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so you have to zoom to view it in the proper aspect ratio, thus distorting the resolution. Secondly, the colors on this print are very blurred. It was originally slapped onto DVD at the end of the '90s, well before the concept of cleaning prints and removing dust and fecks was common practice. In short, it still has not received this treatment and desperately needs it. Good movie, bad disc, a pity."
5,Very Funny,Loved it. Belushi was as funny as I expected. Glad a friend recommended that I watch it. It was worth it.
5,1941,"I had forgotten how funny this movie was. Great to watch, the actors are doing their best at being funny."
3,Video Not Good!,"This is a fun movie with memorable bit actors like Slim Pickins and a great scene on board the Japanese sub that is quite funny. Lots of take-offs from current events and other movies past and present at the time. Lots of memoreable chareacters. But the biggest problem I have with this version of the movie is the transfer. This is without a doubt one of the worst video transfers I have ever seen. The DVD looks and feels like it was done in someone's garage instead of in a valid studio. If you like this movie as I do then please just get the VHS tape, trust me, the DVD is much worst than the VHS tape which I have both. Good fun movie, lousey transfer method, I would swear that a bootlegger did the transfer."
3,"The Japanese are Coming, the Japanese are Coming!","This movie was under appreciated by critics. Ever see them praise a comedy, especially a spoof? Any fan of movies like ""Airplane"", ""Animal House"", or ""The Russians are coming, The Russians are Coming!"" should like this movie. After this, movies in the same comic vane like ""Naked Gun"" would receive more credit. A few more jokes, and a little less length and it probably would have been a bigger hit. The first time I saw this when it was released I thought it was a bit long and it wasn't quite what I expected. With more viewings it gets better. Look for numerous cameos. At the current price for the collector DVD it is a bargain. Any fan of Saturday Night Live or Second City TV should grab it up."
3,1941 hahahahahaha,I like 1941. John Belushi I great as Wild Bill Keisto. Robert Stack is good as the colonel. Speilberg made his first flop. Dan Aykroyd and John Candy are outstanding.A Steven Speilberg Film John Belushi Dan Aykroyd John Candy Treat Williams Robert Stack and Christopher Lee.
4,"Spielberg's biggest Flop,and my favorite film from him","I just love this movie,I don't know what it is,but I can watch it anytime,and still see something new.There's just so much going on,your never bored.John Belushi really steals every scene he's in. The physical comedy of John's is missed alot. Dan Aykroyd is always fantastic.With his fast talking,and all of a sudden some word comes out that blows you away. I also enjoy Treat Williams and his hatred of Eggs. I also can't stand the taste,touch,or smell of an Eggs. I die laughing when the fairest wheel comes off,and rolls off the pier with the dummy screaming. This movie will live on forever,even though it was Spielbergs biggest flop."
2,Wait for the Blockbusters...,"Interesting movie from Spielberg, gets funnier after repeated viewings. The digital transfer leaves a lot to be desired, however. There are plenty of compression artifacts, and the overall look of the DVD is ""soft"". I'll be first in line when the Raiders series is released, but this is a Spielberg movie you can do without."
3,No SUBTITLES! and edited.,"Mostly okay, but without the subtitles, you loose all the interplay between Christopher Lee and Toshiro Mifune (such brilliant casting). Also, weirdly edited. All the black/white racial comedic/commentary interaction is edited out, but Belushi is still allowed to say ""eat lead slant"" Some whole scenes are missing (Slim Pickens capture). Sometimes it's 10 or 20 seconds of transition or explanation that someone randomly thought was unnecessary (it is). Hard to believe this film was ever released in this format anywhere. It watches more like a local TV station edit for time and commercials. Transfer is not what I would consider HD quality."
4,movie,This movie was so funny but had a friend watch it with me that has seen it before and one part of the movie was not in it so that is why i gave it a 4 star.
5,christmas tradition,"This movie is a christmas classic! A must-see during the holidays. The jaws scene at the beginning of the movie was great, and we love the story line. It's going in the annual rotation and will add to our enjoyment of the season."
3,Watching it again is disappointing...,"I haven't even seen this DC, but I know the old film used to be funny when I was eleven to thirteen. I cannot see why I enjoyed this film then. Spielberg has done better, thank God, but this ""comedy"" wasn't as good the second time. Rated PG for nonstop action violence, quite harsh language, and nudity."
1,The Frisco Kid still awaits DVD release and this piece of crap has a SPECIAL EDITION DVD!!!!,"1941 was, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I think I might have been mildly amused in the part where there are two guys trapped up in a Ferris Wheel and one guy annoys the other with his dummy, but I might have been dreaming because I FELL ASLEEP!!!THE FRISCO KID WAS A HELLLLL OF A LOT FUNNIER THAN THIS PIECE OF $HI+!!!!!!RELEASE THE FRISCO KID ON DVD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Simply Awful,"What a waste of talent. I don't even want to give this movie onestar. Surprised this bomb is still in print, it's truly a dawg. I picked it up in the library, I saw John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, figured it would be good. Wrong.It is bad as it can get. Spielberg tried to use slapstick. It's continiously not funny.To think of all the stunts and wrecks and all the money that wasted making this film, and there are people starving. I just could not wait until it would end, and it seemed like it would never end. Animal House, the blues brothers and even neighbors it is not. Don't waste your evening."
3,"Good comedy, but too long","The premise for this movie is simple enough: a Japanese submarine, two weeks after the attack at Pearl Harbor, seeks to destroy the will of the American populace by destroying Hollywood. However, they get a little lost.The Americans, in the meantime, are dealing with anti-Japanese hysteria, insane fighter pilots, well-meaning (but destructive) tankers, and riots between Army soldiers and Navy sailors.The movie is quite funny, but it's just too long. Comedies shouldn't last for more than an hour and half, two hours at the most, but 1941 drags on for nearly 3 hours. By that time, all the jokes have been told, and it seems that the characters have resorted to filler."
3,Long sentences punctuated with laughter...,"I would need to compare this new Director's cut DVD with the originally released version, but it seems as if the fat has been reapplied to a lean steak. I found my attention wandering often, and imagined I saw the seams where unnecessary elements were reinstated, to the viewer's detriment.Having said that, the film is still enjoyable, and the humor often works well when it appears. Large scale production and well-filmed miniatures combine for a spectacular visual feast. A fun film to watch with a group, so you can chat up the slow parts and magnify your laughter when the slapstick hits the fan."
3,The Forgotten Spielberg Classic,"This movie is BIG. It had big stars, a big budget, big expectations and it was a big flop in the box office.This movie was hot on the tails of Spielberg's first classics Jaws & Close Encounters, so everybody was expecting a mega-blockbuster as a follow up. His next film was the hugely popular E.T., so this one just faded away.For what it's worth, I wasn't entirely impressed with it when it came out, but I'm a huge Aykroyd and Belushi fan, so I enjoyed it a bit more than the average person. As years passed, I realized (along with a lot of other people), that this was not really a bad movie.In retrospect, it's got quite a few good moments and it's worth seeing again with an open mind. The extra footage added to the DVD helps fill in some of the continuity gaps that were not in the original, so it may be worth seeing just to see more of the original cut."
4,Sillyness knows no bounds,"This over looked master piece was ignored by the American people, and dismissed by critics. Take another look. It's long, but the feel of the film reminds me of It's a mad, mad ,mad, mad world. Relax, don't be in a hurry and enjoy this comic masterpiece by Spielberg and a cast of thousands. Also worth your time is the making of 1941 included on this DVD."
4,"""Dad, you're ruining Christmas!""","This may have been a flawed film, but it really wasn't all that bad! Some scenes are, in fact, hilarious! But other parts are over-acted and overly-silly. This movie is semi-based on a real incident that happened on the west coast shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when war-jitters were at an all-time high! A Japanese submarine really did surface off the California coast and shell a refinery, doing minimal damage (it was operational again within a day!) This movie-version of that event expands upon it, sometimes with hilarious results --- and sometimes not. Still, the production values are excellent, and it moves at a quick pace. And if you like swing-music from the World War II years you'll want to see it for that alone!"
1,What a disappointment!,"This is a bad re-mix of a great movie. First, they got the screen aspect wrong. Second, the restored footage is of very poor quality. It's easy to see what new scenes have been added... just look for the blurry parts!I loved this movie at the theatre and on VHS. Too bad that when I wanted to purchase it on DVD there's now only this garbage version available.Not worth a nickel in my opinion."
1,Don't buy this one--get the U.K. DVD!!,"I bought this one, and I just got the British DVD from amazon.co.uk. This one is letterbox non-anamorphic, meaning the picture uses about 1/2 of your screen. The British one is anamorphic, meaning it fills the screen. If you don't have a PAL dvd player ($50-$100 last I looked), I'm sorry, but you're not a serious movie lover anyway. Just go ahead and get the player -- life is short. (If you don't see this as a comic masterpiece that's another strike against you. We're talking serious business here -- great comedy.)"
3,A complete idiocy!,"Well, I was aware of the movie's genre when I was buying it. But I didn't expect it to be that stupid! Steven Spielberg must be a real genius to put so much idiocy in one movie! Everything is just incredibly exaggerated. Imagine Los Angeles getting laid waste by its citizens just because of fear to be attacked by the Japanese! No, I don't understand that kind of humor. I barely made it to the end. If you decide to watch it, have a good load of beer first."
5,"Skip the extended version, the shorter one is better","First of all, I think you should watch the original, shorter version of this movie. The extended version has some scenes that slow down the pace and aren't really necessary.I really like the sheer zaniness and energy it has. It only seems to slow down a few times here and there to introduce a new character or story element and then it's back to the fun! If you like fast-paced slapstick or silly comedies then you'll probably enjoy this one.I'd probably compare it with Time Bandits or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. They don't take themselves too seriously and always make me smile when I think about them."
2,"Unfunny movie, bad DVD","Others have written about how unintentionally unfunny this picture is. And I agree. Even with character actors like Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Slim Pickens, and Ned Beatty, everything falls flat. But what really depressed me about the Collectors Edition DVD was the poor quality of both video and audio. The DVD is NON-anamorphic, which would have kept me from purchasing it had I known. On top of that, there's this fuzzy, vaseline-on-the-lens effect to much of it, which I assume was the intent of the filmmakers and not a flaw of the DVD. But it's really pretty distracting now. And even though the DVD has a 5.1 audio track, the audio is distorted and clipped.If you really want to own this movie, wait for (or look for) an anamorphic transfer that has an improved soundtrack."
5,Much overlooked.,"I love this film!!! This is Spielberg's wildest, most frantic film. The jokes are hilarious, the action is aplenty and the sets are huge. A great film that never received the attention it so deserved."
1,A Bloated Mess. HORRID,with it being 2hrs and 26mins long this movie is a bloated mess from master Steven Spielberg who hasn't had a bad movie since never all his movies have been good. this is horrid i didn't find any form of humor in this mess of a movie. Jim Belushi is so unfunny and everything is bad what was Steven Spielberg thinking when he decided to makes this Horrid Movie
1,A horrible bloated self indulgent so called comedy.,"This film is horrid. HORRID!!! Having recently viewed it, I found it extremely difficult to find jokes or anything structured like a joke anywhere in this so called comedy. It's idea of a big laugh is an explosion which it constantly reminds us of in the closing credits. The pacing is so incredibly slow there's no opportunity for comedic timing. BAD through and through. (I'm shaking my head now) Bad."
2,Only its mother could love it.,"I began collecting DVDs recently and the only disc I regret buying thus far is 1941. You see, I was tempted by the exhaustive extras and the chance to see Spielberg's director's cut. Don't fall into the same trap, dear readers. This film is bad. I got as far as 25 minutes in and decided I couldn't take anymore. It's a film which believes that there is a goldmine of comedy to found in shouting, falling over, and then shouting again. Not funny. If sitting in front of an animated corpse was bad enough, it turns out the extras are a chore, too - the dullest being a very long, very boring documentary about the making of the film in which all involved (who should have known better) recount in nauseating detail how the film came to be. A waste of time and money - theirs and yours"
1,great movie-bad dvd,"one of spielberg's craziest movie...great fun if you are on the right wavelenght..awful non anamorphic dvd,with some of the worst colours ever seen on my screen..just worth for the extra documentary..good old vhs much better..what a shame.."
1,A Complete Waste of Talent,"First let me say that I love comedy. If this film had any comedy in it, I'd love it too. Unfortunately, this is just a frenetic and pointless attempt at humor that explodes into two plus hours of tedium. There is abundant talent here, but it is rarely used. The sparsity of plot, which usually works in comedy's favor, here, just highlights how sad the jokes are. There is scarcely a laugh in the entire movie.How anyone can take a fantastic cast like this, and create a bomb like this is beyond me. To borrow a line form Pauline Kael, ""If this movie were any more of a dog, it would shed!"""
1,"Sucks, sucks, sucks!","After hearing about how horrible this film was for years, I decided to check it out, thinking it can't be that bad. Trust me, it is that bad.""1941"" is nothing but 2.5 hours of smug, overpaid celebrities screaming and yelling, and trying way too hard to be outrageous. Spielberg's limp, PG-rated attempt at 1970s ""slash-and-burn"" humor is the obvious precursor of such unfunny ""wacky"" dreck as ""The Cannonball Run."" Lame, lame, lame."
2,Too long for a bad movie.,"My first impression about this movie: too much overrated and hysterical. Check other parodies, like Dr. Strangelove which is shoter and much better than this."
2,Pretty watchable for a bad movie,"""1941"" is a complete mess with a whole lot of unfunny forced jokes and an awful screenplay (by Robert Zemeckis and John Milus). It's clear that Spielberg is a talented filmmaker who doesn't quite have the knack for choosing good scripts. While nearly everything he did before this was gold (including ""Duel"" and ""The Sugarland Express"")... he was obviously at a loss for how to handle a slapstick comedy. That said, his talent does shine through in a lot of scenes. There's a pretty fun dance number, the special effects for the plane chase through Hollywood haven't dated a bit, and how can anyone resist a movie that pairs up Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee? Maybe the casting of Mifune wasn't such a good choice, because I couldn't root against him, even while he was plotting to blow up Hollywood. I just couldn't!"
4,1941,"I actually bought this movie as a birthday present for my adult son. He said he enjoyed the movie years ago, plus the fact that some of the delete scenes cut from the original movie were restored. I have yet to watch the movie myself(I saw it years ago),but I will watch it when I have time in the future. Thank you!"
5,1941-Review,Very pleased with the condition of the dvd and the timeframe that the dvd was received.Thanks
4,Not nearly as bad as HOOK!,"This was Spielberg's one time shot at comedy, and you have to give him credit for trying.1941 is not the funniest film ever made, but it's loud, wild and zany, which makes it a lot of fun to watch. The opening parody on his own JAWS with Christine Blakely is especially original.What made this film work at the time (1979), I think, was its cast of stars, who were all fresh off of some very popular work at the time, including films like ANIMAL HOUSE, JAWS 2, SUPERMAN, and TV shows like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, EIGHT IS ENOUGH and BOSOM BUDDIES.I loved this movie, even though it bombed. If nothing else, Spielberg decided to learn from his mistake and not try comedy again."
3,WW II Spoof,"Complete with lots of stars, zanyness, and mayhem. Reaches slapstick comedy levels at times and is confusing. Three cheers for a bungling military saving our coast."
4,One of the Phunniest movies ever,I can't believe some of the harsh reviews of this movie - it's always been one of my favorites. Any movie that has 2 guys sitting with a wooden dummy in a giant Ferris wheel shooting at planes with a rifle has got to be a hit.
5,For Her,"I really enjoy the mix between soul and jazz on this album, required listening for anybody who has a musical ear."
4,Big fan,This album is a pleasure to listen to. I have almost all of Walter Beasley music and this one is some of his best work.
5,Plasma Car -- Pleasantly Perfect!,"This was a gift for our young daughter on Christmas. She LOVES it!!! She has played with it EVERY day since Christmas. While she can get it to motate by just using the steering wheel on hard, smooth surfaces, she prefers to use her leg power and just zoom around on it. We have not taken it outside and I do agree with other reviewers who say this will adversely affect the wheels and how it moves. The car itself is not overly bulky and can turn on a dime. My husband and I have been most pleased with this purchase! My husband put it together and did not have any trouble at all. I would say it is my daughter's favorite toy from Christmas, hands and wheels down! For kids who have outgrown their ""toddler cars"" but still want to zoom around, I highly recommend it."
5,My Son LOVES IT!,"My son received this when he was 2 years old, he is rather big for his age so size wise it fit him fine. It also fit our 14 year old. The 14 year old kept showing our toddler how to work it, and by the time he was 2 1/2 he knows how to swivel it and make it go without pushing off with his feet. It is an awesome toy, though a tad noisy on our hard tile floors. :) It is awesome!! :)"
5,Packaging Issue,"The plasma car arrived promptly, but was not opened until Christmas. It was then we discovered broken wheels on the car. It had been shipped along with another item, the car loosely wrapped in a thin, plastic bag. Not even a layer of bubble wrap. It's difficult to explain to a preschooler that his new toy cannot be fixed!"
1,does not move fast as it claims,"After reading so many 5 star readings I thought it would be fun for the kids to use this. But as the product claims, it doesn't move as fast as supposed to. I was so disappointed after I saw its performance, waste of money. The only way it is used is , one of my kid sits in it and other one pushes it, and they take turns to ride on it. Could have bought a different toy."
4,inclination was a bust,We have an exceptionally large driveway which I've always considered essentially flat. Coasters worked great going down the driveway but to get back up which is less than a 5 degree incline was a bust.
3,Fun for all but poorly made,"I bought this for my 3 year old. He couldn't figure it out on his own but after a little coaching loved it! Unfortunatley the cheap plastic parts began breaking within a few months of use. :( it was rated to withstand over 100lbs but when my little sister got on (she's 13 and weighs 80ish lbs) it didn't work nearly as well, there was a lot of drag on the wheels that turn to propel the car."
4,2 YRS IS MAYBE 2 YOUNG,"This is a durable toy that I am sure my grandson will love as the years go by. Right now, he can't grasp the idea that it is not his feet that will propel the car. I have shown him lots of short videos but since there is no older child that can demonstrate and no adult small enough to show him, he still has not used his arms and hand movements on the wheel to move this car. I still think it will last him and become more fun for him as he gets older and understands the concept. I don't see how this is an educational toy. I will be glad when he finds out how much fun it can be.PlasmaCar Blue"
5,Plasma car,My kids absolutely love this ride on. It turns on a dime and is very entertaining and fun. It is by far a family favorite.
5,Great little scooter car,"No issues. I have both a swivel car and plasma car and the plasma car's quality is higher (better, more durable wheels, stronger connecting points, and overall a more solid chassis). My 2 year old is having a great time with it. He can push it with his legs to go very fast or use the steering motion to propel himself at a slower rate.Cons: Wish they had more colors."
2,Not worth the money,"Not worth the money. I took into consideration the 5 star reviews and the videos of kids having good time on the plasma car. Unfortunately the car did not move anywhere close to what the videos showed. We tried tile, carpet and wood and the result was the same. The wheels just slid back and forth and the car did not move forward. If the wheels were made of a different material it would have probably worked as expected. Also consider that the back and forth motion caused scratches on the wood surface. My suggestion....get a trike it would be better and more fun for kids."
5,AWESOME !!!!!!,"I bought this car for 2 of my 3 grand-kids and they have an absolute blast on them. The 2 year old was fighting over them so I had to buy a third one for him. It is the best riding toy ever, and the adults love them too !!!!"
5,SO WORTH THE MONEY,"I bought 2 of these last year for christmas. my children are 11,8,3,1. They have ridden them EVERYDAY since either in the house or speeding down the driveway racing each other. My dh even rides it sometimes and he weight 200# :) these cars are amazing. so easy to ride either nice and slow or if you use foot power they really speed along. i am buying a third one this year :)"
1,Not what we expected,I bought this for my 3 year old and am very dissapointed. It does not ride as advertised. He ends up pushing himself with his feet instead. The plastic wheels wear out quickly!!!
1,Pure Chinese Junk,"I returned this today to Amazon. The manual indicates that Plasmacar is not recommended for use on hardwood and laminated floors (it leaves scratch marks) and it is dog slow on carpet, concrete and asphalt surfaces. It begs the question what surface it is designed for then? Mars, perhaps.Typical low quality Chinese manufacturing. Once assembled, wheels cannot be removed so I had to curse its Canadian maker/designer even when packing it for return as it could not fit in the box it came in.Do your child a favour and buy her a book instead. For a child, nothing is worse than a disappointing toy and Chinese-made toys are reliably so."
1,"poor design, almost non funtional","I'm a professional product designer with over 18 yrs experience. Though this was a gift, this is one of the the WORST TOYS I have seen in years. To the point of a scam! Perhaps it would work better indoors and destroy your floors. It did not work outside. The way it is designed to generate forward motion like a skateboarder uses side to side motion, the wheels are hard plastic and would generate very little forward motion. A push car would be better. In a period of two days the wheels were ground down. This product is so bad I'm looking for what plastics were used so that I can break it down for recycling as the raw materials are worth more than the product it's self. Not sure who were the judges who gave this an award from the Openheim Platinum Toy Award. They should consider finding a new vocation."
5,"After 2 years, this still gets played with EVERY day","We love love love our plasma cars! I paid a lot more than they sell for now, but I certainly don't regret it. Very few toys stick around our house for too long because the kids outgrow them, get bored with them, or they fall apart. But I anticipate having our plasma cars for many more years before any of those things happen. So far, we've had them for almost 2 years. My children are now almost 4 and 8 years old and use their cars daily. We have laminate wood floor that are very smooth and they cars work perfectly on those floors. In our kitchen where the floor is vinyl, the car is a bit sluggish. We took the car to the park once and it did okay on the sidewalks, but it wasn't good enough to bother ever taking it again. If you have very smooth floors, this is an awesome toy. Otherwise, you should just pass on this one because it just doesn't work well on anything but really smooth surfaces."
5,Two years later ... perfect indoor toy for winter.,"I bought this for my 2 year old and my 8 year old loves to ride on it too. It has a high weight limit and teaches about balance, and opens the door for learning about elementary physics concepts as well. It's seemingly indestructible, and yes I've even given it a whirl at 185 lbs and had a blast. For long winters during the wind chill advisory times, it's the perfect toy to get the kids going. If you have a long hallway, definitely it will be much more fun for the kids. We've never taken it outside before on the pavement though the FAQ says that you can."
5,If I could give more than 5 stars I would!,"This car is SO much fun! I bought this for my 14 month old after debating between a radio flyer scootabout, little tikes ride on, and other ride on toys. I was tired of buying things that she grew out of in a few months. She loves this car and has fun on it and my husband and I have a blast on it too. She and I ride all over the house together and have so much fun! I know we'll use this for years to come. It is a little unstable for a 14 month old but I'm always with her when she uses it."
4,Causes fighting among children (in a good way),Now I wish that I'd bought two of these. Both of my children ages 5 and 3 love this little car. It can get going pretty fast and I think they like that there is no pedaling required to go. It's well built.
5,Love it!!!,My son is two and nephew three. The both of them love it. It was very easy for them to learn how to get the car moving.
5,Durable!,"I'll be honest, I personally enjoy using this thing. It's stable and fast enough to get some serious speed down hills and I've been able to get about 5 ft of air off of homemade kickers. The front wheel did come off a few times but it snaps right back into place. This thing is virtually indestructible for all practical purposes."
4,Perfect toddler car,This is a perfect toddler car once they figure out how to make it move. The only thing I didn't like was finding out might not do good on wood floor after opening box.It does however work ok on their wood floors.
4,A 3 year old loves his Plasma Car.,"Our 3 year old friend is wild about his new Plama Car. He ""zooms"" around the house on it and also uses it outside. We think it was the best toy he got for his birthday."
3,"Great design, poor materials","This is a wonderful toy for 3-5 year olds. Our 9 yrs old niece (70 lbs) visited and tried to use it on pretty smooth asphalt and it really wore down the wheels. Now when the smaller kids use it, they say it doesn't work as well anymore. The product desc says max weight is 220 lbs but don't expect it to work well beyond 50 lbs (unless you have hardwood floors or linoleum.) We use it on asphalt or cement sidewalks and it works ok for the little ones. It's disappointing, considering the design is innovative and yet the materials couldn't hold up."
4,Cute,"My boys, 2 and 7, loved driving around on the plasmacar in the house. Definitely need a smooth flat surface. Can be hard to get going fast. My 2 year old just pushed with his feet. Even the adults tried them out.....everyone was intriqued. For something different, I would recommend the plasmacar."
3,"Great, fun car but steering handle doesn't stay screwed!","What a pain to have this awesome car but only to be able to use it for a few rides before the steering handle comes unscrewed rendering the car useless. This is a design flaw that needs to be addressed. No matter the size of child riding the PlasmaCar, it continues to come unscrewed, therefore, leaving the car undriveable since it's the steering mechanism that actually makes it go."
5,Great for a child any age,"My son got this for Christmas 2 years ago. He is now 9 yrs.old and still rides around on our hardwood floors all through the house. I am going to get one for my 4 yr. old daughter now, she loves his. It is very durable and easy to put together as long as you get the nut on the steering wheel just right before tightening. If the steering wheel is off, the car doesn't work as well."
2,Disappointment!,"We tried one before and that is the reason for the purchase, but the one I purchased does not seem to work as well on many surfaces and even on smooth surfaces.....so disappointed for my grandson!"
3,"Fun, but extremely difficult to assemble","My daughter loved playing with this car at a friend's house, so I decided to get one for her for this Christmas (at $40 for the blue/red, it was a great price). My only caveat is that the car was extremely difficult to assemble, even though there are only 3 or 4 steps. I might also question the durability, as it is mostly made from plastic--even the wheels! I talked to other people who had purchased the plasmacar from other retailers, and theirs were shipped already assembled. The extra cost buying somewhere else would be worth it in my opinion, since it took me well over an hour to get the car together correctly. Now to see if it works!!Oh, and the plastic pieces were scuffed when I removed it from the box, so it doesn't have that ""brand new"" look, which was also disappointing."
4,Could be really fun but....,"I think this is a clever toy that could be a lot fun, however I think I was being a little too optimistic about how much room we would need to use it. My advice....if you don't have a really big smooth surfaced area to ride it on (like a big garage), you probably shouldn't get it."
3,Celtic Claddagh Bracelet,"This a a nice value for the money. The claddagh's and links are on the small side, not so much to my taste. However, I bought it as a gift for a very small woman. Communication and shipping are just as promised. The vendor is one you can do business with without hesitation."
5,Great rack,We used this in our green egg to do turkeys. It held large turkeys without problems and cleaned up very easily
4,Michaels Review,The Monster Sirius Dish Mount was well made and easy to install. Also the adjustability of the design makes mounting in various postions or locations possible.
4,Sirius Reception,This is an easy product to install and the reception is exceptional. You can position the antenna easily and installing on the DirecTV mast made this a no-brain er.
1,NOT THE REAL THING,"If you want the genuine burgess bits Make sure they say the burgess edge on them cuz if you don't you might save a few bucks but you'll be disappointed like I was and end up getting the originals from Micheal Burgess himself. If you order them off amazon make sure they say the burgess edge, or you'll get his rejects. The real thing works great."
5,Great resource,My 1st graders and preschoolers loved hearing Shakespeare presented in a way they could understand. I love that the author includes quotes from the play along with simple to understand language. The illustrations are great and bring the story's to life.
5,Shakespeare Made easy,"""Tales from Shakespeare"" By Marcia Williams is the best way to explain Shakespeare. I have used this book to help Middle and High Schoolers understand what was happening in the plays...Now they are interested to do more reading. Marcia has a great way of touching the point and having fun with it.If you want to understand Romeo and Juliet, The Winter's Tale, MacBeth, Hamlet, The tempest and Julius Ceasar, this book is great. She has other books to check out too."
1,Shut Eye,I bought this only because Stana Katic was in it. I watched about 20 minutes of it and then I threw it out. No stars. I would have wanted to know that it was not disgusting.Elaine Creaden
2,Only for Stana Katic fans,Worth watching if you want to see a young Stana but not a movie I'd sit down to watch otherwise.
5,are you kidding?,"Every once in a while something comes along that exposes everything else as it really is -fake. With ""punk rock,"" Crust is the scariest of them all and puts all the fakes to shame where they belong... If you're sick of cute, be warned, every band will seem cute after listening to this album -necessary listening!No band beats this band. And their other two cd's are good too (too bad their 'FoodEater' cd is not available -its got some good songs too -tracks 2, 3, and 6- just in case)"
3,Unforgivably Bad Directions!,"We recently spent a week visiting Lafayette and the surrounding area in search of music and dancing, both Cajun and Zydeco. This book is the most helpful resource we could find anywhere. But we were disappointed to discover the hard way that some of the directions are impossible to follow. For instance, we drove out to Loreauville to search for Clifton Chenier's unmarked grave, and the book was just plain wrong. It told us to turn west on a road that only went east, giving us an impossible set of directions. We got lost, and spent an hour wandering rural backroads that had nothing at all to do with the highway numbers given in this book. On other trips, we learned the distances they give are sometimes way, way off, causing much confusion. The authors seem to be obsessed with food and eating, and know very little about the music and dance venues. Still, we couldn't have gotten along without it."
1,"Very,Very outdated","I just came back from Cajun country after using this book for my itinerary.I didn't check when this book was written before my purchase. I also didn't realize how much Katrina altered Louisiana.This was my third time to Louisiana. The last time was in 1989.That said, do not expect any tours in the book to exist anymore without calling.Restaurants and stores were gone or hours/days open are no longer valid. Again, make sure you call.I hope they update this book again. Just use the book in general and go with the flow! P.S. the old New Orleans is gone too. Won't return there."
2,Nothing special,"I'd read some perhaps obscure reviews of this one, which made it seem worthwhile. It's not. Pedestrian writing, but perhaps we read something like this for plot? Pedestrian plot. Just nothing there. I read Lady in the Morgue, and it was highly missable as well. So, new rule, avoid this author."
3,Too much ambiguity,"I find this book to be terribly frustrating. I have only read a few chapters in this book (a great deal of that material several times) and concepts that this book introduces are just not clear. the abnormal psychology book that Sue Sue and Sue wrote is phenomenal, every key concept is clearly defined, and it is immediately discussed and then supplemented with examples and extra information. With this Cognitive Psychology book I feel like every important concept is shrouded in fog. There are far too many examples and few terms are defined immediately and with accuracy. With this said, I would suggest this book for people that would like to supplement their reading, due to the massive amounts of examples in this book. For some, this book may be perfect, I just prefer a more direct approach that other psychology books offer."
2,Dismal,"This is by far the worst psychology textbook I have ever come across. It is poorly worded, repetitive, and abrasively organized. The material is interesting enough but it is largely an incredibly frustrating book to read."
1,Better texts on cognitive psychology exist.,"To echo some of the other comments, this text is not very well written nor organized. The authors skip over definitions and foundational concepts to build off of. This creates a frustrating experience to the reader. Many ambiguities exist and the connections between studies cited and the concept or theory in questions are often fuzzy. Since there are better cognitive psychology texts out there, I would advise against buying this book. Instead buy a different book and then dive into the primary literature to get a better handle on this very abstract and esoteric subject."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Unfortunately I HAVE to keep this book because it is required for a intro to cognitive psych class. My professor doesn't include everything in the lecture so we have to go through the book and fill in the wholes. This book is very hard to navigate. If the professor is teaching by the book it is OK but everything is paragraph form like a story. Some people this works for but for people that are trying to study for specific concepts it is difficult to navigate.Not to mention it is completely boring. Even if you are interested in cognitive psychology it is very bland writing and doesn't evoke interest at all.I hate to say this but there isn't enough pictures. Not because I like useless pictures in a book but there are SOOO many diagrams that can be used to illustrated the topics and they are WAY underutilized.If you're looking for something that will help you lose track of time, fall asleep with your book open, and turn your mind to mush, this is your book!"
5,Who knew Rubinstein was a great Liszt interpreter?,"I have owned this CD for several years, and it is one of the treasures of my collection. Everyone knows Rubinstein is a great (perhaps, the greatest) interpreter of Chopin. But he is not considered a great technician, so most would not think of him as the player of choice for Liszt. But he brings all the right things to this repertoire, including his wonderfully full 'orchestral' tone, his total mastery of pianistic color and shadings, and all the emotional energy and excitement that Liszt requires. I own the Cziffra recording of the Hungarian Rhapsodies, and find that pianist's playing very exciting, but I must say that Rubinstein's playing of the Rhapsodies is superior. The one (minor) drawback of this CD is that the recordings are monoral. However the old RCA Orthophonic sound is still rich and satisfying. You will not be disappointed with this CD."
1,"SCAM - ""new"" books come opened with the codes redeemed","Don't waste your time. Although the book, sold from Amazon, is listed as ""new"", the access code inside had already been redeemed when I received it. It did not come shrink wrapped - inside the front cover of the book it warns against purchasing it when it is not shrink wrapped.The book is useless without the code. If I had known Amazon was so deceitful I would have purchased a used book for a much, much lower price and purchased the access code seperately. I'm very disappointed in Amazon."
2,"Dawn Dale (above) review's her purchase, not the on-line labs","Please note that the reviewer above reviewed the used condiion of the lab book - and it's true that lab access codes are non transferable.The on-line labs are as good as on-line labs get. Which means that they are thoughtful, but in no way substitute for actual hands-on lab experiences."
5,Good Sturdy mugs.,"These are good sturdy mugs, and the right size. They have been used for coffee, and then washed in a dish washer every day for nearly a year now, with no chipping, cracking, staining or other issues, and they look so nice. It is just refreshing to use a real cup in the morning before switching to a travel mug."
5,Very Thought Provoking,A hard book to pin down; and an undeniably good read. Our Don is much more the Man of La Mancha than the object of Cervantez' pity. Worth your time if there's the least of Miniver Cheevy in your genes. Exquisitely written.
1,Whoops!,"Timothy Sullivan is the executive producer of Court TV and still brings news of many big trials to our screens. In Unequal Verdicts, his bestseller from 1992, dealing with the Central Park Jogger case, he ends his final chapter with a description of how ""a group of angry boys between the ages of 13 and 17 had used [a bar], along with a rock, a brick and their bare hands, to pound the promise out of [the victim's] future."" But let's not forget his final word on the subject: ""And on the streets ... lots of people wonder whether her boyfriend did it."" Could Sullivan have got it more wrong? He appears never even to have heard of Matias Reyes, the actual rapist, who was in the middle of a murder and rape spree in the same area at the time. And that final, gratuitous swipe at the Jogger's perfectly innocent boyfriend! Can we really believe a word this man tells us about guilt and innocence?"
1,"""Ain't what she used to be...""","For years I used a DYMO Label Maker 320 with no problem. Recently I upgraded to the model 400. I expected to plug it in, load the software from the enclosed CD, and start making lables. Boy, was I wrong. The 400 printed one lable and quit. No error message; no nothing. I went to the DYMO website, which told me to follow some directions to remove part of the installed software. I did what it said, but nothing improved. After several hours of aggrevation, I finally found what they call a ""firmware update"" that fixed the problem. In short, they put out a plug and play machine with software that doesn't work out of the box, and then did a poor job of telling the unsuspecting user how to upgrade it to fix their original mistake. Shame on you DYMO! I no longer recommend their lable maker."
1,Bad for your blood pressure,"I was all excited when my boss decided to get one of these to replace our typewriter labeling system. I remained excited until the first time I swtiched form one kind of label to another. After loading a diffrent label type I tried to print and nothing happened. Nothing happened the next 417 times I tried to print, either. Nothing happened after I tried all of the website's troubleshooting techniques. Then I called customer support. I put the phone on speaker and listed to hold music and promotional pitches for 1.5 hours before giving up. I hope they didn't throw away my typewriter..."
1,product didn't work,The label writer I received in the mail didn't work. It kept jamming the label into the dispensing mechanism.
1,Crappy Software,"Dymo, as with may companies is, IMHO, very bad at writing software. Although I love the functionality of the printer, I hate their software, which has given me many problems over time. Doesn't work with Excel, doesn't work with Quickbooks, just barely works with Outlook, which is where I do most of my label printing. So beware their latest version 8.0 for Office 2010. It crashed Excel, and made the whole Office 2010 programs load extremely slowly.I wish they would hire somebody decent to write their software, then this thing would be 5 stars. As it is, beware."
4,"Not bad, some quirks","I've owned this printer for a couple of years. Overall it is a pretty good printer. The quirks that this printer has is that it sometimes fails to see the end of a label after printing and spits out a blank label. You have to manually cut the label with a pair of scissors and refeed the labels in the printer. If you manually reload the label feed for each label printed you don't have that problem, but you have to refeed each and every time you want to print. Doesn't matter what kind of labels I print, it happens almost each time. Refeeding can be somewhat of a pain but not too bad. Be careful - it does have a tendency to wrap around the feed roller and jam."
1,Fails to print,"After using for over a month the priter, - for reasons unknown - fails to print - advances 1 label & shows printer errors thereafter"
1,Piece of junk,It has been 2 weeks and I have returned it twice. Software doesnt work and it doesnt print. Save yourself the stress and buy something else. NOT WORTH IT..
2,Wasted of money & time,"This is a terrible product. If you can get it to print, the labels look great, but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that I can find. I get an error that it didn't print but no reason why. I've installed on two different PCs, one is brand new and same thing happens. Software is also pretty useless.It also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive.The online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond."
3,Dymo doesn't work with Vista......,Worked great for a month. Manufacturer replaced 1 month later. Ebay was no help at all.Dymo Labelwriter 400 is not combatable with Vista. No upgrade patch or driver.
3,Labelwriter 400,It appears to be a little awkward to use compared to the Labelwriter XL. It worked early on and now I cannot get it to print my labels. Guess I should uninstall and then reinstall again to see if that will remedy the situation.
2,Beware reliability of power supply (based on earlier model 330),"I have two of the similar, earlier model 330, one at home and one at work. They have both suffered power supply failures, having survived through the warranty period but not much longer. Dymo's price for out-of-warranty repair is $75 each, which is a large fraction of the purchase price.It is possible, of course, that the newer model 400 is more reliable. Or not."
1,DYMO 400,"DYMO software gurus outdid themselves. I've had several other label machines (ie.CoStar) that were very simple to use and quick to produce one or two labels at a time. This new DYMO USB (plug & play) did not play with other devices on my USB ports, so I had to unplug 2 other devices to get it to work. Then, it takes forever to make a label and START the printing. Is is lightning fast to produce the label once it starts. It is probably great for printing large quantities of labels, but for my one or two at a time, it is painful. I returned to using my old CoStar hooked up to an old computer (I can't get software for my newer computer that works the old CoStar). The new DYMO is gathering dust."
2,Not that great; halfway solution,"I got this based on the high marks but I'm not impressed with its' performance. I think that some of the reviews are off-base.The application software is not that well designed; it is not intuitive to navigate (at least for me). Simple features you would expect from an application don't work like copy (using ctl + c) and paste (using ctl + v). I'm surprised that no label templates are provided for Microsoft word.The hardware is also not well-designed. It fails to print for no obvious reason with no debug information. It also mangles labels that do print by pulling up label separators during the printing process.Dymo technical support was not helpful; I used their website chat support and they were not able to help me make the printer work. I'd like to think that as an engineer, I'm fairly savvy about how things work, but I have not able to get the printer to perform well.I would not recommend this label printer."
1,Do Not Buy - Designed to Fail,"I've owned and re-owned many DYMO label printers while running my own home based business and use them for a variety of my product labels. Be warned, after owning and re-purchasing many of these in the hope one would last, I have given up. These will work fine until one small label gets wrapped around the feeder then they will massively print out blank labels or get jammed to where your only options are micro surgery with tweezers for many hours or re-purchasing a new printer.The rolls of labels are insanely expensive even if you try to get generic brand.I have even had sales people try to sway me from buying these because of the amount of problems they have. It's true please take it from someone who has used these waayy past the point of patience: These are HORRIBLE printers!"
3,Good label printer,"I utilize several of these in my office, and am slowly replacing older 300 series label printers as they fail. My only complaint is that occasionally one will stop communicating for no apparent reason, and there is no way to trouble shoot it. Typically a uninstall/reinstall of the hardware will fix the problem, but I have had a few USB ports go bad on me as well."
2,Reckless,"When Kat Adair dives into the river to rescue the object of her secret crush,David Turnberry, she quickly learns she has plunged into more than she bargained for. First, Hunter Macdonald tries to rescue her, needlessly. Then, she fakes amnesia to get closer to David for a little longer. However, that ruse does not last until the water gets hot. Then, she is rewarded with the chance to come along on an Egyptian expedition with the noble family. However, Kat is lovely, albeit not of the gentry. She could easily steal the hearts of the men along on the journey, including David, who is virtually promised to another. To save her from being expelled, Hunter marries her. It is never merely a convenient marriage, they do have a real attraction, but can it be love?** The amnesia plot that begins the book seems rather pointless, and it is never clear what Kat sees in David. However, this is a fairly entertaining read that moves quickly. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,Skinnier and zittier,Although this helps you reduce body fat I just can't stand taking the supplement because it makes me break out with deep cystic acne that are embarrassingly huge as well as very painful. It also makes your skin much more oily (although this same oil does give your hair a nice luster so there are some pros I guess).If you don't get acne maybe it's a good product for you but if you're sensitive to products that cause acne I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Second bottle of CLA with good results... at least for my wife!,"It is our second bottle of CLA.To be honest, I don't see any weight loss with the usage of this product, to the point that I just stopped taking it.My wife, on the other hand, REALLY believe that it is working for her diet.Who knows... May be it works for some, not for all."
5,Amazingg!,"This product is very good and easy to take. You won't feel any difference by taking it, but over time you will notice that you are losing the weight and trimming up."
1,Misleading label,"The labeling says ""MRM CLA 1250 High Potency."" One logically reads this to mean that 1250 mg of CLA are in each capsule. There is no other information given on the Amazon listing that would contradict this. Once I finally RECEIVED this and opened it, the label says that there actually is only 1000 mg of CLA in each capsule.So, if you are comparison shopping, like I was, to get the best price per dose, this labeling will lead you wrong. This is intentionally deceptive and I will be certain never to deal with this company again"
5,Stands out among CLA,"Can you beat an all natural weight loss supplement like this. I heard about it from a pal and it works for me. If it doesn't work for you, you are probably still cramming too many cheetos down your throat."
1,Wrong.,"Ordered this which stated it was 360 gels. I received 180 & was still charged for the whole 360 gels. The front of the bottle reads 180 & the barcode on the back read 360 - new. BUT - Amazon did indeed refund me my payment within a few days. Other than that, the product itself, the gel & CLA, is something I supplement with day by day."
1,not so great,most CLA works just not this stuff. it is not the best on the market. i shop at GNA exclusively and am sad that i wasted $$$$ on this brand.
1,Dr. Oz misses the boat again.,Where does Dr.Oz come up with this stuff. I use to like him and now feel he is just become Mr. Showmanship with junk he tells us to take that dont work.Save your money and just diet and exercise these pills dont work........
3,I wish I could say I've lost weight after using this product.,"Sadly, I haven't, and I can't notice any difference in my appetite at all. I'm sure the product quality is good, but there is NO panacea when it comes to losing weight."
3,Mehh,"I don't know if this product works for others, but it didn't for me. The price is right, but the quality is not as good as ON. I bought it twice, to give it a time, but I didn't see any changes while using it."
1,stuck together,recently recieved this product and they were all melted and stuck togther i tried putting them in the freezer and prying them out its not working im in afganistan and i dont have time to ship this back .. ill never order vitamins again .. very upset very
3,"was working but,","was working but, i had to get off of this because it was causing cyst-like acne on my face and back. it is too bad because i felt like this pill was cutting my abs nicely."
1,Didn't do anything,"Always hard to tell if these types of products work, but I can say that I felt no difference from these. I didn't lose any weight taking these. I have recently tried Oxy ProElite and have lost about 7lb in about a month. Also increased workouts and ate better, but at least I could feel the Oxy."
2,Causes bloating and gas,"I didn't take this long enough or consistently enough to notice if it made a difference in fat loss, which was my reason for taking it. One thing for sure though is it made me bloated and gassy, and made me burp a lot when I did take it."
3,Jury still out,"This product requires some time to see the results, I have only been using this for two months. Still waiting to see if this works."
2,No results,"I've been using this for more than two weeks and so far no results. I started taking it be ukase I hit a plateau two myths ago after losing just 9 lbs. I'm still 20lbs over weight. I measure my portions at dinner, eat salad and baked chicken for lunch usually and omelet for breakfast. No bread sometimes a little pasta for dinner but that is no more than twice a week. I drink 3- 16 bottles of water a day. I exercise for 1 hour 5 days a week. my vices are coffee with cream once or twice a day and heresy chocolate kisses 6 pieces btwn lunch and dinner. I cut out the kisses when I started using the CLA and take two tablets per meal. I'm very discouraged. Will contine to use the product and post an update in 2-3 more weeks. If you are using this product please write a review. It takes one minute and doesn't have to be lengthy. it helps your fellow consumers decided whether or not to purchase."
4,Star rug,"This is a very nice rug and will go with most styles of decor. It arrived in a good time; no waiting around and it was well packed; however, when you first get a rug like this you have to lay it flat for a bit to get the right drape, so to speak, if you are going to hang it on the wall; it really looks great there. This rug and the seller are highly recommended."
2,"Great product, price too high",Terrific product that really does what it purports to do. Leaves your skin literally sparkling! I use it on my face s well as body. Has a minty feel and smell. It is good to use an exfoliation particularly if you are using a self tanner. The only reason I gave this product a 2* is because I found it at Macy's website (same size) for $22. That is a significant difference in price!I was surprised because I usually buy at amazon because I have prime and I usually get a better deal but it is always a good idea to check prices elsewhere.
3,good potential....,"Kathleen Morgan is one of my favorite authors, so my disappointment with this book was sharper than it would have been had I not had such high expectations! There was so much potential for a GREAT story -- interesting characters, fascinating plot -- but the ending seemed hastily written and desperately short on sustaining detail. Oh well, maybe the next one will be better...."
3,sad that author is not finishing this series,"I read this book a number of years ago, and waited for the second book. I finally went on the author's website, and she stated that she was not finishing this series, so I am VERY disappointed about that as I always like to know ""the rest of the story."" So, I would not recommend this book for that reason."
4,Kathleen Morgan is gifted!,"Kathleen Morgan is gifted!! This is the 3rd of her books that I have read. Right away, I connected with the characters. I felt their disappointments, their yearnings, their feelings of unworthiness, etc. I struggled putting this book down.I do have to say, however, without giving the ending away that I was extremely disappointed with the end and was left with my heart breaking. I hope that The Stone of Power addresses the unresolved emotions that both the characters and the readers are left with."
1,This Sucks,Dont Ever by this....I Threw it away i could have sold it back but why torture any one with that trash
3,Get it at the library,"Although I found some of the sex scenes repetitive and somewhat repellent, I continued reading in hopes that the past of ""M"" would be revealed. This hope was disappointed, only brief glimpses were allowed. I think this is part of the reason I didn't make a deep connection with the characters, I didn't know them well enough.The story line was interesting, as was the obsessive downward spiral of the relationship. The ending was ambiguous, but certainly fit the scope of the novel."
2,"Silly and sick, but fun","This is no feminist manifesto. It's clumsily written and the ""shocking"" sexual situations are the most common that you could imagine. Still, it's a lot of fun, a guilty pleasure with some mystery and grace- just not much. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would read anything this author wrote even though I might hide it under the bed if I had dinner guests."
2,In a word...,"Tedious. It's rare that I speed through a book solely for the purpose of getting to the end of it so I can throw it down and get to a better book, but this was certainly the case with ""Lunch"". This formula has been done before, more engagingly and intricately, by better writers. The author's attempt at provocation fails miserably and the book reads like an over-dramatized romance novel with a buffoon for a central character. The author also has a tendency to build up to nothing which I first noticed in ""Belladonna"", (which was, nevertheless, better written and more engaging than ""Lunch"", due to the narrator's viewpoint of the story and a more developed plot and central characters). This novel may have been quite the scandal if it were written in 1940, but it certainly doesn't cut it today. Lunch? No thanks."
3,Children's concerns.,"The preface of this book talks about it being information about enzymes for all ages when in fact it discusses mainly issues having to deal with children with autism or autism spectrum disorders. It is not written in a consise manner and information is hard to pull from all of the anecdotes and parental, mostly motherly, comments. I would not recommend it to adults seeking digestive and enzyme information."
4,Review of Mahfouz' 'Akhenaten',"Mahfouz examines the most mysterious monarch in the only way appropriate: through a variety of voices expressing various opinions. What emerges is a murky, uncertain image of a ruler both loved and hated. This was a smart and fair approach to a political biography of a man about whom there still exists many, many questions. The translation was apt, though not especially poetic."
2,Hmmmmm,"This is an engrossing book but entirely historically inaccurate. It has fallen into the pit so common with writers on Akhenaten in that it tries to romanticise this king. First of all, Akhenaten did believe in the Aten, that was his one and only G-d. Nefertiti was not Akhenaten's only love. He is known to have had many wives including his daughter, Merytaton. Nefertiti probably died, and Smenkhare did suceed Akhenaten. He was not a pacifist and is known to have fought some very successful campaigns. Besides this however, the book provided some interesting reading, and though I disagree with its interpretation of the sun king, one should read it anyway, at least if one also reads some Alan Gardiner to unbias him."
3,Not quite a plaster saint,"While I did find the book interesting, Mr. Mahfouz paints Akhenaten as some kind of plaster saint. (None of the books on Amarna that I've ever read portray things with historical accuracy). The Heretic comes across rather woodenly. Akhenaten was a human being, neither totally good or totally bad; his behavior was a mixture of good and bad. One figures that he must have had a sense of humor, and occasionally picked his nose, or whatever. Seems that authors tend to portrary the Heretic Pharaoh was either a saint or a monster instead of a man.He and Nefertiti did truly love each other, but he did have a harem and probably did ""visit"" these other women (one of whom was Tut's mother). Apparently, he did marry his three other daughters. (The cultural mores as to what was acceptable behavior for an Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaoh were rather different from modern sets of values).Is anyone ever going to accurately tell the Amarna story?"
1,"Beware!!!!!!! not for TV,VHS, or DVD players","As others state this is a 6 pin S-video, not for use with TV, VHS, or DVD S-Video plug in.Newer TV'S dont have S-Video anymore, so you must use the poor picture quality RCA cables on most VHS players. Was hoping this would convert S-Video to Componet cables which TV'S have but wont. TV is a 4 pin. Seller should disclose this in the description. I wasted my money."
2,Does't work with iPod dock,"I got this to hook up my iPod dock (5G 30GB iPod) to my TV via component video. Alas, no video appears on the TV. I know the inputs and composite cable work... Maybe I'm doing something wrong here, but it seems like this should work. The iPod dock works with straight S-video cable to the TV."
1,An Ironically Poor Instruction Book on Instructions,"I am a big fan of Wurman's Information Anxiety, where he does a great job of using his text and format to illustrate the points he makes about information. This work is the opposite. It is ironic that a supposed how-to on instructions does not get to any hows by page 54, where I quit reading. This is an almost 400 page tome, and considering the author's reputation as an information presentation expert, it was frustrating to not find quickly, at-a-glance, the locale of the meat of this book. I was plodding through it sure that I would refute other reviewers low ratings, but after falling asleep the second time while reading it, I threw in the towel."
5,The best First Person Shooter available today.,There is simply no comparison to planetside. Planetside does require a good system for the best performance. However the game works so well. 16 on 16 FPS shooters can't compare to 100 vs 100. 13 continents per world to wage war on. Unlimited certification combinations. 10 minutes from patch to actually being able to play the game. Level playing field. A battle rank 1 character is the same as a battle rank 20 character in terms of armor and health. This game rocks hard core.
1,Bad,"If you dont have an extremely good computer you cant play this game. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST 512mb and a nvidia4 graphics card or an ati radeon 9700. I have and ati radeon 9700 pro and 256 mb and it was VERY LAGGY. I was only shotting at one person to. Worst of all You have to pay 10 a month if you subscribe all year and like 20 dollars a month if you play per month. The vehicles are cool and the weapons are ok. I do not suggest getting this game. Why would you pay like 120 dollars a year for a game that is not good? I wasted 50 dollars on the game, don't make the same mistake I did."
4,great stuff from bruce,"Another wonderful and beautifully detailed bookfrom Bruce about the Beatles on Apple.My only quibble would be,as an English guy,the English releases of these records Bruce choses not to cover,and,for the same reason that Bruce has such a passionfor the U.S. release's that he is so familiar with,i badly need the same coverage on the UK releases!as,apart from the actual music,there's a whole differencein the artwork,the sleeves,the printing,the smells and textures!i wouldn't complain if we were talking about an American band here,obviously,but these records did originate in the UKand those were the versions (including all the artwork)the Beatles approved and releasedso therefore these books are always missing something to memaybe an English guy should finish the job!but great stuff anyway!"
2,"Semi-Interesting Anecdotes, Not-So-Crisply Told","This is not a bad book: It's just very sluggisly paced without much style. In the hands of real sportswriters it could have been a gas. The authors are far too reverential: Cooperstown to them is some kind of holy shrine, and anyone with even a smidgen of skepticism is an Unbeliever. Hey, it's already late 1998. Why write like it's 1958?"
4,Nice Anecdotes,"Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf have compiled over 300 pages of major league anecdotes and trivia, dating from pre-Civil War to the modern era. The authors begin with Alexander Cartright and Abner DoubleDay, and just keep on going. There's a lot here in these readable pages, from personalities like Cap Anson, Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Willie Mays, Pete Rose, etc., to some of the more more successful and more colorful teams, key World Series', etc. The book covers each era, from the post-civil war teams of the later 1800's, to the dead ball era, the roaring 1920's, the Depression and War years, postwar baseball, expansion, etc. Hard core fans will recognize many of the anecdotes, but there's so many here that some are bound to be new. Actually, I wish the authors had included more pages of information, but this still makes good reading for baseball fans.Thinking fans should also read Okrent's NINE INNINGS, a dated but superb look at baseball and baseball strategy."
2,Great book for baseball fans on the east coast,"This book does a great job of telling stories about Yankees, Red Socks, and the Yankees.This book has a lot of history and, unfortunately, a lot of actual quotes (profanity and all)! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, I just can't let my son read it.There was more listed in the book about Steinbrenner's early years as the Yankees' owner than the decade of the Big Red Machine and the oldest professional baseball team combined. I admit that I am a Reds' fan."
4,The PBS Series Without Photos,"For those of us who love the history of baseball as much as the game itself, this is a, ""must get"".I found all the anecdotes from the PBS Ken Burns documentary ""Baseball"" here plus a bunch that didn't make it. (You may recall, that Daniel Okrent was heavily featured in the PBS series)The only missing element that would cause me to bump my ratings to 5 stars would be(you guessed it) photos.With the unearthing of Charles Conlon's negatives they would have a trove of other 18,000 images to choose from - most of which have yet to be published in this half of the century. (Only a fraction of these incredible images made it into the Abram's book, ""The Golden Age of Baseball"")Of course, this would drive the cost of the book up and possibly detract from the wonderful stories here - I wonder out loud if it isn't perfect just the way it is...Never the less, you will be all the poorer if this book in not in your baseball library, photos or not!"
5,Excellent book...takes a totally unique look at the Bible.,"Paul Winchell pulls together all the various aspects of belief in the Bible, not in God, and shows the varied descrepencies within the Bible. Including the different accounts of the same events by the gospel writers, the vaired points that could be considered hypocrisy within the text of the old Testament, the ""creation"" of the Bible by early Popes, and problems with man's translation and passing on information over time. Basically the book presents a view that the Bible is ""tainted"" because it has been in the hands of mankind and has become altered or distorted from the word of God. God himself, and belief in Him, is held in high esteem. But living your life based on the Bible and a literal translation is found to be flawed. And throughout the book Winchell uses his gift of honesty about his life, problems, and humor to bring this information to the reader."
1,Disappointing,"It's unfortunate that Mr. Winchell didn't check out the other side of the story before writing this book. For example, the ""discrepencies"" in the Bible are only different accounts, not disagreements. They don't contradict each other at all. In fact, had the Gospel accounts been identical collusion would have been suspected, and rightly so. Mr. Winchell, unfortunately, has now learned the hard way that he was wrong."
1,"Athens, America","I found this book by search for the event that inspired it because years ago, I lived in Iowa City and remember the tragedy and the inexplicable behavior of intelligent citizens in its aftermath. I was interested in reading a novel that was inspired by events that I had had a front row seat in viewing. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. The author was too close to the situation and sacrificed a good story for too much unnecessary detail. The true story is one that should be told--either as fiction or non-fiction but it needed a storyteller that did not have personal ties to it. This book could have been improved with a strong editor."
3,cars,"my little guy was really looking forward to receiving these three cars, but we received three different ones, not the ones pictured, and it was a set he already had."
4,Great toy,Great for the die cast car collector or for the young bot or girl to play with came in nice packaging
3,Was Expecting Better,"This book was kind of boring. I never thought that I would actually say this, but Maria annoyed me in this book. She seemed to be very insecure, and self-abosorbed, and to me she hardly considered Ken's feelings, but in some ways the same things could be said about Ken. I have to agree with some of the other reviewrs, the Conner things is getting old, please resolve it soon. I hate to say it, but I really could care less about the character of Conner, all he is about is self-pity, Liz needs to find someone new. I didn't like the Jermey and Jade thing."
1,Ugh!,"This book was awful. It rushed through everything WAY too quickly. The Conner/acholic dilemma sums up to a huge confrontation WITH his sister which COnner hates, and walks out. Ken and Maria break up. Will refuses to see Melissa which makes her totally bummed. You have to feel sorry for her. Oh, and you don't know if Jeremy and Jade are back together or not. Jade thinks they are, but I don't think so because Jeremy is flirting with Jessica full time. There's MAJOR confusion there. Also, Jade FINALLY gets fired. I would only recommend this book so that you could be caught up in the series."
3,good book,"this was a god book and all except for te fact the they are making maria sound sooo insecure about herself and her realationship with ken, and that whole melisa thing....i mean come on, can you say insecure? who would choose melissa over maria? other than will. but i am really glad ken got his position back because he way deserved it...i think its time for him to write olivia another letter though. they make it seem as though..hey i have maria now, who needs olivia? during this whole book, i kept thinking he was going to look up into the stands and see olivia, kinda lke he did in his dream, you know?"
3,Makes a lot of assumptions of the reader,"The book meanders through a portion of Minitab and Six Sigma. There are technical terms that are frequently not defined. There are suggestions for analysis that could be performed in certain situations, but no steps are provided. I'm a BB in our organization and had to consult my training materials to tie all the pieces together. I'm glad I bought this book because it caused me to do this extra legwork and I re-learned a lot.Statistics for Six Sigma Made Easywas a much better book for my intended need."
1,Many flaws with this desk,"I just bought this desk and I'm going to dismantle it and throw it away.I don't know where to start. I knew that a desk sold by wal-mart could not be of good quality but I went against my better judgement and now I'm out 600 bucks.the top of my hutch sinks in because the measurements are not accurate. The L piece that connects to the main part of the desk is impossibly hard to get flush. Also, the glass doors are almost impossible to line up accurately. I loved the contemporary look of this desk but do yourself a favor, buy something else."
4,Great and yet...,"Love my iPod so far, but miss the remote control my old CD player had and have had surprising number of connection/crashing problems with my laptop."
5,80 GB video iPod - worth the price.,"What a great product. Lives up to all my expectations completely. Video display is surprisingly easy to view - including TV programs, movies, and music videos. My favorite viewing is for my photo collection, though."
5,The Apple 80GB Ipod,"Though I haven't had it long, the 80GB Ipod that I purchased from Amazon has proved to be exactly what I wanted. I have imported my entire CD collection onto it plus some music that I purchased from Itunes--11,530 songs, to be exact--and have used up only half of the memory. On a recent road trip we were caught in a snowstorm and were on the road for over six hours. I had purchased adapters for use in the car so I put the Ipod on ""shuffle"" and let it go. One hundred songs later we were home but had had the luxury of a wide variety of music plus the added modicum of some surprise which I find superior to the ""one CD at a time"" routine. Overall, I am quite happy I own the Ipod.Jim Kearney"
4,Great Product,"I received the 80GB Black Video iPod for a present. Actually, I wouldn't have paid for it myself, but as a gift a great product to receive. It has frozen on me once and after I reset it, it has worked great ever since. I use it to run and work out with and I see others using iPods as well. Definitely a hot product on the market, with a recommendation of the JBL music dock. Great battery life and I also use it to back up all my files on both of my computers!! The down side, is you have to manage songs yourself and I wish it was done automatically, i.e., genere, artist, year, etc..."
1,Amazon is not shipping this item at the old pricing,"I ordered this at the old pricing ($349.99) on 10/18. ""Delivery estimate: October 31, 2007 - November 6, 2007.Then I just got an email stating that ""Estimated arrival date: 01/04/2008 - 01/07/2008""I am surprised. It does not seem right. Especially with their new pricing and that they currently state that there are 2 in stock."
3,Not a good replacement for my Rio Karma,Rio Karma (Rio is out of business now) was (and still is) probably the best mp3 player around. My Karma is still working but aging.Got this iPod as a replacement. Returned - no comparison to the Karma. The iPod is shinier but functionality-wise is not very good. Will wait until my Karma dies and then get something else.
5,Ipod 80 GB,I gave this to my son for Christmas and it is his favorite. I am not into Ipod or music but he thinks it is the greatest thing ever. says it is easy to use but that the software is sometimes hard to figure out and doesn't work easily all the time.
2,"Bulky, heavy, and missing a lot good features","Bulky, heavy, and missing a lot good features. It can not sync with more than 1 computers (you have to copy the entire image (stupid)."
5,great!,"All I know is that I bought this for a corporate present, but Ipod is the best qhen it comes to MP3 players."
5,Just Amazing,Being an older adult I was blown away with the marvels of this little machine. I have bought several audio books and just love it!
5,Ordered 2 of these,"1 for myself, 1 for my daughter, we both love these IPODS and get manyoohs and awes from people!!! With being able to download movies, plus the music and games, these are great for taking on trips.WE LOVE THEM!!!!"
5,I SWORE I'D NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE,"The iPod 80GB is everything it claims to be. Take it out of the box, charge it, put the ear buds in and listen. That's all you need to know about an item that seems so complex. I have now owned every iPod including the new 8GB Nano (Don't even ask). When I take My iPod on the plane or into the doctors office, I'm carrying 5700 songs in my palm and realize I WIN!"
3,Why has the price gone from $349.99 to 589.62 for the last 10 days?,"This is amazing. I ordered that item 5 days ago. It came the classic verion instead this, I was mad, I had to return the ipod. Then I saw the price was with $230 more. What has happened for the last few day here?"
4,I don't like to be a public billboard,"I just got my first Ipod--the 80 gig--and I can't wait to get it all set up. I'm sure I'll love it (til I lose it or drop it). However, I was annoyed to see that, although you ordered a black Ipod, they still send you the annoying white cord and earphones that say, ""Look everyone! I have an Ipod!"""
2,"Not like new, and motherboard failed after weeks","Unfortunately, the IPOD, though, it had its original box was not ""like new"". I bought it for my 16 year old son and after 2 weeks of normal teenage boy misuse, it failed completely and no longer can be used. The price was much lower than others being offered so I guess you get what you pay for, a lesson learned, mostly for my son."
4,Great Unite - Material Coul be Better,The product keep being as good as the original with some great improvements like the more brilliant screen.It would be good tha finally Apple change some of the material to avoid the actual easy scraching. It's absolutely recomendable that you buy it at the same time with a preteccion accesory and never use it with out it.
5,iPod gets better and better,"Only minor improvements to this 5.5 generation upgrade, but the extra space and improved battery life come in very handy. This is the best value iPod on the market in my opinion."
4,"Not 80, but 73","The iPod is awesome, everybody knows that. But I think they should be honest and tell the truth; it's not 80GB, it's a little bit more than 73. That's almost 7GB that you might be counting on and that are not available.That's the first thing anybody should know about iPods."
5,could not live without it anymore,"The extra room on this is terrific. I have downloaded several movies, hundreds of songs, music videos and pictures. With additioanl cables, I can watch downloaded movies on my regular television and bought a new stereo that lets me plug my iPod into it and play music over the stereo. I also bought a device so I can play the iPod over my car stereo. Being able to play songs and movies on other devices makes purchases from iTunes even more worth the money. This is truly a great product. Oh, but I have not been able to sync my Outlook contacts and datebook and had a lot or problems trying."
3,It's OK,"It's OK... not too great.... had to get a new MP3 player to replace my old one. and this seemed to be the best one out there... using a Bose QC2 I compared it to the iRiver H340 and the sound quality was just the same though the iRiver H340 is several years old already.The screen is pretty nice though and the quality is unexpectedly good.Still hate the fact that all the MP3 players out there, no longer have the external hard drive format of the H340, the Archos etc... that gives the user the ability to build custom structures in storing the music files."
2,"Great for Audio (when not frozen), TERRIBLE FOR VIDEO","I have the 80gb Generation 5.5 iPod with video. I have had it for about a month now, & every time I have ever tried to play a video it would play for about a second, then get corrupted & freeze. When I go ""back"", trying to get to the menu, the entire iPod then FREEZES & no matter what you do it is completely unresolvably FROZEN until it runs out of juice and you plug it in to recharge it. This is pretty awful, since this is undoubtedly shortening the life of the battery considerably. Worse than that, the only fix anyone online has had for me so far was ""Wait until the battery dies and then recharge it & it'll be fine"", which I was - you can imagine - less than pleased with hearing, since I'd figured that much out frustratingly on my own. There has to be a better answer than that, or I'm going to feel pretty ripped off."
3,Love it but would not sync with my PC!,"Amazon shipped right on time, price was right, it looks gorgeous, and is great to use while traveling. VERY happy with the purchase part of the product via Amazon. One might think watching shows on this would be difficult with a smaller screen, but the clarity is so great it rocks! The issue that made it 3 stars was that this thing would not sync with my PC for ANYTHING. Apple;s lovely customer service is available until 6 PM, so if you work, just forget about getting help with your $350 new product. The store won't touch it if you work with a PC, so that's fun. About 60 people on iTunes chat had the same errors as me, with zero resolution from Apple. LUCKILY, I had a crafty friend who figured out the issue, and it now works fine! But, still, I spend $350 and can't use it for 3 weeks with no help from Apple? Not good."
2,Eh...,It came really really late- not a huge fault but it was very scratched and had sticky stuff on the back of it.. it was also engraved with a name which I didn't know about
2,by Flash based technology not Harddisk based.,"There are many reviews I read here complaining about the Ipod freezing up after about a year. Well duh - it uses a hard disk which spins around with a little ""needle"" to read the tracks, so any vibrations/movement while the thing is working can potentially damage the hard disk. So guess what - you can have it in your car, on the bus, on the train or in a plain but eventually the hard disk will decide it's had enough. If you carry your player around a lot I highly recommend a flash based player. I see people with these hard disk based players on the bus and really that's a no-no."
4,iPod lives up to the expectations,"Even though I purchased 80 GB, I wonder if I ever used this much space. My recommendation is don't waste your money for 80GB. Get a lower capacity one."
2,FIX THIS DEVICE!,"Want to buy this new one, as my old one is crapping out, (the central ""select"" button is wearing out), but cannot quite bring myself to part with the money. Should my $300+ device be worn out in a year? And what about the battery that is not really replaceable and is too small, and the problems with iTunes?I was looking for an improvement in the new iPods, not just refinements in the size! iTunes does not work well. It garbles information, esp when downloading cds, but sometimes at random, and now refuses to play whenever another program is running. The battery needs to be a rechargeable/renewable. It could just as easily take AA batteries, or a clip type battery like old cell phones? How about making the unit compatable with other providers?If Apple is determined to have it all; service, hardware,operating system, consumer sales, then it had better get it's act together. It's not enough to just show up."
5,ipod,"The ipod was in a brand new box, the product was defect free and was received way ahead of scheduled date, even though i had selected ground shipping, I am very pleased buying this product through amazon.com"
2,ipsi,"I just got my Ipod 80GB when I was vacation and so far I like. You set alarms, use it as a stop watch, play games add notes, to do lists, add ebooks(still in the works) make it a hard drive add contacts work a calender and watch movies with the addition to listen to music the only things it does'nt do is go on the internet and fetch the paper."
2,ok....,"sound quality is great. video picture is amazing. have had it for about 2 weeks now and i keep it in my jacket pocket when i walk around with it. it is scratched beyond belief already just sitting in my pocket. i dont know how cause my jacket is soft and nothing else in the pocket. screen is badly scratched. nice chrome looking back is horrible now. had to go out and buy a case. also it freezes 50% of the time i try using it. have had to hold center button and menu together so many times already. having problems trying to listen to it and charge. it charges off the computer and the ""do not disconnect"" message always come up not letting me play music and charge at the same time. would be good if not for these annoying things. for 330$$$ i think they should be able to fix these problems."
5,apple 80 GB video ipod,"Great product. The apple company is a fine company who gives lots of support for this product. I am completely satisfied with all aspects of the product, the delivery and the purchase price. Thank you so much."
4,good condition,iPod is in really good condition. few minor scratches but nothing I wasn't told about. works great came with a few extras no complaints.
2,bad battery,"This ipod is a totally reliable product. The only problem is the battery. After about a year and a half use, it lasts for about 3 hrs. before needing a recharge. Then pay up for an expensive new one."
5,iPod Video 5.5 is excellent,"I have been extremely happy with my 5.5 gen iPod video. I use it daily, mostly for listening to music and audiobooks. However, the screen is amazingly clear and bright for watching videos, playing games, etc. I am also very pleased with the battery life in this model. Highly recommended!"
5,ipod 80GB,A 15-year-old friend of the family from PRC China bought this while visiting and is utterly delighted with it.
5,Apple 80 GB iPod video Black (5.5 Generation),Gift for brother waiting for him to come home. Im messed with it some might just have to get me one. I like the crhome on it to.
5,A Wonderful Gift....That Keeps On Giving!!!,"I received the Apple 80 GB iPod for Christmas, and it has exceeded all my expectations. I can't imagine ever running out of space on this wonderfully simple-to-operate marvel. Kudos to Apple and to my family for buying me the perfect gift! Buy an Apple 80 GB iPod for your loved ones, and all of your wildest dreams will come true!"
1,Amazon uses shady company.,Wall Street Photo is a SUPER SHADY company. What company almost doubles the cost of an ipod 80. Amazon is tarnishing its image by using this comnpany. Just a few days ago Amazon itself was selling the 80 for $349. Of course amazon doesn't respond to complaints.Get it elswhere. My loyalty to Amazon is now in jeopardy.
2,BEWARE OF iPOD HARD DRIVES,"I have purchased the iPods since the first day they came out and I have to tell you that it is a love/hate purchase.I am on my 4th iPod with a hard drive and they have all crashed within 1 -2 yrs. Now that the Nano has come out which is not a hard drive as the iPods they are more durable. Of course, with the Nano you only get a max of 8GB but I am going to take that and live with it as I am so tired of having the large iPods crash. I am not up for spending $300 plus every two yrs on this kind of device. Apple really lacks in customer service on this product. FYI: I have been and still am an Apple advocate as I love their products but the iPods with the large hard drives ARE A SERIOUS ALERT~!!!! If you are new to this type of purchase and have a concern for where you put your money, then buy the 8 GB Nano as there is not a hard drive issue there. BEWARE OF HARD DRIVE iPODS!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Ipod 80 gb.,Unfortunately the battery would not hold a charge. But the retun service was excellent. No hassles and the refund was made immediately upon receipt of the returned Ipod. I would use this company again.
3,Very nice but not as well built as the 4G and less accessories,"Apple has actually raised the price buy making you buy the AC adapter seperately. There are no longer any foam covers for the earbuds included either. The do give you a fabric case but I can't see anyone using it much as you cannot operate the iPod controls when it is in it.While it is a nicely built machine, the 4th generation 60G appears to be more solidly built. Also, I have had to reset the software twice in two weeks. With the 4G it was twice in about 2 years and I used it more often."
5,Wrong price shown,"Amazon shows one price (234.87) on landing page, then shows more expensive price (332.98) when you go to order. This has been like this for days. If you push them, they have to give you the deal. Can't believe they haven't fixed this. Good luck for you. Bad luck for Amazon."
5,Protect Your Sreen,"Excellent product, however, I suggest you buy the protective plastic film to cover the screen."
4,good value for money,"this is a very good product. as it is, Apple is known for their ground-breaking and reliable products. this iPOD looks really sleek and the video quality is quite good. i wish it could have been smaller though but with 80 gigs of memory, i'm not going to whine too much about that. it is worth almost every penny of the price."
1,Warranty and no more!,"Had an ipod that stopped worked exactly after the warranty period. Apple then explains to you that you cannot pay to have it repaired, it is not in their policy!You can try to find somebody to open it.Other friends had the same problem, end of the warranty, and the ipod stops working/be warned."
1,Who are they kidding?,"This has got to be a JOKE. As has been stated below, the pricing for this item is preposterous. I came here to buy the 5.5-gen iPod since I read many, many reviews branding the new Classic line an afterthought at best. How is it that this 5.5-gen product costs OVER $200 more than the most updated iPod out there? Give me a break, Amazon."
1,"Amazon, Please Update Your Price","With the advent of the new 160GB iPod, which Amazon.Com also sells, the retail price of this model is now only $249. I'm surprised that Amazon has not updated the price."
4,Great player,"I had this player for a year, it was dropped a submerged in water and didn't even shut off continued to work perfectly for another year, then I left it in my work truck in -47 degree C weather and it died of hard drive failure with the click click click sound of death. Overall an excellent player, superior sound quality, durable as all hell and worth the money."
5,Rockbox it,I would not have gotten this player except for the fact that it can be rockboxed (www.rockbox.org) and it sounds fantastic with the replacement firmware. I am currently playing FLAC and OGG files.
5,Love my ipod,I love my ipod 80 gb. I owned a 30 gb before it got stolen so I upgraded to 80 gb. battery lasts forever with this one since they put in that new screen that is brighter. I watched 8 hours worth of video on one charge. Have owned it 3 weeks and only charged it 3 times and I use it alot everyday.
1,- NO FIREWIRE DATA TRANSFER !!!!!!,"ALL of the ipods (except for the Nano and this 5th generation model) allowed for transfer of data via Firewire. In fact, some earlier versions even came with firewire cables. Considering the fact that Apple computers have many firewire ports and emphasizes the value of firewire, it's a [...]that this 'best' version doesn't support firewire data transfer.[...]"
1,The iPod that couldn't.,"The rating should be ""0"" for something that wouldn't function properly. Just before Christmas, I purchased this 80gig. ipod and the Altec Lansing IM9 for it to fit into from Costco. I had been wanting something to hold a lot of lesson plan material (40-50 cds)and maybe some music. After downloading the Apple info from their site, I tried to copy all my cds over to the ipod. Unfortunately, it would only play just a few lessons from the first disc and none of the others. The controls also seemed very sensitive at some times, and balky at others. After trying several more times (without success)to get my mp3s all transferred over, I felt that this unit must be defective. For almost $400, one would expect a better quality control. Had to return the speakers too, since they were dedicated to the unit. But what I did hear from them was great! Judging from most of the postitve responses here, I may try it again. Looks like Amazon has the better price now too!"
3,Average,The delivery of the product is very slow....Amazon sucks big time.Ipod seems to be OK.The packing was very bad.
1,Moving on to Bigger and Better,"I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant ""let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel"" navigation ""aid"" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion."
4,iPod,"This is really a great item with a couple of flaws. I purchased a subscription to Audible books at the same time and love to listent to all the books I cannot find time to read. However, there is no way to bookmark the books so every time I want to listen to music instead of the book I have to go back and spend 10 to 15 minutes finding my place in the book. Also, they have made using it difficult to learn. In addition, why do you have to download stuff into iTunes to then upload it into the iPod. That is too many steps for the 21st century."
4,Great watch,"Really nice watch and fantastic featuresAnalog/digital timeCalendarAlarmDual Time modeStopwatchAll of this for just about $15It's EXTREMELY light and thinThe wrist strap is very slim and fits great.Cons-The area where the strap attaches to the face of the watch feels very weak and flimsy.The way to change the Analog time is very weird and time consuming. On the right side of the watch has a ""hidden"" button.When you slightly tap it, the minute hand moves 1 minute and when you hold down on it it SLOWLY changes time.My problem with this is when you accidentally hit the button, you have to hold it down for at least 5-8 minutes to bring the time back to normal >_<Such a painBut nice watch overall."
3,Nice cheap watch but face scratches easily,"It's hard to go wrong with Casio watches. For a value watch, this model is excellent and the strap is durable and very adjustable. The only problem is how easily and badly the face gets scratched. Some scratches wear off eventually, but the deeper ones remain. Also, I wish the face wasn't so light-reflective, but you can't have everything with a watch at this price. It is just fine for everyday use in a non-physical setting, such as an office or school, but avoid wearing it for any kind of physical activity requiring arm use."
2,crystal not as advertised,i purchased this watch and it is a great watch. the crystal is advertised as a mineral crystal and it is not. two days after i purchased it i had a scratch in the crystal. i took it to a jeweler and he told me the crystal is not mineral it was acrylic [plastic] he advised me to return the watch. he said to change to crystal to mineral would exceed the price i paid for the watch.
1,this watch is terrible,Nine years ago I had a Casio watch very similar to this one. It worked great and lasted a couple of years.This watch is terrible. It stopped working the first time that I took it to swim laps. The seal was bad and it leaked.I mailed it back to the company at my own expense and they wanted $15 to fix it. I shouldn't have wasted time and money mailing it back but I wanted to see the company's reaction since I couldn't be the first one to have this happen. Casio's 'customer service' is a joke.Spend a few dollars more and get a Timex.
2,Ugh,"Yes, it's a cheap watch.But even for a cheap watch, it's cheap. I'll give it to a bum or a kid or something."
1,Death after one swim - 1 star (was 4 stars),"November 1, 2007""Nice and good deal watch, but no light""Surprisingly nice and good deal watch, but no light ... Very good basic analog-digital watch with low price (paid $12.95). The mineral plastic/glass face seems easy to be scratched. The watch has all features as Amazon describes on the Web Site. The watch is one of my favorite collection-watches. One star is taken off for no light and no second hand.Updated - Oct. 2009A few days ago, I wore the watch (in this review) in the indoor pool, the watch died. Very disappointed. I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 1 star.I used to have a very similar Casio watch which lasted for 4 years approximately until I lost it. This watch was worn in my daily swim, and at the beach. I used this watch daily ..."
3,Good watch but scratches easily,I got my watch and it scratched within 4 days.Btw Should I try and return or It maybe just wait and see if the cracks go away
2,Casio AW49HE-1AV Ana-Digi Watch,"The price is right on this product but it is so hard to use. I have had my Casio AW49HE-1AV for about four months and to tell you the truth, I don't even know where it even is right now. Why? The digital display is so small and with the gold background and the dark LCD numbers, is very hard to see. It is a good idea and looks good but for practicality and useage is not a good deal. With the cost of these sport watches as low as they are, I have replaced mine with one that has a larger number display and a lighter background. One day when I move, which will be in the far distant future as I own my home, I might find it again while packing. You know how that is."
4,Casio Watch,"Good price, works well, although I had a little trouble setting it up. I needed a back up watch and this fills the bill, and even more. Suitable for women as well as men."
3,Like the product but get a band problem,I like the product but after one week I had a problem with the band (belt).I contacted the seller sent a picture and expalin the problem.I got a total refund avoding me to re-ship the watch.Thanks to the guys.
2,Misleading title,"This book is misleadingly titled.""Latin Can Be Fun"" suggests a work that should contain more actual humour than this one does.Instead, this curious little book seems to be a very conventional foreign language phrase book that just happens to be in Latin. The author apparently considers this concept to be enough of a joke that little effort was made to make the contents funny. It is nothing like the ""Latin for All Occasions"" series; in that series, there is some humour in the Latin translations of contemporary buzzwords.In fact, some people do speak Latin and attempt to converse in it. This book has minimal grammatical helps of the kind that would enable a user to try to make herself understood in Latin. If it ain't already there, you're out of luck.The best feature of the book is its attempts at coining new words for features of modern life unknown to Cicero. A dictionary or word index would have been helpful to assist the reader in finding them, though."
1,Sucky movie,"This movie sucks more than Monica Lewinsky. In order to make a feature out of it, there are scenes which are repeated during the film. It's like a bad recurring dream."
4,Amaryllis Bulbs,"I was very pleased with the service. The bulbs I ordered arrived in two shipments, and the second contained a package of free bulbs. Although the red and white bulbs have not yet bloomed, they seem to be growing steadily. The price was competitive."
4,No Flashcards,The Preview shows math flashcards in the back of the book. The book I received did not have any. I received the 2005 edition.
4,Clay Cure,"Interesting read...very homeopathic, tells of benefits of clay:) The book informs you how & why. Informs about baths, facials, recipes, etc."
3,The Clay cure,"I got the book, and read it.The reason I purchased is that 17 years ago a woman told me her story, and I wanted to understand. Doctors suspected that she had breast cancer, and somebody that was living the natural cures (transmitted through generations), recommended her to wear some sort of a poultice made of a special (color) clay in the affected area. After 6 months it went away on its own.I think that was not cancer, probably some nodules. Never the less the clay did it's job, even if not eaten. Therefore there are some therapeutic properties that are worth studying and knowing. Aren't there more documented studies done here in the US, that can shed some light?I am not convinced that having a nodule or tissue growth I would start eating clay after reading this book, but it might have some merit."
4,Interesting but little new information is gleened,"A good book for those first being introduced to the use of this precious clay. I would recommend that the author have someone edit the next printing of this book, as the typos and errors, tend to make the reading a bit choppy. Seems more like it is a self-published book. Though the contents are informative, and for this reason, though no new material is gleaned, I give this book a four star. I am an advocate of this natural method of healing."
4,building the tie advance,"This was the first lego I built since childhood, so it brings back a lot of nice childhood memory. When I was building this product, I noticed how well this lego is engineered. The body is built to be rigid and torsionally strong. And the side panels are also well engineered. You have to build the side panel exactly right otherwise the panel well curve and you can't fit it to the craft.However, you if have a kid, who wants to play with this product after it is built, it seems to me that it is very big and heavy for a kid to play with. Also there are some parts that are snapped on to the main body which may be loosely fitted.After it is built, it is fitted on a stand. I find that the front slot that support the stand can easily become loose and come undone as it is not very well reinforced. When you have finally finish the product and display somewhere you will find that it is a big and intimidating object you have got on your hand."
4,"Looks great, but don't expect to play with it.","I built this set in about four hours one afternoon. It looks very impressive sitting on my bookshelf, and is built quite strong. However, don't expect to play with it. It's a collector's item and is not intended to be played with or used as an actual toy. It's really more of a decoration, just like all the other Ultimate Collector Series Lego sets."
5,My son loved this,"My son loved building this. It took a long time to put together and he mixed up come of the grey and the black pieces, but overall he is very proud that he built this. When his friends come over he always shows it off. I would recommend that for kids under 12 to have their parents help."
2,"Very funny, but the story of an irresponsible man","First off, Gershon Winkler is funny, very funny. At times, extremely funny.But the thing is.... This is the story of an irresponsible man.Winkler leaves his wife and young daughter's to find himself.He turns his back on his family, and leaves his wife and daughters to fend for themselves in Brooklyn, while he has a middle age crisis of sorts in Los Angeles.He says that he needs to get away from it all, but ends up remarrying and having another daughter.No matter how funny Winkler may be, it can't detract from his irresponsible nature."
4,Self-help workbook for a recoverer of trauma,"This workbook is very thorough and practical. It covers the stages of trauma recovery clearly. It offers the student a variety of techniques to help one overcome the emotional fall-out from a trauma history. One client who used it, thought it expected too fast a pace for her, and she had to set it aside for a while. Following that minimal setback, I, as her therapist, helped her pace herself as she moved through the ""toolkit"". I wish it were less expensive (Its about $21) because the clients who need it, don't have a lot of discretionary income, on top of their copays for therapy."
5,Glass Onion Keeper,"This is an amazing item! No onion odors when using this, and leftover onion stays very fresh for a long time!"
2,Too small for most onions,"If you intend to use this product, you'll have to buy smaller onions. The majority of the onions that are available at my grocery stores are too large for this product. Notice on the picture how the onion is chopped on the top and the bottom and they still had to put it in sideways to get it to fit? I'm still looking..."
3,pretty,I like it. I only hoped that the base had some sort of sillicone ring to help keep the dome more secure because the sound of glass on glass is like that scratching a chalkboard sound.
2,Not happy with the lid on this one,Diappointed in the lid of this container. Very thin and easily breakable. My old one had a lid that was just as thick of glass as the base was...they just don't make things the way they use to...
5,No odors!,"Like others have said, this is a little on the small side, but I buy small/medium sized onions so for me the size is perfect. I can keep an onion in this and store it in the fridge and take it out once a day to slice off a bit for a sandwich. I was skeptical that this would keep the odor of onion out of my fridge since there really isn't any seal of any kind but I really haven't noticed any smells like you can get when you store onions in baggies. I am thrilled to have found a plastic-free onion storage solution!Plus, ya know...you could use it as a teeny tiny cheese dome. :)"
3,Nice mug,"Mug is cute, that's for sure. Doesn't hold liquid very well at all, though. Be sure you don't tip it while you have hot coffee in it! =("
4,Having not seen the reviews for this book in some time,"I was suprised to see that they have suddenly turned negative! Could it be that someone who was particularly offended by this work decided to post his/her views repeatedly--therby ""flushing"" the reviews that went before?By the way, the writer of this work does NOT misrepresent Papal infallibility. I went through RCIA a couple of years ago and his description is exactly what we were taught."
2,Too thin,"We found that the waffles this product produces were far to thin (1/4"") to our liking no matter how much Backing Powder or Soda Powder we used. Other than that it works like a charm."
2,Poor performance,"Not interested in Belgian waffles, and accepted reputation of manufacturer to purchase ""normal"" waffle maker. Results were terrible (thin) using 3 different recipes (including their own) and returned the unit immediately. Rather than try a second unit, we opted to go to Cuisinart and got exactly what we had in mind."
5,A great waffle maker!,"I purchased 3 of these waffle makers, from Amazon, had been looking for the 'heart shape' for years! Sent one to my girlfriend, who makes waffles almost daily for her large family-hers had just burned out. She loves it-said it is the best one she has ever had, the settings for soft/crisp, beeping when ready and when done are wonderful!I have been happy with mine as well and sent the other one off with my son to college-he loves waffles for breakfast and it is a fast, easy meal for him.I would recommend this one with no reservations! (I ordered these about a year and a half ago and still working well)."
4,Great in almost every respect,"I really have enjoyed this product. It is great in almost every respect. The two problems I have with it are both big and small. I wished that the waffles were bigger and thicken. This is the small problem. The bigger problem is that isn't an on and off switch. The plugging in and unplugging is a pain.Other than that I love this waffle maker. I get a perfect waffle every time. It would be difficult to find a better waffle maker, and I know because I researched this thoroughly."
4,Good Iron,"Would have been happier if the paint job was better done, it is hard to read the writing on it now, smeared off by hot batter. The batter catch area could stand to be larger, and easier to clean. But mostly this does a fine job making waffles, if a bit small. I like the hearts, because I can break them apart for my kids, makes them happy to have hand size food."
4,Makes great waffles,"I recently purchased this waffle maker and have been overall pleased with the results. However, the little plastic covering over the temperature dial does not come off, and when the waffle mixture overflows, it gets caked underneath the plastic. Kind of gross."
1,There could not be worst,"I have not made/nor owned a standard waffle maker for over 30 years, since discovering ""belgian waffles"",I must say we own 5 belgian waffle makers [salton, krups & black/decker] [at home & summer place ], all were purchased for between $10 & $20 and make excellent waffles.Well when I saw the "" CHEFS CHOICE WAFFLE PRO EXPRESS "" being highly recommended on Cooks Country [PBS]I said to myself, self maybe we have been missing out on something, NO this machine made the worst waffles we have ever had,don't think we gave up easily, we used the recommended recipe taken from the Cooks Country program, 2 of the recipes that came with the machine & our favorite recipe from good housekeeping cook book, all were flat, dried out [not crisp on the outside, moist in the middle].well I guess it was a cheap enough lesson [ even tho it cost about as much as the 6 plus machines total we had spent in our 50 plus waffle making years,299elly"
4,"Nice waffle iron, got control, too thin","This waffle iron was bought to replace a very nice one that is no longer made. The design is nice, the controls are nice. The only problem is the waffles are very thin, but we can make two with the same batter that once made one and all is ok."
4,Chefs Choice M840,"Chef's Choice works well. Makes Waffles fast,but a little thin. Recommend use crisp on outside only,otherwise the waffles will be over cooked.Good Price from Amazon."
5,beautiful waffles,I purchased this waffle maker for my husband. He searched out different types and this is the one he selected. Have had great tasting waffles twice now.
2,"Started great, then...",This was a great waffle iron for the first 6 months or so. Subsequently we have been having trouble with waffles sticking and the timer is not working properly.
3,Does the job at least,"I think someone has already mentioned that the white print wipes off quite easily and quickly after the second+ use. Kind of a sloppy touch.I had to re-assemble this surprisingly after I discovered it was misassembled. The clasp that keeps the top cover hinged in place to the bottom piece had to be removed and put back into its slotted place. Another kinda sloppy touch.However, what am I asking for? I am asking for waffles to be made perfectly the first and every time and this thing does that. I will have to somehow write down/remember what the labels are for the switch when the printing eventually wipes clean.Oh and don't get fooled by the non stick surface. It is extremely thin layered and if you mistakenly use a metal utensil to remove a waffle, you will easily scratch off the layer. Use a plastic fork and oil the top and bottom surfaces about every two meals"
5,really works!!!!!!!,"being that my wife is from Norway, we used to use an old cast iron, hand-held waffle iron (with the ""heart"" pattern) for decades - the problem was that the device did not work so well on electric stoves... plus the first set of waffles always came out inedible no matter what you did, it made a mess and was a pain-in-the-neck to clean...this device, however, makes perfect waffles from the get-go... crispy on the outside while a soft on the inside - we have even played around with different batters and they all work well in this device!!!! and they are delicious! moreover, it is sooooo easy to clean - we love this item so much that we bought waffle makers for our children and our niece... they too all love the device...we have had ours for almost 2 years and it is still turning out beautiful, delicious waffles!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,bought threetypes.,"So I retired and splurged. Now when the grandkids come over they can ""Order"" the thickness of waffle they want. This is the thinnest and can be tough if overcooked just a little bit. Thin batter seems to resolve the problem."
4,Love it,"I have used this waffle maker twice, and it is great. It's hard to find a waffle maker that has small pattern grids. It seems built well and it was easy to dial it in to get the desired color and crispness. Also, once you start making waffles you can crank them out very quickly. I hope it lasts."
1,Useless,"I cannot believe people rated this thing with 5 stars. If you want to use an always dirty waffle maker then go ahead. But you will NEVER get this thing clean. When it comes out of the sides it goes into the control button and you will not be able to get it out. It just looks dirty all the time. The waffles have to be REALLY thin in order not to overflow (I am from Germany and we invented this type of waffle maker, so I know what I'm taking about).The front handle came off as well.This thing is just cheap for a high price.I would not recommend it at all."
3,this waffle maker makes fart noises,"This waffle maker make great, albeit small and thin, waffles that are crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. It also makes very squeaky, gassy noises right after you close the lid on the batter. It may be my recipe (Alton Brown's Waffle of Insane Greatness). I have never had a waffle maker that made this sort of noise from the steam escaping. I wish you could also dial down the volume or turn off the beeping noise, my last waffle iron just had a click which was sufficient. I didn't feel like this waffle iron was particularly quick or special. I am happy with this purchase but wouldn't consider it better than my last no-name one."
4,Really like the consistancy,"The waffle works very well, being able to control the crispiness on the outside and moisture of the inside is great, the waffles are done just the way I like them. The only concern I have is that the waffles do not come out quite as fluffy as they did with my old waffle iron, not sure what the difference is but the older one just didn't press down as hard I guess. The quality of the iron is excellent, the non-stick surface is great and cleans up well."
2,Waffles way too thin,"Like many here, I picked this waffle iron based on the great reviews. After using a few times I can say that it works well mechanically, but the waffles are horrible. The waffles come out so very thin that I wouldn't even call them waffles. They are more like crepes or bad pancakes. The iron is good to use - heats up quickly, non-stick, beeps when finished cooking, etc. If it made good waffles I'd keep it. The waffles are limp, with no crispiness to the exterior at all. They are so thin there is no interior to speak of. If you like your waffles that way, then this is the unit for you."
1,TOXIC CHEMICALS???,"No mention of non-stick materials being safe? Too bad you can't choose zero stars! Sorry not feelin the love. The nice little hearts are sweet but the fluoro-chemicals NOT SO MUCH! One must assume toxic fluoride(PFOA) added to every waffle and toxic fluoride fumes(PFTE) shared by everyone in the proximity. Non-stick is great but not at the expense of health! Get with the program. Safe, ecofriendly products are now widely avaialable!"
1,Misleading,"I searched for ""Waffle iron made in the USA"". This item came up on my search results. I ordered it. When it arrived, on the bottom of the box, it reads, ""Engineered in Germany and Made in China."" Why does this come up under a search for ""Made in the USA?"" Needless to say, it's going back to Amazon and they need to upgrade their search engine software. Very misleading!!!!"
4,Fast!,"Out of the box, it feels cheap and flimsy. It does work well. Lots of choices for the finished waffle. They do come off the griddle effortlessly. We still can't figure out how to wrap the cord around the bottom for storage. The bottom of ours is different than the one in the instruction booklet. Stands up to store. Takes up very little space in the cupboard."
4,"Easy to make, easy to clean","Easy to understand directions, easy to operate. All around very good appliance. Opened and made wonderful waffles on Christmas morning."
4,Waffles Soothe Childhood Trauma,"I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas. What to buy? The Boyfriend and I love to cook - so we pondered different kitchen gadgets. I remembered that The Boyfriend mentioned how much he missed waffles. So we chose this waffle iron.Well - UPS delivered it a few hours ago and here we sit, stuffed full of buttermilk waffles. As it turns out, The Boyfriend's mother had ""thrown away our waffle iron when I was 12 or so - and that made me sad."" He then added: ""Then we moved into the house, and YOU threw away that waffle iron we had. I've been missing waffles ever since.""So the two most important women in his life are guilty of kicking waffles out of his life. Now they are back. Thank you Chef's Choice. Within hours of delivery of your fine product - all past waffle iron sins have been forgotten. I think The Boyfriend will be talking about waffles in his sleep.If you want good waffles - buy this waffle iron."
2,Saw on Cook's Country; Dissapointed; Pancake-like Waffles,"After seeing waffle makers reviewed on Cook's Country, and this one called out as the best, I went ahead and ordered it. My family loves waffles but 99% of them come from Eggo. I'm not a big fan of super thick Belgian waffles so I thought this would be a good compromise. Turns out it makes something more akin to a waffle pancake or thick crepe. I could not get them crispy though they would get very dark in color when I turned the dial up to 5. To give you a sense of the finished product, think of something about 30% thinner than an Eggo. I ended up returning mine to Amazon and will try out another make/model.The design, controls, etc were all very good, though the darkness control was oddly loose. Cleanup was indeed a breeze and the unit was nice and compact. So I wouldn't discount all Chef's Choice products but this one simply fell short of my expectations."
3,Quick Waffles,"It was easy to setup and quick to reach the right baking temperature for each set of waffles . I did not like how soft the wafflescame out even when I allowed it to cook longer . I was also surprise to see how thin the waffles were . If you just want to put out a lot of waffles quickly , [to feed the hungry masses , this is fine for this task but if you want thicker and crispier results, use another type waffle maker like Black and Decker's model G48TD .[...]"
2,Since it doesn't come apart it's almost impossible to clean,"For $50 the Chef's Choice M840 Waffle Pro Express Waffle Maker isn't a good deal. My main gripe is it doesn't make a good waffle. Even at the highest color number and texture settings the waffles don't get really golden brown or crisp. And if you make the mistake of putting in to much batter it will over flow and spill out, getting into every nook and cranny, and there's a lot of them. Since it is not designed to take apart cleaning out the over flowed batter is a real nightmare. Whoever gave this waffle iron 4 and a half stars was either insane or on the take."
2,Cooks Waffle Style Pancakes,"My old waffle maker broke and I decided to purchase a new one. I searched around and noticed this one advertised on HGTV as one of Chef's Choice. I read reviews, liked what I saw and purchased it. I really liked what I saw. This machine is real great for storage and has cute heart like designs. I was real excited and made some waffles. I was very disappointed; they were more like cute pancakes. I don't need a machine to cook pancakes; I wanted waffles! At least there is one good thing; its can be stored great without taking up much space. I think I will save it for valentines day. I will be looking for a new one!"
2,Too small and expensive,I was very disappointed to find this was so much smaller than I had expected. I have also seen it in local retail stores for much less money.
2,Way too small!,"I don't understand how Mom of six could have used this waffle iron to feed her kids and have a chance to eat breakfast herself before noon. This waffle iron is TINY! The waffle iron area is about 6"" in diameter. I am returning it before ever using it because it is way too small to feed my family of three! In addition, it has a beeper, which I did not realize. Having just spent five years with a waffle iron that beeps incessantly whether or not the waffles were ready has soured me completely on beeping. Where is a regular old traditional waffle iron?"
5,Molly and Me,"An engaging story of a woman, you would like to be friends with, who finagles a job when there are none. In order to keep it she must outwit her boss and her employer, and help her friends while maintaining dignity, poise, elegance and find a way for the classes to share a changing culture."
4,great movie,This is a great sentimental old movie that features a very young Roddy McDowell. It is classic Monty Woolley as the grumpy rich man who is dissatisfied with everyone around him.
3,A bit too bulky of a jet,"This was a very fun LEGO jet to build, the instructions were very easy to read and follow. Both of my 8 year old sons were able to help with relative ease. The jet looks impressive once it is completed, but there are no landing gear and the method used to attach the wings is not very solid. As the aircraft sits on its stand, the wings sag. There should have been a better method used to construct the wings and the insertion into the fuselage. Overall it was a good project and my kids did enjoy making it."
5,Best Project Ever!,I built this for my Dad because he is a pilot and now it sits on his desk. I'm a good builder but this one was hard and fun.
5,Super,"This is a great toy. My husband and 3 boys had so much fun putting this together. It took them about a week - they had it on the diningroom table, and would work on it a few hours each night. They loved it - it looks great!"
3,Just finished...,"Immediately after I finished building this, it burst into flames. Apparently the batteries were faulty? 5 stars for realism, 0 stars for durability. Womp womp."
4,good buy,fun toy to build. not much play time but i didnt expect it. reasonably priced for what it is
2,"Great, but Lego needs to work on pieces staying together.","My daughter begged me for this item for her birthday and even though it was quite pricey, I acquiesed. She was so excited to put it together and had half of it done when the pieces started falling apart as if the size and weight of the aircraft could not keep the small pieces together. She became very frustrated, attempted to redo the project and once again it fell apart. I have a feeling we are not going to see this project completely assembled. That is not to say that other products LEGO makes are not wonderful, they are, but LEGO and Boeing (Ha-Ha) need to re-engineer this product."
1,Plagiarism?,"Laurence H. Tribe has admitted that he plagiared several passages from Henry J. Abraham's 1974 book on Supreme Court appointments, Justices and Presidents. Research before you buy.."
3,Its OK,Makes the skin feel tight when used properly. I like it. Not sure enough to reorder in the future. Still looking for a great product.
2,copyright 1997 edition of the book is now outdated,Buy the 2004 edition published by Bloomberg Press and don't waste your money on this. The 2004 edition has much more material.
1,not a good buy misleading title,"lots of vague advice on how to estate plan and no case studies with hard facts to back up assertions. examples about the rockefeller's and rothschild's are not very well documented except for the fact that the author suggest that mayer rothschild, the founder of family fortune entrusted his sons to build up banks around the world and doing so created a family fortune on the basis of exchange information within the family. Author fails to expound on the fact on how the families who amassed fortunes did on keeping the respective families fortunes intact withh respect to the descendants. the book is more like rich dad poor dad for estate planning."
1,May be for the super rich,My broker recommended this book as an intro to estate planning. This book seems to be aimed at the super-rich with big families. Not appropriate for me or anyone trying to learn about estate planning
5,Great!,Paul Simon is at the top of his form. This is an inspiredmusical. It is definitely some of Paul Simons best work.The collaborative effort between all the singers is uplifting.The other singers match Simon in feeling.Here is my take on why it didn't make it on Broadway. Cape Manwas not sentimental. But still could have made it with one maindown on one knee love song and theme.Cape man was mising the all out grunt so necessary for the sophisticates of broadway. Then all those New Yorkerswould have had a a tear or two and left happy.
5,A Most Beautiful Loser!,"How could this musical fail? It had a good theme, a wonderful score and the lyrics are so powerful. It's a pity it was misregarded and underrated when it opened, and it also upsets you if you think that other terrible musicals - far below from this work - have even made it for the Tony Award. Paul Simon's talent is at his best in this inspired creation and some of the songs are simply marvelous, like ""Trailway Bus"", one of Simon's finest compositions ever. I highly recommend this album, not only for Paul Simons's admirers but to anyone who considers music and musicals an art form."
1,Awful,"Wow, what happened to Paul Simon? Hard to beleive the artist who gave us the wonderful Graceland and There Goes Rhymin Simon could serve up this terd. No wonder it flopped big time on the stage. Since Graceland, he has been in dramatic and swift decline and he has hit bottom here. Four-letter words, no melodies, I could write this garbage. Avoid at all cost...."
5,What a shocker...,"I'll admit, at first I was skeptical about reading this book, but once I opened it I could not put this page-turner down!I laughed, I cried, I even made a meal while being captivated by this book. I would put this somewhere in between the Bible and Howard Stern's Private Parts.SPOILER ALERT!!!Jaw-dropping conclusion when everyone but the heroine dies in the end and she comforts herself with a bowl of ice cream. Personally, I would have chosen Vanilla - but I'm a dessert snob like that."
3,Not bad,"Interesting, but I was not sure if she was trying to be informative or do lots of name dropping. Also there is name calling and mud slinging. Still, an interesting read for the most part."
4,compelling story,"Having read the book and followed the case, I can attest that there is quite a bit of accuracy in this very recent film about the tragic case of Natalee Holloway. Sure, most of the acting is not so great, but Tracy Pollan is fantastic as Natalee's anguished and unstoppable mother, Beth, who will not give up in her quest to find out what happened to her daughter. The film even includes a reenactment of a recent, possible confession by the main suspect in the case. It works as a bookend.Worth consideration."
2,Sadly disappointed.,Had I been able to actually see the book I wouldn't have purchased it. I would liked to have seen a sample of what the 1890 census sheet actually looked like to relate to the info obtained. I would also liked to have seen a map referring to where the areas were located then compared to now. I feel the book is incomplete.
3,Blood and Sand - The Movie,A love triangle in which an aspiring bullfighter falls under the spell of a beautiful woman.
4,"Lovely tale about love, lust and passion!","OK, Tyrone Power is not a matador! But, he is the a great lover on the screen. He can be the husband for Linda Darnell and the puppet for Miss Hayworth (terrific as Doña Sol). More... the movie is magnificent. Only director Mamoulian can paint on the screen like Velazquez on the canvas!"
3,Blood and Sand,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Never Watched,"This dvd was a gift for a friend of mine and so I can't make a comment about it, Tyrone Power is a good actor and should be a show worth watching"
3,"Rather boring, plodding, predictable movie",I really expected a better movie. It seems to have been very poorly directed. A lot of things that could have been subtle were just thrown together rather slapdash. A lot of good actors going to waste in a not very well told story. Tyrone Power seemed too beefy for the role. Could have been so much better.
4,Blood and Sand,"I enjoyed this film immensely, the story, the photography and the acting were all very good.Well worth the money, thanks"
1,"Do not buy, go to www.peacecorps.gov for the same info!","The book, or CD-ROM, is nothing more than a poorly make copy of the website. It loads badly on the computer and is outdated information. If the government can sue for copyright infringement, I hope they do!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This 2 tape set contains ONLY FOUR EPISODES. I bought it because I was told that the featured set (7-tapes, 21 episodes) was no longer available. This was December 2001. Why is the featured set still being adverstised? Can anyone say ""BAIT & SWITCH""?"
4,Interesting,"An excellent account of life in the islamic world in the pre-war era (pre WWII I need point out) this book might very well come back into fashion given the heightened significance of Afghanistan and Persia in American life. Byron himself is almost a characature of the aristocratic Brit (noble and arrogant at the same time) and this will rub each reader differently. Nevertheless, he offers a compelling and amazingly accurate depiction of life in these parts before the modern life had begun to make its way, haltingly to these parts."
3,James Joyce in Central Asia,"M. Byron wanted to write literature. His book therefore uses travel material with this goal. And indeed, it is interesting 1930's literature. He also worked hard to learn his stuff about Iran and Central Asia. However, an absence of linguistic ability and his numerous western prejudices prevent him to be sympathetic with the characters he meets. An unpleasant impression of his confirming western superiority pervades the book. On the other hand, it contains interesting informations, particularly on ancient architecture of Iran and Central Asia."
5,"One of the greatest travel books, at least.","A wonderful book: some of the best descriptions of architecture in English; comic dialogue; observations on the politics of the countries he travels through - and the sense of a robust, awkward, narrator throughout."
4,Interesting View of an Area Now in the Spotlight,"In the 1930's this part of the world was far, far away from Britain and the United States. Recent events have placed these countries and people in the forefront. In some ways, Byron's experiences are not much different than those of today. Some of his observations seem quite prescient, but really just help give us a clear picture of an area that has seen a lot of history, and is the stage for more of the same today.This is an interesting read, not only for a portrait of the lifestyle in this part of the world, but of the world-view of the pre-war British. Good travel writing often exposes more about the writer than the countries and people visited, and this book is no exception. While they are writers of different backgrounds and attitudes, this book reads a bit like those of Fermor, whose books I highly recommend.Overall, well worth the read."
5,If you have room for only one CD in your collection...,"...then it's not really a collection. Either way, you should get this album!"
5,ancient music sounds great,the sound on this CD is wonderful and is a great CD to own and use for reflective moments...inspirational
4,High Quality for Price,I live on 4 acres in the country with a fence all along the outside of the property. I recently got a dog and wanted a sign to warn people before coming on the property. My biggest concern was to get a sign that was sturdy and would hold up well. I didn't want to buy a sign more than once. I was very pleased with the sign when I got it. The sign was sturdy and a good size. So much better than the plastic ones.
4,A Dictionary of Dates,Phenomenal desk resource at work or home. Just the thing to solve those arcane Trivial Pursuit questions or use in Jeopardy. Another fun thing is to surprise friends with (potentially) unknown factoids about what happened on their birth days in other years.
1,My experience with this cable is bad.,"After reading a lot, I purchased this cable to connect PS/3 and 52XBR4 LCD TV. Some how after some usage the display is distorted and when I replaced a cheap cable which I bought for few cents from amazon worked far batter than cable. Can you believe it ? I did not until I saw the difference."
2,An old tape recorded on a new CD,"This is an old pre-Dolby tape recorded on CD. Hence, you hear all of the hiss that you used to get on your tapes. What a shame, because it is a good performance."
3,Good symphony in very bad sound,"I have many historical recordings and am devoted to recordings by Monteux. The sound on the first two works on this CD are what you would expect from '40s RCA. But the major work is the Sym. #2: Know before you buy that it is unusually distorted and shrill; actually painful to listen to. Monteux does his usual excellent work, but it was not worth it this time. I have not heard any other recordings of this symphony."
1,Deceptive...,"I Bought one of these units to handle an external DVD/R UNIT. It worked just fine the first couple months, and then it suddenly died, only showing the disk but not being able to mount it any longer. No support from a company without further references. Also the construction of the enclosure is definitely cheap plastic, and the assembly is difficult to put together with an easy, nice fit. Often edges are irregular and screw points unnacurate."
2,Golf Balls Recently purchased,I don't feel the ball went as far as other Top Flite balls that I have used in the past
3,"You have skinny legs, Buy this.",I've tried these on but could not zip it all the way up. My calves aren't that fat! If and when I wear these boots it would have to be underneath my pants.
1,Don't Buy From Easy To Grow!,"The Easy To Grow Bulbs company does not provide customer satisfaction.I always buy my wife an amaryllis bulb for Christmas, and have been doing so for almost 25 years. One year I ordered an Amaryllis bulb from ETGB. Weeks later I was still seeing no signs of life. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement. I got a letter back hinting that I was watering it improperly, or that I had not planted it in a timely manner, or that I was just being impatient. One month later the bulb was either dormant or dead, and further requests for a replacement were met with the equivalent of, ""Buzz off, loser.""My wife is an experienced gardener and has never had a failed winter-forced bulb before. Therefore, I recommend that you avoid ordering bulbs from ETGB--becsue they wont' make good if your bulbs are bad."
3,"Good compilation, but NOT DEFINITIVE!!!","This is a very good compilation, yet it is FAR, FAR, FAR from ""definitive."" For example, there have been three previous greatest hits volumes for the group, as well as the ""Collection"" CD from the early '90's, yet none of these have included ""No Matter How High,"" which was a big, big hit for the Oaks. Furthermore, if this were truly a ""definitive"" collection, it would not omit ANY of the hits. Why didn't Universal allow the Oaks a 2-disc ""GOLD"" set, as they have done many other artists? Then they could have included a few of the groups early crossover recordings for Columbia, as well as a few of their later RCA tracks(eg: their wonderful version of ""(You're My) Soul and Inspiration""). Such a collection would have been ""definitive."" THIS ONE IS NOT. It is full of great tracks and performances, but it still misses the mark."
3,not very good,The sound is not very good. I have my kindle turned all the way up and u can barely hear the music.
4,The Oaks from A-Z,"This is a good collection. It is remastered and thats why I bought it. The first 5 songs are okay. I know they want to introduce you to their early country hits. So, for me, business doesnt pick up until ""Elvira"". I liked their crossover music best. There was a country song of theirs from the early 90's, a cover of ""Walking after Midnight"" that I wish were included in this collection. Overall, its a winner. I challenge you to keep still when ""Bobbie Sue"" comes on."
5,Aslan's Triumph A Winner,An excellent adaptation for the final chapters of the Lion the Witch and The Wardrobe. My 5 year old carries the book around because of the beautiful illustrations.
4,"Hard to find and overpriced, but worth tracking down","Most of DeBarges' greatest can be found on The Ultimate Collection, but this album works pretty well on its own, and the bouncy ""Give It Up"" is one of those great shoulda-beens that nobody really paid attention to."
5,Love It!!!!!,"Debarge will always remain one of my favorite groups of all time...........Highlights on this album are Who's Holding Donna Now,Rhythm Of The Night,The Heart Is Not So Smart,Share My World,and You Wear It Well......I remember buying this album on vinyl when it was released and still have it to this day......Make sure you pick up a copy of this album today!!!!!"
1,Not to Par,Book was of no use at all. Would not prove itself as a good reference or as a fist step to an advanced learning level.
3,NICET,Audio Systems Technology Level 3 Book Number 0-7906-1178-3Explaining how to use a calculator or a CAD programm doesn't belong in a book level 3 for an engineer. I do not recommend this book for audio engineers.
5,Good switch with cut out.,Purchased this switch for it's dry running cut-out feature to protect the plastic pumps should they run dry. An electronic one is better and with more features and ease of use (resetting) but at 8 times the price the Square D is a good proposition by comparison Works great and even if it only lasts a few years it will be more than worth the money in savings on buying plastic pump components and the rotary shaft seals that are used in these pump motors.
2,word game,This product has four word games. Three of the games do not work because one row of the game can never be selected by the stylus. The remaining game is fine and nice to play and works because it does not require the use of the affected row. Not really worth the price unless all 4 games work for me.
3,Illuminated W.O.R.D.,Fun word games but doesn't explain how to play them. It can be hard to see the screen at different angles. Also speed is of the essence and the game doesn't always register your choice at first touch. You have to press it a few times to get it to work. I bought this for my grade school aged son and I play with it more.
1,The Word on W.O.R.D.,"The concept behind the W.O.R.D. handheld game is a good one. However, the ""touch screen"" is unresponsive SO FREQUENTLY that you can't enjoy any of the games! I tried the reset button and new batteries, but it still would not work properly. It was not unusual to have to tap a letter 5 or 6 times and the ""SUBMIT"" button wouldn't always be responsive either. At least it wasn't expensive since it ended up in the garbage. Don't waste your money!!"
3,Disappointing,kills batteries and doesn't work properly all the time parts of the screen don't respond at times and sometimes it just freezes in the middle of a game.
5,electronic game,I like to play this game. It is very fun to play the different word games. I think that it would be a good item to travel with however you would have to be careful not to loose the little stick.
2,"Bought it for my grandma, she hates it","My grandma loves word find games, as do I.I got this for her but she does not like it.The battery consumption is great, but this is not practical.It is a lot funner to use paper and pen to play this.The game area (length/width) is smaller than you think.You'll finish the game fast and might get bored a few games."
3,it's okay,"You should know that this game makes a loud noise every time you turn it on, so don't plan on playing in the office! I was advised by the maker's customer service that the only option is to let the game go to ""sleep"" instead of turning it off.Let me just say, the first time I played, I beat the word scramble game!! Maybe I'm smarter than I thought, or this game is just a little easy. I'm going to be optimistic and assume I'm a GENIUS and see how I do against the other games on the device."
2,Illuminated WORD game,"Recently purchased (March 2011) 2 new games. Both worked great at first, then in less then a month they both have cells on the screen that will not highlight when selected. For me it was a waste of money even though I like the game."
1,No good,"I couldn't get it to work for any diagonal words...So for me, it's useless....And I did try many times. Great seller...Bad product. Not sellers fault."
5,You can't stop playing the game,"I bought this for my 14-year old niece and she became addictive to it from the start. She had no problems with the unit itself and found all the 4 games amazing especially the TEXT TUMBLER which according to her, is much more challenging. Overall, I will recommend this product and it's worth the price."
3,Illuminated WORD,"Illuminated WORD is a nice game, but the touch screen does not function well. I have to touch it several times in order to make a play. Also, not all the letters show up well. Sometimes an ""O"" looks like a ""C"", ect... The games are nice, but the overall function is not. It can be frustrating. I would not recommend this product due to functionality."
3,Christmas,"I bought this for a child and he played with it for a day, got bored and went back to the real computer."
1,Not as great as it looks,"I bought this for myself because I love word games and get tired of looking through them on my phone, it's hard to find a good app. I saw this in a store and bought it through here since it was cheaper, and cheap is the key word. Yes this has good games, but the system itself sucks and isn't fun to use. Total waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money--the touchscreen doesn't last,"Got this for Christmas as I love word games. It worked great for about 4-5 times. Went to use it and the touch screen doesn't always work. Then it started working and certain parts of the screen don't respond.Don't waste your time and money on this.I didn't want to give this any stars, but had to to submit. That is how crappy it is!"
4,Fun Travel Game,I love playing word games on my computer and this is perfect for travel. I would definitely recommend this game.
3,Not as expected.,"Not what I was looking for. You have to find the words that the creater wants for you to find in each word search. Also, there is no reward for finding a correct word. You are not sure if it knows that you circled a word or not. Not recommended."
3,Fun,"I really like this game. All four games are fun and challenging. However, I only give it three stars because quite often when I touch the stylus to the screen, the letter won't get selected. I have lost games because it takes too long for a letter to get selected. It's like the screen can't sense the stylus, for some reason. Other than that, when it works right, it is a good hand-held game to have."
1,Doesn't last,"My problem is similar to others I've read here. We love the game, but a few months after purchasing it the ""submit"" button failed to work. We reset it, we put in new batteries, and nothing helped, so basically it's now a piece of junk. I emailed Techno Source THREE times before I finally got a response (I could not find a phone number to call) and was told by Pat that there was nothing that could be done because they only replace items within 90 days of purchase. ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" was all I got. I came here hoping that my experience was a fluke, but I see that it is not, so unfortunately, even though we love this game, we won't be purchasing another, and this one is going in the trash."
3,Nice but could use improvement,"This is a nice game, but I agree that the stylus sometimes does not do what it is supposed to do. For the price, it could use some improvement. Other than that, it is a good handheld game."
1,POS,Touch screen does not work at all. The only thing you can do is turn it on & off. I think they should recall this item & correct it. From the looks of it I am not othe only person that has had problems with this item.
1,So Disappointed,"I bought this game as a Christmas present for my mother. The ""submit"" button didn't work so I did as the manual said and hit reset; no luck. Changed the batteries; no luck. Emailed TechnoSource three (3) times and failed to get ANY response. I finally returned the item to Amazon. As luck would have it I got an email from Pat the next day apologizing for the delay and saying they had shipped a replacement via FedEx. I told him I'd returned the game but he said not to worry about it and to keep the replacement. Good thing I returned the thing because the ""replacement"" went to someplace in Kansas... I'm in Idaho. I won't be purchasing items from TechnoSource again."
5,Classic Comfort Horror,"Now this is what I'm all about. Give me the old Hammer classics ANYtime. This was a great tale of terror from 1964, starring Peter Cushing, and Christpher Lee. A tiny village in turn-of-the-century Bavaria, or Germany, etc,(wasn't it always?)is terrorized by series of murders where all the victims are turned to stone! Back in those days you rarely saw the monster until the end, and I thought this always made the film more suspenseful. I love the backrounds,sets, and lighting in these old 60's British horror flicks. They always give me fond memories of being a kid, watching my favorite Saturday night horror show, under my blanket, with some popcorn, and the lights turned off. Good times, and a great movie! I know there's other stuff that might be better out there, but to me the old greats like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and of course, Vincent Price, will always be dearest to my heart."
2,some of these reviews are so serious about such a silly movie,"Look, this movie is truly a result of the era. The concept today is soooooooo corny.What is notable is that Christopher Lee's silly hair really reminds me of ""Uncle Rico"" from Napoleon Dynamite. I couldn't stop snickering throughout the flick."
3,the un GORG-eous,"good orig. film, one of the best of brit scifi/horror. the vid/audio q is nice, the actor selection and acting good. this film just needed more gorgon action. its good to see pete cush as the bad guy and chris lee as the good guy in this film, the story and continuity was good. the colors-nice along with the pretty good fx."
1,For god's sake! Not realistic at all!,"My god! How much research did these people do? This was probably the most unrealistic film in existence, The Gorgon was quite pretty! Her snakes looked like deli meats and wind up toys! I mean, sure the film in general was good, but the makeup, atrocious! I mean, I am an expert on gorgons, their names were not tasiffany,Medusa,and Maguera, their names were, Medusa meaning ruler, Sthenno meaning strong, and Euryale meaning wide leaping, they had huge tusk-like teeth,their tongues were always sticking out, they had huge bronze wings, and bronze hands with long claws, not scaly faces and green nightgowns, my advice, buy the program called Perseus and the Gorgon, that was a good film."
1,Don't buy this CD,"The jewel case inserts are printed using color inkjet printer. The CD itself is a normal CDR, same as those you burn using a normal CDRW drive, not professionally manufactured. The CD is probably home-made. Worst still, it doesn't play in all computers. I could play it in my wife's computer, but not my own. CDRs are known to have compatibility problems when used in a different computer from the one used to create them.The CD consists of two tracks, one with frog sound, the other supposedly does not. However, I heard frog sound in the second track as well, although it is not as frequent as the first. It is very annoying especially if you listen to it at night while trying to sleep.The recordings are clear, with no static hissing sound. But I am very disappointed that the editorial review does not reveal that it contains frog sound. Also, I wish the CD were professionally made."
5,She weaves a great story,"Certainly enjoyed this thriller of Mariah Stewart. It has everything; mystery, suspense and sex. Looking forward to any and all her upcoming."
1,"Ugh; not mysterious, thrilling, romantic or humurous--annoying and boring read","Ugh. This was the worst in the series by far; it was literally a chore to drag myself through the end. All the stuff about Eddie Kroll is just completely irrelevant and stupid and detracts from what's supposed to be the main story. Nina was also incredibly stupid and annoying, and as other reviewers have mentioned the killer was quite obvious and the resolution a mess. By the time I got to the end I was just finishing it to finish it and was completely unconcerned and uninvolved in what was happening. A terrible read; the first two (Cold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novel) are worth borrowing, but this one isn't even worth that. Lacks suspense, romance, mystery, humor--it doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Borrow the first two in the series, but this one isn't even worth that."
3,"Solid, but not stellar.","This third book in the series isn't my favorite, but it was a pretty good read/listen.Mariah Stewart always does a good job of sucking you in to the story and making you want to stick around until everything is resolved. Being a fan of series books, I love that we get new characters with news stories, but get to visit with old friends. Stewart is excellent at maintaining the ongoing story lines and I really enjoy that aspect of her writing.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a new favorite author. Her series are really quite good!"
5,Great Read!,"If you like suspense, if you like well written characters and if you love exciting twists and turns than this is the book for you. Just make sure that once you start it you've left a nice open block of time to finish it because I promise, you won't be able to put it down!"
1,Cancelled transaction,"This transaction was cancelled because was out of stock, they gave me my money back"
4,A broken spine on the roadway to promise.,"What the goat gives the ram takes. A spasmodic conclusion of decades of rock n' roll barbarism. One last cry from the throat of a dying fig tree. Like finding a brown starfish in your corn flakes and then some, or as the kids in Austin say ""Just Groovy, Needle Man!"""
3,Great for the Dean Martin Fan,"Great vintage country songs for the die-hard Dean Martin fan. Some of the tunes are not that memorable, but a nice listen if you're feeling nostalgic."
5,"Hilarious, Adorable","This book is the best. Absolutely hilarious, reflective and adorable to lovers of our companion animals. Love it!"
2,Out of context,"This is a gift-book that is a compilation of single frames from previously published whole comic strips. The frames are usually the ""punch lines"" and are funny only if you have previously read the entire strip and understand the dysfunction that is Bucky Katt. There is no new material here. If the recipient of the gift is not familiar with the material, they will not think this is funny. If they are familiar with the material, they have seen all of this before."
3,Not what I expected.,"It was witty little snippets from the Get Fuzzy comic strip. It was briefly amusing, but not as engaging as the full comic novellas."
3,Cute Book,The book is a great gift. Was dissapointed that Darby Conley couldn't get this printed in the United States.
3,a bit disappointed,"if i had known the nature of this book, i would have bought another of darby conley's books for myself. ""i would have bought you a cat"" makes a wonderful gift book, i guess, but not for personal reading. i've read other get fuzzy books and found them to be delightful, but this book is not a typical 'comic book'. somewhat dissapointed, but if you're thinking of a unique gift to give someone who has a cat (and you can't come up with any other ideas), this would make a great gift."
2,Great for the Coffee Table,If you like Get Fuzzy you are going to love this book. I laugh everytime I read it.
2,Expensive for this format,Disapointing for a first 'Conley' experience.Might be good if you are the #1 fan...
1,fairly useless book,"was looking for some interesting wisconsin campsites (being from minnesota), but this book had mainly county and state parks. nothing new, i could have gotten all this information from 10 minutes on the wisconsin state parks website. most of the campsites he suggest appear to be suited for families looking for a peaceful weekend, some of them are really close to towns. i bought the colorado and ozark national park book of the same series and found them useful, but this book is a waste."
5,Pedid que ya se os ha dado,"Buenisimo, no importa en que momento tomes el libro te pones de buen humor. y te da ese sentimiento de tranquilidad."
2,Ask and It Is Given,"Some points make a lot of sense but others don't yeah we are the makers of our paths most of the time, and we can improve our lives with knowledge and spirituality. But this is not for ""all"" of us like this book is trying to tell you, there are so many people in our country and other countries that don't have food to eat, or are victims of so many crimes, you can't tell them ""you can do it"" you can have anything your heart desire. Realistic? I don't think so, give us the whole truth, not half of the truth. For some of us who know what Mediums can do in ""real life"" I think this is just one of those ""rich getting richer from people who really need to believe in something to go on"" Real life has all diferent colors, ups and downs, not just peaches and roses."
4,"Dirty, sweaty and rocking.","The fact that Crunt's drummer and occasional vocalist is Russel Simins from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion is enough to raise eyebrows. The all-star line up continues with Kat Bjelland from Babes in Toyland on bass and her then-husband Stuart Gray on guitar and vocals. In short, this band produces quick, raunchy and nasty sounding rock 'n roll songs which immediately captivate the listener with their style, sexiness and immediacy. With their choppy, distorted guitars and frantic drums, Gray and Simins groan and yell about sweat, vengeance, pigs and sex, while Bjelland pounds away at her bass and even lends her trademark screeching yell to ""Unglued"". Both the music and lyrics are raw, blunt and unforgiving, with no pretense or ornamentation. Guaranteed to make your body move and highly recommended to anyone into JSBX or Boss Hog."
3,"Good idea, though needs improvement","I got these gear grips to carry long handled tools, such as axes, rakes, shovels, cant hooks, etc. They seem to work a bit better on larger diameter handles or oddly shaped handles than they do on small round handles.The bases are pretty flimsy, and after just twisting on the clamps the little release button was mushed over and doesn't hold the clamps so well. The grip ratchets have a pretty coarse adjustment, so either things end up too loose or too tight.The bases will mount on large tubes, like the side rails of a Kolpin rear drop rack. They need periodic tightening to keep them from loosening up though."
4,Depends on how you look at it....,"Depends on how you look at it. This is the first OpenBSD specific book (other than building linux and openbsd firewalls, which doesnt count as specific to me) and I was hoping for something more advanced. It can be better described as a general book on openbsd that will hopefully educate the newbie user base. Im very impressed with its presentation and format. Theres little coverage of more advanced topics such as VPNS (i was hoping for IPsec and ISAKMPD info), and I think the book spends a bit too many pages on installation coverage. Other than that its great. After reading through most of it I can say that I have a more structured understanding of openbsd than I did before. I think this book is good for newbies and those of moderate to slightly advanced skill. Im glad that I got the book, ......"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is the worst networking product I have ever used. When used IN THE SAME ROOM with a wireless router, it continually dropped down to a 1 megabit speed. It never performed anywhere near 54meg. Nearby, my other systems with Intel and Linksys adapters were consistently connecting at 54 meg and performing very well.The product is a dog! Don't waste your time. Consider almost any other adapter. I returned mine to Best Buy where it was purchased at an inflated price. (Didn't have time to order from Amazon.)"
1,JUNK.....DO NOT BUY,"This adapter did nothing but make my windows xp system run like crap. BSOD, registry problems, computer froze repeatedly. And yes I did install the drivers correctly. Once this card was installed it acted virus like. I couldn't even load any google sites, though every other site was fine. Once the card was removed and replaced with a simular product from another manufacturer my computer ran fine. DO NOT BUY>>>PIECE OF CRAP."
1,WPN 311 - Beware!!!,"I'd give it zero stars if I could.This card will definitelly crash to a blue screen intermittently. Windows XP doesn't like this card at all.The 'fix' from Netgear trashed my registry. The hardware caused a total trashing of my primary hard drive (MBR), probably due to poor circut design.This has happened not once, but TWICE on two different computers!Buying this card is asking for major trouble and paying for the privilege.I would recommend running CAT 5 cable instead.STAY AWAY FROM THIS POS!"
1,This card stinks,"I bought two of these cards, along with the Netgear 824 wireless router. Stuck the cards in separate Win XP boxes, and immediately started having system freezes and blues screens of death on BOTH boxes. I will never buy Netgear stuff again. Prior to this I was running Linksys 802.11b, and I really regret not sticking with Linksys."
1,Not compatible with AMD processors,"Hi,I just got off the phone to Netgear tech support.They informed me that the wireless card was slowing my PC down and dropping out because...It doesn't work with some AMD processors!!!!The tech guy told me to give the card back to the shop and buy something made by another manufacturer!I guess this explains why some people on amazon didn't have problems, while others have been tearing their hair out.What annoys me about this is that Netgear do not state that this product is only compatible with Intel processors anywhere on their website. I guess that leaving angry customers to figure it out for themselves is what they consider to be a professional way of doing business.I won't be doing business with Netgear ever again. There are plenty of other companies out there with a better attitude to sales.When googling ""AMD Netgear problems"" it turns out that the WPN311 isn't the only card with problems.Joel Green"
2,Don't spend the money on it,"Followed the instructions to the letter and will connect sporadically. Wanted this card to take advantage of my RangeMax Router.The card works, but the sofware is horrible. Should have went with a cheaper card."
1,Nothing but trouble.,"Pros:1. There are not any.Cons:1. It is very expensive.2. It took five installations before it installed. In addition, it took another two hours with two Netgear technicians from India to get it working.3. It does not work if you have a software firewall installed."
4,Must see precurser to wide-angle lensed horrer!,"This film broke all the rules back in '79 --an African man raising a white kid, retalitory strikes against child abuse, kids as killers, surreal nightmares,and more. I saw it back then and remember the audience impact it had. Long before Scorcese and the like, the director was pioneering new forms of filmaking (most of the film was actually shot in 1968!). This is worth alook for anyone seriously interested in the history of the genre. Terrific"
1,Truly awful,"This is absolutely terrible.It comes very low on the scare factor and the effects are the cheesiest I""ve ever seen.The acting is god-awful and the script horrendous.Avoid this at all costs and don""t invest any type of money,not even a penny in renting or buying this video whatsoever!"
2,Want to buy a copy and am willing to pay 30 dollars for 1,"I know this movie was weird and very low in Quality to the Other Friday 13th movie, however there was a few parts I liked in it and anyone have one Im willing to pay up to 30 dollars for a copy or around that write to Kevin at inkev61@aol.com"
1,A poor excuse for a Friday The 13th movie,Friday The 13th:The Orphan is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's a poor excuse for a Friday The 13th movie and the only reason it's got Friday The 13th in the title is because the producers of The Orphan wanted to take advantage of the popularity of Friday The 13th and all it's sequals. Rated D for Dumb.
5,Can't get enough,"I love this stuff: we use it on our kitchen cabinets (which we purchased unfinished) and it brings out the color and warmth of the wood. We also use it on our chopping board.Non toxic, ""green"" and it smells great.10/10"
2,Just buy mineral oil,"After using just mineral oil on my butcher-block island, I decided to try this, having heard the virtues of beeswax. Leaves a residue that makes me feel uncomfortable to leave things on the island for too long. Maybe I'll try pure beeswax sometime. But in the meantime, this wasn't really an improvement over a $2 bottle of mineral oil from the drugstore."
2,"Messy application, not as smooth as other furniture waxes","We needed to polish our dining room table so I bought this cream since it's the only available on Amazon. The application was much messier than waxes I have used in the past on our table, and the directions indicate you have to leave the wax on the table for several hours before buffing, which was a little inconvenient. The cream doesn't really shine, so it didn't work well in terms of polishing a finished surface. Also, the directions indicate to polish with your bare hands, which I didn't really want to do, so perhaps that explains my mixed results."

2,It Just Went On and On.....,"I was hoping for a fun and charming ""mystery-romance"" book for the beach. But, this was not it. It just went on and on....and, I didn't think it would ever end. So, I skipped to the back, found out who it was and just ended it. It's way too long, and just not exciting enough. I couldn't care less who the culprit was or who was going to get killed....that's a bad sign in a mystery book. Not worth it."
2,Love boat chapter 5865,"If you saw on TV The Love Boat, you already read this book no matter what chapter you saw, but if you still want to read this book let me tell you that the first 150 pages (more or less) are really boring, I really don't know why I finished the book, but after those pages is going better and better, but it still is a chapter of The Love Boat."
2,Carried on too long,Will the story never end? Dragging out the suspense didn't make this any better.
1,"""Love Boat"" meets "" Murder She Wrote"" in print.","Please....give me a break. Based on the other Amazon reviews I read, I expected an edge of the seat thriller with lots of laughs. Instead I found this book, boring, predictable and utterly forgettable. If it hadn't been chosen for my book club's selection for the month I never would have even finished it. I can't even compare it to anything else I have ever read. It truly reminds me of reading a really bad script for a TV sitcom. This probably won't even get printed....feel free to edit my comments if it might save some other poor , unsuspecting readers from the torture of reading this book."
2,Heller's Weakest Mystery-Romance at Sea,"Heller has always been a 4 star comedic read for me. I can always count on her for a good evening's entertainment. This is the one time she failed me. Even then I can't say that this is badly written or that I couldn't finish it. I made it through without any big problem but I was disappointed when done. There hadn't been much LOL either. Essentially this is a tale about 3 women friends, all divorcees or about-to-be, who take a cruise together only to discover that one of them is the target for a hit-man by an ex-spouse who wants to get rid of her and his obligations to her. The lead woman meets a man onboard, who she starts having a shipboard romance with, only to ultimately wonder if he is the hit-man. Yes, it is a pretty lame idea, especially for Heller. Well, everyone has a miss and this was hers."
1,The yellow box is worthless.,"All a water level is, is a clear plastic tube with something to close off the air at both ends - you have to remove them to get the level but it keeps the water from leaking out of the tube, or air bubbles from getting in, when you're shlepping it around).Zircon added a totally unnecessary idiot box (light & buzzer) to ""help"" you find the level and thereby jack up the cost of this gizmo. I couldn't get it to work with the yellow box, eventually got frustrated and removed it. The tubing by itself (and water once you get the bubbles out of it) worked great thereafter. Bottom line: do not waste your $24 on this thing. Go down to Home Depot, buy 20' of 3/8"" clear vinyl tubing, clamp off the ends with a couple of those black springy binder clips from your office, and add a little food coloring to the water to make it more visible. Five bucks tops if you steal the clips from work."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I bought this because it advertised on the packaging that one person could use it (generally not the case for waterlevels). The problem with this one is that it seemed virtually impossible to get anything level. The above/below sounds is too similar and the unit doesn't seem to ever give you more than a split second indication of level after which it starts making other noises. Hence the reason for buying -one man job- did not work out. Returned the unit the same day, back to the old tubing for me. An additional problem with this unit is that it's high pitched beeping is REALLY loud in a confined space."
2,Difficult to Use,"Bought this product for a major job that required level posts. It was very difficult to use and get an accurate measurement. It might have been me, but my hopes for this items were not met. In its place, I would have preferred to get just a simple two-tubes and a hose set-up. It was not expensive, so if you're handy and more patient than I am, give it a try."
1,pure propaganda,"The author treats the media as if it is the devil. as if all tv, computers, etc are bad. This book wil surely destroy some child's life"
4,Nice concept but edits ruin the party!,"I was impressed when Motown sold BOTH 'All This Love' & 'Love Me In A Special Way' on a single CD back in 1986. This CD is now out of print, and extremely rare, loaded with hits & other classic jams, BUT Motown felt the need to include short edits of 'Stop! Don't Tease Me' & 'All This Love' instead of the longer album versions. Like most compilations, I had to sell my original copy, and remaster this CD to include the full legnth versions. Peace, SD(from 'Chaka's World')"
5,Roky Rules,"Roky rocks. This is among the finest things he's ever recorded, and that includes his incredible stuff in the 13th Floor Elevators. A bit miraculous, all things considered."
3,Great - but not for headphones!,"The sound quality on these is just plain awful. BUT if you listen on little speakers, with the volume turned low, you'll never notice. I listened to them like that at work for about a week and was happy -- then I tried to listen to them on headphones. Yuck. But because it sounds great at work, I give it 3 stars."
4,good compilation,This is a good compilation of fights from 2009. If you like the UFC. this is a must have for your collection.
2,very weak release by Zuffa,"I may be a bit biased since I own every UFC event on dvd dating back to UFC 66 so I've seen all the fights time and time again.I feel what hurts these releases the most is the fact they are shown on spike for FREE on Unleashed,it really does nothing for me to watch the same fights again,the only original content is the commentary Mike Goldberg provides and never before seen pre-fight/post-fight interviews..overall,it's a poor release with very little reward,I'd avoid buying this."
1,Save your money and time.,"Very few quality fights on this DVD, don't waste your time or money on this DVD. I liked the best of 2008 and 2007 UFC. But they really cut back on championship fights and quality of fights. This is my first time righting opinion on any product on amazon.com but I felt so mad for wasting My money on this product I had do something."
4,Fun & Creative,"As with her other 2 books, this one is a hit. Easy to follow patterns with fun & quick results! A fun book to have. I wish I would have bought it sooner!"
3,not for the advanced knitter,"I found this book disappointing. The first 54 pages were learning how to knit and do the embroidery. Most of the designs are rather simple hats with cute decorations added. 3 basic hats using dk, worsted and heavy worsted yarns. Good purchase if you think the hats are cute although I didn't care for most of them. I like the spiral binding and the babies are quite cute."
5,A Great Addition to your Knitting Library,"I don't care if you have babies in your life or not -- after you see these adorable patterns, you'll be knitting these hats for your dogs, cats, and babies you see on the street! The hats are whimsical, fun, and unexpected -- and totally cute. LOVE IT."
1,The ugliest hats I've ever seen for a baby's head!,"There are maybe 2 cute hats in this entire book, and that's including the hat on the front cover of this book. These are the ugliest hats I've ever seen with crazy color combinations, oversized flowers and bunches of colorful worm looking I- Cords on top of these hats. Looks more like a clown show, nothing cute about it!"
4,"Easy, fun, quick baby-knitting projects","Easy-to-use, complete & clear directions, cute & original designs. I use this book to make baby caps for ""Newborns in Need"" because they go quickly, but still allow me to make some different and creative head-wear for these itty-bitty girls and guys. Photos are great. These are very, very simple -- a good thing for some purposes, potentially a minor disappointment for others."
4,So fun!,I got this book as a present and have knit 5 of the hats so far. I think it is fun and all the patterns are doable if you have a working knowledge of knitting.
2,What a disappointment!,"I expected a number of different baby hats. All I got was the same pattern over and over, with the only difference being the ""decorations"" that had to be created and attached to the hat!"
5,Easy and adorable!!,"I absolutely love this book! The patterns are so easy and so creative! It is so refreshing to see so many adorable, creative patterns in one book. Many times knitting books have one or two good patterns and the rest are so-so. In this book, every single pattern is easy, creative and fun. I have already given two of the hats to a new niece and nephew. The moms loved the gift and have told me about all the compliments that they are getting. The photos are wonderful. I love the fact that each hat has its own little unique fun thing about the pattern. This is a great holiday present for any knitter on your list!!!!!"
5,So Many Amazing Hats!,"Fantastic in every way--this book is a must have for all knitters. Itty-Bitty Hats is bursting with creative ideas. Not only is it presented in an easy to follow manner, the text is entertaining and inspirational as well. So many ideas for so many many different hats of different shapes, colors, and styles. The only problem you might have is deciding which hat to make first--they are all darling beyond words. It is always a blessing when authors as talented as Susan share her ideas with the world."
3,"Better than some, not as good as others...","This soundtrack, composed for a 1987 TV movie, is a very dark and moody affair that perfectly mirrors the film that it complements. It's not a great soundtrack, nor is it inferior, hence, 3 stars.Most TD soundtracks can stand apart from the films they were written for and are still enjoyable listening experiences in and of themselves. This one, not so much. However, it does fit the film like a hand in a glove.Tangerine Dream has done MUCH better soundtracks (i.e. Thief, Miracle Mile, Near Dark) but they have done much worse also (Catch Me If You Can, Heartbreakers).This will probably hold your interest if you are a fan of the movie or a devoted fan of the band."
4,Soundscapes From The Shadows,"The 1980s was a period of an incredible amount of soundtrack work for TD, with albums being released in conjunction with the movie or issued later, which was the case for this 1992 album with material for a 1987 TV movie.The soundscapes lurk in the shadows and deliver a canvas of mostly darker colors; the work is clearly in conjunction with the movie and not concepts that were gathering dust in the corner of the studio, cleaned up and made to ""fit"" into a project.Edgar Froese led the artistic charge into tackling a wealth of these projects - while maintaining a busy touring and recording schedule for TD's own albums - and this soundtrack is highly interesting in scope, yet sombre in vision."
3,Not that deadly after all...,"Well, this album is a bit hard to review. I get the impression that this is a mix of a TD soundtrack and/or someone else working with them on this particular score. Well, offcourse the TD sound is there but at times I still get the feeling that this could be any soundtrack by any electronic musician out there. But don't get me wrong here, this is not a bad album. In fact there are quite a few tracks which are quite good, but that is not enough to make this one worthy enough to buy.But to name a few good tracks on this album comes ""The Hospital"", ""Deadly Care Main Title"", ""More Pills"" and ""Wasted and Sick"". The rest of the songs are not really worth listening to IMO.So, if you want a complete TD collection then buy this one, otherwise don't! But still as I said before, there are a few tracks that holds this album up, and makes it not that deadly after all. If you should buy it? You decide. Listen to samples first!"
3,aint nothin' but a g thang,"When I bought this DVD I thought it would be like another Up in smoke, but on first five mins of waching you know it's compleatly different. This has no glamor and no glitz. If you look closely you can see steem coming out of the perfomers mouth's which meens there wasn't any heating. another thing (this made the DVD worse) was that you couldn't here much of what the rappers were saying (mostly naughty by nature and Mack 1-0) but despite this it just showed that the concert wasn't over done, it just gave the people music not a movie. the highligts were definitly Da Brat and Kurtis Blow who put on a great show"
1,breaking off,camera work sucked bad songs thought that with the lineup they had it would be better but it was real real real real bad
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD........Most of the performances listed isn't even shown on here.....just buy the CD
1,Simply Natural,"From, a technical view point, this DVD has got a room for improvement, contextually - OK: singing is real and emotions are natural.Good in-site of show-industry without a high technology make-up."
5,A well-rounded education in current web development tools,"Platinum Edition XHTML, XML & Java 2 is separated into several sections, each of which focuses on a specific technology, including: XHTML, XML, JavaScript, Dynamic HTML, CGI programming with Perl, Server-side Programming with ASP, ColdFusion & PHP, and Java 2. Throughout the book, the authors focus on the features & benefits of each technology, giving readers a well-rounded education in current web development tools & techniques. In addition, the authors demonstrate the value of combining various technologies (such as Java & XML) for more powerful web solutions. User Level: Intermediate - Advanced,"
2,"If you are a beginner, this book is ok","Not as comprehensive as I thought. The only best thing of this book is that it talks about almost all the web languages, give you the basic understanding."
3,"They ""out weirded"" themselves on this one","The vocals on this effort in my opinion just plain stink in most songs. They adopted a bored, detached, monotone singing style on many songs. The great guitar playing is still there, but it's almost like they put out a ""joke"" album where they're just not trying. I think Love Spoken Here is fantastic, but this just falls short. The weirdness in my opinion overshadows the music. Quite a shame."
4,Fun CD,"We love this CD we bought. We started listening to it when my first son was only days old and he got so used to it that when he was stressed, we would play it and it would calm him down."
1,The Quintessential PIC Microcontroller,"It would be difficult to elaborate all the issues with the book, however the one that caused the most frustration is the use of what could be described as a cross between descriptions expressed in something like biblical or Shakespearian English. This author needs to consider using the English of the day and not words like ""...whilst..."" . The author also tends to ramble about things that just don't apply to the subject. After going through this book I feel as though I have been lectured, not instructed. It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone who's intent is to truly understand the subject matter."
1,useless device,"It won't form all the characters of the alphabet, it's basic presumed purpose for existence."
4,Two masters play Beethoven,"I had this recording back in the 50s when it first came out. It's a great pity they never recorded all the Beethoven sonatas (at least that I know of) because the sense of ensemble musicianship is here at its highest. You have the aged Rubinstein teaming up with the (then) fairly young Henryk Szerying, surely one of the great violinists of his time (listen to that sense of pitch!) on some of the greatest violin-piano music ever written. This is a partnership of equals which exhibits the ""balanced passion"" that is apparently the hallmark of a bygone era, a kind of golden age between the sentimentalizing early years of the 20th century and the grandstanding virtuosity of the 21st (are we there yet?). If you're looking for the ""real"" Beethoven of these sonatas look no further."
1,Disappointed,I have to admit I'm not very convinced of the Rapture as product of Biblical eschatology and I purchased this book based on another book I read by the authors. I enjoyed the other book and thought this one would be as pleasing having greater depth of cited proof and width of cultural exposure. I am said to say that I did not find it convincing and this book showed a lack of credence in the argument it presented with little if any citation from verses within the Bible. I expected better from the author based on other material.
5,Great colors for scrapping/journalling,"These are fabulous pens for scrapbooking and journalling. The colors match perfectly with both the distressed/vintage look as well as the clean, simple look in paper art, and look both at home on colored cardstock or linen colored journal pages. The two points (fine and ultra fine) are perfect for all sorts of art applications.I just received a set from amazon and they were fresh and vibrant.My favorite sharpies yet! I hope they include these colors in their next big set of ultra thin tips!"
3,"Great idea, modest execution.","A linguistic perspective on legal language is a valuable contribution to the study of language and the law. Mr. Solan, with degrees in linguistics and law, is the right author to tackle the subject. And the book has its strong aspects, such as when Solan discusses the details of real cases and shows how judges interpreted language inconsistently, or badly, or in the only way they could. Plus, his insights into the nonlinguistic forces that act on judges are useful.But the book could have used a strong edit. There are too many convoluted sentences; I found myself re-reading for comprehension too often. I found a bit too much abstraction, too. And the constant foreshadowing in the early chapters (""as I'll discuss in chapter 5 . . ."") became very annoying.If the essence of great nonfiction is making complex material understandable, then this book is average."
2,"Barely flies, doesn't glow in the dark","Was looking for a solid glow in the dark Frisbee to use with my dog at night, figured I'd give this one a shot and wish I hadn't. It doesn't glow in the dark whatsoever...and due to the design, it hardly flies. My dog was able to chew holes in it within 5 minutes, which only hinders it's flight more. If you're reading this review and are in the same situation I was, I suggest looking for an LED Frisbee made by an actual sporting goods company instead of a dog toy company. I went that route and am much happier."
1,Horrible Audio,This camera makes the worst video sound recordings I have ever heard. Scratchy and distorted. Worse than recordings by $5.00 recorders on $0.25 cassette tapes. I am returning mine today.
3,Not good for the professional,"The image has so much noise. When one see the full size of the picture you fill the picture is like full of noise, so dirty. and the image size cannot be reduced too, just only mega pixel can be reduced, not the image size."
1,What good is an excellent dead camera?,"I bought one of these Kodak's the other day because I have owned three Kodak digital cameras and I like the Kodak interface. The fact is that this camera takes excellent pictures, but it eats batteries so fast (so UNBELIEVABLY fast) that I have to give it one star. I am using AA rechargeables and I am lucky if the batteries last two days or over 20 pictures. It really is that bad. Forget about movie mode or using the LCD screen. I've never had a camera die on me so many times, and I've only had this camera about two weeks."
3,Laughs at AA's,"This is a good digital camera for people who just want to take snapshots, or are a bit more serious. I bought mine for my college photography class and it did the trick.Pros: Takes nice pictures, surprising video quality,Ability to manual adjust shutter speed and aperture size.Cons: No manual focus ability which is kind of a drag. Biggest problem is battery life.No doubt about it this camera is a gas guzzler. It can use AA batteries or lithium cells. Mine came with a non-rechargeable lithium cell which makes no sense why you'd even make non-rechargeable ones. That lasted about 3 or 4 days with above normal use and leaving the cell in while the camera was off. After that I started using rechargeable Kodak NiMH AA'sIt would eat through those in about an hour or less or constant use. Then I'd have to leave em in the charger for 4 hours or so and start all over again."
4,Incredible camera- Excellent quality with this price,"I have just bought this camera. It's incredible. The pictures very clear and good quality. Light weight and smaller than other SLR like cameras. I like every things of this camera except the LCD screen. In evening, the image viewed through LCD has un-wanted ""noise"", but when the picture was taken then the ""noise"" was gone. Anyway, this camera is worth to buy."
4,S U P E R,"I'm really loving this camera. I can hold it with one hand, zoom in on someone across the room and get a fantastic photo. It's a winner. Sarah Lowell"
1,Lens breaks easily,"This is a really nice camera - if it lasts a year. Six months after buying it, the lens froze. Since we could not find the original receipt, we would have to pay $125 to have it repaired, even though we sent in the registration card when we originally bought it. This is the 2nd Kodak Easyshare camera that we owned that this happened to when the camera was fairly new. The man at the store where we purchased the camera said this is a common problem with Kodak cameras; so my advice would be to NOT purchase any Kodak camera."
2,Eats batteries!,"Pictures can be great -- but this camera EATS BATTERIES. I've taken several thousand photos with it over the past year, and it consumes batteries! You must factor battery usage into the overall cost of ownership for this camera. Don't ever leave home without a spare set. (I've also tried rechargable AA energizers -- but get less than 20 photos per charged set.)"
2,Inconsistent Performance!,"Performance is inconsistent. Pictures taken several seconds (shutter lag is also an issue) apart look drastically different. Auto-focus is hit and miss and sometimes won't lock when zoom is fully extended.After 6 months of use, I would give this camera a C- rating."
1,Invest in extra batteries!,We have been through about 4 pairs of batteries in the first three weeks of owning this camera. Hopefully we figure this out before we have spent much more $ for batteries.
2,DEAD WHEN COOL,"I bought the camera from Amazon in Oct 2007, and have taken about 5,000 photos. It worked well for a while, but uses batteries with relish. Now, when cold, [about 40-50 degrees] it refuses to turn on or stay on, even with new batteries. I went to the Kodak support site, and entered my problem [camera does not turn on]. I was told it would cost $100 to repair plus shipping and taxes. 100 bucks to repair a 200 dollar camera is crazy. I now will buy the Panasonic of my dreams. By-by Kodak!!"
3,Could Be Better,"It would be a great camera if every feature worked. It won't take video, which is not why I bought it, but don't tell me about it if it won't actually work. It tends to ""lock up"" quite frequently and the only way to ""unlock"" it is to open the battery cover and ""reboot"" so to speak. I have lost several non-repeatable shots because of this. I shouldn't have to ship it back to correct the problem which I feel is an unnecessary hassle."
4,Great Camera,"Many people have complained about the camera...most particularly battery life. I bought these batteries Energizer - e AA Lithium Battery and used one pair for a week in the mountains in Switzerland (extreme temperatures) with absolutely NO PROBLEMS!Great pictures!Great Zoom...made a friend with a Canon SLR jealous of the quality of picture I was taking. It's not an slr, but it sure takes a good picture!"
5,Great Camera,"This is a great camera. The pictures are clear and sharp, features are easy to use. This is my second digital camera, I did NOT like my first one, but decided to try one more and I am so glad I did. Recommend this camera to anyone wanting a camera that has zoom, large viewing area, and easy to use extras."
4,Great transaction!,"Very pleased with cameera and shipping and everything. Only issue i have is it keeps resetting Date/Time after i've set it and saved it. When i turn it back on it asks to reset date/time. Otherwise, great deal! Same exact camera in stores now for $100 more than what i got it for! Awesome deal!"
1,If you want blurry pictures this camera is for you,"I bought this camera the first month it was out and I hate it. The picture quality is very bad. Just about all the pictures come out blurry even with a tripod. I contacted kodak to posibly return the item and was told they would not take it back. This product does not perform as promised the 5mp kodak easy share I bought 4 years ago takes better pictures, and it cost $175.00 less."
4,"Easy camera, lousy batteries","There are a lot of other reviews that will talk about the technical specifications of this camera. I read them all and bought my camera on Amazon. (I used MyPoints.com and earned $150 in Amazon gift certificates.) The camera works great and I had a lot of fun taking pictures with it. In fact, I liked it so much that I wore out the battery in about 2 or 3 weeks.I tried using AA and AA rechargeables, but they don't give the camera enough power. So I'm stuck buying a $10 battery...and haven't yet found a decent rechargeable one that'll work for this camera. Just know ahead of time that while it says it can take AA, they don't give the camera enough juice to turn on."
4,Good basic camera,"This is a good basic camera, with better options and resolution than most point-and-shoots. If you're looking for easy-to-control manual settings, you should be looking at an SLR. If your looking for better-than-average photo capability, this is your camera. I find it to be very light for it's size, easy to hold, and easy to take pictures. The menus are fairly self-explanitory. The ""manual"" settings are not intuitive, and changing them is not really fast or easy, but they are there. For me, it's a cheap alternative to an SLR that I don't have spend all my time worrying about."
1,Kodak Customer Service is Awful!,"I bought this camera 10 months ago. Although it was fairly easy to use and took great shots it keeps breaking down. After contacting someone at Kodak they had me pay for shipping to send it to Precision Camera Repair who decides whether or not it is under warranty. I included that I had to pay for shipping because everything else Ive had to send in for repairs the company paid for the shipping. After mailing the camera it somehow takes weeks for them to get it. Then each time they decide its not under warranty and will cost me in the vicinity of $140.00 for repairs....PLUS Shipping. I will NEVER buy another Kodak product I dont care how good of pictures they take... this product is obviously poorly made and if the company is not willing to back it up...Im surely not going to. By the way, the Fuji I bought several years ago and gave to my kids may not look pretty however it still works."
5,You will not be disappointed.,"After seeing that this camera was not immediately available on Amazon, I went to Staples and bought it. It was one of only two available, and I am lucky to have found it. So far, I have been extremely impressed. It takes excellent pictures in a variety of scenarios, but I have been most impressed with its ability in low light situations. Standing in a completely dark room, it makes photos look like it is daylight. The zoom is fantastic. Although the camera is completely automatic and adjusts to the appropriate settings, it allows the flexibility of a manual camera, which is perfect for the amateur photographer who wants a little more out of his or her camera. If you are looking for a simple point and shoot, it might be a little big and complicated, but if you want more, this camera is perfect for you. I don't think you will be disappointed; I know I love it."
5,Nice Camera,"I was reluctant to replace my Canon Rebel G with a digital camera that was not an electronic version of the SLR. But I bought the Kodak 712 IS when a good sale came up, and I have never turned back. The 12X optical zoom has a greater range for both close up and distance shots than my 35-80 lens did on the Canon, the pictures are exceptionally clear, the display is large. I can't say enough about it. It has all the same settings that the Canon did, and so far, the pictures are just as good. Just make sure that you if you take a lot of pictures in low light conditions that you have a back up battery as there is no low battery indicator."
2,Not a good battery life,"I bought this camera a while ago, at first I was very happy. After owning this camera for a little while I wish I had never bought it. The camera sucks through batteries like nothing. It can be very frusturating missing all those pics. If you didn't have to buy batteries every other day I would recomm this camera. I know someone else who bought this same camera and returned it due to the battery life."
1,Don't buy Kodak!!,"I bought this camera. It died on its first outing, after 30 pictures. It would not power-on. I sent it in for repair and they claim that it had ""physical damage"" and I would have to pay $100 plus shipping to get it fixed or they would give me a 15% coupon to the Kodak on-line store. I'm not aware of any physical damage this encountered, but there was nothing I could do. Kodak does not have their own repair center or customer service people, they use service centers for both. All I learned from this is that Kodak is no longer a REAL company and their products should be avoided at ALL costs!!!"
2,Buyer Beware,"My husband purchased this camera for me for my birthday in May. I had only had it 4 months when the lens froze up on me. It had to be serviced and was found to have had an ""interface"" problem with the lens. When I received it back it was less than a month before it ""froze"" up on me again. This time I was able to take the battery out and put it back in and it went back to ""normal"". I took this issue up with the retailer where it was purchased and with a letter to Kodak and neither could replace the defective camera. While it is user friendly, I am very dissapointed in Kodak for the way they handled my situation. This camera should have held up better and for longer than 4 months before needing service. I had a Kodak prior to this one, but doubt I will purchase another because of the service and product quality of the camera. My advice to anyone purchasing this camera is to do your homework and purchase some kind of extended warranty so you do not end up like me."
3,A nice camera but where's the charger?,"I bought this for my wife because I got the same model a couple-3 years earlier. They made a few improvments to it, suck as how you can zoom in on things after you start videoing. I couldn't do that on my camera. Had to zoom before I started the video. But I was extremely disappointed in the fact that there was no battery charger included with the camera. We had to hunt down and buy a seperate set. That got the camera 3 stars."
3,Have to send back defective,I have used several Kodak Easyshare cameras over the years and know several people that have and love this camera. I do believe I received a defective camera and the seller has agreed to let me return it for a refund. I also do not think this reflects on the camera itself.
5,Kodak EasyShare Z712 IS,This is my second purchase of this product - the first being accidentally damaged beyond repair - which well demonstrates my fondness - all around - for this camera.
5,Great camera,"I bought this for my work and pleasure. I love this camera, it has a very good zoom. Have had allot of fun with my grandkids."
5,DIGITAL CAMERA,"Really nice camera. I also got the docking station. Wife loves it.Easy to operate, 12X zoom, nice size view screen. Some nifty bells and whistles. Got it on sale. No complaints."
4,Kodak Easyshare Z712 IS,"This camera is an upgrade purchase from a DX 6490. I like the added features. It makes the camera much more ""user friendly."" The only problem I still have with these cameras is the ""lag"" time that you get when taking a photo. What you see on the screen when you take a picture is not what you get when the camera finally snaps the shot. I have a two-year-old, and he doesn't stay still long enough for those quality photo moments. I haven't tried outdoor shots yet, so maybe these will be better, since a flash is not usually needed. Overall, a nice camera for the price!"
4,The U.K. does the Bronx,"In a move that is by now well-precedented, Sequel enlisted some of the UK's most innovative club/remix producers to overhaul the Sugarhill Records catalog. They couldn't merely update the tracks by giving them contemporary rhythms and production, because the originals continue to be mined for their nascent funk.So, happily, they went at the remixes with more hubris, radically upsetting the architecture of the originals. On this count, the first disc has a slight edge with epic mixes of ""Pump Me Up"" and ""Wheels of Steel"" and a bombastic ""Sugar Hill Suite."" Disc Two's most interesting track might be Two Lone Swordsmen's remix of ""Funk You Up"", which submerges the original backing track in their familiar watery mix.In the end STILL/THE JOINT carries the banner for creative remixing and has spawned a few new classics from classics, which was the probable goal."
4,Good heart pumping workout without complicated moves,"I did this workout not knowing what to expect as I have read the reviews. I am an intermediate exerciser who likes to work up a sweat without the steps being too complex. I do this video on risers. It is 30 min of pure basic step so if you're into complex choreography, then you'll be bored. Some say it is repetitive, but I like doing the move enough times to know what I am doing and to benefit from it! I am not at the point where I want fancy footwork. The stretch at the begining and end were good and it was set to classical music which I thought was nice! The class seemed like a real class of exercisors. I recomend it to you if you want a good heart pumping workout without complicated moves! The negatives of this DVD is the production quality such as some blurry spots and the music is rather faint. In any case, it's still a good buy!"
3,basic step routine,"I am no stranger to step aerobics. I saw this DVD and thought I'd give it a try. I found her instructions very clear and her moves very basic and easy to follow along with. Other instructors can have you moving all around the board,spending most of the time trying to follow along. For that reason, I think you get a better workout from Kathy's video. However, the lack of variety lost my interest. I found myself watching the clock most of the time. I think this is a great choice for a beginner and an ok workout for the more experienced stepper."
3,"A Good Sweat, But...","This workout really builds up a good sweat. I enjoy Kathy's positive attitude and laid back style of instructing. I like that it feels like you're in a real workout class (with real people, not just pretty actors with fake smiles).The one thing that really bugs me about this workout, though, is the music... or lack thereof. The music is pretty faint in the background. When I do notice the music, it seems like Kathy is off beat in several steps. This makes it a little frustrating to follow. As another reviewer has stated, the music is a bit too fast in some parts for a step workout. This reviewer also noted the lack of structure in this workout, which I agree with. I enjoy step workouts that build up combos and put them all together... this workout doesn't do that.Overall, this workout is fine when you get tired of other workouts, but make sure you have a good selection for rotation as you would get bored with doing this one everyday."
2,Step routine off-beat and bland,"The 30 minute step routine consists of 2 sections: the first one is very basic for 15 minutes and completely boring, the second one is vertical on the step and a little more varied with more impact, this one wasn't as bad. Even though the instructor is pretty friendly and cuing is not a problem, she is constantly off-beat with the awful music. I had to force myself through it and not look at the screen because she was so out of synch. I worked up a sweat because I was using 2-lb hand weights but it was just not motivating to do. The 10-minute toning section consisted of a couple of leg lifts and push ups. I think the best part was the warm-up, but it was longer and slower than I'm used to. My suggestion: don't bother with this one."
5,"Outstanding workout, Kathy Kaehler delivers again!",I've been doing step aerobics on and off for over 10 years. And Kathy is the best instructor I've seen! My all time favorite has always been her Fitness System on VHS and now I have this DVD and she really delivers an Awesome workout! I've tried others for variety and I keep coming back to her. Your workout doesn't have to be overly complicated to be effective. I highly recommend Step Aerobics and I highly recommend Kathy Kaehler!
4,A great read for children!,My partner & read this book to our two children nightly for months at their request. We all enjoyed it. Great job!
1,Uninteresting Drivel,"This book is not good for kids. It's very dull, boring and poorly written. My child loves penguins and all kinds of different animals, but this book is painfully a chore to read. Bad writing, uninspired illustrations and dreadfully slow pacing make this book a prime example of F class efforts."
2,The story still needs open minds,"It seems that the New York penguin couple has split-up. Silo has left his male companion for Scrappy, a female penguin. This too tests our acceptance and is a testimony to diversity. Will there be a follow-up book that tells of the new saga?"
2,"Good story, but too preachy","If you want to indocrinate your children with the message of ""tolerance"" (i.e., nothing is wrong or immoral), then this is the book for you. If you instead love all types of people but do not accept that everything they do is perfect, then this book is NOT for you. The gay overtones in this book are quite heavy, especially when the author writes that the two male penguins ""must be in love.""This book presents homosexual relationships as healthy and a good environment for rearing children - it's dangerous to indoctrinate your kids with these false notions. Tolerance is good and it is a virtue, but acceptance is not. I can tolerate immoral behavior, but I don't have to accept it, and this book overtly and needlessly glorifies the idea of homosexuality.Since the book was written, the penguin couple has split-up; Silo left his male companion for Scrappy, a female penguin. This too tests our acceptance and is a testimony to diversity. Will there be a follow-up book?"
1,A political book and no longer a true story!,"I don't know if this was the intent of the author but from appearance this book is a ""politically correct"" statement to push the idea of homosexual relationships on children. That idea itself is shameful given the age this is directed at.And now this ""true story"" is no longer true. Silo eventually found a female mate and no longer is considered ""homosexual"".In fact, if you look up the case of Silo and Roy, you will note that the zookeepers wanted to introduce female mates but the gay organizations argued against it so the zookeepers backed off (thus leaving the two male penquins alone). If the zookeepers were allowed to do their job, rather than appease political correctness, these two birds probably would have had female mates and their own offspring years ago. Thus, I feel environment was the true culprit."
1,This story is based on a lie,"Roy and Silo, the two penguins used, as the ""inspiration"" for this bogus tale are not homosexual penguins. The moment Silo was introduced to ""Scrappy"" the female penguin he took off with her. Male Penguins often sit on eggs.Before you buy this book rent or buy the movie ""March of the Penguins"" and you will learn the truth. You can also Google the information I shared above.I think it's important that readers know the truth before they introduce their children to this awful indoctrination material.BEWARE: ""Just because it is written, doesn't make it so."""
1,Not appropriate for children,"I purchased this book, read it once, and promptly returned it. The book has one purpose - to advocate homosexual adoption. If as a parent, this is a message you want to express to your child, by all means buy the book. The message is not subtle; it is direct and is the only theme of the book. As a parent I feel that 6 years old is not an appropriate age to address the topic of same sex marriage and homosexual couple adoption.I simply felt there was no value or purpose to the book other than the social message. If you're not purchasing the book solely for this message - skip the book. I did."
1,Not for children,"This book is too much for children. I was given this book as a gift for my son. Didn't care for it at all so I went to read more about why it was written. I did go read about the story that inspired this book at the Zoo website, it's interesting, but that is all. And, now they are reporting thees penguins have moved on and found mates..... Buy a different book for your kids. There are so many good ones out there! :)"
5,Perfect,Absolutely The cutest story ever. We purchased it to introduce the different families to our 6 year old.
1,I was not pleased when my son brought this book home from his first grade book bin from an incentive program.,I was not happy when my first grader brought this book home from the class book bin as part of the reading incentive program. It is not a science/research book as it was supposed to be. Be careful what your children bring home as incentive reading.
5,Nothing but innocent,I think the controversy on this book is blown out of purportion. It an innocent but true story about 2 male penguins that raises a young chick. People need to come to the realization that just because the animals are of the same sex does not mean they are not capable of loving. I think more people should read the book and get over their homophobias.
5,Charming!,"I am a teacher, and had ordered this item to create a lesson for my middle-schoolers about finding many sources of information before reaching conclusions. We looked at a decision by a district in California to use this book as part of their anti-harassment curriculum. We examined news stories, editorials, the school district's website information page, and finally, the book itself. The story is sweet, and, I believe, portrays non-traditional families in a way that is healthy and appropriate for primary-level children, because it doesn't discuss sexuality; the focus is on families. The fact that it is based upon a true story lends credence to the message: that families with two daddies can raise a happy child, just like families with a daddy and a mommy. I have now shared the book with my daughter, to read to her son, who is a toddler. I recommend it!"
1,not so good,"I was curious about all the fuss concerning this book; so when I saw it on display at Borders I decided to read it. Now I don't care if a children's book features a father and mother or 2 mothers or 2 fathers, but it needs to be good. To me the plot in this book is really insipid and pointless; and the writing has a really cheezy tone to it. I would not be surprise if a child describes this book as boring. If you need to fill your political correctness quota, then I guess there aren't many alternatives out there; but if you want your child to hear a well-written story, avoid.And if you want non-fiction, please tell your child those 2 penguins broke up in 2009; one male penguin decided to hook up with a female and leave his male companion. Might as well teach kids about split ups and divorce while they're young, right?"
5,Sweet Story,"I got my copy of the book just days before the NYT article saying that the daddy penguins split up. It didn't make the sweetness of the story any less.I want my children to grow up knowing that there are a lot of different kinds of families in the world, and this is a charming, non-preachy example of one kind of family that you don't see in too many childrens' books.The illustrations are soft and attractive, and would probably appeal more to an older little one than to a baby or early toddler."
5,Jesus preached Love,"Love is a wonderful, many splendored thing. This story is beautiful, and my 4 year old and 2 year old love it. Same sex couples are normal and fine, and though I have a heterosexual lifestyle, the bigotry and hate from so called Christian's, makes me sick. Jesus would have been ashamed of you. Love is a blessing, wherever one finds it."
5,Kickin' video-what it is all about,"Amazing, extreme stuff on bike and board. Truly a different breed, these athletes that is. I highly recommend it!! Mostly action with commentary interspersed."
3,Good but not the best,"Good footage and review of the X-Games. However, the Winter X-Games, rollerblading, venues at other places than L.A. are underrepresented in this DVD.The only winter X games footage we can see is a performance from Shaun White, but what about skiing and snowmobile? all these sports are impressing too!And what about Taig Khris???A good point is the quality of the videos, you will love HD TV with this DVD.Sound is very nice too, but there is no european version of the DVD, subtitles are in spanish or french, and this just for the main movie.But despite of these drawbacks, I enjoy this DVD and I was waiting for something like this for a long time. Long live the X-Games!"
2,this is not a Gary Numan CD,"Why is this CD listed as a Gary Numan CD? It plainly reads, on the CD cover, ""Stephen Hero, ""DARKNESS & THE DAY"". What is the reason for this mislabeling? Listening to the sample tracks, the music doesn't sound like Gary Numan. I love Gary's music-especially his older stuff, all the way back to the Tubeway Army days. REPLICAS is one of my faves of his (technically a Tubeway Army album) as well as THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (nice Freud reference, by the way...)but this...this ""Stephen Hero"" character is something entirely different."
3,Van Heusen Men's Tall Easy Care Pinpoint Bengal,"Shirt looks nice, but seems less sturdy with more loose strings than a comparable-looking shirt from the Van Heusen outlet store."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!",The blaster is one of my favorites out of the series. It shoots the larger marshmallows up to 40ft!! Great to buy with the target!
5,Great fun!,"These were bought as props, and turned out to be the life of the party. If itis for small kids, just be Prepared to clean up all the marshmellows!"
4,Marshmallow blaster was silly and fun for summer birthday party,"Ordered a couple to have around with other gadgets (water pistols, etc...) for use at a summer birthday party in our back yard. Once we got the regular size marshmallows it worked great, and the kids were able to get the marshmallows to shoot a decent distance. Would buy a pair again for the same use - silly fun and laughs."
3,Marshmallow Blaster,"This is a fairly good toy but, you need to pump it up alot. It takes too much time to load and pump up in my opinion. It won't shoot far unless you pump it up many, many times. It is easy to use which is a good thing b/c it doesn't come with directions (or any we could find)."
1,Blaster Doesn't Work,"I purchased two of these for my son for Christmas, and I am very disappointed. The company claims the blaster works with store-bought marshmallows. It doesn't. So I purchased the ""specially"" formulated marshmallows for $10 including shipping from the company. That was nearly two weeks ago. So far I have received nothing. Even though I've emailed the company asking where the purchase is, they have not responded. Don't waste your money - poor product, poorer service."
3,good laugh for a day,"Bought this toy as a gift for my grown husband. It was fun for a few hours, but didn't work that well. Sometimes the marshmallows got stuck. Its loud. And now its just sitting in our closet taking up space. I think it was more fun as an idea in my head...."
1,What a waste of money!!!,"I bought my children the ""Marshmallow Shooter"", same concept but different design from the same company, but it does not work! Why do they even market it to shoot marshmallows? They always get stuck and DO NOT SHOOT! Then you are supposed to clean the chamber out. They know there is a problem with the marshmallows getting stuck because they give very detailed instructions on disassembling the unit to clean the marshmallows out. They should just sell the item as a ""pellet"" shooter and be done with it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Came broken - questionable quality,"I was so excited about giving this gift to a friend's 4 year old boy, so imagine how let down we all were when it didn't work! I'm not exactly sure what was wrong, but air kept leaking out and the gun wouldn't hold any pressure. (You can tell if it's broken if pumping the gun never gets any harder - the air isn't compressing.) Luckily, the boyfriend was around and he managed to fix it with his pocket swiss army knife which had a screwdriver. It took him about 30-45 minutes, and he had to take it almost entirely apart. Had he not been around, this would've definitely gotten returned.Once it was working, it was a pretty fun toy that even the adults enjoyed!"
5,Good choice,"Great choice. Follow the other reviews and make sure you get the cheap marshmallows. They work great. Might also want to be careful with small kids, because these things have enough force they can leave a mark at 20 feet. Everyone in the family (2 parents and 6 adult kids) got one for Christmas, and the battle was truly epic."
4,fun toy!,"The gun is a blast to play with. Easy to use and clean. The pump on the back can get a bit difficult for kids to pump to the required 12-15 pump limit. One minor gripe is that sometimes the pump chamber inside doesn't hold the air. The quick remedy for this is to pump rapidly to force whatever faulty valve inside to stay closed. Otherwise fun gun, marshmallows are harmless and biodegradable. Single shot large marshmallow or a blast of several mini-marshmallows for a shotgun effect. Make sure they're dry so they don't stick inside the chamber."
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this for my 11 year old nephew and he loved it! It is made really well. You just load, pump it up and fire. It only holds one marshmallow at a time, but it shoots really fast and far. You don't want to shoot someone too closely because it will sting a little. Just buy a bag of jumbo jet-puffed marshmallows from the grocery store and you are ready to play. I bought a bag to give him along with the blaster so he could get started right away."
1,fantastic,It was exactly what the Grand kids wanted. Was able to find without the hassle of crowds and driving all around comparing duarbility
1,"""A Warning to the Curious""","If I may borrow M.R. James' title, there is ""A Warning to the Curious."" It's necessary to read this novel with caution. Many of the quasi-military practices described in sister formation, daily life, and Sister Luke's exit from religious life appear to be unknown to most religious orders. Furthermore, Ms. Habets and Ms. Hulme apparently became life partners; that's pleasant for them, but does affect the views presented."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. To me, the scenarios presented in each chapter were extremely contrived, and perhaps just way too focused on the author's personality. I could not relate to a single one of them, and the settings really turned me off. I actually just threw this book away, something I rarely do."
2,Owww ... wide foot & narrow shoe!,"Love the look of the shoe for professional purposes, but as soon as I tried it on, I remembered that Vaneli's shoes run narrow ... and my foot does not. Tried to stretch them to no avail, so I ended up giving them to a co-worker who wears the same size but has a very narrow foot. They look lovely on her!"
1,BEWARE Does Not Work!,"I have wasted a week trying to get this device to operate properly. The Gafen tech support is unknowledgeable about their own product and were useless. Do not buy this product go with the Monoprice RS-232 Extender, which is less expensive, higher performance, and actually works"
1,Bogus CD,"This is a bogus Lee Perry CD. The only good tracks are lifted from ""Black ark in dub"", which is also semi-bogus.See upsetter.net for more information about bogus Lee Perry CDs."
3,Thoughts on a Revolution,"Chris Lindsay has done an excellent job of observing the strange and disconcerting practices of our government and social activities. I agree with him on many of the issues: help the needy, live by needs, stand up for your rights, etc. I do feel, however, that a more appropriate title might be ""Feelings on the Revolution."" Although equipped with a few poetic works, it seems to be mostly made up of examples and stories. I like the energy of the book and it feeds my wants for a better world, as I am sure it does for others. It is not very comprehensive, but something to read if you feel unsure about politics or social behaviors."
5,The Divine Plan,"In his introduction Mr. Barborka explains that while Mme. Blavatsky had written the definitive books on the subjects of Theosophy, they were difficult to understand by most laymen. He therefore undertook to study her works and wrote The Divine Plan as his explanation in good, proper order of all the concepts of Theosophy. This is an excellent book and should be in the library of any person who intends to study Theosophy. It covers much more ground than the usual introductory books by Judge and others."
5,"Entertaining, Sincere, Funny and Genuine!","Jay Leno has let us into his life thru this book. The good times, funny times, trying times and truly personal times. He's as entertaining on paper as he is in person! I have learned to like Jay Leno and enjoy his style of comedy. It took me a while, but this book actually put the finishing touches on my feelings. A really good book, full of fun, laughs, thoughfulness and honesty. Easy to read and most enjoyable. Get to know Jay"
2,Totally Dishonest,"I gave this book two stars because the stories that were in it were fun little anecdotes that I enjoyed. What left a bad taste in my mouth was not what was in the book, but what Leno left out. There is not a single mention in this book about the Carson-Letterman-Leno fiasco, and how it affected Leno's relationships and life. I promise you that if anyone were to give me the job as host of The Tonight Show, my autobiography would make SOME mention of it somewhere!! At least once!Secondly, he never once mentioned Helen Kushnick, not even in the acknowledgements. I know they had a falling out, but to not even thank her for the role she played in his career? The Tonight Show was practically in Letterman's back pocket before she stepped in. ""Leading With My Chin"" is Jay Leno completely sterilized...if such a statement is not already redundant."
3,Stick to the Tonight Show,"Not that bad, but Leno is much funnier on t.v. The book focuses on his life and how he made the big time. If you're looking for a biography of Leno, this one is acceptable, but if you're looking for some good laughs--look elsewhere."
5,What a guy!!!!,"I may only be a sophomore in college, but I have loved Jay Leno for years now. :o) I read his book and when I finished it I wanted to cry, simply because there weren't any more wonderful stories left to read. I didn't cry though--I just flipped it back to the beginning and read it again. This book really lets people into his life. He doesn't back-stab anybody or put anybody down, and his stories aren't ""And that's why I'm perfect"" He shows us the more human side of him, and his style of writing makes you feel as if you were actually having a conversation with him, and these were the stories he was telling you. These are stories that nobody will ever get tired of reading. They are no doubt stories that, if Jay were a father, his children would beg him to tell over and over again. This is my new favorite book! Way to go Jay!!! :o"
5,What a nice man!,"Jay Leno either is a very nice man or he's a total liar. I don't believe that it's the latter. LEADING WITH MY CHIN is his autobiography, and it certainly confirms his niceness.This is the brief, ""official"" version of his childhood and early years, in which he gives what seems to be an honest appraisal of his failures every bit as much as his successes. Many of the anecdotes, hardly unexpectedly for a person of Leno's skill, are hilarious. A few are oddly touching. Over and over, he proves himself to be caring and observant.It would be impossible to read such an autobiography without learning something about the making of a star comedian, and about the hard work it requires. Certainly, the determination to get as far as Leno and that handful of others have gotten must be fierce. It says a great deal about Leno's humanity that he has managed to keep intact his decency while he climbed to the very top of his industry."
4,A new paradigm,"In this book, research themes, which include perception, memory, language as well as high-level cognition, are explained in terms of computation. Their theory is based on brain science, computer science, and psychology. Though the authors speculate about the functions of each part of the brain and the relation among them to some extent, the authors propose a new paradigm to existing sciences. Their integrative approach and method are very simulative, and I've got a lot of hints from this book. But I don't need the usageof particular software, PDP++ in such a theoretical book. The authors explain and demonstrate their models and theories using PDP++ at the end of each chapter. If you want to study how to use PDP++ as well as their theories, this book will be extremely good one."
4,cyberpunk genre not quite dead yet,"You ever read one of those books where you start guessing what is going to happen next, and you're right? Well this was one of those books for me. Not that I'm clairvoyant, or possess any forecasting ability, but the book was so formulaic that guessing the turns in the plot simply could not be helped. Is that a bad thing? Not really. The book is very entertaining in a Matrix/Neuromancer sort of way, and is quite readable. Will I read the sequel? Absolutely, as I want to know where the author is going to take this. While not original, and you'll be able to cite obvious influences from other works, there just ain't much out there of this genre, and this one therefore is a satisfying read that measures up to the genre."
5,Excellent first novel by Mr. Giller!,"If you liked Blade Runner, A.I., Dark City, Escape From New York, The Fifth Element, Independence Day, The Matrix, Men In Black, Outland, or Total Recall, then rest assured, you'll LOVE this book! This new reality is superbly detailed and strikingly original. The pace is crisp and I guarantee you won't be able to put it down! All I can say is, it seems like a LONG time till next summer, when the sequel, PRODIGAL, comes out! I didn't want to restate the above listed synopsis. I want you to really be surprised by this terrific new book!"
1,there is nothing relevant to the GRE in this book,There is nothing relevant to the GRE in this test preparation book - I cannot recommend it
1,Man this guy is the worst author in american history,"I just finished reading Greg Longs book,The Making of Bigfoot,this book is a bunch of hear say and he said she said propoganda.He has no proof that Bob H was in the suit,just his word,he DONT have the suit,and when you listen to there promo of the book,they claimed that the suit was made of horse hair,but the story soon changed to be a suit made by a man in North Carolina.This book should be under FICTION,because there is no truth in this book."
1,Something to bear in mind.......,"In a recent radio interview, the author Greg Long refused to answer a simple question.Simply put, he was asked if he, Kal Korff, or Bob Kiviat (who also has an interest in this story) had paid Bob Heironimus (the man Long says wore the suit).His refusal to answer such a simple question speaks volumes. Read this book with that in mind."
4,"Not the final word, but worth a look to judge for yourself","I saw Long's book and, having a passing interest in Bigfoot, I picked it up to see what he said about the Patterson/Gimlin film being a hoax. I know the Bigfoot community is up in arms about it, but it seems to me that much of the comments are by those who have not read it, or already have their minds made up.I can't say that I cared much for Long's writing style, it was a little too personal, a little boring, and un-journalistic for me. And he may have overstated some of his claims, but a lot of people (not just Long) do seem to raise some very valid suspicions about the film and Patterson himself. You can't just ignore the evidence. The book is not the final word on the case, but its critics must do some real explaining, not just nitpicking, to dismiss it."
1,"""Anyone who has any intelligence...""","At the end of this book, costume maker Philip Morris is quoted as saying, ""Anyone who has any intelligence can see that it's a man in a gorilla suit."" So, Mr. Morris, you're actually admitting that your gorilla suits look like crap! Here's the test: make a gorilla suit that you could put beside the real thing in the zoo and not be able to tell the diffence! Good luck! Plenty of criticisms can be levelled at this book, but the bottom line, for me at least, is that Patty has yet to be ""counterfeitted"" down to the last detail. It shouldn't be that hard to do, if she were'nt the real deal."
2,the mystery remains,"seems to be too many contradictions and heresay for me to be taken as gospel, just like many pro-bigfoot stuff...we believe what we want to in the end until we find one I suppose. This book is for those whom do not believe in bigfoot, it certainly does not prove anything, just add more gossip and innuendo to the whole saga. Give it a miss..."
1,Poorly researched hypocritical trash,"I find it ironic that the author, Greg Long spends hundreds of pages berating the late Roger Patterson - accuses both he and Bob Gimlin of theft and deception, and yet the author and publishers of this book couldn't be bothered to seek permission from the copyright holder of the still images from the Patterson/Gimlin Film for reproduction in this book. Needless to say, Long and Prometheous are not paying royalties to Eric Dahinden either.How dare the author accuse someone of theft when he has just done exactly the same thing via a breach of copyright?This book is a cheap character assasination, and a poorly written one at that."
1,Utterly Awful!!!! A waste of good paper!!!,"This is the most horrible book I've ever seen written in my life, and I don't mean the worst Bigfoot book. I mean THE WORST book ever period!It is a shame that the publisher decided to waste their time and effort in printing this book of lies and slaps to faces. Nobody is ever going to get their money back on this book. You will be seeing this in the remainder bins very soon hopefully! $3.99 would still be too much for this junk."
1,Trash,"This book has it all !* Conflicting stories* A witness that claims to be the 'man in the suit', has tried desperately to profit from his 'confession', but doesn't know how he got to the film site* A suit maker whose suit doesn't match the description of the guy who is supposed to have worn it* An author who didn't even bother to visit the film site for himself or read some of the more important works properly, and who quite literally can't tell a left foot from a right foot !* An author who berates Roger Patterson for freeloading, but is happy to make one elderly witness pay for a meal for this 6'8"" author before she gets back into her 'old, beatup plymouth'Utter trash - don't insult yourself by reading this."
1,Actually no stars,"Auutor Greg Long claims to have proved the Bigfoot movie a hoax by finding the man who wore the suit and the man who made the suit.The man he claims wore the suit says it was made in three parts out of the skin of a dead horse, and smelled accordingly.The man who claims he made the suit says it was made in six parts out of ordinary costume materials.How does junk like this get published?"
2,Blue Screen of Death,"I have had frequent blue screen crashes, with error messages that make reference to the WPN111 as the cause of the ""stop error"". Netgear customer support was virtually useless. I was told to download and install an updated driver, which I did, but the problem is still there. The crashes usually occur during large file downloads, but sometimes they occur almost randomly. There doesn't seem to be any obvious solution to this problem, and I will probably switch to another product instead."
2,Doesn't work as good as WPN311 :(,"As soon as i added this to my XP machine - my RangeMax Router started freaking out and i had to reboot it twice a day (the least) - both of my adapters (WPN311 and WPN111) work great with a LinkSys router. Its a shame that Netgear products don't work with each other, when they are from the same like/package. Not very happy."
4,Item was horrible UNTIL DRIVERS WERE UPGRADED!!,"I puchased this product without reading the amazon reviews. I was having trouble connecting to my network, I would often lose my connection and occationally I was told that the router 15 feet away was out of range. Before throwing the product out, I upgraded the drivers, and it made a world of a difference. It works as advertised. (Now if only Netgear would enclose a CD with the new drivers)."
1,Total JUNK!! Buyer Beware!,"I bought this USB adapter to go with my NetGear router. It keeps dropping (all day long) my internet connection. The only way for the computer to recognize the adapter is to reboot--several times a day. Using Windows 7. What's more, NetGear support has been no help. I do NOT recommend this adapter at all."
1,Avoid Rangemax AVOID NETGEAR,"I ordered the Rangmax router/dongle pair. The router crapped out after 13 days. Rangemax tech support was useless. Tech support must be outsourced to India because they can poltely tell you to go to hell and eat up your time. I was fortunately able to return the router (to vendor: netgear had washed their hands of it).Then comes the WPN111: It works. Barely. Using there software, and following their instructions like sacred ritual, I got a signal so weak Windows wouldn't use it. Switching to the Windows manager, I have either a low or very low signal. My laptop, sitting next to the dongle, is a full five-bars excellent connection (TrendNet 'N' router replacing the netgear rat-cr*p). My D-Link 'b' also thinks I've an excellent signal.All the bad review prior to this, along with this, can be summed up into a single concept: however good they may have been: DON'T BUY NETGEAR."
2,Argh,Worked for three days and now it doesnt work at all despite the Netgear wizard detecting the wirless hub with a strong (77%) signal. There is no fix or upgrade for this product. Linksys is much better.
4,Works better than Belkin,"I have a 2 story house with the router and PC with the adapter on separate floors about 30' apart. I tried Belkins G router and adapter; No good. ""Low"" to ""Very Low"" signal and sometimes no connection or wireless network available. Then I tried the Netgear Rangemax Wireless Router with the Belkin card and got ""low"" up to ""Good"" signal with only my network available. After being online a few minutes the adapter got hot and cut out. I had to restart the pc. Now I purchased the netgear wpn111 rangemax and it and the router are working well together. It finds 5 different wireless networks in my area. It automatically connects to my encrypted network and gets very good signal (Mostly 4 out of 5 bars. It does vary from 36 mps to 56 mps at times but it seems to hold the connection OK for web surfing. After all the problems with Belkin stuff I'm happy this one works. I've only had it a few days so far but it seems MUCH better than the Belkin stuff."
1,Buggy performance,"I had no trouble installing the latest drivers to run under XPSP2, but this is a buggy little item. It constantly drops connections and restoring them involves either power-cycling the device or rebooting the system."
4,No problems whatsoever...,"I do notice that this USB adapter picks up about 1/4 of the available wireless network in the vicinity compared to my MacBook, but connecting is a breeze and i am very happy with this bargain thus far."
1,Stay away from this Netgear Wpn111 Rangemax,"Don't waste time purchasing this usb adapter! It had problems right from the start when installing the software. Had to call Netgear but guess what? They are outsourced workers from India who don't know what they are talking about! Believe me I had to go to their website to figure things out myself? Can you believe the US outsource jobs to other countries who can't speak english plus are not qualified to answer your questions? I called 3 times so it was not a coincidence? Anyways, keep away from this Wpn111 adapter no more range than a wg111t 108mpbs( Better to purchase the Wg111t because better signal than the Wpn111 RangeMax)"
5,life saver,"its a really kit, it will revive your pump, really easy to set up, i have no complains about it, its working non stop"
5,Unique,"Cool, unique color scheme. Got lots of notice from my riding group. I had the service guy at Performance put it on my new tri bike. The original white tape got nasty quickly! One order was enough to do the Aero's and drops."
5,Fun and comfortable,Easy to apply on the bike. Recently used for a 200 mile ride and they were extremely comfortable. I also got a lot of compliments on how it looked! (red/black/white splash design)
4,The red's a bit faded,"Looks great on my CAAD8 with my new bars, but the red in the red/white/black is not a full colored as one would hope so it looks just a hair lite-red (pinkish). Still looks great and unique and adds some character to the bike. And all the extra little stuff they package up are handy."
4,Great,I love the color and quality of the product. It did the job and came with neat chrome handlebar plugs.
4,"Works great, sticks just fine, gets dirty fast.","I don't care about dirt. If you do, you should pick a darker color. I put this on when my bike wasn't fully complete and it's filthy. I know you can clean it with lemon pledge, but I don't have any and it doesn't really bother me all that much. Nothing wrong with this bar tape for the most part. The ends that it come with are pretty cheesy and cheap."
1,Sappho Would've Leapt After Reading This,"That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If ""Sex and the City"" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.Feminism is not about having to use ""scary"" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever."
3,I enjoyed this book.,"I was drawn into this book by the fact that Jong had the audacity to write and rewrite Sappho's lyrics. I thoroughly enjoyed the point of view in which this story was told. There were a few ""anachronisms"" within it, but they were all modern words that could have been replaced with more historically accurate ones. All in all a good read."
4,Very enjoyable,"Wow, I'm surprised some people graded the book so low. I must admit, I don't really know the history of Sappho, so I can't judge. I only know her poetry.Regardless, I find the book quite enjoyable. I've had the book for several months now but I only take it out when I'm in the mood. I feel somehow like Sappho is a dear friend, sent back in time. LOL. I like that in this book, she goes through much of what many women go through.I find the descriptiveness that Erica Jong puts in the book is very helpful in understanding the rich beauty of such an ancient time. However, I do agree with some that the descriptiveness can go overboard. There were a few times where a character would go into an unreasonably long lecture where I didn't think it fit in.Anyway, it's a great book. I've recommended it to all of my friends because of the sheer joy I find in it. I really think it is a great book for any woman, straight or bi who wants someone they can relate to."
5,Erica Jong is a brillent Writer!,This is a FantAStic book. Erica Jong is such an important writer and it's so unfair that she has been so overlooked by many reviewers and readers. she is by far one of the best writers of her age
3,"Not bad, but not wonderful","I enjoyed reading this book, but I've definitely read better ones. The books tells the story of Sappho, the Greek poet/songstress of Lesbos. Yep, the one that inspired the word 'lesbian.' It's a biography of her life, so this is historical fiction, and it's kind of like an epic poem turned into a novel. Sometimes it came off too...intellectual? and not enough heartfelt. Like, I'd begin feeling like I was reading nonfiction instead of fiction. Other than that, it's a simple story with love, adventure, and magic, and it kept me suitably entertained, but not enthralled by any means. Go read it if you like Greek history and myth, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
1,A MAJOR Disappointment,"Erica Jong is an important writer. One had hoped that in writing about one of the first and most important characters in feminist history she would produce a book worthy of the challenge. Sadly she hasn't. How anyone could could make such a fascinating story boring I'll never know. To anyone wanting to read a novel about Sappho (based on the relatively few facts that we know) I would point them in the direction of Peggy Ullman Bell's excellent ""Psappha: A Novel of Sappho."" They should also get a good translation of the poetry of Sappho that was not destroyed."
2,A not-so-Merry-Christmas,"I can't think of one good thing to say about this product. I don't hate it, but I'll never play it. It has no redeaming qualities as far as I'm concerned. All I could think of when I previewed it was, ""Boy, this isn't what I expected."" Unless the product description sounds like exactly what you're looking for, keep looking. . . and Merry Christmas."
1,Deadly Conducting,"I am amazed that anyone could rate this disc highly. The conducting by Pesek is such a travesty. Of course Firkusny always plays well, but there is zero support for what he is doing throughout, and this can be clearly heard in the Third concerto when compared with the Palenicek/Ancerl performance. It sounds as if the conductor gave absolutely no thought to the shape of these works, and so it remains just a disc with great solo moments, but adrift on a sea of what has become vague and plangent Martinu-isms. Not a ""tribute"" to pianist or composer."
1,throw it out,"Once you start, you come to this village.you can't leave it until you have visited every shop and that takes awhile. When you get back to the farm, you can't find anything because you don't know your way around and you can't find the farm map and even if you can find the map, you can't get places cause it is out of order in comparision to the map.you tire out yourself just by walking around and cutting up plants. you can't do anything else. my opinion is don't buy the game. it is a waste of money. very disappointing."
2,Harvest Moon,This games is okay. When you first get the game it is kind of fun but then it gets boring. You do the same thing everyday over and over again. There might be something new everyonce in a while but still it is really boring.
4,"Great game, but a little too difficult","It's a great game, like all its predessors. The only problem I've seen is that it is a lot more difficult to make money from your crops. You also have to collect more grass to buy animals. I suggest you buy this game only if you are collecting them, otherwise, you should buy the title for the SNES, N64, Playstation, or PS2. This is because they have far more depth. Such as with the SNES version you can have around ten chickens, while on the gameboy edition you can only have four."
5,Farming Fun!,This game is very exciting! You grow vegtables and you raise your animals. There's festivals you celebrate in the town. I recommend this game to everyone. It take lots of concentration.
3,Harvest Moon's great...,"Harvest Moon 2 is a great game. You get the plant your crops in the pattern you want them to be in, fish, raise cows and sheep, and choose which new buildings (such as greenhouses, sheep and cow sheds, etc) to build if you have enough money from your produce. In town, there are some events you can participate in, but overall, you farm and farm and farm for money so that the mayor won't turn your farm into an amusement park after the period of time.It's fun and all...you get to choose what crops for what season (there are seasons, you know) and breed or buy or sell cows and chickens and sheep.However, after a while it starts to be become rather boring because that's all you seem to do: water and weed your fields, care for your animals, and fish for stuff for the market...that's why I rate it 3 stars."
4,Harvest Moon 2- Back to Nature,"This is an amazing game to play. It's good for children at least 10 or 11. There are some complications, and the kids might not know how to play. It took me a while to ajust to the game, and I'm 13! It's almost like the PS version, but not as clear graphics. I think it's better than the PS versions, because of the gameshark codes. I have never used them, but Ii'm looking forward to renting it on Gameboy Color, and buying the Gameshark, not only for that certain game, but for all my other Gamboy Color games."
2,An Strange Gothic Novel with an Ending that Leaves YOU Hanging and Unsatisfied!,"Bernard F. Conners' novel The Hampton Sisters (published in 1987 in hardcover by Donald I. Fine, Inc.) reminded me of Stanley Cohen's The Diana Game gone extremely Gothic.Two rich sisters, Emily and Lydia Morrow, beautiful look-a-likes, but extremely different: one evil, one good, night and day, residing together in a mansion-by-the-sea (in this case the Atlantic Ocean) adjacent to an extremely hostile no man's land known as the Sanctuary where spirits of the wronged-dead wait in limbo for revenge. This book had the atmosphere, but the abrupt, non-existing ending leaves readers hanging and very much unsatisfied. Read this book if you like novels having a creepy Gothic atmosphere, but steer clear of it if a complete plot with an satisfying ending is important to you."
5,Works great!,"I put this on the oil pan of my 2003 Honda Civic EX and it works really good. I tried putting it on a timer to have it go on for 5 hours before I left but timers are so unreliable and never go off when they should so I just plug this in overnight so that way it's nice and warm by the time I have to leave in the morning. Seems to work really good, my car starts much easier on the really cold Wisconsin mornings. The directions recommend using a silicone sealant to seal the edges of the heating pad, I went and got some to seal the edges to be safe. I have went through the car wash with undercarriage a couple times already and this thing isn't going anywhere. Overall product is really good, I would recommend it. Keep in mind that this is a 100 watt heating pad so according to Kat's website they say that this is for oil pans that hold between 2-5 quarts of oil so get the appropriate wattage heater."
5,Kats 24100 100 watt hot pad,"Works as described, just need to make sure that you give it at least 4 to 5 hours to warm your oil."
3,Be prepared for...,"If you're familiar with Billys dvds you know he does, in and out as one of his cardio moves. Well be prepared to do that about half of the dvd!No joke! But it is a pretty good pace."
4,Very Good Workout!,I am a fan of taebo workouts and this video proved to be an excellent choice. It is easy to follow and will be resourceful for even a beginner. I would definitely recommend this video to others!
3,Did not like this as much as others,"I only did this workout once mainly because I don't own an exercise step. I found it a little awkward to do some of the exercise without the step. overall, it probably would be a pretty good workout if you used the equipment with it. I have several other Taebo videos I prefer over this for that reason."
4,"Passion , humor and genius.","What are these other reviewers listening to? I wonder what they would say if they lived with this music for a little while. I will be the first to admit that Paul Simon's music can be uneven, but I don't see that with You're the One -not at all. The humor of Old, the passion of Love, the conversation style. You gotta give it at least a three for those alone. But I certainly don't need to defend one of America's songwriting treasures. You will enjoy the subtlety and genius of You're the One."
2,"Skip the CD, get the DVD","I know I am late to this party, but, if you read this, skip the CD, get the concert DVD, ""Paul Simon - You're the One, Paris 2000"". There is much more on it. Rip it with a DVD audio ripper to get your mp3's or your music CD."
2,a misha fan,"I was very disappointed with this video becuase of its very poor film technique. When will filmakers learn that close-ups of a dancer's face or feet during critical movements does not enhance the viewing experience. Fred Astaire was right all along. Dance should be filmed showing the entire stage setting, with all dancers shown completely, and not truncated from the waist up or the waist down. Can somesone recommend a properly filmed dance video of Baryshnikov? And while I'm at it, how about a DVD release of The Turning Point with some extra features showing the full ballets that were filmed for the movie?"
3,"Excellent book, bad quality photo reproducing","The book itself is excellent, an important reference study and a very amusing book for the lover of gems. The author is a leading American scholar in his time, this one is his best: informative with sound statements and principal references. When you read it, you can touch the atmosphere of the great collections arranged by him and the greatest library on precious and semiprecious stones, which he had.The only disadventage of this edition is the very poor photo reproducing of the original photos. The book contains many rare photos, but the reproducing is so bad, that they make you furious, if you see them.So, 5 stars to the book itself and zero for the photo reproduction."
3,The foundation for the study of Gemstone Lore,"This book ought to be required reading for all studying the occult aspects of gemstones, and even those that are interested in crystal healing. The material presented in this book is very informative, albeit outdated in some respects. Nonetheless, it is necessary to learn what the formative principles are in this field of study, and this book is an excellent look into the earlier work published solely on the topic of gemstones."
4,Nice addition to library,"I enjoy gemstone lore and this is a nice addition to my collection. The language is a little dated, a little dry, and the pictures are not great, but the text is substantial. I enjoy reading it. I would recommend this book."
4,Good product as expected from K&N,"I've always preferred K&N products as they tend to fully test their products before releasing them. I bought this for my '94 F350 as my brother has one on his '93 F350 and loves it. The kit noticeably increased the horsepower of my otherwise stock 460. The gas mileage is only a little better, about .5 to 1 mpg). I was expecting a little better, thus my rating of only 4 stars. My brother (an engine tech) is suggesting my stock 460 needs headers and aftermarket exhaust to fully realize the benefits of the increased air intake that this kit provides."
2,"A good compilation, but not worth the purchase.","I recently found this book at the local Barnes and Noble. I flipped through and found it very entertaining, and a fun read. But it's not worth the $20 so they priced it at. It's a good compilation, but like many other people said, it gives little or no direction as to where these locations are. For example, one roadide attraction in Florida was listed as 'on the highway just south of Jacksonville'. Not too helpful.All in all, if you're interested in this book, either take it out of the library or find a comfortable seat at your local bookstore and give it a look-through. It just doesn't make sense to spend the money on this book when you can find much more detailed information (and TONS more listings) online...and for free."
3,"Finding the ""weird"" all over the place","Like in their previous collection WEIRD NJ,Sceurman and Moran have created a book filled with odd tales, urban legends, and mysterious sites, but instead of limiting the scope to NJ they have spread the ""weirdness"" around to encompass the entire US. Most of the stuff is nonsense but it still adds up to a fun read. This one is a bit more professionally put together than the previous book, but the bottom line is that if you are looking for any kind of actual investigation into these ""weird"" tales, you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,"Weird stuff, but where is it?","I agree with another reviewer that if you're looking for a book on weird places to visit, you can't find a better book than The New Roadside America. Weird U.S. probably has a 10th of the content of Roadside America, and without an index of locations, it's hard to figure out what's near where you are. You'd have to go through each entry in this book and read the location. That said, this is still a good book for information of the spookier places in America. Haunted houses, ghost towns, strange lights, it's all here. So this is more of a compilation of American mythology than a travel book. And it's great to, in the process, find directions to these very out-of-the-way places. Although I am a bit concerned that with the publication of a book like this, a lot more people will be visiting them, which could result in them being closed off from the public, knocked down, what have you. Just look at the first entry, Dudleytown."
1,Mainly spooky stuff not the weird and wonderful,"I found the book disappointing as I was expecting more of the weird, meaning unusual, and wonderful. Probably ok for those wanting to know about the haunted tales of places.Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets"
4,Very Informative!,This is a great book if you plan to travel. It shows all the great places to stop at.
2,Weird US Book is a BUST,"This book lists loads of weird places to visit in the US but in no particular order. There seems to be no way to look up your location and on the spot see several sights to see. It's like a cookbook with meatloaf, split soup, carrot salad, and clam chowder just scattered all over the book. This book is certainly not a useful guide as such."
3,"Great Concept, Flawed Presentation","I love to visit offbeat places, so I thought that this would be just the book for me. I was disappointed.The first problem is that this is a compilation of many different authors and corespondents, giving the writing a very uneven quality. But the largest drawback is lack of a geographic index by state. When I am planning a trip, I need to be able to see which weird sites I can visit. Also, a travel guide should be compactly sized to fit in luggage, rather than this coffee-table sized hardback.Given the problems above, I'll have to stick to the original offbeat travel guide,New Roadside America: The Modern Traveler's Guide to the Wild and Wonderful World of America's Tourist, a bit outdated, but a masterpiece of goofiness and still the best in the field."
4,Weird!,"Indeed, some of the stories in here are weird. Some are interesting, and others are dumb. But overall, this is a very intriguing book and a great read!"
5,A Toutching Story Of A Real Person,"I love and have loved these two books by Billy Jr for years. I have read them 3-4 times and swear they only get better w/each re-read. When you finish the last page of Kentucky Ham (having read Speed first and the second book subsequently) you feel like you and Billy had just hung out together for a little while. And it feels like that evey time you read his stuff. How sad that he was indeed ""cursed from birth"" and had such a short sad life but how intruiging it was!"
4,Amazing books,"I never tire of reading these books and have read them over and over again. This book touches you especially if you have had an addiction to anything like drugs. William Jr can make you laugh and weep in the same chapter. These books leave you with a profound sadness but they stay with you even after you are done reading them. The thing is you are never done because I have returned to them over and over again. This is an honest look into the world of addiction. It's not a pretty picture but it is not a preachy book on the "" evils "" of drugs. It just describes the author's experience with speed. A terrific read. I know it will touch you as it has touched me. It is a shame that William Jr left us so early."
4,Junky before birth,"Billy Jr. is not the writer that his father is, but who is? If you are looking for the ... style(?) of the father forget it. Billy Jr. has his own style and it reads as something from the 60's drug culture instead of the 40' & 50's. Jr. is swift with his words and exceedingly hip with the lines: ""People who live in glass houses shouldn't get stoned."" So-o-o-o many of the lines in this book can easily be turned into book titles. It is a factual account of his depressing life addicted to drugs. Speed, is about his drug hustling in NYC and being bailed out twice by uncle Allen Ginsburg.Kentucky Ham, is his experiences coming back to Florida and then the Lexington Rehab Center. Of the two Speed is the better and quicker read. Ham has a tendency to drag toward the end and his life in Alaska fishing is downright boring. Overall both are a good read for a writer that was cursed from birth."
4,Truly unique,"This book is a refreshing how-to manual for ritual mysticism, free from the pompous self-importance of anthropologists and the airy nonsense of most new age authors. Alli's thoughts on the nature of ritual are iconoclastic (to put it mildly), but that's why I like him: when you read a book by Alli, you're entering territory that few other (published) authors have even sighted. This book also has Alli's usual weird but entirely appropriate illustrations.Whether or not you intend to put this book's suggestions into practice, this mind-expanding ramble through Alli's world is a lot of fun."
5,A Dream Book for Busy TEachers!,"It contains everything from lesson A-Z, writing samples for students to see, suggests books to go with every lesson and prewriting and final template. I love it!"
5,"Arrived fast, in great condition.","This is an old book, so I was surprised at the great condition it was in. It looked like it had come directly from the bookstore. There were no tears, stains, or writing on the dust jacket or pages. Aside from the author's website, these books are hard to find, so I was happy to find it at such a good price. I read these when I was a child and have wanted to read them again for a long time now. Grace Chetwin is a great author with a great style and a vivid imagination."
4,Quintessential Collection of War Study Essays,"I read through the entirety of this book while I was in graduate school. Each essay is well written and gives you an idea for the scope of the literature in 2000. The empirically tested articles raise unique question and attempt to answer them in thought-provoking ways. Well worth a read, as you will run through several highlighters in the process."
4,very good for beginners...,"This book is very good for beginners. Intermediate or advanced sailors could get some benefit, but I wouldn't recommend."
2,Poor Effort From Red,"This live recording doesn't come close to the greatness that can be found on Red's ""Midnight Rambler"" disc, but songs such as ""When My Mama Was Livin'"" and ""Ethel Mae"" are intriguing. Unfortunately, the opening track on this album is Red at his worst. As is always the case with Red, the slower songs which feature creative, personal lyrics are his best, whereas the up-tempo songs fail. When I saw him perform earlier this year, it became clear that he is well past his prime and should hang it up."
3,Product advertised is not what is being sold!,"In the past I've had great luck with Bug Stop from Spectracide and, after not finding it anymore in local stores, I decided to buy two cans from acehardwareoutlet via Amazon. Unfortunately, the product I received was different from the product shown on Amazon.As of this writing, Amazon shows a green can of Bug Stop Containing .1% Pyrethrins, .5% PBO, .2% Permethrin. This is the product that worked wonderfully for me in the past. But what I received was an orange can of Bug Stop containing .02% deltamethrin and .05% s-bioallethrin. Hopefully the formula I received works as well as the product I thought I ordered."
5,Bug Stop,This bug spray works great and doesn't have an offensive odor. I have used it for several years and will continue using only Bug Stop.
4,ok i guess,It dose the trick but you have to use almost half the can just to kill fly's but it did the job though.
2,Doesnt do the job it says it does,I purchased this to take care of my bug problem and I would have to spray many times to get the result I wanted!
1,not worth the money,Decided to really give this product a try. We have a chipmunk and skunk problem in our yard. Put the critter ridder in the skunk and chipmunk holes and...nothing. The chipmunk happily stayed and had no problem with the critter ridder whatsoever. The skunk also didn't seem to even notice. We used 3 bottles of the stuff and it didn't work at all. What a waste of money.
4,Rid your garden of critters,"Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular ShakerPretty good solution to deterring squirrels and other small critters from digging and hanging around your gardens without killing them. This was a re-order, and I'd do it again."
4,Did the job,"We had a problem with chipmunks in our yard. My husband sprinkled this all around the foundation of our house, and we haven't seen a chipmunk since then. We would definitely buy it again."
3,Worked well until it rained,"We have problems with deer, raccoons, possums, groundhogs and more, eating grapes off our vines and flowers out of the garden. I sprinkled CRITTER RIDDER liberally around both areas, and was really pleased for several days. I could literally watch the deer completely avoid both areas. Unfortunately about five days later we had several days straight of on and off heavy rains, and before I could re-apply the product, the grapes disappeared. Perhaps the product would work better in a drier climate than what we have, as I can see the cost being prohibitive if I have to re-apply it every week or so.When it worked, it worked great. But rain is NOT your friend when it comes to Critter Ridder."
3,can't quite tell if it's working,"I sprinkeled this around the permieter of my parked car because I had squirrels running up into my engine and snacking on nuts on top of my battery. This could lead to chewed up wiring. I can't quite tell if it's workin but I don't see squirrels running about. However, it's warm in Florida this time of year and the squirrels only seem to run up into my car during the winter months. I have noticed that the neighborhood stray cats are no longer leaving footprints on my car every night. So win! It's solved that problem. Will follow up when the colder months hit. There is no smell to the product but I did not take a big whiff. Just did not notice any scent when handling the product."
1,critter ridder,Waste of money. Squirrels did not pay any attention to it. I tried to treat small arear under trees to keep them from digging holes
1,Havahart Critter Ridder will not rid you of your critters,"I found this rather expensive product to be useless. A $16 investment will only cover 80 square feet. So, I used it sparingly around the perimeter of my lawn. Over the next two days, raccoons continued to dig up the lawn. I would look for other means to deter rodents... such as leaving out rags soaked in ammonia or sprinkling cayenne pepper on your lawn and plants. These are effective but require persistent applications."
1,NOT GOOD,"This did not effect the squirrels at all in our attic, it did make us have breathing difficulities and have to go to the doctor to spend more money!"
4,Seems to work O.K.,"I received this product through Amazon Vine. The product was placed in two areas. The first was around a small garden to keep out some rabbits & small rodents. It seems to have accomplished this mission but it was put down so thickly that mere pepper would have done as well. The second use was put around a mail box. While this product isn't a mole repellant it seems to work. So, this product does work as advertised. Generally, I use another product. This product is a natural repellant & has a rather nasty order so it should not be used next to a house. That is why it cost a star."
1,not a repellant,"I purchased Critter Ridder repellant to discourage raccoons from rolling up my sod. Not only was it totally ineffective, the day after applying it, raccoon sod rolling activity doubled! I ordered a live trap. I am considering using the remnants of Critter Ridder as bait for the trap."
1,didn't work on cats,"bought to keep our cats from using our garden beds as a litter box, don't work, cats kept going in garden beds.."
3,I only used it once.,"I used it once to ward off whatever dog seemed to be using the side of my yard (separating my house from a neighbor) as its poopie-ground. I haven't had the issue since.I suppose the dog could have been captured by Animal Control, but let's give Havahart Critter Ridder the benefit of the doubt, shall we?"
1,Doesn't work for groundhogs,"We have a groundhog living under our garage. We poured a whole canister down his hole and he still sits in there looking at us as if to say ""what was that supposed to do?"" Don't waste your money if you have real critters (i.e., anything bigger than a squirrel)."
1,One Star is Too good a rating,Product did nothing to stop squirrels from attacking my tomatos. I appled per directions to create a barrier.. the squirrels just played in the barrier area or stopped in it to eat the tomatos after stealing them from the vines. Product just does not work..period. Save your money and just buy your produce with it or buy new plants.
1,Completely Useless for Chipmonks,"I have a several chipmunk holes around my house which go under concrete and am concerned they are going to damage the foundation. So I bought the spray AND granules neither worked a snot. I then took the remaining product and COMPLETELY filled the holes with Critter Ridder. Within hours the chipmunks just pushed it aside and continued using the exact same hole. Do NOT buy this for chipmunks it is 100% ineffective. It would be worth the price if it worked, but it was absolutely useless for every chipmunk hole I used it on. Save your money buy a trap. I doubt they even tested this on chipmunks. It may work for squirrels but they are wrong about Chip and Dale."
1,Critter Ridder does absolutely nothing,Don't waste your money on this product. It did absolutely nothing to deter raccoons. If you want to stop raccoons you have two options: 1) Trap 2) Gun
2,A Colossal Failure for Me: Raccoons in My Trash,"I was excited to try this, as I've had raccoons knocking over my garbage and recycling cans for weeks this summer. I followed the directions and applied lots of this all around the area where my garbage is, even sprinkling a little in the garbage for good measure. I closed the lids tight. That same night, it was worse than ever-- garbage knocked over, trash all over the side of my house. By the time I saw it, there were flies swarming and birds picking through it... meaning that I guess flies and birds don't mind this repellent either!It would be one star except that I do like the idea that it's safe and approved for organic gardens-- but it's clearly not effective in all cases.It leaves a peppery smell in the area, and you're advised to wear gloves while applying it."
1,Did not work for my problem,"I have a severe squirrel problem around my house. The chew the cable line outside, they have even been in the house one year. I also have a large chipmunk population that creates other issues as well. I thought, hoped, prayed that this would work. It didn't. They are still all over. Don't waste your money folks. I suspect I'll have to start trapping them and ""re-homing."""
4,Good if used as part of an overall strategy,"I've tried using assorted repellents like this for a while, always with mixed success. It's mixed enough for me to somewhat suspect more of a placebo effect--I want it to work so I think I notice more effect than it has.However, that being the case, there is enough of a indicator it has an influence in keeping away pests. But, I've found that if I try to use this as a complete solution, I'm both disappointed and quickly run out. For me it works best with more of a targeted approach, using it where I particularly don't want pests to be or to go through--gaps in fences, openings between brush. I have to be careful because I likewise don't want to use this where I or my family want to be.Mostly, I find it's helpful to keep our yard a relatively unfriendly place--so that we don't get overrun. I've noticed a decrease in critter activity, so for that I keep using it."
3,Doesn't last long,My goal for this product was to help keep the neighbor cats out of my flower and veggie garden. I followed the instructions on the container and I did notice a little less activity but one running of the water sprinkler seems to dissipate the strength of the granulars enough that the cats are able to ignore it.
3,Effectiveness is iffy...expensive for the amount provided..,"This stuff sure smells spicy - black and hot pepper spicy. It comes in a nice shaker and is considered organic.The issue seems to be that it has a limited effectiveness. I shook it around our garden and under the birdfeeder where the squirrels and chipmunks congregate, but they either got used to it right away or I didn't use enough. That's the other thing - for the price this seems to be a small amount and did not go very far. The container is quite a bit less than I was expecting - 5 lbs is not much at all. They indicate this is enough to cover 300 square feet but it's pretty hard to shake it out that finely or evenly so your'e really only covering perhaps 100 square feet."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. I hoped to dissuade the chipmunks from eating the plants on my deck and to stop whatever kind of creatures were munching on and destroying some of my sunflowers in a small side garden in the yard. There did not seem to be any success in either place and I have to say, on my small sampling, that this product did not work as advertised."
5,Got rid of the chipmunks,"We really only wanted to rid ourselves of the pesky chipmunks stealing our bird seed and planting in all the flower beds. We put the Critter Ridder down and I haven't seen one in the area we protected since doing so. So, so far, so good. I am going to purchase another so I can sprinkle all around the house."
2,Save the Money and Get a Dog...or Some Big Cats...or a Snake,"I really wanted this to work...we have had major problems with various critters eating our garden this year...most of our plants have been stripped, nibbled to nubs, dug up, or eaten as seeds. For certain there are some rabbits, some mice, some birds, chipmunks and lizards involved here to varying degrees. This just flat didn't help. This was no more effective than sprinkling cayenne, spraying garlic or anything else we've tried. It's a nice big bottled filled with stinky powder that doesn't do anything more than use up some money that could feed a nice snake for the garden, dog for the yard, or cat to attack visiting rodents. I've tried way too many sprays and powders by now and am moving on to fences and hanging baskets. For a minor problem this may be worth something to someone...though I'd go for cayenne over this for the neighborhood cats pooping in the yard. This won't save what the non-domestics want to nibble."
2,"you can use a cheaper, safer alternative","After trying this product, I agree with other reviews that it doesn't last 30 days. The price point is high for what you get. I prefer going to BJ's or Sam's Club and picking up a vat of black pepper and/or Cayenne powder and sprinkling it around any perimeter where you don't want critters and it is cheaper to use & I feel safer. I've used the black pepper before around the perimeter of our home to deter black ants and it works. We also use the black pepper & cayenne powder around our veggie garden to deter animals away. We reapply as needed, but it seems once they know it's there, they find somewhere else to dine. I've also used moth balls around my flower gardens to deter cats from eliminating in them."
2,irritant,"Package says the active ingredients irritate animals when they touch or taste the product. Also lists that the poison control center should be contacted if the products gets on your clothing and contanimation of food and water should be avoided. Because we have young children and pets, I don't think we will actually chose to use this product due to saftey and ground water concerns. I would rather have pests dig up my lawn than end up taking our pets to the vet or the kids to the doctors for medical treatment."
2,Maybe I just have hungry animals,"I applied the product as stated, still had problems. I even threw it in a garbage can with 1 bag of garbage to see if it would scare anything off.. nope. Luckily my garbage is far away from the house where it isn't a horrible issue and I can feel good I feed the critters all year round."
2,The cats could not care less,"The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well. I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre. One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most. No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all. In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days. The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be: 2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70. From what I have observed this past week, it would not be effective."
3,does it work,"Short of shooting them, I have looked for other methods for discouraging the squirrels. I actually boughta high velocity pellet gun, but the neighbors thought it was a .22 and I decided not to furthertest the ""discharging a firearm within city limits"" statute.Next I tried a humane trap with a bowl and trail of cashews; voila' it worked- but not for the squirrels-I caught a juvenile possum.So someone told me about pepper products and this came up on the Vine list. It worked for about three days.Then the squirrels were back to digging up my vegetable and flower gardens like they always have.Disappointed to say the least.Didn't work for me."
3,Too Expensive,"A $30 package covered one application for a number of flower beds. The price is out of line with what the product offers, especially since it loses its efficacy after rain."
1,Does not work for skunks,Tried this product to help us deter skunks digging up the lawn for grubs. It may have deterred the skunks for one(!) night but most likely they filled their belly somewhere else. Havahart is being very generous in their marketing saying that it lasts up to 30 days. Perhaps if the lawn was literally buried with this stuff. Not worth the money.
3,Not a Single Solution,"As the container says, Critter Ridder works best in conjunction with a fence or some other barrier. With that in mind, I applied it around the perimeter of my fenced garden. Several rabbits had managed to beat the fence. With the critter ridder, only 1 rabbit was able to make it in. So, it was not as effective as I have hoped but I was pleased to reduce the rabbit pillaging."
2,Ineffective at best,We have a raccoon problem in our area and looked at this product as a good option to keep them out of our garbage. The fact that it is natural/organic was a plus in deciding to try it. But the pluses ended with the product description for this very ineffective answer. Despite using it heavily especially in the vicinity of our trash the repellent did anything but. We even tried spreading it heavily on the cans. It did not stop the animals from continuing to attack our trash.Sounds like a good idea but just doesn't work.
2,Not for Chipmunks!,"I will update this review in time if a different conclusion is reached, however, after about a month of time and two applications we still have chipmunks burrowing under our step and patio. I will say that it seems the chipmunks frequent our patio and back step LESS now than they did a month ago, but they are not gone. I think this product would be more effective if all of my neighbors used this product too. I live in a suburban area and our yards are small and our houses are close together. I know that all my neighbors have chipmunk problems too, so maybe if we all used this product, then I would find this to be more successful."
2,Won't stop determined skunks,"I tried this product as a deterrent to some skunks that were digging around my porch and found it to be totally ineffective. I sprinkled some in the burrow, just outside, and even mixed some with dirt I used to fill in the hole. They came right back and dug it out again. Perhaps this works as a casual deterrent, but in this case I think the skunks were determined to get out of the cold."
2,Cats seem to ignore it,So far after two intense applications the cats pretty much ignore its presence completely. I may try it in combination with another product because it does not seem effective on it's own and it is too expensive to have no effect.
2,Did Not Perform,"I had high hopes for Havahart's Critter Ridder. I live in a neighborhood that doesn't really have any public space to it, so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor's to clean it up. There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns. I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border. Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn. They didn't even appear to be affected by the repellent, so it wouldn't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent, but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution. There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard, even the very next day after using this."
1,Don't work,I put it around my fish pond to keep the cats out of there.And the dogs i got up in the morning and a dog was in the pond.and the cat still come over.
1,Repel this product,The racoons and skunks failed to read the propaganda and as a result walked all over the fobidden ground munching as they went.
2,Save your money,I bought two containers of this as I have many critters roaming where I live and I hate to say this but this stuff just doesn't work. I sprinkled it around the outside dirt away from where I had my tomato and melon plants only to have the leaves stripped from all my plants. You can't sprinkle it near your vegetable or fruit plants. Irregardless the critters had a feast of newly planted young plant leaves and left me with just stems. My garden is gone. I also tried it near my flowers that were being eaten and it didn't help any either. Needless to say I not only lost my money but my garden and flowers.
1,I would not recommend Critter Ridder Animal Repellent!,"I purchased the Critter Ridder Animal Repellent Granular Shaker on Sunday. I used all two pounds in my front flower bed to keep the neighbor's cat from using my yard as a toilet. Today is Tuesday, and the neighborhood nuisance is back peeing and defecating in my yard. I definitely would not recommend this product! Maybe this company should ""have a heart"" and stop taking peoples money for a product that does not do what it claims to do! It appears that haveaheart.com is padded with positive reviews of their products. Hopefully that is not the case here... NO STARS!"
2,"Critters 10, Ridders 0","Among other gardening pursuits, my wife and I have a modest little strawberry patch. However, we also have a local population of squirrels, chipmunks, groundhogs, etc., etc. Thanks to the wildlife, we have yet to see a single ripe strawberry; as soon as a berry begins to ripen, it's a sure thing it will be gone by the next day.So I tried this product on our strawberry patch. I applied it a little more liberally than the instructions indicate, replenished it after heavy rains, and followed all other instructions on the container.The result is... we still have not tasted a single home-grown strawberry. The strawberries are still being pilfered by critter or critters unknown. This product may work for some people, to some degree, under some situations. On the principal of giving the manufacturers the benefit of that doubt, I'm giving this review 2 stars. But in the test just described, I'm afraid it came up a total bust."
1,Don't waste your money,"A raccoon was doing and leaving his ""business"" on a specific spot in my back yard...I witnessed him! I thoroughly sprayed the specific area with Critter Ritter. Next day I found a new deposit on the previous deposit. Couldn't be any clearer than that."
2,Did not work for me,"I applied this liberally around our back entrance which is frequented by squirrels, raccoons, possums all who know what else at night. While most of these critters are not problematic, the raccoons are a nuisance and empty our birdfeeders and even our hummingbird feeders. After sprinkling this product around the entire area, the racoons (and squirrels) pretty much ignored it. I have found success with Deer Away spray which works much more effectively."
3,I still have a rabbit invasion,"I got this in hopes it would stop the rabbits in my yard. I applied it as directed in paths of the critters. I did not notice ANY improvement, nor did my cocker spaniel seem to stop at it's locations. I wish I could report it works well, but not for me id doesn't. My imagination says it kept them at bay for maybe a day, but a no rain day later, things were back to the way they were. I think it was my imagination. I have not had luck with any product. Nothing more to say about this - it failed me."
2,"May work for squirrels, but absolutely not chipmunks!","Maybe Havahart wised up & stops listing chipmunks as one of the targeted rodents, but the 2-lb bottle I got from my local Home Depot still lists chipmunks (text & photo) as a targeted rodent and I was duped into getting this. I used it according to directions & there was no rain/wind for a good 2 days after application. I haven't seen a squirrel since but my chipmunks are ATTRACTED, not repelled by it. So this product (or its earlier ver. still sold by Home Depot) is useless towards chipmunks. It may work well for squirrels from what I observe. I returned my bottle to H.D. today albeit I used 95% of it already."
1,Squirrels laugh at this stuff!,"Bought this from Lowes and spread it generously around an antique outdoor wood piece which sits on my side porch. Opened window one day to find a grey squirrel sitting right in the middle of this stuff chewing on the wood piece again, and looked at me while still continuously chewing. If he could have been capable of laughing at me and saying ""hey buddy, this repellant doesn't work too well"" he would have. Immediately took back to get full refund. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this junk. Scared to try anything else now."
1,Expensive and useless,"I tried the spray bottle version which was supposed to work on squirrels and chipmunks. I was having problems in my garden and thought I'd give it a try. I followed the directions and it had absolutely no effect. Hell, I think they like the stuff! Save your money....a bad deal!"
1,Does Not Deter Racoons,I live in the country and have several Bluebird and Tree Swallow Houses mounted on 6 foot poles scattered about. Racoon(s) began raiding the nests. I bought the pellets and the spray. Scattered a whole box of pellets around the ground where I still had active bird nests a couple of weeks ago. I used the spray just yesterday on the ground around these nests and sprayed the steel posts the Nest Boxes are attached to. This morning I checked the closest Tree Swallow nest to my house and sure enough a Racoon had a late night dinner of the two baby Tree Swallows inhabiting the nest and the nest was all torn up. The spray could not have been any fresher as it had been applied only a few hours before this attack. I have to say that this product simply does not work. At least with racoons.
1,Lasted a whole 4 days.,"Purchased at Lowes to keep my dog from digging holes in my landscaping. Scattered it on Monday, had new holes by Friday."
1,The Worst Repellent,This product is a total waste of money!! I think it actually attracted the squarrels to my roof.. I was better off using the pepper from my kitchen then this waste of a product..
1,Junk,Does not work at all: the cats feel quite comfortable leaving their droppings in the same spot these granules were applied.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,It just plain doesn't work. Used it. Raccoons went right over it! Didn't phase them. Time to take out the traps again.
1,Animal Repellent Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 didn't work,"This item is a waste of money. I used it in my flower garden and the perimeter of my veggie garden. Within 3 days all my Holyhocks, Lupine, Zinneas and Cosmos and all my young veggie plants were eaten down to the ground!"
1,Havahart Critter Ridder,"This product did NOT reach anywhere close to my expectations. The seller was promt and easy to deal with, but truthfully, the product itself was basically useless. Just my opinion, but I wouldn't waste my time or money on this again."
4,It's keeping the cats away!!,"Earlier this summer, we updated our front yard. We put in new flowering plants and covered the dirt with special paper to help deter the weeds from growing. On top of the paper, we laid down black mulch. It looks so nice! The beautiful effect to the whole front of the house is huge. We're so happy.But, then we started getting cats pooping in our mulch! GROSS!! Yuck... They would come and mess up the mulch and do their thing. Then we'd have to clean it up. Not nice.We used the Critter Ridder on half the area. On the other half we sprayed vinegar. Both areas have not had any 'kitty gifts' since we applied both products. The one big difference between the areas: the cats still come and move the mulch around in the vinegar area. No poop, but they still make a mess for us to clean up. Drives me batty.This product works great for what we need it for. It's a 5 star product for us, but I took away a star because it's so darn expensive! But, it works."
1,Kept the Rabbits Away for a Day,I ordered this product in desperation. The rabbits and squirrels ate most of my garden. I got this product and applied it around the perimeter of my garden area as the label says not to apply directly to plants you plan to eat. 1 day things were good then my peas disappeared. I am very disappointed.
1,"I really needed this to work, but it back fired","I I have a skunk that has taken up residence under my sidewalk. I tried replacing the soil and gravel that it was excavating. It just kept digging. I covered its entrance with bricks, it just pushed them aside.Then I found this Cridder Ridder, which seems like just what i needed. I pourted it all around the perimeter of the side walk.So the skunk is just working hard at coverpowering the spicey smell of the Critter Ridder with it's own scent...The strongest skunk odor I have ever experienced!This may work with deer, but apparently not skunks!"
1,Save Your Money,"This product does not work on cats and skunks. Save your money. I gave it one star because you can't give it minus five starsCats were sleeping under a bush in my yard on hot afternoons. I applied a lot of granular Critter Ridder. It had absolutely no effect on the cats. I finally removed the bush. I have a skunk who digs a hole under my fence every night to get into my yard. I applied a thick layer of the product on his ""digging area"". He dug right through it the first night. I applied more Critter Ridder. He dug through it again. He still visits nightly."
1,Apparently they did not test this on southwestern critters.,"Maybe my New Mexico critters are used to spicy food (this is the home of green chile after all) and the capsaicin and black pepper in this product just made them want to grab some chips and dig in. I put this around 2 rose bushes that the rabbits and ground squirrels have been chewing on.The squirrels and rabbits happily snacked on my roses with this product applied liberally to the area around the rose bushes. I watched them sitting on the product, eating my rose bushes.Perhaps they tested this on squirrels and rabbits who have no taste for chile. Mine were yelling for me to throw out some tortilla chips."
3,Critter Ridder,"It works for must animals but not for Groundhogs, they just go over the Granular, just don't work for them."
2,Not a critter ridder,"We applied this generously around our front year, and by next morning--we had even more evidence of skunk and raccoons digging in our grass. Now we set traps--we'll see what happens. The pro-pest guys laugh at the crystals/poweders for raccoons and skunks--they will dig to get to worms no matter what."
2,Did not work for me- cat,I wanted to try this product as some unknown critter keeps going into the mulch around my fruit trees and strews the mulch into the lawn. Every few days I have to take a rake to repair. I think it is a cat as there is a feral cat in the neighborhood that likes to have romantic trysts on the fence waking me at night.I applied on a sunny day as directed and within two days my mulch was disturbed. We had not had any rain although the yard does have a sprinkler system. I personally believe this product would do best in warm areas as the heat makes the included peppers more pungent.
2,Didn't stop the Squirrels,"I was hoping that this product would keep the squirrels out of the fruit trees, but it didn't phase them.One of our pear trees is far enough from other trees that they can't just jump from tree to tree, so I decided to try this product around it. Less than an hour after applying the product all around the tree, the squirrels were crossing the band to climb and retrieve fruit.Other reviews seem to indicate that it work from some people in some situations, but our squirrels are determined to strip the fruit from every tree and this product didn't stop or slow that process."
5,Definitely Works.,"We have acreage that is most attractive to a wide range of ""critters"", who find it a convenient place for eliminating their waste. Not merely cats and dogs, but also skunks, raccoons, bears, and other animals have been using the property for years. We have tried many products, but none had much effect until we applied Critter Ridder. Wherever it is sprinkled, it discourages the animals. This is the best of its type! Its container is easy to use and very durable."
4,Incisive and Thorough,"This book provides an optimistic outlook on the relationship between people, technologies, society and the environment. It is thorough and sometimes dense with references and academic counterpoints. Feenberg is aware of the risk of abstraction and does his best to ground his ideas in practicalities, but still does not always provide sufficient concrete suggestions about directions forward. There is an unapologetic socialist agenda to Feenberg's project and while this is by no means orthodox or overwhelming his proposals do seem unnecessarily constrained by concerns over class and power struggles at times. The book is well written and reveals a thoughtful and sharp mind at work. Recommended to all concerned with the role of technology in shaping our future."
1,Problematic Product,I would not recommend this pci based product. It is very problematic to get working at all. It seems to have difficulty with IRQ or other conflicts that other similar cards can resolve without difficulty. On no less than 3 Windows 2k machines with latest sp's I ended up pulling all cards out except the video card to even get the computer to boot with the netgear card installed. I purchased this to support airopeek traffic sniffer from Wildpackets for my job. After several hours of difficult troubleshooting I shipped the netgear product back and instead purchased one of the highly recommended Cisco dual band cards.
4,Connect-me wirelessly!,"I highly recommend using this product with a NetGear Access Point or NetGear firewall combo-device like the FWAG114. The only caveat is the signal was sometimes surprisingly low in a small area, but as it constantly polls different frequencies, it improves over time."
3,A nice book.,This is a very nice book with lots of beautiful photographs of cats. It does not have much text but the pictures are great.
5,One of the best books I ever read.,"The book of signs is,I think, one of the best books ever writen. It's got acttion, commody,and the best team of heros ever thought of. I know this on account of I've read it three times."
5,This is the best book I ever read !,"This book is about 3 people, Score, Helaine and Pixel. They have exiting adventures and it feels like the characters are real! I think everyone should get to read this fantastic book. I read about 50 pages and then got so interested in the book I read the whole book. This is the best book I've ever read,and the most exiting adventure story I ever read! I can't wait for the other book!"
5,This book is action-packed.,"This book had action on every corner. One minute Renald, Pixel and Score are fighting someone, and the next minute they're friends with the people they were fighting! Every character is unpredictable. This book is way cool."
3,This book is ok but i think it shames the other Diadem book.,"I didnt particlurly like this book as much as the others in the Diadem series. I think he over played a lot of things and it was WAY corny and stupid in some places. In my opinion, Book Of Signs shames the other books."
4,"Entertaining, but........","This is a very entertaining, honest documentary and very beautifully done. However, it is blatantly obvious that this was made by Priscilla for Priscilla. She must have needed needed another Elvis cash injection. It should have been called the Beaulieau's and Jerry Schilling on Elvis."
1,Upset,I wasnt aware that this DVD would not be able to play in the U.S. More importantly i was misled and now im stuck with a useless DVD. Thanks
3,Good but..,"I found the dvd presentation fresh and informative and it filled alot of gaps for me in the history of the great man.Please someone tell me though:WHERE IS CHARLIE HODGE? For me his absence creates a significant vacuum. I hope the fans agree..Hence the three star review.P.FlynnDublin, Ireland."
3,"O.K. , but....","This is another creative way of making money. Same old story with same old stuff except for a few home movie clips which were shown over and over again. The documentary is mostly about the ""Elvis-Priscilla"" times. Maybe you (not me) might like to know the fact that Elvis & Priscilla once used LSD or that he would not make love to her anymore...blah...blah...blah...I wish for a documentary by Scotty Moore or the other musicians that toured and recorded with Elvis during the early years. That's what I am interested: the young, the energetic and creative ELVIS."
1,sent to me broken,"I wish I can view this item I bought. Its damaged & I don't know how to send it back cause it came without a slip! I've tryed playing it on several cd players & it does'nt play. How can I return it? Is this what Amazon.com does? Send out damaged items? What can I do to return this for a refund?Sincerely, Carmen R. Verdugo-Woody"
1,Buyer beware,"I recieved this DVD in hopes of giving it as a Christmas present. However, to my dismay, I discovered that it is encoded for PAL which is a standard not used in the United States. Also, the product arrived unwrapped, and the case was broken. So, my review relates more the product, and less about the show itself (which is great)."
3,Missed Opportunity,"It's a mystery, but somehow they have rendered Elvis and his story duller than you could imagine! This is largely a yawnfest of unending Priscilla propaganda. Less interviews and more music would've been this concept's saving grace; alas they missed out on that, the one thing that made Elvis--his MUSIC!! I understand this was to be a personal history by those related to him, but they had Schilling in? Why not some fellow musicians? Guys like Burton or Tutt or contemporaries like Tom Jones? Why not different Memphis Mafia members like Esposito or the Wests? Gee, let's guess, especially as to the latter. Despite the fact that Elvis needs no help in maintaining his mythic status, Priscilla guards it jealously and refuses to let other opinions be heard. Too bad. It get three stars BECAUSE IT IS THE KING AFTER ALL...but it could've gotten five if it had one more hour of music replacing an hour of talk, and if other voices were allowed to be heard by Empress Priscilla."
4,tv special and book,"I enjoyed the special, especially the outtakes and home movies plus the photos. I think this was long overdue. However, I believe some private conversations between husband and wife should be kept to themselves. There are too many people looking for negative things to say about Elvis already."
2,Mucho rehasho..........,"Actually, a review of the tv special. Much of what was discussed was old news-easily available in Guralnick's fine bio CARELESS LOVE and Jerry Hopkin's ELVIS:THE FINAL YEARS. While it was interesting to hear some of it from Lisa and Priscilla, it still presents it from one point of view. According to most involved, Elvis's wife was seeing Mike Stone for quite some time before she left Elvis, aided by several of Elvis' freinds and their wives- a detail she conveniently left out for understandable reasons. It would be interesting to see what is included on the dvd but left out of the tv show-although I suspect the best they had to offer was already aired."
3,3 good tracks,"There are 3 songs that I really enjoy. I can listen to 2 of them over and over. Was it worth buying the cd, maybe. But maybe not."
4,"Cool, but dissapointing","I just got this lego today and i was SO exited. When i finished building it i loved how it looked. But after a while of playing with it i started to wish that LEGO had put more thought into it. I mean, there are 2 secret compartments on the Y-Wing but the set doesn't come with anything to put in them.And on the TIE ADVANCED there is nowhere to put Darth Vaders' light saber. And his cape gets wrincled up. Despite all of those facts it still can be fun."
4,Fine Lego Set,"This is a set I bought for my birthday a few years ago. It is a nice set, I like the Y-wing the most. It is quit sturdy with two storage compartments. It also has a red droid and pilot. The rotating turret is nice, and the engines are really cool. The tie fighter is not bad, but I do not really like it. It has Darth Vader with a cloak and light saber. It has two guns on the front. They are actually two red lights on the cockpit. The wings can and will sometimes fall off, but if you would like a tie advanced fighter it would be good. The top and bottom parts of both wings and can be adjusted to different angles. It is the most expensive Lego set I have purchased. I believe I got it the year it came out so it was fifty dollars. Now it is expensive but you might be able to get it used on eBay for cheaper. Overall this is a nice set and you could sell now or a few years later for a lot of money. So, if you like one or both of these set from the star wars movies this would be a good set."
4,Another Solid Racer,"I admit when I first played this game with my friend the night i bought it I thought to myself, ""Why in the world did I buy this game?"" Now I haven't had the luxury to play Gran Turismo, but I have played many racers before and I can say now this is by far my favorite. If you can get over the steep learning curve (the controls are hard to get used to) and spend some time in championship mode you will find this game hard to put down. Whether you're racing a Acura NSX you spent $140,000 to [prep] or racing a car you made from the very cool ""Carrozeria"" you will love this game. The reason this game gets 4 stars instead of five is because it's two-player racing is only about as half as much fun as Championship mode and the track selection is really really small."
3,"Sega GT: Lots of potential, not a lot of fun.","Sega GT is great in concept, not so much in execution. There are tons of cars, the graphics are pretty great for it's time, and you even get a mode where you can create your own cars.That said, the game is wonderful until you try to race. The controls are jittery and way too overdramatic. You can barely steer your car around corners using a regular controller. This is all exacerbated by how silly the physics engine is, making your car's suspension act less like shock absorbers and more like a pogo stick at each corner of the car.Add to this tedious menu diving and repetitive race series, and you end up with a game that looks promising on the shelf but is actually pretty crap when placed in a Dreamcast. Points for trying, Sega."
