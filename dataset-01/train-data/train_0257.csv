5,Very Essential,The Jackson 5 were A Great Group.Their Vocals Hit Right On Time with this Material.I Want You Back is Still Unstoppable too this day.Never Can Say Goodbye is Fantastic.The J5 have Soul all Over this Set.A MUST HAVE.
2,Pass this one buy,"Yes the music is classic, there's no arguing that fact. But if your looking to add the Jackson Five to your collection choose aother CD to do it. There are too many hits missing from this collection."
2,Not The Original Arrangements,"These are tunes used by PP&M, but they are not the original arrangements. They are generally simple piano material with guitar chords added. OK as is, but deluxe it's not and anthology is a stretch."
5,The World of Odysseus is a great book!,"The World of Odysseus by M.I. Finley is considered a classic about Bronze Age Greece, and it is. And with an introduction by Bernard Knox is always interesting. Prof. Finley is very such of his evaluations about the Greek Bronze Age and definately so about Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and who might have written it. I am sure that camp about the Greeks and Homer are divided between those who agree and those who don't. I find much in his argument to agree with."
3,Hello?,"Hi i bought this book and since i am a prime customer i was supposed to get this book by last friday but it still didn't come. When i press Track package it says that it is in transit but it had a arrival scan to the city near mine 3days ago,.... can somebody please help me and tell me how to contact the delivery system?"
5,Best shock pump around,Finally a pump that does not lose pressure in the shock when you take it off.
5,Excellent,"The Topeak Pocket Shock DXG Bike Pump is simple, quick, and accurate. I especially like the way it keeps the exact pressure in the fork when you remove the pump. Though it is physically a small pump, it does not take much to add pressure to the fork, which is something I had wondered about when I purchased it. I have nothing bad to say about it. I am glad I purchased this unit."
1,Rubber Tube Busted,"The pump tube busted after two uses. The first time I used this on a Fox Shox, it worked flawlessly. The second time I use this to fine tune my road bike tire pressure, the rubber tube make a loud poping sound and was busted."
3,3 stars with positive explaination!!!,"This was a gift for my nephew, so I really can't personally review it. However, he seems perfectly happy with the pump and it arrived at his home within 3 or days from the order!!! No problems. Sorry I can't say more about the product itself, but I haven't even seen it since he doesn't live near me. But it was exactly what he had requested!"
4,Well Built Pump,I would give it 5 stars if it came with a carrying case. Locks on to the nozzle well and feels very exact. Had a problem with my seal breaking with my previous cheaper pump so definitely worth the extra money.
4,Great shock pump,"I bought this pump to help maintain 3 Cannondale mountain bikes with headshoks. This pump makes it easy to air up the shocks to the recommended pressure, but leaks where the hose attaches to the pump if it isn't held just right."
2,Not Satisfied,"I bought this for my 2011 Recon Gold front fork and it did not work. Had major issues with trying to get air into the fork, needless to say I was disappointed with this product. Perhaps it wasn't designed for my fork or I got a flawed one, I dunno, try you luck if you have the extra money."
1,My pump was extremly poor quality,"After 15 yrs of using shock pumps I recently bought this model. Used it first time on a Fox Float RP-23 and the hose connecting pump and shock did burst in a loud bang. Like fireworks, but right next to your ear. Not funny, potentially dangerous.I usually like to get a lot of bang for the buck, but maybe not with my shock pump. Topeak delivered a lot of bang, and thanks to Amazon I got my bucks back."
3,Not for everyone.,"I've always enjoyed dark comedies, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful... It was just ok. I think I would have enjoyed it more if it didn't have this incredibly annoying and kind of loud soundtrack playing in the background throughout most of the film. It really got on my nerves. Also, the image seemed sort of warped, like a bad widescreen-to-fullscreen conversion."
3,A Good Sourcebook,"A good follow up sourcebook if you have already taken the first steps in the direction of starting your own business. Very up to date, but time sensistive resources."
5,Fantastic,"Marvin Gaye Sounds Great all the way through here.His Voice as the Material is Timeless.Mercy,Mercy Me,Ego Tripping,Too Busy thinking about My Baby&the Rest of The Material Here is First rate Stuff.Very Essential."
5,Blues Original,"Even though I live just down the road from Asie Payton's hometown of Holly Springs, I was not lucky enough to hear him live before he died. After listening to Worried a few times, I know that I will regret that for a long time.Payton's blues are the basic Delta blues that could only come from a lifetime of living what he sang. In the same sense that Willie Foster (Get Live at the Airport)is an important artist and a true original, Payton's music is real, heartfelt, and a tribute to what living in the Delta is all about.Worried Life is powerful stuff. There are not a lot of extra frills, just a man singing from the heart. If you love original American music, make sure to get your copy of this one."
3,nice to see this in paperback (decades later!!),"I somewhat recommend this dated and dry book from the SAIC of the White House Detail during the early part of the 20th Century, Col. Edmund W. Starling. That said, it is nice to see the very old hardcover in paperback....albeit decades later!!Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
2,"Good writing, but...","...the material is nothing that hasn't already been rehashed and re-rehashed by the author on 411mania.com and insidepulse.com. If you already read the author's work on 411, then you've already read the book, since 95% of the material is taken from his PPV recaps. As good as the writing is, the material's already available for free online. Save your money."
2,By the Smark Messiah for Smarks,"The book suffers because it is written for a ""smart"" wrestling audience familiar with the internet. Unfortunately, if you are in this category you're no doubt familiar with SK and his ""rants,"" and the book adds no new information to them.I was looking forward to the new, redone rants but it's more of the same cut and paste jobs, with slightly adjusted star ratings. This is just one big compilation of the past 3 years worth of ""Wrestling Observers."" I was expecting so much more.The content is hardly worth a star, unless you don't regularly frequent the Internet Wrestling Community. In which case, the content will be way over your head anyway. ""You can't win for losing."" The only saving grace is the fact that Keith really is a good writer, and it does flow well."
3,"An improvement , but...","This book is somewhat of a letdown if you are a regular reader of his ""rants"". Mr. Keith *still* seems to have a different style when in the publishing world as compared to his online escapades because much of the humor and wits that he shows in his rants are almost non-existant in this book. As a previous review stated, most of what is in this book he has already stated numerous times online at various websites (but this time without wit). And while it is always enjoyable to hear some HHH-bashing, Mr. Scott Keith makes it the theme of the whole book and it really runs tired and ragged after awhile. HHH hasn't gotten this much face time since this week's episode of Raw! Definitely not worth the $19 price tag, but if you can find it once discounted, it's worth a casual read as it is more focused and a step above his first two books. Overall, a 3-star effort because even if this does seem like a ""copy and paste"" job, the content is worthy of being read about."
3,WWE 1963 - TBA,"Scott Keith isnt everyones ideal voice of wrestling .Many can rightly point to his onesided and often jaded view of the business and claim he'd alway look at the pro wrestling glass as being forever half empty .But personally i like his no frills approch to the subject , even if he does tend to droan on a bit after having made his point .WWF/E wasnt painted in a very good light by Keith and no surprise there , just got to read the title to figure this.Could of done without all his star ratings , but reading his net columns over years it was exspected .Still good to read if read The Death Of WCW"
2,A few good points but an overall disappointment,"I'd heard so many good things about Scott Keith and his writings that I was willing to give him a try. I really hope this was the worst thing he's ever written and that his other 2 books were better, because this one totally blows. Although I did agree with him about: why Triple H is not as good as he used to be; Owen Hart's senseless death; and that Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle (among others) are awesome wrestlers--I strongly disagree with his assessments of Shawn Michaels (who is my favorite wrestler EVER) and other wrestlers too numerous to list here. I agree with another reviewer who said he really needs to get over the Montreal screwjob and realize that Michaels has really changed for the better. You may be seeing this book up for sale from me fairly soon; even my roomie hated it and she's not too fond of Vince McMahon either but said it was a pure hatchet job on some of her favorite wrestlers too. Get a clue, Scott."
1,Unbelievably horrible,This is one of the worst books i've had the displeasure of reading through......Scott Keith is a bitter guy with an extremely negative outlook on everything....his book reflects that and so does all his work regarding professional wrestling...i could only get halfway through this pile of crap before i just had to give it back to my friend...funny part was that he didn't want it back....at least I finally have leverage for my off-balanced table leg....i just had to take the book cover off because I don't want to be reminded of it....it amazes me how someone can be so negative towards a business that has given him so much pleasure over the years.....his writing style is also horrible...just awful....it just has such a condescending manner to it....it's almost like it's unintentionally putting down the reader as well......lame lame book....avoid this if you can....
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"OUTSTANDING, As always Connie Mason out did herself on this one. Worth Reading. As always her books keep the interst of the reader and makes us feel as if we are right there involved first hand. I would recoomend this one as with all of her books. They are 100% the best reading. I enjoyed it totally."
1,The Outlaws: Rafe,"I have not received this item as of July 13, 2011. I would like a refund so I can order from someone else.Thank you"
2,[disappointed],"I bought the processor and this holder came with the machine....It's nice for what it holds, but there is NO room for anything else...and of course if you [have] a FP you are gonna buy more blades. I bought the 5 pack of blades and now have nowhere to put them. ... [with] this holder, I'd actually have to buy THREE more, to accomodate 5 blades, as only 2 blades fit per holder. Kitchenaid needs to design a holder to fit nothing but blades, and I don't mean that ""tree"" looking thing...I want my blades put away, not hanging where they can be a danger (for them being damaged or me!) Guess I'll have my husband build me something to accomodate and protect my blades."
1,Blades didn't fit in case!,I have the 9 cup kitchen aide food processor and the round cutting blades did not fit in the case! It must be for the 7 cup model only. Had to return it and pay for the additional shipping charges. Very dissapointed.
3,Accessory storage box,When I ordered it was supposed to be for my make. But it does not fit my disks. They are too big for the storage box. It was sent in a timely manner and made well.
2,Hard to use but hard to beat,"It is difficult to get the blades in the back out of this case, but it does keep everything organized and dust free."
1,Nonstick coating peeled in 3 month,"The non-stick coating worked really well in the first 3 month but it started to peel and became very sticky. Not for serious chinese stir fry, very disappointed."
1,RE-publication date listed misrepresents item!,THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN 1915!!!! IT IS A HISTORICAL PUBLICATION. DO NOT BUY IT THINKING IT WILL INFORM YOU ABOUT EDUCATION IN DENMARK TODAY!
3,A fun read...,"I read this book about 2 years ago. I was at a crossroads both in a personal relationship and my medical career. It was refreshing to read that another woman in a ethnic minority had faced similar experiences and that the perception of the medical profession being comparable to that of the military profession was basically the same as mine.I admit that it is not exactly as precise on the subject of the journey through medical school and the patient work per se, but it was still a fun read and I would recommend it to people who want to read up on a different perspective of their chosen medical path..."
3,Could have been better,"I wanted to get an in-depth view of a medical student's world. What I got, however, was a sketch of that world. Sayantani DasGupta has a lot of ground to cover and I realize that-- but she skims over way too much. We get brief glimpses of her feelings/thoughts at different stages of her schooling, glimpses of various patients, but we get nothing in depth and this is frustrating. She kept telling us how difficult it is to be a woman, to be in med school, but I wanted to see more examples of this rather than simply be told this over and over again. She clearly has strong feelings about what's wrong with medical schools and the medical community, but that is another book entirely. I wanted to hear more about her experiences and feel like I got the short end of the stick."
2,Defective Magnets?,"My son just received two of these as Christmas presents - Hawkblade and Battle Scorch. On both of them, we were very disappointed to discover that the left arms either would not attach to the shoulder, or in the other case, had a very weak magnetic attraction, and could not support the weight of the entire arm. I will be contacting Megabloks in the morning and hope to get this resolved. It's a huge bummer for my son who wasn't able to fully play with the very first toy he received this holiday season."
2,This box set isnt necessary,"Considering that theyve only released one really good album in the last ten years(a lot of people dont cound the s/t, generation swine didnt sound like motley), and that theyve released ANOTHER greatest hits album and two catalog reissues(the only differenc being the newer ones have a video), I see no reason to get these box sets other than if you dont have the albums."
3,Great Album,This is the type of album which wets your appetite for more Smokey. It has just enough content to let you enjoy the Smokey sound. And the price of the album allows you to enjoy some of Smokeys biggest hits without wrecking your wallet.
5,One that I have always remembered from my childhood,"I went searching for this book and have been delighted to find a copy of the ORIGINAL story (not the horrible Disney adaption...ick!) that I can share with my children. Though this story was second to 'The Forgotten Door' in my estimation, it is a lovely, mystical adventure that takes the reader along a gentle path of discovery. It is probably the best introduction a young reader could have to science fiction, and also introduces the concept of living in balance with nature. I can recommend both this book and 'The Forgotten Door' very highly."
2,So-So- To be read while young or not at all,"Return from Witch Mountain is vastly inferior to Escape to Witch Mountain. It reads like a movie sequel; the characters are less personally rendered and the plot is more grandiose. As an eleven-year-old, I was excited to meet Tia and Tony now that they have refined their skills at Witch Mountain, but even at that young age I recognized that Return lacked the intimate character and plot that made Escape (and The Forgotten Door) so magical. I enjoyed the story somewhat, but it was a letdown as a sequel and now, years later, I have no interest in rereading it, unlike Escape, which I will treasure repeatedly."
3,The Book Is Okay But I Prefer The Movie!,"This book was okay and interesting but I actually preferred the movie that starred Kim Richards as Tia. I saw the movie before I read the book and I loved the movie so that is probbaly why I prefer movie over book. not to say that the book is bad, it's just that I loved the movie so much that I was a little dissapointed that the book was so different."
3,KAB786,"High heat baseball games are really good arcade style games. the game is fun when playing multiplayer than it is with single player.Pros:Fun multiplayer gameGraphics are not that badMusic is decentLots of game modes (Home run derby to 2 on 2 showdown)CheapCons:Repetitive gameplaySingle player is boring and unrealisticAI is easy to beatAnnouncer saying the same thing over and over..Even though this came has really annoying things in it, it still is fun when played with other, and it also is cheaper than other baseball games out their."
4,franchise fanatic,"There's only one word you can describe hh03 is FRANCHISE. The whole game is emphasized on franchise where you draft rookies control a minor leauge system trade for the next young superstar and have players improve through the years. You can LITERALY go through 60,000 YEARS. This game is only for that computer freak that likes solid franchise games because if you want this game just to play games and hit homers your making a bad choice."
2,Ripped Off and Noone at 3DO Cares,"Bugs, bugs, and more bugs. 3DO has chosen not to provide updates to their games but instead re-release nearly the same product. Here's the kicker, they want you to spend another $30.I have had so many problems with the game and have used technical support to it's fullest capacity. Still yet, 3DO can find a way to make their game work on one of the most powerful computer systems available. I have also used their customer support department and requested assistance. They are useless. They don't care if their customers receive a poor product and obviously think that they are the only product available.I will be the first to tell you that the season mode and the statistical tracking is phenomenal but if consistently get booted off of a game without saving what is the point.If you want this product, be prepared to save your game after every 3 innings that you play, or else you'll find yourself playing the game all over again.Disgruntled Consumer"
3,A buy for addicts only.,"June 18, 2002The graphics on this new edition of High Heat areactually less impressive (to me) than those on my2001 version. I suppose they're meant to facilitatemore lifelike game play, but the player motions in2003 (at least on my AMD 500 megahertz machine) areactually quite jerky (in particular, the swings ofbatters). The speed of runners and thrown ballsalso seems highly variable in 2003, and, at times,superhuman.High Heat remains a great game, but if there'ssomebody out there looking to pick up a baseballgame cheap, there are plenty of 2001's out therefor cut down prices. The only improvementsyou'll be losing out on are the complete rostersand some inconsequential detailing."
1,Maybe if I could play it...,"My system too surpasses the requirements, yet the game won't run. How long until EA Sports releases TP 2003? Maybe that one will run."
1,"This is becoming a trend, 3do...","For the past three off-the-shelf versions of High Heat there have been bugs galore.I will name only the first three that come to mind...You can't watch your team play in manager only mode... if you try it will kick you to your desktop after the top half of the first inning.Trying to play Home Run Derby can make your computer hang.Yet again, snafu with transferring seasons from older versions of the game.I'm sure the game itself will be great once it is patched. So do yourself a favor and wait until it is. Even at the low shelf price it's not worth the frustration yet."
3,MADE IN CHINA PLIERS,"A utilitarian, made in China, tool at best! The jaw locking pliers is just another cheap knock off. Don't expect the same quality that you'd find with Vise-Grip brand. Buy USA. PeAcE OuT!"
5,GREAT !!!,The BEST story about Mr. Sinatra I have ever seen. I watched it three or four times the first day I had it.
3,Should have been complete,"One scene is definitely missing from this DVD edition. They had plenty of room to include all the scenes. That's the reason for the 3 stars. Otherwise, it would have definitely been 5 stars."
3,"Not complete , cut scenes","The movie was aired on TV i watched it and loved it. However , when i watched the DVD i know that there were scenes I remember in the movie that were not on the DVD , that was disappointing .What was there was good , but I didn't get the whole movie."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"I thought this to be an excllent first rate movie about the fabulous singer's life. Fine performances by all the actors who also had many physical characteristics of those they portrayed. Phillip Casnoff did a fine job as Sinatra with none of the excesses the part might have encouraged in a lesser actor.I've always like Nina Siemaszko (Mia Farrow) since I first saw her on Showtime's Red Shoe Diaries.It's too bad the film didn't receive more attention from critics. Even though made for TV, it is on par with many Hollwood movies."
4,Good enough to have been a real movie,"I don't know a whole lot about Frank Sinatra, so I don't know how accurate it is. However, I enjoyed this very much. It's a little lengthy (over 4 hours) because it was a made for TV special or movie or something, but it does not drag on. His childhood and early career are told very well. However it speeds up too much at the end, attempting to explain his Kennedy and mafia connections but failing. Its still worth watching if you wanna know about him and what he did."
1,um . .,The didn't bother to let me know that they got my order and the book arrived the next day after i complained that it hadn't arrived yet.
4,glens review,Johny got his gun was a very interesting and pervocative book. thwe main charactor Joe was hit by a shell in wwI. he is left severly handicaped from the blast. The book was basically all in the words of Joe. It is what he is thinking while he is in the hospital. It is disturbing that he can barley tell when he is awake and when he is sleeping. the only way yhat he can tell is from the heat of the sun and the daily visits from the nurse. THis book was good because it helped me cope with my own handicap. It made me relize that someone always has it worse and that life is a fragile thing. I strongly recomend this book.
4,The Power of One,"This book was quite powerful. It made me think about all the people who fought for our country. It made me think about all those men who died for us, and how many lost an arm a leg or just about everything except their minds. Johnny is a guy who never gave up and wants people to know what the war can do to a person. Everyone should read this book. It is not the most exciting, but it makes people think, is war really worth all the lives that are gone."
3,Powerful Literature,"What can I say that hasn't been said before? There is a reason why this book has survived for more than seventy years and reads like it was written yesterday. It's raw and unflinching, fast-paced and angry. Most of the prose is stream of consciousness and I've never seen it used more effectively. However it does get a bit grating toward the end. What makes this book survive the times is that Trumbo never waivers in his humanity. You are constantly reminded of it, which makes Johny that much more horrific. We actually have rock and roll to blame for expanding our minds, because if it was not for Metallica, some may never have heard of this book. A classic that is not for the squeamish."
1,johnny got his gun,"to political on the liberal side, dont like people that are against military. never finished the book. would never recommend book to anyone"
2,One-sided story with a prejudice view,"When reading Johnny Got His Gun the words magnificent and masterpiece never crossed my mind. The author tries to turn people against war and makes them think that nothing good will come out of it.I agree that war is horrible but some times it's the only solution.I don't care for a book that follows a character that just sits there and feels sorry for himself.Students should not be forced to read this book,I mean if this is considered a masterpiece I wonder what they consider garbage."
2,good is not good,"Beware of buying used books. This one was in definitely not good condition. Within a day, the back cover fail off. Buyer beware."
2,You can do better . . .,"This is an 'oh, Kay.' book. Not great, but trying so hard to be great that I place it in the ""Striving-for-Mediocrity"" category. A far more poignant ant-war novel - `Johnny' is a novella at best - would be Ron Kovak's ""Born on the Fourth of July.""The story of Johnny is, nonetheless, one well worth experiencing; the printed word is not, however, the best medium for sharing his experience. The film adaptation is little better, but clips from the film and dialogue from the book are artfully blended in the 1989 music video ""Two of One"" by Metallica.While I usually pooh-pooh film adaptations of literature and am not particularly a fan of heavy metal, this recommendation flies in the face of most, if not all, of my previous reviews; I stand by it!Skip the book, skip the film, buy the music video and share Johnny's nightmare with the audio cranked up as high as you can stand it!"
2,"Lame, weak ending!","Johnny Got His Gun is not something I would suggest to someone to read. Who wants to hear about a guy's memories from his life who is pretty much dead. He also shows no pride in fighting for his country, he should have taken his medal with honor. In the end the author could've at least made up something a little more exciting. I read through a whole book to find out that the world is going to shun him away, even though he was smart enough to learn how to communicate."
2,It wasn't the most interesting book I've read,This book was very hard to follow at the beginning. It got much easier to follow at the end. It was one of the most anti-war books that I've ever read. This book had to many things brought back from Joe's life. Maybe if we have known him better we could have enjoyed it a lot more. Joe's explanation of war was who needed it. So Joe's history was that he had regreted going to war.
3,The Power of Survival,"""Johnny Got his Gun"" is a book that the Junior English class had to read. I think most classes in the U.S. should read a book like ""Johnny Got his Gun."" It shows the pain the soldiers went through. I thought this book sent a very strong message. This book expressed much pain and suffering. It showed how determined people are to save themselves. The book really didn't have a climax and the ending wasn't the best."
3,"Slow moving, hard to get motivated to read","Johnny Got His Gun was a book we read for a high school English Class. The book started off slow and I couldn't tell if this was going to be a book I was going to enjoy or not. As I got to know the character, Joe, I developed sort of a hate for him. I didn't care for his attitude and I don't feel that most soldiers think the way he did. Or at least they shouldn't, they should be proud of what they do. Joe made it seem like he was the only soldier who ever suffered in war. I understand his circumstances are beyond belief, but he should still consider the others. The book had its good points too, it was interesting to read about someone elses thoughts. As a reader you know first hand what Joe is thinking and how he feels. If the book wasn't as slow and had a better ending I think I would of enjoyed it more."
2,"""Johnny Got His Gun"" is a one-sided story.","This book is probably one of the most controversial books I have ever read. If it was not assigned for a class, I probably would not have ever read it. This book brought about a lot of discussion and a lot of arguments. It is difficult to understand how a man in this condition could be able to still live, let alone think rationally. I feel ""Johnny Got His Gun"" brought about a one-sided opinion of war and coming from a man such as Dalton Trumbo, I understand why the book has this view. I thought the stories about his life before the war were interesting but I don't think they were too relevant to the story. It was not written in an organized fashion, therefore a lot of people had trouble following it. I would not have picked this book out for myself to read and I did not really care to read it."
2,"Great Writing, Bad Message","I thought Dalton Trumbo did a fine job of writing, it took a lot of talent to write that book. I also feel that the message that he was trying to portray was horrible. I don't like the way he is so anti-war. I am in no way for war at all, but I also do feel that there are some things that we have to fight for. WW1 was one of those instances. When you are selected to fight you must do it with honor cause you are fighting for your country. Joe was not put into that horrible state for nothing, he was put that way while he was fighting for his country. Dalton Trumbo needs to realize that even though war is such a horrible thing, it is the reason we live the lives that we do. We live lives of freedom. It is to bad that men had to lose their lives doing it, but that is why I honor them every year. On a final note, this is not a book that I would have my students read, I definently would not promote Trumbo's message."
2,Rather read it than write a paper.,I think that this book was wrote bad. I think that the author was unable to think of things that interested people so instead he decided to bash American patorism. The book tried to tell us that war was so bad and that you never get credit for it. He continually cares nothing of the metals that he recieved for his actions. All I have to say is that he should live in Bosnia where you have no choice and you get no credit.
2,A book about a man who felt cheated by war.,This book gave me the impression that the author thought that war shouldn't be fought. His true feelings come out in his main character Johnny who feels that his life was taken away from him by war. I really didn't care for this book. I don't agree with the authors point of view. I feel that he was bias towards war and tried to push that upon his readers. I don't feel that his book gives a true perspective of how all war vets feel!
2,It was hard to get motivated to read the book.,"This book was different than other books that I have read. When he was telling about his past adventures, I was so wrapped up in it, that I forgot what was really wrong with him. The ending kind of dissapointed me because it was there, and then it was over."
2,Not that great.,"I was excited for this book when I got it. After reading the first hundred pages or so the first day I put off finishing it. Why you ask? Nothing ever happens. He lays in the bed and thinks about his life. It is an interesting concept, but I would prefer to take out about two hundred pages of the author's ranting about war. A good short story at best."
2,Agitprop,"Brilliant but primitive agitprop, designed to scare the slack-jawed set. Literary value leaves much to be desired - the book is brutish and straightforward, no trace of irony or any ambivalence whatsoever."
3,Not the greatest,"""Johnny Got His Gun"" can mean different things to different people. I felt that this book was worth the time that we took to read it. It exposed us students to what the war was like. Joe's condition was a little over exagerated but it made me aware that people are not all the same. The beginning was slow and the ending could have been better, but what was all in-between, was decent."
3,"Could have been better, could have been worse.","""Johnny Got His Gun"" is a book written to express the pain and suffering that war inflicts on its soldiers. I think that the message in this book is, don't fight in a war unless you absolutely have to, it is not worth it. Although I feel that Joe Bonham believes this, his thinking is affected by the fact that he was left without arms, legs, and a face. He turns sour and sarcastic to everybody and everything because of his situation. In the beginning, it is almost impossible to not get lost in the memories that Joe recalls. Overall, the book does get better as it goes along, but the ending is disappointing."
2,Johnny Got His Gun wasn't worth it,"I thought the book ""Johnny Got His Gun"" was an okay book but nothing too spectacular. Johnny's attitude toward the war and government in general really disappointed me, though. As a person who's had and has family in the military, I feel that his attitude that we're fighting for things we can't see is biased and one-sided. I am forever in debt to not just my family but many others for fighting for things we can't see. These men and women gave and would give their lives to give others all the things Joe was complaining about. I also feel that his attitude of self-pity was pathetic. Many others have been and will be injured in wars and I hope and have faith that their attitudes won't be like Joe's."
2,"Interesting parts, but mainly BORING.","This book held some interesting parts and views, but as a whole it was extremely BORING. I read this book in senior english and I had to force myself through 90% of it. Anit-War? More like anti-freedom. The character of the book was unbelievably prejuiced against waht many hold dear. Trombo has hit a book that I refuse to recommend to anybody."
4,Johnny Got His Gun: A Teenager's Review,"Before I read Johnny Got His Gun I feel that I really took life for granted. All the little things about life suddenly seemed immensley important. Reading about a man with no physical abilites made me thankful for things I had believed to once hate, such as running the mile in gym or being forced to eat my vegetables at dinner. Occasionally Johnny Got His Gun would become very repeticious. A small noncomplex idea would take the author a entire chapter to describe. However, overall I enjoyed this book very much. Not only did it make me value life but also taught me about the dangers and consequences of war."
2,The Best Book Ever,The book I read was a pretty good book.Some parts werebad because it had caqusing i n it.This book was inter esting.
1,Work of a total hypocrite,"The second review says it all. Trumbo was a pacifisr as long as Hitler and Stalin were buddies. Hitler would have loved this book aa a means of damaging allied morale. An evil, disgusting pice pf wprk."
5,Absolute Masterpiece,"This book should be required reading for every literate human being in the world. Furthermore, it should be read by every government official before sending our armed forces into dangerous territory. This book is so moving you forget it's a work of fiction. This may very well be because it really isn't fiction at all. Stories similar to this are all too familiar throughout history and continue today with the United States involvement in Iraq. This book was originally published in 1939 and the message it sends still falls on deaf ears no matter how loud and clear the message screams. We can only hope that one day the power of this great literary work will reverberate throughout the world."
5,way ahead of its time,"The reviewer who gave this novel one star must have been expecting an action novel, because he missed the point entirely: the novel is about what war can do to the individual. For an American novel of that perios, it was ahead of its time (as far as I can tell), in the sense that it deals with war in a naturalistic and individualistic sense, rather than in a collective sense. After all, when the fighting stops and you return home, you are a person again, not part of a company of soldiers, and the soldier in this novel is the extreme case of someone who must ""come home"" so to speak. If you liked ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" or ""The 13th Valley"", then you'll probably appreciate this novel. It's definitely worth a try."
3,Joe's Hope to Communicate With the Outside World,"Just imagine being without most of your senses. How could someone live that way, but Joe has learned to move on with his life and try to figure out how he could possibly communicate with the outside world. This was an interesting book to see how war could effect someone. It told about many factors of the war. But, on other hand it was really wierd to think that someone could actually live that way which is impossible."
3,I found the book hard to follow at times.,"The misuse of punctuation in the book made it hard to understand at times, but it does give you a true insight as to how his thoughts were running through his head. The way he continued to recall the past brought to truth the realities of what he went through, and the things that he was going to miss out on. He would never see, or hear anyone again. While I will probably never read this book again, I would advise everyone to read it at least once. It makes you realize how unglamorous wars really are."
4,A young man who loses his five sense during the war.,"In the novel Johnny Got His Gun , Dalton Trumbo writes an anti-war novel from the point of view of an injured infantryman (Joe Bonham). It is a story of a young man who loses his arms, legs, and his face after the war and still survives. It was a story where readers develop their imaginations the realities of the survivors of the war. The book uses powerful words that give readers a flood of intense emotions. The book was so terrifying, imagining a man without his five senses and still survive was so horrible. Trumbo's novel was very good and I would definitely recommend it for people who haven't read the book, but the only thing that I didn't like was he jumps around in time and place with his characters."
1,It was BORING,This book was a waste of my time. I did not like the story about the antiwar. I did not like Joe it had to much discription. I want to go to war when I am old enough to know the meaning of death.
1,A depressed author's work,"This book's author displays all the classical signs of major depression. Just like Salinger did in Catcher in the rye and Huxley in A Brave New World. The book deals very little with war itself and how he was injured or what he saw, but does instead talk non-stop and ad nauseam about the soldier's life before he was injured. He describes his father in sad detail and rethinks all the things he should have done and his lost love. Again, classic major depression and NOT an anti-war book."
1,horrible,"I hated this book. It was disturbing reading about things like these, cause it never crossed my mind that war could affect people like this. sure I knew people die and get wounded and stuff, but reading about how it actually happens was too much. I read it once for my English class, and I am never picking it up again."
1,very graphic,"this book is abselutely horrifying.this guy goes to the army and gets blown up............only he lives, well sort of.hes fully dismembered,and is blind,deaf,mute and horribly disfigured.he cant smell either because his face is all blown away.and the entire book is about whats going through this guys head.its f'n sickening.eventualy he begans banging his head in morse code.""kill me kill me kill me kill me......................"".its truly sickening.and whoever that hippie is that wrote it should be locked up because hes demented."
5,"Mezmerising in its sickness, depressing in its truth","Trumbo managed to write a novel, completely ficticious, bases on the WWI, that neither justifies or harbors it. In fact, the novel is a statement against boosting the economy through war, against sending innocent boys to die, against war in general. And the skill and passion with which Trumbo conveys it are equal to Kovac and Vonnegut. The horrifyingly real imagery and internal monologue of Joe, the soldier who becomes fodder for a cannon and has every part of his body cease to function except his mind, bring the reality of a war which was fought with no real reason and no real conscious to life."
4,Johhny Got his Gun or Did He?,"War is no man,s victory. Our country is only open to the victory, glory, and power that war brings. War brings more sorrows than glories. Johnny Got His Gun brings you the circumstances of a man who doesn't make it back to our home soil. This man amung many others never made it back, Joe lived out his life in a hospitol bed never returning to the U.S. and home.Joe the main character was directly hit by a shell, during WWI. Joe barely survived the bombing,laeving him unable to communicate to the outside world.Joe's hardship and inablities to do anything allowed him to live his life through his mind, made me realize the reality of war's reprocussions. After reading this book I really feel for any man who has been through a war.Johhny Got His Gun will hopefully have the same inpact on you. I recommend Johnny Got His Gun to any interested reader."
5,This is one of the best anti-war books ever!,The best thing about the book is it makes so much sense. The point of view of the character is very frustrating. I helps to give you an idea of what it would be like in Joe's shoes. Plus the little stories in the book help to keep it interesting. It is by far one of the best war books of all time because it doesn't center directly on combat but rather on the individual horror that war brings.
5,Definitely Provoked an Emotional Response,"And that emotion was anger. Seething, blustering anger. The book is incredible in style, flow and concept. It has mesmerizing language and a poignant message. But by the end I was frothing with indignation. Painfully realistic through heartbreaking injustice. An incredible novel. (but All Quiet on the Western Front is better)"
5,I hate to read.... BUT I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!,"I first had to read this book for my English III class. I thought that it was going to be torture to have to read a book I didn't even choose! But, once I started reading I couldn't put it down! This book is full of inspiration for everyone. It dosen't take a genius tounderstand the meaning of the book. Anyone can relate to what the main character feels. This is a prime example of how strong our will to live really is. I loved this book and I recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Strong message, but annoying character","I thought this book sent a very strong, one-sided anti-war message that leaves an impression on the reader. Personally I do not agree with the message totally because it is to rash. I don't believe that a soldier would feel the way the character in the book did. I can't imagine being able to live the way he did, but I also can't believe his attitude. He thought the whole world was against him, but he didn't help them much by reacting the way he did and I think something could have been done to the ending to keep it from turning out so weak. Over all, I felt the book left a lasting impression on me even if I didn't totally agree with the message and the character."
4,A decent book with excellent insight.,"I thought that this book was a little extreme in it's opinions, but it served it's purpose as an antiwar book. Joe defied all odds by breaking out of his darkness by communicating with the outside world, the outside world however, pushed him back into his lonely darkness. Trumbo gave detailed and vivid insights into the life of Joe, the main character."
3,Rent the movie first,"The plot behind this story is incredible, however, I found that Trumbo tainted the story with weak writing. In some instances the book almost seemed to be written in the stream of concious style. I found the prolouge to the story far more frightening than the book itself. This book is scary because the plot is believable. I'm sure this novel only begins to break the surface of the hoorors of war. The film version is much more convincing than the novel but I would check out both. I found both the film and novel hard to find until it was re-released by Bantamn books. Also go out on a limb and check out the Metallica home video ""Two of One."" The band made a seriously haunting video composed with chilling clips and movie voice overs intermingled with rehearsal performance. A truly frightening message in a compact format."
4,"Great WWI fiction, but overzealous ending.","This book is some very good WWI fiction. I suggest that anyone who reads this and likes it should read All Quiet on the Western Front. The stories from the front are very vivid, real, and shocking. However, the only thing I did not like was the very end when he started getting self-righteous and preachy. At this point I remembered that Trumbo had never been a soldier and let alone fought in a war. Soldiers do not think like that, I know because I was in the Army. Any of the soldiers I met who were intelligent and unwounded matured after a while and realized that they did not want to fight in a war for any government or politician. A wounded soldier in that state would never feel the way he did toward the end of the book after dealing with everything he had to with that level of cynicism. After having been in, I just couldn't find the attitude believable"
3,Interesting perspective of war.,This book came into my life at an important time. That was 25 years ago. I would like to reread it. At that time I was crippled and not expected to live. This book gave me hope
1,Tannenbaum has given up the ghost,"Like Hoax, a dreadful book. The characters are flat, vapid, and unrecognizable to anyone who has read the earlier books. The writing is simply appalling. The organized campaign would seem to be that of Mr. Tannenbaum, not the much-missed Mr. Gruber."
2,T Bomb,Have been an avid fan of Butch and Maureen but I'm sick of reading filler and old history. The last two books have been real bad about draggin'. Two thirds of the story could have been written by a 70's word processer. He has great potential in this swashbuckling family yet it goes unrealized meted out in two good chapters per book the rest drones on. I'm gonna have to wait for the paperbacks to get the covers ripped off in stead of buying first editiions. I just feel ripped off reading all that cut and paste...
1,Mourning the passing of Butch and Marlene,"I won't bother with a synposis of the ""plot"" in this pale version of the fabulous Butch and Marlene series. As a long time fan of Robert Tanenbaum, the man who was taking credit for these wonderful books, I was flabbergasted to discover he was using a ghostwriter (Michael Gruber). Since they ended their agreement, the last two books have been totally disappointing. I read Fury just to see if the old spark might have returned. . .but no. The writing style is juvenile. . .the prose is flat. . .and the wry humor is gone. The only reason to read this book is to marvel at how truly abominable it is. Rest in peace, Butch and Marlene."
1,What a disapointment,"For the first time, I put down one of Tanenbaum's book without finishing it. I found his characters stereotyped (I wouldn't be surprised if Rev. Sharpton sued) and plot lines absurd. I had a similar but not as strong reaction to Hoax. After reading some of the reviews here, I discovered that he had a co-writer who may have been the heart of his previous books. Too bad Mr. Gruber isn't around anymore."
3,OK but not as good as the others,"I just finished reading this book, and I was disappointed. The plot jumped all over the place, and at times was downright ridiculous. I have been a long time Tanenbaum fan, and I looked forward to each new installment of the Karp/Ciampi saga, but this one left me wondering what went wrong."
2,"To the well, too often","Others have reviewed this book and said Tanenbaum has gone to the well once too often. True, but worse in my judgment, he has slammed the NY Times with ad hominems and without reason. If he wants to write a novel in which the NYT is, reasonably, the villain, ok. But no more Tanenbaum for me."
1,"Complicated, too many characters, not enough journey","More than half of the book was spent introducing a dizzying array of characters with remote connections. The last part of the book read like a mad dash to pull together all of the sub-plots and characters into a single picture. There were allusions throughout of what I can only guess were previous books, but those references only made it more complicated and caused the book to lose whatever sliver of focus it had. Finally, the book was completely ridiculous in some spots (think James Bond) and didn't leave enough mystery to want to keep you going."
2,Not Quite Bad Enough to Be a Trash Classic,"The plotting is nonsensical and racist, the writing hackneyed and often laugh-out-loud clumsy, the bad guys stereotypical. Once upon a time, Tanenbaum had a ghost writer who has evidently given up the Ghost. This book is so bad that I hate myself for reading the whole thing. I've read all the Tanenbaum/ghost writer books but this is definitely the last."
1,Dreadful.,"I'm going to second the motion of the reviewer who wishes he had the time back that he wasted on this novel. There are brief flashes of the old Tannenbaum, but they are brief indeed. The terror plot was laughable. The courtroom drama was non existent, staffed with cartoon characters and deus ex machina device. To say that Tannenbaum has lost 'it' would be an understatement."
1,Racism piled on so thick I couldn't finish,"I was going to count out the racist remarks for the purposes of this review, but quite literally the entire first 19 pages is dedicated to explaining how racist everything is, how racist the black man we are going to be following is, how he uses race to get ahead, how scared white people are of those scary black people, how racist the police are. I can't stomach reading this book. People still think this way? This is sick, I will never touch another of his books."
3,"Brilliantly Written, Stumbles in Credibility","This is my first read of the Butch Karp series. It starts out as an captivating, well-written legal story involving a case about four young rapists aka The Coney Island Four. (A parallel to the Central Park Jogger?) The political and legal intrigue was going along just fine until too many other sub-plots entered the picture. The Islamic bombers, the native American Vietnam vet having visions, the underground people, Butch's daughter's cowboy-quick-draw boyfriend, the former Vietcong guerrilla, the corrupt police, the union boss, the street people, the sleazy defense lawyer, etc. I got lost somewhere along way and kept wondering about the rape case. The voices of Lee Sellar kept me entertained. Though I was still left with that ""what the heck happened?"" kind of feeling about the whole book."
2,just a cheap watch w/ a compass,"i purchased this watch pretty much to save myself from buying one for about double the cost. when i received the watch i found out why:the band is what you would find on a very cheap watch / the box makes reference to being made in germany, however the watch clearly states, ""made in china"" / the directions were poorly translated / and the sealer of the deal for me was that the mode button was very poor - sometimes it would advance two modes ahead on one press, other times it wouldn't advance at all.i'm definitely returning itTAKE CARE!"
2,"Boy scouts, get a real compass","I bought this thing for about $20 plus shipping from Homeland. It has a 12/24 digital display, which is easy to see, it tells yopu what day it is, and that part is easy to read. It has an alarm that has never failed to wake me up, and a light you can press to see what time it is at night.I bought it, however, for a trip to France, as I thought the compass, the light and the alarm would be really useful. The compass, no matter how many times I ""calibrate"" it, by spinning it around clockwise (it recommends 3x) is never accurate, not in Miami, not in Paris and not in the Pyrenees, either.The batteries (it has two) are not the most common, but are readily available, and I had to replace them after one month. Maybe I used that light too much. The compass ceases to display first (it never 'works'), then the face gets dimmer and dimmer and goes blank."
4,Huger Sports Digital Compass Watch,"I recommend this digital watch for its reliablity and I have it over 5 years and I only spent money on 2 battery replacements and one watch band. If you can still find this watch, get it."
3,Squashed Engish muffins!,"Yup, it's real pretty and takes up very little counter space, but we're big consumers of English muffins, and this applinace just can't handle them--they come out squished on the bottom and don't pop out high enough to remove without sticking a fork into the toaster, which of course requires any sane person to unplug the toaster first. The ""not popping high enough"" problem occurs with other items as well, and yes, I used the doohickey that pushes the toast up higher and that still wasn't enough. All told, pretty average performance for a very high-priced product, unless you're in it for the looks alone."
1,Faulty Mechanisim,"We received this toaster as a gift just a little over a year ago. Just like one of the other reviewers, the mechanism that holds the toast down quit working. It's out of warranty now so Kitchen-Aid won't do anything. Kitchen-Aid must have a massive issue with this mechanisim but they apparently are hoping nobody makes a big deal about a ...toaster. Well it is a big deal and I urge everyone who has this problem to call Kitchen-Aid at their service number . How about a recall Kitchen-Aid, not for a safety issue but to take care of your customers?"
1,The worst toaster for the max price!,"Kitchen Aid replaced the first one I bought, because it toasted so unevenly and poorly. The second one was even worse, and even at the highest setting, had to be pushed down a second time to get real toast! They then offered me a ""buy-back"", but I didn't get the paperwork for that. I'm stuck with an expensive toaster that doesn't work. Don't buy this one."
2,Black to White Toast,"While the frozen feature is nice, I think I could have gotten VERY unevenly toasted toast from a much less expensive unit. It has made me rethink acquiring more products from this company for my kitchen."
5,Very nice CD,"This CD is really good. One song in particular I really like is ""Crave"". I would really appreciate it if you could send me the lyrics to this song or give me a website where I could see them. Thank you for your action taken on my request."
5,Sleeper,"This album is another that most people slept on. I actually just found out about it a few months ago. His song, the title track Crave, is featured on The Wood soundtrack. His entire CD is very good. My favorite is Crave (#4), but he also made a commendable attempt at the Shirley Murdock classic As We Lay and Stevie Wonder's All I Do. I was impressed as I'd never heard a man sing As We Lay. All in all, it's a worthwhile purchase."
4,I Craved This 4 So Long......'til 10 Years Later!!!!,"I really enjoy this CD. I just got hip to it earlier this year. I happened to ""find"" it while doing a search for Mr. Dorsey. He caught my eye (and ear) on the Crooklyn soundtrack and I kept awaiting for his debut album to be released. I am so shocked I never heard it before now. Like a few other male artists from the '90's, Dorsey was really slept on. He is a true artist. I luv the title cut.....I have several favorites. It's a worthwhile addition to any R&B collection."
3,Good (for a B movie),This movie is pretty good for a B movie. But I recomend that you rent it not buy it
3,an average action movie,if your looking for great acting and a very deep plot line dont look here if you want noting but action tehn look here. it really isnt that bad considerring its title name but it ahs some pretty nice action scenes it it that make it a worth while watch.
4,Nostalgic,"For those who loved to party in the 80's, this CD is sure to bring back memories of those good old days. There should be more collections similar to this. They're guaranteed to sell."
5,A Collector Item,"This cd sound so wicked you feel as if you are actually in the dancehall, wicked selections,a must have for any dancehall lover."
4,Card Box 4 x 6,This box is perfect for the storing of standard 4 x 6 photo's. With standard tab's from any office Supply you can completely organize all photo's for ease in viewing or retrival.All metal and very sturdy.
3,Use according to instructions!,"I had read a number of negative reviews about this product that had me a little concerned. I bought it anyway. My advice is: follow the instructions that come with the device if you do not want to get your fingers caught on the reamer. When preparing the fruit, be sure to only cut off the tip and do not try to cut the fruit in half. You also need to maintain a firm grasp on the fruit as you are pressing it over the reamer. When I did this, the juicer not only worked well, but I also got a 'fruit cup' from the shell that I was able to fill with ice cream and serve!"
4,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner!,"I'd fallen out of reading short stories but a friend recommended this and it's great. A perfect summer vacation read. Good tales, and it's extra fun trying to guess who'll be the next Orson Scott Card or Douglas Adams. I suspect it'll be Daniel Conover: Don't miss his riff on George W. Bush negotiating secret treaties with rival extra-terrestials!"
2,Save your money.,"A rehash of the original P90X version. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I have done this twice and never pushed play with it since. If you can get it for cheap then maybe take a chance. Just my .02"
2,BOO!,Ok I viewed this workout and was immediately disappointed. TOO slow. TOO short. And looks way TOO easy for an advanced exerciser. If you are advanced I would skip this and purchase other interval workouts by Cathe or Kelly Coffey Meyer or Mindy Mylrea.
1,Terrible...,"KenpoX is one of the worst DVDs in the P90x series. I have P90x and I substitute The Pit Workout by John Hackleman. Guys without martial arts experience should not should be allowed to teach with it. Tony Horton does not know about martial arts. Maybe his buddy Wesley does, but Tony doesn't and it shows."
1,No Kung Fu only Step Aerobics,"Where's the Kung Fu? Even her husband in the back can't even do a simple kick w/o falling over! There is almost no kung fu instruction or practice whatsoever, maybe literally 2 minutes. The rest is basic boring 90s step aerobics."
4,"Nice, but pricey","I do like the overall design: looks nice and functionsas intended. All of the tubes are large and the variousfastening clips (QR clamps) are strong. The base, whenfully extended, is quite large, but this thing is verysturdy even if you have the bike in an awkward position.Once the bike is connected to the arm, you can change itsorientation. Want it upside down and head high? No prob.If you're a ""weight"" person, go for the one with the built-inscale--the PrepStand Pro. If you're not a pro, though, theElite will meet your needs.There are other (cheaper) models of prep stands out there,but Topeak makes a good, quality product. I've used severalof their products, and am quite satisfied with all of them.Also, Amazon ships it for free."
4,Does not fit BMW Z3,"I am sure the product is fine, but it does not fit the Z3 (at least not mine, 2001). If you need one for a z3, get Metra 40-vw10 instead. This one worked perfectly. Maybe I could have figured that out before ordering if I spent more time. Otherwise, I am sure this is a fine product if it fits your car."
2,poor reception,"this fits as it is intended to, but the radio reception is HORRIBLE. i have tried it with two different aftermarket radios and nothing works as good as the factory radio BY FAR.tested with pioneer 4200dvd and alpine cda 9887"
1,Metra 40-EU10,didn't fit the antenna lead from a 1993 BMW 325ISMetra 40-EU10 VW /BMW/Euro Car to Male Motorola Vehicle Antenna Adapter
3,Disappointed,"I wanted to be daring and stylish when I ordered this shoe but i was fooled. This would have been much more stylish with a higher heel and yes, the buckle is that large. Fits true to size but could have been a bit more comfortable. This is only for skirts people!"
4,"Not comfortable, but really darling","These are not the most comfortable shoes I have, but I never fail to get comments on them from anyone who sees them. They are real eye catchers and very fun."
4,Perfect in our RV.,"I was very pleased with this Magazine Rack that I purchased for our RV. It would have been nice tho' if it could have held a few more magazines, but I did know when ordering that it was only approx. 3"" in depth. If you need a magazine rack, it is well made and looks good!"
5,Thank You Rita,"This book came at a time when I really needed it. I was a little disappointed about a guy and really wasn't focused on GOD the way I should have been. This book came the day after I decided to put him out of my life and I needed the release this book gave me. It told me first and foremost, where all my energy and faith should like as a single woman. I could go on and on but I just would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,The best thing I can say about this album...,"Even though it's been in my record collection for many years, I recently listened to it OBSESSIVELY for about a month, every single day. How many albums can provoke that sort of obsession? Every single song is a thriller, a masterpiece. Some songs (particularly Calvary Cross) grew even richer with live-performance development over the years, but that just shows what marvels they were from the start! Other songs, like ""The Great Valerio"" and ""Poor Beggar Girl"", appear so richly performed that there's simply no room left for improvement.Additionally, the balance of Richard's twanging electric guitar, earthy acoustics and mandolins, Linda's dry unaffected alto, and clean, simple production really add weight. The whole thing feels quite natural and timeless.Timeless. Yeah, that's the best thing I can say. Well, that, and it provokes strange obsessions."
5,How in the world did I miss this album?,"I don't exactly recall what albums I was buying in 1974, but this one slipped by me for nearly 40 years until I ""discovered"" it yesterday. I've already played it three times and recommended it to several people...this is a great great album."
5,A classic,Nothing I can say about this recording hasn't been said by thousands of critics or fans of music. There is a reason it is in Rolling Stones top 100 recordings of all time. There is a rumour among critics that if someone does a top list of recordings and this one isn't in it then the list is considered rubbish.
5,An all time favourite album,"Ever since I first bought the vinyl album in the mid 1970s, this has been firmly in my list of favourite albums and remains there to this day. A definite 'Desert Island Disc' except that I'd be hard pressed to choose one track - the album is a complete entity. Song writing, vocal and instrumental performances are all top notch and I love the way the instrumentation is used to such great effect - accordions, concertinas, krummhorns and the brass band on the title track all complementing Richard's brilliant guitar work and Richard and Linda's affecting vocals. Having followed Richard's career fairly closely for near on 40 years now, this is an album I come back to time and again and never tire of it.Now I've got the three bonus track as well!"
2,Disappointment,"I'd hoped to find a balanced, no-nonsense look at the life of Mother Theresa, but this wasn't it. After some 200 pages, my attempts to shake off growing annoyance at the author's cynicism and derision faltered. While I was open to the possibility that Mother Theresa might have had the same human frailties that we all share, I was disappointed that the author couldn't just accept that and move on. Instead, he seems to revel in gleefully attributing the most profane and egotistical motives to the reverend Mother's actions and words, but only rarely supplies any evidence to support his speculations. It seems at times that he is truly perplexed at the subject's motives, and thus failing to understand them, he merely constructs what he thinks should have been the rational approach. In the end, I don't really care what Paul Williams thinks of Mother Theresa...I want to know objective facts. I'll be more than happy to come to my own conclusions."
1,This DVD is not what you would expect,"If you were expecting to see part one of Ric Burns' ""The Way West"" on this DVD, you might be disappointed. I was, because my part one DVD has part two on it instead! Has this happened to anyone else?"
1,Dissappointed,"I was rather disappointed when the seller of this book, ""Owls of the World"" emailed me to tell me she couldn't locate it so had to re-imburse the payment.It was to be a June birthday gift for my grandson. Now I can ony hope I can find another copy for sale in time to give as a gift."
4,engaging story but bad stereotypes,"My daughter enjoys this book, but the gender stereotypes make me cringe. In this book, Mrs. Bird complains and bosses her good-natured husband around so we have the typical nag and hen-pecked husband. For some reason, gender stereotypes sometimes both me more when they are in animal books than when actual people are depicted."
5,An Exciting Search,"The Best Nest is a book by P.D. Eastman. Mr. and Mrs. Bird decide they want a new nest. In their search for a new nest, they run into trouble. After much distress they finely find the perfect nest! I liked this story because the author used vivid, descriptive words like BONG! The pictures also show funny facial expressions. Anyone who likes humor should read this book.By Audrey H."
3,an Absolute Classic!,"This is the book you remember from your childhood! A Classic! Great to read aloud, or great for a beginning reader to read to you."
4,Great Positive Movie!,"Like everyone has already stated in their reviews, this is one of the most positive movies for black comedy as they get, all characters are successful and upscale, and the comedy is still hardcore enough to be funny and not to uptight, so hands down this movie is very good in all aspects.I just wish the quality of black movies were like this one for today, it's a shame that new black movies are reverting back to Amos and Andy."
5,too funny,"This movie its hilarious. This is another classic from Eddie Murphy, one of my all-time favorites along with Coming to America and Harlem Nights."
4,It was good but too profane,I liked Boomerang. I've seen it a number of times. Eddie Murphy is a natural and he played the part of the womanizing Marcus Graham very well. The only thing I didn't care for too much was the constant foul language and raunchy humor. I think the movie would have been better without it.
4,One of my favorites....,"This is one of my favorite movies - I thought it was hilarious. Especially Allan Greer's (sp) father and his mushroom suit! That part always makes me laugh. The only thing I didn't like about it was this imaginary ""black"" world that was created. There was only one white person in the whole movie and of course they had to make that one white person appear to be geeky or stupid. The entire corporation was made up of black people and even walking down the street there were only black people. These days if there was a white film that didn't have any black people at all then there would be a big uproar about it. I think movies like this separate races rather then bring them closer. In black America it is socially acceptable making fun of white people (dancing and speaking), but if it were reversed then WATCH OUT! Anyway, take the black/white separation from the film and it would have been much better. The ending was great too!"
2,Good looks aren't everything,"First of all, this movie has some nice visuals. Interieurs, lights, even the clothes of the cast look like they were made for each other. The appeal is so perfect, it reminds you of a commercial, which unfortunately holds true to the rest of the film as well.The actors so much try to look swell, sophisticated and suave that it seems they forgot they not only portray the clothes and fancy apartments, but actually characters that interact with each other. This keeps them flat and it is not easy to establish a relationship to them, which also lets most of the humoristic points of the story fail.If you really are into watching movie-length commercials an evening with ""9 1/2 weeks"" might be more enjoyable."
5,Eddie's best work,"How can one compare this movie to any other by Eddie Murphy. He was undoubtedly at his best, mixing subtle comedy with fantastic dialogue. He was also surrounded by an all star cast of Halle Berry, Martin, David Alan Grier, and Mike Tyson's ex wife . . . you know . . . what's her name. Even though by today's standards the wardrobe is terrible, you must look at it for it's time period, and Eddie's Hair was great too."
4,enjoyable,Me and my husband enjoyed this movie. It had the humor my husband enjoys and the romance I like. It's nice to find a movie that we can both be happy watching together.
1,Bad Business,"I purchased the movie Boomerang on DVD. And instead of me receiving a disc that was regionally coded for the USA, I recived a disc that was coded to play only in European countries. Again I live on California so why would you sale me something that I couldn't even play in my DVD player. Bad Business is what I call Movie Mars products."
3,this movie really put eddie on da map before he wasn't on it any longer,eddie was a nyc player who could get any girl he wish just like that eddie had two best friends that weren't on da level of getting female like eddie was but they were still very cool in their own way this is da film where it is said that eddie murphy discover chris tucker chris tucker was there for a few scenes but he was funny as he is now as da loud mouth skinny man and halle berry plays her really perfectly she is a normal looking woman even though she still looking extremely pretty while robin givens was da chick every guy drool over joe brown
3,Kinda cheap,You get what you pay for. Lots of plastic; I doubt this unit will last too long. It does seem to work okay now.
2,I wanted to love it and it didn't quite deliver.,"I love space opera and the founding of a new planet, well it doesn't get any better than that.The start was really interesting (if a bit political...but believable). And it really became fascinating when they landed. But it also started to come apart then. And it just didn't work from the middle on really. I thought there were so many more interesting things you could do with the premise. So I was disappointed. Really wanted to love it."
2,Not very good....,"It appears that Steele doesn't know much about biology, ecology, or physics for that matter. Although the book is somewhat entertaining, it's a bit frustrating while reading when Steele failed (pretty bad, I might add) at illustrating the ecology of Coyote. There are a lot of things that do not make sense on Coyote. Granted Coyote is a fictional moon, which has a different ecology than Earth and organisms that we do not see on Earth, but it lacks a diversity of life to support an ecosystem. For example, there aren't enough animals on Coyote to have a food chain. What do the boids feed on? How do they get so big? There aren't intermediate predatory animals? There are other flaws throughout the book and too many to mentioned. Whoever the editor that edited his book didn't do a very good job at catching these flaws."
5,Slow start but worth it,"Coyote starts off slow, then goes to a substory before picking up speed. You can tell that it is the first book of a series in the last chapters. Just who are coming to Coyote? And how will they interact with the people there? This is the start of a very rich and enjoyable series. And one that I would recommed to everyone."
1,Pathetic,"If Mr. Steele's first book had been written this poorly, there would never have been a second book. The premise could have been interesting, the characters could have been engaging, the story could have been worthwhile, but none of these are true!Save your money, avoid this piece of exploitative trash. Mr Steele can do better, and should."
1,"Unless you are a far left liberal, stay away from this book","I only got about fifty pages in this book before I did something I had never in my life done before: I threw this book away. The only reason I gave this book one star is because no lower rating was possible.The last sentence I read in this book ended with ""Patrick J. Buchanan reeducation center."" That was only the last (at the last that I read) of a string of evil right wing name dropping the book is laced with. Of course, since this is a science fiction book, the author can write anything he wants. But the type of totalitarian government he describes in the book has always come from the left of the political spectrum, not the right.I am no fan of people like Buchanan, who is a thinly veiled Anti-Semite, but I don't read books to have politics shoved down my throat. If you are far left you will probably enjoy the authors fantasy world of right wing hate, but if you are not far left I wouldn't waste your time with this book."
1,evil right-wingers afoot!!,I'm getting so sick of authors that write books aimed at alienating more than 50% of the population. Is there anyone writing science fiction today that does not have a preachy left-wing message?
2,"Not what I expected, very dissapointing","I love books about space exploration and colonization, but this book didnt do it for me. First of all, it's a collection of short stories stitched together - which could have worked, but didn't. The author switches tenses in the narration which I find very disturbing.The first part of the book takes place on Earth, adds nothing to the story, and is terribly boring.The rest of the book focus on teenagers rebelling and taking off into the bush - not what I wanted to read about.Another reader says (and i agree) ""If you are looking for a sci-fi book with cool toys and action scenes, stay away. Personally, I'd reclassify this as a western.""Allan Steele can write well, but this story was a real yawner."
5,A very good read,"It is evident that this is less of a novel than a collection of short stories, this however doesn't detract from enjoying the stories. Some of the concepts are standard sci-fi stuff, but presented with unique twists that made it all worthwhile. I have reccomended this to several friends and would make the reccomendation again."
2,Disappointing,"While the author has a engaging writting style, I was disappointed with the story. The book is not really a novel, but more of a collection of shorts around a central theme.The science in this ""sci-fi"" is uninspired and is secondary to the plot.The lack of common sense that would be included in the planning and execution of a space colonization voyage is appalling. The idea that an alien world, only observed by infrared spectrography would be no more hostile than the New England coast is laughable.The best alien creature the author could come up with are terror birds (he calls them Boids).The book is more an attempt to push the authors Progressive/Socialist politics than literature. And even that is amiteurish with him trying to equate libertarianism with one party fascism (its not, look it up)."
2,good idea...bad execution,The concept of the story is not bad....if you ignore the political absurdities...the science is off....but this was obviously meant to be more space opera than Hard SF.....forgivable.The style of writing totally sucked. Moving from present to past tense in various chapters....the style leaves little to be desired. The author needs to find a tense and stay there. It might also help to find one POV and stay there as well instead of jumping from 1st to third person in different sections.I read this book and the next...I probably won't bother to read anymore by this author.
1,Does not work on an xp platform!,Don't get fooled by the great reviews if you have an xp platform! Sims Hot Date does not work on it. It sounded great to me at first but then I relized it required an older platform!!!!!!!!!!!! like wouldn't they update it to run on xp?(DOy)
2,did not work well on my computer,I could only get this game to work 2 times. And i could not play my regular sims game when this is loaded you must play this version. I am a real fan of the sims games but i do not reccomend this version at all. Unless you have a very up to date computer.
4,sims,"I think the sims is a really cool game.you have many thing to choose to do,the same with the livin,largeand house party but to be honest sims hotdate looks the best.since you can let your sims go to restaurants and shops it looks really fun.i always wanted something more exciting for my sims and now its here:).the thing i liked most about the hotdate wasthat your sims can go to different places.thats all:)"
5,Sims new release,"Sims has created another expansion pack but this one would prove the best one yet! Sims hot date is an all new sim experience including new objects, interest, new sims and even a car... your own car! Included in this game is a downtown hangout! A shopping mall, beach (which you can create), park, pub and even a fancy restaurant. Ask that special sim out and take them for a romantic dinner... hey if the mood is right you can play footsie or even gossip about the couple next to you. If that is not your idia of a perfect date take them for a stroll in the park, have a picnic or even make out! Included in the game objects are love coaches, picnic baskets and a love tub. This game proves the be the most exciting one yet. Congratulations Maxi's for creating yet another brilliant game!"
3,Buyer Beware!,"Although I love Hot Date to death, I still must warn potential buyers. If your computer barely meets the requirements, don't buy it or upgrade your computer. Downtown runs so slow that you can eat a meal in real life before your sims even order theirs. Plus, the game ""hnags"", get's stuck, and crashes. My game refuses to work with my other expansion packs and Maxis representatives told me to take it back. So unless you have a high performance pc, way beyond the minimum requirements, think twice."
4,The Adult Sims... and that's it.,"I enjoy the game, and well, I still do. The sad thing is, they canceled most of the few actions they had for Sim Children. I mean, I thought there would be more things, but, the poor children, they do nothing but study, then they can't make anything to eat... nothing.But, well, the Adult Sims get to go downtown, have fun, *yadda yadda yadda* It's all good and fun, but that in itself isn't as great as I'd have thought. I mean, it was kinda *bleh*. Anywhoo... I'm looking forward to Sims Vacation.I just think Maxis should think about the Sim Children, because I don't even want to adopt babies anymore."
5,Sims Hot Date,I loved this game. It is funner than the Sims Livin Large and House Party. I would advise anyone looking for a fun game to buy this GREAT game!
4,Enticing Cover,"Not only does this game look ten times as interesting as the other expansion packs, but I have to say (reluctantly), it looks incredibly sleazy. I thought the other two EP's were skanky, with the ""love"" bed and the cake dancer; but despite the seducingly enticing cover and reviews, this looks like the best EP yet! I gave it 4 stars (I have no doubt that it deserves five) just to leave room for one more. So my advice is to buy it while you can so you don't have to wait for any store to restock this anticipated Sims expansion pack. Besides, has Maxis actually produced any unsuccessful games? I think not, Sim fans!"
5,S-U-P-E-R !!,"'The Sims : Hot date' has lots of new features, that means mor fun to play. You can finally get in to the city! I have bean waiting 4 that. But, with 'The Sims Online' i taught it was there. I had heard about TSHD, bot i did not now if it was treu. So now i don't have to wait 'till 2002, when TSO comes out, bot only 'till Fall 2001!! I am so exited, and i can't wait to buy it! As with 'The Sims : House Party', i went the first day to the shop to get it! I didn't order it at Amazon, 'cause i live in Belgum, it's more convinient to go to the shop. If you do not have 'The Sims', BUY IT!! It's the best game EVER! I have all the expansion packs, and they make it even more fun. If you have TS, then i really recommend to buy one (or all) of the expansion packs. I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!"
2,Not what you'd expect,"When I would read the previews for the game I guess you could say I got...""ginny"". But when I made the stupid decision buying the game I relised everything is slow and even locks up your computer on occasion. Now, I have 124mb of ram and a pentium 4 proccesser. I can't imagine someone with the minimum requirements for this game trying to get it going. Of course any expansion pack for the Sims wouldn't be horrible to own but its not worth the price they put on it. I'm not really sure die-hard Sims fans will really get a huge kick out of this game either. The only decent part of the expansion pack is the extended buying mode. But remmember thats also in house party (not as big a selection but you see where I'm going with this). I know I sound like a fool but people save your money, wait for sims online or something. Your best bet for now would to buy house party."
3,This is not a message board.,"Hello to all, I gave this game 3 stars, because it hasn't even come out yet. Yes, I was addicted to The Sims and I'm sure this Expansion will be the best yet. Do you have to have House Party and Livin' Large to run it? That's my question...Otherwise, I'd just like to remind you people that this is a Review Section, not a Message Board. So, stick to reviewing a game that has been played, not anticipating this one.Janae"
4,Maxis has done it again!,"This is the best SIMS expansion pack yet. It is so much fun to go out on dates with people. There are way more actions for you to do and lots of new features. It is packed with tons of new objects and people. This is the best SIMS game ever! I promise you will love it! The downtown area you can crete your self or leave it how it comes. There is lots of new stores restraunts, casual and formal. There are waiters, paino players, any thing you can imagine! I lvoe this game and I'm sure you will too."
3,I don't like the friendship bar.,"The game is ok, but the only thing I really don't like about it is that the friendship bar goes down very quickly and you really cannot enjoy having a relationship with other sims without the friendship bar going down. With the other Sims games, the bar only goes down after the end of the second day, that makes even more sense than this Hot Date game. Even when you meet other people you can't call or see them again. So all in all, it's boring if you ask me."
3,Okay!!,"The Hot Date Expansion Pack isn't a must. It depends on what you're looking for. Hot Date gives you the option to go Downtown. And it, most importantly, gives your Sims a new place to go. You're able to build your own shops and beaches. So it really depends on what you like, and want to do. As all expansions packs, this one takes up a good amount of room. So be prepared. I give the expansion pack a three because it's nice but not a necessity."
5,Awesome Third Expansion!!,"Even if you aren;t the most romantic kid on the block, you'll love Maxis's third expansion pack for ""The Sims"": Hot Date. Not only does this pack add new skins (faces and outfits), objects, (such as the heart-shaped hot-tub), and wall/floor coverings, it also adds the all new ""Downtown"" area and dozens of new interactions (such as Suave kiss, Jump-Into-Arms hug, and Check Out). Downtown is a great new place because it now allows your Sims to go out to dinner, shop for new clothes, and meet new people. Also, if that isn't enough to do, you can add to the compilation of Downtown lots already given to you with the game by creating your own. Add a mall, restaurant, whatever you can think up to entertain those interseting little creatures, the Sims. After you have purchased The Sims, Livin Large, and House Party, purchase Hot Date. It will add a little romance to your Sims' sad lives."
5,"Hot Date Two Thumbs way, way UP!",This game looks and sounds so cool! I recommend you get it! With all the new content and the Down Town feature I don't why you would not wan't this game. A must for sim fans!!
2,This game looks totally asome!!!!,"This game looks so cool!!! The other expansion packs looked really bad because they just gave you new items and stuff. This one is cool because you get this downtown area where there are shops and restraunts. You can get a date and go downtown. You can buy them cool things and the more you buy the closer you get to them kissing you goodby! There are over 30 new types of interactions, 125 new items, the downtown area, and tons of other stuff. By the way I give this game 5+ stars. I gave it two so I could find my review. I pre ordered mine off amazon so I Know for sure that I'll get it on time because I don't want to have to wait for stores to get this back in stock. If you are new to the sims and you want this game you have to buy the origanal ""The Sims"" or the game won't run on your computer. You don't need to get the liv'n large and house party expansion packs, but it makes it much more fun. I highly recomend this game and I hope I have helped you."
5,Ausume!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love it you can do everything go downtown go on dates you can buy roses for your sims date it's ausume I LOVE IT go buy it;s wourth your money if you hate it your pretty damn stupid!!!!!!!!
4,Can't find love,"In the original Sims, getting married was as simple as talking a long time, complimenting, and then making sure they were comfortable and well-fed. Now my sims cannot convince another to marry them. It's so annoying! I am taking hot date off my computer to see if I can remember how easy it used to be. It's fun but so hard and complex. It depends on how much time you have to play with this game (averages between 4 and 24 hours for me, just kidding, but it is addictive)."
5,adds fun elements to game,"This Sims expansion adds the dating element, which is fun. Also added several decor items. I love it, you will too."
2,EH 2...maybe 3 Stars,"The new objects are pretty good. However, this expansion pack runs a bit slow and ""going downtown"" gets to be rather boring."
5,True simmers will especially appreciate this addition!,"FINALLY! All of us simmers have been waiting for the chance to play with a family AWAY from the home! The houses are great, but sometimes a Sim needs a change of scenery :) That's where the downtown comes in. You can change the stores, decide what should be sold, and basically do whatever you want! My only wish would be that it would give more empty lots for development. Other than that, it's great!"
5,I obviously haven't got this game yet but it's gonna be grea,"I gurentee this game is gonna be a winner. I'm hoping to get a copy from my older brother since he's a computer freak and he ca get one early. But all of the sims games are so addictive. One thing this game may have which may be inappropriate for younger children is that there may be well...sex. I heard the exspansion livin' large had that and well this one is all about love. I can't wait till this game is out, I bet it's gonna rock!"
5,HoTTeR ThAn hOT,"Hot date is sure to keep you looking for more!!!! There is the cuddle couch a love bath and an entire downtown area! If your sims have any social skills this is the game for them! Make your sim a party animal, and have fun with the blond bomshell or the jock, at the beach the resturant, store and countless other places!! There are many more interactions between people and the handshake is a major plus! You can primp yourself and show off!! Go out on a date or just roam around town-- it is up to you! Hot Date is more than anyone could have ever expected from the masterminds at maxis!"
3,UPS and Downs,Ups: Finnaly getting out of the house.Metting New People you did not create.Buy new things in downtown areaDowns: it takes way to long to order food.
2,Disappointed by all the hype,"Bought this for my wife, she was disappointed at best because of the limitations that no one ever mentions. Things like you can only control one sim while downtown and it seems to be extremely buggy even with the latest patch, sims and townies both get stuck and sims sometimes seem to ""ignore"" anything you tell them to do. It also requires a pretty hefty cpu and graphics card compared to the stock Sims game and other add on packs. It did seem to ""settle down"" after she played it for a while, but is much slower when downtown than when at home. If The Sims barely runs on your machine, Hot Date will completely kill your machine!The machine she plays this one is only about 6 months old a Sony VAIO FXA36, a 1 Ghz processor with 128 MB of ram and an ATI Rage Mobility graphics chip. I can upgrade the RAM to 256 and that might help."
2,FRUSTRATION IN SIM CITY ----,"The game promises and delivers everything you ever wanted to do with your Sim, IF you can live with ""Frozen Screen"",""Game Crash"", ""Freeze Game"", ""Music Skip"" and a million other bugs that I am sure that Maxis found quiet acceptable before shipping. This game would be their best yet if they would only patch it up. As for any sound problems: after installing this in 7 different computers and having the same problems, I have found that the sound problems are indeed, yet another bug that can and do slow the game down. This is in new machines and old alike. All Direct X intact and drivers upgraded. If you run it with only an installation of The Sims and none of the other Sims extension packs, you will run easier but will remain somewhat buggy. I expected more from Maxis. This game needed debugged before shipping."
1,The worst of all,When my sims goes to downtown she just stands there all day. Doesn't move or goes to talk to anybody. I have to tell the sim to do everything. Waste of money and very slow.
5,Love the sims!!,I am like obsessed with the sims!!lol.. i own the sims and the two expansion packs and eventhough i did not buy hot date yet I will!!I can not wait for it to come out....I know it WONT be a disappointment!
4,Sims Expansion-Hot Date,From what has been described I think the expansion pack sounds pretty cool. I always wanted there to be a town or something besides just the house.
1,Bad,"I thought this game was really bad.I got this game for my 11 year old daughter at christmas. the rating says 13 years old and older, but I thought they normaly over rate computer games and my daughter had The sims, so I didn't think it would be that much worst. When I saw what was in the game I stopped my daughter playing it. There was a love bed [that was very rude], there was a a love swing and a picnic basket that they kiss on. There was to much Love and kissing. I Think the game should be for teenages 15 years and older, not 13 years and older.I would like to say to parents with children under 15, DON'T GET THIS GAME!"
3,Just say no to Downtown,"This expansion is worth it for the new interactions and items more than for downtown. I found ""going downtown"" to be a stressful and unsuccessful trip for my sims most of the time. However, it does open up new avenues for gathering SIMfriends, so that you can climb that SIMcareer ladder."
2,nah,"As much as I love the Sims collection, I've noticed it takes about five minutes longer for it to load with each expansion pack. After buying Vacation, I couldn't play it at all, it took so long. And there aren't many games on my computer, either.I recommend this for patient people, because I just can't be bothered to wait that long for this game."
1,I know my games and this bites!!,"I have to admit it was addicting for like 5 days!!! But than it got boring! Well it does have some cool things like you can build malls, restaurants and other cool things, but than like any other sim game it got very boring, ever day is the same. To get to the mall it takes forever! Also it still has that annoying music when you are building, I feel like I want to go to sleep. If I could give it 0 stars I would!"
4,Sim-tastic,"I found this game very good, I only rated it 4 star because of the play downtown slow. The sims when you ask out on a date say no when the friendship is 80-100!Still a good game"
5,Get this game!,"The new expansion pack will let you take any of your crazy friends downtown to the park the beach even the store! All under your command. You create a downtown and control one sim.There you can pick up someone to go on a date or use a phone to plan a date! Here there will be rewards, such as cuddling and making out. The objectsive of the game is to keep your date going as long as possible! Take hime or her to the store to get some 'sleepwear'.It's going to be another expansion for your sims to go crazy!"
1,"I thought it would be worth it, but its not","This game is entertaining for the first three days, and then the appeal wears off. It takes a plethora of tedious and miniscule tasks to get one major thing accomplished. Buying this game would be the worst waste of money ever.Although there is 125 new items, you need to build al lthe buildings and areas, and it takes too long to enjoy. Heed this warning and do not buy this game."
5,The best game expansion pack ever!!!,"The Sims: Hot Date is without a doubt the best game expansion pack ever. Some people say that The Sims: Vacation is a better than hot date but they are wrong. First of all there are 125 new items on Hot date. Only 77 items on Vacation. There are many Pros and Cons about this game._________________________________________________________________Pros1.Alot of new items/objects. There are new floors, windows, wallpapers, doors, trees, lights, tables and counters. There's even a lighted ceiling fan.2.You get to create a whole different world(Downtown).3.Get to expand the sims social life. Alot of the sims atitude depends on social activity.Cons1.Takes a long time to load.2.It could have more features._________________________________________________________________This is a must buy expansion pack!"
4,Wanting to Play!!,I brought the game over 6 months ago along with 5 others. I played the other games and love them. I went to download Hot Date and guess what I couldn't because I don't have the game it needs to porceed. Please help and e-mail me back with the infomation needed to get my game downloaded.. My e-mail is rrosario@safespacenyc.org. I would really be greatful.. Thank you.
5,Its Aewsome,Maxis has done it again! Sims Hot Date is their best game yet! Its just hard to explain its so good!
3,"Love the Sims, but maybe this is ahead of its time?","I was quick to purchase this expansion pack because I have really enjoyed the The Sims and Living Large, but I am less impressed with their newest expansion pack.As the other reviewer said - it is slow, slow, slow. We actually had to uninstall it on our current Sims computer and reinstall it on our faster computer (thus losing all of our other characters to the new game) just to get it to run reasonably well. Even with the faster system - it still hesitates alot. I think they made the Downtown area a little too bustling!But, it does have some cool new items (mostly walls and floors) and an enhancement to the relationship meter that will make the game more challenging.I would say, if you have a top of the line system - buy it. Otherwise wait a year until things improve."
1,Not Fun,"I love the Sims. Whenit first came out, i played it all day every day. With every expansion I would get back into the game again, but not this one. I only played it for about 3 hours and I was done. It takes FOREVER for things to load and its so chopy and I have a good computer. It takes up a lot of space. The other problem is that they think its so great to have a few new furnishing and floors and wallpapers, but you can download practically anything you want from the internet. The internet is just like millions of expansions packs. You can download anything. This expansion sure didnt get me hooked."
3,"i expect it'll be worth while, but...","of course, i dont already have this game, but i DO have the sims, livin' large and house party. while hot date sounds cool, i think they ought to stop churning out every little idea that comes to mind. also, the whole idea of the town, tho it sounds like fun, proabaly is really draining on the PC. and i bet it's not as great as they say it is. i'll buy it, and i'm sure others will too, but it's just an expansion pack. maxis should work on the sims 2 or simsonline instead of making (what's the count now? 3?) a lot of expansion packs. you know they'll make another. and another, and another..."
3,Sims,"It was a great extra to add. It only makes the whole game a little too ""loving"" it starts to get annoying.I had a bunch of sims like my friends and family, and while my character was in town, next door I saw my moms character and my friends character kissing! I screamed and ripped the power cable out!Not for the younger peeps!"
4,Its an awsome game!!But there are some problems,"Well first of all let me say this is much better then living large and house party, But it makes things like getting married a lot harder to do! It takes forever to get friends and even longer to eat at a restraunt! What i mean is the downtown is fun but it takes so long to build it you dont even have time to actually play and when you do its hard to get them to do things but its a very fun game if youv got the time!"
5,A great expansion!,"This expansion has a lot of great new features, but does have some ups and downs. Some of the good things are the whole new downtown area. You get to buy new clothes, buy gifts for others, or even go out on a date with someone you either know or make friends with a person in town. There are a whole bunch of new items sorted into different categories (for example, in the lights, they are sorted into wall lights, floor lamps, etc.). There are a whole bunch of new interactions. When you kiss or hug someone, you can choose what kind of kiss or hug you want. That goes with just talking with them and other things.This game does have a few downs to it. The game requires a lot of CPU power for the downtown area, since there are a lot of people and movement. In my opinion, it is harder to make friends, since you have daily and lifetime relationship bars instead of just having one. Despite these things, it is a great addition to The Sims."
5,Great stuff for those liking the singles,"This is an unusually huge expansion pack for any game, and Sims into the Singles scene will not be disappointed. Though less interesting for Sims fans who are more into married life and careers, as always the expansion contains goodies for everyone. It is well worth the price, and at the price that Amazon.com currently has it at, it is a steal."
2,"Would like to give 5 stars, but....","I would really love to give this game a 5 star review, but there are too many bugs in this game if you are running Windows 2000. I was able to run The Sims, The Sims Living Large and The Sims House Party with NO PROBLEM while running Windows 2000, and all Hot Date ever does is crash right when I'm starting to have fun. Until Maxis releases a patch to fix this game, do not bother buying it if you are running Windows 2000.PS - if you don't believe me about all the problems with this game, feel free to visit thesims.com website and check out the message boards/BBS - there are a ton of posts about people having problems with this game, and there are also posts from people who love it."
1,Disappointing,"Although this expansion gives the availability of just calling and partially keeping a relationship alive, the amount of time to build and keep any type of relationship inhibits the availability of advancement in job promotions.Our family is nuts about the origional and house party, but this one has dissolved that interest and hot date sits unused. We will uninstall this expansion so that we can get back to enjoying this game and hope for a better expansion in the future."
4,Strong and fun...how expansions should be done,"The newest expansion for the revolutionary game The Sims doubles your fun by finally allowing your characters to go out into the world and interact with people or go on dates in downtown locales such as restaurants, nightclubs, clothing stores and the beach. You can build stores as well, but they give you just about everything you need right off the bat, so you're pretty much left with building weird looking stuff that already exists.The installation (once it stopped crashing) also gives you more options for interaction (you can kiss fiery, nicely, peck, etc.) and you can improve a sim's interests in something by reading magazines, increasing their chances with more people they come in contact with. great stuff, and, like the expansions before it, totally necessary and right on time."
4,Another Great Expansion to a Already Great Game,"This is a great addition to your game. While past expansions have simply offered new objects, jobs and skins. Hot Date takes it up a notch by introducing a whole new enviroment. Now instead of mearly sitting around the house, your sims can now roam around downtown to their hearts content. This also adds a multitude of new social interactions such as leap into arms, or snuggle together at the couch as opposed of the traditional five hugs in a row to get those relationship points up. The only evident downside is that with the new interactions it now gets harder for your sims to get to the level of marriage. However that is only a minor detail, and only requires a little bit of work to surpass. Overall a great game."
1,No,This is the worst game ever. There is almost no gameplay and it takes hours of working up to your date to get 1 kiss. Dont buy it.
5,Fantastic,"The Sims was an excellent game, but one problem was that you could never get your Sims to travel anywhere outside their house whilst still controlling them. Hotdate does two things which make it a fantastic expansion pack:1. It gives the opportunity to combine the gameplay or The Sims with earlier Sim games like SimCity by creating other environments than their house for them to interact in.2. It's always fun to get a little love interest going, and this makes it even easier, more realistic and fun.It's a perfect companion to the original game and it's expansion packs. I always hoped we'd have to opportunity to take our Sims elsewhere, and now we can, making the game even more appealing."
4,Sims Hot Date Expansion pack,This latest edition to my library made the gaming experience more complete and enjoyable
2,Right plan bad execution,I like the premise of Hot Date but the game is too slow and sometime causes the computer to freeze. A patch is definitely necessary. Can't blame Maxis becuz the thought was in the right place. Just wish the game was better
4,Sims Hot Date Review - By Susan,"My daughter loves any sims game. Over the monthes that I've been watching her play, I've been hooked no watching her. I recomend this game for 9 and up.{If you don't want your child watching romantic kisses then they shouldn't play or watch this game} From the animated people's view there's lots of kissing, huging, and pasion for the other anamated person. {Don't worry people in this game can not be, or get gay it's not that unepropet I may add.} My daughters also fight on who gets to play it. I should probally mention that after you get the game going, you can take it out and put it in another computer so that another person can play at the same time, and get this it doesn't mess up the game when you do this, which I think is very cool. So have fun playing this very interesting game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
5,I'm getting this game the day it comes out...,"I've had The Sims scince February 2000, Livin' Large scince August 2000, and House Party scince July 2001. I can't wait to add this game to my collection!"
1,JUST THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY,Dont you people see what they are doing? Why couldn't they add this stuff in the last 2 expansion packs? They are putting out an expansion every 6 months just for your cash. SO far the Sims cost you $100.00. I wouldn't pay that much for any game !! Why dont they just offer this as a free patch??
2,Disappointed,"I have been a big fan of the sims and when I heard of another expansion well excited doesn't cover it.So I max out a charge card and ordered it from one of greatest stores online,Amazon.com.In short the objects are outstanding but you have to tell your sims where to go and what to do the free will play is gone no more sitting back and watching.If your a control freak then this expansion is for you."
3,5E12 rubbermaid hose hook,strong hook and it seems like we should get years of good service from this product
3,Worthless,"This thing is pretty worthless. I got mine free with my GBA. All it holds is the GBA, 4 games and mabey a gamelink cable if you really pack it in. The strap suchs and looks BAD. Only buy this if you don't plan on getting much for your GBA. I'm getting a bigger one for $15.00. It is a much better deal."
1,"oh boy, this ...","this case is one of the worst cases i have ever got. it does hold your GBA (duuuuuuuh) and it can hold a few games but it cant hold really any items except maby a worm light but then you really cant hold any games.its the same thing as the zip around (it can come of the shoulder holster)except the zip around has a slitly bigger pocket for the GBA (which really doesnt make difference). you should probably by the other GBA case that ... has,its cheaper and better."
1,IT'S HORRIBLE!!!!!!,It's a waste of money. The shoulder strap isn't very comfortable. It's also kinda weird looking when you wear it. The zip-around case is much better. ... You can also hook the zip-around to your belt or something else. The zip-around is much better. I have the shoulder holster and i only use the case that comes off.
1,"In my opinion AWFUL, but it really depends on who you are","In my opinion this case is AWFUL! The case only holds 2 games at the most, and my GBA. It is really bad, and for 14 bucks! I don't think so. The place where you store your games and GBA in, and games, is onlt like 7"" tall, and 4"" wide. But If you aren't a big GBA fan with only a few games, no accesories really, and just need something to hold your things in, this proboly is for you."
1,Don't Get It!!!,I got this for free @ Toys R Us and it just stinks. The shoulder holster will never fit no matter how well you adjust it. The zip around isn't half as good as the single one which you can buy separately because thye material is very soft and doesn't protect the GBA. The zipper always gets stuck. The single zip aroung which is cheaper is also better quality. Don't waste your money on this.(Even though you probably got it for free. ) Any carrying case is better. There's no point taking the chance of ruining your brand new GBA TRUST ME!!! I have this piece of junk!!!
1,$15!?,I also got this free from Toysrus and I know this isn't worth $15. maybe $5. All it is one of those zip-around things attached to a strap. Their are one pockets on each side of the holder to hold games and accessories. You cant fit many accessories inside and maybe three games.
2,This is a waste,"I bought this along with my GBA the day it came out. This is the same thing as the zip around case, but with a shoulder strap. It holds about six games if they are packed neatly and a GBA. It doesn't hold anything else. The zip around case is a waste of money, but paying five extra dollars for a shoulder strap is even more of a waste. I am almost six feet tall and it barely fits around me. Don't get this if you are big or planning to buy more than six games."
4,The Best Game Case Ever,I really think this shoulder holster is a great idea for Gameboy Advance because now you don't have to worry about leaving the usual case without straps somewhere and forgeting about it.
1,"Nothing to see here folks, move it along.....","Do not spend any of your hard earned cash on this. Even though I got it for free, I find it barely useful. Problems, oh yeah. First, it doesn't seem like it was actually designed for the GBA. Also, you are NEVER, repeat, NEVER going to wear this as a shoulder holster. The GBA fits inside sort of and I can almost fit a worm light in the case with the GBA. Almost! You can put a couple of games in a little mesh pocket insde with the GBA but when you open the case, WHOOPS, the pocket doesn't hold the games secure and they just fell out of the case. Hope you noticed. Tip for others, that game you lost, check under the seat in the car. I cannot possibly convey what a disappointing product this case has been. It works only slightly better than the bubble wrap envelope that my GBA shipped in."
4,love them,I love these shoes. Very comfortable. I put them on almost every day when I arrive at work.One drawback would be that they're not very comfortable to drive it.
4,As described and expected.,"The longer ones that are included do fit into your ear a little deeper to prevent background noise which is nice. Otherwise, exactly as expected."
5,Awesome toothbrush,"I've been using a professional model Roto-Dent brush for a few years, but lately have been using mostly manual brushes. Went to the store to replace my old Oral-B manual brush, and saw this Power model for only about two dollars more. Wow! The difference is amazing. Crisp and clean. I bought another for my wife, and she loves it too."
2,"Pinches my lips, is painful.","My Oral B CrossAction was good for a while... and then it seems that manufacturing of the brush head went down in quality. The brush head started coming loose and move up and down as the brush was spinning. This pinched and hurt my lips.Sure, it is inexpensive, and it probably is a good product for the price... but in that case, I would opt for the Oral B D-4 toothbrush."
5,Better the expected,"They sent me the newer edition of the book, the book reads as used in the details but when i got it, it looked almost new. I'm very happy with this product. ^_^"
2,Almost complete waste of money,"The English in this book is so poorly translated it makes this book practically useless. There is nothing in it about sentence syntax and uses unknown terms. (Like 'habitual' tense)Some ok phrases.. not worth a a second look, let alone a first one."
5,One of the best Christmas gifts!,"My hubby bought this for me for Christmas this year. I thought this was one gadget that I'd never use. Well was I wrong! I have used it quite a few times since and each time I like it more! We have small children so I always worried about them choking on food, well I throw the food into this baby and I don't have to worry anymore. I love all of the attachments and the storage case the processor came with. This is a great investment piece that will be around FOREVER!"
2,KITCHENAID KFP650 DISCONTINUED,"Whatever you do, do not buy this food processor. This was a -really nice- food processor. I enjoyed using it very much since the day my wife bought it for me. It had a strong motor, was easy to clean up, and had lots of useful accessories.Within the last 6 mos., the work bowl broke. They are no longer made or supported by Kitchenaid and I have waited 2 mos. for 1800parts.com to find the replacement part. All to no avail.Despite how wonderfully made this product was, it will be useless to you if you are unable to replace basic parts which make it function. My advice to you: buy a current model food processor that has a higher likelihood of continued parts and service availability.Good luck!"
3,Wattage incorrect,"Another reviewer suggested that the advertised wattage was incorrect. He/she was right. This model only has 650 watts. I called kitchenaid to verify. In order to post this note, I was required to rate the product but I don't own it. Garbage in, garbage out."
4,Could be better,"Although I am thrilled with all my kitchen Aid appliances. I have three. This is one has given me some trouble. I owned mine for two years and here's what I think. The plastic bowls don't stand up to the everyday wear and tear. I had to stop putting them in the top rack of my dishwasher because the plastic started getting dingy and lost its transparency (let's be honest, we need to simplify our lives, isn't that why we bought it in the first place). The locking mechanism loosened and you had to wiggle the bowl locked. The shredder cannot handle shredding large amounts of food. For example, when shredding motzerella the shaft becomes very hot and starts to skip.(if you have one shred the motz by hand) For the price you pay you only get one cutting disk that slices very thin, you have to spend another [$$$] for a better grater/slicer. On the up and up the little bowl is a plus if you puree baby food, garlic, etc. and the control pad is easy to clean. I couldn't get along with out it."
1,Item has been discontinued and no accessories available,"The bowl lid on my 11 cup KitchenAid unit broke and I am unable to find this accessory for purchase. Everything else about this unit works fine but the machine cannot be used because there is no source for replacing the lid. In fact, according to KitchenAid there are NO accessories of any kind for this unit available. I am truly disappointed in KitchenAid because they have not made provision for this eventuallity; therefore, I WILL NOT purchase KitchenAid products again. Bottom line, this means It will be necessary for me to purchase a new food processor because the lid of the bowl broke and KitchenAid has none in stock and I was told everything about the 11 cup processor has been discontinued. Very disappointing to say the least."

3,70's top forty...,"70's top forty with Mungo Jerry, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Dobie Gray, Nils Lofgren, Gladys Knight, Dave Mason, R. Dean Taylor, Hamilton Joe Frank & Reynolds, and four songs by Three Dog Night."
1,Where's 'Bury Me' by Amy Millan & Grindig?!?,"Actually 0 stars, 'cuz the one song I wanted, 'Bury Me' by Amy Millan & Grundig... Not Here! So frustrating. I feel so cheated. I don't need to hear any more Three Effing Dog Night."
4,More than a buddy film - a 'bromance' with a woman.,"This film is a lovely surprise. It is much more than a buddy film. A ""bromance"" with a woman.Andrei Konchalovsky is a director worth watching. He adds a humanism to his works. On the other hand he has some old Russian stuff you may not like, but his American works are worthy pieces of quality movie making.You get to love these characters. I want to see more of his English language films. I was entertained.This film features Whoopie and Jim in an odd-ball relationship. It is is so well acted, you forget all the other films you've seen with these actors. They are perfect for each other.This is not a comedy is the strict sense. It is touching and full. Worth the ride -- a ride in Whoppie's beat up old car."
3,No comedy that,"I saw this when it was first out, and I was shocked that it was billed as a comedy (like Nicolas Cage's The Weather Man also was last year), when it was nothing at all like a comedy. In fact it was a quite depressing movie. I suspect that those responsible for writing movie posters just don't bother to actually watch the movie, and just guess on the genre, based on the starring actors."
1,Review of What I Didn't Expect,"An inferior and pretentious editing in a lot of the stories that were previously good fairy tales, myths, etc. Was expecting something more intriguing and sophisticated for the children of today's world."
5,Fabulous moral stories...the best compilation I've found so far...,"As a homeschool mother I am always looking for great stories for my almost 7 yo and my 2.5 yo. This book is part of the curriculum for Sonlight and it is fabulous. My daughter's favorite is about two brothers, one who doesn't let his ""please"" out of his mouth so the ""please"" jumps into the other brothers' mouth (which makes him say all his ""pleases"" twice). Eventually though, the ""please-less"" mouth wants his please back and his ""please"" is thrilled to be at home and allowed to get some fresh air. The stories are grouped by moral or attribute (compassion, courage, etc.). Both male and female main characters throughout the stories and the poems makes this book appropriate for both boys and girls. I highly, highly recommend this book, no qualms about it."
5,"It's About The Message, Not The Messenger","These tales were collected from virtually every corner of the globe and some go far back into the reaches of antiquity. Bennett and his collaborators did a fine job of finding stories of universal, fairly non-controversial appeal that we can all cite without worrying about the inherent differences in religion or politics that might otherwise divide us. Segregated according to the principles being celebrated (Honesty, Courage, etc.) these fables and true life stories demonstrate virtues of conduct far too often left unstressed in our morally-undermined society."
1,Pages loose,"Know by price, problems but expect to be told when pages are falling out because binding broken. Won't use again."
4,Perfect fit earbuds,"I know the CX300s are great earbuds. My problem has always been the fit of the earpieces to maximize sound quality. In search of replacement earbuds I came across these. $2 sounded like a deal. The only problem was the $5 shipping, which to my understanding, is not the seller's fault. The earbuds came within a few days in a plain envelope with a couple stamps on it.Inside were just the two black rubber earpieces. No case, instructions, nothing (but that wasn't a big deal).Upon trying these babies out with the CX300, I'm pleased to say that this is a great product for those looking for. Getting the pieces to fit snugly wasn't a struggle whatsoever. The bass is deeper than what the standard earpieces gave, however a tad bit of high end is lost, but the perfect fit still makes it worth it.I recommend making this quick tiny investment in order to brings loads of improved listening pleasure to your current in-ear headphones."
5,A must-have for every serious dog owner!,"Fabulous book!! It is packed with information, but easy to understand and apply. I found the book to be very balanced and subjective in it's approach and advice. For example, it fairly presents the pros/cons of different diet approaches, without specifically recommending a ""one size fits all"" solution. All chapters of the book are valuable, but the section on diet and nutrition is particularly outstanding! Since reading the book, I have adopted a diet of home-cooked meals for my german-shepherd-mutt that is virtually 100% vegetarian! Seeing the way she responded to the new diet has converted many of my friends into believers who were total skeptics of a vegetarian diet. Although my dog was always healthy and happy, the changes are unbelievable in terms of her temperament, appearance and personality.Regardless of whether you're looking to change your dog's diet (as I did), this is a valuable book and must-have for every serious dog owner!"
2,"Weak characters, weak ending","Many of the characters in the novel, Suspicion, seem to exist only because the author wants to side track the reader. There is no real need for some of them and the sub plots they are involved in are not really necessary to the main story. The personalities of the main characters don't really ""grab"" the reader. There is no feeling of really liking or really disliking them. They just exist. The plot seems weak because the basic reason for the story is flawed. The buildup to the climax is pretty good, but the actual end is a real letdown. Actually, there is no real definitive end to this story. If you like a story that doesn't leave you hanging at the end, don't read this one. I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who liked it, but I was very disappointed."
1,Only if you are desperate!,Basically it passes time. You can definately put the book down because you won't care what happens to characters.. The one thing I don't think any of the other reviewers have complained about is the horrible paragraphs about technical mathematics. If it is not Soccor it's linear equations.. is this fiction or a text?
3,Lighter than air,"This so-called ghost story sounded really enticing on the surface, but it remained a superficial read from start to finish. The characters are all cliches, and the plot is as obvious as Mrs. Hysop's purple marking pen. In fact, I think I liked the ghost better than anyone else in this novel, with the exception of the dog.Sure, there is a ghost, but I would not call this a ghost story. The ghost is peripheral to the real story, which is how a woman's past comes back to haunt her. As someone in a previous review pointed out, the main character is a shallow yuppie who evokes little or no sympathy in the reader.And what makes it worse is that Rogan is a skillful writer with some degree of talent, but she'd put it to better use by developing some meaty characters."
3,Interesting,"A solid read; kept my interest. A bit cliched in bits, but overall the end result is good."
2,Cliched and predictable,"I love mysteries and ghost stories. But genre fiction doesn't have to mean poor quality. This book is one of the silliest compendiums of cliched characters, predictable plot, and derivations from B movies that I've ever read. I had the flu and needed light reading, and I'll grant that this is a mindless page turner, so the book has its uses, I guess. If your mind's fully functioning, though, read Minette Walters or Thomas Cook for spooky psychological thrillers, Edith Wharton or M.R. James for ghosts--not this nonsense."
3,A for Suspense; A Fun Read,"This book is very suspenseful, I'll admit that much. Mary Higgins Clark, too, can write suspense. It's not easy! But beyond the suspense, which I admit kept me reading well into the wee hours, everything else in this book is flawed. The main character is eminently dislikeable. The first 50 pages should be chopped off. The one black woman in the book (a teacher and artist) speaks in a dialect I think is supposed to be ""black English."" Other characters are flat or cloying. And in the end, a lot of loose ends are left dangling. Frankly, this book suffers in comparison to another newly-released (and BRILLIANT) novel involving the supernatural, Ann Arensberg's ""Incubus."" But, ultimately, none of this matters because we keep reading and chewing our fingernails. This book will make excellent beach fare this summer."
2,Boring!,"I so enjoyed 'The Shore of Women' and had high hopes of a good read with 'Child of Venus'. No such luck. I did manage to finish it, although I found myself skipping and skimming much of it. Just plain boring. Never got into any real action at all, much of it was simple rambling and thoughts on paper. Maybe if I had read the first two in the trilogy, but even then I just don't think this book works well. I just can not recommend it. Try something by Sheri S. Tepper instead--or read 'The Shore of Women'."
5,Suspend your disbelief (and amusement)...,"...long enough to get through the first chapter.Only an adult reader can grasp the entirety of this book. It touches on politics, mysticism, ecology, and the Darwinian struggle to survive. This would be an amazing enough book if its characters were humans. That Adams can make it work from rabbits' point of view is nothing short of incredible. If you give it a chance, it will entertain the most serious reader."
3,"Unique, but drawn out","Overall I did find this story to be very unique with its substitution of rabbits, instead of people, for characters. I can easily see why people would call it the ""Odyssey"" of rabbits. However, I found it to be a bit drawn out and while I very much appreciate a descriptive author, I felt Adams at times was closer to writing something akin to ""Walden"" than anything else.It's a bit too adult for children, though it is certainly not above them. I just felt the story could have been a little more succinct. Overall, I give the story 3 1/2 stars as it did have some wonderfully suspenseful moments. Though I found flaws in this novel (which, judging by previous reviews, is not a popular opinion) I do give it an A for originality."
3,Watership Down,"Richard Adams' classic novel, set in Hampshire, England, is worth reading for memorable characters and a decent adventure story. The protagonists of the novel prevail through their fidelity to their true natures, while the villains fail because they have sacrificed their freedom to their desire for security.The novel offers the reader some insight into real rabbit behavior, which, according to the front matter, the author gained from R.M. Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit. To me, the best scenes were quiet ones, with the rabbits snug underground or outside feeding on grass under moonlight.The only parts of the novel that didn't work for were the stories and legends that the rabbits tell one another about the mythical figures of Frith and El-ahrairah. After the second one, I stopped reading them and stuck to the main plot."
4,A Notable Book,"""Watership Down"" was brought to my attention by a friend, once I finished the ""Redwall"" series (by Brian Jaques, fantastic books). The way each rabbit had a specific and carefully portrayed personality had me hook, line, and sinker. I found myself identifying with them. I even caught myself once, saying, ""Wow. I'm a lot like this rabbit."" A very satisfying read for those who want to find the rabbit in them."
5,A good book with its own ups and downs!,Listen it's a book that has to be read for me and my friends becuase of our teachers. But if it weren't for them we wouldn't read it because it is very long and has microscopic print. Thanks to our teachers for making us read it! It's a book that can be good or bad--depends on the reader! Suspense and loyalty are very common throughout the book and help make it very good but Adams is a very confusing writer as well--in my opinion but the lapine glossary helps extremely!
4,QUESTION,"I'm just wondering if the cover shown in this picture is the cover you actually get when you purchase the book. (The cove is a up close shot of a brown bunny with ""Watership Down"" in the lower right quadrant) Please email me a answercanadian_chickyy@yahoo.com"
5,Great Book,"I bought this book for my grandson who is home schooled. I read it so we could talk about it and I'd be able to ""grade"" his book report. It's a great book. The story reflects so many aspects of human life."
5,Great creation!,I decided to read this book after listening epic band Fall of Efrafa. It changed my life i think. Highly recommended!
5,WATERSHIP DOWN,"Well written, imaginative, good adventure. In writing about rabbits you soon see the author bringing out the parallel to humans. Writers are always comparing people to wolves or lions or other predatory mammals. As Adams points out in this adventure tale, we are much more like rabbits. Brave rabbits, but still rabbits. Which, when you consider how ill equipped we are by Nature to defend ourselves (except with our minds), the rabbit comparison is much more apt.Adams does a good job and I can see why this book is becoming a classic.GvG"
1,BORRRING!,"Like many others, I was FORCED to read it for English class. I got to page 7 and stopped because it was torture. and I didn't get it why not make a story about humans not silly talking bunnies. And read stephen king or micheal chriton instead, I read this book to page 7 and nothing was happening. I HATE THIS BOOK!"
1,disappointed,"I was REALLY looking forward to this one. When I was a kid a friend of my mom's gave her a copy of this book. I remember wanting to read it because I respected the friend giving the book. Then Sawyer was Boone's reading copy on LOST. That gave it more weight. ""Obviously, this is a fantastic piece of literature,"" I thought. Sadly, I did not find that to be the case. There must be something wrong with me for not liking it. Maybe I expected too much. I was hoping for something a kin to Animal Farm, which this book is not. I'm very disappointed."
1,A big let-down,"I am a teenager and I read the whole book, I found it a total let down. So many people had said that it was a wonderful book. However I found it increadible boring and confusing. The author made up words so that you couldn't follow what the rabbits were saying, the only nice thing that I can say about it is the irony of the book and the little action that is in it. Also the rabbits are incredibly stupid, it isn't until they get to there destination before they figure out that they are a bucks and that they need to mate to keep their warren going. I would advise anyone to not buy this book."
1,"bunnies talk, walk, sleep, eat, and die.","bunnies talk, walk, sleep, eat, and die. Wow...uh huh....that sounds fun. COME ON!!!!! IT WAS BORING!!!!! If an author's going to write about wars and society, use humans, not bunnies (!?) next time. And by the ways, who the hell keeps tallies of how many times they've read a book? It's so obvious it's fabricated."
1,Can you say Pointless?,"Stupid, and pointless. I read it last year for school, and I understood it, but really, why is it required high school liturature? Its one of the dumbest books ive ever read."
1,Watership DOwn,"ok i really hated this book, i had to read it for summer reading and it took me the whole summer to get into it. it was way too long and had so much extra stuff with no point at all except that rabbits moved to a different place and got scared by the stupidest things. only read it if you are forced to or like rabbits way to much ."
4,Good Read,"Entertaining and light reading. Was skeptical of bunnies at first but caved after prodding from my sister. Plus I figured after balrogs, evles, and all powerful rings I could give this a shot. Finished easily in an afternoon, and I would recommend skipping over the detailed nature sections to streamline a little."
3,"AN INTERESTING READ, BUT NOT GREAT","I have to say that I was disappointed when I finally read this book. It wasn't required reading at my high school so I never had the chance to read it. I finally broke down and got it from the local library because it is considered a ""classic"". Now I'm not saying it wasn't an interesting book, but it's not something I'd ever read again and it didn't keep me thinking after I had put the book down. A really great book keeps me involved long after I've finished it. Then I have to read it again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good suspense or action book. It dragged along at times."
2,I was writing better when I was five.,"Why is everyone so obsessed with this book? Let's see, it's nearly five hundred pages and covers the quest of - I lost count- some rabbits hoping to establish a new warren. Okay, sounds bearable, right? It takes 120 pages just to get to that point. They go through all these trials and tribulations while setting up and getting situated, on and on and on. By the time I reached the end, (it took some serious self-motivation,) I felt confused. After all the hype, all the wonderful things everyone says, this book is a sham. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they had read every other book in the world and were desperate for reading material. (like me) This is the most dissappointing book I think I've ever read."
2,Nothing so Great about this book,"People nowadays use the words 'masterpiece' and 'classic' maybe a little too much. There are only a few fiction books I really love among all the ones I have read; this is not one of them.People have said ther is suspense in this book, but bewarned its only at the very verye end. In the beginning I was almost put to sleep by the rabbits and their endless journeys. I enjoy intellectually mature books- even long descriptive books (e.g. Tolkien, Les Miserables)- but I couldn't get myself involved in this story to much of any degree. It just required too much energy to stay focused on this book because it didn't offer up anything interesting. The rabbits just kept going from place to place to place looking for a warren.If you have to read this for summer reading, be prepared for a long mundane tale. otherwise, just skip it."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"My family found this book for me at a yard sale for 10 cents. they all told me it was a great book, even my mom, who rarely reads anything but Black Stallion books and Romance novels. I tried to read it, but I just couldnt stomach it, the plot seemed ok, but I couldnt get into it. From what I read.. the bunnies were talking to eachother, which is fine with me, I can deal with that, but I just couldnt get into it."
2,I really tried to like it; gave up at page 300,"I am not the type of person to give up. If I pay my money, I want to get my money's worth. This book is really boring, but since there was no bad language or sex, I didn't have any excuse for not trying to get through it. After about 6 months of forcing myself to read it, after page 300 I finally decided to skim it. Then I skipped to the epilogue.Everyone else loves this book. Maybe there is something wrong with me."
3,it was ok,"this book was different. it was wierd that it was about rabbits. it did have many different layers and metaphores that gave it a deeper meaning, along with characters that were very skillfully developed, but the fact that it was about rabbits was hard for me to get past. if it wasnt about rabbits i might have enjoyed it more. i personally didn't like it too much but if you can get past the fact that its about rabbits than it really is a good story."
2,"Alas, I couldn't get into it.","Cute as rabbits are, my mother is in a constant battle with the little buggers over her flower garden. Perhaps it was why I could not remain neutral while reading this story. I just couldn't see the vermin as protagonists. They're rabbits, for heaven's sake, not a band of warriors nor a nomadic tribe in the Amazon jungle! The plot plodded and the dialogue was excruciating. My mother nearly had to shoot me to put me out of my misery as I forced my eyes to scan page by page, constantly reminding myself that this was a children's literature classic and a Carnegie medal winner.I welcome anyone to lecture me on the merits of this book."
5,I love this book!,"I really enjoyed this book. It is about a band of rabbits escaping from their old home. The leader of the rabbits is called Hazel. I expecially enjoyed the part when they stole does from Efrafa. Bigwig had to do some serious planning and pretending to be a trustworthy officer in Efrafa. I really like this book. You should buy it, or at least read it. I am only 12 years old but I still love this book."
4,Moving,"A book that you will cherish all the days of your life. I'm 29 and I read the book first in Junior high. Today I saw the cover and once again I entered a world that is full of struggle, sorrow, friendship and hope. The memories are that vivid! A must read if you can read."
5,The best ever!,I have read this book 3 times over the past 6 six years and I never tire of the timeless story. It is a classic that has a lot to say about life and how we should handle different situations. I think every parent and child should read it. I definately plan to read it to my kids. It is just wonderful!
5,A wonderfull reading!,Watership Down is a wonderfull book that keeps you turning the pages. If you want a good book to read that grips you and dosn't want to let go this book is a great choice. Wonderfull for the young or old or young at heart. I have never looked at my rabbits the same since.
5,Modern Classic,"At the age of 9, this was the first novel I ever read, and as a result it became the yardstick by which I judge all other novels. Simply put, it is side by side with ""Gone With the Wind"" as my all time favorite. I have never since read a more vividly imagined work than this world of rabbits in the English countryside. Straightforward Hazel, brash Bigwig and frail but visionary Fiver lead their ragtag band of outcast rabbits from their doomed home warren through an unbelievable series of situations and adventures. The blood in this book did not bother me even in the third grade, as it was not gratuitous or meant to shock, but rather to illustrate that the rabbit, a creature that we all tend to view as cuddly, is a part of the sometimes violent world of nature. Life is hard for even the cutest, most appealing of animals in the wild, whose every moment is taken up with struggle for survival. I doubt that anyone who has read ""Watership Down"" has ever looked at rabbits the same again."
5,Best ever!,"I have to admit, when my husband gave me this book for Christmas a few years ago, I thought, ""Great. A book about rabbits. Let me get right on that."" Luckily, with extra holiday time, I started the book...and was barley able to put it down. This is one of those few books that I've encountered where the farther I got into the book, the more conflicted I became--I wanted to keep reading, but was getting distressed that I'd soon be done! This is one of my all-time favorites."
5,Read it Once a Year without fail.,"I love Watership Down. It's not just a story about rabbits - it's a peek at humanity and society at it's best and worst, simply from a four legged point of view. I read an average of 5 books a month and yet I make it a point to read this book at least once a year. After all these years, I still find myself looking forward to visiting with Fiver, Hazel and Bigwig. I recently took two books with me for a 12 hour flight to Greece - a new one and Watership Down. It was Watership that I read. If I were lost on a desert island and could have only one book with me, this would be the one."
4,Watership Down,"Reviewers before me, both professional and amateur, here on Amazon and elsewhere have written with greater eloquence than mine the original and majestic brilliance of this book. I will just mention that the allegory of rabbits in exile is very relevant today. A wonderful read for all ages!Adams equals and perhaps exceeds George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"", Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book"", Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows"", and E.B. White's ""Charlotte's Web"" in the animal genre of fiction. He even locates the story in a real enough place, the downs of Berkshire."
3,So so book,"I admit, going into this book I thought it was going to be terrible. It was not my favorite book, but it was kind of entertaining. It is not the kind of book I would usually read, so it broadened my horizons.I did almost fall asleep a couple of times, and I didn't really have a drive to read it(English assignment). I thought the whole plot got really predictable towards the end. I also thought it to be bland with no real variety in sentences. So overall, if your into this variety of books, you will probably like it, but if you are a literal thinker, you will probably find it boring and silly."
5,Everything you want is all in one book !,I think this book was really great! My 7th grade math teacher recomended it to me. Thanks to him I have discovered another wonderful classic. I think Fiver was the most suspenseful character. What ever he predicted always made you wonder if it was going to come true or not. It made you want to keep turning the pages. This book also teaches you about the outside life. I think after you read this book it seems like you want to meet a rabbit in real life. And sort of get to know him. If you have not read this book read it its the best!
2,Simple book for simple minds,"Watership Down is a plain and simple texted book. I didn't find any challenges in this fiction, which makes me question the motives of educators and why this book in particular is pushed so roughly towards readers at schools. There wasn't much conflict-i.e. action- except for the fact that the bunnies were the problems themselves...Animal Farm by George Orwell was much more of a challenge and a couldn't-put-it-down book. Oh well, fiction has always been going downward in the sense of working the minds, this one is an example of a simple work for the simple minds out there."
1,Boring and monotonous,"The only reason I read this at all was that it was assigned to me as a student. Other reviewers have pointed out that some books are better appreciated by an older rather than younger audience, but I can't imagine that being the case with this book. It was boring, monotonous, and devoid of any action whatsoever. A large slab of the book if I remember rightly, was devoted to descriptions of defecation.I can't imagine that I would appreciate it any better as an adult, and I will not be wasting my time trying to find out."
3,Watership Down,This book is about a bunch of rabbits trying to save the destruction of their homes. It also talks about how the destruction of an animal's habitat hurts society. It talks about how society is impacted by the destruction of nature.I would this book because I believe nature and animals shouldn't be disturbed or destroyed. Too many houses are being built and the animals have no where to go.
2,"For a book so highly esteemed, very boring","I've been forced to read this book for English class. Honestly, I liked some of the characters and their development was good, but the plot of this book was horrible. It was so boring, especially hearing about how plants look in the moonlight or rabbits ""passing hraka"" (hraka in ""lapine"" - another annoying feature- means ""droppings""). I found the ""El-Arairah"" stories that were completely irrelevant to the main characters interesting and exciting. However, almost the rest of the book was ridiculously boring. If you plan on reading it, read a page a day for the next year and a half, that's the only way to stomach it."
2,So-So,"This is a book that my Gifted English class had to read and, as usual, over analyze. We read it over a long period of time with many tests, etc. and I was pretty disappointed. I know that with a story about talking bunnies you shouldn't expect too much but there was something telling me that this book may be a little bit more...I was wrong though. Blah Blah Blah is about all that I saw on the pages after about a week and eventually I just wanted to put the book down and begin stomping on it. I guess that in it's entirety it wasn't all that horrible but I have to ask myself if it was truly worth my time to read it and I am not sure what I would say. It has a lot to say but it could have been said in a much more condensed version. To be honest I could have cut at least a hundred pages from it and still been able to get the same message across. I guess that in the end I would have to say that if you really want to read this, go check it out at you local library."
2,A completely forgettable book.,"We read this book for an Honors English class this summer, and were not impressed. It was interesting to read Adam's idea of what warren life might be like, but this book is definately not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Reading 100 pages about how the rabbits ""silflay"" is not my idea of a good time. And what's with these funky names: Hyzenthlay, Bigwig, Chervil, and Thethuthinang? And do we really need to know about how they pass ""hraka""?"
2,It's a bunnies world afterall,"The odd thing is I didn't find this book so extraordinary that it deserves 5 full stars (so many people over rate books) nor was it so horrendous to get 1 star (so many people don't know how to READ). Watership Down is a middling book, nothing worth dwelling on when the book ends. It faded from my thoughts quickly."
5,It Will Always Have A Place On My Bookshelf,"I must first praise Richard Adams for the complete originality of this book. Adams introduces you to the rabbit culture telling you of their stories and the way in which they live. When a rabbit warren is in danger some flee to find a new home and other wait for impending doom. I have read this book twice in my lifetime and it still amazes me, it gives you the feeling of courage. You can tell by reading this book Adams has done his homework on the lives of wild animals. When our teacher first told us of this book I thought I would hate it. With no humans in the book (or only briefly mentioned) I thought it would be hard to relate to the characters(the rabbits). Adams does a fine job of bringing rabbits up to our level."
5,This is the best book I've ever read!,"The story was suspenseful,a cliff-hanger. The plot was very well-written. I loved this book and I know you will,too!"
4,Corkin',"All you clever people looking for meaning and stuff in this children's classic, i ask you why?? To make yourself feel good is the answer. I loved this book cos it was sincere and genuine and Meester PeegVeeg should ahve been the Chief Rabbit shouldn't he?"
4,A fable of epic scope (and size!),"Taking Aesop's premise of talking animal tales with a moral and displaying it in a book of epic lenght, Richard Adams delivers endearing characters and a far-reaching adventure in Watership Down. This book is strong in characterization, giving each rabbit distinct traits and personalities, all very human. And you will probably empathize with these rabbits in their quest for a safe haven, just as I did.There are some faults, though: the rabbits constantly switch between using Lapine (rabbit language) words and plain English ones, which withholds you from enjoying the new lexicon Adams had came up with. And be forewarned: in some segments, Adams indulges in lenghthy descriptions, breaking the rythm he had stablished to his prose."
4,"Good story, but drags on.","I had to read this book for seventh grade English class, and I think that is a very good book with interesting plot and character development, but sometimes there are long lulls where nothing really happens (for example when the rabbits are starting the warren on Watership Down). Also, the story dragged on and on. When I thought that it might (finally) end, Adams came up with another plot twist and started off on another great long adventure.To all you who say that it's unrealistic because the rabbits talk, consider this: IT'S FANTASY! If you want a novel with people, go read Tom Clancy, but I think that these rabbits make for very good characters."
3,"Good, but not Great","This book, long as it is, is a good read for those who enjoy animal personifications in a metaphorical sense, however, I personally, did not enjoy it. The plot, though well developed, took many chapters to reach a climax.. so many chapters that interest was lost. A book for some, but not for everyone/"
5,It was exceptional,"This book should be read by all, the way he personifies the rabbits is grand, along with the ups and downs surrounding this novel. I don't really see any real reason that many would hate this book. The way he gives them a religion and the stories flows so nicely from start to end. It really changes your perspective on many things. I thought it was a great read and everyone would enjoy it."
4,High School Required Reading (A Rare Find),"I was required to read this book for high school English. I assumed that I would hate it, though I loved to read. A really long book about rabbits? I thought, ""You've got to be kidding.""Anyway, I just loved the book and it was one time that I actually kept up with (and even got ahead of) my homework.This book is a classic fantasy. It tells the story of a band of rabbits (from their perspective) that need to find a new home because theirs is being destroyed by humans for land development.You grow to love the characters and truly care about their plight."
5,My all-time favorite,"How could anyone not love this book? If you honor creative genius, this is the book for you. Admittedly, I first loved this book because I had a huge crush on my English teacher, but I've read it so many times since high school, I think the worth of the book stands on its own merit. If great writing stands on creativity and character (which I hope to always believe, pardon the split infinitive), then this book deserves pride of place in any well-read person's library. It is one of my desert island indispensibles, and after many years of great reads, it remains a favorite. Lovers of the written word, read this book!"
4,I disagree,"I disagree with the review first that was given, the one that said ""what teenager wouldn't cringe at reading a 400+ book about talking rabbits"" My friends and I are, unfortunatley, the ""popular group"" ( don't judge my,you don't know me, I am not a snob, I am a good person)and we all loved the book! My english teacher was so surprised that I finshed the book before anyone else, it wa cool. You should definatley read this book, don't even listen to that review, this is a great book and ,being a teenager myself, trust teens don't cringe at the fact of a long book about talking rabbits."
3,This book is very lllllonnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg!!!!,I would not suggest this book to kids under the age of nine. This is a very long book and has extremely advanced vocabulary. The beginning is kind of boring and chapter 18 is the first actual exciting chapter. The last five chapters of the book are very exciting. I highly reccomend this to adults or teenagers who like very very very descriptive novels.
5,Watersip Down,"I advise everyone to read this book, it's a wonderful tale of adventure. Many times I stayed up till eleven or twelve at night reading it. Though its sort of slow at the begining it will only get better and better as you read more. This is a story about a band of rabbits fleaing there warren from (at the time)an unkown danger to find a new, safe home. The rabbits encounter problems on their journey that they must overcome to survive. Eventually they find a beautiful, safe home. They are in peace until they realize they are missing a key point in their warrens survival, and as they discover a soloution it will lead them to a danger that could be worse than any other they have ran into before. This is a great book, all the rabbits in this story carry distince personalities that help make this book so exciting to read."
5,Just a bunch of talking rabbits? Yeah right!,"""Oh great, a book about rabbts,"" is the first thing I thought when my 9th grade English teacher handed this book out last year. Even after reading the first couple chapters, I wasn't convinced the novel would interest me- but it turned out to be one of my favorites. As a group of rabbits travels through a forest to seek a new warren, at the deranged advice of one of the younger rabbits, Fiver, Richard Adams explores some of the world's political systems at the time in the different warrens. Some of the lovable characters they meet along the way, such as Kehaar, a Black-headed Gull, keep humor in the sometimes dark novel. You'll most likely have to read this book in school, but if you never had to, I really recommend you buy it. It sure ain't just a bunch of rabbits to this Texan!"
1,Terrible!!!!!,"I had to read this book for my 9th grade english class, and i hated every minute of it. I found it boring and tedious. I would have liked it better if Adams had used people instead of rabbits."
1,long and boring,This was the most boring book I have ever read. This is only for intence animal lovers who have no life. It's long and all about talking rabbits using words only an english professor would know. Read this when you are at least 27 and often bored and have a lot of time.
1,Horrible,"I was forced to read this for english class. I think this is the worst book ever. The author goes into so much detail its boring. The rabbits can go for 3-4 chapters just walking, while the battles are a paragraph long!I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE!"
1,The worst book i have ever read!,"I really did not enjoy Watership Down. As a student in juinor high school it was very boring to read. I did not want to read a book about rabbits and their problems. The book did not match my interests, so it made me dislike it even more. If i didnt have to do a project on it, i would not have finished reading the book."
1,Watershipdown,The book turned out to be in a deplorable state than what it was advertised by the seller. It felt very deceiving to say the least. I just want to warn other buyers to not be fooled by the seller's good reviews even though I doubt that will be the case any longer.
3,"OK, THIS BOOK ISN'T ETERNAL LITERATURE, but IT'S NOT TRIPE","For all the negative semi-illiterate idiots, and all the over-rating star-happy idiots...OK, this book isn't eternal literature, but it's not tripe either. It is a children/adult workof pure fancy...much like The Hobbit is. And more so it is an ALLEGORY of the Iliad. I hate these polemics in criticizing...get your trite opinion-projecting straight. Some love it and somehate....but MOST, think it is a moderate-over-all-book.Should readers listen too these 'little' reviews, NO.Don't EVEN LISTEN to mine...just go out and READ this BOOK FOR YOURSELF, regardless if you accept it or reject it. IGNORE the IGNORANT reviews and create your OWN opinions."
2,drags on,This book was very boring. I could barely read it. Maybe it's not the type of book i can read or something but it just seemed to really drag on and the different vocabulary just threw me off. If your a rabbit go ahead and read the book otherwise don't bother
5,A book you can save and read over and over,"I first read this book when I was around 11 years old during the summer reading program at the library. I re-read this book almost 20 years later and was as engrossed in it as I was the first time. 20-odd years ago it was a fascinating story of what-if's, today it still is.Politics are politics, no matter if you are man or mouse.... or rabbit. The battle scenes in this story are amazing. You can almost feel each scratch and bite. I recommended this book when I was 11 years old and I would recommend it again today to everyone of any age."
5,Greatest Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!! :^),"The book Watership Down is a book about rabbits.Now I now you are thinking great a book about muddyburrowers. But it really is'nt, if you have read thebook Fire Bringher then you'll find that it hascopied Watership Down. Watereship Down is mostlyabout a quite scrawny rabbit called fiver. He, just in Fire Bringher, Has seeing powers. He sees that builders are going todevelop the rabbit warren, so he and his brother, anda few assorted rabbits willing to leave the warren.They pass thruogh many adventures in this great book.If you like adventerous books about spiecies that canhardly protect themesevles (such as hobbits in the Lordof the rings.) This is a great book for you!!!!!!:)"
3,My review of Watership Down,"I liked the book because it was funny in some parts. The made up words were interesting and the charecters were orignal. I didn't like how the made up words were used because you couldn't tell what the author meant to say.I think the best part of the book was were they were in the corn field playing and eating. The worst part was were they were traveling because it was hard to follow.The most vivid story elements were the charecters to me. The setting was also well done but, need some work in places. Overall this book was good reading."
4,Brave bunnies,"Delightful and enchanting story about a group of rabbits that leave their home in search of a more secure life. Of course they encounter myriad obstacles and adventures along the way, but the charm of the novel lies in its creation of a lapine culture, including a language and a story-telling custom. The rabbits ultimately end up in a struggle for their freedom and for the right to live in accordance with nature. I think you have to be a botanist to get through some of the descriptive paragraphs,which often read like a laundry list of trees and plants. Otherwise it's a very original and engaging story....A"
4,Lovely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"~This is a book with something more than a story. It is almost parallel to our own society. The story is one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Had to read this for Enlish class in High School, and fell in love with it before the book was even half read. The type of book you would never pick up off the shelf, but once you begin to read, there is something magical that happens. You begin to beleive and feel the pain and happiness of these characters. Never has a book with such a story ever touched me the way this book has. You must give this book a read, you will not be disappointed, you will be amazingly surprised!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~Although this book gets dull and drags at times, the cute rabbits make up for it!!!!!"
4,Good,"I read this book twice and it was great. i loved the way the rabbits faced conflict and heroism. it felt you were in the book with the other rabbits. i really think you should read it!!!!If you like rabbits, read this book!"
3,1,"A classic story of loyalty and survival. Simply an incredible story. It's intriguing, terrifying, and gives the reader much to think about in terms of social status, government and friendship. High schoolers will love the polotics."
4,"Best military stategy, if only the first part was good.",The first part of the book was boring I put the book down every five minutes.But at about 350 I couldn't put it down. I think it was the best military strategy.
4,Watership Up!,"nikki ferguson--Enjoyed this classic more as an adult then when I was in school. Favorite line, ""Silflay Hraka!"""
5,These bunnies will make you cry,"Who knew a story about rabbits searching for a home could be so moving, powerful and relatable? I would recommend this to anyone who likes animals. Or just good stories."
4,this book is annoying to read but very interesting,"Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, and the rest of the gang set out on a journey to find a new warren to live in, because their home sandleford warren is in trouble. They go through a lot of danger until they settle in the honeycomb on the watership down"
2,Tedious reding,"Interesting beginning -- not easy to read on a casual basis -- often I was sidetracked by the numerous ""created"" words for rabbit language -- Perhaps I will try once again later -- many other reviewers raved about this book -- I must be missing something .."
1,Watership Down,"This is the worst book I have ever tried to read in my entire life. I could barely get past the first 100 pages. If you are thinking about reading it-don't. Despite critic's ranting about how great this book is suppose to be, I think if you read it, you will find your opinion to be contradictory to these statements. It should be taken off all required reading lists. It is pure torture to endure, and is a poor excuse for a piece of literature."
5,ElmerFudd,"Beautifully written,must read CHILDRENS classic. Some schools and library's have banned this.They should NOT.It have true life analogies and still ring true throughout time.Beautiful artwork,I have an original but purchased this as a gift.Arrived quickly and was well enjoyed.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!Ella+Dandi=RIPDEMjr"
1,BORING!!!!!!!!,too much about fake stuff. had to read it for school. failed all of my tests because it was the worst and most boring book I have ever read!!!!!!
1,Low Reading Level,"The reading level of Watership Down was unbelievingly low, so low that it could be described as shocking. For lovers of middle school fictions, bunnies may excite you. Though mature and readers searching for a more challenging read should find some other novel to try on."
1,This book was terrible,"This book, by Richard Adams, was piontless. I was forced to read this for my Senior English class and I feel that it was the biggest waste of my time. I would only suggest this book to those who have nothing to do except to read about bunnies. There are many ""bunny"" terms that make the book hard to understand, and it is pointless. Watership Down is only for those who enjoy bunnies and Frith."
1,Huh?,Think before you buy this bookit may have an exciting title but once you read it you start to loose interest in the book pretty fast so I don't recomend this book because to me the book doesn't make any sence at all. I mean there are so many charicters in the story that the book gets really confeusing about who is who. I can't even remember witch rabbit told everyone that he thought he secned dander. This book is not recomendable at all!
1,A housewife's book,"This book full of pitiful and weak character. This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke. If you like reading about a weak, horrid, dull, whiny, annoying and above all...pitiful female character with no soul, passion, or feelings but greed, this is the book for you.Watership Down is one of the worst books with animals as main characters I've ever read."
4,Who knew rabbits are so interesting?,"Since I don't own rabbits nor do I like rabbits, I was suprised to really enjoy this book. I always find it interesting when an author uses animals to craft a very human story. It involves fath, friendship and cooperation plus so much more. These rabbits are shown that freedom is worth fighting for, and it really is inspirational. Read it."
5,Unexpected Twisting Plot,This book is excellent. Every time something happens it leads to something else. Also things that a normal person would discard immeadietly Richard Adams uses later in the book. Also this book is an adventure book with a toluch of mystery which is a great combo. Also there are stories in the story that senda shiver down your spine yet others make you laugh uncontrollably. This I am not kidding you is the best book I have ever read. It would be a crime not to read this book.
4,a long time ago,"I read the book in the 8th grade back in 1975. I remember going straight to the back to see how many pages and about fainted! However, once I got into it it was very compelling. It kept my attention, which was an achievement at my age. If any middle-schooler reads this review, I would suggest that you read at least 3 chapters before you pass judgement on it."
5,Cooments on the spanish translation,"I have read the spanish translation of this book ""La Colina de Watership"", and from that moment it has become one of my favorites. I am thinking about reading the english original, just to know if it is as amazing as the one I read."
5,The Best Book Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't look at the reviews just read it ! Honestly this is the best book I have ever read .
5,Touching Classic,When first being introduced to Watership Down I was nothing but skeptical. Talking rabbits seemed like a great thing to read if you had nothing better to do. I was dead wrong. I thought (at first) that I was wasting my time reading about talking rabbits. When I got into probally about the 3rd or 4th chapter I began to really get into the book. The bond between the rabbits is extraordinary. Their bond of friendship is unbreakable. Being a lover of many novels I highly recamend this classic. This story is unforgetable and is by far the best book that I have ever read.
1,worthless!,"Why would ANYONE like this distasteful piece of dreck? WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, LESS EVERYONE ON EARTH! I JUST DON'T GET IT, CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SEE THAT THIS BOOK IS DUMB? Like my review? email me at WDfandestroyer@hotmail.com"
1,I thought this was an awful book,"I thought that this book was one of the worst I have read. I had to read it for school and i could barely get through the first chapter let alone the whole book. Anyway, the only reasonI didn't fail the chapter quizzes was because of Cliff Notes and all the help from other friends. My advice to you, it is an evil book and don't buy, or ever read it. It isn't interesting or captivating, it was just plain stupid. I recomend, stick to the Cliff Notes and make your life easier. I'm just trying to spare you the pain that I went through for about 2 months. Everybody has different opinions, I just felt the need to share mine. Thank you for reading if you read this far and didn't believe I was a liar or something and think,""This is just one bad review out of about 800 good ones."" Anyway, here I am ranting, but please, do heed my advice."
1,I hate this book...,"I had to read this book in the 6th grade because I was in the ""gifted"" reading class and I was so sick of it after the very first page! I can't believe the author wasted so much time writing this book! It is VERY boring, just rabbits describing how great the grass is. VERY BORING"
1,You've got to be kidding me,"I cannot believe all these 5 star ratings. You have got to be kidding me. And the slams of those who rated it 1 star. I'm not stupid, I have a master's degree, intelligent and an avid reader of GOOD literature. This has got to be the most boring book I've ever tried to read. I have to read this book as a Battle of the Books coach. I finally quit half-way and relied on Cliff notes for practice questions. I never quit a book half-way. I'm not even going to make my students read this incredibly horrid book. I'm still just not getting all of the hundreds of 5 star reviews. What? What? What???"
1,skip it if u can!!,"Everyone says how this book is wonderful and has a greater meaning and the descriptions are wonderful blah blah blah..I had to read this book in english class and write reviews on it and answer questions I have never read anything more boring in my life! And one that loves to read..I couldn't believe what I was reading...When he's trying to explain how Fiver is scared in like 5 pages of details...no wonder i was getting more sleep lately ;) he could've easily cut the book half,if he didn't put so much detail into it... Maybe if I could actually not fall asleep after a page of reading I could describe how utterly flat and repetitive this book is. I hope you never have to go through reading this book....P.S. I recommend you to read Confessions of A Shopaholic (it's hilarious)"
4,The Hobbit with Rabbits,Watership Down is a great book and worth reading or giving to your kid over the age of 10. Just like The Hobbit (which this book reminded me of) there are several characters that get hurt and/or killed. If you like fantasy adventure books then this book is for you. I am not sure why I did not read it before. I am looking forward to when my kid is older so I can share it with him.
1,Another Over rated Book with no Passion,"Where's the substance that keeps you awake while reading a book? Not in this short little fiction, that's for sure. There was no apparent passion in writing this, or why the bunnies were the way they were. The characters-the bunnies- were so mono personality wise, they were all equal. They all thought the same way. They all acted the same way. Where's the originality? Above all...where's the book?"
1,A Boring Book,"I'm not exaggerating when I say this may be one of the worst books I ever read. This story started out as a bedtime tale for Richard Adam's children and should have stayed that way. The book is too drawn out. There are more details about the countryside than the heroic rabbits. Some parts are good, like when the rabbits go get does from the neighboring warren, but most of the book was just boring landscape details."
5,One of the great keepers of my youth....,"So much has been said about this wonderful book that I scarcely know what to add, other than to say, that along with John Crowley's, Little Big, Richard & Wendy Pini's, Elfquest, and perhaps Los Bros Hernandez', Love & Rockets; Watership Down remains among those books that I keep copies of in the hopes that if I ever raise children in this life, I'll have the time to read it to them. These are all books about life at its' fullest and most wonderful, stories I'd want a child to have imprinted somewhere the back of their memories and at the bottom of their hearts."
3,Okay,"I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best book ever because there are far more superior fictions than that written of bunnies. Not much plotting, an easy to read and easy to grasp book. Also, the metaphores were rather too simple don't you think?"
5,Best book I have read since The Republic of Plato,"At a glance, it seems just another talking animal-fantasy book. In actuality, the book combines animal science with imaginary culture to give you a blend of emotion and adventure you will never forget. I thought it was so good, I wrote a song about it."
1,Disappointed withg format,"I purchased this book in Kindle format for my dyslexic son. He uses the text-to-speech function to listen on his Kindle. Watership Down had that option greyed out, so he was not able to listen. I have read the book multiple times and know it as a classic. I want my son to be able to enjoy it as well. Unless the text-to-speech is allowed, he will never get to."
2,Fluffy Bunny are sickeningly cute and trite,"sdraper@top.monad.net from New Hampshire, USA , September 7, 1998I admit that this book isn't exactly packed with suspense, more like the dull writings of tuck everlasing. I know a lot of people are saying ""Talking bunnies, queer."" I don't see how this can be an English Honors book, unless you're in grade school, there was no meaning or anything between the lines about this book. Some places did start to drag a little bit, but on the whole this book was almost worth an average rating of 3 from me."
2,"Pointless, but entertaining.","One measure of the decline of American education is that while people once read the Greek and Latin classics in their teens, I was assigned _Watership Down_ in my sophomore year of high school. It's a good thing I never had to read _Tom Sawyer_ or _Crime and Punishment_ or _The Red Badge of Courage_ or ... in high school, or I wouldn't have had so much opportunity to educate myself later. Belton, Texas had a great plan for me. YEA!"
1,HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH THE BOOK?,"I was assigned this book for school reading. When I first started reading it, I hated it. I thought it was slow and too detailed. The more I read it, the duller it became, it became to cute,the bunnys were portrayed as bunnies, poor little victims who are at the bottom of the food chain. Is this a classic? I don't think so, even Dr. Seuss was more creative than this."
1,Very Monotanous,"This book is extremely monotanous, it has way to many details, and seems never-ending. So never ending that I didn't even finish the book."
1,Not much to say.,"I have read through it a few times but...maybe it's just way over my head. It just didn't click with me at all, I didn't feel anything coming from the words, they were just...there. It was quite dull and complicated and really confusing. I also read what seemed to be a ghost story by this same author, but it also didn't click with me, maybe it's his writing style? Ahh well. I'll give this book another chance, it has been a while since i've read it. I hope I haven't insulted anyone, this was just my experience with this particular book."
1,Talking Bunnies?,"This book was the worst book I've read in a LONG LONG time. It was the worst. I encourage everyone not to read this book. The author had to have a glossary in the back just because there were too many dumb terms that he made up. This was the stupidest book in the world. No wonder the author couldn't find someone to publish it. It was the dumbest book in the world. Did I mention that it was about talking bunnies? How totally dumb can that be? I recommend this ""book"" to anyone who is dumb enough to like it. DON'T READ THIS! SAVE YOUR TIME!!!!!"
1,Spare Me this Hideous Story,"I got bored around the 100th page. This book was first of all a pain to lug around, it was so heavy, and this was in paperback. Secondly, I hated the story. It was mushy and trite, please......I wish I got my time back."
5,The Greatest Book Ever Written,"To rate this book at only five stars is a crime. To rate it at ten stars is a radical understatement. To rate at at twenty... now you're getting somewhere.How anyone can even DARE to put down only one star here is beyond me...This is definitely the greatest book that I have ever read. I've had to repurchase it three times - my copies kept getting worn out from my rereading it so much. I still have my first copy - it's rubber-banded together and treated with as much reverence as I would give a Ming vase.If you haven't read this story, then you have not truly begun to read."
5,I loved this book.,"I thought this book was great. Sure it's 400 pages all about rabbits, which would make any teenager sigh. When in reality there are many hidden meanings in the book. Before long you give the characters personalities and it's easy to look at them as real people. From the muscles of Big Wig to the brains of Hazel this book will really hold your attention. It's a great book for kids and adults."
3,Peeps,"Peeps by Scott Westerfeld is a very captivating novel. The novel's main character is a guy named Cal. Cal moved from New Jersey to New York. Cal has a disease called peeps. Rats, cat, and any other person or thing that already has the disease (peeps) can spread it. Later in the novel Cal meets a girl named Lace, and they go through numerous ""adventures"" together. You will be able to follow them though all of them.I really did not enjoy Peeps by Scott Westerfeld very much. The novel was captivating at some parts. It was interesting learning about Cal's disease and finding out what he was going to do next. In the end I feel that the novel Peeps by Scott Westerfeld could have been more believable.I would recommend this novel to people who enjoy science fiction, and are at least 12 years old."
3,"grounded ""Vampires""","Peeps is another great ""Young Adult"" book from Scott Westerfeld, that like So Yesterday, is better than most adult fiction books out there.He re-tells the Vampire-myth in modern terms. He uses the science of parasites to explain how it could be transmitted and how it could transform the infected into Vampire-like-people.Scott is the master of the info-dump. Every second chapter tells the story of a different parasite. But it's done so well, it doesnt't feel like a lecture, just more interesting reading. And it allows him to refer back to the previously described parasites during the plot eaisly.I really enjoyed reading Peeps. I think its well suited to the Buffy-generation. I look forward to another book in this universe, which I believe is in the works.."
4,Different yet great,"This book was better than I expected. I picked it up at the library and finished it late late that night. Excellent read for young adults, not so much teens or mature adults."
4,Courtesy of Confessions of the UnPublished!,"Basic Plot: Vampires. Scott Westerfeld's take of them.My Thoughts...This book was a very pleasant surprise. All and all it was a really cool and fascinating take on Vampires. I was very hesitant to read it. It just wasn't quite what I'm used to. I mean I loved the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, but I just wasn't so sure about this one. I couldn't have been more wrong. I enjoyed it way more than I ever thought (4/5 Stars). This is a very smart, interesting book. It took vampires on in a whole new way. Now there is a lot of talk about parasites--and those with squeamish stomach may not like it, but I'm pretty much a baby and it was fine for me--but all the parasite talk was my favorite part about this book. I actually learned something. Very interesting. Try it out. You might be pleasantly surprised too."
4,Scientific Approach to Vampirism.,"I was a bit hesitant to read this book at first, because I'm not too fond of the scientific approach to tales of vampirism. However, I'm a Scott Westerfeld fan, so I decided to give it a go. I'm glad that I did. This book is addicting. I once stayed up reading until 6am, just because I didn't want to set it down. It's THAT good! I definitely recommend this book to others. Yet another great book from Scott Westerfeld!"
4,Peeps,"We chose this book for our book group, we have adult members, teenagers and pre-teens, all serious readers. It was a book that appealed to everyone. The book has an interesting twist on vampires and we all enjoyed learning about parasites. I thought the author interwove the story and the scientific facts well. I didn't rate it a five because I felt like the ending didn't quite match the storyline, it felt too rushed, a few more clues within the story would have developed the outcome a bit better. It is a worthwhile read that I have recommended and will continue to do so."
4,Peeps,"Wow. Peeps was an awesome book. Though it is about Cal Thompson who was infected by vampirism AKA ""a disease"" that is passed by kissing, It is full of many facts that have at least one thing to do with the story. I would definately recomend Peeps to any age."
3,Fun for a while,"Fun, smart, often witty. Though written for Young Adults, it can also be enjoyed by adult readers. Particularly if they are slightly geeky and enjoy smart and (mostly) science-based ""reinterpretations"" of old fantasy-cliches such as ""vampire myths"". Disappointing ending - the cool Darwinian reinterpretations got sort of lost in more mumbo-jumbo stuff, and the ending as a whole felt a bit sudden and contrived. But all in all I found it fine as a quick read to enjoy on my day-to-day commuting to work."
4,Great Book!!!,This book had me enthralled and is one of Scott Westerfled's best. Lovers of the Urban fantasy genre will enjoy this book. I felt like the events in this book could really happen so it was very real for me and is a great read!
5,save a bundle,worked as advertised. take it slow and will do the job. went throug the narrow pipe without any problems highly recommeneded.
5,It worked!,"To preface, I have never snaked a drain before and have only used chemical cleaners for drain clogs. I used two bottles of Draino which did not help with a slow draining stand-up shower in my master bathroom. I was a little tentative to use this snake, but I connected it to my power drill, turned it consistently at moderate speed, then pushed the snake down the drain. I could tell the clog wasn't deep because the drain would backup fairly quickly, so once I went down a couple of feet, I pulled back and caught onto something. I slowly pulled it out and grabbed a ton of hair that the Draino didn't even marginally melt away.I am very happy with my purchase! It worked well and was as inexpensive as the two bottles of Draino that I used. I can see myself using this many more times in the future!"
2,Fine if the clog's not too tough,"I used this item a few times for minor kitchen clogs and it worked as expected. But when I tried it on a hair-based clog in the bathtub drain, the pressure was too much for it. The plastic fitting that goes into the drill chuck shattered from the pressure that built up as the drill attempted to advance the snake into the hair clog. This item would be great if the shank were made of metal instead of plastic. I'm trying to find another one with a metal connection, but no luck so far. I may have to get another plastic unit and just hope for the best."
2,"Plastic shank, disappointing","I guess I was naive but I expected better. The shank you attach to a drill is made of plastic. Even if you baby it I can see this stripping out in a few uses. Looked like metal in the picture (silver) but the one I received is black plastic. But hey, it's cheap, you get what you pay for I guess"
1,Gear too Weak for Power,"This product seemed like a good idea when purchased however within the hour the gear between the snake and the drill had stripped. As nasty as the rest of the snake was it didn't seem worth it to try and return. We continued the job by twisting, pushing, and pulling the snake by hand. If you are looking for a snake I recommend you purchase one that comes with a roll-up case and that is rotated by hand."
3,Same Cable As a $15.97 Drain Auger Used,"The cable looks fine. However, you can buy a 25-foot drain auger for $15.97 from amazon. My last drain auger cable got a kink so I have to order this cable to replace the old cable. It fits in the old drain auger well after I remove the plastic shield."
1,cheap,Do not buy! Cheap plastic tip broke as soon as I turned on the drill! Cannot believe I didn't read reviews first!
3,"Good product, but not long enough for my drain system.","The drain snake is basically a good product, but you need to make sure that you get one long enough to reach the end of the drain system that is clogged. Also, the wire near the drill kinks easily if you're not careful. And, if it kinks once, it will kink much easier as you continue to use it."
2,Worked only once then rusted out.,"We used this snake once to clear our shower drain. Worked great. We cleaned it and then put it on the shelf for a little over a year. When we went back to use it on our shower drain a second time, we found that the inner part that is supposed to turn had rusted and so all the tension was building up in the cord. Okay, so we were able to free the rusted head to get it to turn again (the product calls itself rust resistant but that I guess resistant doesn't mean that rust isn't a problem). Seemed like this would solve the problem but then as we kept working the cylinder that attaches by the drill had gotten burned out with all the tension in the line from when the head was stuck. Now the inner mechanism won't turn at all. It's now headed for the trash and we're headed to the store.In sum, this product probably works well if you use it frequently so that it doesn't rust up. But know that it might not be a lasting product."
4,worked as well as any,They might consider adding a Velcro wrap to keep it together after use for storage after being used. Good quality
2,Not what I expected,"Item was not what I expected. Too stiff, only able to extend a short distance into the pipe, not flexible enough to move past the bend, which is where the problem is. Didn't take long to figure out it was not going to do the job we needed to have done. Now will still have to have a professional come, adding to the cost. Sorry, just not worth the cost."
2,25 foot long power snake,"The idea is a good one, but the first time I used it, it kinked in spite of me using a helper and going very slowly. I had to pull it out pull the toilet off the floor. I had to use another snake to check the rest of the line."
2,"It is just real ""Basics"" for non-engineer.","This book is just good for the one who've never experienced with process mapping before, it just provided the real basics, for anyone who want to get start. The author used examples from transactional process ( sale order), engineer who read and would like to see engineering process map example would not get from this book..The book focused on 2 types of process mapping methods. I like the points that author brough about the applicaton of process mapping in various areas that highlighted in chapter 6.Overall I would rate this book for 2, as in engneering expectation."
3,High level book,Very good but high level and not geared towards any specific type of processes. Good for beginners. very thin book...
3,A Very Basic Book,"This book is a small paperback, only 7"" X 5"" X 65 pages, so it doesn't go into great detail on any of the subjects. It does cover the basics such as flowchart symbols, process mapping, relationship maps and cross-functional maps. If you need to quickly prepare some flowcharts but don't know where to start this may be a good book for you."
2,I would not recommend it to an associate.,"The books attempts to give the reader a short introduction or insight into process mapping. Yet, it would go to in-depth for the basics. In addition, the author guises the reader by using different terminology for maps, such as deployment flowcharts, and IDEF models. The astonishing fact about the book is that in the end it attempts to tell you how to analyze a business. Readers are better off reviewing rengineering books."
3,A very basic introduction to processes,"I was looking for a book to help me broader my knowledge of processes. I didn't want a complete encyclopedia, just something usefull for begineers. This book is fine if you just want to have a general idea of mapping processes but it's quite simple. So, if you are looking for something more than just knowing the diferent ways to map a process and basics rules I think maybe there are better options. Anyway, for a very general knowledge could be a good option."
2,Explains how to without telling you why to,Tells you how to draw diagrams basically on paper. Not even good as an introduction to process mapping.
3,They were a little big,"The frames were a little big for what I wanted, but that was because of my measuring. They were fine otherwise."
5,My All-Time Favorite,"It was stunning, eye-opening, mind-boggling. Loved it. Love it. Still in my top five of all time."
5,The best book I've ever read.,I read Rushdie's incredible novel when I was in India and it was all the more special. Within the lives of 30 or so people born at Midnight on 14/8/47 (the moment India and Pakistan were cut free from British rule) Rushdie weaves an allegorical novel that summarises India's past and as those lives are lived comments on her future. The problems of Islamic Kashmir and the beautiful language that he uses in describing it are unforgettable.
4,Woah!,"This book is a COMMITMENT!I read it for a paper I wrote on Religious Prejudices in Indian Literature (dealing with Hinduism) along with ""God of Small Things"" and ""Death of Vishnu."" I got only 1/2 way through when it came time to write my paper... and still I'm pressing through it.530 pages... wow.This book was a little hard to get into at first. But then pages 80-200 were incredible. When the main character ""comes of age"" and recieves his ""gift""... the book is so intruiging and compels the reader to think of his/her own growing up experience.But as Saleem becomes an adult and goes to war, the book drags on and on for 200 more pages.I have 80 pages left, and i'm just excited to move on and read something else - not to hear the ending.This book has been beautiful... but a little too long. Just realize that you're getting yourself in for a LONG haul before starting it!"
4,A worthwhile novel,"Rushdie's Midnight's Children is sucessful on three levels.First, it is an enjoyable read. The imagery, style, and langauge are clearly first rate, and highly remniscent of Garcia-Marquez.Second, for a western reader with little knowledge of Pakistani-Indian history, the book provides a sweeping background of this important contentious region.Finally, the themes and ideas contained within the book, such as 'snakes and ladders' and 'midnight's children', are often insightful and novel.I was somewhat disappointed by the good-guy/bad-guy allusions to contempory politics, but overall, I felt that the knowledge and insight I gained from this book was clearly worth the effort."
4,Amazing tale of the entwined Fates of a Boy and a Nation,"""Midnight's Children"" was the second novel from Rushdie I read, but it remains my favorite. While my tastes in novels runs more towards Hemmingway I was unable to put this book down. I was held captive by the author's ability to include historical refferences of the birth of a nation into the complex story of Shiva and Saleem. I particularly liked the parallelism between the two boys and the gifts given to them by their midnight births. While this book can be difficult to follow due to it's historical reffernces I felt that it only added to the understanding of fate of Saleem's live. Overall I would highly recomend this book to those who have an interest in Indian History or enjoy an author with a great command of the English Lanugage."
2,"A clever book, a bit too clever!","The book is a allegorical polemic, done in great style. It has flashes of brilliance and very clever passages. But ultimately, it fails to transcend the contortions of its plot to great, universal literature."
3,Well-constructed framework bloated with anecdotes and words,"Clever idea. Politically correct book. Historical fiction. An educational book for the uninformed western observer. Despite all these positives, there is little that drives the narrative, and much like the magical realism of Love in the Time of Cholera, the story is overly weighted by anecdote after anecdote and by the seeming inevitability of a trite conclusion. Rushdie's language is at times inventive and rich, and at moment's stirring. But overall the story is bogged down by inconsequential details, overly repetitive motifs and structure, and the lack of a really compelling and immediate story. As a middle-aged man, in general I no longer find novels highly engaging, so you can take that with a grain of salt as well."
3,3? what?,"yes, i give it 3 stars. this is odd because it's the lowest i've ever rated a book. i think. the book was wonderful but it just took Rushdie so darn long to bring it together. and even when this was accomplished (in the last 150 pages of 520), it was a bit anticlimactic. very vivid ending to the story but i just think that you might pick up 'the moors last sigh' before you pick this one up."
2,Feckless like the anglicized Indians that it represents,It is a strange thing that the modern elites of India are unconnected to their own civilization and for them impressing the westerner is the most important task. Rushdie is the perfect example of such an Indian. For an authentic view of India we must still turn to V.S. Naipaul.
3,Lost in the maze,"I enjoyed the first couple of chapters of this book immensely but got lost at the end. It flows brilliantly in some parts, and is completely confusing in others. Honestly I did not know what to make of the book."
2,Pretentious nonsense; beautiful scenery,"For a book that has received so much praise this is maddeningly self-indulgent. Rushdie details the struggles of partitioning and the development of India with fantastic skill but the main plot is too self-aware. In any other guise this might be described as fantasy but, of course, it is too worthy to be listed as such. Tiresome in the extreme despite the poetic nature of the prose, this is one to read if you want to show off at dinner parties."
1,very very difficult,"Unfortunately this is one of those books that are not to be taken lightly.It is a very difficult read, the author has no desire to make it easy for the reader, the temptation to put down the book is constant.I finally decided to skip entire parts that made no sense at all and tried not to waste completely my time. It will take a lot of time and attention, think twice before embarking on it"
2,not a great novel,"There's a lot of praise for this book, and I thought I'd put my two cents in. One important note: Rushdie PURPOSELY inserts historical innacuracies, so don't think you're getting an accurate historical account - that's done on purpose. Indeed, from a post-structuralist theoretical standpoint, Rushdie's project is clearly to deconstruct. But, he goes nowhere with it. His whole novel can be summed up in a few lines: The popular version of history is inherently corrupted by social mediating forces; so, in order to combat that force, I'm going to offer MY version of history to show that there is no ONE history. It's a pretty standard argument, but he doesn't develop it beyond that. I would suggest that you look to Faulkner (who focuses on history's lingering qualities) or Ellison's Invisible Man (in which he focuses on how to break through cycles of historical oppression). They handle the effects of history in a much more engaging and profound way."
5,Midnight's children,"Amazing book. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to India or visiting it. It provides a rich literary experience and adds a touch of ""masala"" to an ingenious and rare story."
1,Too Wordy,I struggled my way through this book and found the writing style hard to get used to. The main character wasn't likable and I didn't feel much sympathy for him. I also thought that changing some of the character's names or using nicknames at some times and not others was confusing and unnecessary.I know it gets a lot of rave reviews so maybe I'm just not intellectual enough to enjoy it but my tip would be to try before you buy.
1,Very boring. Just a lot of words put together with no story.,A meaningless collection of words. A boring story line if any at all. I could not complete the book; sorry.
5,Wonderful Imagery!,"Wonderful Imagery!Rushdie creates a wonderful panorama and guides us through post-1947 nehru's india toward indira's new india as his characters move across the length and breadth of india, associating themselves with history, witnessing its events, and occasionally being a part of them. From the old Kashmir with the silent dal lake to the massacre at Jallianwalbagh, From the Streets and Forts of Delhi to the language riots of Bombay, From the military coups in pakistan, along the mysterious rann of kutch to the Mangroves of the Sunderbans, the story keeps turning while showing you all the nuances, sentiments, and personalities of the indian subcontinent. The characters are brilliantly depicted in rich variety and grab the readers attention immediately. It's not a history book but it presents history with stunning images in rushdie's wonderful hinglish. A wonderful read!"
1,SR's ego trip,"I was really looking forward to this book. The subject, the repercussions till today ... I have lived a very long time in this geographical area and have therefore a deep interest.Rushdie's book reminded me of so many visits of locals where at the end you were asking yourself, what was the purpose and what were we talking about? These instances and the book have one thing in common: a complete waste of time. And Indians, as well as Nepalis, are very good at that.In Midnight's Children it seems that SR's ego - and boy, so called Indian intellectuals do sport quite some ego - simply went haywire. The book is an exercise in overtwisting a twist, in being oh so very clever or as the Germans say it approaches the subject 'from the back through the chest and into the eye'."
2,unbridled but unwarranted enthusiasm,"Rushdie is so in love with his own writing and condescending of his reader that he feels it necessary to explain his themes and symbols, and to periodically review the main points of the story. I admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters and some of the wordplay, but most of it is out-of-control, self-indulgent rubbish. It is very disappointing to me that this book has won so much critical acclaim."
2,difficult to read,I've read another one of his books and thought it was very good. This one was too disjointed for me.Frankly no one in our reading group enjoyed it.
3,Great story-telling but not much else.,"Rushdie is a great plot-weaver, no question about it. However, as a native of the Indian subcontinent, I feel that he falls short in giving a true sketch of life there. Perhaps this is because he himself is a migrant. This is an aspect of the novel that many Westerners cannot really pick up on, but that sticks out in my mind. Also, it would help if Rushdie weren't such a pervert."
3,Book Club Bail Out,"The length and density of Midnight's Children was too much for 50% of my family and friends book club. Non-finishers included both 30-somethings and 60-somethings. Those of us who persevered found the book enriching and enlightening. The writing style and vocabulary were discouraging to the more concrete readers in the group. I will read another of his books someday, but I will not recommend it for book club!"
5,Vivid prose,"This is a truly luscious book to be savored slowly. Take your time, let it breathe, and prepare to be amazed by astounding associations and a visceral and intimate portrait of a nation. Then wait a bit, and read it again...."
4,Beautiful as well as haunting,Rushdie has such a mastery of language as well as imagination. Midnight's Children is complex yet draws the reader into it's world. This world is not only beautiful but is full of very human emotions and their flaws. Rushdie's characters are full of life and this book is wonderful.
5,"Every book I have read after this one, has been a let down.","A rich and colourful book that takes you into a fantasy and mystical world. English may be Salman Rushide's second language, but he has mastered it better than most contemporary writers. I cannot read another book after Midnight's Children with as much excitment. It is a must read for anyone.A Booker Prize for literature is nto enough. I nominate it for the Pulitzer."
2,Difficult to Absorb,"Despite its rave reviews, the author's Wwiting style or ""voice"" in which every sentence contains a multiplicity of parenthetical ,sometimes extraneous, statements forced me to abandon the novel as slogging through the maze was just too tiring to be enjoyable."
3,A very challenging read,"If you are looking for a nice relaxing book to read this is not the one for you. However if you are looking for a challenge then you may just enjoy this novel. The story is heavily hidden within the pages and at occasionally I was lost in the rambling sentences that at times,went on for more than a page.I was hoping for something profound to happen at the end of the story but it just sort of petered out as if the writer got tired of telling the story.Perhaps I am just not of a high enough intelligence to truley appreciate this epic tale."
2,Tedious and boring,"I wanted to read a Rushdie book and I've heard this book being called the ""Booker of the Bookers"" (referring to the prize). Rusdie's writing may be poetic and beautiful, but it is hard to trudge through this fairly long book. Furthermore, Midnight's Children is not particularly educational as far as Indian history and culture. The author may deserve his great reputation for his writing style but don't expect to be entertained.Reading this book made me feel like I was back in highschool and reading a required book for English class. My apologies to literature lovers who may consider me a philistine."
3,"interesting read, but not ""best of breed""","Midnight's Children is a fantasy voyage into the world (and underworld) of modern Indian life. Rushdie seems to relish in introducing whimsical characters and side-stories to balance the rather disturbing elements of Indian(/Pakistani) society.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find Midnight's Children to be a masterpiece. It often becomes a tedious read as Rushdie seems to elaborate on his characters into needless detail. And the fantastical elements of the story are, well, a bit over the top. Having said this, this book is a must read for people who are fascinated with modern India (..such as myself).While comparing novels is a dangerous (and unfair) game, I have to recommend Son of a Circus by John Irving over Midnight's Children. Both share the same overall theme (story on modern India without taking itself too seriously), with Irving's novel being a much better read (funnier, less fussy on details, generally easier to read)."
3,"Not a fan of Rushdie, however...","Midnight's Children is certainly an interesting read, and I admire Rushdie's attempt at writing a very different type of novel. I will spare you the novel synopsis, as others have probably gone to great lengths to recap the story. Keep in mind, that the story does flip back and forth in the memories of the writer (which is different from Rusdie).I didn't particularly like the Satanic Verses and I read this novel for a class on Expatriate Literature. As Expatriate Literature goes, this was a great exploration of the theme.Well worth reading."
3,"Oh, spell it out, spell it out.","There's a good 200-250 page novel in here; the question is whether or not you're willing to slog through nearly 600 pages to find it. The biggest problem I had with this book is that Rushdie apparently thinks his reader is an absolute idiot who must be led by the hand across even the most obvious metaphorical thresholds. It speaks volumes, I think, that the reader surrogate here is the lumpen, dim-witted Padma, seated fawningly at the narrator's feet while he writes. Yes, I know we shouldn't conflate the author and the narrator, but it's hard not to think that Rushdie shares more than a little of Saleem's condescension toward his reader. At least Rushdie has the courtesy to warn you on the first page -- ""Oh, spell it out, spell it out."" That he does. It's an interesting story, but the tedium of the overbearing narrator just sunk it for me."
3,Once is definitely enough,The ideas behind this novel are very creative and promising however the actual story drags more than once. The last third of the book is slow and boring then rushed at the very end as if Rushdie lost interest himself. I was enraptured for the first half and yawning for the second. I'll pass on seconds.
1,goodbye Salman,"The first half of the book is a drag regarding his growing up stage. Seen along with Satanic Verses that had even a larger portion that was difficult to keep my attention, no more of Salman Rushdie for me."
3,"Ambitious, but too long","I had never read any of Salman Rusdie's work until this novel. (I was told this was a good place to start with Rushdie.) I admired very much the ambition of MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN. Rushdie is to be commended for trying to write a great book. He almost did it. The first half is really vivid and enthralling. Rushdie's prose is truly winged. However, somewhere about halfway through the novel (about the time the narrator leaves Pakistan), I lost interest and the rest of the book became a chore to finish. There really wasn't much of a payoff either, considering all the time invested in reading such a thick book. I think MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN would have been a much stronger book had it been pruned by at least a third. There were also too many loose ends for my taste. I'm glad I read the book though, and I think I have a pretty good idea of Rushdie's strengths and weaknesses as a writer now. It's not a bad book, but it's far from being a masterpiece."
3,Way over rated!,"While prolific at times, there is too much ""borrowing"" from other authors, which I found upsetting. Particularly Marquez's use of ""butterfly imagry"" and the non-stop sentences. Can't we be a little more original? This really irritated me. I plowed through this book, and found some parts flowing and well written, while other parts were forced over exaggerations, and very pretentious on the authors part. Don't know how I ever managed to finish it, but was glad when it ended, leaving me with very little (I read it in India, but that didn't help). While an Indophile, I tend to read everything Rushdie anyways, and feel he doesn't come into his own until ""The Moors Last Sigh,"" which I really loved. I am now busy with ""Ground Beneath Her Feet,"" which so far (and I just began), has a bit of immaturity and silliness to it, but I'll give it a chance. I feel ""Midnight's Children"" is a bit disjointed and its ""brilliance"" is very inconsistent."
5,Prose master extraordinnaire.,"Mr. Rushdie never disappoints. This perspective of India's turmultuous history from one man's view is haunting and heartbreaking. His simplest sentences are crafted with such beauty, I repeatedly would reread whole paragraphs just for the pleasure of the author's mastery of words."
5,Thought provoking,A wonderful book I found the language rich and totally enthralling and the metophor fascinating. I felt that the Character Saleem was deeply tramutised and his personal experiences and split from reality mirrored the trauma of the independance/partitation of India.
2,Too much Poo,"While I enjoyed the magical realism of the book and the exotic setting, I did not care for the characters. Feces run through this book. At one point, the narrator describes a man defecating into his own hand and proudly proclaiming the length of this fecal masterpiece. The beauty of the language is literally mired in filth."
3,Not his best work,"My introduction to Rushdie was via his novel Shame. By the end of that novel, I was just enamoured with the man. Every one told me that the midnights children is his best work and I could only salivate at the quality of story telling that I would get from reading this book then. Afterall if this was supposed to be better then Shame, it had to be the best thing ever written (for me that is).Based on this assumption, I started reading midnights children but unfortunately where Shame took me 4 days to finish, this book took me over 3 weeks to read. The story is not very interesting though the character development and weaving was well done. The book does drag on sometimes and caused me to lose track of what the story was at certain specific points in the book.This is a 3 star book for me at best."
4,Another interesting Salman Rushdie book.,I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed other books by Salman Rushdie. I learned quite a bit about this period in the history of India & Pakistan.
2,Confusing Book that does not live up to its promise,"I got this book because I thought the premise was very interesting, but I'm having a hard time at page 75 getting to anything that even hints of it. Rushdie's current work is not supposed to be as good as his earlier works, but I would much prefer his memoir to this ""story."" I read some of the good reviews and I realize my opinion may be in the minority, however, if you want a book to immerse yourself in over the holidays, this is not it."
3,Needs Footnotes,"The three stars does not indicate any lack of ability on Rushdie's part, only my lack of connection. I can read an Eco novel and laugh myself silly because I have enough knowledge of his references to get most of the metaphors. Too late I found a website that promises to unravel Midnight's Children for Westerners without a background of Indian history and mythology - I think I'll try to read a bit of that as the days go on to see if I can get a better grasp on the novel I just read. I don't give up on Rushdie. I loved The Enchantress of Florence and the interviews I have heard with him have left me with the desire to read more of his stuff. If you're going to tackle Midnight, however, I'd bone up a little first. [...]"
3,"Liked the Story, Just not how it was told","I liked the story in this book. The whole idea was very clever and the characters were likable. However, it took me forever to finish this book due to the writing style. In short, it was confusing. The writing was hard to follow and half the time I had no idea what was going on."
4,"Amazing, but very long","This truly is an amazing piece of literature, but its impact gets bogged down a bit by its length and the overwhelming amount of detail (though that seems to be part of the point). I'm not much of a history buff, but I did enjoy learning more about India's recent history from Saleem's perspective. When I finished the novel, I was physically and mentally exhausted, more glad to be done than anything else, but, despite that, I am very glad to have read it. The story itself is not boring, but it does take a lot of time to get through, so I would not recommend reading this when you are particularly stressed or hurried (as I did), because you won't be able to get through it."
2,A cartoon epic,"The book is too extravagant. The word play is often totally baseless (such as dung-lotus for Padma), although Western readers may not be knowledgable enough about the background to know that, and the racy plot has scenes like in a cartoon book. Very clever but certainly not literature that will stand the test of time. Rushdie's `Satanic Verses' is a much better novel."
2,Didn't do it for me,"I guess you have to be a historian on India and its culture because if you are not (like myself), the book was confusing. I could not distinguish the fantasy from the reality - which may have been the intent. Although I fell short on understanding, I feel that Rushdie is an artist in the literary sense."
5,Quite Simply A Masterpiece!,One of the best books ever written. Just the language is so very beautiful and the story so captivating. Do not be daunted by its size or subject matter. The book is very easy to read. One of my favorite books of all time.
2,struggling to stay interested,"this was recommended by a doctor friend i met while travelling in borneo last year. i have tried a few times now, still struggling to really 'get into it' though. i wont quit. hopefully i can post a better review when i can finally finish it."
2,"Clever, but not a great novel","My explanation for two- and five- star ratings for the book is just the opposite of what an earlier review surmised. I believe it is 5-star by those people who know India/Pakistan only superficially and so assume that Rushdie is on to something; it also includes the Macaulayites or those Indians/Pakis who have learned about it secondhand from English books. Often the word-play, puns, or etymologies used by Rushdie don't make sense."
2,Disappointing,"I really love all of Howard's most recent works, and many of her earlier works as well (""White Lies,"" ""Diamond Bay,"" ""Midnight Rainbow,"" even ""Against the Rules""). This, however is not one of the ones I like.Howard has always written about very Alpha Male heroes. In some of her earlier work, including this one, she takes that portrayal to an extreme. The ""hero"" in this work seems lacking in emotion and even leaning towards the emotionally abusive.The ""heroine,"" on the other hand, is written as an emotional wimp. It's written that she's ""strong,"" but she lets the ""hero"" walk all over her, making herself totally emotionally available to a man who, quite frankly, seems unworthy of it.I love most of Howard's work, but this is not a book I'm going to keep in my personal collection."
3,Just ok,"This novel is a nice easy read, but nothing more. The plot is not sophisticated at all, it just glows, goes and leaves no trace at all once you finish reading it."
3,Not a very good example of her writing!,"I believe this is one of her earlier novels & I think it shows. All a bit soft & ""wishy washy"", with too many cliched scenes & characters. I felt I wanted to shake the ""heroine"" at times! Fortunately I've read many other Linda Howard books, so I know how much better she can write & no doubt I will continue to enjoy other books of hers."
1,Worst Linda Howard Novel Yet,"I was glad to see that this was an earlier (1985) effort for Ms. Howard, since I've enjoyed several of her more recent books. The story was what you expect from Linda Howard, but the wording was so ultra-flowery, over-the-top, and full of cliches that I was wondering at one point if it was somehow intended to be a parody of the romantic genre. --but no. I've noticed that Linda Howard does tend to recycle some of her descriptions from book to book. --Imagine taking all of her cheesiest descriptions from each of her books, concentrating them into one small book and removing the more believable character development. That's this book, a stick figure Linda Howard novel with saccharine descriptions stuffed around it in an attempt to fill it out."
5,Disturbing and chilling!,"Sophie is one of the chilliest, most disturbing novels I've recently read. The tension and suspension build to a disarming climax as siblings Matthew and Sophie tell their childhood stories. Matthew wants to understand Sophie's above-average intelligence. Sophie has a brilliant mind, and Matthew has worshipped her for it. That is until he is forced to see Sophie as she truly is: manipulative, controlling and sinister. There are various disturbing twists throughout the novel. The ending is flooring. This is one of the best psychological thrillers ever written. I shall look to Guy Burt's work in the future. Highly recommended..."
1,The Worst Book Ever!,I picked up this book thinking it would be suspenseful and maybe interesting. This book was nothing but confusing and left me extremely frustrated at the end. I definately do NOT recommend this book!
1,Boring,"Absolutely no story line, I only made it to the end out of curiosity and it was very disappointing. Hopefully, other Burt novels are better."
3,Franklin Scrabble Players Dictionary (SCR-226),"Scrabble (with Official Players Dictionary)I found this electronic Dictionary helpful, but also annoying because it has not been updated to reflect the newest Official Word List (OWL2) of the Scrabble Assn. It is OK. Hopefully Franklin will update this product."
1,Franklin Deluxe Edition The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary,"I have purchased 2 Franklin Deluxe Edition The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary from Barnes and Nobles Book Store within the past 2 years, because the quality of them are very poor. Either one of them haven't lasted a year. The keys on the keyboard sticks and finally I had to remove the rubber keys and use the tip of a pen to press the keys in order to type in my word. Then it started not to work at all. Every time I wanted to type in a word I would push on a letter it would say ""Type in your tiles"" to every letter I pushed. I paid 53.00 each time I purchased this Electronic Scrabble Dictionary and it is not worth it . It just a poor quality gadget that isn't worth the money I paid for it. I would like to know how I can get a refund."
2,Disappointed,"Big disappointment, more so because it was a gift.The first word we looked up wasn't in it!Bigger nuisance than help."
1,Electronic Scrabble Dictionary,"This is an excellent tool for playing Scrabble. We find it very helpful, simple to use and moves the game along quickly. The one we purchased from you was a replacement as the original one was lost. As you can see, we do like it and never play Scrabble without it. As a matter of fact, we convinced our friends to purchase one also which they did and enjoy the use of it very much. Much easier than using a regular Scrabble dictionary.Also very educational."
4,Great item for the non-conformist Scrabble player,"First- let me say; I have to give this a 4, I'm afraid the quality of the item is not the highest standard. It is beginning to have trouble pressing buttons, and giving all word possibilites. I think this is because we use it so much. I have used this item for about 5 months, anywhere from 2-3 hours a day! It is great for entering letters, and having the item (we call it ""the brain"") tell you all the available words. Can't play scrabble without it!"
2,"good machine, but outdated","good device, but needs an update to the 4th edition of the scrabble dictionary."
1,Out of Date,"This would be a great idea if it were not out of date. This uses the 3rd edition Official Scrablbe Dictionary. The 4th edition came out in 2006. It does not have many words, such as ""za"" or ""qi"" in it. If there were an up to date version, I'd buy it."
5,For more than just Scrabble,"I bought this to play the games in it, as I like Scrabble. But I found that I also use it as a dictionary, to check spelling, for crosswords, for other word games and to verify a word's existence. The games are fun, I'll admit. I particularly like ""Mystery Word""Also, you are able to set your level of play, easy, intermediate and advanced.It's quite a useful item, small enough to chuck into your bag if you're execting a wait at the doctor's office, but easy to read thatnks to a fairly large display screen.I paid $50 at a retail store in town, even that to me was a deal. Amazon's a bit cheaper, so still a great deal. Recommended."
2,?,"The one I ordered first this year, was defective. I got a new one, and it also does the same thing...when you hit ""back"", it clears your letters. I am still very unhappy with my purchase. These machines cost too much money not to work properly. The one I bought two years ago worked for a long time and I never had a moments trouble with it. I would like a new one to replace this second one. Tona Brown"
5,Great Product,"I have the original Model SCR-30. I have been using it for many years, while playing Scrabble and Boggle, and it still works fine. This new model has extra features in it to keep kids occupied, also. I recommend it highly. Don Brooks"
5,Great Item,"I bought my wife a new cell phone and she downloaded Scrabble on it. She got hooked on the game. As a B/D gift I bought her the Franklin Scrabble Companion. She loves it. Now I think I have to get a second wife that doesn't like Scrabble so I can have someone to talk too. But seriously, it is great, she loves it. Now my daughter wants one for Xmas."
5,Trirkyyy,"Awesome cd. Friends and family my favorite!!!! Sacrifice also hits the spot!!.I would recommend to anyone who likes Godsmack, Linkin park or even alitlle Korn."
3,"If you like Friends and Family, Check out ""Mazzy Star""","The music of the song is ripped off from Mazzy Star's ""Five String Serenade"". It is still a good song though, as good as a ""sampling"" effort gets."
1,NOT EVEN GOOD BACKGROUND NOISE.,"5 STARS FOR ""FRIENDS AND FAMILY"" ZERO STARS FOR THE REST OF THE ALBUM. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS THAT YOU'LL FIND A DOZEN COPIES OF IN YOU LOCAL USED CD MUSIC STORE, BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S TRADED IT IN. SERIOUSLY IN NO TIME THIS ALBUM WILL CLUTTER THE RACKS. IF YOU LIKE THE SONG ""FRIENDS AND FAMILY"" YOU'LL FIND IT ON THE ""MR. DEEDS SOUNDTRACK"" AMONGST OTHER SONGS WORTHY OF A LISTENING EAR. TRIK'S ALBUM GOES BY WITHOUT YOU EVEN HEARING IT. THE MUSIC JUST DOESN'T TAKE YOUR MIND OFF OF THINGS THE WAY I LIKE MY MUSIC TO. TRIK TURNER SHOULD BE INSPIRED BY THIER FRIENDS AND FAMILIES MORE OFTEN."
1,overhyped and catching the tail ends of a fading genre,"Generic, formulaic, and boasting hip-hop rock beats, hinting of rap-metal, but fallig short. What makes it worse is that is being hyped by lycos and the record companies leading people to believe that mainstream=good all for the sake of making $$$$. Nothing wrong with this band, but they are just an ""ok"" band with a corporate business pushing their music in our faces."
2,Don't Waste Your Money...,"I bought this boring album after hearing ""Friend & Family"", which I thought, and still think, is a beautiful song. That's their only beautiful, or even good, for that matter, song. The rest of the songs are either too cocky, repeatitive, have too much rap, have stupid lyrics, show bad musicianship, or just sound too unoriginal to enjoy. Skip this CD, and for that matter, skip all raprock albums in which rap is dominant over rock...except for Transplants. Want some good raprock? Check out Linkin Park, P.O.D., or Papa Roach."
2,It Dissapoints...,"Saw ""Friends & Family"" on MTV, bought CD, good first impression, soon foind out only 2 good song, disappointed. Clear enough?"
4,It is a good start,"This is the most complete catalog of scripophily items I have found. (It is the only one I have been able to locate.) The book is organized well, and is fairly complete. I find at least two thirds of the issues I have been looking for in it. As for the listed pricing, the prices seem to be fair compared with what I have encounterd in the market. There are plenty of photographs, though most are blabk and white.The book would be improved if they added details on how to adjust pricing for the condition of the document. In addition, if they added more general information on the field it would be helpful. Of course for later additions, I hope that they will add more items to it.In general though, it is a good book."
1,Junk Stocks,This book contains many stocks and bonds that no one would collect. I sold many of these to the author for $1.00. There are many good references out there. Try George LaBarre's Books. They're out of Print but can be found on here and Ebay. The Author should stick with his other subject matter we writes about and Shame on Krause Publishers. They should have used a established dealer or the IBSS.
3,"Useful, but in need of serious editing","Overall, I found this to be a helpful book as I try to re-kindle my interest in electronics after many years away from the hobby. It contains much good information and a great deal of detail with respect to setting up a home electronics workshop. In addition to suggesting commercially available products it also offers plans and parts lists for home built testing equipment. It would have been more useful if the author had provided PCB diagrams for the various projects outlined or a least a source for these boards.My major complaint is that the book needs some serious editing. I have not read the whole book yet, but I have come across several sentences that were clearly overlooked in the editing process. Parts of the book are needlessly repeated almost word for word from earlier sections. The whole book is in much need of a critical re-editing and corrections.Apart from these problems I did find it a helpful and useful addition to my library of electronics books."
3,BUILD YOUR OWN ELECTRONICS WORK SHOP,"The book is more about doing electronics than how to build a work shop. He covers what insruments you need in the order of importance and how to build simple test equipment that you may need. In general there is a chapter about each major piece of test equipment and how to use it. There is a similer chapter on tools. The main concept is how to build new electronics and how to repair electronics. I think the equipment you need depends on what type of work you expect to do, thus some of the recommendations may not not apply to you. For example, you do not need a giga hertz range oscilliscope or signal generator if you are not working in the ultra high frequency range. The complexity of electronic equipment increases with the increased frequency involved. For a person new to electronics, I suggest that you begin with low or audio frequencies, and progress upward to about 5 megahertz first. Your equipment is much less expensive in that range, than much higher up."
3,"Comprehensive, but lengthy","First, it's a pretty heavy book, hundreds of pages. That's not necessarily bad except when the text goes on..and on...and on...and... Perhaps it's the typeface?I'd have liked it better if the author had included a QUICK START chapter!As an (unconscious) proofreader I found multiple errors as I skimmed the book,both in the grammar, punctuation and in a few pictorials. I'd say it's probably a good book for Reference, but don't try to read it cover-to-cover as I usually like to do. I put it down after crawling through the first two chapters.At about $15 or more it's overpriced; a better deal would've been $10.Sorry I can't recommend an alternative off the top of my head, I knowthere's more like this one out there.Happy Reading!-Criticatlarge"
5,Excellent piece of furniture,"I'm not really a review writer. Kind of lazy about it. But I figured this furniture needed a review. I was a bit apprehensive about buying when there were no reviews up about it so I took a chance and felt the least I could do would be to put up a review so that any other hesitant customers may be able to see what at least one other person thought.That being said, I love the pieces (I got 2 of the black ones). They were much higher quality than I expected for the price I paid (I got them when they were on sale for half the price). They were well-packaged and came in perfect condition less than a week after ordering. I was worried about the paper being torn but it is much sturdier than I expected. They will go perfectly with the platform bed we are also purchasing."
4,"great value, great effect",we're very happy with our night stands. these would also make great end tables in your living room. great value! the night stands are shipped nearly fully assembled; just put the top on and you're done.
5,Great book,"I haven't gotten much chance to read it yet, but it's a great book, especially as a reference."
5,comprehensive and reader friendly,great compilation of information for novice and experienced runners alike. Author is especially keen to cite additional sources of information should the reader need to investigate further on a given topic.
4,"Gift for sister, went over well",I haven't read it but it was a gift for my sister and I can at least see it was exactly what she wanted and she was happy.
4,Excellent,"I bought this book because I'm told it has everything about running. It does, but, as a beginner, it's not what I was looking for. It doesn't advise so much as educate. I can now tell you all about pronation and the history of waffle treads, but I'm still not sure what my next pair of shoes should be.Excellent and thorough book though. I've read much of it."
5,A complete running phillosophy,This book provides a common sense approach to running backed up by detailed sceintific data and analysis. As such it very usefull for everyone in athletics from the novice to pro and coaches. It will definitely help you get the best out of yourself while avoiding the pitfalls. The best I have seen and one that I continue to find usefull after 4 years of reading and 15 years of running.
2,Not what was expected,"I bought this CD thinking I was purchasing gospel music. I was so disappointed to hear disjointed music, non-lyrical tunes, Wish I could return it and get my money back.."
4,Great for those who are already Tortoise fans.,"You get maximum bang for your buck with this 4 disc set, which includes a DVD. As a longtime fan, it was great to hear unreleased tracks and see the band perform live on the DVD. Although the remixes are interesting, they are not exactly the high point, and I find myself skipping the 'remixes' of some of my favorite songs. But there are those gems that you will not want to pass up. If this is to be your first Tortoise CD, you're probably better off with TNT, Standards, or The Brave And the Bold (if you require vocals)."
4,A great deal,"The videos on the DVD are great. Some of the live stuff is pretty good, particularly the recording of ""salt the skies"" and the 40+ minute set. The CD's may include a little too much material, but there is plenty of good work to find on these 3-discs. Recommended."
2,A very difficult read,"This book has excrutating details of the 2nd day preparations and battle. If you are really into the minutae of the terrain, troop movements, and backgrounds of not only key players but many of the junior officers, then this is the book for you. Otherwise it is a very difficult read. So many soldieres are discussed that it is difficult to keep track who is Union and who is conferderate. Without referring constantly to a small black and white map of the Gettysburg I would have been comletely lost."
4,A very detailed well researched book.,This is the most detailed look at the second day of Gettysburg I have ever seen. He gives very exacting positions of the moves of various regiments in some complex battlefield areas such as the Wheatfield and Devils Den. I did not give it a five star rating simply because the movements got very difficult to follow at times. Still an excellent work and worth trying out.
2,Kindle Edition - Unreadable Maps,"This is for the Kindle Edition. I really enjoyed the hardback edition, enough that I purchased the Kindle version as well. Unfortunately the Kindle version has maps that were so small as to be unreadable. What was worse is that they were scanned at such a low resolution that when I tried to zoom the the Maps on my Ipad, the just blurred out. This has not been a issue with other books. With a battle with numerous units and key place names, readable Maps are a must. I returned the Kindle Edition."
2,A Great Disappointment,"Pfanz's book is notable not only for the information it contains, but also for the information left out. Unlike Martin's ""Gettysburg, July 1"", Pfanz has definite opinions about the people and their judgements at Gettysburg. And he is more than willing to add/twist/omit certain facts to make his case. In summary, while Pfanz presented some interesting information, that information can readily be found elsewhere. Further, his ""wise cracks"" and omissions make his conclusions very suspect. I would NOT recommend this book to any serious student of Gettysburg. I regret I purchased my copy; I think you will feel the same."
5,"excellent narrative throughout, highly reccomended","Fantastic book!! Not only does Mr Pfanz describe individuals associated with the second day of fighting at Gettysburg, but he also gives excellent summaries of the units fighting as well. The definitive book for the 2nd day of battle at Gettysburg. A MUST for Civil War historians and enthusiasts alike"
4,A must read book.,Very detailed fighting of the 2nd day. A suggestion is to bring the book when visiting the battlefield. You can use the maps in the book to get a better understanding of the troop movements.
3,Bellini a plagiarizer!!!,"The harp-accompanied section of Giulietta's aria, ""O quante volte, quante"", sounds suspiciously like Desdemona's harp-accompanied Willow Song from ""Otello"". Even the introductory harp notes of the Bellini aria resemble the introductory harp notes of Rossini's aria! Shame on Bellini for copying Rossini!"
2,Item not as described.,"This item contains MANY small pieces. The item description says it includes a reusable storage pouch. It does not! Indeed, the activity card that comes as part of it, says it included a vinyl storage pouch. There is nothing for holding all the pieces other than the magnet boards, and the board that is meant for holding all the word magnets while you use the Word Wall Board is not big enough to hold all the magnets. The item may hold up for a single tutor using it for a single child, but this is not school quality. I would not recommend it for school use. I purchased this and the Word Families set and am disappointed that both came without a storage bag as described."
3,Works but falls off,This works well if it stays on. I've had it a while and I've had to put it back on 5 or 6 times. I won't get another one. I'll find something else or make something.
2,Mediocre,"In general, I don't like these clips. They let the seat belts get caught in the door. This one is an expensive piece of cheap plastic. That might be OK if it worked well. Unfortunately, I have to keep adjusting it on my 1999 Suburban because it slides out of position. My reason for buying it was that the shoulder belt was chafing the material on my sport coats. (My wife uses the Lupo on several of our cars to keep the shoulder harness off of her neck; I don't like the two-piece Lupo because it's always coming apart.)"
1,seatbelt clip retainer,"This product is not user friendly. Once you have attached to your seatbelt it's very difficult to adjust, but once you do adjust, when you unfasten your seatbelt to get out it does not allow the belt to roll up to get out of the way when closing the door. You will need to take it off the belt each time you get in and out of car which then becomes a hassle."
1,Hated this product,This did not work it kept coming unattached. Very frustrating. Dont bother ordering this product is doesn't work. The design is flawed I threw it in the trash.
1,INSTRUCTIONS,There were no installation instructions. I do not know if this product will forfill my expectations if I cannot figure out how to install. Please forward instructions.
2,diluted !,"I have used it before when i bought from the store. This one, ordered online, looks like at least 4 times diluted !! the good smell at the beginning is not strong enough, and doesn't last more than a couple of hours... I don't know, if this one I got had problem, or the supplier is ! I would rather buy it from the store, as I really liked swiss army. the 2nd star is for the nice packaging. bottle looks original though...!"
4,Best Modern Poetry!,This book of poems is the best I've read. It's cynical and taut at the same time.
1,Awful transfer,What is the point of Blue Ray and HD if the technology is wasted on this dreadful transfer? Extremely bad job. Don't buy it and vote with your pocket.
4,NOT QUITE THE GREATEST,"I FIRST SAW ""THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD "" AT THE WARNER CINERAMA IN NYC.IN 1965. IT WAS A MOVING FILM BUT THE AMERICAN WEST WHERE IT WAS FILMED WAS A BIG DISTRACTION TO ME. MAX VON SYDOW UNDERTOOK A VERY DIFFICULT ROLE SINCE EVERYONE HAS HIS OR HER OWN IDEA OF WHAT JESUS WAS LIKE. I FOUND THIS PERFORMANCE TO BE TOO SOMBER. JESUS HAD TO HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CHARISMATIC IF HE WERE TO ATTRACT FOLLOWERS. THIS JESUS DOESN'T FIT THE BILL. ALL DIVINITY AND VERY LITTLE HUMANITY. FOR ME THE MORE ACCURATE IMAGES OF JESUS,HUMAN AND DIVINE,CAN BE FOUND IN THE PORTRAYALS OF BRUCE MARCHIANO IN ""MATTHEW"" AND JEREMY SISTO IN THE NEWLY RELEASED MINISERIES ""JESUS."""
2,A product of its time,"I really hated giving this movie 2 stars. It had a lot of unrealized potential. From a scriptural perspective, I'd give it a C+. It got some things right, but a lot wrong or off. It did a good job with Lazarus (something most other movies skip), but a bad job with the disciples and the unscriptural representation of Simon of Cyrene carrying the cross.From a production perspective, it wasn't too bad but the timing of the movie is dated. Today we like faster paced action and the movie seems to plod along to modern tastes. In 1965 it may have been only a little slow.I've watched many of the Jesus related films that are out there. And my recommendation is to go with the one by Campus Crusades in 1977 (the Jesus film) or the Lawrence Olivier one (Jesus of Nazareth)."
3,I agree with some of the criticism,"My favorite thing about this film was Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. I thought he was great, but the rest of the characters, hmmm I don't know if they meant to potray the life of Christ that way. But I do agree the King of Kings was better and will always be my favorite film about Christ. But I also love Jesus of Nazareth."
3,it is ok,"Personally expected more, but that just me, others may enjoy this dvd more than I did. Short , brief but it brings the main points out."
5,A beautifully filmed movie,"This film isn't as accurate as ""Jesus of Nazareth"", but it's still worth watching. Max Von Sydow (pronounced Max von Sue-doff) is, I think, the best Jesus. The way they shot the movie is beautiful and very inspiring. I get chills up my arm every time Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. THe problem with this video, though, is that they focus on the major stars who only got teeny tiny roles, like John Wayne as the centurion, or Sydney Portier as Simon of cyrene. It tends to take the focus off of the main characters. The movie is also a bit choppy- a lot of scenes were cut. THe movie is really beautiful, though, and it's a wonderful movie to watch during Easter."
3,"Great movie, bad Blu-ray quality","This is a great classic but I was highly disappointed by the quality of the Blu-ray. I actually watched it side by side with its non-HD version and the latter was actually a better remastering.I would not recommend it, except that it is a great classic epic.LC"
1,How About Following Scripture??,"First of all, I'd like to say that I really like Max von Sydow as Jesus. He is very believable and he is a great actor (Jose Ferrer and Charlton Heston too).Unfortunatley, that is the only positive comment that I have to make. The direction and screenplay are terrible. What is so hard about consulting and following the story that the Word of God has to say? The true message is not told. Why not?I have not seen every Jesus movie, but I have seen quite a few. I highly recommend the ""Gospel of John"". I have watched it twice recently(the 3-hour version) and it is awesome. It was made in the same year(2004) as Mel Gibson's ""Passion"". If you are looking for a film that is true to scripture, watch ""The Gospel of John""."
1,HORRIBLE MESS DONT BUY THIS BLU-RAY,An Ultra Panavision 70 mm Film Should Have Ben A Perfect Source Material For A Stunning High Definition Transfer Instead What Do We Get This Worthless Material Now Get This Line Regarding Print Please Not That Negatives From Most United Artist Films are Long Gone Then Why not State This Fact Before We Purchase This item an Why Transfer it To Blu-ray? I'm Sick of hearing Somewhat of an Improvement over Previous DVD Release That is not What High Definition Transfer Was meant To Be. I For One is Going To Ask For a Refund.
2,Unbiblical and pretentious,"No wonder this movie was a flop when it was released. It is pretentious and makes up its own story line instead of following any of the Gospel stories. It has events all out of sequence or distorted. Lots of shots of Arizona hills and gullies - pretty boring before long. Of all the modern movies about Jesus, this is definitely the worst. Try ""Jesus of Nazareth"" for beauty and drama combined."
4,I wish the BD would have GRAIN,"This review is not about the film, but about the transfer to Blu-Ray disc. 5 stars for the film. 2 stars for the transfer. I love classic movies and I hate digital manipulation of the scanned film elements, like the sick degraining of most classic features. If the sometimes distracting noise other reviewers complained about, would be real film grain, I would be more than happy with that! But it is NOT grain, it is video noise and that's a shame for MGM/FOX. They simply recycled an old film to tape transfer and avoided the cost to perform a new state-of-the-art 4k scan of the best available elements. That's just it."
3,Not the worst blu ray transfer but............,"I have just started to watch my copy of the Greatest Story ever told and after watching the Ten Commandments and King of Kings I am a little disappointed..........it isn't the worst transfer I have seen on blu ray, Django holds that dubious honour and is now an over priced coaster.ten Commandments and King of Kings show how older films can look on HD, The transfer hasn't put me off watching this lovely film, but please be aware the upgrade from DVD isn't that great, please please do not let once upon a time in the west or Ben Hur when they come out be a disappointment.I have given this release 3 stars for the movie and not the quality of the Blu Ray, I am still glad I have this movie but after watching King of Kings.......it feels like a wasted opportunity.As we will probably never get these biblical releases over here in the UK I am still happy with my purchase."
3,"Good, but not ""The Greatest""","This movie was good, no doubt about it. Very well produced and directed. GREAT cinematography. I appreciated the actors portrayal of Christ. It was a very divine portrayal. The movie is VERY reflective of Scripture and so I am surprised by some of the liberties taken by the producer. The form of Judas' suicide is certainly the most obvious liberty because it is indeed a contradiction of Canonical Gospels. The 4 Gospels are very short books - hardly screenplays - and yet the movie leaves out so many important details that are given in these books. Of the liberties taken to make this movie, I am very APPRECIATIVE that nearly all of the violence against Christ was left out of this movie. As a result of this fine production decision, I can watch this movie with my children. This is a very good movie, but it is definately not ""The Greatest""."
2,Easily the worst blu ray release,"A complete deception, the graininess is so visible and distracting. This is the worst blu-ray release I ever seen. Very bad restoration work, nothing comparable to ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""King of Kings""."
5,the greatest story told,"this is true they realy put alot of effort into this movie. i mean they really poured their hearts into thier parts.i think this movie is pretty good as far as the production as the years go.it is old but it is still a classic! even though the actor who played jesus had more of a french accent i think he did a good job.but people are right i mean put some joy into jesus life i mean it couldnt so boring at time i mean put some fear in to those hearts and give me some tounges of fire!! you know the whole production,give more sadness and joy into the character i dint mean be stuck up or carefree but you know like us the people ! not so godly.. not to be rude but they always use jesus as a strict godlike person! no joy no sadness like some actors doo. just boring and i think that this movis adds some of that into the script,tha carrying of his cross was not rushed so it had some affect on people even sheded some tears.. but above all it was good no it was GREAT!!"
3,good looking slow moving,"This film moves like a procession through aisles of dogma. Deliberate, conservative, lovely, austere: the images go by like a series of Greek Orthodox icons. As attractive as they are, the landscapes of Utah and Nevada create the anticipaton that an Indian war party could swoop down at any moment. And after two hours in the old west, the voice of John Wayne seems quite appropriate. Unfortunately the use of Handel's Hallalujah chorus seems highly inappropriate. In an otherwise modern score, the use of this baroque period oratorio is almost comical. A film like this would look great as a series of stained glass windows in a church. But for sheer inspiration and dramatic impact, it doesn't compare with the Passion of Christ, the Gospel of John or even Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth."
3,"Reverant, but dull.","Two Jesus film epics in one decade? I can't believe it! 1965's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" followed 1961's ""King Of King's"" with a charismatic performance by Max von Sydow. The film has less of the historical backdrop and plot augmentations as it's predecessor, and seems to aspire towards a more pious adherence to the Gospels (a couple reviews disagreed with that assessment, which surprised me). The shots are more beautiful in my opinion, but I'm not a film major so don't take my word for it. The film seems to lack passion though. It just doesn't move me. The cameos are excessive. Hollywood emphasises stars over acting. What's new? I personally prefer ""King Of Kings"" over this, but I think they're about equal in terms of quality. You be the judge."
4,Wonderful movie,"Great movie, could have been a bit longer for my taste, but great none the less. It is the greatest story, as we now have our Savior to help us."
1,a terrible movie,Amazon should refund my money - this movie is NOT GOOD! After watching the first 45 minutes of the movie we decided to fast forward the movie to 'what had to be the good parts' - there were none.
1,MUSIC TOO LOUD,"I ORDERED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ABOUT THE LIFE OF CHRIST. THE RECREATION OF THIS MOVIE ON DVD IS HORRENDOUS. THE PICTURE IS GRAINY AND THE MUSIC SO LOUD AS TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THE DIALOGUE. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS IS A WIDE SCREEN VERSION OF THE MOVIE AND IT FILLS UP ONLY THE CENTER ONE THIRD OF THE SCREEN MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE. THERE WERE SO MANY DARKLY LIT SCENES I COULDNT MAKE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE DIALOGUE I COULD HEAR SOUNDED MUFFLED, OR UNCLEAR, SO I FIGURED I'D PUT THE SUBTITLES ON THE SCREEN. NO LUCK WITH THIS EITHER, THE SUBTITLES ARE ONLY IN SPANISH AND FRENCH, NEITHER OF WHICH I SPEAK. SO TO SAY THIS WAS A TERRIBLE REPRODUCTION OF THIS MOVIE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."
3,The Greatest Story Ever Told,"This movie went away from what the bible actually says about Mary Magdelene. This movie showed Mary Magdelene as the adulterous whom the Jews wanted to throw stones for her act. Mary Magdelene was possessed by seven devils of which Jesus exercised and was not the adulterous depicted in the bible.. If you want the story of Jesus that sticks mostly to what the bible says, then Jesus of Nazareth is your best bet."
2,I enjoy most Religious Movies Not this One,This movie put me to sleep. The actor who played Jesus looked and acted boring. Was not playing the part as I was not inspired how he would be. Just my opinion. It was not catching my attention. And it was slow. The lighting in this movies was like it was done on dark days.
1,Zzzzzzzz,"Incredibly static and boring and too long,the direction and the actors are very flat,you may see king of kings it's much better."
1,Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do...,"A classic example of overblown insensitive Hollywood biblical-epic filmaking. Unlike the sensitively told and awe-inspiring King Of Kings, TGSET is an overlong and unmoving experience for the viewer from start to finish, from it's corny cinematography (which makes the movie look like a Hallmark greeting card come to life) to it's unbelievably crass casting, including Pat Boone, Shelly Winters, and most notoriously John Wayne as a Roman soldier(""this truly was the son of Gaawd!""). Among all the hammy scenery-chewing acting, the only person to really shine is the wonderful Max Von Sydow who sensitively attempts to portray Jesus, though his Swedish accent kind of ruins everything. Film fans would be much better off buying King Of Kings or The Gospel According To Matthew."
1,Region problems,"When I purchased this dvd everything was in english. I could'nt for the life of me understand how I am supposed to be okay with a dvd that does'nt play on none of my dvd players . I can only watch it if I change the region code on my computer,and even that you can't do but so many times. I am not pleased at all."
1,The Ultimate Case Where the Book is Better,"Do not pick up your New Testament & follow along with this movie, the characterizations & plot move in & out of biblical history that I stop watching the movie 3 times without ever finishing the movie. Then again; we all know how the movie ""Should"" end. Maybe better written: How can you make a movie called ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" while changing the plot of the greatest story ever told?"
1,the greatest story ever told,"this is the worst, most biblically incorrect, boringness movie I have ever watched. I mean, not one scene was portrayed correctly; from Jesus being baptized to his picking of his disciples, the woman caught is adultery, the wilderness of 40 years , Saul not being converted to Paul after the resurrection, raising Lazarus, and many more. There were several scenes where the actors were striking a pose, meaning they didn't move as if they were frozen when they were being filmed. Horrible move. It even loaded slow to the point that I thought is was damaged. The only good thing is that I bought it online with Amazon."
4,"a decent, moving movie","It was a great movie, with a great list of actors, Max Von Sydow, Charleston Heston, to name a few. Some of it wasnt very biblical, and they could have put some special effects in and more miricles, but all in all it was a very good movie, rent it first though before you buy. :) God Bless"
4,I have always loved this movie...,"I've always loved this movie. However, it is a shame that even after purchasing, then downloading for 4 hours, that Amazon Video has to buffer every other second."
3,Loved the movie.,"The Re-Make made it Soo Bad(Picture quality wise!). I thought Blu-Ay would enhance it,but instead instead it too so much away. Made it look like it was filmed on a ""Super 8"" camera from the 70's & 80's. I was watching it on a 50"" LED 1080p 120ghz TV btw."
5,great size with everything you could need,"This is a great book to take when you travel as it fits easily in any bag. There are phrases for pretty much any topic you would need to discuss and the layout makes it easy to find what you need. Plus, if you can't read Tibetan, there is phonetic pronunciation next to it all. I also love having the English-Tibetan dictionary in the back."
3,TIBETAN PHRASE BOOK,MY PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE TIBETAN PHRASE BOOK. THE POST OFFICE IS TRYING TO TRACE IT. THIS IS OF CONCERN TO ME. ANY HELP FROM YOU WOULD BE APPRECIATED. HOW CAN I RATE SOMETHING I HAVE NOT RECEIVED.
3,I was a waitress,"This job is interesting enough to write a book about. It is physically, emotionally, and mentally demanding, it sometimes pays off and other times does not. You interact with a lot of people because of all the customers and the co-workers."
2,"Not ""Kitchen Confidential"" (not even close!)","I had great expectations for this book--specifically, to see what the world of waiting is like from the inside, as I have never waited tables. After the first 50 pages, the novelty of my newly-aquired knowledge of restaurant drama wore off.From the very beginning, I found Debra Ginsburg's writing sophomoric. I was irritated by her overuse of adverbs (especially ""truly"").I also didn't find much in the way of character development. She never gave the reader so much as a hint of other interests.I was expecting something amazing like ""Kitchen Confidential"". I agree with the reviewer who stated that this author bit off more than she can chew."
3,A perfect read for someone who has never waited tables,I hate to give this book 3 stars simply because I related to it so much. That is because I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 20 years myself. So I found this book to be exactly what I know already and therefore somewhat boring.The writer does make some great points about the industry however. I believe anyone who has never worked in a restaurant would definately find this book entertaining.
3,"Worth a Read, but not necessary worth reading Twice","Easy to read and understand with situations that will have all of those in the service industry nodding their heads. Kudos to the author on her publication. On a down side, I felt the book was too personal to the author's life and tended to read like her autobiography (biography?). I was looking for more generalized situations and funny stories and less about her life."
3,More bio than tell-all,"I was looking for lots of juicy stories about the waitressing and restaurant business, along with tips about eating in restaurants. There was a lot of that, but much more was devoted to the life story of the author. Mostly interesting, but not what I was expecting."
4,A Delightful Read!,"""Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress"" by Debra Ginsberg is a real treat. You're lucky enough to get inside the head of a wonderfully funny and creative woman. Her writings of life as a waitress are a real departure for a ""fiction"" reader like myself, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was laugh out loud funny and so easy to identify with. I mean, we all visit restaurants and, probably have worked in food service at one point or another. I think it's a situation that many people can see themselves in. A great book, with a funny and witty take on life. I think you'll enjoy it!"
4,An entertaining look at the industry,"If you have never worked in the restaurant field, you are sure to find this book entertaining with the colorful people Debra encounters through 20 years of waiting on table.If you have worked in the industry, as I have, as a waiter, cook, bartender and now manager, you are sure to be able to relate with Debra's experiences. One I started reading, I found it hard to put the book down.Several times I laughed out loud as one of her recollections prompted me to recall an experience of my own, be it a colorful co-worker, or a guest that either made my night, or made my night an unbelievable problem.She has shown that waiting tables is not just a job, it's an adventure."
3,"Amusing at times, but too long-winded.","""Waiting"" contains some interesting behind-the-scenes anecdotes about the restaurant business. However, the book should have been edited down to about half its length. I was really struggling to get through the last 50 pages or so. Parts of the book could have been eliminated altogether, like the chapter about cinematic portrayals of waitresses."
2,Negative and a bit whiny,"While the author claims to like her work as a waitress, enjoys the flexibility and money, the book is full of complaints about restaurant managers, cooks and customers. And the story wanders in many places; she may be telling a story about a current and yet again unsatisfactory job and start talking about something unrelated and then come back to the present. My head was swimming. There is an undertone of indignation through out the story. I did develop a great appreciation of wait staff, however and do realize how hard they work."
2,Not Worth the Wait,"I was disappointed in this book. As a former waitress myself, I found this book devoid of the true essence and excitement of working in the restaurant industry. There are missed opportunities to go into detail about colleagues or customers and pull the reader deeper into her tale. Instead, the book is a mishmash of people and places that never build a connection compelling enough to want to read on. The book's only ""true confession"" is that Ms. Ginsberg does not have a very high opinion of her profession or her customers."
3,leave a little above average tip,"I really found the premise of this book interesting. And the author has really paid her dues in the food service department. She has that great cynical waitresses humour which can be the best on the planet but is also a little impersonal. Her experience is varied and she portrays it all with a very knowledgable voice. But it is the voice of a toughened heart who has learned to keep a functional, friendly yet guarded smile on her face.Having been a waitress myself, I know there are a lot of mixed feelings to being a part of this family. It feels like she just doesn't trust you enough to tell you how she really feels about her place in the 'food chain'.But, it is really a fun read and you'll really appreciate it if you have ever served a dinner to anyone ever in your life."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"As a server myself, I often think that EVERYONE should wait tables at least once in their lives. And, they should NEED the money because that makes all of the difference in the world. On the same note, I think that EVERYONE should read this book; make it required reading in the schools! Ms. Ginsberg touched so humorously on all of the aspects of the restaurant industry; the affairs, the money, the customers...I enjoyed this book tremendously. Get it! You won't be disappointed."
5,Amazingly funny and completely true!,"Of course, I'm a waitress, so I can relate to Ginsberg's feelings from dealing with bad tippers and rude guests, to that one table that smiles at you and makes your night go by so much easier. It's a tricky job because every guests wants personalized service, but everyone is different! It's just unfortunate that those who really should read the book are those who will probably see Ginsberg as a complainer! Not many people realize how difficult being a foodserver really is - but anyone lucky enough to serve someone who has read this book will be thankful - it really gets under the surface and explains what goes on in our heads during every shift! Since not everyone has to put in their time wearing the apron, everyone should have to read this book, just to get a taste..."
3,Waiting review,"Overall good book. Wish she would have written a little more about actual waiting situations but, it was still worth it for the couple situations she did write about."
1,The negative reviews are quite accurate...,"One of the basic axioms of a writer is ""Don't tell me, show me."" Don't say you're funny. Don't say you can write well. And don't say you have an insight to the basic human experience. Especially when you don't.There was an opportunity for some good stories in this book, and Ginsburg may be a good observor of human nature, but her writing is not particularly compelling and the stories don't grab you."
3,Lacks pizazz,"About: Ginsberg describes her long career as a waitress in restaurants ranging from her family's luncheonette to a country club. Plenty of vignettes about ill-behaved restaurant staff and customers here.Pros: The tales and interpersonal relationships she describes on the job can be amusingCons: I read this book after reading Waiter Rant: Thanks for the Tip--Confessions of a Cynical Waiter and found that Ginsberg's work paled in comparison. The chapter on waitressing in the media seemed like a tacked on writing class assignment, and her style lacked any ""oomph"" to hold my interest."
2,I'm sorry to disagree,... I found the book quite boring. I was hoping for some funny stories and perhaps some perspective on what we can do to make a servers life a little more pleasant and avoid some of those nasty misunderstandings that can lead to mutual unhappiness on both sides. Instead I found myself suffering through a life story that did not interest me in the slightest. Avoid this book if you were hoping she would just stick to talking about the job.
1,The most unfulfilling of meals,"I can't understand why this book was published. There are so many good books in this genre (try ""Tender at the Bone"" or the restaurant chapter of ""Saturday Night,"" for example), why publish one that has nothing going for it? The author has no mastery over the use of description, there's no detail about the places, the characters, the work, even her experiences. it's a quick, easy read, but like fast-food, you aren;t so happy when you're finished."
5,If You've Even Been a Waitress....,"...then you'll totally ""get"" this book! I love Ms. Ginsberg's upbeat attitude and the fact that she loves her job. She's so right that most people talk about waitresses like they're lower on the job chain than prostitutes when nothing could be further from the truth. As eating out seems to be a national past time, you'd think waitresses would be revered right up there with football heros! Just try to imagine life without them. I like the way she integrated statistics about the job and interwove threads of her life story into it; it was very interesting and enlightening. To those of you who gave bad reviews, this is not a novel, for heaven's sake, it's a memoir and a very well written one at that!"
1,Thank Goodness She Has a Day Job,"Quite simply, the extent to which this book reeks is astonishing. Debra Ginsberg, should be slapped in the face with leather gloves for ever thinking she was entitled to put pen to paper. Not until the last chapter does she realize that her life has been without consequence. I could have told her that after reading the first couple of pages. Do yourself a favor: If you're in need of some good waitress stories, go get yourself a job at a local restaurant. You have my guarantee that your experiences will be better than the slop Ginsberg slings. Her writing, full of cliché and nothingness, is unforgivable. Even the most casual reader can play a remarkably crowded game of connect-the-dots with her use of the word ""singularly."" Well, Debra Ginsberg has written history's singularly most unimportant book."
1,hello?,"I have worked in restaurants for more than 10 years. This book is a big pile of steaming monkey poo. A fairy tale book complete with a happy ending. This is not at all what waiting tables is. I appreciated some of her clever quips, but for the most part I felt cheated as a waiter. For a true confessions of a waiter go to clamchowder.biz and buy Clam Chowder: the Server's Field Manual. You'll laugh, crym and feel relieved that finally someone has done an honest job."
3,I already wrote this book.,"I published a book entitled ""Waiting"" in 1996 with Viking/Penguin. It is an oral history about waiting tables and it did moderately well. Alas, the first one to the market never wins. I am happy to see that someone is making some money from my idea. Kudos!-Bruce Henderson"
1,An Insult to the Industry,"I stopped reading the book when the subject of tipping came about and Mrs. Debra's started her litany about the fact that 100% of any received tip should go integrally to her pocket.When we in Europe go to Restaurants, it is the complete experience that interests us, the atmosphere, the food served, the reputation of the restaurant. Waiters should be invisible and are part of that experience. If and when we tip, the tip is for all of those who contributed to the experience.Everytime I am in America, I am frustrated by waiters asking how I am doing and comment on my tie.I thought the book was going to give me an insight of a certain part of the industry. It does not achieve that goal unfortunately."
3,i WAS WAITING FOR WAITING...,I really wanted to love this book and forced myself to finish it. Its slow and some chapters are long and drawn out. Debra the author is a likeable person and seems to have had a hard life of finding real love. I had no idea what the book was about when i bought it. I have never waited tables or gotten to know anyone that served me in a resturant. I did learn quite a bit about the work in general and how hard it really is behind the scenes. Also learned how we take people for granted that wait on us...So I will keep that in mind from now on. Thanks Debra
4,Fun and interesting,"Liked most of this book. A little too philosophical in parts. Dragged a bit in places but great fun when she describes personalities of customers, staff and chefs."
5,Couln't wait to read this book!!,"I read it over the weekend! Why? I just couldn't put it down. Great writer! Was so absorbing that, when the phone rang I was startled back to real life! Debra Ginsbergs' true life store is well worth reading. Very informative on a profession I knew little about; however, I have long ago tipped big thinking that the people who serve deserve! This is an excellent book!"
2,Waiting...for the Novel to End,"Seemingly the only negative review of this book, I am dissapointed with Ginsberg for promising a ""lively and insightful look into restaurants"" and delivering quite the opposite. Claiming to be part social commentary, part ettiquette guide, and part memoir, this book bit of more than it can chew and ends up to be a rambling no-direction three hundred pages. From a literary point of view, the writing is simple and there is an abundance of cliches and kitchy, 'witty' comments with the use of the word 'waiting'. Ginsberg does provide some positive, and occasionally laughable perspectives of waitressing, but Waiting is simply a good concept with poor execution."
4,Well written & interesting,"I thought this book gave food for thought. A littl pun there. Nevertheless, I found this book to be very entertaining, and I don't think I will be sending any food back."
3,Good Reading,"I've only held two waitressing jobs and I got canned from both of them. I by no means think I could ever wait on tables: I'm not built for it. That doesn't mean I'm not intelligent or agile, it just takes a special kind of person.This book is easy-to-read, very enjoyable and informative. Ginsberg's got some powerful insights on life, too, which hit me in the gut.For anyone who has ever waited on tables, or not."
3,Cute story,"Kind of an inside look at people we sometimes don't really ""see"". Hard working and conscientious she forces you to pay attention to those who serve you."
4,Interesting Book,"I read this book in bits and pieces; it's the kind of book that you want to savor and enjoy instead of just reading it through. I especially enjoyed her tales of waitressing. The only reason I gave it four stars is because at times it became bogged down with her personal life. All in all, it's well written and a good read."
2,Meh..,"Some interesting restaurant stories, but while she spends a lot of time saying that she has no problem being a waitress, she spends even more time saying she's really a writer. I wanted some funny/awful/sweet stories of things that happened in the restaurant, not a psychosocial treatise on the lot of the single working mother. For that we have Barbara Ehrenreich."
5,Eating with Debra Ginsberg !,"Memoirs are one of my favorite forms of prose. Debra Ginsberg wrote one of the very best I have ever read---full of fascinating stories of all the various experiences she had during her lifetime as a waitress. She has an uncanny way of writing each chapter as if you were right there, watching, waiting and hoping she has a good night. Will this party of six leave a sufficient tip ? Will this chef be cooperative ? Are her co-workers helpful and friendly or do they make her work more difficult ? Each group of diners really creates a story of its own. The book reads easily--Debra Ginsberg is an excellent writer. You will not want to put this book down, that is for sure."
4,Enjoyable reading,"I worked as a waitress in the past and shared some of my ""days of slinging hash"" stories with my husband. I picked up this book after reading an excerpt from the center. I figure if a book gets my interest in the middle - it will have it from beginning to end. This book did not disappoint me as it lived up to my expectations.I laughed through personal collection of stories and events beyond her control - shared with tips of insight to why some of these occur and just how out of control of the ""front floor"" a waitress can be. I nodded my head in understanding at the same time.My husband read the book and said he could now understand better my personal horror stories of those days - so even an outsider to the ""biz"" can benefit and gain some insight to the serving life. He laughed at her recounts as well, so one does not need to have had a past as a server to enjoy the humor in this book."
4,A Solid Effort.....Maybe 4.4 Stars,"Like the title says, this is solid effort. Ginsberg is much more polished than Anthony Bourdain. Not so shock value-oriented, either.For me, FINE DINING MADNESS (by J. Galloway) is the champ as far as restaurant books go. Very funny, and gutsy. ""Heat""is a three star book, but comes off a little phony."
4,Excellent? Maybe. Very Good? Yes!,"Having worked as a dishwasher, I believe most of what she has written without question. The cooks (I never worked anywhere that had actual ""chefs"") had attitude for sure. Two waitresses feuding? Get OUT of the line-of-fire ASAP! I wish she'd addressed my pet peeve of servers who say ""I have (a special chianti, prime filet mignon, etc.) tonight ..."" It's ""we"" not ""I"" but anyway ... I recommend this one. It's as entertaining, and informative, as others have posted. The earring trick was neat to know."
3,Excellent movie but not for family,"I loved the orginal release. However, even though this directors cut has a lot more interesting scenes which are definely a plus, the nudity scene that was included completely prevents this from being a family experience. Just dont understand why it had to be included."
1,Academy Award Should Be Repossessed,"If you liked the original, this ""director's cut"" should be avoided. For starters, why not include the original theatrical release on the Blu-ray??? Give me a break. At least I would have been able to salvage the disc. Seriously, it wasn't good enough to win the academy award; why re-edit it? None of the extra footage added anything to the movie on any level. It was just a wasted effort.....a total disappointment. Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Amadeus,"With the VHS (video) version, the story is more complete in the sense that you see the whole story as it was originally portrayed in the movie. The DVD cuts the story short in the sense that it ends with the requiem.The company manufacturing the DVDs should inform customers in advance that in order to get the whole story as seen in the movies, they (the customers) must purchase more than one DVD. Or did I miss something?"
1,The lowest video quality you could find on a DVD,"I live in france and the only solution i had to have this film was to buy the Zone 1 version. U couldn't imagine how deep my deception was. It was impossible to focus, the picture seems to be filtred like in the worse david Hamilton's film. To complete, the disc is two sided and nothing aware you at the end of the first side. I suggest you to buy the CD and to close your eyes to see the film"
1,"Great Movie,Bad DVD","I have the DVD version of this movie. I am not into classical music,but I did enjoy this movie. I gave it 4 stars,..but I take one away becasue I have to ""FLIP"" the dang disc over to finish it. Whats up with that Warner Brothers. You guys did the same with ""The Color Purple!"". Two classic movies on DVD,..and you have to flip them over in the year 2001. What a bummer."
3,Nice movie,"I had no problems at all with my copy of this DVD. Judging from another review, however, there are bad copies out there so don't be afraid of the return policy. They must have done multiple printings of the disk because my movie is entirely on one side, not two sided as others have said.Anyway, the movie itself is enjoyable, the score is beautiful, Tom Hulce and F Murray Abraham give nice performances, and the visuals are nice. This movie is much more fun when you view Mozart as he would be in modern times: The most outrageous rock and roll icon of our time. When you compare his life to that of some of our own musical legends that died young, you see a lot of parallels, and to me, that makes the character much easier to identify, and therefore sympathize, with."
4,Excellent!,"Aside from the many factual inaccuracies, I enjoyed this film! The opera scenes are breathtaking, and that casting was very well done. Salieri was played out well, calm, cool, but always plotting, and Mozart and his bufoonish laugh...It really brought out the point that genius can be held in the most unlikely places. Bravo!"
4,Buy the original theatrical release,"I love ""Amadeus"" and consider it one of the best movies of all time. However, the director's cut makes the movie feel too long without adding substantially to the story. Yes, it does ""flesh out a couple of small subplots and shed new light on certain key scenes"". But this clarity comes at a cost to the overall tempo and feel of the movie.I'm also one who believes that we don't need to know everything (think about the suitcase in ""Pulp Fiction""). By giving just a hint rather than fleshing out the details, a filmmaker leaves room for the imagination of the viewer, which can make a film more satisfying in the end."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"Even though I typically only watch The Director's Cut of this film, this version is still good to have. For one, it's the original theatrical cut of the movie that was released back in 1984, second, it has a feature that the two-disc director's cut does not have: an optional isolated music-only track that plays along with the film. It's great because it features music that has never been included on any of the various soundtrack album permutations that have been released over the years.Now, if Warner Bros. would just hurry up and blu-ray this sucker, everything will be good."
2,Theatrical Cut Please!!!,"I know we're all addicted to the idea of Director's Cut is far better than theatrical cut, Amadeus is not one of those movies(Dances with Wolves is another disaster). It was truly a great movie as it was. So please don't deprive us with this Director's Cut only! Give us theatrical cut or at least give us both version release."
2,Reductive,"I'm doing a term paper on Mozart for an elective course, and I must say, the film ""Amadeus"" is so far from fact that I couldn't really enjoy it. Just don't watch it thinking you're going to learn much of who Mozart really was.He and his wife produced six children, for example - the movie shows only one. Wouldn't the death of 4 of his kids in infancy made him slightly less chipper?Of course I loved the snippets of music; who wouldn't? But it was more like a smooth melding of ""Greatest Hits Melodies"" than a chance to really get into his music.Can someone recommend - can someone MAKE - a movie that really does Mozart justice?This movie is really a Johnny One Note."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,The dvd played a picture with NO sound! I never received a refund. I never received a call back or email or anything. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,Not Good,Great disappointment - Movie has NO SOUND - This was Xmas present for my Dad!!! Now too late to re-order. Not happy at all!!!
1,"wrong regional code, no subtitling","I didn't get a region-2 version of the dvd that I'd ordered, so the item was useless to me. Moreover the copy didn't contain Dutch subtitles, so I really wonder what I'd ever again buy at Amazon. I was flabberghasted to see that it was possible to make even two fatal mistakes in just one very simple order like this. Ridiculous.Bye bye, Amazon."
1,Audio did not work,"Picture was fine, music was able to be heard but no dialogue. Product returned but had to pay for postage so lost money."
5,Thrilling!,"Awesome. I saw this in a theater when it first came out, and I've seen it numerous times since then. And each time I seriously lose myself in the beauty of it all. The music is excellent--of course I love all of Mozart's works--I mean, the way it is woven into the story...I especially love the part when Salieri so passionately describes Serenade No. 10 in B-Flat Major (Serenade for the Winds)... F. Murray Abraham (Salieri) and Tom Hulce (Mozart) are truly amazing--their passion is breathtaking! What can I say? I love love this movie! Oh, and this film isn't historically accurate, but it was never meant to be--in case you're wondering."
5,Wonderful movie......,"In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made. The acting and the music by far are wonderful.When seeing this movie for the first time when I was 15, it gave me a new interest in learning about that divinely talented man, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."
2,Very disappointed in the DVD - better to buy the Video,"Amadeus is one of my all time favorites. Wonderful costumes, sets, and acting. I own the video but purchased the DVD for improved picture quality. What a mistake. There was no improvement in picture quality and the movie is cut in half, one half on each side of the disk. I can't recommend this DVD, buy the video instead."
5,original is way better!,"im sorry to say but the original cut is perfect.the added scences break the rythem and the ""fast"" editing of the original, and add questionabale information.an original track should have been given as an option on the dvd.soundwise, it sounds like a better copy, very good anyway.this movie is a gem either case, ive seen it over and over.directors cuts arent allways a good thing."
5,Great Movie About Mozart,"Nominated for 11 academy awards, including the two lead actors. Own 8 awards. Very interesting plot. Excellent music by a musical genius. Kept me riveted the entire movie, and the actors kept you emotionally involved with them."
5,Amadeus,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, enjoyed it, and had forgotten about it..... until I went to the Musical Instrument Museum and saw a clip from the movie in one of the displays. I was pleased to find a new copy of Amadeus through Amazon.I watched it immediately and was not disappointed - Great film!"
5,Excellent Movie!,"This was a movie which was so entertaining from start to finish. It was funny and the music is so entertaining. If you love the music from Mozart, this will be the movie to watch!"
5,The legend of Mozart,"Although this film takes great factual liberties, it succeeds in bringing to life the spirit and genuis of a stunningly brilliant human being. A life as dense and productive as Mozarts is almost impossible to bring to film, yet director Milos Forman manages to condense the expanse of Mozart's accomplishments into a production that rivets the attention of the audience. The almost magical intrigue that surrounds Mozarts life and death is captured with the theatrical and dramatic impact that would be expected from such an extraordinary life. This is one of those rare films that can be viewed more than just a few times. Mozarts music soars througout the film with the brilliant direction of Sir Neville Marriner."
1,Profound disappointment,"When I bought this DVD I thought I was buying the whole movie of Amadeus as I remember it from 1984. Instead the original movie was cut drastically, and many scenes I remember, including sample scenes from Mozart's operas, especially Don Giovanni, were missing, and only the bare bones of Salieri's ""plot"" was depicted.Please tell me, what happened to the rest of the movie?Or did I miss something?I tried the various options on the opening menu and could find no evidence that any more footage from the original, other than what I saw, was on the DVD. If I am wrong I would gladly keep the DVD."
2,A Cinematic Failure,"Based on the superior and intellectually taunt stage play, the film version of Amadeus boasts an exceptional performance by Abraham, remarkable art direction and costume design, and a fascinating glimpse into the Austrian court. Unfortunately, it is also riddled with enough minor annoyances to completely undercut these virtues. Chief among these annoyances is an extensive dilution of the original play's theme, which is generally trashed in favor of a more soap opera-ish focus. Another significant annoyance is the wild disparity in accents used by the actors in the film, with Hulce a prime example; his otherwise interesting performance is significantly hampered by a determinedly modern American accent, a circumstance which makes it difficult to accept him in the title role. At best, Amadeus is an interesting failure; at worst, it is an example of a brilliant play watered down to appeal to the lowest common denominator of popular taste."
2,What&#65533;s all the fuss about?,"I fell prey to a deception: Academy Award: Best Picture, Produced by: Saul Zaentz. In this case, that combination was hardly worth the paper on which it was printed.I knew little about the life of Mozart when I started watching, and knew little more upon completion. Sure it's lavish, and sure it's grand, and it is fun. Maybe too many caricatures, not enough reality? I can't imagine the finished product is the film they set out to make.Don't get me wrong. It's not the responsibility of every historical film to educate, but usually a certain amount of education comes with the territory. Here it is all a la carte I am saddened to say.This film hardly stands in there with many of the Best Picture winners, but it is by no means the bottom of the heap either.On to the next."
2,"Manic, Ultimately Flat","Great sets and costumes don't redeem almost three hours of enduring a muddled screenplay and poor, often over-the-top, acting by the protagonist and others. A promising beginning deteriorated steadily to a point where I was ready to bail out but somehow stuck with it.I decided to try this after getting into Mozart the last couple of years. I thought at the least the score would be good. But instead of his concertos, symphonies, and serenades, we get his unfamiliar (to me) operas.A perfect example of Hollywood rewarding the lushness of the production despite a tiresome (and historically inaccurate) story line."
5,New edition of Amadeus = new rating from MPAA,"Due to Constanza Mozart briefly baring her breasts while Salieri blackmailed her, the MPAA in its infinite and irrational wisdom changed the original rating of Amadeus from PG to ""R"".This action makes absolutely no sense for in the treatment of this wonderful acted film. This re-rating makes it off limits for high schools to present to students. Yet crude movies with lewd dialogue like ""Goldmember"" rejoices in its PG-13 universal access. This doesn't make any sense!!!! ""American Pie"" had brief nudity and a lot more objectionable verbage along with a lot of other movies aimed at teenagers and even young children.I just don't get this at all. Would a representative from MPAA please step up and explain your ""logic""???? It would be greatly appreciated."
3,"10 stars for the movie, 1 star for this version","I'm not the only one here who adores this film, so I'm not sure why so many people are raving about an extra 20 minutes added to a perfectly structured film. So we get some more background on minor subplots--so? It was enough for me to know that Mozart was irresponsible, that he had no students, and that Constanze resented Salieri because he refused to help Mozart get a court position. I didn't need to see this dragged-out, talky extra footage reiterating how jealous Salieri is, how childish Mozart is, and the ""new"" portrayal of Constanze is totally non-credible and offensive. Much of the new footage clashes with characterization at other points in the film, and all three major characters end up less likable as a result. At least they spared us more ""background details"" such as where he bought his shoes, etc."
2,dvd did not work,"the only sound that came thru was the backround music, no audio. this was the second time i ordered this dvd and and i think i got the same dvd back because i had the same problem. i sent them both back. its not my player because i've ordered other movies from amazon and they work."
3,This movie is a classic,"I purchased the DVD because I never tire of watching this movie. The quality of the DVD is not up to par and it is on two sides. Beware of the return policy. Had I known you could not return the disc once it's been opened, I would not have purchased the movie."
2,don't get this version,"This is much longer than what you saw in the theater and what's added is not very good. Also, I was ""streaming"" (I guess that's the word, I don't know) it - my computer was connected to the internet and also to an external monitor which has pretty good quality usually and the sharpness really sucked. It was quite disappointing and not at all what i remember from seeing it on the big screen. There is still a lot of good material - well, great material - but the overall package detracts majorly."
3,Amadeus Bluray,it's good for digibook .. but very bad for picture. Transfer picture like DVD .. so sad nice packaging but bad picture. i buy it because it's cheap and also includes CD .. it's fair to me. if u dont have this edition .. thinking twice ..
3,Not Quite There... Get Director's Cut Instead!,"I saw the Director's Cut version in the theaters years ago and it's well worth the ticket price. The Director's Cut version fills in LOTS of things that happen in the film and the original 1987 version compared is very general and not as interesting after seeing the Director's Cut version. I give it four stars because the acting is good, great story, 2nd disc Making of..., and I love W.A. Mozart. Get the Director's Cut is all I say!"
5,Don't like opera? Think again...,"I saw this title mainly because I've always liked Mozart's non-vocal music, but this title broadened my horizons. I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks that they *might* like classical music but never got over all the confusing details. The acting is superb, the setting is exceptional, and the story is well told by ""Salieri"". The director, Forman, also did ""Cuckoo's Nest"", and it's almost as good as that classic. You owe it toyourself to have this in you collection, even if you aren't a fan of classical music. One caveat: many copies appear to be flippers, but it's a small price to pay."
3,A slight letdown,"A love the movie Amadeus. The music is superb! The scenes, costuming and historical rendering a superb! The choice of actors and screen writing a superb. However, in this rendition it is my opinion that the added scenes distract from the story. Some of them are good, adding details to the story. However, the partial nude scene of Mozart's wife did nothing. Other sections perforated the original rendition. The Blu-ray was great HD movie watching. However, the added scenes spoiled it for me."
3,Can less be more....You bet!,"Amadeus has been one of my favorite movies since first I saw it,so I was very excited to hear of the added 20 minutes of footage in the ""Directors cut"" Blu-ray edition. More Amadeus...What could be better? The original, that's what.For the first time I realized how much good editing can contribute to a film. I found that the added scenes did nothing to improve the movie and in some instances even diminished it in some way. Although I generally approve of the addition of breasts to any film (not because they make a better film, I just like em') even this scene I feel was best left out.All in all, ""Amadeus"" with or without the added scenes, is in my opinion, one of the great films of all time.Watch it and enjoy!"
3,"Movie great, DVD ok.","This is indeed such a literate and enjoyable movie that on re-watching it I kept thinking, why can't Hollywood do this sort of thing more often?Regarding the DVD, the sound is great (Dolby 5.1) but the picture quality is grainy and distractingly non-DVD-like."
5,I Love This Movie,"One of my favorite movies ever. Who cares how much of Mozart's life was embellished or just plain fictionalized in ""Amadeus""? It introduced Mozart to thousands of people (the two soundtrack albums sold as if they were #1 pop hits). Certainly, it helped fuel a Mozart revival and increase the number of his compositions in orchestra repertoires. Bravo!I will never forget how the entire audience, when I first saw ""Amadeus,"" sat quietly all the way through the final credits at the end of the movie. And this was an audience in Dallas, full of teen-agers on a Saturday night. No one moved until the last note sounded of the gorgeous ""Romanza"" movement from the D minor piano concerto. What a tribute to Mozart's music."
2,"Great movie, passable DVD...wait for the deluxe version","This is a beautifully photographed and recorded film, and the performances are top notch. However, I own the laser disc collectors edition of this disc and not only is the video transfer better but the laser disc also has a ton of supplemental material (director commentary and some excellent extra scenes that were edited from the film). For [the price] it's not a bad DVD, but I'd recommend waiting for a DVD version of the laser disc package."
3,"Great movie, annoying DVD","This is one of my favorite movies ever, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the DVD format. You have to flip the DVD over in the middle of the film, which is a huge nuisance. I think the studios should re-do their single layer DVDs to make them Dual-layer. I have DVDs much longer than ""Amadeus,"" and you can see those movies on one side of the disc! Word of warning: whenever you shop for DVDs, make sure it is ""Dual-layer,"" not single. Single means that you'll have to get up and flip the disc mid-movie. (To find out, click on the ""more technical info"" link of the DVD that you're looking at)."
5,"Great Film, Good Picture","The additional scenes added in this cut are interesting, and fill out some plot holes in the original film. Good pickup and good picture quality."
5,Excellent,The picture was very well cast. All parts were well acted. The DVD arrived in pristine condition and played without flaw.
2,great movie - horrible mastering of dvd,"the movie is stellar, the people who mastered this dvd should be ashamed. This is for the 1997 & Jan 08 re-release of this movie. I owned the 1997 release and they split the movie half on side 1, the other on side 2. I thought the re-release, which I repurchased, would have the movie on 1 side, as technology has improved immensely, it was just the same horrible sub VHS copy as my original dvd. Having the movie as a ""flipper"" is impractical. I hope the blue-ray release will be remastered and for those who purchase won't be subjected to a grainy pixelated version.Very sad to see this movie put out this way. Again brilliant movie! Horrible DVD."
3,leaves out the trials of mozart in his greatest works,"i have seen another amadeus(maybe out of stock) , not this one with abraham. this movie did little justice to the his great works , with little mention of his works and life. the movie was more on the life of Salieri then it was on mozart. i would not recommend this movie . as a mozart artist and player this is a shame of a great composer. there is (an) i will find a movie of better quality of his great life and works.one that portrays his greatest conquest his requim that was left undone as he was still writing it as he laid dying in bed. should someone have a movie of a better quality please email me. the qreatest composer of the time must have a movie of his equal out there."
3,Digital copy work only on non Mac computer!,"Just be aware that the digital copy does not work on Mac computer (it should be illegal to advertise the product as having digital copy but not let the consumer know that it does not work on Mac, without opening the product packaging). Another similar product is DIe Hard 4 which also advertise as having digital copy but until you open the product you would not know that it does not work on Mac computers."
1,Two sides?!?! What a rip!,"Dual layer DVDs can hold 7GB. Braveheart, for example, is 3.5 hours long on a single side. For this 2.5 hour movie, I have to eject the DVD and turn it over! What's worse is that *NONE* of these two sided DVDs have any indication on the label of the box (or internet site) of this inconvenience...."
1,I would give this version a negative star vote if I could,"I always loved Amadeus and watched my VHS all the time. I accidentally ordered this director's cut, which I avoid religiously because I've never liked director's cut movies. This one is arguably the WORST I've seen. Even though Salieri is bad and is responsible for the death of Amadeus in the theatrical version, in this version he is made truly evil. That's only one thing I hated about it... I can't even list all the things I hated. There's even nudity, which just does not fit with the theme of this incredible movie. Buy the theatrical version- it's SO much better than this one, and if you have not seen the theatrical version and hate this movie, then buy or rent that one. You won't be disappointed!"
1,stupid dvd,the whole point in buying dvd's is to get a higher quality video experience than traditional vhs formats. so why does time warner continue to sell dvd's like this one where you have to flip the dvd in order to watch the entire movie. makes no sense why they can't fit the whole film on one side. i strongly recommend no one buy this and the many other dvd's this company offers until they come out with a version with the entire film on one side. the fact they they fail to note this massive flaw on the package continues to frustrate all customers. just plain stupid.
2,Wha???,"First let me tell you how excited I was to watch this movie again after so many years...I was very frustrated from the moment the disc went into the player! There was background music playing and I could see them speaking but couldn't hear them. Weird. Ok so i checked the player, it was fine. After fiddling with the menu for what seemed like 10 minutes, I got sound. Good. Let's watch the movie. Chapter 23 ends. Yep, just ends and I was like where is the rest of the movie??? There weren't two discs...where could the rest of the movie possibly be? So I thought for a moment and I took the disc out and flipped it over. There it was, 14 more chapters. I don't think I have ever flipped a disc in my life...seriously. OK, play... again background music and NO talking again. Had to fiddle with it and the menu many more minutes. It totally took away from the experience. Very disappointed with quality."
5,"""...The greatest composer known to me.""","""Amadeus"" is the most entertaining film I have ever seen! It has absolutely everything that a great movie should: fabulous acting (among other performances: F. Murray Abraham's incredible Academy Award winning portrayal of Antonio Salieri; Tom Hulce in an equally tremendous performance as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; and Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze Mozart); the best music ever composed (mostly Mozart - `nuff said), brilliantly played by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields; Peter Schaffer's Academy Award winning screenplay; spectacular, Academy Award winning sets and costumes; and a fascinating plot. ""Amadeus"" so completely fulfills my highest ideal of great cinematic entertainment that it reigns supreme at the top of my list of the greatest films ever produced!"
1,Embarrassing release,"This disc features a grain filtered transfer with no 1080p detail whatsoever, instead you get smeary textures everytime something moves. Completely unacceptable for a film of this stature. WB, show some respect and release a decent and film-like version of this film on Blu Ray, not this video travesty."
2,Different than what is advertised.,"I did not got what I ordered. The information on line said there were 2 discs and when opened it there was only one disc. Another thing, right after I paid for the blue ray I was offered the same blue ray at $5 less than what I paid for. This is unacceptable, so I returned the the product."
3,The theatrical version was better,"Plain and simple. When it came time to replace my VHS cassette tape version, I bought this one- the director's cut.....I was disappointed after watching it.I found it very distasteful when Solieri extended his contempt for Mozart to Mrs. Mozart. It ruined the film.In the theatrical version, Solieri simply misled Mrs. Mozart in order to spy Mozart's works. He became a liar. It revealed or highlighted Solieri's inner conflict, his lying to himself. To me that is what gave the characters believability and tension.In this director's cut Solieri made Mrs. Mozart strip to gain his influence and considerations, but then called in the guards after she stripped, to publicly make a whore of her.....To me it did ruin the film, and changed the character of the film. The characters went from tense and suspenseful to lewd and ignorant. It ruined the film!I am shocked that these other reviewers didn't feel the same thing. Look for the theatrical version."
4,Teachers Beware,"I have shown the original version of this movie many times over the years in my classroom as part of a unit on Mozart and was very familiar with the content of the movie. This newer version contains scenes that were not in the original and I was not aware that scene 16 contains nudity until I showed it to my seventh graders-so beware! By the way, this movie is unrated as there were no ratings for movies at that time-the original does contain some inappropriate language which I explain to my students that the use of this language helps to explain Mozart's behavior."
5,Fantastic Edition,"A beloved film in a wonderful DVD. I find myself quoting lines from this film in conversation as I get older. What a marvel the storytelling and camerawork are, this film holds up very well!"
4,"One giant ""Special Feature""","This is a wonderful piece of eye candy for anyone who enjoyed Amadeus. My only complaint, is that one brief but classic bit of footage was removed from the director's cut: It was when Salieri was talking to God of ""ruin(ing) your incarnation..."" and his face twisted into pure bitterness as he looked upward, then he glanced at the priest, and broke into an inexplicably sweet face. It was such a charater-enriching moment, that made me decide to keep my original, and treat this new set as a giant ""Extra""."
5,"A taerg eivom (say it backwards, silly!)","Striking story chock-full of wonderful music, great costumes, highbrow and lowbrow settings. One of the top 10 musicals in my collection."
4,"Mozart, a man before his time.","I'm not good at writing, but...The comic nature that Tom brings to the character of Mozart is superb. From what I have read on Mozart, the movie plays well, touching lightly on different parts of Mozart's life. While not going into great depth on anything, the movie is one not to be missed. The best thing about the movie is the approach from another composer who has admired Mozart's work anonymously, and feels his actions may have lead to Mozart's demise. The musical scores are awesome... listen in Surround!"
1,I prefer the theatrical version,"Since the middle 90s I have a beautiful laserdisc of the theatrical version of this movie and I'll keep it as long as the theatrical version won't be available again. I bought once the director's cut and I hate it and threw it away. Most of the time, the director's cuts are wonderful but this time, it's awfull."
2,"Sumptuous, but it's not Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart....","Despite the beautiful costumes, production values, and exquisite music, I have never been able to sit through this entire movie because of the DISTORTION of Mozart's personality--created to 'justify' the irritation that Salieri was supposed to have felt because of the superiority of Mozart's music. Mozart was NOT the 'goofball' depicted in this movie! He had a sense of naughty humor (read his letters exchanged with a cousin, gathered and published in a book that I'm sure you'll find in the library). But he knew how to behave himself and was not as irresponsible as the writers made him look (in order to 'prove' their point about jealousy)."
3,DIRECTOR'S CUT DOESNT DELIVER,"Like Wolfgan Amadeus sais in the movie, too many notes! How can can you re-write what's already perfect ???...the original movie is GREAT...Directors cut gives scenes that mislead the characters personalities already established....TOO MANY NOTES!!!Also I am maaad with Amazone because when I bought the blu ray never says it's the directors cut which I already have and hate!GET THE THEATRICAL VERSION IN BLU RAY!!!"
5,My favourite movie!,This is one of the best movies i have seen for a long time. In fact it is the movie that got me into classical music. The scene with Saglieri explaining one of Amadeus piece is one of the best ever. You should get this one even if you are not interested in Mozart. Maybe in the end you will be.
5,Excellent Best Picture Winner of 1984.,"""Amadeus"" is easily one of the best movies ever made that won Best Picture for 1984. It's a story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played wonderfully by Tom Hulce (Oscar-nominated), who was a composer all his life until he died mysteriously at the age of 35 in 1791. F. Murray Abraham won the Oscar for playing Antonio Salieri, a competent composer, and Milos Forman won the Oscar for Best Director. I have this movie on DVD and I am glad to have it for my collection. An excellent film."
4,Amadeaus DVD,"My favorite movie, had it, this was a replacement because the ""borrowers"" must have taken the original. If you like Mozart, you'll love this film. It really showcases his many opera's and other musical pieces. F. Murray Abraham is FANTASTIC as Salieri, Mozarts rival in the music world. Tom Hulce as Mozart is outrageous. A music lovers movie"
2,"A Great Film, Made a Little Less Great","Debates about the original theatrical release vs. the Director's Cut can be found in other reviews. I enjoy both versions of the film.My major complaint with this release is the quality of the video. Warner has used DNR (digital noise reduction) to ""clean up"" the film. The film grain is no longer visible - even when the video is projected onto a large screen - and fine detail has been lost or smeared.This really breaks my heart, as this is one of my favorite films. I can only hope there is eventually a better video mastering committed to disc."
2,Why do they do this?,"You can omit the trailers, the commentary and all the extras. Just don't make me flip the DVD to watch the whole movie."
5,Great Movie,"I really have loved this movie for years. Now i had the chance to get it in HD.It just looks great on full HD. a bit grainy on some dark scenes but not to cry over it. love the colors, the music etc.. sadly enough my receiver is broken so i had to content myself with the osund coming out of the tv.But this is a must if you love classical music. This version comes with a cd containg music from the movie, a booklet with pics and actors biografy and a disc that will halp you get your digital copy for mobile stuff.Go buy it. you wont regret"
4,Mozart Lover,Always a lover of created stories of real people. The Characters were over the top. Mozart's fear of his father was carried off so well and the snobbery of the court musicians was fabulous. The characters are a true study in acting so the movie is worth watching for the tremendous variety of character studies by their actor/ess.
3,Too Bad Original Release Isn't Blu-Ray!,"The original theater version of Amadeus was very entertaining, as was its release on DVD. Many times so-called ""director's cuts"" do add something worthwhile (Blade Runner comes to mind). However, in my opinion, this Amadeus director's cut is simply an exercise in bloat and gratuitous, boring excess; to use an apropos phrase, ""too many notes"". The original released on Blu-Ray would have been much more enjoyable."
2,Rubbish,"I think we live in an age where truth doesn't matter. The film 'Amadeaus' is a prime example of how a completely fabricated story can pass off as something genuine. The film has created a bogus story for the sake of drama and sensationalism. It makes Mozart look like some God who had everything easy and then goes on to say his father's death had something to do with his death. Hollywood will anyting to create mystery out of nothing. Most embarassing of all, Mozart's wife calls him ""Wolfy"". Boy, I'm sure people in the 1700's talked like that!!"
2,A Mediocre Mozart,"As a work of fiction, this movie was acceptable. Yet, it is the reason that many people think Mozart was a childish pervert. He wasn't. He actually was very intellegent and capable of upholding the strict standards of decorum of 18th century Vienna. Shaffer has created a fictional Mozart, and that has greatly influenced the way society pictures the true Mozart. If one wishes to see a mediocre example of film-making, watch this movie. If one wishes to see how Mozart really was. . . just listen to his music."
1,Incomplete Movie!!!,The disc only contained half the movie and kicked back to the menu after scene 23 (Where Mozart conducts the opera he wrote for his deceased father). I tried to select the scene where it cut out and that's all that's on the disc. What a jip!!!! I want my money back.
3,only if you buy the three DVDs deal,"When searching for DVDs in which the actor, Gary Oldman appears, Amadeus [Blue Ray Book] appears in the search on Amazon.com site of his name. But you only get a movie in which Gary Oldman appears, if you buy the three DVD deal for Immortal Beloved [Blu-ray], Amadeus, and Inception. Gary Oldman only appears in Immortal Beloved."
3,Funny movie.,It's a good movie to watch with a guy because it's sports related. Plus there's enough in it to make women happy too.
1,MESSED UP DISC,"WHEN I PLAYED THIS DVD FROM AMAZON THERE WERE AT LEAST THIRTY BREAKS IN IT MAKING ME THINK, AT FIRST, THAT OVERNIGHT, THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY PLAYER. NOT SO! ITS THE DVD!!!! IT RUINED THE FILM."
3,"""Way too predictable""","Major League was way too predictable from beginning to end. Though it had a great cast, I would really call it ""funny funny"" because I didn't laugh much. However, it was in no part boring and I watched it without stopping once. The point is...baseball players who are horrible is not my idea of really really funny, like everyone else said. It's also not my kind of Weslet Snipes's movie, comparing it to Blade and the other movies he has starred in. I suggest you rent it first. If you love it, buy it. If you don't, then plainly return it the first day you got it and don't see the sequel. By the way...Major League 3: Back to the Minors has the complete same story and jokes so if you see any of the sequels first don't expect anything new in the original. I give it three stars.Time: 105 minutes.Rated R for strong language, brief rear nudity, and crude humor."
3,Worth the money for under $10.00,"This Blu-Ray disk is well worth the money for being under $10.00. Decent enough extras; however, the ""Wild Thing"" edition means nothing. The film is very good quality visually and it has great audio. As long as it stays inexpensive, I would recommend."
1,Major League DVD (Wild Thing Edition),"The DVD I ordered has the artificial turf on the cover. The DVD I received did not. I already had the DVD, but I wanted the one with the grass on the cover."
1,2 hours you'll never get back,"How can any self-respecting baseball fan say they actually LIKE this movie? It doesn't respect the game. It's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who watches it, and downright scandalous in light of 2 terrifically realistic movies (""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"") from about the same time. If you want slapstick pratfalls and sophomoric humor, there are lots of better places to go. If you want baseball, stay away from this one."
4,"A suprisingly funy film, very enjoyable","I felt this was a beautiful film. Just the right amount of romance combined with side splitting comedy. This is one of the few times some of these actors (Wesley Snipes) have appeared in comedies and I laughed out loud. Humor, Romance and a stand up and cheer ending, who could want more?"
1,You sent me a DVD for a region that does not work in Australia,Why do you ship a DVD to a country (Australia) that has a different region code to the USA and obviously cannot work?
3,I don't get the appeal,"I love baseball. I love baseball movies. I didn't see this until just recently, and it didn't live up to the hype. There were some very funny moments, but they were often far too predictable."
4,Classic Fun,"Who doesn't like watching Charlie Sheen as ""Wild Thing""...must have been an easy character for him to play. And who could have imagined years later you would be seeing Pedro ""Jobu"" Cerrano doing car insurance commercials? Good times."
4,great classic movie,Been waiting to watch this movie for a long while.. It's a classic to me and shows great actors @ their best...
5,"Love at first ""view""",No matter how many times we watch this movie - and we caught it when it first came to the theaters - it never ceases to make us laugh. Loved Willie May Hayes!!!!
5,"Funny, funny movie",This was a gift for my son who is 19. He loves this movie and thinks it's hilarious. He would watch it anytime it was on TV. Now he can watch it anytime he wants. He quotes from this movie all the time. He is a big baseball fan.
5,"""Major Leagur""","Although this is an older sports film, it still holds plenty of anecdotes for the viewer. Charlie Sheen's character, the ""Wild Thing"", is a rebel with a cause. He plays a pitcher on a Major League team chock full of misfits. They are able to pull it together and make a highly unexpected run for a championship."
4,This Film Never Gets Old,"I watch this film at least once during each baseball season. I'm not an Indians fan. I simply love baseball, and as a fan, I appreciate many of the jokes. Also, as a sports writer for over a decade, there are some ""inside baseball"" jokes that have an amazing shelf life."
3,Ball Four Meets Bull Durham Meets Naked Gun meets Rocky,"A captivating, often hilarious, sometimes lewd, rude and profane baseball underdog story that remains the only time the Indians have finished the season with a postseason victory since 1948. Like ""Naked Gun"" the jokes sometimes come so fast and furiously that only some of them hit the mark, but there are many laugh-till-you-cry moments and quotable lines. As someone who lived in Cleveland from 1977-2000, the movie has special poignancy for me, especially the brilliant opening. The movie is ""just a bit outside"". It is a little too sentimental, silly and unfocused to match the best satires and a little too wacky, lewd and profane to equal the best romcoms or underdog dramas. Still, it is crowd-pleasing entertainment, helped a lot by good-looking action scenes. (Although Tom Berenger does need to work on his bunting) It earns its R rating for its lewdness and rudeness, including partial and cardboard nudity."
4,"Original and funny,,especially for Baseball fans",The best in the series of the Major League series. A little corny and predictable but entertaining. Berenger plays the role of a veteran catcher and Snipes and Sheen play characterful rookies.But I am a baseball fan and could be considered biased.
3,Movie was for my husband,The movie wasn't for me to view so I can't give you much of an answer. My husband loves this movie
3,"Not bad, but not the best either","This book is not what you'd expect. It still stresses memorization and is filled with good recipes. The practice tests are pretty much a joke. I can't see how you can expect to land a job by using this book only. Becoming an accomplished bartender after using this book is at best, a pipe dream. I am not at all satisfied with it's promises. Most of the one day period stated in the title is supposed to be spent practicing the recipes. Remove the recipes from the book, and there are very few pages of usefull information here."
3,A Little Childish,"I found there to be more pictures than necessary. Though many of them were ""cute,"" but they did not add to the informative base of the book. The book is more for a child than an adult, but entertaining enough."
3,It's OK,"The book is what I needed and the price was fairly reasonable. The book looks very used,the pages looks like it can fall out at any time,but it's clean with no markings."
2,better for teens,"Though it doesn't say so, this book seems designed more for young adults than for grown-up readers. Pre-teens & teens may find it interesting."
5,A valueable reference,"I really enjoy owning this book. A couple times a week I go to this book to look up something that I've always wondered about New York City.Recent questions this book has answered for me:Why do some buildings have old water towers on top and not others? What is that clanging noise in my radiator? Does somebody personally read the name and address every time I send a first class letter or is there a machine that does it? Where does my market buy their food from? Does anybody manage harbor traffic to make sure all those tankers don't crash, or do they just obey the rules of the road and hope for the best? How do they clean the ceiling of tunnels from all the car exhaust and how often do they have to do it? How many ""no parking"" signs are there in NYC? Does the Stove or the microwave use more electricity? How many trees in central park?If you are the kind of person who wonders about the mechanics of life this is a good book to have around."
1,This book is an antique.,"I'm glad I didn't open the enclosed CD. I'd then be selling this book. I understand the basics of HTML coding haven't changed, but when I read the forward of this book, I knew it was out of date. 2nd edition, first published in 2000 this book is behind the times in computer time. Netscape the wave of the Future? All code checked with windows 98? What good could the enclosed CD be with a 2000 version of Explorer and Coffee Cup. This book would be of no help to a Myspace user and was no help to me. Still looking for an up to date guide.hurricanejerry"
3,Recommended for a class I'm taking ...,"This book was (1) of (3) books recommended by the teacher of my online CSS & XHTML class.It's more like a workbook than a manual, so it helps to work chapter by chapter.It's easier to use than a manual and much less cumbersome.However, I feel ""Headfirst HTML with CSS & XHTML"" by O'Reilly is more comprehensive while still holding onto the ""workbook"" style.Make this book your SECOND choice to the O'Reilly book."
3,"Beginner, but not ""cool""...","I got this to be an aid in teaching HTML and CSS to a 13-yr-old.There is a lot of your standard HTML stuff in here and even some decent CSS basics, but as for being a good start towards creative or ""cool"" sites utilizing the contents; it's not. Just some run of the mill examples. It even has whole sections dedicated to frames. Yech. The CSS examples are pretty limited too. One small chapter on CSS inline text formatting (no stylesheet use) followed by a large chapter on table based layouts. What a shame.Decent for a beginner, but I'd gravitate towards ""CSS Web Design for Dummies"" instead."
3,Good but perhaps too extensive,The didactic work is perfect the author is really expert in the subject and the expression is very didactic the examples are very well selected.The Web that accompanies the book he is excellent.Although you dominate to the Web the book can teach of rigorous way many aspecteos to you that we do not know demasido.It is an excellent tool to consult and to clarify ideas.Jordi Guim Jordi Guim
3,where is the cool web sites,"the book is ok for beginner level,it looks same like any other dhtml book with java script and css,but i don't see any cool web site examples ."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"Jonathans' all so positively inspiring lyrics, outstanding vocal range and capabilites, his brilliant acoustic fluidity and musical arrangement, on Brand New Day, are truely to be admired. Jonathan and all involved take it nice and easy on 'You Are My Everything', 'He Said He Would', 'I Love to Worship', 'Tell Me (Do You Still Love Jesus), I Believe, and the beautiful duet with one of his sweet sounding songbird daughters Jodie, titled 'Mercy'. Jonathan continues his infectious devotion to God with the upbeat memoriable 'O, Magnify The Lord', 'Brand New Day', 'Gonna Lift You Up', 'Let The Redeemed Say So' and 'We Love To Praise Your Name'. This is a wonderful CD, to listen to in your car, or just listen to with your loved ones(children included), in good times or bad. Judiciously absorb each positive word, and note, of Jonathans' 'Brand New Day' and I'm sure you'll agree, it is absolutely brilliant. Thank you God, for Jonathan Butler."
5,Great New Album,Great new album but not like the first one . I would have loved to see more african traditionally scored music
4,A Great Little Coffeemaker!,"I ordered this coffeemaker for one reason--its color (empire green) matched my kitchen and the rest of my KitchenAid appliances. But it does a lot more than look great on my kitchen counter. It quickly brews the best tasting coffee I have ever had; the carafe is truly no-drip while pouring; the swing-out basket makes it easy to insert and remove the filter and coffee grounds. My only complaints--the pause-and-pour feature sometimes works and sometimes keeps dripping(but as fast as this machine brews a pot of coffee, this is not really a problem)and I cannot figure out where the cord storage is supposed to be. Overall, this coffeemaker is a great value. And did I mention how great it looks on my counter?"
5,Just right,We do not drink very much coffee but this one is just perfect! It works great and looks great. Awesome for company that comes over and they want coffee after a meal or with dessert. Love it!!
4,More from the Ultimate Alternate Historian,"I found ""Ruled Britannia"" to be a very fascinating read, with well-detailed characters, a plausible setting, and certainly enough tension and drama to keep me turning pages when my body was crying out for sleep. This is a good read for anyone interested in Shakespeare, Elizabethan England, or alternate history; even more so for those of us fascinated by all three!"
4,Turtledove rewrites history again,"""Ruled Brittania"" is typical of Harry Turtledove's work. He has obvious love of history and takes care to place the reader in the time he's describing - albeit a slighlty skewed view.In an Elizabethan London, conquered by the Spanish armada, William Shakespeare is asked to write a play to incite the English to overthrow their occupiers. He must do this while under the vigilant eyes of the Spanish. A most usual story of spies and resistance.I have often been frustrated that the author leaves the reader hanging with a sequel coming in a few months. Alternate history readers will be pleased to know that ""Ruled Brittannia"" is a complete book and wraps up all loose ends before Turtledove's handy historical notes at the end.It's a long, fairly pendantic, book but it offers a tantalizing glimpse at an Elizabethan England that never was. If you like your history paired with a clever tale, this one's for you."
1,Too many words,Too many words .............................................. and then after about 475 pages the 'action' starts .................. To read or not to read is not the question !
1,Ruled Britannia,"I was once a Turtledove fan, but not after starting this revolting anti-Catholic screed. Turtledove has lost the mark."
4,Decent Read,"Well, this book isn't exactly for those who do not understand or care for anything Shakespeare, as the author writes in similar ways and words throughout most of the book. And since the book deals with history, then those not acquainted with the general information of that time may be lost. Not a whole lot of action, but some suspense. I feel it was a good read, but I am glad I've finished it. I read this book because of the author recognition and feel that the books about the ramifications of the North losing the Civil War are much better. But anyway, read this if there is nothing else to read or are interested in either Shakespeare, history, or both."
5,Again Mr. Norton pulls together a great collection,I just can't get enough of cat antics! There is something for everyone in this charming set. And I usually don't even like short stories!
3,Nice case but...,"Nice case, a 4"" barrel pistol with a few mags, maybe a speed-loader and a brush will fit but if you want to lock it the mechanism is only cosmetic. Nice plush red velour interior."
4,Almost the perfect size,"In response to the review below mine, the lock is fully functional. all you have to do is push the clips down and make sure you hear the little snap sound that tells you they are in place. then put in the key and turn it a full 360 degrees and you will be able to see the little metal bar slide into place.I just recieved my gun case in the mail and the first thing i notcied was how great my gun looked in it with the red(almost velvet) interior. I have a Beretta 92 and it fits with plenty of room to spare for longer barrel guns. the case has plenty of extra room for cleaning supplies and a little slot where i keep a rag. the only thing that i found that looked nice but was impractical was the wooden block inside to store something like 13 bullets. i wish that the case had just a little bit more room to store an extra clip or two. but other than that it is a great case and i would recomend it to anyone with a pistol."
3,"Nice blade, wrong part","I purchased this for my 12-cup food processor and it was not the correct fit. This was not KitchenAid's or Amazon's fault. Be sure when buying this that you have the star connector, not the D-shaped one that the new models use. If you have the D-shaped connector look for part KFP7SL6 instead. (At the time of writing this Amazon did not have the item listed and I had to purchase it directly from KitchenAid.)"
3,Stanley Goes Pop!,"Hmmm... Stanley Clarke has always been an innovator of not just bass, but music.. This album, well, is lacking that conviction.. Stanley seemd to have gotten lost in the early to mid eighties.. He decided to follow the growing trend of producing simple, beat driven dance music. Although it is important for a musician to grow and develop, Find Out! falls short of that objective... when listening to this disc, you get the feeling that Stanley had some contractual agreement to live up to, and he just banged out a quick dance record to satisfy some corporate head..Problem is, it doesn't satisy the ones who really matter in the end.. Us."
3,A Little Better than Average,"I Respect Stanley Clarke alot.He is One of The Greatest Bass Players Ever.as a Musician in General He is a Genius.But Material Like this Doesn't Do Him Full Justice.He is So Talented that He Can Do Most of the Material Here in His Sleep&that's Cool For Outtakes but not as Product.I Love His Old Stuff&Of COurse The RTF Years Plus His Movie Scores, but Like Herbie Hancock Another Great Musical Genius Sometimes Trying Too Sound Contempary Backfires.but I Give The Brothers Props For trying Something Different Mixed Results."
5,Fit's great!,"We bought our son a 92 Chevy pickup and the dash was quite old and cracked from the sun. I ordered this dash mat and it not only fits like a glove, it makes the dash look brand new again. The very first purchase we make after every car we buy is a custom made dash mat. The dash on our 2000 Taurus looks like brand new--too bad the rest of the car doesn't look as good!"
1,A disappointment,"I ordered this toaster because of the slim size and low profile. It worked well for a week, but then shortly thereafter it began to brown only on one side. This toaster did not work well for long at all, and was a real disappointment."
2,Back to the drawing board Kitchen-Aid,"I have the yellow version which goes perfectly in my new beach house kitchen. However, I will have to return the toaster again--this will be my second time for the same reason. The reset button gets stuck and flashes like a VCR. Once the reset gets stuck (which is every other time), the only way I can get the toast to come up is to unplug the toaster. When it does work, it toasts perfectly, but I don't think I can accept such defects in such an expensive two-slice toaster."
3,I feel so sorry for Papa Bear,"Poor, poor Papa Bear... In THE BEARS' VACATION, by Stan and Jan Berenstain, Small Bear gets taught a few simple rules for when you're at the beach. And although this seems harmless, for every rule Papa Bear recites, something happens to him. For instance,Rule number six is to keep a sharp lookout whil you are out on a boat. Easy enough, right? Well, as Papa Bear 'keeps a look out' for Small Bear, a huge ocean liner comes up from the opposite direction than the way Papa Bear looks. All in all, I found this a fairly humoring story. I gave it a 3 out of 5."
1,No life jackets,"How can any book about water safety not include life jackets? Not only are they not mentioned, the Bears are never shown wearing them. We spend lots of time around water, and I don't appreciate having to explain to my kids why they have to wear life preservers when the Berenstain Bears don't."
3,Just okay...,"Love Berenstain Bears, love the beginner books, but this one really isn't very exciting. There's not much variety in it...it's all about ""water safety"" Papa Bear style (think The Bike Lesson) but with no real variety. There's no ""vacation"" story in it. If you want a good Berenstain Bear book for young children, I recommend The Spooky Old Tree or The Bears' Picnic over this by a mile."
4,One of the older Bears books :),"Waaaaaay back before they started their moralizing series of paperbacks, the Berenstain Bears starred in a series of early readers. These are MUCH funnier than the paperbacks, let me tell you!In this one, Papa Bear resolves to teach Small Bear how to be Safe at the Beach, and loads him up with tip after tip... each one illustrated in graphic detail when Papa Bear forgets to follow his own advice and ends up needing to be saved by his son. LOL!This sort of humor is a big hit with my nieces, and funny books, of course, encourage children to read. I'd definitely check it out."
5,Vince Seneri's CD is all that and more!,"Keep Vince Seneri on your radar, because he's going to be around for a long time! He worked his magic with the B3 on Street Talk! Also, let's not forget the top-rate musicians he's got with him on this project: David ""Fathead"" Newman, Dave Valentin, and Houston Person. It had to be great! This one you definitely want to have.Submitted by Patricia in NY, NY, USA"
5,Not a review but a comment,"This was a great episode, and like other classic Doctor who episodes that were classified as comedy, ""Forgive me for not being British, for I don't always understand British humour"""
5,Vengenance,"This Who story is a must see before the trial of a time lord, it will help with the stury line."
4,Terror on Tape,"The 22nd season of ""Doctor Who"" wasn't well liked by the public. Probably because it was so violent. And that is what ""Vengeance on Varos"" is, a take off on TV violence, to the grimmest extent. Philip Martin's gruesome plot is surely funny in a repulsive way. Cannibals, acid baths, etc. all broadcasted on an alien world, and in turn broadcasted into your home! Watch out for that economic slug Sil (Nabil Shaban) in one of Colin Baker's most determined performances.It's a pity there's only two episodes..."
5,Jim Croce- Life and Times,There was only one Jim Croce. This CD is number 2 of 3 he put out during his too short career. These songs reflect the inner Croce. This is a fabulous CD!
5,A great find,I was very happy and surprised to find this recording available on CD. The sound quality has different characteristics than what comes across on the record but still excellent.
5,Gile,"Great book, very useful for the translator and for the translator's teacher. Makes you think about the translating process like you wouldn't have."
2,Good for an advanced course,"I had this book as required material for an introductory course in interpretation and translation, and found that I really struggled with it as did most of the class. It is very dry reading for the most part and it seems that they use a lot of technical language that someone in an introductory class wouldn't be familiar with. Even the language around the jargon is pretty complex and hard to understand with a college sophomore reading level. The students in the class who were ESL students were even more confused with it. I really feel this book would be much better suited to someone who was already in the field for a while and has a very high reading comprehension and an interest in the topic and simply wanted a refresher of the different models and theories."
2,Really bulky and not much vibration,"I bought this as a spare for travel. It is huge, bulky, and barely vibrates. I won't replace it when the batteries run out."
1,LOUD,"This is the worst toothbrush ever. It is very, very, very loud and the brushing is hard, course and irritating. I used it for a week and then gave up."
2,Condescending and disappointing,"The previous reviewer who said this book is condescending hits it right on the head. Century thinks that by hanging around these guys, and having a black girlfriend, he is now one of them. He even comments on how when he is out with the crew, people would get out of his way, like he was now suddenly a tough guy. His girlfriend said it best (I don't have the exact quote but can remember it pretty good) ""You can go to all the reggae parties and hip-hop clubs you want, you'll still be a white Jewish guy from Canada!"""
1,Truly Disappointing,"With all these ""glowing"" reviews, I thought this book might be a good read. Instead, I came away with a sneaky feeling that the author's friends wrote the reviews. The writing is sorely lacking, and his ""sensitivity"" is more of a poor stab at sensationalism. Simply not believable. There is a more recent book, MUCH BETTER written (by a white guy who spent a long time living among Bloods and Crips out in the L.A. ghettos)--an amazing, well-written story that leaves you simply stunned at that writer's insight, and his ability to make pathetic characters into sympathetic ones who jump off the page and grab you by the throat!"
3,"Entertaining, but probably not worth getting the Finger.","This is a nifty little Republic noir which benefits from good performances by a lot of familiar character actors. But unfortunately they are not the only thing familiar about this film. The basic plot is a fairly hoary one, the likes of which you've seen dozens if not hundreds of times on TV shows, without the zesty dialogue of Cry Danger or the kinetic energy of White Heat.It involves a three-time loser who is caught and realizes if he doesn't work with the cops he will go away for a long time, so he decides to try and be more than a mug by helping them break a crime ring. As said before, all this is well-acted, but the lead character just seems a little too scrawny to play the tough guy, especially versus somebody like Timothy Carey (from Kubrick's The Killing). And the story unfolds just the way you expect it to.Yet, if you like black-and-white 50's noir, rent it and see if you'd give it an extra star. Maybe I'm being overly harsh."
2,Not as good as others out there,"I had originally purchased a pair of EarHugger headphones, and I loved them. Unfortunatly I lost them when I missed placed my gym bag. I searched and found these which I thought would be a decent replacment, but I don't like them nearly as much as the other pair. These just don't feel as comfortable, don't have a built in volume control, don't have foam padding over the earpiece (and I think mine are defective since the left headphone continually gives me little shocks.) So if you are looking for ear bud style headphones, I would suggest passing on these and getting the EarHugger AV-2000 Earbud-Style Headphone."
3,Informative but not descriptive.,I have to say this book is good. It is also tiny and discreet about the size of a silver dollar and a little thicker than a small stack of napkins. The book gives some common sense knowledge on how to improve your love life. Most of it is straightforward and is covered in almost every other sex education book. If you are disturbed or disheartened by large books or sex education this book is a good starter and can be read in less than an hour. If you are looking for something new and new posistions etc. This is not a how to guide. Great for beginers.
2,"Has Its Pluses, Your Needs May Vary","There is no doubt that the design of this Pedrini kitchen timer is eye-catching. But when it gets right down to it, this snazzy-looking little number may or may not suit your personal needs.Pluses: Easy to set, whether you have arthritis or are wearing enormous oven mits. When set 15+ minutes, the ring is very loud and clear, with an appealling old-fashioned bell sound. Numbers are easy to read.Minuses: The picture is misleading and the construction questionable: the handle is metal, but both the black and silver sections of the base are plastic. When set to shorter intervals, the ""no ring"" problem described by the previous reviewer becomes an (annoying) issue.All in all I would say I am disappointed with this item, but since I use it primarily to time family activities, it's not what I would call a soufflé-in-the-rain type catastrophe.If you are looking for an all-purpose kitchen timer, however, this is definitely not your best bet."
2,"Attractive and ergonomic, but ultimately impractical","Great sleek design; chrome and black are classics. The very ergonomic twistable handle makes picking up and setting this timer a pleasure. However, the fatal drawback to this timer is that the dial face rests flat on your kitchen counter and even curves downward. Once you start using it, you quickly realize that probably every other timer you've owned had a flat, vertical face which was viewable from distance. With this timer, when you've set it on the counter so that '0' is viewable, you can't see the pointer to the number of minutes remaining because it may be on the other side. Or if you set the timer down with the pointer on the number of minutes you've just set viewable, then as the pointer rotates around out of sight down toward zero, you can't tell how much time is left. So while this timer is beautiful and ergonomic, it's not practical. Don't buy it unless you really love the design and can think of a way to mount it on a wall."
2,Dissapointed,"I had the pleasure of attending a performance of the touring company and loved every minute of it. Unfortunately the ""original cast"" recording does'nt (Live performance low audio quality) match the current casts performance level. A lot of the music is missing."
3,"Cute, but quality issues","This rocking horse is very attractive, and is solid, sturdy wood. However, the construction, while *simple*, isn't *easy*. The instructions are not entirely correct (for instance, it says to use 4 bolts, where there are 8 holes, and if you only used 4, you'd end up with 4 extra), and not all of the pre-drilled holes are in exactly the right spot, nor at the proper angle to allow the pieces to fit together flush, without serious strain to your fingers turning the little hex wrenches provided. Further, on my horse, the threads to attach the handles to the head are stripped on one side, with no way to replace or correct it short of returning the product or using some kind of glue to secure it in place. If I didn't have a drill and other tools, I would have had an extremely difficult time assembling this toy."
2,Overpriced,"Don't have it, was shopping online for rocking horses and found it somewhere else for 30 dollars less!!! DO YOUR COMPARING before buying."
2,Beware your application...,"I ordered this kit, 99-8205, for the Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe. Apparently there is a difference in the dash trim between 2003/2004 models and the 2005-2008. The dash kit was upgraded to cover all models from 2003 to 2008. However, they did not change the part number. So, I ordered a 99-8205 kit for my 2008 Matrix and received the older kit for the '03/'04 models. They have the same part number. I asked Metra customer service to send me the correct pieces and they said NO. The better option would be to order the Scosche TA2044B which is available here at Amazon for a better price and no hassle."
4,Nice kit!,"I bought this kit for a double din Pioneer P4200DVD system. It would work with a normal double din head unit perfectly, however, with the P4200DVD, the faceplate is motorized and the trim ring in this kit would not allow the faceplate to move. I remedied this by removing the bottom portion of the trim ring. Now it works fine.This is a good kit for my 04 Matrix--it fits perfectly. Expect to do some modifications to the kit to get everything to work correctly. Dremel is your friend."
3,It's ok. A little too plastic though.,"You know, this is just OK.Now that it's installed, it looks good enough (and it's great that they shipped all the parts for the 03-05 matrix, and 05-08, and support for both single and double-DIN)...But the whole thing is plastic, and it's just a little chintzy. Pressing on the buttons of the new stereo, it has a lot more ""give"" then I would like... but myabe I'm just fussy. Still, I can't help but wish some of the pieces that attached the unit to the dash internally were metal.I will say that the instructions are great. Putting it all together was super easy, and everything was well written, with clear pictures."
1,Does not fit 2007 Vibe!!!!!!!!!!,"We bought this and it DOES NOT fit our 2007 pontiac vibe. It doesn't line up and sticks way out and too low so we can't put the dash on. Also, the screws provided were far too short to actually connect the radio to the dash kit.DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A 2007 Pontiac Vibe!!!"
5,Affordable and looks great,"This product is affordable and fit great in my 2003 Vibe with a standard aftermarket radio. Putting the Kit together takes a little patience because you don't won't to strip any screw slots or break any plastic, but take your time & the final result is very pleasing."
3,Does the job,"The instructions were good enough for me to figure them out, although not as clear as they could be. The pieces fit together pretty well and I was able to install my new sound system. However, the shelf-like insert actually has holes in the bottom, so small items like change can fall down into the inside of your car's dashboard. Go figure."
2,'04 Matrix double din fit kit marginal,"This kit can be made to work, but the process is not intuitive nor is it robust without fully gluing the kit together as a double din. In my case I was installing a head unit with a 7"" LCD, and the kit had to be trimmed accurately as not to hit the factory fascia. Only 1/8"" made the difference of fitting and showing a gap. I could be wrong, but this seems to be the only kit available for double din on a '04 Matrix other than complete scratch fabrication."
3,"Good, but not great","I own a Matrix 2003, didn't met my expectation, once i had the stereo in place i had to re do the whole process 'cause didn't fit"
3,Works as intended,"Works as intended and allowed me to mount my wife's new stereo in her vibe, however, there are small holes at the back of the pocket that mounts under the radio which I was concerned about having small items and liquids fall through."
1,Does not fit 2005 Pontiac Vibe - buy the Scosche Pt2049B,"Tried to install this Metra kit on my 2005 Pontiac Vibe. I've installed a few decks, so this was not my first time. Took about 20-30 minutes to assemble the Metra pieces, of which the instructions were not easy to follow. The screws included hang on by a thread, so I ended up having to use super glue to hold the sides on. After getting it together I went to install it in the car. The problem was the mounting kit is too wide to fit into the trim piece. I tried both face plates, all the different options, and nothing worked. It is roughly 1/8 inch too wide - which is just enough to make it NOT WORK.Out of my frustration I overnighted the Scosche Pt2049B, and it is perfect. Came already assembled - and it feels literally 10x stronger. Installed in 5 minutes.No questions here- buy the Scosche.I don't work for either company - however I attempted both and one worked, and the other didn't. Don't waist your time and money like I did."
3,O6 Matrix - OK but ...,"Everything in this kit is a compromise so that it covers more applications.The screws to attach the pocket to the front face piece are too big. I went one size smaller and a little longer to solve things when the original screws wanted to cause the screw destination to split.The DIN sleeve has to come off of the radio and you use screws to hold the radio to the side brackets. Suitable screws were not provided and washers were necessary to fill the space between the radio and the bracket. Making up for the missing sleeve, I presume.With the DIN sleeve missing the trim ring is a loose fit. Used the best of the two provided in the kit.So it's OK but a little lacking in fit and finish."
1,An idiotic book,"Wanna be doesn't make it be. Next time show at least a microbe of proof. Badly written, poorly researched."
1,slavery was fun for the slaves,"In the very first couple of lines, i knew something was amiss.....""I knew my family,but they looked new to me,almost like cousins"".What the heck does that mean?Anyway ,slavery according to Miss McGhee apparently was a big bowl of cherries for the slaves!How could she actually believe that anyone with a lick of good sense would believe her story is beyond me.Only in chapter 19 does anything make any sense and it's obvious she had littlt to do with that.it rings true while everything reads like a storybook fantasy.If you're looking for real facts and baCKGROUND,IT'S IN SHORT SUPPLY HERE.WANT SOME OK SEXUAL READING.THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU,IT WASN'T FOR ME"
5,A New and INTERESTING Way To Learn History!,"This book was very interesting and allowed me to enjoy history... I did not think I would find a book about history that I could actually enjoy... Millie you have proved me wrong and I thank you for that... Got any more stories about your past??? If so e-mail me this young person is interested! You have led an interesting life and you are soo very loved by many... I'm probably one of your biggest fans and I know you will be getting that alot... But whether you believe me or not I know in my heart it is true... I too want to join in the line of erasing the colored line because it pains me to look around and see how many outcast people due to race... my dad is one of them and I totally hate it! I LOVE PEOPLE and I hope that people love me for my heart and soul not for what color I am because God made us all in his Image... We are all children of God... Love and Christ, Just another person in this world tryin to make a difference!"
1,not what I expected,"Somehow I couldn't buy that the author sat at a computer and had an outer body experience. Plus, this book was not well written. I thought if the author said SHE WAS REALLY PRETTY JUST LIKE ME about the slave one more time Id throw up. I wouldnt mind if she put more research into the book but most of it was just an imaginary story that the author made up. Couldnt get into it, sorry."
1,"Offensive, insulting and not factually based","As a Cuban American, I have become aware of my own racially mixed family history, so I know that people's heritage can be complex. I was really interested to find out about Hoover, because he caused some problems for my family. But this book really offended me. The author kept giving out so-called compliments that people looked white. She seems not to like her own race very much. The sexual episodes seemed out of place; I really couldn't see what they had to do with this book. So I turned to the chapter called ""Research"" hoping to find proof, but it was lacking there, too. There were several interesting things in that chapter, especially the idea of another underground railroad, but it never tied together the supposed genealogy that proves Hoover was African American. I really couldn't figure out what the author was trying to say with this book."
4,Informative,"Bravo Miss McGhee! Your book solidified what many of us had ""heard thru the grapevine"" for so long. I was especially impressed with your hometown research and photographs. It answered a lot of questions for me. I could have done without the graphic sexual portrayals, but if that was the way it was honestly revealed to you...well. But on the whole, I believe the book was well researched and hopefully gave others a hunger to further research the complicated man named Hoover."
1,a secret that should remain uncovered,"My brother in Seattle said that this book should be checked out! So, I ordered it,now I regret it!I thought this book would compare to:""The Six Black Presidents"",but it wasn't even close.Facts please to help us solve this J Edgar mystery is not evident in this book.I hope whomever did the 19th chapter will elaborate on what was actually discovered.Now that should make an interesting book.This one was merely about an obssesion by one woman for one man.............a married man at that and a slave owner.Sojourner Truth must be turning in her grave!"
1,Don't Buy This...,"Thought this would be great for night-time dog walking, but right out of the package, it did not work. (Yes, I did remove the battery terminal pull tab.) Seems pretty flimsy, would not buy this again. Still looking for something better..."
4,Animal Healing,"I enjoyed the book and used it a bit, I would need practice to become efficient. Very interesting."
1,DVD doesn't play!!!,"Unfortunately I didn't have the time to play this DVD until 6 days after the return policy ended. My DVD player says ""This type of disc can not be played"". I put in another DVD to make sure there was no problem with the DVD player and it played the disc. I was very disappointed because I would have loved the opportunity to do something really wonderful for my animals. Plus - in the present economy - who needs to just kiss off even $15!Added at a later date - I tried to play this in my computer but it didn't work there either. However, Amazon did give me a refund so I didn't waste any money on it."
2,Thompson,"Rhe product is NOT exactly what I ordered. There is a difference between Sheer Nutmeg and Nutmeg color. So, my deck is Two toned...and is NOT by choice"
3,Takes me back,I originally bought this album from a TV add when I was about 12. I listened to it until it was worn out! It's so fun to find it again.
4,Beautiful conflict,"On the cover they reccommend Jucifer to fans of the white stripes and sonic youth, among others. I disagree. The heaviness in the music would make jack and meg run and cry to their mommy, and the lyrics could not possibly be compared to anything the white stripes has written, as they are not pop fluff in the least. As enjoyable as this catchy album is, it is still very dark, yet not dark enough to take too seriously. The combination of the vocalist's soft voice, with the heavy riffs is something we rarely see in metal, but creates a great atmosphere. I think it's more appropriately compared to ... maybe Battle of Mice or Made out of Babies. Live they must be as hypnotic as Boris, but that is just a fantasy..."
2,Beware of Washing!!!,"I have owned my aarondale comforter for a little over a year. I have to say that it is so soft and a perfect weight, and obviously a beautiful pattern... HOWEVER, I do not recommend washing and drying the comforter. There is not enough quilting throughout the comforter to keep the batting in place. After 6-8 washings, the batting is ruined, bunched up in places and nonexistent in other places. Also, having a difficult time with Nautica trying to replace it. I would recommend having it cleaned!"
4,very good read,this is one of those books that you can really get into it. The characters and the story were so spell-blinding that I didn't want to put it down and found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning.
5,it only gets better,I have thoroughly enjoyed this series of book by the talented Thoenes. Look forward to readingall of their books. They have become my new favorite authors.
5,Love this book and the entire series!,"I absolutely love this book and the entire series! Brock and Bodie Thoene bring the perils of World War II to life. They have given us individual names and faces to the horror that thousands faced as they were persecuted by Hitler and his henchmen for a myriad of reasons. I started reading this series in junior high and even now (almost 20 years later) I'm still having trouble turning off my light at night because I'm so engrossed in the story!This book in particular radiates the message that the power of music can, indeed, carry us through the worst of times. It's tragic and heartbreaking yet makes us want to cheer all at the same time. I'm reading this one right now, and even though I already know what's going to happen I'm still waiting eagerly to go through it all again with the main characters."
3,Vertical Hanging Only,These frames sounded like exactly what I needed and they were pretty nice for the price until I realized that these frames can only be placed on a table or hung vertically. There is no hook for hanging the frames horizontally.This missing hook made them pretty much useless to me since my pictures that I purchased the frames for are horizontal pictures.I'm returning the frames now. I'm bummed because they are actually a good quality for the price.
5,Great product!,Nice product and will buy again. The frame was made well. It looked much nicer than I expected so that was a nice surprise.
1,MCS Fashion 8x10 black frames,Bought these frames for our house and was very disappointed. Items were well packaged but the first one I opened was chipped and scratched right out of the box. They are also very cheap quality. I can get much better quality for about the same price with coupons/sales at Michael's. Fortunately Amazon has a wonderful return policy so they are all going back!!
3,"Looks good, few problems","The frame it self is beautiful and well worth the price, however when it came it had a crack in the glass and the hanger is very flimsy making it hang a little awkwardly on the wall. The stand doesn't seem to be the most sturdy either."
3,Disappointed in the Quality,"I am disappointed in the quality of this frame for the price I paid. The ""bullnose"" is much thinner than I expected just from looking at the picture of the frame."
5,Nice frames,I just wanted a plain black frame and these fit the bill. I bought 2 and may be buying a few more. They seem durable. Let's hope so.
3,Nice but too expensive,This is a no frills picture frame. Bit of a pain to hang these on the wall as the stand sticks out bit too much at the back and you can not get it flush to the wall. I have found a better and cheaper alternative at IKEA.
4,good quality and worth penny,"Frame has a very good quality. The frame has a glass cover, so ship it carefully, Definitely worth the penny."
2,Main picture is not that of the product,"As of 1 NOV 2012, the primary picture of this product on Amazon is not the picture of this product. It has a frame border than looks to be at least an inch around the picture. The extra pictures below that appear to be the actual product which has only a 1/2 inch frame around it and thus has a much thinner look to it. It's only 7 bucks so it's not worth the hassle of returning it but buyer beware."
3,"A ""one picture only"" frame","This product was more cheeply made than I expected, but I paid a good price for them, therefore I am happy. They are definitely not the type of frames that I would want to change the pictures very often with. The back is held with several tabs that could easily snap off over time."
2,cheap and cheap-looking,"much thinner and more plastic looking than the photo. pay a little more to get a little more. i would not buy this again, i'm going to throw it away."
3,"Oh the ""Possibilities"".","Let me start by saying I like it. However this is an album that was unfinished at the time Michael died, and therefore was finished by others, based on hopefully what they thought he wanted in the final product. We'll never know if this disc would have been different had Michael not passed, but what can you do. It's still good like I said. Many songs are very well done, and it may peak at the end, when Bono sings with Michael on ""Slide Away"". Of course, it's nearly impossible not to compare this with the music of INXS. When I do that I feel this is as good as one of their lesser albums, which they had few of. I mean, this is not the caliber of ""Listen Like Thieves"" or ""Welcome To Wherever You Are"". In the end there's many ways to view this album, I guess the best way is to love the songs, most of which meet expectations, and be happy Michael had a great life, and made such wonderful music for years."
4,Like it!,"""Like the cd! You can listen he was going through something (with the words). I LOVE Michael voice. I purchased this cd because Biography channel did a special on Michael. That girl Paula was a trip! he had a awsome relationship before he met her! She just gave that poor man a lot of drama-- but what comes around goes around- she eventually died. I'm very glad his daughter is doing okay."""
2,Very average&please Let the Man Rest,Michael Hutchence should have gotten a final Better tribute than most of this Formula sounding Music.Only Slide Away with Bono is worthy of mentioning.Get on the inside is the closes you get to the Old Inxs's vibe.
5,mysterious and brilliant,"well I must say that I bought this album mostly becasue I'm a U2 fan and I just fell in love with ""Slide Away"" and when I listened to it all I just couldn't believe...I mean it's really great. All the songs are both lyrically and musically perfect. You may not find it as interesting at first listening but then you'll just love it, I guarantee."
1,"Ugh, no thank you!","Oh good- another girl-stuck-in-small-town dreams-big-escapes-with-dark-stranger book. Just what the world needs. This story has been done to pieces, by other, better writers. Blah blah diner robbery, money in a moosehead, Elvismobile blah blah blah coming of age. I found it very easy to put this book down and walk away."
2,"KitchenAid does not mark their accessories well, Amazon does not match accessories well.","I bought a large Kitchenaid food processor some years ago and was so excited that I immediately bought this set of discs, unfortunately the use of the device did not match my excitement and these sat for a year before I got around to using them. My mistake, these are not for the 11 cup processor I have, they are for another model. The confusion comes in that they were listed as an accessory for my model on the page, bad show Amazon. This happens quite often, the lids listed as an accessory for the KitchenaAid Artisan is not the correct model. Now I can't use them, I can't return them, and can't find anyone locally to buy them, my only hope is trying to sell them through the marketplace or ebay. So the moral of the story is, alway unpack your orders and test them immediately. Now I can't use them"
1,Does not fit 9 cup prosessor,"I recently bought a new fp from Amazon as well as this disc set. Upon arrival I found that this set will not fit the new 9 cup fp. I called the vendor and was told that I was wrong and was disconnected. I called kitchenaid and my findings were confirmed. The set only fits an older 9 cup fp. I ordered the set from KitchenAid. The reason I gave the set only one star was for the following reasons. First the set does not fit. Secondly, the vender ( Ace Hardware )was very rude by hanging up."
3,"Some interesting tidbits, but a lot of dross","In general, I have found this work to be of limited use. The author seems to be intent on proving his own prejudices rather than exploring the topic and in many cases, his opinions have largely been disproven.However, I did give the work three stars because the sections on druidic survivals contained information about comparatively late survivals I was unable to find anywhere else. For this reason the serious student of Celtic and Indo-European studies would do well to read this work but only after solid grounding in the topic has been established.Recommended only to a few, and not for beginners on the topic."
5,sublime introduction to a profound worldview,This collection of Krishnamurti's wisdom is organized alphabetically by subject and beautifully displays the man's philosophy of life. Any attempt to summarize the contents of this book would be less than futile- open the book and then open your mind.
5,A Feel Good Movie,"A feel good movie, with a great story line that really shows how we all struggle with life's ups and downs, and how we can have some small semblance of happiness in the end!"
2,A Big Disappointment!,"What a waste of time! I brought this movie because it stars John Phillip Law. I recently viewed ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", and I was impressed with JPL's performance. But, his acting (acting??) in ""Cold Heat"" is horrific, bland and amateurish! The opening sequence looks as though it was shot out of a car window. This entire movie -- from the story line to the acting is pathetic."
1,worst lawn product ever,"I just finished re-doing my lawn after giving patchmaster a month to work, watering twice a day, following all instructions. I've been patching lawns for many years, and I'd swear there was no seed in this product. Not a single blade of grass appeared. Now I'm trying it with grass seed (another brand as Scotts has half the seed other brands have in the package)and top soil. Scotts used to be a quality brand but over the past two years or so, this is no longer the case. Now it's marketing gimmicks and low cost product. Until the quality improves, avoid Scotts products and you'll be glad you did."
1,No good!,Wish I read the reviews before I bought this. The product is an absolute joke. Does not work at all. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Should have seen it coming when it was I sale.
1,Don't waste your time/money,"Simply put I followed the directions while applying to bare spot, watered like clock work for two weeks, and all I have to show for it is a patch covered in Scotts PatchMaster. Not one single blade of grass has developed. I wrote Scotts to complain and they haven't even bothered to respond. Never again."
2,Did not work for me,I put this as directed and I have not seen any grass. It has been months.I am a Ph.D. live in Malibu.
1,Where's the grass?,"I followed the instructions and there are no blades of grass. I think the shredded newspaper does more to impede the growth than to act as a mulch. Now, I have bald spots on the lawn with caked in paper pulp that dries to a paper mache matt. Next time, I'm buying seed and compost. This product was a waste of my time."
1,"Hmm... didn't work for me, BUT...","I'm usually a big fan of Scott's lawn products. I've used the Turf Builder products and Scott's grass seed for years with great results.Last fall there was a nasty grub infestation on my front lawn and the skunks and raccoons destroyed big patches of the lawn while digging up the grubs. I didn't have a chance to replant in the fall, so I tried PatchMaster about a month ago on the bare spots in the lawn. I followed all the instructions regarding ground preparation, application and watering, as I do with all Scott's products... but nothing happened. Nothing. Not a single blade of grass sprouted in any of the re-seeded spots.However... the growing conditions might not have been ideal for re-seeding this year. We have had a horribly rainy and cold spring here in Chicago, and I also noticed the birds were having a feast on the seed as well after I applied the product. I'm willing to bet those two factors affected the results."
3,Patchmaster,it was good but i think it didnt work too well. i do not know about this product helping with the grass if it works so well the grass did not grow as well i put it in several areas and did not get much grass and i watered and followed the directions.
1,Does not work,Bought this product from local Lowe's store. Followed the instructions and have not seen any blade of grass aftera month.
1,Does not grow any grass,14 straight days of watering twice a day and not a single blade of grass. Don't waste your money
2,More Dainty than it looks,"The leather is very thin, but it looks wonderful and is very soft. Unfortunately the strap is also very small. If you're among the larger wristed women, this will not fit comfortably as you'll have to use the very last hole on the strap, if you can fit it on at all.. and you know how that goes (end of strap always coming out of the restrain, poking you, having to tuck it back in).I'd rename this GUESS Little Women's Black Quilted Leather Cuff Watch."
1,Franklin Holman Bible Dictionary,"I found the unit to be not as user friendly as I expected. It's extremely hard to read the screen, even with largest print settings. I would not recommend this product to others and I would have purchased a different model had I known how poor the screen quality is. It may be more user friendly, if you could see what you're doing."
4,Wish it was thicker,"Great Product,Its adjustable so you can tune accordinglyThere is no port noise with a JL 12W7 @ 6000 rmsIts thin, I reinforced it with sound deadening just to add some mass to it"
1,Broke After 2 Weeks,"I purchased this item expecting something similar to the Sedio belt clip I had with my Blackberry. I loved the design and it's capability to hold the iPhone 4 in any direction (front facing in or out and upside down). I was really happy with the texture and the fact that while in the front facing configuration the belt clip acted as a kickstand on a table or desk to watch videos, etc. Bottom line, I loved the case, until it broke. I sat down with it on my hip and suddenly the cheap plastic pins in the belt clip portion both broke off. I didn't drop it or put any strain on it, just simply sat down.I was really happy with this case and would still be if the clip wasn't so easily broken."
3,I Wish I Had Gotten The Fisher Price Garage,I really wasn't very happy with this garage. The ramp broke very quickly and it is hard to get the cars in and out of the elevator. It comes apart and is hard to move around. It was more expensive than the fisher price garage and not as durable.
2,Breaks immediately,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this item for my 2 year old. As others have discovered, the ramp fell apart IMMEDIATELY!!!! It looks nice, but isn't actually much fun to play with - there is nothing connecting the levels other than the clunky elevator, which makes it difficult to access the vehicles."
3,BEWARE- not for 9-cup,"Although I'm sure this juicer works fine, it does not fit the 9-cup processer like the description says. Even the KitchenAid website says it fits the 9-cup. I guess I'll have to buy a standalone juicer. So much for my food processor eliminating the need for extra appliances."
3,"Useful, but has flaws","This product is very useful and works as advertised, but has some flaws to be wary of.Good points:1. I juiced three pears in a little over a minute.2. I don't have to find counter space for a separate juicer.3. I can go from one fruit to the next quickly.Bad points.1. Pressing too hard on the intake tube causes it to brush up against the rotating shredder points on the bottom, causing it to shave off slight bits of plastic. I'm assuming this will be self correcting after using it a couple of times.2. Pear peels tend to accumulate quickly and to thick levels on the mesh sides. I assume apple would too. It made it a bear to clean, even with a good soaking.3. Cleaning means scraping your knuckles on the grater grid on the bottom."
2,For those with 9 cup food processors...,"The juice extractor does FIT the 9 cup fp, as Kitchenaid says, however, it doesn't actually WORK with it. The attachment sits in the bowl just as it should, it spins around, but the food pusher does not reach down far enough to actually make juice out of your veggies. Whatever you drop in will simply go straight through without scraping the bottom, as Kitchenaid says it should, and then spin around like mad without making juice. I spoke with Kitchenaid a couple of times and I am sending it back. I even tried putting in larger chunks but it just won't hold them in place because the pusher and tube extender are not long enough. I also tried a wooden spoon for a pusher but it didn't help due to the shortness of the tube. Bottom line, no matter how bad you want this extractor, like I did, don't get it for a 9 cup processor."
1,I hate it,This attachment vibrates so badly that it about bounces the food processor right off the counter. I love the food processor but I regret having bought the juice extractor.
2,I guess making a quality weight is harder than I thought.,"I bought these weights thinking it would be hard to make a bad weight. I was wrong. The edges are chipped and rough, the plate has some gouges in it, and the paint is sloppy and came off on my hands. I'm guessing they actually weigh the right amount, but I doubt they will fit smoothly with the other plates or rotate evenly (this is important for balance). I would not buy these again."
2,Amazingly Cheap,"2 stars because they way close to ten pounds and they fit on my barbell, other than that these are very cheaply made. Lumpy cast marks and painted by a blind elephant."
5,"Flowers, colour and love","A wonderful wonderful book.Although the book was written some 150 year ago, Mary Eliza Rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in Palestine in the 1850's as if it was occurring today. She writes from her heart with honesty,integrity and a clear mind. And although written at a time of Victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement. From her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the Holy Land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change. For anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book."
5,Veterinarian review,"Ah, finally, a treat that JP, my dog loves. Wellness came out with a ""Pure Rewards"" beef jerky bits for dogs, and these all-natural, tender jerky treats are highly palatable, even to the most discriminating palate. Best of all, the ingredients are easy to understand (which is important), and contain: beef, dried chicory root, cultured whey, sea salt, lecithin, and mixed tocopherols (which is a natural preservative). Four paws up for these tasty treats! Absolutely tasty and palatable!"
1,"The kind of book that gives ""New Age"" a bad name","Pint-sized and poorly written, this guide would be a great gift for someone you dislike. After all, you're just trying to say, ""Get outta here!"" right?Besides the numbingly dull text, the author sucks the lifeblood out of travel saying it's the interior journey that counts.This is the kind of book that gives ""New Age"" a bad name."
3,Good ....but not for eveyone,"I liked this DVD even though it is somewhat slow and predictable. The story is interesting and well told. It's basically a story about a man who has repressed his emotions and stopped taking chances because of a traumatic childhood event. The details of this film are enticing, and the memories haunting. It is a rather dark and heavy movie, and the end is bittersweet but satisfying. I'm glad I watched it."
5,Till Human Voices Wake Us,"This was an excellent deeply psychological movie. The stars were well-casted. The acting was terrific. It was a little slow in the beginning, but I think that set the stage for the development of the plot. The flashbacks were inserted in just the right way to stimulate my attention and make me feel the mystery."
3,You listen but you don't speak,"Maybe it's just me, but with the information provided with this product, I thought ""I"" would be able to speak the word or phrase I needed translated. ""What a great idea,"" I thought. No, one does not speak into it, but rather listens as the communicator speaks canned phrases back to the listener/purchaser. So, I guess that's alright - certainly helps with pronunciation - but I'm disappointed that the product was not what I was expecting it to be. In addition, I will never order anything from this company again. I am still waiting for my money back, and it has been almost six months. My emails are not responded to, their promises of emails to me are not kept, and I am the one who has to continue to call long distance to seek my payment. I seem to be unable to change my initial rating of this product and its company, so I'll do it now. I hereby change my rating to ONE star."
5,"Original, Spiky, and Beautiful","This CD is great from top to bottom... These guys and girl have a great knack for melodic power pop/rock and can give it to you with a sledgehammer or a teaspoon... Great use of dynamics, space, and some (great) guitar and drum work. Some of the tracks are uptempo and muscular, others are slower, spacy, and have a trip-hop sort of vibe. The singer has a unique voice which could really help this band to appeal to more than just rock fans.Do yourself a favor and check out moodroom."
5,Entrancing Sax,"I had the immense pleasure of coming across this cd quite by chance a couple of months ago. I remember slipping on the headphones in the Virgin Records Store to listen to the first couple of tracks, I was entranced and could have listened to the entire cd there and then. Rarely does a jazz cd grip me so! The mellow tenor sax playing is quite superb. One of those cd's you cant help but toe tap to whether your a jazz fan or not.A definate must for the collection of any self respecting jazz fan!"
5,PERFECT !,"These are perfect. They have feet as pictured and they clean up like a charm. I have used them 50+ times to bake escargot with coconut oil and lots of powdered(yes) garlic and no matter how messy the dishes look when they come out of the oven, they look spotless and perfect after some hot soapy water.For escargot lovers, these are highly recommended !"
3,Not quite as pictured,"OK, they are functional and cheap, but they do not have the ""feet"" pictured in the item description. The dishes rest directly on the depressions for the snails. You would probably use a service plate under them anyway, so it's not like it's a huge problem.The item looks more like this: Escargot Dish"
3,plate,"Was hoping this plate was a little larger than I got, but its really teeny tiny!You almost need 3 for a whole meal!Quality and shipping was fast and easy, just wish the size was a little larger!"
1,not happy,"The design is beautiful but the size is not what was described or what I needed. it is advertised as 6"" by 6"" and it is not. when it arrived it is only 3"" by 3 3/8"". This is not correct advertising and it caused me to buy a product that was not right for my intended use."
4,A useful and enlightening look at the origins of the modern map,"It's easy to look at the history of maps as a sort of progression from the ""primitive"" to the ""sophisticated"", in which the creation of the modern scientific survey in the eighteenth century marks the biggest turning point. As much of the scholarship over the last 20 years points out though, the history of maps is a tangled web, just as maps are a tangled combination art and science, politics and nature, selectivity and objectivity. David Buisseret does an admirable job of sorting out the strands that came together in the modern survey, and traces them back into the late middle ages, so we can see them emerging not miraculously from the forehead of superstition, but organicallay as the way people saw, governed, and thought changed in the Renaissance and the century or so following. A thought provoking read."
1,These reviews are very suspicious,"How can it be that so many of the reviews for this product are identical stylistically and free of grammatical errors? They seem to have been written by an advertising agency, which makes me very suspicious. I was going to buy this product, but now I'm wondering what's going on."
5,Heavy-duty and very quiet,"I am very impressed by the construction of this food processor. Everything about it is very sturdy, even the plastic bowls. I saw in another Amazon review that it was quiet, but I was still surprised by how quiet. I didn't even have to raise my voice to talk over it as I made my first batch of Alton Brown Turbo Hummus. I really like that it came with the mini-bowl for small jobs. Wonderful product."
5,Absolutely Perfect!,I don't know if it's the name brand or what but I love this food processor. I love the color and like having it on the counter with my red mixer. The attachments are easy to change. I grated some cheese in no time flat. It is a solid unit. Very heavy.
3,"good appliance, poor accessories","The appliance is very good--we bought ours several years ago. However, the large ""bowl"" is made of plastic and the little pieces that push the plunger to start the thing have broken one by one--we now need to either buy a new processor or get replacement parts. Otherwise, I highly recommend it."
1,"Poor design of work bowl, customer service unresponsive","I have had this item for 3 years and the plastic on plastic design of the work bowl and lid deteriorated and cracked. When I ordered a new lid, it became stuck on the work bowl and would not budge. Customer service told me I ""put it on wrong"" and to try to get them apart and ""hope I only broke the lid"" When I emailed their customer service, I was given instructions on how to put the lid on (As if I hadn't been using it for 3 years!) Now I will have to order not only a new lid plus a new work bowl to the tune of another $50 to be able to use it! Other than that, I am satisfied :("
5,The best out there,"After all these years, my LaMachine finally bit the dust. During my test drive of the new machines out there, nothing could compare to the Kitchen Aid. It's quiet, easy to clean and chops, shreds like a breeze. Easter dinner for 12 was a snap with this new helper in the kitchen."
2,"KitchenAid should stick with what they do best, mixers","I purchased this unit a year or two ago. Right after the warrantee ended a small piece of plastic on the cover broke rendering the unit useless. I called for a new cover and it is on back order---at least 3 months. No good. The customer service staff insist it isn't a design flaw, however, with a back order of this magnitude I challenge this comment. The unit worked okay before this occured, however, the lid is very difficult to clean after use with most items. I have several KitchnAid products and love them, but I would strongly recommend another brand when it comes to food processors."
4,An (Almost) First-class Food Processor,"There was a lot of available power in this unit which is the most important consideration when buying a food processor. I thought the ""pressure pad"" design used for selecting the speed of operation could be improved. That's the reason this model from KitchenAid didn't rate 5 stars from this cook. I didn't like the ""pressure pad"" concept used for the speed settings as they tend to limit the versatility of product somewhat. The colour choices however, are wonderful and there's a colour to compliment any kitchen decor."
4,Four and Half Stars,"In a word, I love it. I bought the KitchenAid stand mixer earlier and it's a toss up which I like better. For a lot of the smaller mixing jobs I will use the processor instead. It is a joy to use. The control panel only has 3 buttons ? Off, On and Pulse. Forget the hype of the 10 speed models. An On button is all you need if the power is there, and in this processor there is power to spare.The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the attachment case does not have room for the full complement of optional discs. If you buy the optional 5 disc set for the processor (I did) then you have no easy storage. The attachment case is a nice touch but just not large enough."
3,Not up to Cuisinart,"This replaced our cuisinart, but it is not as good. Although it has more power, the design is poor for grating cheese. It gets caught, and is dificult to clean. However, it does do many jobs well."
3,Too Old,The book is a bit outdated. I should have checked the copyright dates. My fault. Shame on me. It's like trying to repair a computer using Windows 3.1 Thats pretty far back.
4,SOLD ADVICE,In a world where need is immediate this books takes a jeweler back to solid principles of the basics. It is excellent time proven methods of repair.
4,Classic.,I used to rent this from the local grocery store over and over as a child. Most sales here are cartridge only on this sort of system but you can find boxes for cheap enough through eBay anymore.
5,Haunting and Beautiful to Listen To,"I ordered the combination video, CD, and book from the television when the movie came out, and I mainly started to listen to the CD for the last song, the theme song 'Wish Upon a Star'. All of the songs are beautiful though none of them have words, but they're all powerful and have a mysterious haunting quality which is cool to listen to.My final opinion: I like it, but if you didn't like to listen to classical or symphonic music, then I don't think that you would like it."
5,A magical world,"This CD makes me cry. Especially the one called ""Wishing on a Star."" I love it so much. I wish really really bad that what happened to Virgina would happen to me. That would make me so extremely happy. This world is so boring."
4,I LOVE THE 10TH KINGDOM!!!!!,*ahem* sorry :) I have watched the movies (all versions) like 5 times each....I'm a bit obsessed. I know the WHOLE movie by heart. *sighs* Obsession naturally drew me to the soundtrack. I adore it :) I listen to it during class when I have nothing to do....it's beautiful *sniffs* Just beautiful :) The only part about the soundtrack that I don't like is that some of the songs are really dark and some of them just sound the same....but that's it :)
3,"Where is the rest of the song ""Wishing on a star""??","I love the music, BUT we have the lyrics to ""Wishing on a Star"" and the song on this CD isn't the whole song. I feel cheated too. Where can I get the whole song?? Thats the only reason I bought it."
1,CD the 10th Kingdom,I am very disapointed. I bought this CD for the song Wishing on a Star and it is only 1:21 I thought there would be a longer version on the CD. I feel cheated. If anyone knows if there is a longer version out there please Let us know.
4,"Intriguing, Fascinating And Effective.","""Citizen Cohn"" is like Anthony Sommer's ""Official And Confidental: The Secret Life Of J.Edgar Hoover,"" it examines the true perverse and sinister nature of a respected public figure. James Woods gives a venomous, great performance like Bob Hoskins as Hoover in Oliver Stone's ""Nixon."" The film is really intriguing and fascinating. It serves as a study of politics in the McCarthy era through the 60s. Roy Cohn was obviously no saint and the film dwelves into his secret, perverse nature in a fascinating way. This movie is a mind-opener that raises many issues and uncovers the dark truth about not only Cohn, but about the era in which he lived. It seems he, like Hoover, was a personifacation of everything perverse in the system. Is it surprising he died of AIDS?"
4,McCarthy's right hand man,"James Woods gives a riveting performance of Roy Cohn, the lawyer at the center of the US communist witch hunts of the early 1950s. The spoiled brat and closet gay on whom Joe McCarthy so naively relied is shown in a series of flashbacks from his hospital bed in the 1980s. The pace is fast with characters such as Bobby Kennedy, Walter Winchell and Ethel Rosenberg popping up here and there to shed light on Cohn's selfish character. Cohn's habit of helping himself at meals to other people's plates, notably Cardinal Spellman's, sums him up precisely. Naturally, there are moot points. There is, for example, no real evidence Cohn was David Schine's lover and Cohn's relationship with his father was more complex than the comtempt shown in the movie. No matter. Cohn's ability to ruin other people whilst serving his own career and bank balance is succinctly portrayed in an excellently written script."
5,"Well illustrated, No hassle book",Nice book with easy approaches & techniques for mobilisation. Can practise by referring the book
5,Just getting Soultaker alone is worth the price in gold!,"I have been waiting for Soultaker for years, so I ordered this asap. With performances from Joe Estevez, Robert Z'Dar (Tango & Cash, Maniac Cop) and Chuck Williams (Bubba Ho-Tep) it's worth it's wait in gold."
4,Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume XIV,"The second MST3K DVD box set by Shout! Factory. This set contains four episodes from the show. Two episodes are from the Comedy Central-era of the show. The other two are from the Sci-Fi Channel-era. Two feature Joel Robinson as host. The other two feature Mike Nelson as host. This was the second MST3K box set that I ever got. I was extremely excited when I received it. This set also contains a few special features including a trailer for one of movies. It also contains two new interviews with Joe Estevez and Greydon Clark. This set contains four mini posters which are the covers of the indiviual DVD cases for the episodes. I would recommend this set to any ""MSTie."" It's great fun."
5,enjoyed it,"What can I say, funny stuff. I've been a fan of MST3000 since it first started on cable and am happy to be able to watch Joel and the bots again. I never get tired of them."
1,Nope it not enough,"I loved MST3K and watched it religiously for years, however a set with only 4 episodes is a ripoff, considering other TV programs are offering entire seasons for their shows priced similiarly. I will never buy any of this until entire seasons are available. Only one TV series is more of a ripoff DVD wise, and that is Bill Nye the Science Guy."
3,A little overwhelming,"I Purchased this text to help bridge the gap between Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Applied Kinetics, unfortunately this book is difficult to dive into. The content is excellent, has everything you need to know about irreversible process the problem is just that. I find it hard to just open this text, find a topic, and read about it. The derivations are complete but are lacking steps that a newcomer to the topic might want to see. Format is OK, would have been nice if the publisher updated this edition with less text on each page (i.e. larger font and pages). This is a hit or miss; I think it really depends on your background. If you're coming from a fluid mechanics background this might be well suited for you."
1,Kitchenaid 6 disk storage unit,This product did NOT work for us. We put it on the back of one of our kitchen cabinet doors. Whenever we closed the cabinet door some of the disks were jarred out into the cabinet. If we opened the door too quickly it slung the disks out as the door opened. This unit will only work on a fixed solid surface. We didn't have any fixed solid surface to hang it. It ended up on a shelf out in our garage. Anyone want to make us an offer on it?
5,Kitchenaid Food Processor Disk Storage,"Conveniently stacks disks for Food processor. I installed it on the wall beside my food processor, so when I need a disk it's right there. Don't have to search for it. Great idea!"
3,Not using,"I believe I would have liked this better if I had a deep drawer to install it into along with other blades which do not fit into this, spindle extra bowl, etc. I am using the simplest cheapest solution and have never mounted this. I have three bowls inside a drawer which organize the various shapes of blades ( some have two blades for my smaller bowl on the kitchenaide 9 cup)"
3,"This could have been a ""great"" book","This book could have been a ""great"" history on the problems faced by and of the LAPD.Too many unsubstantiated comments turned this book into just another ""axe to grind"" slam against the LAPD. Comments such as (found in Part 5 Circling the Wagons, Chaper 2 The Protege)""And in the years to follow it would be his policies-along with Ronald Reagan's war on the poor..."" is one example of his use of unsubstantiated claims found through out his book.This could have been a great book if he focused on ""just the facts"" and backed his personal comments & opinion with facts."
2,A disappointment...,"What could have been an authoritative, definitive history of the LAPD instead disintegrated into a police-bashing screed by Mr. Domanick. His obvious biases prevented any kind of dispassioned, reasoned analysis of the LAPD; instead, Mr. Domanick merely spewed the tired liberal dogma of ""bad police"", of the police as simply ""the Man"" trying to keep folks down. His historical accounting of the LAPD was so tainted by his personal animus that reading this account was painful. A big disappointment for a topic worthy of insightful, reasoned anaysis."
2,Good Historical Information...but.....,"I gave this book 2 stars only because the historical information was well-researched and interesting. I did like reading about training, etc. from ""back in the day"". But...the biggest problem I have with this book is that the writer's anti-police attitude keeps getting in the way. If he doesn't like the LAPD, that's fine, it's his opinion, but such antics as writing sarcastic comments about ""the look"" of police officer's familes really left a bad taste in my mouth. I bought this book thinking it would be an ""objective"" history of the LAPD. I was greatly disappointed by Domanick's constant tirades that painted all LAPD officers with the same brush."
1,Total trash from a cop hating worm,"Joe Domanick HATES police officers. Joe Domanick HATES the LAPD. Joe Domanick is a moron. These three facts literally leap of the first few pages at the reader. All hope of an honest, open-minded, appraisal of the LAPD are completely lost once the reader realizes Domanick has a personal vendetta against the police. Likely resulting from his own run-ins with the law? Who knows! Caveat Emptor!"
1,Cop bashing garbage,"I read this book twice, and the conclusion I came to is that Joe Domanick hates police. What starts of as a good history of the LAPD, turns into a blatant attack on the department and the men and women who serve under it. Domanick fails to realize that some of the ""brutal"" tactics and procedures of the department were acceptable in the early half of this century. You can read the LA Times every day and find as much cop-baiting as you do in this book, without the price tag. I only gave it one star because it had some good history info."
2,Do not buy,I have no idea how this product is still on the market. The points of the pick are so sharp they can cut you. There is no way to use this on your hair without hurting your head. I do not recommend it at all.
5,Great for natural curly hair,"I have natural curly hair and this help to separate the curl so it looks great. These are hard to find, so just know when you find one get it.If you girls do big hair the is good to fill in you holes in the back and sides."
2,Rough return,"Definitely a return to the ""unrefined"" sound of their earlier work, but there is a similar regression in the quality of the songs. I have found only 2-3 songs on this album that warrant repeat listening."
4,Good but takes time to dry,Very good gloves for cold weather. Pretty good to cut wind. Only problem : those gloves don't breathe and there are long to dry (4 or 5 days when the interior is very wet).
5,Extra toasty hands!,"I've got 4 different pairs of gloves to wear on cold rides. When it gets really cold (below 20 degrees fahrenheit) I exclusively wear these gloves. They are very well insulated and keep out the wind. I just finished a ride in 22 degree weather with 2"" of snow and a wind chill of 10 degrees, my hands were comfortable the entire time. Get these gloves if you like warm hands. P.S. You also get to look like a weird crab person, an added bonus to elicit stares in your local coffee shop."
3,Both Hot and Cold,"I like the design and feel of these gloves, but I find the performance frustrating. I find my hands sweating in the gloves while my fingers are still cold. It may just be my bad circulation in my advanced age of 53. I do not find them warm enough for sub-20F conditions on a bike. Above 40 they are too warm."
5,Excellent cool weather gloves,"Had a chance to try out these gloves for a 1 hour ride today, and they are impressive. In low 40s temps, bright sun and moderate effort on level terrain, I found my hands actually sweating a bit w/these gloves. They are very comfortable, and their 'lobster claw' grouping of the pinkie and ring finger works very well - one thing to be aware of, when you put them on for the first time, is that the inner lining actually has 5 individual 'fingers', and it is only the outer shell that lumps the pinkie and ring fingers together. Also, repeating what at least one other reviewer mentioned, they do seem to run a little large - I often need XL gloves, but for these gloves, the L size fit perfectly.Well-designed and well-built - highly recommended."
1,Don't waste your money,"While touted to be very warm these gloves are not. After 30-45min mountain bike rides in 25-30F temps, my fingers were cold, with fingertips numb! Also, once hands get a little sweaty the gloves adhere making them hard to take off or put on. These are not good winter bike gloves! If I could send them back I would, but have used them once so I'll have to eat the loss. I'll look for something better."
4,Fat and Warm,"These gloves are huge and fat. You don't really get an idea from the picture how big they are. Picture ski gloves and you'll have an idea how big they are.The sizing for these unisex gloves are fine. I'm female and usually wear a medium in men's. These gloves in medium fit me fine. Keep in mind that there are two layers to the glove. The inner layer, a fleece glove, is what fits me fine as a medium. The outer layer is bigger of course, to fit over the inner layer. You could wear the outer layer alone without the inner liner but you must expect it to be larger and fit loosely without the inner liner to fill it out.These gloves are definitely for winter weather in my experience. They are too warm for fall/40 degree and above weather and cause my hands to sweat after a few minutes of riding.The fused ring and pinky finger section addresses a big problem I get where my last two fingers freeze. I think that's a great feature."
4,Not as warm as expected,"Comfortable gloves, but not as warm as I had hoped for. My hands got cold on a 40 ride the other day (there was also a major headwind). However, once the temps warmed up about 5 degrees and the wind died down, the hands/fingers stayed toasty warm. In short, these do not block wind well."
2,not so great,completely worn out in the palm and fingers. used a little more than 1 season and the gloves are completely coming apart
4,Warm but not that warm,I was looking for a warm pair of gloves. This one are ok for 35+ degrees. I was looking for a pair of gloves to ride comfortable in the winter. These ones are ok. The liner is a little annoying.
5,Terrific,"These gloves single-handedly got me through winter biking this year. I love the design and the feel. And paired with the fleece liners, I had no problem biking with these in freezing temps for an hour or more. Below freezing, though, and my fingers started to really feel the cold after about a half an hour. As for the sizing, I'm a pretty average-hand-sized guy and the large was definitely the way to go. If I wanted to wear these without liners, a medium might have fit better, but I needed these to be big enough to fit over a liner."
5,Excellent winter riding gloves,"These gloves are very well made. When I first saw them out the box, I though they looked too big and bulky for bike riding gloves. They are actually quite comfortable. The four finger design is only on the outside, the inner lining is a 5 finger design which is easy to remove and reinstall.Although these gloves do not interfere in shifting gears, they do make it a bit difficult to do more finer things like turn on my bike headlights. I guess it takes some getting used to.As far as cold weather protection goes, these gloves are excellent. However, I have only taken these gloves on evening rides where the temp was down to about 37 degrees and they kept my hands very warm with excellent wind chill resistance and comfort. I am very pleased with these gloves and recommend them."
3,"Good, but not enough padding",These gloves are fairly warm but I find that glove liners are best when riding in the low 30's. They could also use more padding.Besides that I would still call these a good buy.
1,Not for Winter!,Yes as stated they do work well in the fall. but as for anything below 40F with wind. they just don't cut it. There's always wind here in germany when I ride in the winter which makes these gloves unusable until the weather warms a bit! I read the other reviews and thats why I bought these gloves. I was even sucked in by the pics lol! they are pretty though. Anyways look for somthing warmer if you can!
2,I should be giving these one star...,"But I agree with the other 2 star reviews. I've use these ONCE (once is enough, as they are at the peak of their condition, and they don't function correctly). I also bike to work, and its about a 4.5 mile bike each way. It was ~25 degrees out this morning, and i figured I'd go to these, my ""winter"" gloves from my thinner fall gloves.Halfway through my ride, my wrists and hands were getting sweaty, while my middle finger, index finger, and thumb were all halfway to numb. They are certainly not windproof, and judging by the look of the material (this is not confirmed, as it wasn't raining this morning) they wouldn't be very waterproof either (there is plenty of felt-y material on the gloves).Do not buy; they wouldn't be useful in any temperature condition, since at 25 degrees, the hands are too hot (which would remain the same for any temperature above this) and the fingers are too cold (which would be true for any temperature below this)."
5,Great Winter Glove...Great Price,"I could not ask for a better winter and cold weather bike glove. These are extremely comfortable, have the flexibility I want and wear very well. They are easy to get on and off. The grip is absolutely great. I would not advise wearing these in even mild warm weather though as your hands will sweat. The liners work quite well and if you have any difficulty with them, a stick works just fine putting them back into place. The price of these gloves is great...you are getting a lot of glove for relatively little money."
5,"Very warm, well designed","I thought I would have a problem with the ""four-finger"" type design, but ti actually works very well for biking. They do a fantastic job of keeping my hands warm, and I've found myself wearing them off the bike too. I havn't run into an issue with them being too warm either."
5,Very Comfortable,These gloves are very comfortable and work well for me below freezing to above 50 degrees(F).
4,Minor Flaws,"These are pretty decent cold weather biking gloves. The little fingers being combined is nice, and the reflective details are a bonus. The grips on the palms are good. The velcro on the wrists gets caught on a lot of stuff, and has resulted in some cloth damage on the gloves, and the sleeves of my jacket. It could be fixed with a bigger flap that would cover the velcro more completely."
3,Good for cool days. Not for freezing days.,"In my opinion, these are decent riding gloves for the 40 to 55 degree Fahrenheit range.I wore them Today on a 30 degree day (that feels like 18) and my hands were too cold.These use Velcro to tighten around the wrist, and I am not crazy about that. The Velcro (if not perfectly positioned) will mark up/increase the wear and tear on the wrist area and any of your other Lycra garments that it comes into contact with. Having to make sure none of my garments are in contact with the Velcro is a pain."
3,"Clunky, not warm when it counts","Okay, so the liners were awesome for all of Autumn, and the big clunky ninja turtles hands were great when the temperature dipped to 30/20s. But below 20? Forget about it! And don't bother putting them on until you've done every possible thing you can think to do with your fingers: snap your bike helmet on, snap your backpack on, lock your door with your keys, etc... really hard to do with the big gloves on. I'll be shopping for a warmer pair that hopefully allows more mobility."
2,Not Waterproof,"Pros+ Good fit+ Good exterior grip+ Good interior comfot+ Four finger design is a good balance of warmth and controlCons- Lack of water proofing pretty much defeats the purpose of warm all-weather biking gloveIf by some chance, you're in a place that's cold but never wet, these might be a good option. If you're exposed to snow or rain, these gloves appear useless. I returned them and exchanged for the slightly less versatile but waterproofSugoi Firewall Z Glove."
2,Ineffective at near freezing,"This is a bulky glove but it is ineffective at near zero and below. Even with a wool liner my fingers are in agony after 15 minutes of riding at a moderate pace (and hence moderate wind chill). No wind protection at all. OK for 35-45, but even then it may be possible to get as much protection with a lighter glove,"
5,Completely exceeded my expectations.,Some of the warmest cycling gloves I've ever worn. I have poor circulation so the pinky and ring fingers are the first to freeze up up for me. The connect finger style glove works great to prevent that and it's even better that your middle and pointer finger are still free. These gloves come with a pair of fleece liners as well which I haven't even had to use yet and I've been riding in temps as low as 28 F so these should be good enough for almost any winter imaginable. The price is great as well.
3,Planet Bike Borealis Fall/Winter Full Finger Gloves,"The gloves are fantastic, but I ordered the gloves on December 8th for a Christmas present, and they did not arrive until the 26th ... obviously too late for Christmas. Also - the tracking number did not work, it kept saying, ""Carrier notified to pick up package"" until after it had been delivered... so I had no idea what the status was. Overall - love the gloves, and I'm not really sure if I would buy from them again... I certainly would NEVER make a purchase that I needed by a certain date (i.e. a present), as they don't seem to be very organized."
5,Nice gloves!,"I ordered these gloves to allow me to reach my brakes when I cycle in cold weather. However, I also found them so comfy to wear that I also where them for evening winter walks and dog-walking duties. They are warmer than my bulkier ski gloves and allow me greater dexterity than my mittens. Of course, they are great on the bike allowing me to operate the brake levers easily without bulk or overheating. I'm very happy with this purchase!"
1,Not for Winter---Maybe for Fall weather,"Gloves do not keep out the wind-chill at all. They say they are for the winter/fall and are supposed to be windproof/weatherproofI'm sure they work great in the fall (50-60ish degrees) but in the winter they fail miserably.If you are wearing good glove liners, I'm sure that would work just fine with these, but come on, we are living the future here and we still can't get a pair of gloves that actually keep your hands warm despite the temperature outside?I used them once, hand was frozen within 2 miles of use, against wind on a 30- degree evening. I commute to and from work on a bike, it's a 3 mile ride each way, I shouldn't have freezing hands in that short amount of time.I returned them and bought another pair that hopefully will do the trick."
3,snuggly,"Received a pair of these cloves for Christmas. They are great, keep hands warm and dry. I would suggest ordering a size up from what you think you need. They seem to run a bit on the small side."
1,Not worth the money,The gloves are overpriced for their temperature range. My fingers get numb if the temperatureis in 30s. Protection wise it is not better than my $8 Burlington coat factory gloves.
3,Sort of OK,"I would give it 2.5 if I could.They keep your hands warmer than if they were bare. That's it.The lining has already torn on the left pinkie finger as well as the right index finger. Annoying. My sewing kit can fix this.Mine turned when they went in the wash (also giving a better fit).HOW TO TURN THEM INSIDE OUT: Pull them all the way out until they're dry or whatever you wanted. Actually It's important that they dry out entirely to reduce friction. Push the fingers back in until they are inside the main ""body"" of the hand. Put your fingers in. Then, grab the collar of the glove with your free hand whilst simultaneously slowly and gently pushing in all the fingers into their correct place."
4,For detox of blood,This was recommended to help detox my blood and body from excess toxins.. I am sort of neutral-- because I am better but not sure if this was the product that helped-- Large pill to take
5,"A great novel, which is a MUST for all.","For anybody who has ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors at an airport must read Hailey's masterpiece; Airport. It involves many unvolding plots throughout, and at the finale all intertwine into a great climax. One of the best thriller books ever written."
4,WORTHWHILE,"Airport was the first Hailey book I read.The first thing that caught my attention was the easy way in which the author had brought down his characters.Normal and downto earth they make you wish you were one of them.Thrilling,exiting and imaginative it is one of the books I read whenever I feel like it. I recommend another book by the same author ""MONEY CHANGERS"" which will give the same exitement."
1,Dull,"This was the hardest book I ever read; not because of difficult language or complexity but sheer volume of endless, ultimately pointless text that muffles the plot. The book's over 300 pages long and very little of note happens until the last 50 or so pages; there are so many characters and storylines that I ended up not caring much about any of them. And the amount of filler is staggering; the author spends several sides explaining the airline policy on stewardesses who are made pregnant by pilots. Of course, the research Hailey has done can't be faulted, and it certainly gives an insight into the running of an airport, but honestly after 200-odd pages of adultery, marital discord, delays, airline stowaways, 'feisty' employees who remove all the capital letters from their typewriters and flippant stewardesses planning seductions in Naples, I really couldn't care less what happened in the end. Don't bother."
2,"Good for XP, NOT useless for Vista","In XP, this thing was great. I upgraded to Vista, and now the outputs have an unacceptable pop and crackle. The Line6 forums are all abuzz about this problem, and there is no solution yet.<edit> I heartily apologize. There was no solution at Line6, but I eventually ran across a fix. Unsurprisingly, Vista is to blame, specifically the power profiles on Vista. The fault lay in the processor power-state transitions. This works ok on Vista on a laptop if you select the ""Always On"" power state. (Actually, there's an occasional pop even then; if you disable power state transitions in your BIOS, I think you can get rid of them.)My apologies, and I revise my rating to four stars."
5,The best ABC book,"Keeps infant/toddler hooked on! Has multiple objects for a letter on one page like Apple, Airplane...and Balloon, bucket, butterfly, ball which really makes this book unique. Highly recommend."
4,Scream 3 score review,"I bought the original Scream album, which was good but I was hoping for more of a musical/score type of cd instead of grunge rock. Well my friends, Scream fans can finally have their score with this cd. It has ever gut wrenching, startling piece of music from the original Scream plus the new music in Scream 3. The only reason this cd doesn't deserve a 5 star is that out of the 20 tracks listed on the album, only 4 or 5 of them last longer then 1:30. This disappoints a little but if your not looking at the track number you'd never know that a new track had started because it flows nicely into each new track. This cd will be great for spooky halloween music to scare the trick or treaters."
4,"""I'm talking about being scared!""","Looking for some creepy music? Pick the ""Scream 3"" score. It packs 20 frightening tracks from one of the year's best films. A downfall to the CD might be the fact that this CD is way too short. The disc runs only an estimated 35 minutes. Though missing a few essential scores, such as Sidney getting shot, the CD does send chills down your spine."
5,Huge!,This is great for older children if you have enough students. The only problem that we had was using it with younger children. We had a four-year-old on each handle and they weren't strong enough to use even really light beach balls on it.
2,Too small,This canopy is too small for the kids to enjoy. Items that you bounce on top fall off quickly and the canopy is not big enough for the kids to go under to make a mushroom. I only have 2 children and it was still too small. Get at least the next size up.
4,Cloud Nine,"Whether or not you are a Temptations fan, you will definitely enjoy this album. Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks are exceptional. Listening to ""I Need Your Loving"" will make you remember why you began a relationship with that special someone. I thought the Temps would be a lesser group without David Ruffin, but this album/CD proved me wrong. You will thoroughly enjoy it!"
5,a new member different sound still the greatest,"David left enter Dennis a new era, the greatness continues. The songs changed with the times songs were moving from 2 to 3 minute format to over 9 minutes of Run Away Child. Everybody started to sing lead on each song yet not only did it work but they got more popular moving from the top soul group to the top group. Of course the times were changes the line between forms of became smaller even Miles was leading the jazz world into the fusion era. I always loved something the Duke Ellington once said ""there is only two kinds of music, good and bad."" Well the music on this cd is not only good but it is very good and stands the test of time."
4,Good beginners tool...,"This is the first all-in-one graphics solution I've bought, and it's not that bad. It's not as complete as the Illustrator / Photoshop combo, but it does the job. I recommend this program for any first time graphics users, it extremely easy to learn."
5,Joe McQ is great,This should be mandatory reading if you are working the 12 Steps. Very down to earth and easy reading. Worked well with the 12x12 also.
1,Absolutely unnecessary,"Just follow the instructions in the Big Book. Theirs is not a helpful approach, and you are likely to get off track with the basic objectives of the AA program. Much of this is trite, some is dead wrong and a lot of it just has little to do with the Steps but a lot to do with their opinions and religious views. That's my experience after watching people struggle with the Joe and Charlie material over my 19 years of sobriety."
4,Simplicity Explained,"I found this book to be, not only easy to navigate, but also a real ""eye-opener"" into the complex issue of Alcoholism. Being a recovering alcoholic myself, I would have given anything to have had this book much, much earlier in my sobriety. It clearly lays out the processes to identifying the personal faults associated with alcoholism and how to address them in a format that is genuinely unique, insightful, and most of all, easy to understand. Joe McQ's expertise is refreshing, yet to the point and would be a boon to all who seek help in understanding how to work ""the steps"". Special attention is paid to Steps IV & V, which include diagrams for exploring one's inner self; a tool I found most useful in identifying the ""exact nature"" of the wrongs we had committed and why they blocked us from contact with our ""Higher Power"". Overall, the book is factual, concise, and easily doable.Kudos, Mr. McQ, kudos."
4,Solid companion to the big book,"OK, I can forgive the anonymity break. Joe should have known better than the photo on the back.This is good stuff. Helps simplify the step work. However, I gave it four stars cause it could be simpler still. Joe (and his sidekick Charlie) have done wonderful stuff, but here and there in the book they get a little too wrapped up in espousing on their own wisdom. The result is that the descriptions of actions get tangled. It's not often, but just enough to deduct one star off this rating.However, this book is worth every penny....and cost less than a good bottle of Stoli :-)"
5,The Best !,"If you are looking for an understanding to AA's 12 steps, look no more. Joe McQ's, ""The Steps We Took"" makes the steps come alive. After reading and ""working"" the steps I have a much better understanding of myself and look forward to yet another read in anticipation of continued growth and awareness of who I am and the journey I am on. I encourage any and all to experience this ""gift""."
3,"okay, but limited","Like all Big Book fundamentalist approaches to sponsorship and life, this book is limited by the limitations to the understandings available to AA members by 1939. God did not retire at that point, and, as promised, more is being revealed.While effective for the first five steps, this book is limited to BB approaches, and so we get two paragraphs worth of Steps 6 & 7.Its fundamentalism also seems to limit Joe's willingness to direct people to other readings that would help them recognize the absolute humanity of struggling to surrender character defects.""The decision to live on a spiritual basis or to die an alcoholic death is not always an easy one."" The lesson of Step 2 applies to all subsequent steps, and certainly to Steps 6, 7, and 8. Unfortunately,the fundamentalist approach in this book suffers from ""progress bias""; once we get past each step, it is treated as background, and only the step at hand is treated.This is a good reference, but not a guide to sponsorship."
4,Starting Soundtrack,"This past year really hasn't brought out anything new into R&B.; But while the songs from Ciara, Beyonce' and others feel like second nature, there have been a few surprises. Newcomer Deemi has really stretched her voice very well with her opening single, Soundtrack Of My Life. The song is very upbeat and strong. She has a feeling that is similar to what we've heard from Alicia Keys, and that is felt with the urban beats on this song. I really love this song on the radio, and I really am eager to see what comes up with the record. This soundtrack is really worth listening too.Song: B+"
5,Son was so excited,I bought these for my sons birthday party grab bags. I have never seen him so ecited. They were exactly what I needed!
2,Novelty that loses appeal quickly!,These are cute dog tags which I purchased for my son. He liked them and was able to keep track of them for about 1 day and then lost interest.
4,Did David Murray ever make a bad record?,"None that I've heard, and I've bought at least most of them for the past several years. The key feature of Murray's recordings is the JOY you can hear in his playing. While FAST LIFE is not one of his greatest recordings, the joy is present here. And the recording represents what must have been a failed attempt to make elusive Japanese DIW (label) CDs available on Columbia -- so this is sure to be more available than many Murray titles. If you don't know Murray's work, this may be the most affordable introduction you'll find, though ""Shakill's Warriors,"" ""Ming's Samba,"" or ""The Long Goodbye"" might be the very best starting points."
1,"No salt, no pepper, no flavor",In this version of stone soup they forgot the salt. It is about a boy who visits an old woman and somehow cons her into feeding him. The original stone soup teaches teamwork and neighborly love.
1,Pick a Stone Soup book with different drawings.,"The classic tale is great, of course, but this particular version of it has illustrations that are simply too scary and weird for young children. A child can make no sense of the pins and needles stuck in the old woman's bottom (back of dress), and the old lady herself often looks like a witch. Pick this tale in a book with better drawings."
4,Just Like I remember it....sort of,"My grandmother bought this book for me when I was little and from that day on, all I wanted for dinner was Stone Soup! LOL :) It's a little flimsier than I remember, but I guess every book seems huge when you're 7 or 8yrs old. Either way, I still enjoyed seeing it again and will make sure my kids get to read this book and help me make Stone Soup for supper!"
2,Disapointing,I really am not happy with this purchase. It is not comfortable under my neck. It does not give enough support. Also the shipping charge was excessive.
1,More slag from China,"Working for an obnoxious boss for many years has helped to beget a chronic crick in the cape. In other words, my neck hurts a lot. I have long enjoyed the winsome comfort that can be experienced as one reclines upon a pure down pillow injected with a foam and fabric neck roll. If you have trouble walking the straight and narrow during the day, at least you can be straight at night; for this really does keep the neck and spine properly alligned. Mine wore out after years of enjoyment, so I ordered this one. Don't get this brand. It is from China, meaning that it is the cheapest product imaginable to mankind. I just ordered a different, much more high quality neck roll. Worth the extra $. Get the small size and start enjoying the straight life."
2,Doesn't last long,"It gets squished pretty fast. Also, it is thinner than it looks in the image (at least so it seems to me)."
4,Jack is back!!,"I won't bother to talk about the plot since it's covered by all the previous comments, but I do want to say that ""Jack is back!"" (and I don't mean Jack Bauer). I've read all the previous six Jack novels and Wilson has yet to run out of steam.This may sound strange, but I would like to see F. Paul Wilson do a Jack novel without the supernatural element, where Jack just does his ""repairs"" on the bad guys ala Equalizer/Godfather style. Most of his books have such subplots unrelated to the main supernatural one, and I find these quite entertaining. I bet Wilson could pull it off."
5,High Voltage Thriller,"This entry in the Repairman Jack series doesn't feature quite as many of the usual set piece where Jack helps people get even, but it doesn't need them either. The strength of this book comes in the exploration of Jack's relationship with his father, which is brought about when Jack's elderly dad is injured in a car accident in Florida. The Everglades makes for a great setting in this latest battle with The Otherness, while the colorful cast of characters and action-packed adventure make this book well worth reading."
4,Jack goes to Florida,"This here is 7th Repairman Jack novel, and the first to leave the New York City area Jack makes his home ground. Responding to a emergency with his father, Jack travels south and gets involved with deformed Southerners. Excellent ending to this one, while Jack fights the Otherness in the midst of hurricane Elvis."
3,"Great look, small defect.","Stendhal's jaw falls of when attempting to open his mouth. His competition Thoron remains intact. however, the dragon looks fantastic. What great design."
1,Item Intended for Sale at Staples,"So I got this item not knowing what I was getting into. This item comes with a label on it. Label states THIS ITEM INTENDED FOR SALE AT Staples. IF FOUND AT OTHER OUTLETS, CALL 1-866-877-3836.The number turns out to be Ethics Hotline which investigates items sold outside Staples. Now after printing just a few hundred pages, the toner is out of ink. Hence paying $27 means I purchased product which was not as advertised and probably it was a display item for in-store use. Hence it is out of ink.This is my follow-up feedback."
1,Styli-Steals 24-Hour Power Flat Liner 24-Eyes - Black/Brown,This item is horrible!! it does not even transfer. I called and had a new one sent to me ...same thing!!So hard it will not even leave a mark on my hand after rubbing it back and forth HARD! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!Used other pencils from this line and love them.
5,Perfect,"Just what the wife wanted, so it got me big brownie points. Delivery was faster than expected."
4,Great accessory,"I have had the old hand crank pasta maker, and used it infrequently. This one MUCH more fun and easy to use. Cleanup is not a big deal. Only reason I did not give it 5* is the price, but with the recent rebate, the sting is not so bad. The pasta is much better than any store bought we have ever had. Texture is just different - more ""chewy"" is the only way I know to describe it. Be aware, you might make a mess, but fun to use."
1,Broke during 1st use!,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it broke the 1st time she tried to use it. Now she is dealing with Kictchenaid to get it replaced. What a hassle for a supposedly new item.
2,does not clean well,"the pasta roller set is a nice tool for making homemade pasta but its a hassle to form sheets thru one roller, wait a few minutes for the machine to cool down, then roll it thru the other to cut it. the biggest drawback is the cleaning instructions for the roller. it is not supposed to be washed with water! just leeting it dry and then cleaning it with a dry cloth doesnt really help. i had to return the whole thing!"
5,Fun for the kids too...,"I have owned this atachment for almost a year now and it is probably the best attachment you can get for the kitchenaid. It is quick, easy and fun to make homemade pasta. My kids love to help. We have made some great spinach pasta with this attachment. It is a bit pricey but well worth the money. My only complaint is that they aren't dishwasher or water freindly. They do take some tiem to clean up if your a neat freak. The brush that is included does a good job but be patient and let the pasta residue firm up before trying to clean."
5,Great attachment!,"This is a very heavy, well made attachment, unlike the other plastic offering from KitchenAid. It's easy to use and clean too."
1,Part broken,"I purchased this product throught Simply Beautiful via Amazon in May as a gift for my girlfriend, since she had really wanted the three piece set to go with her Kitchen Aid. We made the mistake of not using it until August. At which time we found out that one of the three rollers (pasta sheet roller) did not work. So I inform the company Simple Beautiful, via amazon, to see if we could get that roller replaced. Unfortunately, the 90 return period had ended.While I fault myself for not ensuring brand new equipment works right out of the box ""immediately"", I am dissappointed that this company would not replace the pasta roller. It's not like we didn't want to keep the set, we do. It's just that I now have to spend $70 to get a new individual pasta roller. Well two lessons for me 1) always open gifts for other peole to see if they work ""immediately and 2) never allow an Amazon purchase where Simply Beautiful is the supplier."
5,Pasta Attachment for Kitchenaid,"This was sent to my daughter-in-law for her birthday. It was received, opened and immediately used, again and againKitchenaid KPRA Pasta Roller Setfor Stand Mixers--what better review?!"
4,Exactly what we were hoping for!,"Great product. Easy to use. Wish it was a little longer so you could run a larger sheet in, but otherwise fabulous! We made some delicious pasta!!"
2,Pasta: Art or Science,"I'm a pasta neophyte. Making my own bread has convinced me there's as much art as science in a good dough but I've tried these attachments with 3 different recipes with disappointing results each time. Fettuccine performance was so-so, making hand-separable noodles but the linguine cutter is really lousy. It just makes a corrugated ribbon."
4,Great product for me,"Great product for me. I tried it with a basic egg/flour recipe and it worked great. I mixed the dough using the technique of mounding the flour and putting the eggs in the center. 4 eggs, 3 cups flour and 1 tablespoon water.One thing I would say is try to get your dough about the consistancy of pie dough. Not sticky but it should be wet enough to be one mass, not a bunch of folds. If it is too dry or sticky you can always add water (1 tablespoon at a time ) or flour to the dough to get it the consistancy you want."
5,do what they should,"These rollers perform exactly as they should. no issues. we use them about once a week. they do require some TLC, but that's expected with things that have flour mixed in with mechanics."
5,Awesome attachment!,"If you're bored some day, buy these attachments and just make some awesome pasta! This machine is a blast to use - it reminds me of putting playdoh through my fun factory as a kid. But hey, NOW you can eat what comes out! I had so much fun making pasta from these attachments that I can't wait to make more. It makes lasagna noodles, thick and thin fettucine and ravioli noodles. When you cook them immediately without drying them first, it makes for a much more filling dinner and just so very, very good. This became a family event - we were all putting the dough through this thing and having a ball dumping the noodles into the hot pan of water. You absolutely have to get these attachments if you have the mixer - the pasta is so very good and it really is nice to make something so wholesome for your family to eat. One of the best meals I've ever made by far. Besides, it's just fun!"
1,not good at all.... from an Italian,"I purchased my KA mixer a few weeks ago and I just got now this attachment. I was really looking forward to get it, I'm Italian, living outside my Country, and I always made home made pasta by hand. Well, the mixer worked fine, the flat pasta came out allright after trying a few times, byt spaghetti and fettuccine were a total mess. The spaces are too close and the spaghetti will come out attached one to each other. They are drying right now, but they look more like lasagna than spaghetti.... And I tried to use more and more flour, let it dry first... nothing worked. A real waste of money, I'll take out my old manual machine, way better.Don't waste any money on this!"
1,"Solid Outside, Fragile Inside","Sadly, what the other negative reviews have written is most definitely true. While the frame and rollers are constructed very well out of heavy metal, the inside axle and gears are plastic and can *very* easily snap rendering your roller useless, as KitchenAid doesn't sell replacement parts for them."
1,A Lot Of Work,"When I used this pasta roller, there was grease on the inside of the roller and it kept getting on the pasta, with no way to clean the inside of it. It was very diffiult to feed the pasta into the roller and the pasta recipe included was too dry. I returned this to Filenes and with the same money, I bought the Ron Popeil pasta maker, which is very easy to uses and requires almost no work on your part. Don't buy this, buy the other Ron pasta maker. With Ron Popeil, you can just through in the ingredients and pasta comes out."
1,A defective product. Stay away from it. Sue it if you know laws.,"The pasta roller stopped working only after a couple of uses. When opened it, I was extremely surprised to find out that it is using a plastic part to carry over the torque generated from the mixer. How can't you use a plastic part for do such a crucial job?!! It is a design problem from the beginning. It is NOT a random quality problem!!If I am lawyer or are familar with law, I would definitely sue this company. This crappy design is all by intention."
1,Poor packaging in shipment damaged product,"I just received this product to give as a Christmas gift. So, I am really rating the packaging and not the product. Equipment this heavy cannot be put in a cardboard box of the same size as the KitchenAid box. Something punctured a hole in the outer box, interior box and dented one of the rollers. The KA box should have been protected with a couple of layers of bubble wrap. Instead of a convenience of ordering online, this is a big aggravation now with a trip to the UPS Store."
3,Not too happy.,"While I was excited about making pasta, I found the process long and tedious. The recipe required much more liquid. The pasta really needed to be hung to dry and needed more cooking than the recommended time."
1,Watch out for shipping times,"I ordered the product from the amazon web pages which states that it USUALLY ships in 24 hrs. I learned the next day that it would not ship for 2-3 WEEKS from WHOLESALERSCLUB. I had a gift card from AMAZON so OK FINE I'll wait. I decided to check the amazon site again expecting the change in shipping times. What do I see, it is still posted as a 24 hr ship time!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I had no idea making homemade pasta could be so easy! Have only used it once so far, used the roller device to make lasagna noodles and it was great. Was very easy to use, directions with the item were good and easy to follow. Was surprised at how quickly I could make it and it came out delicious! Have never used a different type of pasta maker, but definitely no need to ever try any other product. Hopefully the other attachments will work as easily."
5,Worth the cost,I was so happy that I got this! The price was right and the rollers work great. If you want them get them!
5,Pasta Roller-Cutter a Gem!,I don't know what the earlier negative reviews were all about - I had no issues. My dough recipe worked marvelously and the rolls worked it down to the perfect thinness. It is great havin two hands free to work both ends of the dough strip! I made revioli witht he sheets and I am very happy. Richard S. - New Jersey
5,Love this!!!!,I have been making pasta everyday now because it's so easy to use and amazing ! life savor ! does everything for you. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Love kitchen aid appliances !
5,Great pasta,The roller makes rolling thin homemade pasta sheets easy. The cutters provide uniform wide or narrow pasta. Its great to be able to use your own homemade recipes.
2,Product has some issues,"I am a big kitchenaid fan. I have had this pasta maker for approx. 2 years and it is great. However, today the metal shaft that turns the rollers sheared, making the item useless. If the item was cheap (it is not) or make of plastic, I might not be so upset. But the shaft is solid metal and should not have sheared. It is my belief, that making pasta should not cause a solid metal shaft to shear. Mfg said item is out of warranty so they will not replace. Now I must decide to buy new one ($89+)or roll pasta by hand."
2,"Lasagna Yes, Fettuccine No, Spaghetti No",Rolls out beautiful lasagna dough if you follow the receipt.The instruction manual is wrong when it says you can cut pasta dough at the #4 or #5 thicknesses.The fettuccine and spaghetti strands stick together as it comes out of the cutter. I called KitchenAid and the customer service person said you had to roll Spaghetti to #5 or #6 and Fettuccine to #7 or #8. These settings are too thin for my taste. KitchenAid offered to sell me a new one at a discount. I declined.
4,love the home made pasta,"The recipe that comes in the book sucks...seems too dry, yet the ones in the Joy of Cooking are far too moist. It still seems to take 3 people to easily make the pasta but it is sooooo good when finished. We bought a clothes drying rack from the local hardware store to put the pieces of pasta as we were making it. It is a lot cheaper at $7 than pasta dryers, which to my eye, looked far too small. All in all, I like this pasta maker. I have another mixer at a second home and wish the price would come down (alot) so that I could buy another one. It is certainly easier than attaching the manual machine to the counter."
4,Great Product and a lot of fun too,"I really enjoy this attachment. We have a Bed and Breakfast in Alaska, and use this mostly for ourselves when we want fresh pasta, or specialty pasta, Like Chocolate Dessert Pasta... My only complaint is I never got my rebate! So dont count on the rebate if one is offered when you buy it!!!!"
2,No Repairs Available!,"I loved using the pasta roller and the cutters, but slightly over a year later I noticed that the linguine cutter had slipped a spring on the bottom, which allowed the scraping plate to come loose. I contacted KitchenAid and was told basically, ""Sorry, nothing we can do"". They said the cutters are not repairable, and are not sold individually. Their only suggestion was to purchase a new complete set of cutters from them! At the price they charge, I highly doubt that I will be doing that!Buy the set if you want to, but be aware that KitchenAid won't help you if they are out of warrantee and something breaks!"
2,Fatal flaw,"We have had this unit for over a year, and it is still shedding metal particles into our pasta. We keep hoping that they will go away soon, if we keep using it. No luck yet. Continue to cut out big metal shavings from our finished noodles. If we didn't have this issue, it would be a 5-star unit. Otherwise sturdy and mechanically sound."
1,KPRA - Kitchen Aid Pasta Roller Attachment set,"I was very disappointed with the Pasta Roller. The plastic on the bottom of the rollers interferred with the pasta rolling process. It started out good, and not too far into the process the dough starting getting caught in the one end of the plastic and would not go through the other side and we had to use the manual pasta machine instead. I had to return the item. I do not understand why the plastic is on the bottom of the rollers, you do not see this on the manual machine, and the plastic is not on the other pasta rollers in the set."
5,Pasta anyone,Love it- wanted this for years- very easy to use- didn't have a lot of trouble cleaning. Used for my Perogis this year and liked the ease of use. Plan to make lots of pasta with it.
4,How we solved the oil problem..,"I received the pasta maker as a gift, and I too had oil all over my first batch. My son, the machinist told me ""Buy a small Bottle of vodka and brush it thru' the gears. The vodka will evaporate and you can saturate the rollers effectively. I had already called customer service, but they wanted me to return it and replace it. Well, I called them again to tell them of our solution. I was gobsmacked when, about a week later customer service sent me a coupon to spend on my next Kitchenaid attachment! They have my loyalty forever"
2,Either does not age well or needs periodic maintenance,I bought these attachments back in 2005 or so and except for a few cleanings they've never left the shelf or have been used. Today I discovered the white plastic scrappers on the roller one is cracked at about a dozen places and I assume if I run it they'll crumble. This product either doesn't age well or needs periodic lube job.
4,Italy in the USA,"After reading reviews, we decided to purchase this item in advance of hosting a ""Italy in the USA"" dinner party for 14. The product did a great job. I had read that when you first use it that you will get some metal debris in your first batch of pasta, so I ran a damp paper towel through several times and really had no problem. It made easy work of the job...only negative is you can't submerge in water to clean - but it seemed to clean up ok."
5,KichenAid Pasta Roller Attachment for STand Mixers,"I love these pasta attachments. If you love pasta, these attachments are fun and easy to use!!"
5,Pasta made easy,Love this product!!!! I will never buy store bought pasta again!!!! Great to involve family and friends when making pasta. I recommend this tool to anyone who loves pasta.
4,On time,I order this item late as a Christmas present think I would have to put a picture in a box under the tree. I was delivered a day early. Good experience.
5,Useful attachment,The most useful attachment for KitchenAid mixer for the price of $150 or less. I'll try the ice-cream maker next time when the price is right.
5,Fabulous!,"I first attempted to make pasta with my mixer and a rolling pin. Bad idea! The dough hook on my big KitchenAid Pro mixer can handle the dough... to a point, but it gets tough toward the end and the jerking motion eventually kicks the bowl off of its pins. I had my brother knead it then I tried to roll it by hand. It took forever and was not a consistent thickness. I have arthritic hands, including joint replacements, so I can't knead and roll a tough dough easily. So, I decided to buy the pasta roller set. What a difference!The dough rolls through this so easily and because it's motorized, you have both hands free to handle it. I made ravioli from the plain flat dough and did some linguini, as well. It worked tremendously well. These components are *heavy* and seem to be of excellent quality. So far, I'm very impressed with them, just like I've been with the rest of my KitchenAid items."
4,Great Product!,"After reading the reviews about cleaning this product, I am pleasantly surprised! My daughter and I mixed up a recipe of the basic dough in the handbook, and it came out great! Very easy to use, and no problem cleaning. I think it depends on the consistency of the dough as to whether or not dough gets stuck. Definatly a great product, there's nothing better than fresh pasta!"
5,Works great!,"This product works great! The Peter Pasta video (cooking.com and uTube) was great to show how to use it. It is simple! I read the reviews of the various past options from KitchenAid and this one got the best reviews - and they are right! We made ravioli and fettucini so far with great success. We just used a simple VillaWare 10 square ravioli maker along with this product and were delighted. The only negative thing is that I opened the pasta maker, put it in my sink to wash it before I saw the label to not submerged the parts. So, a word of caution - don't submerge the parts!"
4,Very nice pasta making set,"I like the fact that the pasta maker sits high and it makes it easier to collect the pasta instead of a table top model.Warning: Don't listen to the Just Me reviewer above about getting a free Amazon $500 gift card. You'll pay dearly for it in money and time wasted by going through the long Three Step qualifying process. To qualify, you MUST finally apply for a home/auto loan to get your FREE (yeah right) gift card."
2,Disappointing,"The information in this book is very basic and poorly presented. In a few instances I think some of the terminology used tended to convey the author's personal views more than a professional, unbiased, report of history. I tried to read the book in its entirety but I just don't think I can. It is free so if you want to give it a go...you won't feel bad for wasting money at least. I doubt you'll be able to finish the whole thing though, if you are an avid history reader. I think any given text book would be more informative."
2,Poor book,"This book isn't very informative and is somewhat poorly written. It leaves out a lot of important information and states the obvious in every section. I could have written this myself, though I'd be embarrassed if I did. I don't recommend this, but I guess for a free book it wouldn't do any harm to try it out."
1,At least it was free,"If the poor spelling and grammar weren't enough to irritate me, the content of this book took me to that place. Once I started reading it, I was compelled to continue because of how shockingly ethnocentric and subjective this supposed History book was written. The ebook is worth the price."
2,Surprised I didn't like it...boring read,"I am shocked I didn't find this book interesting. I tried and tried, but I lost interest almost immediately. The reviews are great on this, but I couldn't seem to find what they saw that I missed.The story dragged to the point of yawning. Too much details on how to make beans and bacon on an open fire and too much conversation about nothing between secondary characters made me cringe and want to flip to the end to find out what happened to Eirica.I liked the promise in the storyline, but felt like the author wasn't concentrating enough on the main character of an abused and broken woman who was trying to start her life over with 3 kids and one on the way. The male lead of James Jones was too tame and boring for me and found him non-essential to the story.I really wish I could've enjoyed the book since everyone else did, but I am sorry to say I found it terribly lacking but will try this author again to see if maybe I missed something this time.Tracy Talley~@"
3,So-So,"I bought this book in 2004 when I first started getting into Nascar, and even back then it was a little outdated. Now, with all the changes in rules and even teams, its more than ""a little outdated"". One of the chapters includes a list of drivers to watch for in the future, including Champion Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Junior along with some drivers who barely race now. Even the information on tracks is past tense by now. For instance, we went to Lowe's Motor Speedway and followed his information on where race shops were located, only to discover that 90% of those had moved to different cities/locations. There are some basics in here that the newbie might appreciate, but be warned that it isn't up to date."
5,"Even the ""Pro's"" need to read this book",As a die-hard NASCAR fan since 1984 I hate to admit all the things that I learned from this book.This book is great at explaining the NASCAR scoring system and how the purse is divided not to mention all these bonuses that are available even if you have the best finish using a brand of motor oil.This is a must buy book for old and new NASCAR fans.
4,Good intro for the NASCAR novice,"I wanted to learn about NASCAR and knew nothing about it... and this book did a good job of introducing it to me. My one complaint is it doesn't talk enough about what's going on in the actual races, and I still feel a little lost about what exactly is happening on the track, how exactly the race works, and what specific strategies the drivers are using. A little more on the actual racing and this book would've been perfect. But it's still an excellent intro if you're looking to learn about the sport."
4,nascar for dummies,was watching the cbs pre daytona 2000 show where they interviewed Martin. seems he was in bed for a while following back surgery and my money is book was taped during this time. taped because you can hear Martin talking to you about nascar and personal stories and facts and he even repeats himself like a person does when talking to you - sorta like that. really enjoyed it - nascar for dummies or the average joe from a drivers perspective - heck my wife started reading it and she is not a racing fan. yes the book does not appeared to be edited that much. pick a topic and Martin talks about it and it goes to the printer. but where do we find such honesty today ? had some questions myself wish could ask but life is never perfect so will gladly accept this offering of a view from inside nascar.
5,a terrific reference,"I work in research at a sports marketing firm. When I started my job, I knew nothing about NASCAR, but this book has not only explained it very clearly, it's actually gotten a born-and-bred Northeasterner to follow the Winston Cup series."
5,All good,"Awesome, the book and the service !All the basics are clearly explained, so you could share with non-fan ..."
4,I now understand.,This book was well written and very easy to understand. I knew nothing about Nascar before I read it. After reading it I now watch some of the races and can follow them. A very good book.
4,Great for new fans,"Hi,I just got into NASCAR racing this year after the Dayton 500. I order this book in hopes that it would explain some stuff. It did exactly that. it explained alot of stuff to me. I think this is a great book for any new fan."
1,These are awful,Baron Baptiste may be a great teacher but you wouldn't know it from these videos. Some of the worst Yoga videos I've ever seen... And I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave it a star at all was because I couldn't submit a review without it.
2,Yet another spin to the clueless titles,"Like a formulaic layout and writing style, Jim and company continues to write title after title to attempt to ""dominate"" bookstores, but sadly, the content is more form than function, and shows the hollowness of the content. Still, if you are a book designer, this serves as a good example of layouts."
3,Solid overview,"A solid overview of the advertising industry. Gives some answers to questions students and people just getting into the business won;t find anywhere else. However, the book is pretty thin and small considering the price."
5,Fantastic purchase,"This knife is great. I did a lot of research before I bought it, and it paid off. My friend has a $300 Blackhawk and would always brag about his knife, but even he was impressed with this knife and the ease of opening. Didn't hurt that this knife was 1/6 the price of his."
4,kershaw speed bump,I like everything about the knife. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because I was sent a gray and black handled knife. Not the the black color in the picture. Nice blade and well balanced. I like the pocket clip too. KERSHAW IS A GREAT KNIFE MANUFACTER. I also own the ken onion rainbow leek. Also a great knife.
2,It's hard to turn!,"I'm looking for a new stroller as I have had this for 5 mths and I've had enough of trying to steer it with two hands (impossible to steer with one hand).The basket is not accessible so I have only used it a couple of times and when I did, objects would scrape along the ground.The harness isn't good as my daughter can wiggle and loosen them in a minute.The adjustable seat doesn't sit upright enough which makes her want to get out even more.The footmuff can only be used by little ones as it seems to be too small (I tend to take off her shoes so its more comfortable).The net drink holder has become my key and phone holder as I wounldn't dare put drinks in there.I love the adjustable handles and rain cover, though!"
3,Useful but hard to put together!,"This Fast Track hardware is very useful but it was so difficult to put together. The attachment to the rail comes in two loose pieces and it has to be attached to the shelf unit which of course cannot lay flat because of the shape. The metal posts have to go into the attaching bracket and a little square metal piece has to be pushed into the slot. You need pliers and a death-grip or one of those pliers that can be tightened little by little until that metal piece is forced in far enough.I will stick to the hooks which come assembled in one piece. If I knew how hard it was, I would have looked for a store that had it already assembled."
3,Works fine,"This is one of the better fasttrack gadgets, as it provides a little shelf space and three good hooks."
3,Sturdy material - but assembly is tricky and cannot be undone,"I accidently assembled this product wrong and could not undo it. I was bummed that that instructions did not warn about this. As it stood,this product was useless and I had to return it for a replacement because I was locked into the whole Rubbermaid system with rail and hooks. I would be extra careful about assembly if you need this product. Unfortunately, there are no other substitute products that one can but for the Rubbermaid system that have the same purpose as this item else I would've gladly substituted"
4,Great for the price,"This little unit is not, of course, going to compete with Bose or any of the other high end units out there. However, this has pretty good sound for an under $100 station. It sounded better than just about any of the other models I plugged my ipod into at a couple stores. I didn't bother with the $200 or more units, because that was more than I was willing to pay. I have a smaller house and this does more than a good job filling it with decent sound. If that's what you want, I'd say go ahead and get one. If you like to crank it till the paint peels...of course, this isn't the unit for you."
4,Good equipment,"Good sound, nice design, nice neoprene cover...Negative aspect: pressing the ffwd or rew button on the remote control does not change the video that is currently being reproduced."
3,logitech ipod station,"The product for the cost is not bad. Sound quality is acceptable and it can be portable with batteries. However, the product was shipped from Hardware Cooling and the remote does not work well. The buttons do not consistently work. I notified them of this issue but they did nothing to rectify my complaint. Otherwise, it is easy to use and operate."
4,As Good as it Gets,"The Logitech Audio Station has excellent tone and volume. The only item thatprevents it from getting 5 stars is that certain buttons on the remote don't work. Only the volume and on and off buttons seem to function. You can't stop it, pause it or move it to the next track. These however are minor problems. It plays very well."
4,Great sound,"This is an excellent system, but don't be misleaded by its size. It packs a good bit of sound but the quality decreases when you turn the volume way down. It sounds very distant when its quiet. Also, the little remote doesn't always work. Otherwise it sounds awesome with full volume."
5,nice little speakers w/case and remote,"pretty decent little ipod sound system. the case and remote are just well thought out additions. sound is decent for the size, and the unit didn't run out of juice on batteries even after 5 hours of continuous play."
4,Great for the price,The audiostation is great for the price. It is small easy to pack and carry around and requires only 6 AA batteries that last a long time. good for the pool and picknicks. the sound quality is not as crisp or as loud as a boes system. but wont break your budget like one either
3,Looks good!!!,This is pretty good for the price it is not gonna sound as good as bose but it is efficient.
2,OK product at this price,"The sound quality is just ok at this price. However, the remote controller has difficulty to control my ipod touch. Won't recommend to buy."
1,cannot review never got it.,"never go this product.maybe the incorrect address,don't know what happen along the way, but did not get to the address, where it should have been sent.Dorothy H."
3,Not bad for the price!,"The ""Pioneers of The New"" album reminds me of the older works of Shadowfax and other instrumental bands. This would be a good atmosphere or easy listening selection, but remains rather bland and without moving performances. It's still a good CD for the price!"
2,MARTIN & LEWIS,"STRICTLY FOR DIE-HARD FANS ONLY. THE EARLY ""JERRY LEWIS"" WORK GETS ON MY NERVES, HIS TALENT IMPROVED TOWARDS THE MID 1950s IN HIS FILMS WHEN HE CREATED A CHARACTER THAT EVOKES SYMPATHY AND LIKEABILITY. BUT HIS EARLY WORK IS TOO MAD, THAT NASAL VOICE HE USED TO ADOPT IS SOOO IRRITATING.FOR LEWIS GENIUS, BUY ""THE DISORDERLY ORDERLY"" ""ARTISTS AND MODELS"" - BETTER CHOICE THAN THESE TV APPEARANCES ON ""COLGATE COMEDY HOUR"".THE SHOW CHOICES WERE SO RANDOM TOO.2 STARS ONLY"
1,NOT SO GREAT,Was not as great as I thought. Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin are better in movies then this sidcom shows
1,Dean Martin Jerry Lewis Collection,I didn't get what I thought it was going to be. Can I please return this package?
2,way too dark,"Goes on easy, but turns your floors very dark. I had my kitchen floors (red oak) done with a polyurethane finish and they came out a light honey color. I did the rest of the house with Waterlox and the finish is a very dark red. Very disappointing, because I understood that Waterlox was supposed to give your floor a lighter color."
3,IS OK,"As a final finish Waterlox works OK, but I like Minwax Wipe On Poly better because it goes on easy & gives a harder finish."
3,"eh, not impressed","the speeds are fine. the only reason i didn't score it higher was the beaters aren't very effective. i like ones w/ flat edges to them. flat edges seem to cut butter, spuds and whatnot up a lot more effectively. the rounded edge ones that come w/ this mixer takes 3x longer to mix butter and just not as well as the flat edged beaters.. i bake alot so this is important to me. i haven't tried the corkscrew beaters yet.wouldn't buy it again."
3,Dough hooks? Why bother?,"For normal-duty tasks like cake batter, frosting, or egg whites, which are my most-frequent mixing tasks, this is a good mixer. I have no complaints about it, except that the high speed is not as fast as I'd like. I'm hoping it lasts for many years, though, because for half the money I could get something that does those jobs adequately but would only last a couple of years (like my last hand held mixer).I have NO IDEA, however, why they include dough hooks, as there is no way that this mixer is able to handle bread dough. I tried once, just to see, and it started making the scary sort of noises that let me know the motor was just not up to it. I wasn't surprised, since from reviews I've read, even some of the KA stand mixers can barely handle bread dough."
3,nahhhh....,"I never did care for this mixer much, although it was better than having none at all. The cheesy wire beaters bent out of shape... I never dared use the dough hooks (for dough that is--but what else would you use them on?) It is just not powerful enough for dough. Overall, I think this is worth $20-25 but definitely not the $70+ that I see listed here. However, I wouldn't ever buy anything with the thin wire beaters again. It is just pointless. Anything they will mix can be done easier by hand..."
2,A hamster could mix faster,"I bought this mixer thinking (like many others) that the higher price tag (vs. my old $20 hand mixer) would mean more power, less time cooking, etc. I seriously could train a hamster to stir faster than this overpriced piece of junk. The highest speed is laughable..you could probably stick your hand in the bowl in the middle of mixing and *maybe* get pinched. If you even think about using the bread hook you'll blow the motor...it can't handle it.Like another review said, it goes to show that a higher price tag does not mean higher quality. Save yourself the money and either get the $20 Sunbeam or go big and get a stand mixer (which is what I'm going to do)."
5,solid unit,"Does what you expect it to, and seems durable. Doesn't feel or smell hot like cheaper models when you use it for a long time."
4,more power,"lots more power then other hand mixers i've owned, but the speed isn't there if you need that.. had it about a year now, and it's plowed through everything i've asked it to without any smell of the motor cooking.2 thumbs up. waaaaaaaay up"
2,Not impressed,"We registered for this mixer on our wedding registry. I was excited to be getting a mixer that cost more than $12. I was SO disappointed by it, that I used it twice and then gave it to my mom. That thing was so slow, and had no power. I was thinking that maybe we just got a bad one, but after reading some of these other reviews, I think it's just the way this mixer is. Anyway, I replaced this Kitchenaid Mixer with a $19 Sunbeam from Target, and LOVE that one! Lesson learned: Just because it costs more, doesn't mean it's better!"
3,mediocre,"Ok mixer. managing with this until a kitchen-aid appears on my counter. kind of weak in thick cookie dough, but skips by everthing else. only a stand in until better comes along, would not buy for a gift."
1,No Power!,This hand mixer did not even have enough power at the highest speed to mix cake batter in a reasonable time. When I was using it a friend was over and was even shocked that it had no power. I would have expected more from a KitchenAid product.
5,Great hand mixer,"If you're looking for an awesome hand mixer, look no further. The Kitchenaid name stands for itself (no pun intended there!) with their stand mixer and this hand mixer is no different. I've had mine for 10 years now and just love it. It goes from mixing bread dough to mixing a rue with the greatest of ease and never, never have I ever had even a hint of the motor getting hot, overheated, etc., as you get with regular hand mixers. All I can say is that Kitchenaid has found the mix and put their genius in the hand mixer. It's worth every penny you pay for it and more so don't be afraid to grab this one. It was newly out when I first purchased mine but seeing it was Kitchenaid, I wouldn't buy any of the others because quite frankly, mom's always burned up until she bought one of those!"
3,"I want to love it, but...","I love Kitchenaid products, usually. But this mixer is more of a stirer than a mixer. It'll mix fine, and has lots of torque, but to whip anything? Forget it. You better have all day, this mixer is just geared improperly, plain and simple. Possible fix would be the add on whisks, but why should I have to buy add-ons to make this mixer perform as it should? Look for mine on the refurb rack, it's going back."
1,Good mixer; bad beater lock,"This is a good mixer: sturdy beaters, reasonable range of speeds, solid in the hand. However, the beater locking mechanism stinks. Don't know if the other Kitchenaids have the same problem. I'm posting this to save current owners from buying a new mixer.After the twentieth time having one beater fall out while running and just before opening the garbage can lid, I decided to try a quick fix--which worked. Take a small piece (less than 1 inch square) of kitchen plastic wrap and place it over the beater end that goes into the mixer. Smooth it around the beater shaft and insert into the mixer. It will--and should--be snug. Twist it back and forth and push until it goes in all the way. Insert the other beater. To remove, push hard on the beater release, while pulling on the beater if necessary. Use a new piece of wrap each time."
2,I wish I hadn't,"Yes, I'm sure it will last a long time. However, this thing is so slow it drives me mad. When you are in the middle of a recipe and want to whip something quickly it takes so long it's infuriating. The fastest setting is just not adequate. I regret spending my money on this. I do a lot of baking and cooking and will be looking for a better model."
2,Fired for lack of performance,"I'm finally deciding to replace this mixer. I have owned it for years (and if you think that is a GOOD thing, read on ...), but I have always been disappointed in its mixing power from Day 1. A month ago, I had an opportunity to use my mother-in-law's hand mixer from the 1970s, and was amazed at its power, even on the lower settings. That made me decide to give my current KitchenAid Ultra Power hand mixer the heave-ho. It is SO wimpy, and there is very little difference between the 5 speed settings. I think mine has lasted so long because not much is required of the motor. Certainly, it can handle cake batter just fine, but that's not all I demand from a mixer. I like knowing a mixer has extra power even if I don't need to use it very often. Not sure yet what I will buy as a replacement, but I wish I could go back to the 70s and purchase the mixer my mother-in-law has (and maybe say no to that disco dress I bought)."
2,Hand Mixer,"One of the things that turn doesn't fit well and falls out. I should have exchanged it, but I didn't have the time."
4,nice little mixer,"This is a great little mixer for every day baking. Its light in weight and has enough power for cake mixes, mashed potatoes, and whisking cream and egg whites. I wouldn't use it for really heavy batters like cookie dough as it doesn't feel like it packs that kind of power."
1,Unexpected,This was not what I expected. The letters are back to back so you will need to make a copy of the page you want otherwise you cut into the letters on the back of the page
4,Doo Wop Classics,"Excelent CD - especially if you are a ""seasoned"" senior. Brings back memories of the 50's. Will probably purchase more in the future."
3,Hard to find miniature shoes,We have a granddaughter who collects miniature shoes and these are not easy to find. I usually purchase a few of these shoes at a time (to save on shipping costs). I have never had a problem with this company and will purchase from them again.
2,Slightly overrated,"All of the popes I WOULD like to know more about, LACK in this book. That just about resumes it all. We have a saying in our country: ""Lots of wool"", said the farmer, and he shaved his pig. The book is shamelessly overrated. I thoroughly regret this purchase."
